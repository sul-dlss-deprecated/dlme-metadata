(2) Coast Report [a) General Description of Coast Persian Gulf General.—Persia, has an area of 628,000 square miles. It is bounded on the north by Russia and the Caspian Sea, on the west by Turkey and Iraq, on the east by Afghanistan and Baluchistan, and the south by the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea. Persia has therefore two sea-boards, of which the Persian Gulf is by far the more important. Notwithstanding her sea frontiers, Persia has few natural facilities for maritime traffic. The southern frontier, which is formed by the north coast of the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea, as far as Baluchistan, has no natural harbours and few sheltered anchorages. The principal Gulf ports are Abadan, Khorramshahr, Bandar Shapur, Bushire, Lingeh and Bandar Abbas. The Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman lie between the parallels of 22° and 30° N. and the meridians of 48° and 62° E. They are bounded on the south and south-west by the coastal districts of Arabia, at the head of the Gulf by Irak and on the north-west by the coastal region of south-west Persia. The Persian Gulf proper extends in a south-easterly direction for 460 miles from the mouth of the Shatt-al-Arab to the coast of the promontory of Oman—that great projection of the Arabian coast of which the point nearly blocks the entrance of the Persian Gulf, and of which the base is a line running from Abu Dhabi village to the Baraimi oasis, and thence to Sohar. Here the entrance to the Gulf narrows through the Straits 'of Hormuz to a width of 29 miles. The greatest width of the Gulf is 200 miles, narrowest at the Strait of Hormuz, 50 miles, and the head is 140 miles across. The Gulf of Oman may be said to be an arm of the Indian Ocean or Arabian Sea, which forms the approach to the Persian Gulf proper. The outer limit may be taken as a line joining Gwatar in Persian Makran to Ras-al-Hadd on the Arabian coast and at its inner end it joins the Straits of Hormuz. The coastal regions of the Gulf fall actually into three groups :— (i) At the head of the Gulf proper the coast of the alluvial plain of Iraq and Arabistan, and a part of Behbehan from the Khor Zobeir in the west to a point near Bandar Dilam in the east, and the districts inland as far as Khorramshahr and Ahwaz. This includes territory along the lower Shatt-al-Arab in the Persian province of S. Arabistan. (ii) On the Persian side the narrow coastal plain which lies between the shores of the Gulf and the main maritime range of the mountains from Bandar Dilam on the north to the frontier of Baluchistan at Gwatar, together with the mountainous hinterland forming the south side of the Tramian plateau. These comprise the maritime districts of the Persian province of Ears and Laristan, and the coastal district of the province of Persian Makran. (iii) On the Arabian side, the region which adjoins the south and south-west shores of the Gulf proper from the Khor-Zobeir on the north as far as the entrance at Cape Musandam, and thence along the projecting butt of the Arabian continent as far as Ras-al-Hadd. It includes Koweit, Hasa, Qatr, Trucial Oman and a part of the sultanate of Oman.6 (A) COAST [Part V — continued] The importance of the Persian Gulf lies principally in its relation to international communications. It has been a commercial and strategic highway between Europe and Asia for over 5,000 years. The head of the Gulf affords the natural outlet on the sea to the shortest route from central and southern Europe to India and the whole of the Gulf lies on the flank of any military movement through Persia in a similar direction. THE SOUTHERN COAST OF PERSIA FROM IRAQ TO BALUCHISTAN (1) The Shatt-aLArab to Ras-al-Bahrgan (Admiralty Charts 1265 and 2837B) The Persian coast at the head of the Gulf is composed mainly of mud flats and marshes which extend 60 miles inland round the Khor Musa inlet (up which is the port of Bandar Shapur, see (B) Ports), together with Abadan Island to the west. The tracks across the marshes keep more than 40 miles inland and are motorable only in dry weather. Abadan Island (to the north of which stands the port of Khorramshahr [see (B) Ports), where the Karun river joins the Shatt-al-Arab by the Hafar Channel) is a low desert plain, 40 miles long, between the Shatt-al-Arab to the south-west and the Bahmanshir (Bahmishir) river to the north-east. The island is bordered by date groves and cultivation, except on the seaward side which is swampy. On the north-west side stands the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s refinery and port of Abadan (see (B) Ports). The Bahmanshir river is the natural mouth of the Karun river, but most of the Karun water was diverted to the Shatt-al-Arab when the Hafar Channel was dug in mediaeval times, and the upper Bahmanshir is now very shallow. The coast between the Bahmanshir and the Khor Musa, 20 miles east, is composed of wide tidal mud flats, intersected by shallow channels. Inland of them are extensive marshes which are usually flooded and inhabited only by wild fowl. Farther inland are flat plains which are liable to flood in winter but are dry in summer, with shrubs and coarse grass, and are cultivated by irrigation or used for grazing. The Khor Musa is a deep water channel in the mud flats. It winds inland for 50 miles, and at the head is split into many intersecting channels. There is an anchorage 20 miles from the entrance where the Khor Qanaqeh joins the Khor Musa, and a further 20 miles up the channel lies the port of Bandar Shapur. On the left bank of the Khor Musa lies Fasht-al-Mua, a bank of sand and mud, which dries in patches and extends 12 miles to the east towards Ras Tanub, from which point it is separated by the Khor Ghazlan. In this khor there are depths of 9 ft. About 1£ miles north-westward of Ras Tanub is the mouth of a river or creek with extensive ruins on its banks. The coast north-westward is nearly all covered at high water *and has not been surveyed ; it is fronted by tidal flats, which are intersected by a number of deep channels which have also not been surveyed. To the east of Ras Tanub lies a bay formed by the mouth of the Khor Ghazlan, into this runs the Hindian river, the delta of which forms Ras-al-Bahrgan. The coast of the bay consists of mud flats which give way to a wide grassy plain stretching north-east for more than 30 miles to the foothills of the Khuzistan mountains. Although parts of this plain are marshy during wet weather, there is no intervening marsh belt between the mud flats. The Hindian river enters the sea a few miles north-westward of Ras Bahrgan. It appears to have several mouths, forming a delta, but has only one main channel. The principal entrance is very shallow and has only been partially surveyed. Only small native craft normally use the river, but a steam vessel with a draught of 8 ft. has ascended as far as the village of Hindian. (2) Ras-al-Bahrgan to Bushire (Admiralty Chart 2837B) Ras Bahrgan is a low sandy strip which is nearly covered at high water ; inland the country is swampy for many miles and a bank, with depths of less than 3 fathoms, extends about 6 miles southward from the point. Mud flats, which dry, extend for some miles on either side of the point, and eastward of it landing is impossible, the mud being soft for about half a mile off shore. There are two conspicuous date groves about 3 miles northward of the point. The coast between Ras Bahrgan and Ras Tanb 30 miles to the eastward, forms an extensive bay. From Ras Bahrgan to the village of Shah-Abu-Shah the coast is low and may be approached in safety if soundings are taken, as the depths decrease regularly. Shah-Abu-Shah is situated on the hillocks at the head of Dilam Bay. A small creek gives access to the village and a large white-domed tomb is conspicuous. From Ras Bahrgan to the head of the bay the tide sets north-eastward and south-westward along the coast. Beyond Shah-abu-Shah the low sandy coast gradually gives way to a rocky strip about 10 to 15 ft. in height, which leads in a south-easterly direction to Dilam, 8 miles distant. Dilam is a small town in which there is a large and conspicuous square fort, in and around which the houses are built, and appears, when first sighted from seaward, as an island. This is now an unimportant fishing village but was, in the 18th century, a Dutch trading port. Mud flats, which dry, extend offshore, and in them there is a small creek where native craft can lie, but this also dries at low water. Landing is difficult even at high water. The bottom is hard sand for about 3 cables off shore, with soft mud further out. Anchorage may be obtained in a depth of about 4 fathoms in soft mud, 3| miles off shore, or in 3 fathoms in clay, about 2| miles from the village. The anchorage is sheltered from the shamal, and the kaus does not raise the usual sea, though it blows with strength.[Part V — continued'] (A) COAST (C58272) b4 A track only, leads from Dilam to the interior. In the hinterland of this area the coastal plain is between 15 and 35 miles wide and is sparsely cultivated, with date groves near many of the villages, but much of the land is salt-impregnated and barren. It contains two short ranges of coastal hills (Band-i-Gilal (highest peak 900 ft.) in the north-west, and Kuh-i-Bang (1,000 ft.) farther to the south east between Dilam and Ganaweh). Further inland are numerous parallel mountain ranges. Several small rivers meander across the coastal plain, and a dry-weather motor road runs along the coast. From Dilam the coast continues south for 5 miles to Ras Tanb, a low sandy point, from which a sandbank, which dries, extends nearly a mile, with depths of less than 3 fathoms some distance beyond it. The land inshore of this sandy coast is swampy for many miles with salt creeks and isolated hillocks. From Dilam southward the tidal stream sets northward and southward along the coast. Beyond Ras Tanb to the south-east are three small creeks, first Khor Lailatain, 1 mile distant, then Khor-al-Abd 3 miles south, and Khdr Sini a further 4 miles distant. Seven miles south of Khor Sini under the highest part of the Kuh-i-Bang is a series of prominent coastal hillocks about 50 ft. high; surmounting one of these is a small tomb. From this landmark the coast continues low and sandy with no reefs more than 2 cables off shore, in a south-easterly direction for about 7 miles to Sabz Pushan, a rocky point, rising steeply to hillocks from 40 to 50 ft. high ; on its summit is a tomb which cannot be seen until close inshore. A rocky reef fringes the point and extends about 1| cables off shore ; there is a small water course close eastward of the point. Between Sabz Pushan and Ganaweh (7 miles south-east) lies Haidari, a small village with a few date palms in its vicinity. Ganaweh consists of a group of three villages situated about half a mile inland, at which there are a few date palms and one particularly large and conspicuous banyan tree, also a large tomb with a spire. One and a half miles to the south is a small tidal river, the Khor Khalil; sands which dry, extend 2 cables from the mouth. Large dhows can enter the river at high water, and the A.I.O.C. have an establishment there with a small jetty. Living quarters are situated south-eastwards of the. entrance and at a short distance are a water tank, windmill pump and the depot buildings. The approach to Khor Khalil is across a bar, over which there are depths of from one to two feet at low water, distant about half a mile off shore. A small spar buoy surmounted by a brush is estab lished in the eastern side of the channel across the bar, and between it and the mouth of the river, that side of the channeHs marked in places by slender poles. Within Khor Khalil the greatest depths are on the starboard hand when entering, and about 2 cables within the entrance on the southern bank is the A.I.O.C. jetty, a concrete structure with steps; this affords good sheltered landing at all states of the tide. Ganaweh district was formerly prosperous, and the ruins of an ancient city cover the ground for more than a mile inland, but the river which then irrigated the plain has been diverted by an earthquake and the surrounding country is now very sparsely cultivated. Not far from the village is an emergency landing strip, and a metalled motor road runs from Ganaweh to the A.I.O.C. oilfield at Gach Saran, situated in the mountains 50 miles to the north- north-west. A light is exhibited on the coast, at an elevation of 27 ft., situated just to the north westward of the entrance to the Khor Khalil, and f-mile to the south-eastward of this river is a W/T station with two 120-ft. masts, which are the best marks for identifying the locality. Anchorage off Ganaweh may be obtained, in a depth of about 3 fathoms about \\ miles off shore south-westward of the conspicuous banyan tree. The holding ground, of clay and mud, is good ; large vessels can anchor further out. At low water, landing on the beach is bad, as several ridges of dry sand, with depth of about 2 ft. inside them must be crossed. From Ganaweh the coast continues low and sandy to Bandar Rig which lies 8 miles to the south- south-east. Bandan Rig is a small “ port ” but is also the principal town of the Persian coast sub district of Hayat Daud. There is a small tidal creek, fronted by two sandy islets, inside which native boats lie aground at low w^ter. In the eighteenth century it was the stronghold of a famous pirate whose fort was razed by British troops. In 1921 H.M.S. “ Cyclamen ” reported having anchored off Bandar Rig, in a depth of 2f fathoms, clay, with a white building in the centre of the town bearing 052°, distant 2f miles. The bottom shelves gradually towards the coast. The coast continues its south-south-easterly direction and low character to the mouth of a small perennial stream 10 miles distant and a further 13 miles to the entrance of Khor Hilleh Rud, a river which winds down to the sea through a small cultivated district with many villages and wells. This river is formed by the junction of the Shapur and Dalaki rivers, about 30 miles inland, and it floods regularly after the melting of the snow in the mountains. It is navigable by small craft to Hilleh Rud village, situated near a clump of date trees about 6 miles north-eastward of its mouth. The entrance of the river is shallow, and the sands are covered at high water. There are several other inlets on this part of the coast; their entrances are all shallow, but they have greater depths inside. Five miles south of Khor Hilleh Rud, with another stretch of low, sandy and occasional grass tufted coast intervening, lies Ras Ash Shatt, a point where the coast turns to the eastward to form the bay composed of sandbanks and mud flats, on the southern side of which stands Bushire [see (B) Ports). Off the coast 34 miles north-west of Bushire lies Jazirat Kharg [see plan on Chart 2837B). Jazirat Kharg is about 4| miles long and 2 miles wide, and contains barren table-topped hills running from north to south through the island. The western coast consists of several rocky points between which are sandy beaches, the hills on that side ending abruptly in cliffs. The eastern sidef 8 (A) COAST [Part V — continued] is low and sandy and adjoins a cultivated plain which terminates, on its north-eastern extremity, at a sandy point on which, near a village, stands a ruined trading-fort. The Custom House flagstaff, standing nearly half-a-mile southward of the fort, is difficult to identify as it is only a few feet high, painted black, and attached to the gable end of a house. The village dates from the Dutch occupation from 1748 to 1765. The A.I.O.C. have re-opened some stone quarries in the hills and stone for road making and building is exported to the mainland. The climate of Kharg is reported to be far less trying in the hot weather than that of Bushire. The island is fringed by a rocky reef which extends from 3 to 5 cables offshore and is steep-to. A sand pit, with depths of from 3^ to 6 fathoms, extends about 8 cables eastward of the north-eastern point. Because of its dark brown colour, the island can seldom be seen on a dark night, though in the moonlight it sometimes shows as a white streak, but not until close-to. There is a small mooring buoy, situated about 3^ cables north-eastward of the Custom House flagstaff (this is difficult to distinguish on certain bearings owing to trees in the vicinity), but this mooring is of little use, for there the south going tidal stream is a race over the spit, and attains great strength. The best landing on the island at low water is northward of the eastern angle of the fort, where there is a small pier ; at high water, landing can be made easily anywhere on the beach inside the reef. The most convenient summer anchorage, sheltered from the shamal, is on the eastern side of Jazirat Kharg, about 4 cables off shore in a depth of 8 fathoms, with the wedge-shaped hill bearing about 287°, just open southward of the ruins of the fort. In winter, vessels should anchor farther out in a depth of 10 fathoms, to facilitate shifting berth to the north-westward of the north-east point should a kaus come on to blow. In either position, however, the holding ground is rocky and indifferent. The small island of Jazirat Khargu, about 2 miles northward of the main island is composed of white sand with a thin covering of coarse grass. It is fringed, except at the northern end, by a flat rocky reef which extends 5 to 8 cables off shore, with depths of 6 to 10 fathoms outside. In the channel between the two islands the fairway between the reefs is about a mile wide and about 6 fathoms deep. In the vicinity of Jazirat Kharg and Jazirat Khargu, the tidal stream sets north-westward and south-eastward at a rate sometimes exceeding 2 knots. (3) Bushire to Ras Naband (Admiralty Chart 2837B) From the tip of the peninsula on which Bushire stands, the coast takes a south-easterly course to Reshire point, 5| miles distant, and thence to Ras Hallleh-about a further 6 miles. As far as Reshire the coast is low with occasional sandy beaches between outlying reefs ; there is a partially sheltered anchorage just east of Reshire (details under Bushire), and from there to Ras Hallleh the coast is rocky with cliffs from which reefs extend about 2 cables. Ras Hallleh is low, and from it a rocky spit extends about 4 cables south-westward. Hallleh is a village, about 7 cables north-north-westward of the point, and about a mile eastward of the point there are some clumps of date palms which extend inland to the marshes. Between Ras Hallleh and Bashi, 14 miles south-eastward, lies Hallleh bay, its shores are low and sandy, and over its greater part the depths are less than 2 fathoms, chiefly mud. Khor Khuvair, a small creek, the entrance to which dries, is entered near the head of the bay ; near it stands a small fort and date grove. About 2 miles north-westward of Khor Khuvair is the mouth of a large creek which drains the Mashlleh, dry sands extend about a quarter of a mile off the mouth of the creek, which latter nearly dries. The Mashlleh is a large salt-water swamp which connects the peninsula on which Bushire stands, to the Great Plain inland. Bashi, on the south-eastern side of Hallleh bay, is a small fishing village with a large round tower and the usual date grove. There are two more small villages in the vicinity, situated further inland, Nargiszar and Dilbar, respectively 3 and 6 miles to the northward. So*uth-east of Hallleh Bay the coast is known as the Tangistan Coast, though it includes the district of Tangistan and Dashtl. In this vicinity, the coastal hills trend towards the sea from behind the Bushire plain which lies to the northward. The strip between the hills and the sea is only 1 or 2 miles wide and contains many small villages surrounded by date groves. This coastal strip continues south-eastward for approximately 50 miles and is backed by a narrow mountain range, the highest peak of which is known as Bu Riyal (Asses Ears) and is 2,680 ft. high. Between this coastal range and the main mountain range, here more than 20 miles inland, is the cultivated Khurmuj Plain drained by the Mund River which enters the sea-about 40 miles south of Hallleh Bay. The villages on this stretch of coast go under the collective name of the BarakI villages. About the centre of the area is Omari, which is marked by a conspicuous square tower. There are two exposed anchorages, one for small vessels in the bay at Bulkhair in 3 fathoms and further south there is an open anchorage off Karri, in a depth of 4 fathoms about 8 cables off shore. Landing can usually be effected at any of the BarakI villages, and there are several small points which afford protection from north-westerly winds. The delta of the Mund river which discharges a large volume of water after the rains, consists of muddy swamps with several small creeks ; one of these Khor Ziyarat, lies about 3 miles south of the main mouth of the Mund and can be entered by boats at high water ; there are depths of 4 ft. on the bar, and 9 ft. in the channel for about 2 miles within .it. Open anchorage may be obtained about 1| miles off the Khor Ziyarat, the entrance to which bears 098° from the mountain Jabal Dirent (3,265 ft.), in a depth of 4 fathoms, mud bottom, whence the depths decrease gradually to the coast.[Part V — continued'] (A) COAST For 8 miles south of Khor Ziyarat a low sandy ridge, which is almost covered at low water, projects considerably from the actual coast. The southern edge of this ridge forms Ras-al-Khan. Anchorage, affording indifferent shelter from the shamal, may be obtained by small craft in a little bay southward of the point, in depths of 2 to 2| fathoms. There is a dry weather road which follows the coast line all the way from Bushire to Bandar Abbas ; and crosses the river Mund, mentioned above, by a pontoon bridge. The road is in very poor condition and is really little more than a track ; after the rains and spring floods it is difficult to follow its course in many places. To the east of Ras-al-Khan the mountains return to the sea (after the gap of the Mund valley) and the coast trends south-east for 12 miles and then turns eastward for 17 miles to Daiyir where the coastline cuts inland across the trend of the coastal mountains and approaches the main ranges. Off the bend formed by this 30 mile stretch of coast, there is a number of small islets and sand banks which should be given a wide berth unless one has a pilot with local knowledge. This area, like numerous other parts of the Gulf, is reported to have changed since the last survey. The last available details are to be found in the Persian Gulf Pilot, page 147. About 12 miles east, towards Daiyir, the hills come right down to the sea and the coast consists of low cliffs and sunken rocks. Nine miles to the westward of Daiyir is a small village called Batuneh, off which there is an exposed anchorage. Seven miles further east there is a rocky point, which projects from the coast (2| miles west of Daiyir), from here to the town, the coast is low with a sandy beach, but divided by-a half-mile wide patch of coral reef, from the beach opposite Daiyir. Daiyir is a small town, in the centre of which is a square fort with two towers, this is surrounded with several trees. The Shaikh’s house, a white two-storeyed building with a small flagstaff, stands near the fort. A remarkable isolated rock of light grey colour, from 60 to 80 ft. in height, stands about 1 mile westward of the town and about f-mile inland ; it has the appearance of a square tower and can be identified at some distance. To the eastward of the town there is a large date grove. Excellent anchorage, affording protection from the shamal, but exposed to the kaus, may be obtained off Daiyir, in a depth of 4 fathoms, with the fort bearing 000°, distant half a mile ; large vessels should anchor further out, in depths of from 8 to 10 fathoms, mud bottom. Landing is difficult unless the boat is able to cross a reef which extends from 1 to 2 cables off shore abreast the town. At springs, the tidal streams attain a rate of from 1 to 2 knots at the anchorage at Daiyir. From Daiyir the coast continues east for about 6 miles to Kangan, and thence runs south-east along the foot of the most south-westerly of the main mountain ranges for nearly 50 miles to Naband Bay. The mountains tower more than 4,800 ft. above the sea, their highest peak reaching 7,000 ft. The coastal plain is in places less than a mile wide, and contains a number of small fishing villages and date groves. Between Daiyir and Kangan the coast is low and sandy ; 7 miles to the east of Daiyir, and 2 miles inland, lies the town of Bardistan ; this is situated near a creek which runs into the sea. In this village, partly hidden by trees, is a tall bad-gir or wind tower. The creek becomes a watercourse during the rains, and drains the valley behind. Kangan, about 8 miles further east, now a small fishing village, was formerly a Portuguese trading port. It stands on a sandy ridge ; there is a tower at its northern end and a large date grove is situated about half a mile north-westward of it. Anchorage may be obtained in 5 fathoms f-mile off shore, shelter is partially found from a north-westward blow (shamal), but it is exposed to the south-west (kaus) wind. Twenty-one miles south-east of Kangan lies Tahiri. This village is situated on the shores of a small bay at the head of which the coastal hills rise to 700 ft. In the village there are two conspicuous white mosques, \\ cables apart, also a large round tower with a white band round it and a flag staff. A partially sheltered anchorage is to be found here with good holding ground, in 6 fathoms, close off shore, with the western point of the bay bearing 284°. Tahiri is on the site of the mediaeval city of Siraf, which was the chief emporium of eastern trade in the 9th and 10th centuries. The ruins extend 2 miles along the shore west of Tahiri and up the slopes of the limestone ridge between the mountains and the sea. Precipitous ravines cross the mountains to fertile plains inland. About 18 miles south-east of Tahiri, continuing along the low sandy shore, lies the village of Asalu, where there is another open anchorage. Asalu is a small pearl fishing' village typical of this coast [see (B) Ports). From Asalu, the coastline enters Naband Bay, the southern arm of which forms Ras Naband, which lies about 5 miles south-south-east of Asalu. The head of the bay is shallow, with depths of 3 fathoms, mud, extending about 2 miles off shore. Gabandi valley extends about 35 miles east-south-eastwards from the head of the bay, between the coastal hills and the mountain range behind them. About 15 miles eastward of the head of the bay there is a bluff, about 3,600 ft. high, which is conspicuous from the entrance to the bay. The southern shorp is low and rocky, and behind it the coastal hills rise to a moderate height, here the shore is low, sandy, and in places swampy. The village of Naband stands on the southern shore about 2\ miles within the point; between the village, which has the usual conspicuous square fort, and the point. There is a reef which extends for about a cable from the shore, and affords shelter for small boats. Ras Naband is faced with a rocky cliff about 10 ft. high, the western side being steep-to with depths increasing to 30 fathoms 3 miles off shore. The tidal streams in this vicinity are very weak.10 (A) COAST [Part V — continued] (4) Ras Naband to Lingeh (Admiralty Charts 2837A, 3599 and 2830) From Naband to Lingeh [see (B) PORTS), a distance of 145 miles, the coast is known as the Shlbkuh coast; it continues the east-south-east trend along and across successive coastal ranges. Where the coast crosses the mouths of the valleys between these ranges, there are wide bays opening south-west, as at Mugam, Charak and Mughu. There are open anchorages in these and in other small bays. The coastal plain continues narrow with small fishing villages about every 10 miles. The dry-weather road follows the coast closely the whole way to Lingeh, from which town only, roads run into the interior. Off this stretch of coast lie the islands of Shaikh-Shu'aib, Hindarabi and Quais. The coast, from Ras Naband to the village of Tibin, which lies 15 miles to the south-east, rises gradually to the summits of white precipitous flat-topped cliffs, from 60 to 80 ft. high, and continues bold, steep-to and rocky. There are several small villages on this stretch, but there is no shelter or anchorage. Tibin is situated in a small bay, and, except for one square hut, is scarcely noticeable from seaward. Close south-eastward of the village is a conspicuous brown slope 380 ft. high, near which there is a small creek, open south-eastward, but not visible from seaward, which affords shelter to dhows. Fifteen miles further south-eastward, passing the villages of Amarieh and Dastur, lies Bustani, also in a small bay, in which there is reasonably good anchorage in 7 fathoms 6 cables off shore. The bottom shallows gradually to 2 fathoms one cable from the beach. A considerable surf runs inshore, but safe landing can be effected at the south-eastern end of the village, by steering for the centre of the latter, and, when clear of the breakers, steering south-eastward parallel with the -coast ; smooth water is obtained inside the reef which extends about 60 yards west-north-westward from the south eastern end of the village. As at Tibin, there is also here a small creek navigable to dhows, it is situated northward of the village, but the entrance is difficult to identify. Between Bustani and Shivuh, 7 miles south-eastward, the coast is indented and in most places cliffy ; from the small sandy bays the hills rise steeply ; there is a number of boat anchorages close inshore, sheltered from the shamal. At Bandar Kalatu, halfway between Bustani and Shivuh there is shelter close inshore about 2^ cables from the point. Shivuh is situated on the eastern point of a small shallow indentation on the coast; in the village is a large square white mosque, and close by to the east, a fort standing near a peaked hill about 250 ft. high. A light is occasionally exhibited from a flagstaff on the Custom House. There is a small boat harbour, with a depth of 1| ft., formed by a flat black rocky ledge, at the south-eastern end of the village. Anchorage may be obtained in 5 fathoms about a quarter of a mile off the black rocky ledge. The cultivated Gabandi valley, which lies behind the coastal range, from Naband approximately to the neighbourhood of Shivuh, is marshy in its lower half and produces flax for the nets used by the numerous fishing villages on this stretch of coast. From Shivuh to Mugam, which lies at the head of Nakhllu bay, 19 miles east-south-east, the coastal range rises steeply to a height of from 200 to 300 ft., and beyond which can be seen the summits of a further range, from 4,000 to 5,000 ft. high, which runs parallel with it, about 12 miles inland. Bandar Basatin, about 4| miles west-north-westward of Mugam, is a small bay, the low point at the western end of which projects from rocky hills. Small vessels may anchor here with the point bearing 270° ; larger vessels should anchor as close inshore as their draught permits, there is a depth of about 10 fathoms at a mile off shore. Mugam, which lies at the head of Nakhllu bay, is a large village, about a quarter of a mile north ward of which is a square fort. A bank, over which there are depths of less than 3 fathoms, extends about 8 cables off shore abreast and north-westward of the village. Anchorage may be obtained, in a depth of 6 fathoms, mud, with the fort bearing 058° distant about 13 cables, or close off the edge of the bank, in a depth of 4 fathoms, with the fort bearing 063° distant about 1 mile. From Mugam the coast trends south for 3| miles to the village of Nakhllu, near a large date grove. There is anchorage off the coast here sheltered from the east wind. Four miles south of the village is Ras Nakhilu. Off the coast at this point, about 6 miles west-south-westward of Ras Nakhilu, lies Jazirat Sheik- Shu’aib. This island, which is 15 miles long by 3 miles wide, has a ridge of hummocks about 120 ft. high running from west to east. The coast has low cliffs and a few sandy bights, and is fringed by reefs. There is a number of small villages and many goats are kept, but owing to the barren nature of the soil there is no cultivation. About 2 miles eastward of the western extremity, on the northern side, there is a small bight which affords good landing. Laz, the principal village stands on a rocky point on the northern coast about 1 mile from its eastern end. Anchorage may be obtained in 4 to 7 fathoms half a mile off shore north-eastward of Laz. Shelter from the shamal can be found in about 8 fathoms, 3 to 5 cables southward of the eastern extremity of the island, but the holding ground is not good. The small islet of Jazirat.Shitvar lies three-quarters of a mile east-south-east of Sheik-Shu’aib ; the channel between has depths of about 2| fathoms and here the tides set strongly, but in the offing they are weak. From Ras Nakhilu, on the mainland, the coast runs east-south-east for 17 miles to Chiru point. There are two small villages about 3 or 4 miles from Ras Nakhilu, but the greater part of the coast on this stretch rises steeply from the shore to the hills behind. About 3| miles to the westward of Chiru Point a bank, over which there are depths of less than 3 fathoms, extends for a mile off shore ; it is marked by discoloured water. Bandar Mansuri is an anchorage used by native craft on this bank, about 2| miles westward of Chiru Point, but it affords indifferent shelter in an easterly wind.[Part V — continued] (A) COAST Off this part of the coast, 4| miles west-south-westward of Chlrii Point lies Jazirat Hindarabi. This reef fringed island is 4| miles long by 2 miles wide. The eastern and western points are low cliffs, and the hills in the centre rise to 100 ft. There is a village in the middle of the northern coast, near which are a few trees and some cultivation. There is an anchorage, exposed to the shamal, off the village in 6 to 8 fathoms, but the holding ground is rocky. The tidal stream is strong northward of the island, but weak in the offing. Chiru Point is low and sfeep-to on its southern and eastern sides. The coast here turns north for a short distance to form a small bay in which is situated the fishing village of Chiru. There is a conspicuous yellow tower, 30 ft. high, which stands on the shore. East of the Chiru village the coast turns due east for 33 miles to Charak. The only anchorages are off two small fishing villages 10 and 15 miles east of Chiru. The first of these, Kalat-al-Abeid has a conspicuous fort on a hill 250 ft. high behind the village. There are several water tanks about a mile to the eastward. Anchorage in 4 fathoms, sand, can be obtained with the western extremity of the land, bearing 260°. Between Kalat-al-Abeid and Gurzeh, 5 miles to the eastward, the coast is fringed for 3 miles by a flat, which extends about half a mile off shore. Gurzeh is situated on the northern shore of a small bay, and anchorage may be obtained, with shelter from the shamal, close off shore. Thirteen miles east is a small point, Ras Tavuneh, on which the village of the same name stands, this has the usual date grove, and also four conspicuous towers and a castle. There is an anchorage close inshore, south-eastward of the point. The town of Charak, at which point the territory known as the Shibkuh coast ends, lies 5 miles east-north-east of Ras Tavuneh. To be included with this stretch of coast is Jazirat Qais. This island, on which is one of the navigational aids in the gulf, lies 9 miles due south of the village of Gurzeh. Qais is miles long and 4^ miles wide. The coasts of the island are low and consist of sandy beaches between rocky points ; there is a fringe of reefs, in places up to a mile distant, surrounding the shores. The eastern and western extremities are low cliffs. There are many trees on the island and several villages on its northern side with some cultivation. The central plateau, 120 ft. high, is grazed by sheep and goats. Water is obtainable along the shore by digging, and there are several rain water cisterns. Safil, a small village, is situated about three-quarters of a mile south-westward of the northern point of the island ; this point consists of low cliffs about 15 ft. high. Landing off this and other villages is bad at low water owing to the many off-lying reefs. Masheh, another village on the northern coast, extends about a mile along the shore of the bay of the same name, southward of the north eastern point of the island. The best anchorage is off the northern part of Masheh village, to the eastward of the point, in 8 to 9 fathoms, mud, with a fort on the point bearing between 283° and 294°. This gives shelter from the shamal. The tidal streams between Qais and the mainland are reported strong and irregular. A light, maintained by the Persian Gulf Light Service, is exhibited, at an elevation of 89 ft., from a white steel structure, 33 ft. in height, situated on the southern side of the island in position Lat. 26° 31' N., Long. 53° 59' E. Qais was the successor of Siraf (modern town, now Tahir!), and predecessor of Hormuz, as chief emporium of eastern trade from about the 11th to the 13th century; ruins of the old mediaeval, walled city extend half a mile along the northern shore. Charak, on the mainland, is a small walled fishing town standing at the head of the bay of the same name. The town has a date grove behind it, and on a hillock, 90 ft. high, standing half a mile inland, are the ruins of a small fort. The Shaikh’s house stands in the middle of the town, where there is also a Custom House. Sheep, cattle, and goats may be obtained in the vicinity. There is a small creek, in which boats are hauled up, with the mouth about 1 mile eastward of the Shaikh’s house. Good anchorage may be found off the town, in 4 fathoms, mud, with Ras Tavuneh bearing 267°. Landing at low water is bad, for the sandy beach in front of the town dries off in ridges for about 2 cables. East of Charak the coast curves south-east, forming Charak Bay ; it crosses the mouth of a wide salt-marsh which stretches east for 35 miles behind the coastal hills, and is fringed inland by villages and date palms ; the centre is passable by animals in summer, but only by boat in winter. Charak Bay is separated from Mughu Bay, about 10 miles to the south-eastward, by Ras Yurd, a low broad point north of which is a volcanic hill 1,080 ft. high. Mughu Bay, which is about 13 miles across, from Ras Yurd to Ras Bustaneh, is formed by a shallow curve in the coast, its shores are low and sandy, but the land rises gently to the hills at each point of the bay. Mughu village stands on the north-west shore of the bay ; there is a date grove in the vicinity and a fort with towers in the village. There is anchorage off the village, in 4 fathoms, clay, about a mile off shore, but little shelter is to be had from the shamal, which here blows from the westward. Ras Bustaneh, the southern point of Mughu Bay, rises north-east to Jabal Bustaneh, a group of irregular volcanic hills with two peaks, 1,800 and 1,750 ft. high.12 (A) COAST [Part V — continued] Between Ras Bustaneh and Ras-ash-Shias, 11 miles east, is another wide sandy bay ; it is fronted by a rocky beach. There is anchorage off the village of Bustaneh, 2 miles north-eastward of Ras Bustaneh, but with no shelter from the shamal. Good landing can be effected on the sandy beach 2| miles westward of Ras-ash-Shias. x Ras-ash-Shias is a low sandy point with Shias Bay, which is about 3 miles across, immediately to the eastward. There is good anchorage in Shias Bay, south-east of the village of the same name, in from 5 to 7 fathoms, and sheltered from the shamal. The village is obscured from seaward by a thick date grove. Ras Kharyu, which forms the eastern arm of Shias Bay, is also a low sandy point, but has a rocky beach ; a spit over which there is a depth of 9 ft., extends from the point, 4| cables to the south-eastward. The tidal streams off Ras-ash-Shias and Ras Kharyu attain a speed of 1^ knots and cause discolouration to the water. From Ras Kharyu the coast trends north-eastward to the, point of Lingeh, which is about 4 miles distant. Jazirat Farur lies off the coast in this section, about 12^ miles south-south-west ward of Ras Bustaneh. This island, which is about 4| miles from north to south, and 3 miles from east to west, rises, with dark coloured volcanic hills, to a table-topped peak, 476 ft. high and is surmounted by a cairn. The coastline is mainly rocky and steep-to, backed by cliffs, and with occasional sandy bays. The island is inhabited and contains two small villages ; off one of these, on the eastern coast, there is anchorage in 27 fathoms, 2f cables off shore, with the village bearing 240°. (5) Lingeh to Jask (Admiralty Chart 753) From Lingeh the coast continues its north-east trend for 96 miles to the port of Bandar Abbas, it crosses the seaward end of several unsurveyed mountain ranges and of the valleys between them. The large island of Qishm is separated from the mainland, between Lingeh and Bandar Abbas, by Clarence Strait. The smaller islands of Henjam and Larak lie off Qishm Island, and Hormuz lies off the mainland coast east of Bandar Abbas. Inland from Lingeh hills rise to 400 ft., and beyond them is the large salt-marsh which extends from Charak, about 35 miles to the westward. North of the salt-marsh are Lingeh Mountains, in which Lingeh Peak rises to 3,900 ft. at a distance of 22 miles north-north-west of the town. From the outskirts of Lingeh the sandy coast slopes up to an irregular group of hills whose highest point (1,020 ft.) is 3 miles inland, and about 10 miles north-east of the town. Four miles north-east of Lingeh is the small town of Kung ; it extends about % mile along the sandy coast, and contains many well-built houses and several gilded mosques. At the south-western end of the town are the ruins of an old Portuguese factory, near which, on the beach, is a large fort. There is a large date grove west of the town. Landing is bad at low water, as the sandy beach dries off in ridges for a distance of about 2| cables, with depths of only 1 or 2 ft. between the ridges. Anchorage may be obtained, in a depth of 5 fathoms, mud, abreast the town, about 1J miles off shore. About 50 ocean-going dhows are based on Kung, these trade regularly with Khorramshahr {see (B) PORTS) and also make one trip a year to Aden and East Africa. There is a sand bank, with depths of under three fathoms, about \\ miles off shore, which fringes the coast from 2\ miles south-west of Kung to Ras-ash-Shavari, which lies 7 miles north-east of Kung. Ras-ash-Shavari, 7 miles north-east of Kung, is a low rounded headland, which forms the south western point of a small bight called Bandar Hamairan. The village of Bandar Mu’Allim stands in a date grove, on the shores of the bight, about 1 mile northward of Ras-ash-Shavari. There is a shoal with 10 ft. depth near the head of the bight about If miles off shore ; inside this, native craft anchor in 4 fathoms. From Bandar Hamairan, for 17 miles, the coast crosses the end of two ridges of the Lingeh Mountains, in the angle between which are sulphur springs. North-east of these mountains the coast forms the north-west shore of Clarence Strait which lies between Qishm Island and the mainland. Clarence Strait is about 65 miles long, and in the middle is constricted to a width of 1| miles by Laft Point, which projects from the north-west coast of Qishm Island. South-west of Laft Point the strait contains many mud islets covered with dense mangrove thickets. A large islet divides the navigable channel into two ; the north-western is wider but is almost silted up ; the south-eastern is deeper but narrow and difficult. The mainland on the northern side of the channel, for about the first 16 miles, is formed by the delta of the Run-i-Mehran, an unexplored salt valley whose mouth is a wide mangrove swamp. Khamir Village, near a creek at the north-east end of the swamp, exports sulphur and millstones to Bandar Abbas. There is anchorage in 3| fathoms, about \ mile off shore, south-eastward of the village. The east part of the Clarence Strait has a very intricate channel, with banks and shoals, but it is navigable by moderate sized vessels. The Rud-i-Kul is a river which runs into the strait from the mainland, to the north-east of Laft Point. Between Rud-i-Kul and Bandar Abbas, a distance of 31 miles, the coast is a bare sandy plain, and contains irregular hills and several villages.[Part V — continued] (A) COAST The village of Bustaneh lies 18 miles west of Bandar Abbas. There are numerous sand and mud banks off the shore until Bandar Abbas is reached. Between Bustaneh Village and the bank to the east there is a well sheltered anchorage, with good holding ground, in depths of from 4| to 7 fathoms, but in the eastward approach to the anchorage the depths are from 3| to 4^ fathoms. There is a small village, Suru, situated 2 miles west-south-westward of Bandar Abbas pier. (For details of Bandar Abbas, see (B) PORTS.) Qishm Island, lies between Lingeh and Bandar Abbas, off the coast of the mainland, from which it is separated by Clarence Strait. The island is 67 miles long from north-east to south-west, and contains irregular flat-topped hills, with several peaks over 900 ft. high ; the highest peak is 1,330 ft. and is situated 18 miles from the south-west end. Ras Khargu and Laft Point project from the middle of the south-east and north-west coasts respectively. The south-east and west coasts have sandy bays, backed by irregular hills ; the north-west coast which forms the south-east shore of the Clarence Strait, is flat and fringed by tidal mud flats. The island is mostly barren and in parts encrusted with salt, but some cereals, vegetables, melons and dates are grown on the fertile black loam in the north. There is much game on the island ; wild goats, partridges and rock pigeons abound in the hills, and in the plains many small antelopes or gazelles. Salt is mined on the south-east coast, and there are also naptha springs. From May to October the climate is extremely trying. The small town of Qishm lies on the shore at the north-eastern end of the island. The shores of the bight south-westward of the hill behind Qishm Town, are low and sandy, but, farther south-westward, as far as Ras Khargu, the coast is a succession of rocky patches between which are small sandy beaches. This coast is open to the shamal, which in this locality blows from between south-west and west-south-west. The only town of any size, in addition to Qishm, is Basidu ; this is situated on the western end of the island facing the entrance to Clarence Strait; the town is now in a state of decay and has a dilapidated stone pier, the head of which is awash. There is anchorage off Basidu* protected by Beacon Shoal, in 7 to 5 fathoms good clay holding ground. There are numerous small villages in the fertile north part round the coast. Henjam Island, lies off Qishm Island ; it is separated from Ras Khargu by Henjam Sound, 1 mile wide. (For details of Henjam, see (B) PORTS.) Larak is a barren island 6 miles south-east of Qishm Town. It is 6^ miles long and 4| miles wide, is covered with stunted vegetation and has rugged hills rising to 510 ft. ; it is surrounded by a reef and the coasts are steep-to. There is a fishing village on the north coast with exposed anchorage off it, and the ruins of a Dutch fort nearby. There are some rainwater cisterns, but water is scarce. There is a low sandy point on the northern side, two miles eastward of which is a small village. Anchorage, with shelter from the Shamal only, may be obtained in 13 fathoms, between the village and the point about 3 cables off shore. Hormuz Island lies about 11 miles south-east of Bandar Abbas. The island is about 5^ miles long by 4-| miles wide. It contains barren salt hills about 300 ft. high, which are encrusted with many different coloured minerals, and has a few white peaks rising about 700 ft. in the centre. The hills fall steeply to the sea except in the north, where there is a low point, and shelly plain, about 1 mile wide. There is sheltered anchorage off the north side of the island, with the ruins of a Portuguese fort bearing about 236°, distant half a mile, in depths of from 7 to 8 fathoms, mud ; small vessels anchor near the fishing village of Hormuz, which is a collection of mud huts, southward of the fort. The eastern and south-eastern side of the islands are fringed with reefs to a distance of from 2 to 6 cables off shore. Red iron oxide is mined by the Persian Government: more than 7,000 tons were shipped to Britain in 1936, out of 13,000 tons exported. The city of Hormuz was founded at the beginning of the fourteenth century when the entire population of old Hormuz emigrated from the mainland. For two centuries it was the chief emporium of eastern trade and the centre of an empire, though all its water and supplies had to be imported. The city gradually declined and its ruins cover the north coastal plain. The small fishing village is now the only settlement. From Bandar Abbas to the Minab River, which lies 40 miles east-south-east, the coast is low and swampy, with many mangroves to the east. It is fringed by tidal mudflats. Inland there are high mountains which lie about 30 miles north-eastwards, the highest peak Kuh-i-Ginau (7,690) being particularly conspicuous. This range runs in a large semi-circle, following the curve of the coast towards the entrance to the gulf of Oman. The salt Shur river and the Rud-i-Jamugh enter the sea along this stretch of coast. The road from Bandar Abbas to Minab keeps about 15 miles inland, but there is a track, passable only in dry weather about 5 miles from the coast. The Minab River irrigates a fertile cultivated district, with date groves and orchards, to which many people from Bandar Abbas migrate for the summer. Khor Minab, a salt creek 7 miles north-west of the river, is used by native craft trading in grain and fruit, and has tracks to Minab at its head.14 (A) COAST [Part V — continued] Nearby are the ruins of Old Hormuz, which was abandoned when the inhabitants moved to the island of Hormuz. The town of Minab is situated about 13 miles north-eastward of the mouth of the Minab river. The town is only a collection of mud huts. The district produces dates, plantains, mangroves, wheat, henna, etc. Five and a half miles south-south-eastward of the Minab river, is the mouth of the Mazavi river. In ordinary times very little of the water in this river flows into the sea as it is diverted by irrigation canals. Close to the south of the Mazavi river stands the village of Khargun. This may be identified by a turtle-backed hillock and some date trees ; the land in the vicinity is low and sandy. About 10 miles south-south-eastward of Khargun is Kuhistak, another small coastal village. Here the mangrove swamps and creeks end and the hills approach the sea from behind the coastal plain. There is a fort from 80 to 100 ft. high in the village of Kuhistak, which makes it easily recognisable. From Kuhistak the coast runs, with only slight indentation, for 20 miles south-south-east to Bandar Sirik. The coastal range is from 2 to 3 miles inland, and on the immediate coast are sand hills from 30 to 40 ft. high, with occasional gaps. There are several small villages at intervals, mostly identified by date groves. Bandar Sirik, a small backwater used by dhows, is situated near a sandy point, about 5 miles northward of the mouth of the Gaz river. Landing may be effected about J-mile northward of Bandar Sirik. The Gaz river has no marks to identify its mouth from seaward, but it appears to be deep enough for coastal craft to enter. From the Gaz river the coast trends south-east for over 40 miles to Ras-al-Kuh. Kunari point, 13 miles south of the Gaz river, is very low and partly covered at high water. The Kunari river is 6 miles north of the point, and is navigable by small boats for 3| miles, with a depth of 4 ft. over the bar and 14 ft. inside ; the banks are low and covered with mangroves. There is a shoal, over which is a depth of 4 fathoms, about 2j miles south-west of Kunari point. Between Kunari point and Ras-ash-Shir, a distance of 12 miles, there are patches of mangroves. This latter point and the coast to the northward of it should be given a wide berth, the §hoal here extends 3 miles off shore. From Ras-ash-Shir the coast trends south-south-east in a shallow curve, for about 15 miles ; approximately half-way stands the Proserpine rock. This is a wedged shaped rock, about 70 ft. high, standing close off shore. There is a tower on the coast 1J miles northward of the rock, near which is a small creek with depths of 2 to 4 ft. Three and a quarter miles north of Ras-al-Kuh, in a swampy plain, 1 mile inland, stands Kuh-i-Mubarak, a very remarkable isolated rock ; it is light in colour, 333 ft. high and has a hole in the upper eastern corner, open from north-westwards and south-eastward. Ras-al-Kuh is a low point, with a bank |-mile off shore, this has depths of less than 3 fathoms over it, and the edge is steep-to. The coast is sandy with tufts of grass ; a creek used by native craft, enters the sea close north-westward of the point. About 3 miles to the north-east of the point is the small village of Mugmalam. Anchorage may be obtained, in 6 to 10 fathoms f-mile off shore about 1 mile south-eastward of Ras-al-Kuh. Cape Jask, lies across the bay of the same name, 25 miles to the east-south-eastward of Ras-al-Kuh. The intervening coast is low with a belt of mangrove trees connected by creeks with the low sandy shore. The coastal bank, extends 1| miles off shore, and has depths of under 3 fathoms. Gahha shoal, a small 1| fathom patch of soft mud, steep-to, lies 3 miles off shore, 10 miles east- south-eastward of Ras-al-Kuh. % Several prominent mountains are visible from seaward, long before shore is sighted. (For details of Jask see (B) PORTS.) (6) Jask to the Baluchistan Frontier (Admiralty Chart 38) From Jask the general trend of the coast line is east-south-east for about 200 miles to the Baluchistan frontier which joins the sea in Gwatar Bay. Jask East bay lies to the eastward of Jask point and extends to Ras Jagin about 20 miles east- south-east. The hills approach the coast at the head of the bay, ending in white cliffs 1,720 ft. high and which terminate about 1 mile from the shore. The north-west shore of the bay is rocky and level, about 14 ft. high, with a sandy beach, rocky ledges and low cliffs. The north-eastern shore is low and sandy and fringed by a sandbank which dries out to a distance of ^ mile. Anchorage may be found, sheltered from west winds, in 6 to 8 fathoms, close off the north-west shore, but the bay is open to easterly and north-easterly winds. There is a small village with date palms on the north-eastern coast, and 8 miles north-west of Ras Jagln is the entrance to a stream. Ras Jagin, which has a sand spit extending ^ mile south-westward of it is low and sandy, and the Jagin river flows out close to the eastward. Inland of the point is a mangrove swamp from which a plain extends to the hills behind. From Ras Jagln to Sadaich point which lies 31 miles almost due east, the coast is low with mangrove swamps intersected by many creeks. Thirteen miles east of Ras Jagln one of the largestPart V — continued] , • (A) COAST [ of these rivers enters the sea, this and several others are capable of being entered by local craft. Six miles westward of Sadaich point a range of bare white sand-hills, about 100 ft. high, runs along the coast as far as the point. On the westward end of this range there is a conspicuous tree. About 36 miles north-north-westward of Sadaich point there is a prominent peak, Guh Kuh (Jabal Shahu), 6,220 ft. high. The Sadaich river flows through swampy ground into a tidal creek just eastward of the point, and is fronted by a shallow bay. Boats cannot enter at low water, and it is shallow within. On the banks, some distance inland are a village and some date groves. About 27 miles along the coast south-eastward of Sadaich point lies Ras Maidani. This bluff point is faced with white cliffs, about 155 ft. high, which commence about 3 miles to the westward of the point. Nine miles east of Sadaich, protected by a rocky point, is a small bay which affords good landing. There is a sand bank about 2 miles off shore running the length of this stretch of coast, this bank continues at times 3 miles off, as far as Ras Maidani. From northward of the hills which terminate in the white cliffs mentioned above, near Ras Maidani, the great coastal plain continues westward for about 60 miles. The next headland, east of Ras Maidani, 27 miles distant, is Ras Maki. The coast between these two points is low and sandy and intersected by creeks ; there are depths of less than 3 fathoms within 1^ miles of the coast. About 8 miles east of Ras Maidani is the Khor Rabch, this is the mouth of a large tidal backwater encumbered with flats of mud and sand. There is a bar, 1^ miles off the entrance with depths of from 1£ to 6 ft. (last survey made in 1911). Over the bar, in the channel are depths of 1| to 6 fathoms. The surrounding country is mostly desert, but there are several villages and date groves inland. The Khor is only used by fishing craft. There is an anchorage in 4^ fathoms, sand, about miles south ward of the entrance, which is between two low sandy points. Eight miles to the eastward is the Khor Galag, the mouth of Rapch river. The coast here is also bare and low, but the entrance to this Khor is conspicuous by the presence of some tall palms close to the eastward. The Khor is shallow and little used ; there is always a surf on the bar. Up the stream is a small village. Khor Darak (Doruk) is entered 6 miles further eastward ; anchorage may be found in 2| fathoms, |-mile off the entrance. Biri Sai Padag, a sharp double peak, 1,680 ft. high is situated about 8^ miles north-eastward of Ras Maki; this peak is part of Kuh Kalai, a great range of white clay cliffs. From Ras Maki which is 100 ft. high, the coast trends east-south-east in a shallow curve to Ras Tank, a rocky promontory 17 miles distant. For the first 14 miles the coast is low and there is the village of Hamadan, situated in a date grove on the banks of a small creek about 3J miles eastward of Ras Maki. Within 3 miles of Ras Tank the coast becomes cliffy. Ras Tank is a rocky “ T ” shaped promontory surmounted by some sand-hills, it extends about 1 mile from the coast, to which it is joined by a narrow sandy isthmus. There is a small group of brown hills making a good mark, about 4 miles north-eastward of the point. There are depths of 7 fathoms ^-mile southward of the point, but there is a shoal with only 4 fathoms 1 mile eastward of the promontory. Anchorage may be found in about 3| fathoms, with the eastern end of Ras Tank bearing 197° distant about 5 cables, the holding ground however is rocky and bad. Tank village lies 3 miles up a large creek which is entered over a shallow bar between the coast and a drying sand spit, marked by breakers when covered, and lying close eastward of the root of Ras Tank isthmus. Dhows drawing 5 ft. can enter the creek at high water. The outgoing stream in the creek attains a rate of 2 to 3 knots. About 10 miles eastward of Ras Tank is *Ras Rashidi; this is the eastern extremity of a table topped promontory, about 150 ft. high, the southern side of which trends westward for about 5| miles and ends in a somewhat high vertical cliff. The promontory is almost inaccessable on all sides, and the land on its northern side is low and sandy ; there are depths of 4 fathoms about half a mile off its southern side. Eastward of Ras Rashidi lies Puzim bay, this is 5 miles across, the eastern arm being formed by Ras Puzim. The shores of the bay are low and sandy, there are a few huts on the western side, and the small fishing village of Puzim lies in the eastern side close northward of the point. There is a sheltered anchorage off Puzim village, in 4 fathoms, or on the western side of the bay. Ras Puzim is faced with cliffs 300 ft. high, there are depths of 3 fathoms within about 1 mile of the point, outside which the depth increases to 6 and 8 fathoms. Eleven miles east-south-east of Ras Puzim is Ras Kuhlab, the coast between is high, and may safely be approached to within about 1 mile. Ras Kuhlab is the extremity of a promontory, the sides of which consist of low cliffs ; this point forms the western arm of Chahbar bay ; the eastern point, 7| miles distant is Chahbar point. For the first 4 miles within the entrance points of Chahbar bay, the shores on both sides of the bay are rocky ; at the head of the bay is a large plain, the shores of which are low and swampy. Namak river flows in the bay 6 miles north of Tiz point.16 (A) COAST ’ \Part V — continued] Five and three-quarter miles north of Ras Kuhlab is Kunarak village with a conspicuous tree close to the southward. A range of mountains runs parallel with the head of the bay to the north of the coastal plain. Tlz point lies 3| miles to the northward of Chahbar point and the intervening coast forms a small bay, at the head of which is Chahbar town (for details see (B) PORTS). From Chahbar point the coast runs in a straight line east-south-east for about 30 miles to Ras Bris. Kinj Dap is a gap in the coastal hills, 13 miles east of Chahbar through which a small stream of the same name flows, the mouth is probably usually barred with sand, but after heavy rains in the interior it becomes open; at its mouth is a grove of acacia trees and on the eastern bank, about miles from the sea, is the village of Kinj. On the eastern side of the Kinj Dap, situated close to the coast with cliffs on the seaward side, is Siah Kuh ; this hill is about 1,000 ft. high, dark and round. The coast line from Chahbar point as far as Kinj Dap consists of rocky hills and cliffs, gradually rising from west to east. From Siah Kuh to Ras Bris, about 18 miles, the coast is low and sandy ; there are depths of about 5 fathoms 1£ miles off shore. There is a large village on the coast 1^ miles east of Siah Kuh, and Kochu is a small settlement 12 miles west of Bris. Ras Bris is a point on the southern side of a small base ; the village of Bris is 1| miles north eastward of the point. Anchorage may be obtained in 5 fathoms, sand, in the middle of the bay. Eastward of Ras Bris the coast runs east-south-east for 15 miles to Ras Fasta. The first 7 miles of this stretch consists of white vertical cliffs about 200 ft. high ; where these cliffs terminate there is a low gap, 2 miles in extent, when the coast recedes for a short distance. At the eastern end of this gap, the cliffs again commence, to continue to Ras Fasta. Ras Fasta is the western area of Gwatar bay, where the Persian territory joins Baluchistan, and is the termination of Persian Makran. The whole of the preceding stretch of coast from Jask to Gwatar, a distance of 210 miles, is frequently obscured by dust haze which makes navigation difficult, especially between April and July. In places the coast is very low, with the mountain ranges some distance inland, but there are many high rocky points and hills near the coast. The country, though barren, is not absolutely desert. There is a number of small settlements, as described, but no towns of any importance, and the population is scanty.[Part V — ■continued] (B) PORTS (C58272) ‘ c THE PERSIAN GULF (B) PORTS ABADAN (Lat. 30° 20' N„ Long. 48’ 16' E.) (See Plans 2 and 2 (a) and Admiralty Chart 3844.) (a) THE PORT (1) General Abadan is situated on the island of the same name, which is about 30 miles up the Shatt-al-Arab river at the head of the Persian Gulf. It is on the north-eastern bank of the river about 8 miles south- eastwards of Khorramshahr with Bawarda about one mile below it. On this island is situated the oil refinery of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (A.I.O.C.). The oil is brought by pipe lines to the refinery from the oil fields of Masjid-i-Sulaiman and Haftkel, about 70-80 miles to the north-north-east. The original concession was obtained in 1901 on a site which was nothing more than a mud flat, but which is now as modern in many respects as an English industrial town. It is the A.I.O.C.’s export port and the greatest oil port of the East. From the Rooka Channel at the mouth of the Shatt-al-Arab (for general description of approaches see Persian Gulf Pilot), where the pilot is embarked, the river winds through 30 miles of flat country to Abadan, the banks are lined with extensive date gardens, and there is a continual traffic of trading and fishing dhows. The boundary between Persia and Iraq is the low water mark on the Persian or north-eastern bank of the Shatt-al-Arab river, except from just below Abadan to above Khorramshahr, In this section the boundary runs down the centre of the river. There is an airport 1^ miles north-west of the town. Before the war (1939-45) this was a landing ground normally used only by the A.I.O.C. It has now been considerably expanded and has three all-weather runways, control tower, workshops and several hangars. It was used during the war for assembly of “ Aid to Russia ” planes which were then flown to Tehran. Flying boats could alight on the river. The river is 1,400 ft. wide opposite No. 7 jetty. At Khosrowabad which is on the left bank of the river, 17 miles below Abadan, there is a new oil delivery point with adjacent tank farms. This is connected by road with Abadan. (2) Conspicuous objects The large buildings and tall chimneys of the refinery are visible from seaward. The oil storage tanks at Bawarda on the starboard hand are the sign of approaching Abadan. (3) Tides, tidal streams and currents There is a mean rise of tide of 6 ft. with a maximum rise of 10 ft. The in-going tidal stream attains a rate of 1^ knots and the out-going stream 3 knots. Heavy flooding of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, which is frequent during the late spring, may increase the rate of the outgoing stream to 5 knots. (4) Weather The port of Abadan is little affected by weather. Occasional bad dust storms, which affect the visibility, may slow up navigation in the river and affect the berthing arrangements. Should spring flood-water or high wind make berthing difficult there are always tugs available. (5) Anchorages All ships may anchor at the seaward end of the Rooka channel, either to await the tide or embark the pilot. The pilot service is controlled by the Basra Port Directorate, who maintain the dredged channel at Rooka. Other anchorages in the river below Abadan are :— (i) Kasba Reach, where there is ample space for large vessels with 1,000 ft. swinging room. (ii) Chellabi, emergency anchorage for two vessels. (iii) Kabda, anchorage for two vessels in an emergency. (iv) Bawarda—easily recognisable by the oil storage tanks—anchorage’ for four large vessels with a maximum draught of 26 ft. (6) Description of Harbour The harbour of Abadan lies along the eastern bank of the Shatt-al-Arab. It extends from the “ slow ” notice-board on the right bank of the river above Zayadiya (Zayadi Creek), to the “ slow ” notice-boards on the right bank of the river above Seeba. There are 27 jetties (see Appendix “ A ”) all of which are fitted with electric light and hydrants. They can be used at all times except in a very strong wind ; the majority are purely oiling berths. There are two main unloading wharves, the(B) PORTS [Part V—continued] south-eastern wharf alongside the Breim Creek at the north-western end of the town, and the Central Stores Wharf on the southern bank of the dredged creek on the east side of Abadan village. On the south-western side of the river between Abadan and Bawarda, there are a number of mooring buoys. All sea-going vessels whether awaiting a berth or loaded and waiting for the tide, must be moored below the lowest jetty at Bawarda, and no vessel bound for Abadan or Bawarda may ascend the river above that point until boarded by the Harbour Master. The port area and entrance to the jetties is all enclosed by a high fence with gates, and access was readily controlled during the war by a system of passes and sentries. (7) Quayage, Cranage, and Clearance from Quays For full details of jetties see Appendix “ A ” with reference to plan. Each of the main jetties has a local number which is prominently displayed. All jetties are in a good state of repair and electric light and water facilities are maintained by the A.I.O.C. Any of the jetties are liable to be silted up and temporarily put out of action. In addition to the jetties in Appendix “ A ” the following main wharves are available :— Breim Creek which is 1,750 ft. long and 6 ft. deep in the centre. There are berths for seven barges on its 1,500-ft. long steel-piled north bank. Cranes available are :— One 5-ton portal electric crane. One 3-ton portal electric crane. One 3-ton rail crane, 3-ft. gauge. One 15-ton rail crane. One 80-ton Butters Hoist. One 15-ton steam crane on the south-east wharf. Clearance by road to the town or airfield. Central Stores Creek. —Situated on the east side of Abadan village. The creek is 2,800 ft. long and 6 ft. deep in the centre. There are berths for eight barges on the south bank. Cranes available are :— One 2-ton electric jib-crane. One 5-ton electric jib-crane. Khosrowabad. —The oil delivery point 17 miles downstream from Abadan has three jetties for fuelling, the details, identical for all three, are as follows :—- (а) Length, 150 ft. (б) Width 10 ft. with T-head 70 ft. by 30 ft. (c) Height of deck above H.W., 5.ft. (d) Wharves are the same height as the bank. (e) A 500-ft. vessel can be accommodated at each. (/) Steel and wood construction. (g) Depth of water alongside at M.L.W. 32 ft. Other Cranage There is a floating crane the Akvan, normally moored just above No. 4 jetty, particulars as follows :— Maximum Lift [Main Block). —200 tons at 16 ft. overhang. Range of lift—from 10 ft. below W.L. to 52 ft. above W.L. Loads may be deposited on the front of the pontoon 11 ft. in from the edge. Lift with Aux. Block.—Q0 tons at 36 ft. overhang. Range of lift—from 10 ft. below W.L. to 90 ft. above W.L. Draught of Pontoon — (Unloaded)—crane end 3 ft., ballast end 7 ft. 9 in.

At Abadan there are five anchoring berths lettered “A” to “ E,” the limit of each berth is marked by transit beacons on the right bank of the river. Three ocean-going steamers can be berthed at No. 4 jetty at one time, and unloaded on the inner side to the jetty, and the outer side into barges, which when loaded can be towed to the Breim Creek wharf. Twelve ocean-going ships can be accommodated at the oiling jetties at Abadan at one time and three at Khosrowabad. (9) Harbour Craft For full details see Apendix “ B,” but this list is liable to variation. (10) Landing of Men, Stores and Vehicles by Water Transport No. 4 jetty (No. 7 on Plan) is the only jetty suitable for disembarkation of animals and motor transport. The majority of the oil jetties could be used for personnel, but those handling “ light ” oil are naturally dangerous. Vehicles and stores could also be disembarked from barges at Breim Creek and Central Stores Creek. (11) Warehouses and Stacking Space Storage capacity at Abadan proper is 50,000 sq. ft., in ten buildings, one of which is 5,000 sq. ft. capacity and has a 4-ton crane. Another building of the same capacity has a l|-ton crane - At Breim Creek there are nine storage buildings with 13,500 sq. ft. capacity. One building of 400 sq. ft. has a 3-ton crane. At Bawarda there is 30,000 sq. ft. of storage space in eight buildings. One building of 5,000 sq. ft. has a 5-ton crane. Cold Storage There is a large cold storage consisting of eight chambers with a total capacity of approximately 40,000 cu. ft. » There are also two cold storage chambers (total capacity 8,600 cu. ft.) used for storing ice, each chamber being capable of holding 45 tons of ice. The maximum capacity of the ice-making machine is 50 tons in 24 hours. (12) Coal, Oil and Water [а) Coal. —There is a small stock of coal kept for the use of the A.I.O.C. only. (б) Oil. —The Admiralty have a contract for the supply of oil fuel and unlimited stocks are available with facilities for supplying ships by pipe line at jetties. Furnace oil can be loaded at 600 tons per hour and lighter oils at 400 tons per hour. There are 12 oiling jetties at Abadan and three at Khosrowabad. Fuel can also be taken from barges. (c) Water. —Water is supplied to ships from hydrants on the majority of the jetties and is drawn from the town drinking water supply. There is a barge holding 68 tons of drinking water and 97 tons of boiler water in separate tanks. It is, however, more convenient for boiler water to be taken at Fao. (13) Docks, Slipways and Repair Facilities Floating Dock One floating dock is moored in the river opposite No. 6 jetty, details :— Length over pontoon, 172 ft. 11 in. Width between fenders, 44 ft. 6 in. Draught over keel blocks, 12 ft. 0 in. Lifting power, 750 tons. The plant allows minor repairs to small vessels. Slipways , Two slipways for barge building and repairs to motor boats are situated near No. 6 jetty. These are capable of taking 110 ft. M.L.s. Workshops There is a well-equipped main workshop. Castings can be made up to 2| tons. 10-cwt. steam and pneumatic hammers are available for forging. It is fitted with electric and acetylene welding equip ment, a planing machine which will take 3 ft. wide, 3 ft. high and 10 ft. long, also several lathes, the largest of which has a 27 in. centre and will admit up to 26 in. gap open and closed.(B) PORTS [Part V — continued] There is a punching machine and rolling machine for plate lengths up to 9 ft. long. There are several portable cranes up to 12 tons capacity. There is a well-equipped electrical workshop and battery charging station which has a fully qualified staff of three Europeans and a number of Iranian and Indian mechanics. The charging station handles approximately 2,000 accumulators a month. This workshop can undertake the repair of all signal equipment. (14) Facilities for Clearing Port Area [a] Roads .—Abadan is connected with Khorramshahr by a metalled all-weather road and thence by the same type of road to Ahwaz, crossing the Karun river by vehicle ferry or floating bridge at Khorramshahr There are first class roads from all jetties and over the entire refinery area. (b) Railways .—There is 60 miles of 3 ft. gauge railway in Abadan, with an extension to the airfield. Rolling stock includes 15 fireless steam engines for the refinery, 13 diesel engines, two oil-fired and four petrol motor engines The following flat wagons and box cars are available :— Flat Wagons. Box Cars. No. Capacity. No. Capacity. 2 780 tons. 8 20 tons (400 cu. ft.). 2 30 tons. 31 15 tons (300 cu. ft.). 233 . 20 tons. 20 7 tons (200 cu. ft.). 9 10 tons. 113 7 tons (150 cu. ft.). 68 7 tons. 56 2 tons (54 cu. ft.). 29 | ton. 16 £ ton (25 cu. ft.). In addition to the foregoing there are 60 special service wagons. In the reception yard are one 5-ton, one 3-ton portal, two 3-ton cranes and one 2-ton truck crane. A 35 mile 2 ft. 6 in. gauge railway transports goods from Dar-i-Khazineh, on the upper Karun river to the oil field area at Masjid-i-Sulaiman. Five diesel locomotives and 114 wagons with an average capacity of 15 tons are used. The railhead at Khorramshahr is now connected with the main trans-Iranian railway at Ahwaz. (c) River .—From Abadan, Basra or Khorramshahr the most reliable all-weather route to the oil field area is by river craft, although the roads and railways were much improved during the war (1941-45) to facilitate “ Aid-to-Russia ” traffic. It is necessary for goods going up the Karun by river craft to be transhipped at Ahwaz owing to the rapids. Dar-i-Khazineh is the river head, and the light railway and road to the oil fields start from there. (15) Normal Functions of Port In peacetime Abadan functions entirely as an oil exporting port, and the only imports are machinery for the refinery, and food stuffs for both the European and native population. The output of the refinery has been considerably expanded during the war period. In February, 1945, 52 tankers loaded cargoes at the port ; this is approximately the monthly average. (16) Estimated Daily Capacity During the year 1944, when cargoes had reached the peak for “ Aid-to-Russia,” 253,000 tons were unloaded, making a daily average of approximately 700 tons. (b) THE TOWN. (1) General The town of Abadan is divided into the refinery and jetty area, the European residential area, and the native bazaar and living quarter. The main European area lies to the west of the refinery, the oil storage tanks to the north, and the native quarter to the east. Further to the south-east down the river lies the Bawarda storage tank area. The European quarter consists of streets of modern bungalows, with gardens garages etc in all respects resembling an English garden-suburb. ...T? 16 Company s main offices and shipping offices are situated in the refinery area. Recreational facilities include tennis courts, cricket and football grounds, polo ground, swimming pools golf course and a gymkhana club, with library, cinema, billiards room, etc. A sailors’ institute is situated 01 l^ e - riVer fr ° n 1 t The majority of the bungalows and offices are equipped with air cooling plants which is extremely beneficial to the well-being of the European community in the summer months.[Part V — ■continued'] (B) PORTS (C58272) c 3 The Company maintains a modern and well equipped air conditioned hospital with 175 beds, X-ray apparatus, pathological laboratory, etc., and in addition an emergency hospital with 150 beds. Also operated by the Company are a steam laundry, bakery, furniture repair shop and store, soda water factory, ice plant and a W/T transmitting and receiving station which is situated to the north-west of the town. Abadan is in fact a modern self-contained community. Apart from a few date gardens along the river banks and round the fringes of Abadan island, the surrounding country, when once away from the river, is nothing but arid desert and offers little but occasional gazelle shooting. The river area however abounds with numerous types of wild fowl during the winter months and the duck shooting is excellent. (2) Streets and Through-Routes All the streets in the refinery, residential and jetty area, are modern with metalled surfaces and capable of taking three lines of traffic. The main exit from Abadan is the road out to the north, past the airfield, to Khorramshahr and Ahwaz. The entire area of the Island is flat. (3) Rail Facilities The railway goods yard lies to the west side of the town and is connected by narrow gauge track with the unloading jetties and the airfield. There is no railway leading off Abadan island. There are no tunnels or bridges. (4) Population and Labour The European population in 1937 was 950 (750 men and 200 women and children). This figure has fluctuated considerably during the intervening years (1945) and is naturally entirely dependent on the policy and needs of the A.I.O.C. The native population of Abadan island was reported to be 150,000 in 1942, of which about 25,000 were in the employ of the A.I.O.C. The A.I.O.C. control the local labour market and with notice would, in normal circumstances, be able to recruit an unskilled labour force of about 5,000. (5) Government and Municipal Establishments The Persian Governor’s house, the headquarters of the local police, customs depot, quarantine authorities, military barracks and offices of the finance and education departments are all situated in the native quarter. In relation to the size of Abadan and the population, the Persian Government establishments, and staffs are very small. The A.I.O.C. maintain tactful co-operation with the local Persian officials, but the Oil Company virtually have control of the area. • (6) Billeting There is generally little accommodation available for billeting purposes. In Abadan, the bungalows are fully occupied by A.I.O.C. employees. The A.I.O.C. would probably be able to make arrangements for a small number of troops to be billeted in clubs, etc., in an emergency, but camps would have to be built for any large force or for troops remaining any length of time. A suitable site for a depot and camp area is situated due north of the Breim creek, this area is capable of expansion, and is away from the native quarter. During the war (1939-45) a large camp site was erected at the airfield for the U.S.A. forces employed in the aircraft assembly plant. It is possible that these temporary buildings may be left standing or taken over by the A.I.O.C., in either case there is a ready made potential camp site at the airfield. (7) Light and Power [a] Electricity. —The refinery has electric light which can be supplemented by searchlights. Supply is from a generating station with a maximum continuous output of 45,000 kw. at 11 kv., 3-3 kv., 440 volts. All three phase and 250 volts phase and neutral D.C. converting plant up to 2,000 kva. is available. The present refinery load is 16,000-18,000 kw. so that power is available for extraneous use which up to 2,000 kw. could be converted to D.C. in quantity. Considerable extensions to both generating and consuming plant are in hand. Generating plant (total installed) .. .. .. .. 67,000 kw. Generating plant capacity (continuous) .. .. .. 45,000 kw.

For fire and other services water is drawn direct from the river. Sanitation—The refinery and European residential quarter are provided with modern sanitation. (9) Industrial Establishments The A.I.O.C. Refinery The large oil refinery at Abadan is the main, and indeed the only industrial establishment on the island. Large quantities of fuel oil, gas oil, kerosene, paraffin, residual pitch and high grade aviation spirits are produced and exported. The A.I.O.C. maintain a printing press, bakery, steam laundry and ice making plant. Of the vast and complicated installations at the refinery, the pumping station, “ Cracking plants ” and generating station are the most vital spots, and the wrecking of any would necessitate the whole refinery closing down, and, in the case of the pumping station being wrecked, would probably result in a number of oil processing plants being burnt out. (10) Local Agriculture and Fishing There is a number of date gardens on the island and vegetables are also grown in small quantities but the bulk of the food stuffs have to be imported. In peace time the A.I.O.C. maintain their own fishing trawlers to supply the European employees. There are also a number of local fishing craft which work out of the Shatt-al-Arab river and small quantities of fish are usually obtainable in the bazaar. Small quantities of fresh meat are usually obtainable with notice, but of poor quality. No large force could depend on local resources for food. (11) Public Transport Services and Garages There is no public transport available. The A.I.O.C. maintain their own bus service for transporting employees to and from work, also a fleet of cars and trucks with an efficient garage maintenance service. (12) Fire Service The only fire service is maintained by the A.I.O.C. In 1943 a number of members of the British National Fire Service were loaned to the A.I.O.C. to reorganise and augment their fire fighting system in the light of experience gained in the London blitz. As a result it is believed that this service has been greatly improved and the equipment brought completely up to date. (13) Areas for Dumps and Parks The area to the north-west of the town, towards the airfield is suitable for dumps and parks. This area is easily connected by rail with the unloading wharf at Breim creek and can expand for several miles. It is also the opposite side of the town to the native quarters.26 (B) PORTS [Part V — continued'] Seagoing Bulk Oil Barges. Maximum Draught.

AHWAZ (Lat. 31° 29' N., Long. 48° 43' E.) [See Plans 9 and 9a and Admiralty Charts 2483, 1235 and Plans of Karun River.) (a) THE PORT (1) General Ahwaz is a small inland port situated on the Karun river about 175 miles by water from the Rooka channel at the mouth of the Shatt-al-Arab, which river is joined by the Karun at Khorramshahr, 67 miles from its mouth. Ahwaz is the centre of the grain district of south-western Persia and an important rail centre. There is considerable barge traffic between Ahwaz and Abadan, the A.I.O.C. using this method of transport for stores, engineering material, etc., to the oilfields centre at Masjid-I-Sulaiman and Haft Kel. In 1942 a branch railway, from Ahwaz to the newly developed port of Khorramshahr, was completed and it was then over this route that the “ Aid-to-Russia ” traffic was sent rather than by barge up the Karun, which had previously been the only route. A first-class road was also constructed between Khorramshahr and Ahwaz and it is possible that the development of this road and the railway may eclipse the water route to Ahwaz, although the A.I.O.C. will probably continue to use the river as most convenient for heavy machinery where time is not an important factor.[Part V — continued'] (B) PORTS The “ port ” or transhipping area consists of a small natural basin on the right bank of the river at Bandar Nasari about miles below Ahwaz. Here the A.I.O.C. have constructed a wooden jetty. From the unloading point to Ahwaz is a series of five rapids which makes navigation difficult and any goods proceeding beyond the town have to be transhipped to pass this obstruction. The Karun River The Karun is the largest Persian river and is the only one navigable by steam vessels. It rises in the mountains of the Bakhtiari country about 100 miles westward of Isfahan and flows across the plains of Arabistan to Ahwaz and thence to Khorramshahr, where it joins the Shatt-al-Arab. Proceeding upstream from Khorramshahr vessels of 12 ft. draught can go as far as Sulamania bend (14 miles above Khorramshahr). The next 96 miles up to Bandar Nasari (1| miles below Ahwaz) can only be used during the dry season (July to December) by vessels drawing 2\ ft., but from the commencement of the rains in December to May or June the river is usually passable to ships drawing 5 or 6 ft. In general, the river presents no difficulties regarding pilotage to experienced local navigators. But there are no navigational aids, and many sharp bends and shallow stretches are met, especially beyond Ali Hussain, 31 miles above Khorramshahr, where the channel is narrow and tortuous. Here the deepest water is usually found on the concave side. The Karun varies in width from 5 to 2 cables. Night navigation is possible by experienced’pilots. As far as Ahwaz the banks are low and the course is through an almost desert country but abounding with a variety of wild fowl. From Bandar Nasari to Ahwaz there is a considerable rise in the river bed, and a series of five rapids, generally considered unnavigable, exist. The real obstacle to navigation is the second rapid from the top where a reef runs out from the left bank, leaving only a channel 100 yards broad, broken by islets into two or three passages, of which the one nearest to the right bank is the easiest of ascent, but is only 50 yards wide.. The water here rushes with a fall of 1 in 50. The total loss of height between the top and bottom of the rapids is 1 ft. in “ high ” and 7 ft. in “ low ” water. These rapids can only be crossed by powerful shallow draught steamers during the months of April and May (flood season) with any degree of safety. Native boats can be brought over at any season. The reach of the upper Karun from Ahwaz to Dar-I-Khazineh (57 miles) is less easy for navigation than the lower river chiefly owing to its narrowness and its shallowness in many places. Steamers can tow two barges except during the low water period between July and December, when the capacity of one haul is reduced 50 per cent. The river is not navigable above Shalailiyeh village which is eight miles below Shushtar (81 miles beyond Ahwaz). (2) Conspicuous Objects When proceeding up the river a range of hills about 220 ft. above the surrounding plain marks the position of the town ; three small peaks lie close together, the highest, with an elevation of 420 ft., being about two miles south-eastward of Ahwaz. (3) Tides, Tidal Streams and Currents The Karun river is only tidal in the lower reaches and the level may be said to be effected only by seasonal flood water. The difference between “ high ” and “ low ” water may be taken on the average as 12-14 ft. In December and January there are usually considerable rises due to the winter rains, which, however, vary from year to year. Towards the end of January or beginning of February the river usually sinks, to rise again with the spring floods which begin at the end of February or beginning of March. At this period and as late as April, very violent and sudden rises may occur and in the second half of April there is the greatest mean volume of water in the river, which sinks steadily through May and continues to decline through June and July. The lowest water is experienced from August to November. The rate of the stream on the lower Karun when the water is high is 4 to 6 knots and when low about 2 knots. On the upper reaches of the river above the rapids at Ahwaz the rate of stream increases and during the flood season reaches 6 to 9 knots and when the water is low is about 3 knots. (4) Weather Navigation on the Karun is not affected by weather except in regard to seasonal flood water [see (3) above). (5) Anchorages There are no recognised anchorages. (6) Description of Harbour The “ harbour ” area consists of a small natural basin on the right bank at Bandar Nasari, 1| miles below Ahwaz. Here is situated the A.I.O.C. quay where barges can go alongside to be unloaded and there is a minimum depth of 6 ft. 6 ins. Further downstream on the left bank is accommodation for three barges to be moored to bollards.(B) PORTS [Part V — continued] (7) Quayage, Cranage and Clearance from Quays (a) The A.I.O.C. quay is about 700 ft. long and formed by a wooden platform on piles. Minimum depth alongside 6| ft. (b) Six river barges can be accommodated alongside and are moored to bollards. (c) There is no difficulty in berthing alongside the quay. (d) There are two 15-ton mechanical cranes fixed on the quay. A temporary derrick, with a capacity of 50 tons (capable of being rigged to 70 tons) has been erected by the A.I.O.C. and put at the disposal of the Persian Government for unloading rolling stock. (e) There are no other cranes. (/) On the quay there are double track rails about 560 yards in length, with a distance between rail centres of 30 ft. There is one crossover and a short siding close to the quay. The entire yard is capable of holding 90 wagons with an engine. This system is connected with the main Trans-Iranian railway at Ahwaz station where marshalling is normally done. (g) There are no obstructions to hinder unloading. (h) There is no electric lighting in the unloading area. (8) Accommodation Six barges of approximately 150 tons each can be accommodated at the quays and three more at the bollards lower downstream. (9) Harbour Craft The following craft, mostly owned by the A.I.O.C. ply regularly between Abadan and Ahwaz 1 tug, 250 h.p. 3 sternwheelers (steamers). 20 barges (open hatches), 100-170 tons. 5 barges (open hatches), 50-75 tons. 4 barges (closed hatches), 85-175 tons. 4 barges (for bulk oil), 110-120 tons. 2 barges (for bulk oil), 35-45 tons. (10) Landing of Men, Stores and Vehicles by Water Transport Men, stores and vehicles could all be landed easily at the A.I.O.C. and also at places where the water is deep for barges to be brought alongside the river banks. (11) Warehouses and Stacking Space The Customs have warehouses with about 2,400 square yards of stacking space. (12) Coal, Oil and Water No stocks of coal or oil are kept. The A.I.O.C. have a small drinking water plant sufficient to supply 50-100 persons daily. (13) Docks, Slipways and Repair Facilities Nil. (14) Facilities for Clearing Port Area A road from the quay leads to Ahwaz and thence to Andimeshk and Tehran. The railway joins up with the Trans-Iranian railway system at Ahwaz main station, where there is an extensive marshalling yard. (15) Normal Functions of the Port The principal traffic passing through the port in peacetime is equipment for the A.I.O.C., mostly stores and engineering materials for the oil wells. There is also a considerable amount of oil traffic proceeding north. Ahwaz is also a distributing centre for agricultural products from the surrounding provinces. (16) Estimated Daily Capacity The only statistics available are for a period of 36 months from April, 1938 to March, 1941, when the monthly average was 3,280 tons into the port and 2,200 tons out. (b) THE TOWN (1) General The town of Ahwaz is built on both sides of the Karun river and connected by a rail and a road bridge. The old part of the town is on the left bank and the majority of the more modern buildings are situated on the right bank. 5 There is a British Consul General and Consul resident in the town.[Part V — continued] (B) PORTS The majority of the buildings are of the local sunbaked mud bricks, but there are also several more modern buildings of German construction, one of these, originally built as a modern hotel, was used during the war (1939-45) as the local U.S. Army H.Q. Officers’ mess ; this is situated on the right bank and is near the Imperial Bank of Iran, also a modern building. The majority of the European bungalows are situated at the northern end of the town on the left bank. Except in the vicinity of the river the surrounding country is arid with only occasional scrub. The town is approximately 200 ft. above sea level. There are two landing grounds, one about 5 miles south-south-east of the town and the other just north-west on the right bank of the river. The main streets are reasonably wide, and during the war the surfaces were greatly improved, but the bye-streets in the native part of the town remain narrow and in poor condition. The main road into the town from the south leads from Khorramshahr and is now a first class metalled surface ; this road branches off to Andimehssk before it crosses the Karun to enter Ahwaz. Ahwaz is the junction for the railway from Khorramshahr which joins the Trans-Iranian line from Bandar Shapur at this point. The population was estimated at 30,000 in 1940. In peacetime there was a garrison of one division stationed here in the barracks ; during the war the greater part of these barracks was used as a camp for Polish refugees awaiting shipment to India. The town is on the main Persian telegraph system. The European quarter and larger buildings have modern sanitation. Ahwaz is a grain-collecting centre and has several moderate-sized silos. ASALU (Eat. 27° 29' N., Long. 52° 37' E.) [See Admiralty Charts 2837a and 748b.) (a) THE PORT (1) General Asalu is a small village on the Shibkuh coast. It is situated about half way between Bushire and Lingeh and the coastal caravan route between these two places runs past Asalu. There is an emergency landing ground 1| miles north of the village. Approaches A reef extends over half a mile offshore for a distance of about 3| miles north-westward of the northern entrance point of Naband Bay. There are depths of 5 and 6 fathoms close outside the reef which should not be approached into a depth of less than 7 fathoms (12 m. 8). (2) Conspicuous Objects There is a large date grove behind Asalu village. A conspicuous, though partially ruined, round tower stands on a hillock north-westward of it. The Customs Post is a small white building in the centre of the water front. (3) Tides, Tidal Streams and Currents The tidal streams in Naband Bay are very weak. * (5) Anchorages Anchorage off the village is open to the Shamal, the holding ground is poor and it is necessary to approach with caution as the shore reef is very steep-to. Boats pass over the reef and shelter close to the village. It is reported that there is a gap in the reef through which dhows can pass and anchor inside the reef. (6) Description of Harbour There is no pier or wharf. All cargo has to be landed in small boats and carried up the beach which is of firm sand shelving fairly steeply from above high water mark. Depth over the outlying reef is about 2 ft., depth inside the reef, close to the village is slightly greater. (14) Facilities for Clearing Port Area Rail Nil. Road Only the coastal caravan route which is not motorable. Donkey tracks run through the mountains to the hinterland.30 (B) PORTS [Part V — continued] (b) THE TOWN (1) General The village has about 400 inhabitants living in mud and stone huts, their health is poor, the majority of the population are suffering from eye diseases and malnutrition. Behind the village, fiat sandy soil extends inland for two miles to low foothills. The coastal range rises abruptly another mile inland from these foothills, to over 4,000 ft. (5) Government and Municipal Establishments There is a Customs Post. (8) Water and Sanitation The supply of water is good for this coast. There are a few storage tanks for surface rain water and there is an ample supply of well water which is sweet. The sanitation is primitive. There is no hospital. (9) Industrial Establishments 800 gallons of kerosene are kept in stock but no petrol or oil. (10) Local Agriculture and Fishing The pursuits of the local inhabitants are pearl fishing and a little agriculture, onions and tomatoes grow in small quantities, also dates, there is no wheat. BANDAR ABBAS (Lat. 27° 11' N., Long. 56° 17' E.) {See Plan 10 and Admiralty Charts 3599, 753.) (a) THE PORT (1) General The town of Bandar Abbas stands on the south-east coast of Persia facing the entrance to the Persian Gulf. The port consists of an open anchorage, but it is considerably protected by Quishm Island to. the south-west. Ihe Persian Gulf Convoy Assembly Anchorage was situated here (about 5 miles off shore between Quishm Island and Bandar Abbas) during the period 1943-45. The port is of some importance as an importing and exporting centre for south-east Persia. Approaches Vessels approaching Bandar Abbas or the anchorage off Quishm may pass one either side of Jezirat Larak. When passing between Jezirat Hormuz and Jezirat Larak, the latter may be approached to a distance of half a mile, but the eastern end of Quishm Island must be given a berth of at least 2 miles to clear the shoals off it, and Hormuz must not be closed within a distance of 2^ miles to avoid Euphrates patch. If passing between Larak and Quishm Island, the shoal ground off the western side of the former must be avoided, and the eastern end of the latter should be given a berth of at least 2 miles to clear the shoals off Quishm town. The coast southwards of the town can be approached to a distance of 1 mile until nearing the off-lying patches, 1 but the depths shoal quickly to the reef fringing the coast. It is advisable to keep on the Larak side of the channel, as the currents are irregular near the shoals off the eastern end of Quishm Island. Ships anchor to 2 miles off Bandar Abbas in the open roadstead. There is a landing ground close to the British Consulate. It has a sand surface and is 800 yards square. (2) Conspicuous Objects The British Consulate is a conspicuous, isolated grey stone, two-storeyed building, surmounted by a flagstaff, situated about 1 mile north-east of the Customs House and pier at Bandar Abbas Naiband village is situated about miles north-eastward of the pier, and its vicinity may be identified by a conspicuous date grove. (3) Tides, Tidal Streams and Currents H.M. cruisers visiting Bandar Abbas between October and January report tide sets east-north-east and west-south-west m the anchorage which at spring tides achieve speeds estimated at 2 knots or a little more. The tidal stream in the anchorage appears to change two hours later than the time of high water and low water given in the tide tables for Bandar Abbas. The tidal range is approximately 7 ft. (4) Weather During the winter winds are mainly light and variable in direction, and mostly reflect land and sea breeze influence. South-easterly winds which are sometimes experienced in November but mav occur at any time in the year, raise a considerable swell in the anchorage and the surf on the beach is very heavy, making unloading almost impossible.[Part V — continued] (B) PORTS The climate is not unduly unhealthy, and from October to April is pleasant. In winter, when the mountains to the northward are covered with snow, the air is dry, clear, and bracing. In summer, however, these rocky masses reflect heat on to the plain below and the climate is damp, hot and relaxing. The land and sea breezes do much to mitigate the heat. (5) Anchorages The best anchorages are in depth of from 5 to 13 fathoms about 1| to 3 miles off the pier. Holding ground is good and the anchorage is fairly easy to approach or leave by day or night. In January, 1943, an H.M. cruiser reports having obtained anchorage off Bandar Abbas in position 184° British Consulate Flagstaff, 3-7 miles, in 5 fathoms. Excellent holding ground in soft mud was obtained and no wind or sea was experienced. (6) Description of Harbour The harbour consists of the anchorage described in (5) and one pier opposite the Custom House. Discharge is by local craft from the anchorage. There is a firm sandy beach opposite the town, which can be used for unloading at high water when the sea is calm. (7) Quayage, Cranage and Clearance from Quays There is only one pier, a masonry one in front of the Custom House, extended by a wooden jetty on a steel structure to a total length of 1 cable. Except at the extreme end, where there is a rather dilapidated short “ T ” arm, it is estimated that this pier would support an axle load of about 3 tons. There is, however, no room for a lorry to turn round. Steps are built on either side at the end where there is a depth of 5 ft. at low water and 12 ft. at high water. A narrow-gauge railway is laid along the pier and 8 tub waggons are available, but they have to be man handled. There are no cranes and all work of unloading is done by coolies. There is no lighting on the pier. (8) Accommodation There is ample room for any number of ships tb anchor off shore and unloading is only limited by the labour available. (9) Harbour Craft There are 6 sailing dhows on immediate call for unloading purposes and more would be available with notice. There is a motor dhow belonging to the Consulate. (10) Landing of Men, Stores and Vehicles by Water Transport Men could be landed at the pier at all states of the tide, and also on the beach opposite the town at high water in suitable weather. Vehicles could be landed at the pier, provided they were driven off the lighters. The beaches could also be used for landing craft. The minimum distance from ship to shore is approximately 1 mile. (11) Warehouses and Stacking Space The Customs have 13 warehouses, with a total capacity of 200,000 cu. ft. Other privately owned warehouses in the town have a capacity of 280,000 cu. ft. (12) Coal, Oil and Water Coal and oil. Nil. A small quantity of water can be obtained for boiler purposes. (13) Docks, Slipways and Repair Facilities Nil. (14) Facilities for Clearing Port Area There are no railways. There is a good unmetalled road which carries heavy lorry traffic to Kerman and thence to Teheran. There are also roads to Minab and Ear. (15) Normal Functions of Port The principal exports are cotton, carpets, dried fruits, dates, almonds, pistachio nuts, Wool and tinned sardines (from the canning factory situated at Bandar Abbas). Imports are cotton piece goods, sugar, tea, matches, woollen goods and rice. In peace-time, the B.I. “ slow ” mail steamer normally called once a week, entering and leaving the Persian Gulf. (16) Estimated Daily Capacity Unloading is normally slow and depends on the amount of labour available. It is estimated that, weather permitting (this is an important factor with the open roadstead and unsheltered beach and pier) and with efficient organisation, 30 X 5-ton vehicles, 7 X 3^-ton vehicles and 500 tons of stores could be unloaded in 10 days.32 (B) PORTS [Part V — continued] (b) THE TOWN (1) General The town is situated on a bare sandy plain which rises gradually to some hills about 150 ft. high and which lie about a mile to the north. It extends for about 1| miles along the beach and consists of a straggling collection of houses built of sun-dried bricks. Bandar Abbas and district is under the control of a Persian Governor (Class II), who is subordinate to the Governor-General of Kerman. This official resides in a house near the British Consulate, and has an office, which is not conspicuous, 1 cable to the west of the Custom House on the sea front. There is a Persian civil hospital with 50 beds, but it is not fit for Europeans, and has no qualified doctor. . There is the usual native bazaar. The inhabitants suffer considerably from malaria, the small-pox is endemic. Cholera has been known to occur. Bandar Abbas is on the Persian telegraph system. (2) Streets and Through-Routes The streets are narrow and unpaved. * (3) Rail Facilities Nil. (4) Population and Labour The population was estimated at 10,000 in 1941. The normal labour available is 100 coolies, but given sufficient warning, a contractor could probably arrange for ten times that number. (5) Government and Municipal Establishments The only Government officials and establishments are :— Director of Customs. Chief of Police. Director of Posts and Telegraphs. The Persian Governor’s residence is near the British Consulate. The police force is small and only moderately equipped. (6) Billeting There are no buildings suitable for billeting troops. (7) Light and Power There is a 90 kw. diesel-driven dynamo, 220 A.C. which was installed in 1939 and supplies electric light to the principal buildings in the town, but the supply is subject to constant interruption. At the British Consulate there is a 2\ kw. D.C. dynamo, which can supply 220 volts and is now used as a standby. There is a 90 kw. plant at the fish canning factory (details under paragraph (9) ). (8) Water and Sanitation Drinking water is obtained from wells kt Baiband, 3 miles east-north-east of the Custom House.. It is brought by camel and donkey, and at the Consulate it is filtered and boiled. The native population also collect water in masonry tanks, called “ Birkehs,” as surface water after rain. In 1918 British occupying troops pumped water from wells three miles inland of Naiband, but all plant and pipes have now been removed. The greatest precaution should be taken before drinking any local water. Guinea worm, contracted from drinking polluted water, gives rise to serious fever and skin ulcers. There is no sanitation. (9) Industrial Establishments A.I.O.C. —The A.I.O.C. have a distributing depot 2 miles east of the town with the following stocks :— Motor spirit 4,000 gallons. Kerosene 5,000 Gas oil 25,000 Fish Canning Factory. —This factory, which is situated 3| miles outside the town, was transported from Denmark and put up by the Atlas Company. It is equipped to make tins and can the fish (mostly a local type of the sardine variety). It has also a fish oil and power plant attached, which has, however, not been in use as the fish caught locally have yielded very little oil and there is no sale in Persia for fish meal. The factory is equipped with two Danish made Bukh 90 h.p. diesel engines for the electric light and refrigerating plants. The current is thought to be 110 volts. All repairs to the plant can be carried out in the factory’s workshop, which includes an oxygen welding machine. The factory has[Part V — continued] (B) PORTS (C58272) d never been worked to its full capacity (7 tons of fish per day) owing to difficulties of supply. The total output for the 1942 season (5 months) is believed to have been 250,000 tins of sardines. The factory owns two motor trucks which are used to transport the workers to and from Bandar Abbas. During the war (1939-45) the Scandinavian management were at intervals suspected of having contact with enemy submarines, and the factory came in for a certain amount of interest and enquiry, but nothing was ever found to justify this and there now seems little doubt that there was no foundation for the suspicion. Ice Plant .—There is an ice factory near the bazaar, capacity and quality unknown. This is operated from the town, electricity supply. (10) Local Agriculture and Fishing There is little grown locally beyond melons, dates and a few vegetables, but Bandar Abbas is a distributing centre for a considerable inland area and nuts and fruit are usually available in the bazaar. Fresh meat is obtainable but of poor quality. There is a considerable number of fishing craft which supply both the canning factory and the local bazaar. The staple diet of the inhabitants of this coastal area is fish and dates. \ (11) Public Transport Services and Garages Nil. (12) Fire Service Nil. (13) Areas for Dumps and Parks There is ample space for dumps and parks outside the town. ' BANDAR SHAPUR (Lat. 27° N., Long. 42° 02' E.) (See Plans 7 and 7a and Admiralty Charts 1265 and 2837.) (a) THE PORT. (1) General Bandar Shapur is situated on the seaward edge of an extensive mud fiat on the northern side of the Khor Musa about 40 miles from its entrance at the top of the Persian Gulf. Until Bandar Shapur was selected as the main outlet to the Persian Gulf it had been a low, flat island with no connection to the shore. Development works were undertaken in conjunction with the Trans-Iranian railway, of which Bandar Shapur is the southern terminus, and the port only came into general operation in 1938 with the completion of the railway although it was officially declared open as a commercial port in 1932. During the war (1939-1945) Bandar Shapur became the principal Persian Gulf port used for “ aid to Russia ” traffic. Immediately after the occupation of Persia by the Allies plans were made for the extension of the port by the construction of lighter berths and three new deep water berths. This work was carried out by Braithwaites of Calcutta, and was completed in the spring of 1943. Cranes were introduced, lighterage was undertaken by the I.W.T. organisation and extensive develop ment of the railway facilities taken in hand by British troops. In the Khor Musa, dredging and conservancy work was carried out to improve navigation. In April 1943, the U.S.A. took over the operation of the port and railways while the British continued to undertake the lighterage. The Americans made negligible improvements to the port but extended the railway facilities. With the construction of the new wharves at Khorramshahr, and the new railway linking that port with Ahwaz, “ aid to Russia ” traffic through Bandar Shapur, and over the line Bandar Shapur- Ahwaz, ceased, and traffic previously dealt with at Bandar Shapur was transferred to Khorramshahr. Early in 1945 Persian assets at the port and on the Bandar Shapur-Ahwaz railway were handed back to the Persian authorities. Our interest in Bandar Shapur was in its strategic value as a port independent of the Shatt-al-Arab should it have been necessary to maintain an army to the northward of the Persian Gulf, as well as its use as a base for supplying Russia with war material. Port offices, officers quarters, administrative buildings, barracks, etc., are situated to the east of the railway line. There is no aerodrome at Bandar Shapur but the A.I.O.C. have a landing ground at Bandar Mashur about 7 miles up the Khor (dry weather only). Seaplanes could land in wind from any direction in the Khor Musa, Khor Doraq or Khor Maramus. There are no moorings, but it would be possible to anchor‘on the south side of the Khor. Bandar Shapur is sometimes called Bandar Gulf in order to avoid confusion with Bandar Shah, (the northern terminus of the Trans-Iranian railway) on the Caspian Sea, which latter port is sometimes called “ Bandar Caspian.”(B) PORTS [Part V — continued] Approaches Bandar Shapur is approached from the top of the Persian Gulf up the Khor Musa. This is a deep-water, wide, channel with no difficulties for pilotage of large ships. With the exception of the Shatt-al-Arab, of which only the east, or left, bank up to a point above Khorramshahr is Persian territory, the Khor Musa is the only other waterway in Persia of importance with an outlet on the Persian Gulf. The Khor Musa inlet is entered between Ras Tanub, a low point situated about 18 miles north westward of Ras Bahrgan, and Bu Sif, about 19 miles west-south-westward of Ras Tanub. Navigation is restricted by tidal flats which dry in places to a comparatively narrow channel near the western shore of the estuary. The navigable channel of the Khor Musa is entered across a bar, lying about 7 miles eastward of Bu Sif (Lat. 30° 01' N., Long. 48° 56' E.). The bar has a natural depth of 24 ft. at low water and a mean rise of 9 ft. No dredging is necessary to keep the channel clear and any ship that can cross the bar can pass up to the anchorage and the jetties. Within the bar the channel is about 1^ miles wide. The banks at the entrance to the Khor are liable to change. The bar is marked by three light-buoys, two on the western side and one on the eastern side, and the channel is well lighted and buoyed. The Khor would be impossible to block and difficult to mine. (2) Conspicuous Objects A light (Lat. 30° 27' N., Long. 49° 06' E.) is exhibited from the Bandar Shapur jetty. (3) Tides, Tidal Streams and Currents There is a mean rise of 9 ft. at the Khor Musa bar. The stream of tide is 2J to 3 knots. It is reported that the spring rise at Bandar Shapur is 19 ft. and the neap rise 12 ft. As a rough guide, the time of high water at Bandar Shapur is li hours later than at the Shatt-al-Arab bar. All tides are reported to be most irregular and except on the bar itself, unpredictable, either as to height or stream. Caution should be exercised when passing Qassar Bin Siswan, for the outgoing tidal stream there attains a rate of about 3 knots and causes eddies and tide-rips over the shoal. The most difficult part of the Khor, especially when the tidal streams are strong, is reported to be at its junction with Khor Wastah. (4) Weather Weather generally does not influence the capacity of the port. During south and south-east gales it is reported that the land to the south is inundated but there is very little wave surface in the anchorage. The rainy season begins in November. (5) Anchorages A vessel without local knowledge having crossed the bar should anchor in a depth of 7 fathoms (12 m. 8) about 3 miles above it and wait until the tide has fallen sufficiently for the mud flat on the western side to uncover. This bank is steep-to, and by following it the vessel may proceed to Khor Qanaqeh. Anchorage may be obtained off the entrance to Khor Oanaqeh with Qabr-an-Nakhuda bearing 095°, distant miles. There are four anchorages off the wharf at Bandar Shapur. The water is very deep with poor holding ground. j r r There is ample further anchorage in the Khbr for ships of any draught capable of crossing this bar. (6) Description of Harbour The port is on the Khor Musa deep water channel and consists of an area reclaimed from the mud flats about one mile long, and 400 yards wide which has been filled to a height of 5-8 ft above the natural level of the mud bank. There are berths with depths from 26 ft. 6 in. to 31 ft. at low water springs. Discharging is carried out by means of cranes or ship's derricks direct into trucks on the quays Cargo is also discharged into lighters from which cranes lift direct into trucks. ’ (7) Quayage, Cranage and Clearance from Quays There are two main jetties with frontages on the Khor Musa. (a) The old jetty. This is constructed of braced timber and deep steel piles. It runs west and east and is approximately 800 ft. long and 41 ft. wide. There is a least depth of 31 ft. at the seaward side of the jetty which gives berthina snarp fnr two vessels. The inner side of the jetty shoals rapidly but can be used at all tides for berthing vessdl with a draught of 6 ft. and a beam of not more than 20 ft. S vt.bseis[Part V — continued] (B) PORTS (C58272) (6) The new jetty. This is constructed of steel with wooden decking. It runs approximately east by north and west by south and is approximately 1,680 ft. and 75 ft. wide. There is berthing space for three ships of 500 ft. in length. The depth of water in the berths at low water springs is as follows :— Berth No. 1 .. .. .. .. 28 ft. 6 ins. Berth No. 2 .. .. .. .. 26 ft. Berth No. 3 . . .. .. . . 26 ft. 6 ins. There is a lighter unloading area on the Khor Zangi, above the jetties. Cranes During the occupation of the port by the Allies cargo was lifted by means of travelling cranes of various capacities and a floating crane was obtained from Basra to deal with heavy loads. At present there are no cranes, unloading is done with ships’ derricks. Rail Facilities. —The old jetty is connected at the eastern end to the reclaimed land of the port area by a wooden causeway about 300 yards in length which carries a single railway track. The new jetty carries three lines of railway which converge into one line when they join the lines from the old jetty. The rails link with the railway station and the marshalling yard behind the station. All tracks are standard gauge. Lighting. —Lighting is by electricity derived from a small power plant. ITater.—Water is carried from the Jarrahi river at Gorgor, 30 miles up the railway line by a 5-in. and a 6-in. pipeline, extra supplies can be brought by barge from the A.I.O.C. at Bandar Mashur. Water pipes have been laid on the jetties. There is a water filtration and chlorinating plant. The water in the Khor is salt. (8) Accommodation There is berthing accommodation at the wharves for five ships of 500 ft. length. There are four anchorages off the wharf and practically unlimited anchorage in the Khor. Any ship with a draught which can cross the Khor Musa bar can be accommodated. (9) Harbour Craft Local harbour craft consist of one tug and three lighters. One W.T. can be obtained from Basra. (10) Landing of Men and Stores by Water Transport Stores and troops could be landed at the jetties or, if these were unusable, at the lighterage area. (11) Warehouses and Stacking Space There are 10 closed-in railway sheds with a capacity of about 12,000 tons. Stacking space is somewhat limited and the port has sometimes been congested. (12) Coal, Oil and Water Coal .—No stocks of coal are kept. Oil .—Any fuel can be supplied by rail tank car to ships alongside but notice is required. There is an oil loading terminus at Bandar Mashur, 7 miles east-north-east of Bandar Shapur. The terminus was constructed so that, in the event of the Rooka channel being blocked, oil from Abadan could be embarked. There are two berths, each consisting of four buoys moored in a rectangle to which vessels are made fast. Vessels up to 550 ft. in length can be accommodated. The loading rates would be :— Fuel or diesel oil .. .. .. 500 tons per hour. Benzine . . .. .. . . 420 tons per hour. The maximum capacities would be :— Fuel or diesel oil .. .. .. 130,000 tons per month. Benzine* .. . . .. . . 200,000 tons per month. Aviation spirit would not be obtainable by reason of technical difficulties attendant on piping it from Abadan. Tanks are situated inland two miles over the flats. There are six delivery tanks each of 19,000 tons capacity and two bunkering tanks each of 5,000 tons capacity. There is also a small power house and pumping plant and a few Nissen huts. The approach up the Khor to Mashur is narrow, but deep and clear and there is a depth of 45 ft. at low water on the berths. Fresh water can be supplied, by barge, which is suitable for drinking after chlorinating but would require to be softened or evaporated for use in ships’ boilers. This loading terminus is not now being used.(B) PORTS [Part V — continued] (13) Docks, Slipways and Repair Facilities The floating dock formerly at the port has been removed. There is a slipway capable of handling small craft and barges. There are no repair facilities. (14) Facilities for Clearing Port Area Port clearance is by means of the railway to Ahwaz. The railway is single track, standard gauge. (15) Normal Functions of Port In normal times traffic passing through the port has consisted principally of goods required by the Persian Government and Army such as railway material, rolling stock, cement, steel machinery and arms. » There is a small export trade consisting of general produce and coral rock. Average monthly tonnages in 1938 and 1939 were 9,100 import and 640 export. (16) Estimated Daily Capacity With constant shipping at the port and sufficient rolling stock available the estimated daily capacity is approximately 3,000 tons. A ship can discharge 700 tons per day. (b) THE TOWN (1) General Bandar Shapur, apart from the port and port services consists only of a small native village situated on the sandy desert outside the port. The population is a “ floating ” one, diminishing in the summer months. The whole site consists of reclaimed land which forms an island connected with the mainland by a causeway. The nearest town is Bandar Mashur. The only telegraph systems are those belonging to the railway. Telephones are connected to Basra through Ahwaz, Abadan and Mashur. (2) Streets and Through-Routes There are about 2| miles of made-up roads in the area. (3) Rail Facilities Bandar Shapur is the main southern terminus of the Trans-Iranian railway. It runs via Ahwaz to the north via Qum and Tehran. It is a single track line and runs on to and along the jetty. The station and marshalling yards are to the north-east of the jetty. There are no repair facilities. (4) Population and Labour The population of Bandar Shapur is a “ floating ” one, diminishing in the summer months ; the numbers are not known. All the coolie quarters are at Sarbandar, 6 miles up the railway line. Bandar Mashur, about 7 miles up the Khor, is the nearest town and has a population of about 5,000. (5) Government and Municipal Establishments Government establishments are the wharves, railway station, warehouses and yards, the customs and telegraph offices. During the occupation by British and American forces the following buildings were erected to the east of the railway line :— Bungalow occupied by the U.S. Commanding Officer. U.S. Army Headquarters Office. U.S. Army A.T.S. Office. Bungalow for Naval Officer-in-Charge and Offices shared with the British Town Major. British Army Officers' Mess. Port Officer’s bungalow and offices. Russian Headquarters—two buildings. Hospital covering 37,000 sq. ft. Medical Officer’s Headquarters. Three brick barrack buildings, 96 ft. by 18 ft. Heat Stroke building. Ice Plant. Water Filtration and Chlorinating Plant. Two Red Cross huts. Two Motor Pool buildings.[Part V— continued'] (B) PORTS D 3 (C58272) Camp Area. —In the camp area situated to the north-east of the railway station the following buildings have been erected Three block &gt; of Officers’ Quarters—16 rooms each. U.S. Army Officers’ Mess and Club. Seven Mess Halls. Two Recreation Rooms. Seven Administrative buildings. Guard-house and Stockade. A.T.S. Gear shed. Port Engineer’s Office, Labour Office and Tool Shop. Two General Buildings. Outdoor Theatre. Chapel. Bakery. Two Post Exchange Buildings, and One Post Exchange Store. (6) Billeting There are three brick barrack buildings 96 ft. by 18 ft. (7) Light and Power There are the following small power plants :— Two diesel-driven generators developing 27 kW., each at 220 volts D.C. A 7-5 kW. set of the same voltage. Two of 220 volts A.C., developing 500 kW. (8) Water and Sanitation The water in the Khor, although some 35 miles from the sea, is salt ; water is therefore brought from Gorgor, 30. miles up the railway line by pipe-line. Native sanitation is primitive. (9) Industrial Establishments The Strick Line and Messrs. Gray Mackenzie have branch offices in the area. Before the occupation by Allied Forces, loading and unloading of cargo was a government monopoly and was carried out by Iranbar, a department of the Ministry of Finance. (10) Local Agriculture and Fishing Practically none. (11) Public Transport Services and Garages Only the railway. (12) Fire Service There is a small fire station with some simple fire fighting equipment. (13) Areas for Dumps and Parks There is some stacking space to the west of the railway line, but this is limited by reason of the smallness of the whole area. BUSHIRE (Lat. 28° 59' N., Long. 50° 50' E.) (See Plans 4 and 4a and Admiralty Chart 27.) (a) THE PORT (1) General Bushire lies towards the north-east corner of the Persian Gulf. It was at one time the principal sea port of Persia, but has been completely overshadowed since the outbreak of war (1939-45), by the largely expanded ports of Khorramshahr and Bandar Shapur. Bushire proved its value as an auxiliary port during the period 1942-43, when the U.K.C.C. had a vehicle assembly plant there, and its potentialities could be greatly increased with the expenditure of even a little money. The port consists of an open roadstead with an inner and outer anchorage. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has his headquarters at Bushire ; there is also a British Consul. The Political Resident has a status of Consul-General. Bushire is the administrative headquarters of the Persian Province of the Gulf Ports, also of Dashti and Dashtistan. There is a landing ground If miles south of the town. The present runways were made in 1943 and are in good condition. There is a small hangar and one office building. This was a stopping place for Dutch K.L.M. and French airlines before 1939. The Khor SultanI is most suitable for flying boats, where moorings could be laid.38 (B) PORTS [Part V—continued] Approaches In clear weather, the position of a vessel may be determined at some distance from the port by bearings of Gisakan bluff, Khurmuj, and Burial page 226 and 149 of P.G. Pilot, and view on Chart 27). Approaching from south-eastward, a vessel should steer to pass about 6 miles off Ras Halileh, and thence continue north-westward in depths of not less than 6 fathoms (11 m. 0), anchoring according to draught southward of the light buoy at the outer anchorage. From south-westward, Imamzadeh mosque, and the British Residency close southward of it, as well as telegraph buildings at Reshire (Rishahr) will be the first objects sighted, showing white, especially in the afternoon sun. The depths decrease regularly as the coast is approached. Small vessels may keep near the coast, according to draught. Approaching from the northward, a vessel, when passing Ras-ash-Shatt, should not get into depths of less than 10 fathoms (18 m. 3) and should keep in that depth until the light buoy marking the outer anchorage is sighted. (2) Conspicuous Objects There are two conspicuous 200-ft. W/T masts and telegraph buildings situated about 1,000 yards north of Reshire Point, in position Lat. 28° 57' N., Long. 50° 50' E. A conspicuous building with two towers (previously the Soviet Consulate), surrounded by an extensive wall, is situated on the coast about If miles north-north-eastward of the coastal village of Mufqa’eh, and about 7 cables northward is the British Town Residency at Bushire with a flagstaff near it. A light is exhibited, at an elevation of 94 ft., from a white steel structure with red bands, 87 ft. in height, situated at the west side of the airfield about 2| miles north of Reshire Point. This is visible . for 16 miles. Imamzadeh, on the highest part of the land eastward of Reshire Point, is a conspicuous domed mosque, situated about 1|- miles eastward of the point. A small village surrounds the mosque. The majority of the buildings are white and show up well in the afternoon sun. There are not many lights visible at night, since most of the main streets face inland. (3) Tides, Tidal Streams and Currents In the offing, the tidal streams set up and down the coast, but are weak. The average range is approximately 7 ft., but this varies considerably with the seasons and weather conditions. In the entrance of the harbour the tidal streams set northward and southward near Raq’at-as-Safli, they set eastward and westward across the shoals at the mouth of Khor Sultani. In the Inner Anchorage, they set from north-north-eastward to east-north-eastward, and from south-south-westward to west-south-westward ; ’ at spring tides they attain a rate of 1 knot, and at neaps, from a quarter to half a knot. Northward and eastward of the Inner Anchorage, the tidal streams over the flats are weak. In Khor Sultani, the tidal streams are very strong off the town and round the northern end of Jazirat Shaikh Sa ad. The July spring tide is the highest of the year. The winds have considerable effect on the tidal streams ; the Shamal (north-westerly wind) causes the stream to turn later and lowers the general level, sometimes as much as 1 ft. ; the Kaus (south-easterly wind), on the other hand, raises the general level. In summer, the day tides are higher than the night tides ; in winter the reverse is the case. At all times the rise of the lower tide is very small. (4) Weather Any strong north or south winds are liable to raise sufficient sea in the Outer Anchorage to prevent communication between ship and shore and restrict any unloading into lighters ; it is also applicable only in a lesser degree, to the Inner Anchorage. These winds are liable to occur at any time of the year, but are considerably more prevalent in the winter months. Extremely high temperatures are experienced from June to September, when they may reach anything up to 120° in the shade, but the humidity at Bushire is comparatively low in relation to many other places in the Persian Gulf. ' The high summer temperature does not appreciably affect the work of local labour, but Europeans find it extremely trying working in the open. It is cool from November to March (except at mid-day) and the general winter climate is very pleasant. ^ J Rainfall is low and averages 10 in. a year, which generally falls in December and January. Dust storms occur with northerly winds during the summer months and mav considerably affect visibility off-shore. v J The sea temperature is high during the summer months and between June and September 13th seldom below 90°. (5) Anchorages Outer Anchorage .—Marked by a white flashing buoy. This anchorage is completely exposed to the prevailing north and south winds, and contact between ship and shore cannot always be made especially during the winter months, when high seas may be expected for periods of several da V s’ There is ample water here for vessels of deep draught up to 36 ft., and the holding ground is good(B) PORTS [Part V — continued] v 4 (C58272) except to the southward. Care must be taken to keep clear of the submarine cables which emanate from the cable station at Reshire in Dastak Bay. The distance from this anchorage to the Customs Pier at Bushire is 7-8 miles. Anchorage space is unlimited. Inner Anchorage. —This is approached from the Outer Anchorage by a channel marked by a red flashing buoy, and the actual anchorage is marked by a dumb buoy, distance from the Customs pier about 2-| miles. Vessels of not more than 15 ft. draught can safely use this anchorage which is less liable to be unapproachable from the shore in bad weather than the Outer Anchorage. Between the Inner Anchorage and the Customs pier is a bar covered by 11-12 ft. of water at high tide, but there is deeper water inside, at the Customs pier, and in a creek known locally as Khor Sultani, up to the A.I.O.C. jetty. (6) Description of Harbour The harbour consists of an embankment half a mile in length, running along the southern side of the Khor Sultani. This is divided into a series of wharves and jetties in various states of repair. The Khor Sultani is approached across the bar in depths of from about three-quarters of a fathom to one fathom. As there is usually a confused sea on the bar, boats with a draught of more than 3 ft. should be cautious of entering within two hours of low water. Abreast Alafdan, the entrance is about half a mile wide with depths in it of from 1 to 11 fathoms ; abreast the town it is about 1 cable wide with depths of 4 to 7 fathoms with a hard bottom. There are no mooring buoys laid, but there is room for lighter moorings opposite the town. Discharge is from lighters or local craft alongside the wharves. The port area may be said to extend for half a mile, the length of the embankment. Except for the sheds in the immediate vicinity of the New Customs wharf the area is not enclosed. The port offices are established at the New. Customs wharf. The whole port area could be considerably improved and enlarged without excessive expenditure. (7) Quayage, Cranage and Clearance from Quays [a) The quayage space consists of a series of wharves and jetties along the embankment on the Khor Sultani. This embankment is built of mud and sand faced with large stones, except at the New Customs wharf, where the construction is of wood and concrete. The height of the embankment nearly coincides with the level of the water at highest tides, which usually just reaches the top. The wharves and jetties from north to south are The Old Customs Wharf.— yards in length and 60 ft. wide, with about 1 ft. of water alongside at low tide. This wharf was repaired by the U.K.C.C. in 1942 and is now (1945) in a reasonable condition. The frontage could be improved and extended without any great expenditure, but the present construc tion would not take much heavy modern M.T. without strengtheaing. The New Customs Wharf. —About 100 yards in length and 60 ft. wide with 5 to 7 ft. of water alongside at low tide. It is constructed of concrete and wood and is in good condition, capable of taking heavy weights. At high tide the water just reaches the level of top of both the Old and New Customs wharves, and at the highest tides they are almost awash. Residency Jetty. —This adjoins the New Customs wharf ; it is 30 ft. in length and about 12 ft wide, with 2 ft. of water alongside at low tide. It is of wooden construction with an iron frame. Part of the frame is buckled, so that the ramp is not level. This jetty is in poor condition and would require considerable repairs before it could be used by M.T. Poodar Jetty. —This belongs to the A.I.O.C. and is situated 1| miles south-east of the New Customs wharf, further up the Khor Sultani. The jetty is 280 ft. by 6 ft., with a 20-ft. “ T ” piece at the end. It is in good condition. Two dolphins, 70 ft. apart, are placed off the end of the jetty. Depth of water at high tide is 15 ft. (average) and at low tide 8 ft. At Dastak below the Reshire cable station there is an old wharf of stone and cement, but it is now almost completely in ruins. The wharfage area of about 4,000 sq. ft. would be of use in calm weather conditions for landing purposes. Owing to the rocky nature of the bottom and the depth of water alongside, i.e., 3 ft., it could only be used in calm weather. (b) Only lighters or shallow draught craft can berth alongside. Three or four lighters only can be accommodated close to the cranes, but if some, or all, of the lighters were to be unloaded solely by coolie labour, up to 25 lighters of 15-20 tons dead weight could be accommodated on the quay front at one time. There are no oiling or coaling berths. Lighter moorings could be laid in the Khor Sultani opposite the wharves. (c) The bottom is mostly sand or mud and craft may safely take the ground alongside at low water, and continue to discharge. [d) On the New Customs wharf there are One fixed 5-ton hand crane with 8 ft. radius. Two 10-ton power cranes, mounted on tractors and in good condition. Spare cable is available. There are no cranes on the other quays.(B) PORTS [Part V — continued'] (e) There are no other cranes. (/) There is a light Decauville railway system, with about 200 yards of rails on the New Customs wharf. About 100 trucks are available. There is turning space for lorries and a road leading from all wharves to the town. (g) There are no overhead obstructions to hamper unloading. [h] The wharves are not lit for night work, but electric light is available. (8) Accommodation No ships can enter the harbour and all craft are limited to those which can cross the bar (11-12 ft. at high water). There is ample anchorage space at both the Inner and Outer anchorage (see Section (5) ) limited only by the capacity of the port to handle cargo. (9) Harbour Craft Motor Launches. —A.I.O.C. launch with an approximate carrying capacity of 25. Iranian quarantine launch—a steel boat, about 30 tons, equipped with a fumigating plant, capacity of 60. Motor Dhows .—Residency dhow of about 15 tons, approximate carrying capacity 25, Gray Mackenzie's dhow of the same capacity. Other Dhows .—There are usually 20 in the harbour of which two or three are motor driven. The average cargo capacity is 20 tons. There are no tugs, but in addition to the above there are a few trading sailing dhows of over 30 tons and numerous fishing boats. _ Lighters are not normally kept in the harbour, but these could* readily be obtained from Basra or Abadan. One or two tugs could be obtained from the same source, but shallow draught motor boats would be of more use for towing lighters. (10) Landing of Men, Stores and Vehicles by Water Transport Men, stores and vehicles can be landed at the Old and New Customs wharves on the Khor Sultani. The Residency Jetty (if repaired) and the Poodar Jetty could both also be used, but for light M.T. only. Distance from the Inner Anchorage about 3| miles. During the operations in 1918 practically all the troops and stores for the forces were landed at the above wharves. Troops, animals and baggage were put ashore with the greatest ease. As the decks of lighters are at all states of the tide within a few feet of the wharf level there would be no difficulty with vehicles- Dastak below Reshire Point (for details 7 (a), paragraph (6) ) could also be used for troops and stores in calm weather. • Turther south in Halileh Bay, the beach is low and sandy, with between 2 and 3 fathoms of water, and would be suitable for landing heavy vehicles from landing craft. Here there is a good anchorage for small vessels during Shamals, in three fathoms, about half a mile offshore. (11) Warehouses and Stacking Space There are eight warehouses, average dimensions 90 ft. by 35 ft. by 15 ft., at the New Customs wharf, all of which are in good condition. They have concrete floors and ventilated corrugated iron roofs. A hand trolley system simplifies the transport from wharf to warehouse. There is also ample open stacking space along the waterfront, and several large godowns in various parts of the town. (12) Coal, Oil and Water (a) Coal. —Nil. (b) Oil. There are no facilities for fuelling ships and no stocks are maintained The A I O C have the following stocks of petrol, kerosene, etc. One tank containing 225,000 gallons of petrol. Two tanks containing 100,000 gallons of furnace oil each. One tank containing 100,000 gallons of kerosene. One tank containing 46,000 gallons of kerosene. One tank containing 30,000 gallons of heavy diesel oil. There are three storehouses (150 ft. by 30 ft. by 14 ft.) containing stocks, in drums and 4-gallon Poodar ^ 0 ' ’ ker ° Sene ’ petro1 ' avlation s P irit and D 'T-D. lubricating oil. These are situated at (c) Water. There is no water to allow for supplying ships. (13) Docks, Slipways and Repair Facilities Nil. Minor welding repair jobs might Spinning and Weaving Mill, situated at be undertaken by the factory workshop of the Ettimadieh Binmaneh, about 1^ miles south of Bushire.[Part V — continued] (B) PORTS (14) Facilities for Clearing Port Area The only method of clearing the port area is by road. The wharves and jetties are all connected with the town by unmetalled, and in most cases rather narrow streets. In the event of heavy rain (an extremely rare occurrence), the surface becomes very muddy and sticky. Owing to the small amount of ground available in the rear of the wharves, it is essential to have abundant transport and a large number of coolies always available at the landing place to prevent congestion. A moderately good road connects Bushire with Reshire and the Residency, but it is deteriorating (1945). The road to Shiraz was maintained by the Royal Engineers in 1942-43, and although it has been handed over to the Persians it is still in good condition. The coast road to Lingeh is only fit for M.T. as far as Khormuj (50 miles south of Bushire) ; there after for animals only. The road to Bandar Dilam is motorable in fine weather, and connects with a first-class road (maintained by the A.I.O.C.) from Gavaneh to Gach Saran and Bahbehan. There are caravan routes to Farrashband and Firuzabad. (15) Normal Functions of Port The chief exports are cotton, opium, gum, poppy seed and mohair. General merchandise is imported which includes mainly rice, tea, flour, sugar, grain, timber and cloth, much of it is for the hinterland. Tonnage handled 1935-36 : Imports, 21,000 tons ; Exports, 19,000 tons. There is regular B.I. steamer communication between India, Bushire, Khorramshahr and Basra. There is also a subsidiary service to and from India, calling at all the Gulf Ports. At certain seasons, there is considerable dhow trade using the port. (16) Estimated Daily Capacity At present only two ships can be unloaded at one time. But estimated on figures available for 1942 when all the resources of the port were available the approximate daily discharge was 600 tons, in good weather. Under normal peacetime conditions, the daily rate of discharge is approximately 250 tons of mixed cargo per day. (b) THE TOWN (1) General The town of Bushire is on the northern tip of a torpedo-shaped promontory lying parallel to the coast on the north-west of the district of Ears at a distance of 4 to 5 miles, the intervening space being occupied by a swampy mud plain (Mashlleh), across the middle of which runs a road to the mainland. The peninsula measures 12 miles from its north-west point, on which stands the town of Bushire, to Ras Halileh in the south. The maximum breadth is 3| miles. Seven miles south of Bushire, on the coast, lies the village of Reshire. The plain of Mashileh becomes swampy in wet weather, forming a serious obstacle to an advance inland from Bushire, and to the maintenance of communications. The water level on the Mashileh is at 6 ft. The town is poorly built, and there is no attempt at drainage. Some of the main streets have been relaid and pavements made, while electric lighting has been installed. While it has been eclipsed as a port by Khorramshahr (in the Shatt-al-Arab river) and Bandar Shapur (in the Khor Musa) it is still the principal Persian town in the Gulf. It derives what little importance which still survives from its position as an import, export and distributing centre for the districts of Isfahan, Shiraz and Kazerun. Very few of the imports are actually consumed in the town. The buildings are mostly of Gutch (local cement) with the better ones of stone. The few Europeans live in villas well outside the town. In addition to the houses of the British residents other private buildings of note are : the Persian Governor’s Residence on the west sea wall of the town, the U.S.S.R. Consulate three-quarters of a mile to the south of the town, the Turkish Consulate near the British Town Residency ; the French, German and Dutch Consulates are further southward of the town. There are no incumbents in any of these five Consulates (1945). (2) Streets and Through-Routes The streets of the town are narrow and dirty and there is no attempt at drainage. The streets wind from the port area to the town exit. (3) Rail Facilities Nil.42 (B) PORT [Part V — continued] (4) Population and Labour In 1936 the population was estimated at about 25,000 ; in recent years this has dropped heavily and is now (1945) little over 15,000. This decrease is due largely to the fact that whereas in former years numbers of coolies from Bushire were employed each year during the date picking season in Iraq, latterly their place has been taken by Iraquis. The inhabitants are of mixed Persian and of Arab blood ; they are occupied mainly in seafaring, agriculture and trade. There are about 30 European inhabitants mainly employed in the Consular Services, Bank, the A.I.O.C. and by Messrs. Gray Mackenzie. Coolies are used for cargo work and about 250 are obtainable at short notice through Gray Mackenzie’s agent. Their hours of work vary, but are usually 0600 to 2400. Rate of pay fluctuates. There is virtually no skilled labour available. (5) Government and Municipal Establishments The barracks of the Bushire garrison are situated near Reshire, about 3-| miles south of Bushire. The buildings are mostly of Gutch and of simple construction. No electric light is installed. In 1934 the garrison consisted of 850 troops. The Governor has an office in one of the larger houses on the sea wall on the western side of the town. The former British Hospital, which was very up-to-date and had accommodation for 20 patients, has now been taken over as a Persian Government Hospital. (6) Billeting There is accommodation for troops, animals, etc., in the peninsula, provided that private houses, godowns, etc., are commandeered or rented. In 1918-19, the British Forces in the Bushire Command, consisting of a maximum of six battalions of Indian Infantry, one squadron of cavalry, one mountain battery with ancillary units were accommodated in Bushire, Reshire and elsewhere on the peninsula. This included taking over the greater portion of the private houses in Reshire. Most of these houses are still in a good state of repair. This accommodation had to be augmented by hutted camps. None of the houses has any sanitation, but the majority are on the town electricity supply. (7) Light and Power [a] Electricity (i) Local generating station. (ii) The plant is situated at the southern end of the town. (iii) The town supply is 50 kW. Two diesel-driven 8-kW. plants supplying the Residency and Consulate. 460/500 volt. D.C. 3-wire system. There is a battery charging plant at Cable and Wireless’s station, Reshire. (iv) Distribution is by overhead wire. [b] Gas.—Nil. (8) Water and Sanitation A small dam was completed at the end of 1943 at Bandar Andar which is designed to hold up to 1,500,000 gallons of rain water. The Persian Government are engaged in installing a drinking water scheme for the town, the water for which is to be piped from Aali Changi and Tul-i-Siah, about 25 kilometres away. This was not completed by the end of 1944, but considerable progress had been made. There are wells at Reshire, Bandar Andar, Zangina, Graribu and Sangi, which were used for drinking purposes during the operations in 1918, but the water is very brackish and it is now only used for washing by the European inhabitants. There are two condensers which, though they may (rather doubtful) be capable of being repaired, are not now in operation. The bigger one is at Dastak and was installed in 1918 with a capacity of 4,000 gallons a day. The smaller one with a capacity of 300 gallons a day was installed to supply drinking water to the Europeans. A storage tank in the telegraph concession at Reshire, with a capacity of 68,000 gallons, has been disconnected from the condensers, but is reported to be still in reasonable condition. There is ample water for animals and washing (except perhaps after an exceptional period of drought). At all times, however, the greatest precautions should be taken to ensure that well water is rendered fit for drinking. The present water supply is sufficient for little more than the needs of the population during the dry season (March to November). There is no sanitation. (9) Industrial Establishments The Ettimadieh Spinning and Weaving Mill situated at Bahmani, is one of the biggest cotton mills in Persia ; the numbers employed in the spinning and weaving section at March, 1944, were 800 and 228 respectively. The machinery is mostly British, but one of the three Diesel power plants[Part V — continued] (B) PORTS now in use is a Siemens production. The factory workshop is quite well fitted and welding work can be undertaken. Two- more Diesel (Mirrlees) engines were to be installed and the number of looms increased. Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co., Shipping Agents, have a branch office in the town and deal with all loading and unloading and necessary coolie labour. There is a branch of the Imperial Bank of Iran in the town (with a British manager). There is also a small cotton piece goods factory. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company have an agent in Bushire and maintain stocks of petrol and lubricating oil (details under (a) THE PORT). (10) Local Agriculture and Fishing Local agriculture is confined to growing a small amount of vegetables and a little grain, but lack of rain, and water for irrigation restricts this to a minimum and the bulk of these supplies are imported from Iraq or brought from up country. Dates are grown in very small quantities and are also largely imported from Iraq. There are a number of fishing vessels attached to the port and fresh or dried fish is usually obtainable. Fresh meat is difficult to obtain without previous notice. (11) Public Transport Services and Garages Nil. (12) Fire Service Nil. (13) Areas for Dumps and Parks There is ample space for dumps and parks on the flat ground to the south of the town. It would be advisable during the winter months when rain may be expected, to establish any semi-permanent dumps on the higher ground at Reshire, but the extremely small annual rainfall makes almost any position near the Bushire-Reshire road suitable. CHAHBAR (Lat., 25° 16' 28' N. Long, 60° 26' 4' E.) {See Plans 11 and 11a and Admiralty Chart 38) (a) THE PORT (1) Cenex al Chahbar is the best and indeed the only harbour on the coast of Persian Makran. The town and port lie at the head of a small bay between Chahbar Point and Tiz Point, within Chahbar Bay on the Makran coast of the Arabian Sea. Distant about 180 miles from Jask, 60 miles from the Indian frontier and 320 miles west of Karachi. Approaches Chahbar Bay is approached direct from the sea, in deep water, between Ras Kuhlab and Chahbar Point; there is no entrance channel and pilotage is unnecessary at any season. A reef extends about 3 cables westward from the point, and, for a distance of about 1 cable farther on, the bottom is foul. The north-western side of the point is bordered by a reef, and foul ground extends about 2| cables off-shore, as far north-eastward as a small clump of date trees near the ruins of a fort ; northward of these trees the beach is sandy. Tiz Point lies about 3| miles northward of Chahbar Point and the intervening coast forms the small bay, at the head of which is Chahbar town. (2) Conspicuous Objects Between Chahbar Point and the town, the shore is bounded by sandhills 20 to 30 ft. high. North of the town the land rises to a high tableland, 480 ft. high, being almost precipitous in places ; its base forms the north side of the bay. Eight miles inland, parallel to the coast, is a range of mountains. One of its summits, Quoin Peak (2,400 ft.), is a conspicuous landmark. Chahbar Point is low and rocky and on it are some small sand hills ; near its extremity is a small square tomb with a white dome, about 1 mile east-north-eastward of which are two dark-coloured flat-topped buildings, one of which is the telegraph office, which assist in identifying the point ; this building is visible from south-eastward. A light is exhibited, at an elevation of 36 ft., from the roof of the telegraph office. (3) Tides, Tidal Streams and Currents The difference between high and low water is 6 ft. Spring tides rise 9 ft. The tidal streams in the bay are scarcely perceptible.44 (B) PORTS [Part V — continued] (4) Weather The climate is fairly healthy and comparatively cool for the greater part of the year. Except during the monsoon season, light winds of land and sea breeze type prevail. During the south-west monsoon, south-south-easterly winds of some strength are common by day but fall light by night ; these winds cause a heavy sea to break all round the shores of the bay, except near the town, which is sheltered. The Shamal is fairly frequent in winter. Average temperature, January, 60° F. Average temperature, July, 84° F. Annual rainfall is very small. (5) Anchorages Anchorage may be obtained by small vessels in Chahbar Bay, in a depth of about 4 fathoms, sand bottom, with the tomb on Chahbar Point bearing 170° and the mosque in the town bearing 110 . Larger vessels may safely anchor further out, ships of 2,000 tons approximately 1J miles off-shore and 5,000 to 10,000 ton vessels up to 2| miles off. During the south-west monsoon, when a heavy south-south-easterly swell is rolling into the bay, sheltered anchorage with no swell may be obtained about 3^ miles eastwards of Kunarak village, which is situated on the western shore of the bay about 5§ miles north-westward of Ras Kuhlab. Anchorage in Chahbar Bay is prohibited southward of a line drawn 270° from the mosque in the town. (6) Description of Harbour There is no artificial harbour. For description of Chahbar Bay, see (1) General. (7) Quayage, Cranage and Clearance from Quays There are no quays or cranes. All cargo is unloaded from local craft on to two sandy beaches. One in front of the Custom House and the other under the barracks. The former place cannot be used during the south-west monsoon—15th May to 15th September—owing to the heavy swell. Unloading can be done at all states of the tide. (8) Accommodation There is ample room in the anchorage for a number of ships. (9) Harbour Craft There are five sailing craft, 20-ton capacity, which are available and used exclusively for lighterage. They can be beached at any state of the tide. (10) Landing of Men, Stores and Vehicles by Water Transport Both the beaches described in paragraph (7) are suitable for landing men, stores and M.T. Each is approximately 150 yards long. The distances from anchorages depend entirely on the draught of ships concerned. 2 fathoms off-shore is | a mile distant. 4£ fathoms off-shore is 2| miles distant. The best landing place is the one directly under the barracks where a good lee is given by a flat rock. (11) Warehouses and Stacking Space There is one godown in the town, 150 ft. by 50 ft., with a capacity of 400 tons general merchandise. There is one open dump area with a capacity of 20,000 tons. Covered sheds would be essential in the monsoon season. (12) Coal, Oil and Water There is no coal or oil. No boiler water is available. (13) Docks, Slipways and Repair Facilities Nil. (14) Facilities for Clearing Port Area A road, impassable after heavy rain, connects Chahbar with Zahidan (about 468 miles) via Tiz Point, Geh, Tank Sari, Iranshahr and Mirjawa. The road between Chahbar and Iranshahr is bad. At present no wheeled traffic can proceed farther than 2 miles from Chahbar owing to the road in places having crumbled away, particularly 2J miles from Chahbar, where the road runs round the side of a mountain with a steep ravine on one side. Here the road has fallen completely away, leaving only a narrow ledge. At other places the road has been blocked by falls of rock. At Tank Sari, where the road crosses a river bed, it is impassable in winter.[Part V — continued] (B) PORTS Considerable repair work would have to be undertaken before even moderate traffic could use this road. Beyond Iranshahr the road improves and from there to Zahidan is good for two lines of traffic. The Persian Government had intentions of connecting Chahbar with Bandar Abbas by a motorable road running along the seashore, but nothing has been done so far. (15) Normal Functions of Ports There is a small amount of coastal dhow trade with Baluchistan, India and the Gulf. A number of fishing craft are attached to the port. (16) Estimated Daily Capacity Present capacity approximately 180 tons of general cargo per day, using the two existing landing places. During the south-west monsoon, only one landing place can be used ; this reduces the unloading to approximately 36 tons per day. Suggestions were put forward in 1943 for increasing the capacity to 300 tons per day. (b) THE TOWN (1) General The town is situated on the eastern side of Chahbar Bay, about miles north-eastward of the Point ; it consists chiefly of tumble-down mud buildings intersected by narrow alley-ways, in a deserted condition. Of the few buildings in good repair are :—• The Custom House, which faces the shore and has a small godown and courtyard ; The Governor’s house and the offices of the B.I.S.N. agent—all two-storeyed buildings. A quarter of a mile south of the town stands an old fort, adjacent to which are five uncompleted, one-storeyed buildings 140 ft. by 50 ft. belonging to the Persian Army. A quarter of a mile south-east of the town is the Telegraph Office and military barracks. Close to the town also, on the southern side, is a dry river bed, with gardens, general cultivation, wells, cocoanut and mango trees around it. A Persian doctor is Quarantine Officer. (2) Streets and Through-Routes These are non-existent, the houses being separated only by alley-ways. (3) Rail Facilities Nil. (4) Population and Labour Labour available at Chahbar :— 50 fishermen. 50 coolies. Approximately 1,000 unskilled coolies could be collected from the surrounding district. (5) Government and Municipal Establishments The Persian Army Barracks, consisting of three large one-storied buildings are situated south of the town. The Persian Posts and Telegraph building is adjacent to the barracks. The Custom House and Governor’s House are facing the shore, in the town. (6) Billeting The buildings in paragraph (5) might be utilized as billets. (7) Light and Power Nil. (8) Water There is ample supply of fresh water available from wells. These are situated near the fort to the south of the town. The water is pumped up into a reservoir from one well and laid on by pipes to the telegraph office. (9) Industrial Establishments Nil. (10) Local Agriculture and Fishing Sheep and bullocks may be obtained from the neighbouring country. Ibex may be shot on Ras Kuhlab. Fish is plentiful and turtle occasionally obtainable. A few vegetables are grown.46 (B) PORTS [Part V—continued] (11) Public Transport Services and Garages Nil. (12) Fire Service Nil. (13) Areas for Dumps and Parks There is ample space for dumps on the beaches and outside the town. HENJAM (Lat. 26° 41' N., Long. 55° 53' E.) [See Plans 5 and 5a and Admiralty Charts 3599 and 753.) (a) THE PORT (1) General Henjam is an island 5| miles long and 3| miles wide situated off the south coast of the island of Qishm, from which it is separated by a strait, Henjam sound, which is a mile wide and has 6 to 12 fathoms in the fairway. The position of Henjam—from where the Arabian coast is normally visible owing to the narrowness of the Persian Gulf at this point, gives it considerable strategic value. The barren hills of the island, which decrease in elevation from its northern, to its comparatively low southern, end are covered with coarse grass and brushwood and in colour the island is rather dark. There is a valuable anchorage off Ras-al-Masheh (Mashia) at the northern part of the island which was formerly used by H.M. Ships in the Gulf. There are no air facilities except that seaplanes could alight and take off and moor in Henjam sound in good weather but it is not suitable as a seaplane base. Approaches .—Vessels with a draught of more than 20 ft. (6 ml) entering Henjam sound from south-eastward should exercise great caution and should keep well southward of Maundrell shoal, which has a least depth of 3J fathoms (5m9) and lies about 1 mile south-eastward of Ras Khargu ; it is connected to the shoal ground southward of the point by a ridge with depths of less than 6 fathoms (11 mO). Vessels should not pass between the shoal and the coast of Qishm island. It is recommended to enter with the western edge of a conspicuous clump of trees close northward of the conspicuous stone hut, north-westward of Ras-Khargu, bearing 340° but care must be taken to alter course westward in good time to avoid the foul ground marked by the buoy southward of that point. During a Shamal it is better to approach the anchorage by the eastern, rather than the western entrance. (2) Conspicuous Objects Table hill, near the northern end of the island, rises to an elevation of 340 ft., though remarkable on some bearings, it does not show up well when seen from southward against the higher land of Qishm island ; on its summit is an inconspicuous whitewashed stone cairn 7 ft. in height. Jabal Mushi, about 3 cables northward of Table hill and separated from it by a low valley stretching from east to west across the northern end of Henjam island is 262 ft. high and on its summit is a cairn 10 ft. high. Mitre hill rises to an elevation of 344 ft. about 7 cables south-eastward of Table hill. It has a double summit, the eastern being surmounted by a large and conspicuous cairn. A beacon of concrete blocks surmounted by a staff and triangle painted white, and 25 ft in height stands near the extremity of Ras-al-Masheh (Lat. 26° 41' N., Long. 55° 54' E.).’ A wireless mast, 205 ft. in height, with four secondary masts near it stands about 31- cables south ward of the beacon. (3) Tides, Tidal Streams and Currents Eastward of Ras-al-Masheh the tidal streams set north-westward and south-eastward ■ and at times attain a rate of nearly 2^ knots. (4) Weather Winds follow the same general tendency as reported under Bandar Abbas. The anchorage is sufficiently sheltered to prevent any appreciable sea getting up and is used by dhows to shelter from the north-easterly winds prevalent in December. y (5) Anchorages There is an anchorage at Bandar Sharki north-eastward.of Ras-al-Masheh, it is sheltered from the Shamal but is not a desirable one on account of the hard bottom and the strong tidal streams and 6 QQ 16 S tnere. , , , An ° tl ] er an chorage, Bandar Gharbi, about 3 cables north-westward of Ras-al-Masheh, is partially sheltered from the Shamal which there blows from south-westward. The depths are irregular over a bottom of sand and mud, reported to be good holding ground 5[Part V — continued] (B) PORTS The best position in which to anchor is in a depth of from 7 to 9 fathoms (12 m 8 to 16 m 5) with the beacon on Ras-al-Masheh bearing not less than 124°, distant about 3 cables. It is reported that there is anchorage for five ships. A convenient berth is with the light structure on Ras-al-Masheh bearing 183°, distant 3f cables. It is reported that in the hot weather any cool wind there may be is felt and it is not laden with sand or dust. The position is open to a strong shamdl and slight sea but the holding ground is good; it cannot, however, be recommended during the winter months. An H.M. cruiser reports that anchorage in 8 fathoms was obtained in position 320° 4 cables from the flashing light on Ras-al-Masheh. In this position the holding ground is not very good (sand) but the anchorage is well sheltered from all normal winds except the shamhl and it was found that this anchorage was quite comfortable in moderate sham'al conditions. When anchoring the cruiser ran in on the white hut near the conspicuous clump of trees on the eastern shore, on a course of 090°, letting go on a bearing of the flashing light. It would not be possible to see the hut at night, but the anchorage is easy to leave in the dark either by the south-east or south west entrance. Tidal streams experienced in the above anchorage between mid-October and January were east and west at an estimated speed of 1| knots at spring tides. To the south-east of Ras-al-Masheh there are numerous eddies and overfalls, as shown on the chart. Prohibited Anchorages Anchorage is prohibited south-eastward of the pecked line indicated on the chart, joining a white stone hut, situated about half a mile south-eastward of Ras-al-Masheh, and the conspicuous stone hut north-westward of Ras Khargu. Anchorage is also prohibited south-westward of the pecked line indicated on the chart extending west-north-westward from Ras-al-Masheh. (7) Quayage, Cranage and Clearance from Quays There is one jetty 100 yards long; it is constructed of steel which has badly corroded. It has a good wooden deck. The depth of water at the steps at low water is 3 ft. The jetty requires re-building but is still serviceable for boats. Boats can also land at the north-western side of Ras A1 Masheh where the beach is moderately steep. (8) Accommodation Five ships can be accommodated in the anchorage off Bandar Sharki eastwards of Ras-al-Masheh and five at the anchorage at Bandar Gharbi to the north-westward of Ras-al-Masheh. (11) Warehouses and Stacking Space There is h fair-sized building, formerly a coal go-down and coolies’ quarters, in a state of disrepair, which could be converted into a warehouse. (12) Coal, Oil and Water Nil. (13) Docks, Slipways and Repair Facilities Nil. (15) Normal Functions of Port There is fairly frequent casual communication with Qishm Island by dhows en route to other parts. (b) THE TOWN (1) General The principal and official settlement is at Ras-al-Masheh. The controlling authority is a Lieutenant of Police. The only other officials are the Postmaster and the Customs officials. There is a telephone to Qishm Island. (4) Population and Labour Ras-al-Masheh has a population of about 80. The villages of Ghail and Henjam in the south number about 200 each. (6) Billeting The Ex-Naval Officers’ Club and buildings and offices of Cable and Wireless, Ltd., formerly used for personnel of the now disused W/T station, would provide accommodation for about 200 men. (7) Light and Power Nil. (8) Water and Sanitation There are water tanks for the collection of surface rainwater in the Ras-al-Masheh settlement; when these are dry, which is frequent, fresh water is brought from Ghail, 3 miles distant.48 (B) PORTS [Part V — continued] (10) Local Agriculture and Fishing Meat and vegetables are usually unobtainable, but supplies of fresh fish and turtle are plentiful. Excellent seine and net fishing can be had on the beaches in the vicinity of Ras-al-Masheh and oysters are plentiful on the rocks below high water mark. The inhabitants own a few date groves, goats and some pearling boats. JASK (Lat. 25° 38' N., Long. 57° 45' E.) (See Plans 12 and 12a and Admiralty Chart 145) (a) THE PORT (1) General Jask cannot strictly be described as a port. It is a small fishing village, situated in a bay on the south-east coast of Persia, facing west into the Gulf of Oman. The village lies immediately to the north of Jask Point. There is a landing ground 1£ miles east-north-east of the village, and this was used by Dutch and French airlines as a stopping place on the route to India up to 1940. At present (1945) there is a small R.A.F. unit stationed there to staff the emergency landing ground. • Jask is unsuitable as a seaplane base. # Approaches The bay is entered westward of Cape Jask ; its shore is composed of sand hills from 10 to 20 ft. high. Mason Shoal, about 3 miles west-south-west of Cape Jask, has at least 2f fathoms and is coarse sand and shells. A flat, over which there are depths of from 2^ to 3 fathoms, extends about 2 miles north-westward of Cape Jask. A red buoy, surrounded by a cage, lies near the north-western extremity of the flat. Jask Creek, about 3| miles north-north-eastward of Cape Jask, is entered by a channel through the sands, about 1^ ft. in depth at the entrance but with greater depths inside. Owing to the bar it can only be entered at high tide and then only by craft drawing not more than about 6 ft. (2) Conspicuous Objects On the point of Cape Jask there is a small tomb, 15 ft. high, close to which are two dark flat- topped buildings. A light is exhibited, at an elevation of 37 ft., from a white round tower on the northern corner of a small square stone house, 22 ft. in height, about 2 cables northward of the Point. There are two conspicuous square towers on the telegraph buildings about 4 cables north-eastward of the Cape. (3) Tides, Tidal streams and Currents Between Cape Jask and Ras-al-Kuh, about 26 miles west-north-westward, the tidal streams off the coast set eastward and westward. Near the Cape the stream is weak increasing slightly further north. In December 1922, H.M.S. “ Espiegle ” experienced a strong set in the channel between the Cape and Mason Shoal, though outside the channel the stream was weak. Ordinary spring tides rise about 1\ ft. (4) Weather The anchorage is partially exposed to the south-west monsoon from May to October. Warning of the approach of a shamal may often be obtained at the telegraph office where information is received of the commencement of one at Bushire. (5) Anchorages A convenient anchorage may be obtained by vessels drawing up to 16 ft. in a depth of 3| fathoms, with Cape Jask Lighthouse bearing 173° distant about 12 cables., Larger vessels anchor further out in a depth of 4| fathoms with the lighthouse bearing 153° distant about 2 miles. The distance to the shore is about 1,000 yards. (6) Description of Harbour The foreshore by the Custom House, H cables north of the telegraph buildings, is gradually shelving sand. There is another shelving sandy beach running north-east from Cape Jask. When shelter is required for unloading in bad weather, local shallow draught craft can at high water, enter Jask Creek which winds through the mangrove swamps for about 4 miles.[Part V — continued'] (B) PORTS (7) Quayage, Cranage and Clearance of Quays There are no quays or cranes. Unloading is by dhow lighter from ships to the beach and all merchandise is manhandled by local coolie labour. There is a small stone jetty in Jask Creek, about 1 mile from the R.A.F. camp, but this is only available for local craft entering at high water. All unloading is necessarily slow. (9) Harbour Craft Four dhows are available, approximate capacity being 20 tons each. These are owned by Sayed Mohd. Saleh, who is the B.I. agent. No difficulty is experienced in obtaining these dhows, but it is thought that further craft are not readily available. (10) Landing of Men, Stores and Vehicles by Water Transport Men and stores could be disembarked easily on the beaches and M.T. landed from landing craft. (11) Warehouses and Stacking Space Warehouse accommodation is extremely limited. (12) Coal, Oil and Water There are no coal or fuel stocks. Water is not available for boilers. (13) Docks, Slipways and Repair Facilities Nil. (14) Facilities for Clearing the Port Area Rail—Nil. There are no roads, but caravan tracks lead to Bandar Abbas and Chahbar. (15) Normal Functions of Port The only export is dried fish manure to India. Imports include rice, tea, flour, sugar, grain, timber and cloth. In peace time the B.I. northbound and southbound slow mails call once a week. Dhows trading between Gulf ports and India make infrequent calls. (16) Estimated Daily Capacity Very small, probably not more than 30 tons per day, depending on availability of labour and craft. i (b) THE TOWN (1) General Jask village, in which is a stone fort, extends about 1 mile north-eastward along the shore of the bay, from a position about half-a-mile north-north-eastward of the Cape. The fort is in a ruinous condition with a few houses and date palms near it, and a range of white sandhills south-eastward of it ; it is not easily identified from seaward. Cable and Wireless Ltd., had a cable station here until 1937 and the principal buildings are still in existence, also the three large blocks of the Telegraph Station 4 cables north-east of Cape Jask. Two W/T masts 140 ft. high are situated close to these buildings. Up to 1940 Jask was of some slight importance as a refuelling airfield for Dutch and French airlines. The whole village and area now present the most desolate appearance. (2) Streets and Through-Routes The streets are narrow and unpaved. (3) Rail Facilities Nil. (4) Population and Labour The population is now only about 1,200. About 250 coolies are usually available for unloading if notice is given. (5) Government and Municipal Establishments The former Cable and Wireless buildings are now partially occupied by the Persian Posts and Telegraphs. During the war (1939-1945) this was controlled by an Indian Army signal unit. There is a Deputy Governor living in the village whose clerk officiates when the Deputy Governor is on leave. There is also a Collector of Customs and Chief of Police. (6) Billeting There are few houses suitable for billets, but the Telegraph buildings could doubtless be utilised. (7) Light and Power Nil. (C58272) F50 (B) PORTS [Part V — continued] (8) Water and Sanitation Water is obtained from local wells and tanks but is not abundant. (9) Industrial Establishments Nil. (10) Local Agriculture and Fishing Fresh meat and bread can be obtained in small quantities, but no vegetables. Fish is plentiful. (11) Public Transport Services and Garages Nil. (12) Fire Service Nil. (13) Areas for Dumps and Parks Convenient dumps can be made on the beaches or near the stone jetty in Jask Creek. KHORRAMSHAHR (Lat. 30° 251'., Long. 47° 10' E.) (See Plans 13 and 13a and Admiralty Chart 3845.) (a) THE PORT (1) General Khorramshahr is situated on the left bank of the Shatt-al-Arab near the junction with the Karun river, 67 miles above the outer bar of the Shatt-al-Arab in the Persian Gulf (Rooka Channel) and 21 miles below Basra (Margil Docks). The port is divided into two parts :— (a) The recently developed port on the Shatt-al-Arab situated ^ mile above the junction of the Karun river, and (b) The Old Port, situated about ^ mile within the entrance of the Hafar channel (generally called the Karun) which joins the Karun river to the Shatt-al-Arab. Until the construction of Bandar Shapur, Khorramshahr was the main port for the western part of Persia but in recent years had been allowed to fall into decay. The Old Port, having proved inadequate to handle any great amount of traffic, it was decided that a new jetty should be built in the Shatt-al-Arab to handle vessels which had previously been lightered in mid-stream. During the tenure of the Allied Forces in Persia the jetty and port facilities were greatly extended, and a railway line was built connecting the Port with the Trans-Iranian Railway at Ahwaz. An M.T. Ferry operated by the Army, crosses the Karun between Khorranshahr and Abadan. It is situated directly opposite the main office of the A.I.O.C. in Khorramshahr. Its capacity is seven vehicles including not more than two of 30 cwt. In 1944 a boat bridge was constructed on the Karun miles above the junction with the Shatt-al-Arab, this bridge is dismantled during the flood season (March-April). It is expected that the A.I.O.C. will endeavour to keep this bridge (or a similar one) in being since it affords direct communication between Abadan and the main road from Khorramshahr and Ahwaz. Khorramshahr is a good naval base for small ships but with no docking facilities, and only one boat slip. Until its occupation by British forces in August 1941, it was used as a base for the Persian navy. During the war (1939-1945) it was used as a naval and minesweeping base for the Shatt-al-Arab. Early in 1945, Khorramshahr became the only Persian Gulf port used for the forwarding of supplies for Russia, arrangements having been made to close the port of Bandar Shapur, formerly used for this purpose, the Persian assets there being handed back to Persian control. Until the end of 1935, Khorramshahr was known as'Mohammerah. Approaches Hafar channel, an artificial channel usually known as the Karun, connects that river with the Shatt-al-Arab. The Karun is a deep-water river sheltered from the prevailing winds. No regular dredging is necessary to keep the port open other than at Rooka channel. The Karun bar extends from about ^ mile above Hartheh Point to just below the junction of Hafar channel with the main channel about 3 miles northward. Except in the flood season the least depth over the Karun bar is usually about 19 ft. (5 m. 8). The track across the bar varies considerably, especially at the beginning of the flood season, March or April, ‘when very rapid alterations in the channel may be expected. As these alterations, prevent the establishment of permanent leading marks, light buoys, which are moved as necessary, are employed to mark the channel.[Part V — continued] (B) PORTS Two lights are exhibited near the south-eastern extremity of Umal Khasasif or Dabbah Island, about 2\ miles above Hartheh Point. At all times when the bar is in an unsettled condition a surveying vessel is stationed there to check the depths and where necessary a special pilot boards inward-bound vessels in the vicinity of Hartheh Point to conduct them across the bar. Numerous surveying marks are maintained on either bank of the river. (2) Conspicuous Objects On the southern side of the entrance to the Hafar channel there is a conspicuous statue of H.I.M. Riza Khan, the late Shah of Persia, and a flagstaff close north-eastward of it, on the southern side of the entrance to the channel, also a water tower 40 ft. in height. On the northern side of the entrance there is a wharf, also the Custom House, and the British Consulate, which is situated \ mile along the bank of the Karun. (3) Tides, Tidal Streams and Currents The Karun river enters the eastern end of the Hafar channel, the main volume of its water flowing through that channel into the Shatt-al-Arab, the remainder turning south-eastward into the Bahmanshir river. The rate of the stream in a high river is from 4 to 6 knots and in a low river about 2 knots. The river is reported to rise sometimes as much as 20 ft. (6*1 m.) between January and March, due to very heavy rains up country, but such rises subside so quickly that advantage cannot be taken of them for navigational purposes. The tide is felt 30 miles above the entrance. In the anchorage in the Shatt-al-Arab at Khorramshahr there is 30 ft. of water at M.L.W. height of spring rise is 8 ft. and neap rise 4 ft. The heights of both high and low water are considerably affected by prevailing weather conditions. Northerly winds tend to keep tides low and southerly winds have the opposite effect. Spring floods raise the water level 2 to 3 ft. In the Shatt-al-Arab the highest levels occur in May, June and July when the river is discharging the combined flood waters of the Euphrates and Tigris. The lowest levels occur in October and November. In Rooka channel, the streams set fairly through the channel except at spring tides when at either end there is a strong northerly set on the ingoing stream, and a strong southerly set on the outgoing stream ; at neap tides these cross currents are inappreciable. The maximum rate of the ingoing stream, which at springs is from 1-| to 2 knots and at neaps from 1 to 1J knots, occurs at about half-tide. The maximum rate of the outgoing stream is from 3 to 3^ knots at springs and from 2 to 2J knots at neaps. At spring tides, the ingoing stream continues to flow for about 40 minutes after the time of high water ; at neaps it is irregular, but usually continues for about one hour after high water. The outgoing stream continues for about 30 minutes after low water at springs, and for about one hour after low water at neaps. H.M.S. “ Triad,” in 1931, reported that'the observed direction of the surface stream is not a reliable guide, for, when anchored below the control vessel, she swung to the ingoing stream, about two hours after the time of low water, whilst an outgoing stream with a rate of 2 knots continued to run past her. Caution is therefore necessary as, if when turning into Rooka channel, allowance is made for an observed outgoing stream, it may be. that the sub-surface ingoing stream is already making, which might easily put a vessel on to the bank. Rooka channel was dredged in 1938, to a depth of 23 ft. (7-0 m.) at M.L.W.S. and two suction dredgers are continuously operated by the Basra Port Directorate. (4) Weather Prevailing weather conditions affect the height of both high and low water in the Shatt-al-Arab. Northerly winds tend to keep tides low and southerly winds have the opposite effect. Spring floods raise the water level 2 to 3 ft. In the rare cases of southerly storms difficulty might be experienced in berthing vessels, while lightering from vessels in midstream would be restricted. (5) Anchorages The Shatt-al-Arab at Khorramshahr has anchorage space for five ships drawing 29 ft. and not over 410 ft. in length. There are four sets of buoys. Ships awaiting discharge moor at Nahr-abu-al-Flus, 8 miles upstream, or at Hartheh Point, 3| miles downstream. It is reported that the largest vessel that is known to have entered the Karun had a draught of 17 ft. There appears, however, to be little record of soundings. Messrs. Gray Mackenzie are of the opinion that the draught of vessels able to enter the Karun river is more in the region of 14 ft. Prohibited Anchorage Anchorage in the entrance to and within the first 2 miles of the Karun as indicated by pecked lines on the chart, is prohibited owing to the existence of telegraph cables. (6) Description of Harbour The new deep water berths lie along the Shatt-al-Arab, J mile above its junction with th^, Kaiun river. They are a continuation of the previously existing Santab jetty. To the north-west there is Failiyeh creek where lighters discharge.52 (B) PORTS [Part V — continued] The naval base is situated at the junction of the Karun river with the Shatt-al-Arab on the south bank. There are six wooden jetties in the Karun and one metal boat jetty running into the Shatt-al- Arab. The small wooden boat jetties of the old port of Khorramshahr (previously called Mohammerah) are on the north bank of the Karun opposite the naval base. The Customs jetty is on the right bank of the Karun about 500 ft. from the junction of the Karun with the Shatt-al-Arab. A lighterage quay extends from the jetty. Depths as given in April, 19^3, in a report from G.H.Q. Paiforce were as follows : In the Karun, 15 ft.-28 ft. ; in the Shatt-al-Arab, 34 ft. ; at the junction of the Karun and the Shatt-al-Arab, 40 ft.-60 ft. Ships lying at the berths in the Shatt-al-Arab discharge direct into railway wagons on the quay. Ships lying in the stream can be discharged by lighters which use the lighterage quays. (7) Quayage, Cranage and Clearance from Quays The original Santab wharf is situated on the Shatt-al-Arab upstream of the Karun river entrance. It is 410 ft. long and 50 ft. wide. This jetty is constructed of concrete. The deck is supported by reinforced concrete trusses which are supported by rows of reinforced concrete piles driven along each side of the jetty. The maximum carrying capacity is not known but the jetty has carried a load of 700 lb. per sq. ft. and at one time a total of 550 tons. The deck is 9 ft. above M.L.T. and 4 ft above M.H.T. Upstream of, and adjoining the Santab wharf there are six additional berths formed by a wooden .jetty 60 ft. wide, built out into the stream on piles. The total deep water quayage on the Shatt-al-Arab has a frontage of 900 metres (2,950 ft.) Depth of water alongside quays is 30 ft. (August, 1944). Lighter Berths At Failiyeh creek, which is situated 2 miles upstream from the Santab wharf, the left bank has been revetted to form a wharf with 1,000 ft. of frontage for discharging barges. Five barges of 90 ft. length and with a draught of not more than 3 ft. at low water can berth alongside simultaneously. Downstream of the Santab wharf there is a sheet piled lighterage wharf 1,000 ft. long. Barges are floated in at high tide and placed alongside the concrete wall and left high and dry at low water. The wharf will accommodate four barges of 3 ft. 6 in. draught. At the Naval Base, in the Karun river, there are six “ T ” jetties built of wood and numbered 1 to 6 from the river mouth, and one (No. 7) of all welded steel construction running into the Shatt-al- Arab. Details are as follows :— No. Least Depth. Width. Length. Berth Length. » Height above Datum. M.L.W. F.A.O. 1 2 ft. 6 in. 6 ft. 62J ft. _ 11 ft. 2 13 ft. — 68 ft. 52 ft. 11 ft. 3 16 ft. 12 ft. 68 ft. 52 ft. 11 ft. 4 14 ft. 9 ft. 68 ft. 52 ft. 11 ft. 5 16 ft. 18 ft. 68 ft. 52 ft. 11 ft. 6 16 ft. 15 ft. 68 ft. 52 ft. 11 ft. 7 2 ft. — 213 ft. 9 ft. 6 in. ID ft. 4 in. The Customs landing jetty is situated on the right bank of the Karun, 500 ft. from the junction of that river with the Shatt-al-Arab. A lighterage wharf extends 275 ft. downstream from the landing jetty. There are also five jetties for motor boats on the right bank and one on the left. Oiling Berth The A.I.O.C. has a fuelling jetty on the right bank of the Karun for river boats. The jetty is constructed of steel with concrete deck 50 ft. long connecting with the river bank. Depth ot water at low tide, 8 ft. Cranes The crane position is constantly altering but in December, the port :— Mobile .. .. .. 6 by 5 by 1 by 2 by 7 by 4 by 7 by 4 by 7 by 1943, the following cranes were in 11 ton. 5 ton. 3 ton. 28 ton. 8 ton. 5 ton. 3| ton. 3 ton. 1| ton.

Note .—The above cranes were part of the equipment of the port during the “ Aid to Russia ” period. Rail and Road Facilities A railway trestle approach constructed of timber connects the Santab jetty with the railway station and stacking area. Three lines of standard gauge rail run along the Santab jetty and the wharves on the Shatt-al- Arab. The wharves are also served by separate vehicular approaches. A double line of rails runs along Failiyeh creek. The berths in the Karun are also rail served but the jetties are not connected by rail. Clearance from the Customs quay is by M.T. only. Lighting Electricity is supplied by overhead power line from Abadan, passing by submarine cable under the Karun. All requirements for electric lighting and power are supplied by A.I.O.C. The supply covers the wharves on the Shatt-al-Arab, Failiyeh creek, and the dumps. It was reported (March, 1946) that there was no electricity (on which the water supply is dependent) at the Naval Base. (8) Accommodation The deep water berths on the Shatt-al-Arab can take seven ships at a time. There are six berths of 500 ft. by 60 ft. having a total frontage of 900 metres (2,950 ft.). Vessels of 29 ft. draught can proceed alongside the wharf. In the Karun there are six wooden jetties originally for the use of the Persian navy. (For dimensions see (7) above.) At Khorramshahr the Shatt-al-Arab has anchorage space for five ships drawing 29 ft. with a length of not more than 410 ft. Ships awaiting discharge moor at Nahr Abu A1 Flus, 8 miles upstream, or at Hartheh point, 4 miles downstream. (9) Harbour Craft Usually there are numerous large mahailas (dhow-shaped barges) and small bellums (large canoes) which are used for cargo and passengers. Approximate numbers are 60 mahailas and 150 bellums ; these figures continually vary, but details may be obtained from Messrs. Gray Mackenzie’s local agent. One refrigeration barge of 160 tons (which owing to arrangements for refrigeration can only take about 80 tons of cargo) plies between Ahwaz and Khorramshahr. I.W.T. is obtainable from Abadan. (10) Landing of Men, Stores and Vehicles Troops, stores and vehicles can be landed from vessels lying at the deep water quays and by lighters from vessels anchored in the Shatt-al-Arab. Locomotives and other heavy cargoes can be discharged at Failiyeh creek where a 100-ton derrick, the property of the A.I.O.C. has been erected. The Customs area in the Karun (Old Port) is normally reserved for civil traffic, but could, in cases of need, be used for army traffic discharging from lighters and barges. (11) Warehouses and Stacking Space Unlimited storage area is available at the Khorramshahr railway station and at the railway yards 1 mile back from the Santab jetty. The area is unpaved, but the sand and oil surface is good except during heavy rain. The majority of godowns are served by branch railway lines. Storage areas on the Shatt-al-Arab front are limited, no space is available along the bund but there is space for 5,000 tons of general cargo behind the deep water berths. The Customs area affords stacking space for 10,000 tons of general cargo and is served by road and a 2 ft. gauge hand wagon rail. There are five closed brick warehouses of about 940 sq. ft. each and several smaller ones of a total of 2,400 sq. yards. The load must not exceed 7 tons per sq. yard. At the naval base (Old Port) in the Karun there is a lock-up Naval storehouse having 24 divisions and floor space of 7,500 sq. ft. There is also a minesweeping store with floor space of 5,500 sq. ft. (12) Coal, Oil and Water Coal .—500 tons of coal are normally available. Oil .—Ships take in fuel oil at Abadan where unlimited supplies are available. Diesel oil for use in the naval base power house is brought from Abadan by lorry or barge. A 90-ton barge is available for this purpose. There is a steel tank adjacent to the power house which contains enough oil to maintain the power supply for the naval base for approximately two months.54 (B) PORTS [Part V — continued] The A.I.O.C. maintains an oil depot for Karun river craft, which is situated | mile up the river. Stocks maintained are :— Kerosene .. .. .. .. 10,000 gallons. Gas Oil .. .. .. .. 20,000 gallons. Fuel Oil .. .. .. .. 165,000 gallons. Delivery rate is 3,000 gallons per hour through a 3-in. connection. Water. —Eight storage tanks of 50,000 gallons each for the supply of water for engines and boilers and to provide fire protection are situated at the wharf. Drinking Water—The port area is dependent on a British plant. This is a 600,000 (Imperial) G.P.O. plant. There are also two 40,000 G.P.O. plants belonging to the A.I.O.C. which can feed the mains in an emergency. There is a 40,000 G.P.O. plant belonging to the American hospital which is also used as an auxiliary supply during summer. The naval base is well provided with water facilities. Water for the naval base area is obtained direct from the Karun and pumped to a steel settling tank (24 ft. by 24 ft. by 4 ft. 6 in.). The water is drawn off by electric pumps and passed through a sand filter and chlorinator and thence to an overhead tank about 40 ft. above ground level with a capacity of about 10,000 cu. ft. Water is then distributed throughout the base and is available on the Karun jetties for ships’ supply. (13) Docks, Slipways and Repair Facilities There are no docks or main slipways. Slipping is done at Abadan or Basra. A small slip suitable for 110 ft. M.L.s was partially constructed at the naval base, but has never been completed or used. The naval base (Old Port) is more or less self-contained as regards repair works. There is a workshop containing the following facilities :— Power Supply Three Diesel engines, belt coupled to generators each of 3 phase. 50 N type, 240 volts, 107 amps, at 1,000 r.p.m. and unity power factor, with self excited compound wound exciters direct coupled to generators, 65 volts, 22 amps. One M.G. set for D.C. supply of ships alongside comprising one slipping 3 phase. 50 N direct coupled to D.C. generator, 110 volts, 300 amps. One Diesel generator set, 110 volts, D.C., 45 amps. One petrol generator set, 240 volts, D.C., 25 amps. One petrol generator set, 220 volts, D.C., 8*5 amps. Two battery charging boards. Machines in Shop One multispeed head capstan lathe with three heads. Power driven variable speed traverse. Individual drive (A.C. Squirrel cage motor, P.B., D.O.L. starting).

One hydraulic test pump up to 5 kg., cm. Four Oxy-acetylene cutters with alternative welding heads, 25 bottles, two acetylene plants. Carpenter’s Shop One belt-driven lathe One dual planer. These two machines are driven from A.C. S.C. motor, P.B. D.O.L. starting. Note. The present condition of much of this machinery is problematical as this list was before the R.N. evacuated the base in June, 1945. At the naval base there is office accommodation consisting of 12 good offices in two and living accommodation for approx. 150 ratings and 30 officers and sick quarters. A workshop is situated on the Santab wharf for the repair and maintenance of cargo gear, pumps and minor engineering works. 6 compiled buildings handling55 [Part V — continued'] (B) PORTS (14) Facilities for Clearing Port Area Clearance is effected by railway, road and barge (up the Karun river to Ahwaz). Railway The railway connects the port with the Trans-Iranian railway at Ahwaz (80 miles). It consists of a single standard gauge track lying on a dirt gravel ballasted bed and is approximately level the whole distance. There are six small bridges with a maximum span of 12 ft. There are two sidings at 41 km and 42 km. Each siding is 100 metres long and supplied with underground water tanks of 200 cubic metres capacity. Every 10 km there is a section gang post. At Khorramshahr station, 1 mile behind the docks, is the railway yard, with four connecting tracks each about 700 metres long, and two dead-end tracks about 360 metres long. There are adequate watering facilities. Railway repairs are undertaken at Ahwaz. Road Roads run to Ahwaz, Abadan, Andimeshk and Basra ; these have metalled surfaces which were laid in 1943 and 1944 and up to 1945 could be graded as 1st class. Water The Karun river is used for transportation by barge as far as Ahwaz. The navigable draught at dead low water for steamers should not exceed 3 ft. and for barges 2 ft. 9 in. Up to Bandar Masiri, the commencement of the rapids, 1^ miles below Ahwaz, the Karun is in most parts and in ordinary seasons navigable by a vessel of 5 or even 6 ft. draught. Vessels of 12 ft. draught can reach Sulamania bend, 14 miles above Khorramshahr. (15) Normal Functions of Port Normally, the port is used as the base for the Persian Navy. Until the construction of Bandar Shapur, Khorramshahr was the principal port for the western part of Persia and the entrepot for the foreign trade of Khuzistan. Civil traffic for the 36 months from April, 1938, to March, 1941, showed an average of 5,400 tons in and 2,980 tons out, per month. (16) Estimated Capacity 3,000 tons per day approx. The estimated rate of discharge of the berths in the Shatt-al-Arab is 400 tons per berth per day. Discharge at Failiyeh Creek is estimated at 500 tons daily. Tonnage landed ex ship and barge in December, 1944, amounted to 99,706 tons, a decrease of 11,787 tons compared with the previous month. Clearance from port was as follows :— Rail. Road. Total. Dec., 1944. Jan., 1945. Dec., 1944. Jan., 1945. Dec., 1944. Jan., 1945. 109,590 102,454 32,653 36,603 142,243 139,057 The difference between landed and clearance tonnage is accounted for by P.O.L. emanating from plants at Khorramshahr and Abadan. (b) THE TOWN (1) General The town of Khorramshahr, on the north bank of the Karun river, was formerly administered by the Sheik of Mohammerah under the sovereignty of the Persian Government. He was removed in 1925 and since then the administration has been carried out by the Persian Civil Governor who is directly under the Governor-General of Khusistan. The native port, at one time the most important port at the top of the Persian Gulf, declined in importance with the construction of Bandar Shapur which was connected with the hinterland by railway and the use of which was encouraged by the late Shah at the expense of Khorramshahr. The port remained, however, the base of the Persian Navy. To the west of the town are European buildings owned by the A.I.O.C. and occupied by A.I.O.C. employees and Government officials. On the south bank of the river are the Persian naval barracks and administrative buildings. Provisions Limited quantities of fresh foods, vegetables according to season, mutton, fish and fowl are available locally. Wheat is under Government control. Sugar and tea are expensive and difficult to obtain in quantity. Dates are plentiful. Tinned stores are not obtainable. There is also a very small margin over the actual needs of the population so that demands for victualling must be small. There is no cold storage. (C58272) F 256 (B) PORTS [P^t V — continued] Hospitals During the British occupation, sick quarters were maintained at the naval base. There was also a British army hospital and first aid station and a U.S. army (80 beds) hospitalJMarch, 1944). All serious cases of illness or accident are transported to the A.I.O.C. hospital at Abadan. Malaria is prevalent at all times of the year. (2) Streets and Through'Routes The town itself is of the usual pattern of mud buildings, having narrow streets. There are a few modern buildings. (3) Rail Facilities The railway station and railway yards are 1 mile north of the Santab jetty. Coal and oil for locomotives are available at the railway station. The coal stacked there is the responsibility of Transportation Stores, Ahwaz (1944). Oil is supplied from Ahwaz in an oil tank wagon. Repairs are carried out at Ahwaz. Locomotives are oil fired. (4) Population and Labour Khorramshahr town has a population of 4,500. The district has a population of about 12,000. The maximum native labour supply is 7,000 provided by local contractors. (5) Government and Municipal Establishments The Naval Base and workshop. The Persian Naval Barracks and administrative buildings are on the south bank of the Karun. To the west of the town are European buildings owned by the A.I.O.C. and occupied by A.I.O.C. employees and Government officials. The Custom House, the quarantine station and doctors’ quarters are at the junction of the Karun with the Shatt-al-Arab. The British Consulate is near the Custom House with the British cemetery not far distant. Telephone Exchange There is a 20-line magneto-dry battery exchange. Outside direct connection is with Abadan exchange from which the following exchanges can be reached :—Basra (public exchange), Ahwaz, Fields, Bandar Shapur, Mashur. Any number on the Persian State telephones can be obtained by ringing the Postmaster, Khorramshahr 815, or the Postmaster, Abadan 295, who will pass any messages by telegraph or telephone where possible. All telephones in the base are maintained by the A.I.O.C. telephone engineer whose number is 6071. (6) Billeting There are some billeting facilities in the A.I.O.C. buildings and in the town, but in the latter the sanitation is primitive. Recreation Facilities A limited number of officers can become service members of the English club, which is on the north bank of the Karun river opposite the naval base and which is served by a ferry service. The club caters for most leisure-time pursuits. There is a small library, also billiard tables, etc., and in the attached grounds two hard tennis courts. Nearby is the club’s private swimming pool complete with “ refreshments.” In the naval compound officers can avail themselves of the swimming bath, a tennis court (one court reserved for officers) and the open-air cinema. Ratings can make use of the swimming pool, cinema, tennis courts and cricket and football grounds. Indoor games such as billiards, darts, etc., can be played in the canteen and beer garden. (7) Light and Power Road lighting is supplied by the A.I.O.C., Abadan through a sub-station situated a few hundred yards upstream of the naval base. 8 9 (8) Water and Sanitation Water for the town is obtained direct from the Karun river where it is plentiful and good but should be boiled before drinking. Water from the wells is brackish and not suitable for drinking Sanitation except for the A.I.O.C. buildings is mostly pripiitive. (9) Industrial Establishments The A.I.O.C. oil depot and barelling plant and a bitumen plant, also owned by the A.I.O.C. There is a storage tank of 50,000 gallons capacity and a drum repair shed and a concrete, platform of 29,000 sq. ft. for drum storage, also a 1-ton Morris crane for handling. The drums are moved on a Decauville track. The bitumen which is brought up from Abadan, is used in road construction,57 [Part V — continued^ (B) PORTS The Karun Navigation Company which operates barges on the Khorramshahr-Ahwaz route. The barges use mud berths. Messrs. Frank Strick &amp; Co. and Messrs. Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co. have offices in the town. There is a branch of the Imperial Bank of Iran. (10) Local Agriculture and Fishing Dates are plentiful. Limited quantities of fresh foods, vegetables according to season, mutton, fish and fowl are available locally. Wheat is under Government control. (11) Fire Service There are eight storage tanks of 50,000 gallons each, which are situated at the wharves, water from which can be used for fire protection. A central fire station has been set up by the Military Authorities and consists of the following equipment. 2 by 500 G.P.M. fire trucks. 12 trailer pumps (500 G.P.M.). 20 by 34 gallon chemical fire extinguishers. 150 by 21 gallon chemical fire extinguishers. (12) Areas for Dumps and Parks Near the railway station. LINGEH (Lat. 26° 35' N., Long. 54° 55' E.) (Admiralty Chart 2837A.) (a) THE PORT (1) General Lingeh is the seat of the Deputy Governor of the Gulf ports. Other officials are the Collector of Customs, the Chief of Police, the Port and Medical Officers and other minor officials. The town and port occupy a narrow strip of foreshore. The surrounding country consists of a sandy desert with scattered date groves. 5 miles inland hills rise to 1,000 ft. There are two aerodromes, one is an old emergency landing ground situated 2 miles north-east of the town and can be used only for very light aircraft, the other is the new aerodrome situated 3| miles west-south-west of the town which could be used by most medium sized aircraft. There is no suitable anchorage for seaplanes except in calm weather. There is a British Consular agency in the town. Approaches Close outside the anchorage there are depths of 7 and 8 fathoms in the gut and at about \\ miles off shore the depths decrease again to 5 fathoms. (2) Conspicuous Objects In the forenoon the town usually shows up well from seaward. The Deputy Governor’s house on the sea-front is conspicuous. At the south-western end of the town a conspicuous tall minaret, its upper part of grey and green bricks with a dark green roof, shows up well against the light-coloured land behind it. There are also two wireless masts about 110 ft. in height situated about ^ mile inland near the northern end of the town. Outside the town there are many birkehs, or circular domed water reservoirs. (3) Tides, Tidal Streams and Currents Off Lingeh, the tidal streams set south-westward and north-westward at a rate of from J to f knot. Ordinary spring tides rise lb ft. (4) Weather In November, a moderate north-easterly wind, force 4, with a slight sea has been experienced. It is believed that the Shamal blows from a westerly direction at Lingeh. (5) Anchorages Anchorage may be obtained in a depth of 5 fathoms, clay, and good holding ground, at about £ mile offshore abreast the town. Small craft anchor about 3 cables farther in, in depths of about 4 fathoms. , , . . , The anchorage is sheltered, except from the Suhaili, which sends m a heavy sea, but this wind is always of short duration. ._ » x „ rrr , An H.M. cruiser has obtained anchorage in position 140 1-42 miles from the east W/T mast with good holding ground (clay). . . Shias bay about 4\ miles to the south-westward of Lingeh also affords good anchorage in depths of 5 to 7 fathoms. It is sheltered from the Shamal, and the Nashi does not raise a heavy sea as Qishm island and the Flat affords a certain amount of protection.58 (B) PORTS [Part V — continued] (6) Description of Harbour There are only two small boat harbours which can be used by small boats except at low .water when they dry out. There is a good sandy beach which shelves fairly steeply and has no rocks. It begins 1 mile south-west, from the Custom House, and extends in that direction for about 1 mile towards Ras Khargu. Cars, etc., can be landed here from dhows. A similar beach exists in Shias Bay about miles to the sbuth-westward. (7) Quayage, Cranage and Clearance from Quays There are no quays or jetties but there are two cambers both of which dry out at low water. [a] The camber to the north-east of the Custom House which has a wharf-frontage of 120 ft. and a depth of 6 ft. at high water. (b) The camber opposite the Custom House which is only suitable for small dhows and boats. There are no cranes, but a hoist of up to 1 ton can be man handled on to the wharf from dhow lighters. A motor car could not be removed from the wharf owing to the very narrow shore approaches. (9) Harbour Craft One dhow lighter of 30 tons capacity and several smaller dhows are available for handling cargo. (10) Landing of Men, Stores and Vehicles by Water Transport Troops and stores could be disembarked and landed but not rapidly. (11) Warehouses and Stacking Space Warehouses, nil. Goods could be stacked on the beaches. (12) Coal, Oil and Water There are no coal or fuel oil stocks. Water is not available for boilers. (13) Docks, Slipways and Repair Facilities Nil. (14) Facilities for Clearing Port Area Rail. —-Nil. Road .—There is a good track via Bastak and Lar to Shiraz (250 miles). From Lingeh to Bastak, it is impossible for cars and only just usable beyond that. The caravan^ track along the coast to Bushire (350 miles) is possible for cars in dry weather. (15) Normal Functions of Port Exports are carpets, goat hides, gum arabic, nuts, shark fins (to Hong Kong) and oyster shells in small quantities. ' Imports consist of rice, tea, flour, grain, timber and cloth. In normal times, B.I. slow mail steamers call once a fortnight from each direction. Motor and sailing coasting dhows call and ocean-going dhows from Rung, 7 miles to the north-west, trade with Lingeh and other gulf ports and do one trip a year to Aden and East Africa. (16) Estimated Daily Capacity Very small, probably 50-100 tons, depending on availability of labour and craft. (b) THE TOWN (1) General Lingeh is a town of the usual Arab type, extending for about 1 mile along the coast, the Custom House being in the centre. Formerly it had a flourishing pearl fishing industry and 25 years ago it had a population of about 25,000, but this has now fallen to about 3,000 and consequently the town is largely deserted or in ruins and trade is nearly at a standstill. Lingeh is connected to the general telegraph system—there is a low power W/T station [see (5) below). There is no hospital, but the Persian Government run a small dispensary. Drugs are provided by the Persian Government. Some supplies can be obtained including small quantities of beef of poor quality, mutton and vegetables. Duck, bustard and sand-grouse can be shot during the winter months, but it is necessary to travel a few miles inland. (2) Streets and Through Routes The streets are very narrow. (3) Rail Facilities Nil.(B) PORTS \Part V — continued] (4) Population and Labour The population is now only about 3,000. (5) Government and Municipal Establishments There is a low power W/T station (call sign EPO) which works short point-to-point routines with Bushire and Jask on 6,350 kc/s. It has two kw. dynamos for battery charging. (8) Water and Sanitation Water supply normally relies on a number of surface rain-water storage tanks built under dome shaped roofs and known as “ Birkehs.” At certain times most of these are dry and the inhabitants rely on water from wells dug round the town for irrigation purposes. Neither of these sources is considered fit for Europeans. Sanitation is non-existent. (9) Industrial Establishments Messrs. Gray Mackenzie have an office next to the Custom House. There is an A.I.O.C. agency. 10 (10) Local Agriculture and Fishing Dates and vegetables are grown in the neighbourhood. Beef of poor quality and mutton can be obtained. Fishing is reported to be good.60 (A) COAST [Part V — continued'] THE CASPIAN SEA (A) COAST THE COASTLINE These remarks are confined to the Persian coastline on the Caspian from Astara on the west to the Atrek River on the east—a distance of 350 miles. Until recently Pahlevi was the chief port but lately, by reason of certain improvements that have been undertaken there, Bandar Shah has been converted into the most important of the Persian Caspian ports. A new harbour has been constructed at Naushahr near Chalus. (For descriptions of ports see (B) PORTS.) That part of Persia which borders the southern Caspian is of a totally distinct character from any other part of the country. It is verdant and damp, backed in parts by pine forests, with patches of thick jungle and capable of great fertility. It comprises the provinces of Gilan (with Resht as its principal town) and Mazanderan (principal town, Sari) and, at the south-east corner, Asterabad (principal town Gurgan) a province bleaker and less hospitable. Model towns and villages have been built at Ramsar, Chalus, Naushah and Babolsar and the principal towns have been modernised. An ambitious scheme of road communications was built up by the ex-Shah with a view to making this area a “ Persian Riviera,” and to facilitate the Shah’s visits to his estates and the export of their produce. The general character of the terrain is a narrow coastal plain backed by a noble succession of forest-clad mountains. The Tallish Mountains in the west merge into the Elburz ranges which are themselves a continuation of the Lesser Caucasus, and continue eastwards to the Hindu Kush. This mighty system is cleft only by a single river, the Qizil Uzon (Sefid Rud) which debouches into the sea east of Resht. Although the southern slopes of the Elburz range facing the Iranian plateau, are barren and treeless, the northern slopes are covered with forest and thick vegetation right down to the point where they vanish into the plain. This plain itself is diverse in character, varying from open heath (which is uncommon) to impassable jungle. Except for the large re-entrant near Resht, which is extensively cultivated with tea, mulberry and poplar, most of it is low scrub (sometimes marshy) thick woodland, or rice cultivation. The rice fields are wet from April to August and the crop is gathered in September when the fields dry hard and afford excellent going for A.F.V.s. This coastal belt is only a narrow defile between sea and mountains from the Russian frontier at Astara to the south-west corner of the Caspian : after that it broadens out and in general varies in width from about 2 to 8 miles, excepting in the Resht area where there is the extensive delta of the Sefid Rud. On reaching Mahmudabad the hills recede considerably and continue so as far as the south-east corner of the Caspian. There are only two points where the shore is commanded from the hills, between Pahlevi and Bandar Shah ; these points are at the promontory of Sakht Sar (to the west of Ramsar) and a little to the east of Naushahr. The Caspian is practically tideless and the coastline stretches in a series of shallow indentations without a break and is devoid of natural harbours. With the exception of the Pahlevi “ murdab ” or lagoon, the lagoons are shallow marshes and the mouths of the rivers are obstructed by sandbars. The foreshore consists—at least as far as Babolsar—of a strip of (generally) firm sand varying in width. West of Pahlevi there is a wide sandy beach which extends for at least 20 kms., it is suitable for landing aircraft, and M.T. can be driven along it at 60 m.p.h. East of Pahlevi the sandy strip is less remarkable. It is probably true to say that M.T. can almost always drive along the shore but they may be stopped by the very frequent rivers and torrents which flow from the hills into the sea and usually have a certain depth at the shore. Owing to the denseness of the Caspian forests the beach route is the only natural line of communication of any consequence. This coastal strip could be rendered impassable for a defending force on land by an enemy with command of the sea, who himself enjoying unimpeded lateral communication by sea, would be able to land anywhere along the coast and strike quickly at any desired point. Landings could be made almost anywhere and boats of 2 ft. 6 ins. draught are able to come to within 100 yards or less of the beach. Access from beach to the coast road for M.T. or tanks is, as often as not, perfectly easy, except where there are high dunes. These dunes, except for a stretch of about a mile to the west of Shahsawar only prevail for the last 32 miles before reaching Babolsar. It is reported that the foreshore at Bandar Shah is mud and shifting soil and quite unsuited to landing from small boats.[Part V — continued'] (B) PORTS (C58272) G (B) PORTS ASTARA (PERSIAN) (Lat. 38° 26' N., Long. 48° 51' E. (approx.)). (a) THE PORT (1) General Astara (which rhymes with “ plasterer ”) is situated at that point on the western Caspian coast where Persia marches with Russia. It is separated from Russian Astara by the Astara Chai (or Astarinka rivulet) which is crossed by a wooden bridge which divides the two towns. It is backed by thickly afforested and almost impenetrable hills. (2) Conspicuous Objects The most conspicuous building is the 10-storey Custom House. A ruined church and the lights of Russian Astara may be seen from the sea. (5) Anchorages At f mile from the shore the depths are from 13 to 15 ft. and increase rapidly farther seaward. The bottom is sand with black and grey shell. Owing to the non-existence of a bay the anchorage is uncomfortable. With a slight breeze blowing a sea gets up which interferes with communication with the shore. During north-east and east winds vessels move away into a depth of 6 fathoms. (6) Description of Harbour There is no harbour, only a wooden jetty, reported to be high and dry. Ships lie off-shore and would discharge by barge. There are no cranes or other facilities so far as is known. (11) Warehouses and Stacking Space There is a storehouse at the Custom House. (14) Facilities for Clearing Port Area Persian Astara has no rail connection, but Russian Astara has a railway which connects with the Baku-Tiflis railway at Ajikabul. There is a difficult mountain road to Ardebil and thence to Tabriz, and a coast road, probably B.l dry weather, to Pahlevi and Resht. There is also a road of sorts from Russian Astara to Baku. (16) Estimated Daily Capacity Not more than 100 tons per day could be handled and that only in favourable weather. (b) THE TOWN (1) General Persian Astara is a squalid and decayed village with some modern houses. There is a small electric power station. BABOLSAR (Lat. 36° 43' N., Long. 52° 40' E. (approx.) ) (a) THE PORT [See Plan 14) (1) General Babolsar, formerly known as Meshed-i-Sar, is situated on the south-east shore of the Caspian between Naushah and Bandar Shah. It is very little used as a port but a certain amount of traffic has passed through it during the Russian occupation of the area. (2) Conspicuous Objects A chain of high dunes extends along the coast above which there rises a masonry tower, conspicuous from seaward. Oil tanks can also be seen. There is a red wooden beacon near the masonry tower reported to exhibit a white flashing light. (5) Anchorages Anchorage is possible at 4 cables from the shore in depths of from 15 to 18 ft. A submerged sandy ridge extends off the mouth of the river. In fresh weather vessels move away to depths of 8 or 9 fathoms 1| to 2 miles from shore where the bottom is sand and mud. 6 (6) Description of Harbour There is no real harbour, it is just an open roadstead. Discharge is by barge.62 (B) PORTS [Part V — continued] s (7) Quayage, Cranage and Clearance from Quays Jetty. There is a ramshackle wooden jetty fiear the mouth of the river Babol. Most of the jetty is now high and dry. Turcoman barges can tie up to the end of it but it is very little used. Customs W harf. This is a stone structure, the channel, however, is so shallow that only the local barges can come alongside. There is one power crane and one hand crane, each of about 10 cwt capacity.

Bandar Shah is sometimes called “ Bandar Caspian ” in order to avoid confusion with Bandar Shapur (the southern terminus of the Trans-Iranian railway) which is sometimes called “ Bandar Gulf.' Approaches The port is approached by a dredged channel about miles long and 12 to 14 ft. deep. The channel is marked by a single line of buoys. (5) Anchorages Ships have to anchor 4 or 5 miles off shore. (6) Description of Harbour The jetty, 575 ft. long and 60 ft. wide, with three standard gauge railway tracks, was built as a temporary structure about 1930. During the war the Russians strengthened and repaired it, so that it could be used by standard locomotives. It was also decked so that M.T. could drive along to the end of it. Ships discharge by means of their own derricks or by rail crane into trucks on the jetty. Ships also discharge by lighters which unload at the jetty. t (7) Quayage, Cranage and Clearance from Quays {a) The jetty at which ships berth is constructed of wood. (6) There are berths for four, or with difficulty five, ships of 800 to 1,000 tons. (c) The following cranes have been reported 1 floating .. .. .. .. Capacity, 35 tons. 1 barge .. .. .. .. Capacity, 15 tons. 1 rail .. .. .. .. .. Capacity, 8 tons. [d) There are three standard gauge railway tracks on the jetty, each with clear standing room of about 350 ft. M.T. can also be driven along the jetty. (8) Accommodation Provided dredging is maintained, four or five ships can be accommodated alongside the jetty Any number of ships can lie off the port at a distance of about 4 or 5 miles. (9) Harbour Craft One tug and numerous Turcoman barges (40 to 80 tons) are normally at the port. The dredger ' Mazanderan ’’ (for details, see under “ Pahlevi ”) has been used at the port and the Russians have used a number of smaller dredgers from their Caspian fleet. (10) Landing of Men, Stores and Vehicles by Water Transport Only the jetty can be used. The foreshore is mud and shifting soil, quite unsuitable for landing from small boats. (11) Warehouses and Stacking Space There are eight warehouses and seven open sheds, all belonging to the Customs. The covered area is about 25,000 square yards. Goods can be stacked outside the warehouses. (12) Coal, Oil and Water Coal. —No stocks are kept. Oil. —-There are no facilities for bunkering ships. Fuel Depots. —There are three oil tanks at the shore end of the jetty, each of about 50,000 gallons capacity. These are railway property, used for storing fuel oil for locomotives. The tanks are connected to the jetty by a pipe through which 200 gallons per hour can be pumped. There is also a depot beside the road to Bandar Gaz just south of the town. Water. —The railway station has a water tank of 26,500 gallons capacity, a water softening plant, pump-house and water-crane. 13 (13) Docks, Slipways and Repair Facilities No docks or slipways. There are railway repair shops. These, however, are probably little more than those usually attached to a large engine shed. (C58272) G 264 (B) PORTS [Part V — continued] (14) Facilities for Clearing Port Area Clearance is by rail. The capacity of the section of the line Bandar Shah-Tehran was, early in 1942, given as 300 tons per day ; this was considerably raised and it was reported that 1,200 to 1,500 tons per day (about six trains, each 200 tons) could be carried, provided the necessary wagons were available. The road connecting the shore with the shore end of the jetty runs on a causeway 10 ft. high. A new rail loop was constructed by the Russians near the point at which the causeway joins the jetty. Main line locomotives can now use the jetty. There are good B.l roads to Tehran, or, via Gurgan to Shahrud. (15) Normal Functions of Port Before 1941, there was a small amount of trade with the U.S.S.R. The capacity of the port was then estimated at not more than 200 tons per day. Tonnage handled in 1935-36 was :— Import .. .. .. .. 48,000 tons. Export .. .. .. .. 2,000 tons. Ships anchor off the port and load and discharge by barge. (16) Estimated Daily Capacity The daily capacity is estimated at 1,200 to 1,500 tons per day. More than four ships discharging simultaneously would cause congestion. (b) THE TOWN (1) General There is no town of any importance. There are the railway buildings, workshops and port and Customs officials’ houses. An aerodrome was under construction by the Russians at the end of 1942. The district is malarial and unhealthy. (3) Rail Facilities Bandar Shar is the Caspian terminus of the Trans-Iranian railway (standard gauge, single-track throughout). Railway tracks run from the jetty to the marshalling yard of the station. (4) Population and Labour There is normally sufficient local labour for the requirements of the port. During the war Russian labour battalions were used. (5) Government and Municipal Establishments There are only the port, customs and railway offices. (7) Light and Power There is a power plant at the railway station :— Current .. Service voltage Generators Prime mover .. A.C. 50. 220 . 2 A.E.C. and 1 Siemens. Diesel oil. (8) Water and Sanitation Sweet water is ample in winter, it is obtained from a stream which runs into the town from the hills ; in summer it is scarce. It was reported that a pipeline was to be laid from the mountains, 25 miles distant. Water is also brought daily into the port by rail. (13) Areas for Dumps and Parks Goods can be dumped on the area surrounding the warehouses. MAHMUDABAD (Lat. 36° 39' N., Long. 52° 15' E. (approx.) ). . (a) THE PORT (1) General Mahmudabad is a small town and port, situated on the south shore of the Caspian, about 24 miles west of Babolsar. the port is used for little more than the export of rice from the rice factory around which the activity of the “ port ” centres almost entirely. (2) Conspicuous Objects Two large buildings may be seen from seaward. - - . (5) Anchorages There is deep water off the shore allowing vessels to close it to one cable. The bottom is grey sand.{Part V — continued'] (B) PORTS (6) Description of Harbour There is no harbour. (7) Quayage, Cranage, and Clearance from Quays There is a wooden jetty about 900 ft. long, reported to be in bad repair. The jetty is connected with the rice factory warehouse by a double-track 60-cm. gauge decauville-railway. The depth of water at the end of the jetty is reported to have been reduced by silting to 10 ft. If the jetty were extended to a length of about 1,200 ft. two vessels of 300 to 500 tons could be berthed. Clearance is by road. (b) THE TOWN (1) General The town is small and partly modern, with a tarmac main street running east and west. (14) Facilities for Clearing Port Area A good B1 road runs to Shahi (50 miles). There is also a road south to Amol, which connects with Tehran via Abali. - * • * NAUSHAH (Lat. 36° 34' N., Long. 51° 32' E.) {See Plan 16.) Note. —Before a port was constructed here the village was called Dehnau (previously Habibabad). (a) THE PORT (1) General Naushah is situated on the southern shore of the Caspian at the northern end of the Kerej-Chalus road between Chalus and Alamdeh. It is a wholly artificial port, completed (except for dredging) in 1941. Work on it was begun in 1933 by a Dutch firm. The port of Naushah serves the recently built city of Chalus (6 miles westward). The site has apparently proved ill-chosen and its suitability as a port was insufficiently studied before work was begun. The river Chalus which debouches into the Caspian some 4 miles westward of Naushah tends to silt up this area even more.rapidly than is normal on this coast, and the small Garduk river still flows into the harbour and adds more silt, although an alternative channel which is not in use has been designed for it. During strong north winds, entry into the harbour is not possible for 2 to 3 days at a time in the months August to October. (5) Anchorages In calm weather ships anchor about 2 cables off shore. (6) Description of Harbour The harbour basin consists of the eastern and western quays which project at right angles from the southern quay. Breakwaters project from both the eastern and western quays, leaving open only a channel which has been dredged to a depth of 13 ft. (4 m.). This channel is known to have been dredged parallel with the eastern breakwater for a distance of only the first 240 yards along the eastern quay, but probably further dredging has been effected by the Russians. It has been reported that the main harbour was to be dredged to a depth of 2|^ fathoms (4’5 m.) with a 66 ft. (20 m.) strip along the south quay which will be 10 ft. (3 m.) deep. Some of this dredging may have been completed, but the hard bottom makes dredging difficult. Ships discharge direct to road vehicles and to 90-cm. gauge trucks on the light railway which runs along the eastern and southern quays. Ships also discharge into lighters. (7) Quayage, Cranage, and Clearance from Quays (a) Quays. The western quay .. .. • • - - 278 yards by 22 yards. The eastern quay - - 400 yards by 27 yards. The southern quay - - 572 yards by 22 yards. (b) Berths. —There are berths for two vessels of about 500 tons (maximum draught, 12 ft.) at the north end of the eastern quay. Recent dredging has probably increased berthing capacity of the port. (c) Berthing. —Ships are tied to bollards on the quay.

(9) Harbour Craft 1 tug 180 h.p. 1 tug .. 90 h.p. 2 floating grab dredgers (each with a small barge). 2 lighters (oil carrying). A number of Turcoman barges of 70-80 tons capacity are also said to be available. (10) Landing of Men, Stores and Vehicles by Water Transport Men, stores and vehicles could be landed direct on to the quays from ships, or by lighters. (11) Warehouses and Stacking Space 2 enclosed sheds, each of 710 square yards. 2 open godowns, each of 1,940 square yards. There are also some smaller sheds which were used for storage during the construction of the harbour. (12) Coal, Oil and Water Coal. —No stocks. Oil .—No fuelling facilities for ships are known. There is an A.I.O.C. filling station and depot at Chalus, some five miles west of Naushah. Water. —Fresh water is supplied from a plant in the town, but the plant does not communicate directly with the quays. (14) Facilities for Clearing Port Area There is a two-way tarmac road to Chalus (6 miles), from which a good B.l road continues to the railhead at Kerej (104 miles), the road Chalus-Kerej is normally closed in winter through snow until about the end of April, but could probably be kept open. There is also a good B.l all-weather road east to the railhead at Shahi (96 miles). There is a narrow-gauge railway which runs from the south quay of the port for about five miles to some stone-quarries in the hills. (15) Normal Functions of Port Normally the port has been principally used for the importation of iron for use in the blast furnace at Kerej. (16) Estimated Daily Capacity Providing sufficient labour and transport were available, capacity is estimated at 500 tons daily direct to quay and 400 tons daily from lighters. Before the Russians occupied the port the capacity was reported as being not more than 500 tons daily. (b) THE TOWN (1) General Naushah is a small modern town, built as a model town for the ex-Shah. It extends for about, one mile along the coast road and has very little depth. There are some good modern houses. (3) Rail Facilities Nil. (4) Population and Labour During the war work has been carried out by Russian labour battalions ; formerly there was sufficient labour to be had locally for the normal traffic requirements.67 [Part V — continued'] (B) PORTS (5) Government and Municipal Establishments, etc. There is a modern hospital south-east of the harbour, with a short approach down a tarmac road. There are some good offices for the port and customs officials. (7) Light and Power There is an electric power station with.3 X 100 h.p. motors and four generators south of the road and just eastward of the harbour. PAHLEVI (Lat. 37° 29' N., Long. 49° 30' E.) [See Plan No. 6.) Note .—Pahlevi was formerly called Enzeli: it is now frequently called Bandar Pahlavi. (a) THE PORT (1) General Pahlevi, formerly the principal port on the Caspian, now takes second place as a port to Bandar Shah, which is the northern terminus of the Trans-Iranian railway. It comprises the town of Pahlevi on the western sand-spit and the area of Qazian on the eastern sand-spit. These sand-spits are part of the Caspian coast line and form the entrance to a considerable “ Murdab ” or lagoon. Pahlevi and Qazian are connected by the bridges and the small intermediate island of Mianpochte, which contains a small Royal Palace and the barracks. From Qazian to Mianpochte there is a five- span modern bridge with one steel bascule and four R.C. spans and a total length of 230 yards. The bridge from Mianpochte to Pahlevi has one steel bascule and two R.C. spans and a total length of 138 yards. Both have 36-ft. roadways with tarmac surfaces. The bridge from Mianpochte to Pahlevi connects with a small square and not with the tarmac promenade road which runs round the eastern edge of the town at a lower level than this bridge. The foreshore is firm sand for at least 12| miles to the west and vehicles can travel at 60 miles per hour along it. The foreshore to the eastwards is less wide and firm, and the dunes come nearer to the sea than they do in the west. A landing ground is situated on a spit of land (Qazian Peninsula) between Murdab Bay and the Caspian. It is about one mile east of Pahlevi Town and immediately east-south-east of Qazian (suburb) on the east side of the Qazian-Resht road, 22 miles from Resht. The surface is firm and sandy but liable to flood. The firm strip of sand along the foreshore west of Pahlevi could be used for landing-grounds for a distance of about \2\ miles. It is reported that the harbour could be used as a seaplane alighting area and anchorage. Approaches The harbour is protected by two moles. The approach channel, which is about 65 ft. wide, runs south-west along the west mole for about 600 yards and then turns south-east to the Qazian side. It is reported that the channel changes its course frequently and ships are piloted in. The distance from the harbour entrance to the quay is about one mile. The .minimum depths of the approach channel in the harbour and alongside the two quays are reported to be kept at 11 ft. 5 ins. (3.50 m.) and the depth of the harbour entrance 14 ft. To prevent silting the harbour requires constant dredging. Silting has rendered the inner basin, beyond the island and creek, useless for anything except small boats. (2) Conspicuous Objects For a vessel coming from seaward by day, in clear weather, there opens a high stone tower, situated on the western shore of the strait, also petroleum tanks, and the town buildings, and as she draws nearer, the heads of the moles. On the end of each mole is an iron framework light beacon. The lights, which are fixed electric, are elevated 53 ft. above the sea and 41 ft. above the ground. From the beacon on the west mole is exhibited a white light from 123° through S. to 270° and a green light from 319° through N. to 33°. From the beacon on the east mole is exhibited a white light from 117° through S. to 270°, and a green light from 337|° through N. and E. to 117°. Both lights have low visibility. Leading beacons on the western shore of the strait in the port territory serve for the entrance into the harbour. These beacons are wooden columns, surmounted by red triangular topmarks, with their points upwards. Red fixed lights are exhibited from the beacons at night. Vessels proceed on the above leading line, on a course 215°, to a second leading line, the iron beacons of which stand on the west mole. These beacons are painted white and at night are lit by white fixed lights. The course on this line is 143° and leads to the entrance into the strait, which serves as the harbour of the port of Pahlevi. Both leading lines serve for passing clear of the flat extending westward from the east mole. (3) Tides, Tidal Streams and Currents There are no tidal variations, but other influences cause variation of the water level to the extent of about 3 ft. The current in the strait is changeable and depends on winds. In calm weather, and where there is only a gentle wind blowing, a feeble current sets out of the bay into the sea. During southerly winds (C58202) G 468 (B) PORTS [Part V — continued] this current increases in force. During northerly winds of sufficient force a reverse current sets into the bay from the sea, raising the level of the water in the bay. When the northerly winds decrease in force or cease altogether, a rapid current is formed in the direction of the sea, bringing with it much sand and mud, which block the entrance to the channel, necessitating dredging to maintain the depths, When the current is setting out of the bay the water, of a muddy yellow colour, entering the sea is easily distinguishable and forms a perceptible border, -extending sometimes for about 6 miles from the shore. This can help a vessel to fix her position when approaching the port in fog. With strong winds from seaward the in-coming swell may render a vessel’s steering difficult, and it may therefore be dangerous to attempt to enter the harbour. In such a case a vessel should lie off at anchor at 6 to 7 miles from the shore in a depth of 12 fathoms. (4) Weather Weather does not affect inshore anchorage or discharge of ships but can prevent ships from entering the harbour. In rough weather ships have to anchor in the roadstead. Goods could be transhipped to sailing vessels carrying 50 to 100 tons. (5) Anchorages q Shl P^ anchor m the harbour, except during rough weather, when they anchor in the roadstead, at 6-4 cables from the shore there are depths of from 22 ft. to 30 ft. (6-7 m. to 9 -1 m.). The bottom up to 6 fathoms (11-0 m.) is grey sand. (6) Description of Harbour Pahlevi bay or lagoon is very large but shallow, the depths generally not exceeding 7-10 ft. It is connected with the sea by straits 2| miles long. The length of the harbour is slightly more than one mile the width at the north end is 850 yards and at the south end 200 yards. The eastern mole is 850 and tne western 525 yards long. These measurements include the prolongation of the moles into seawalls. 1 e moles allow the harbour to be m constant use excepting for two or three days at a time during harbour m ° nthS When vessels cann °t enter owing to north winds and have to anchor outside the „ , •T he + i no r ma 1 1 method of discharge is by ships derricks or by manual labour. When ships are lying outside the harbour goods are transhipped by barges. ^ ° (7) Quayage, Cranage and Clearance from Quays There is roughly 900 ft. of quayage which is built of steel piles. All quays are on the Qazian side except for the small concrete landing stages on the Pahlevi side and a similar one connected with the late Shah’s Palace on Myanpushte (Mianpochte) Island where for ferVfog^TrotlhTlagoon 7 ^ ° nly b6 USed ^ landing P assen S ers from sma11 local used The moles or breakwaters are not suitable for the discharge of ships. The main quays are as follows :— (a) The Customs Quay : This quay is about 690 ft. long with a minimum width of 81 ft. (b) The Slipway Quay : The slipway quay in the naval yard is about 190 ft. long. (c) There are some wooden jetties which can only be used for small craft. also to beTuTTt^soot ^ Ru f ans w g e e xt ™ding the existing quays. New wooden jetties were also to De built. It is not known how much of this work has been completed. Three ships of about 500 tons and 10 ft. draught can be accommodated at the Customs Quay. One ship of about 500 tons and 10 ft. draught can be accommodated alongside the Slipway Quay. Ships are tied to bollards on the wharves. Cranes 1 steam floating .. .. ..

The number of harbour craft no doubt varies and probably many more have been brought by the Russians from Baku. None of the craft can be said to belong exclusively to Pahlevi as any of them may have been transferred to other Caspian ports. In September, 1942, the dredger “ Mazanderan ” was sent to Bandar Shah. (10) Landing of Men, Stores and Vehicles by Motor Transport Men, stores and vehicles can be landed at the quays. The wooden jetties can be used for landing men and goods by small craft only on account of the shallowness of the water. (11) Warehouses and Stacking Space Closed sheds .. .. .. Capacity 5,500 square metres. Open sheds .. .. .. Capacity 2,200 square metres. Other sheds have been reported as being under construction. (12) Coal Oil and Water Coal. —No coal stocks are kept. Oil. —Three oil tanks with a total capacity of 2,800 tons are situated about half a mile to the east of the naval yard. Fuel is brought by barges which are moored along wharves on the east side of the harbour whence the fuel is pumped through two pipe lines to the storage tanks. There are also :— A small tank at the fish factory for bunkering trawlers and drifters. A tank of approximately 40,000 gallons in the naval yard for bunkering craft at the wharf. Water. —There are some tanks from which water is supplied to ships. (13) Docks, Slipways and Repair Facilities Docks .—A small floating dock has been reported, dimensions as follows :— Length 150-200 ft. Width 20-30 ft. Free-board above load line .. 5 ft. Slipways .—Slipway in the naval yard built for the construction of the dredger “ Mazanderan ”, details as follows :— Capacity .. .. ... .. 500 tons. Length .. .. .. .. 199 ft. Width 14 ft. Repair Facilities .—Small repairs can be carried out. There are some workshops in the with 20 electrically-driven machines. There is also an electric welding plant and a modern 14 naval yard pile driver. (14) Facilities for Clearing Port Area The port area is cleared by lorries which proceed direct from the quays to the road. There is a good two-way road from Qazian to Resht (23 miles) from which two good B.l all-weather roads proceed :— [a) Resht-Kasvin (128 miles). From Kasvin two roads go to Tehran and Hamadan. Railhead at Kasvin. (b) Resht-Chalus-Kerej (220 miles). (Railhead) normally closed in winter until April; or Resht-Chalus-Shahi (218 miles). Railhead. There is also the Resht-Astara road (which can be reached direct from Pahlevi). Although the Russians are reported to have done much work on this road it is probably still only a B.l dry-weather road. Formerly communication was maintained with Pir-I-Bazar by flat-bottomed boats on the lagoon and from there to Resht by a narrow gauge railway. All goods are now sent from Pahlevi to Resht by lorry and the light railway has been dismantled.70 (B) PORTS [Part V — continued] (15) ^rmal Functions of Port Pahlevi has been the principal port for traffic between the U.S.S.R. and Persia and Central Europe and Persia. Petrol and oil from Baku are brought to the port by tanker and sailing vessels and supplies are unloaded direct into road transport for distribution via Kasvin. During the war (1939-1945) the port was used for 'Aid to Russia ” traffic. Tonnage handled during the year 1935-1936 was :— Imports 114,000 tons. Exports 36,000 tons. All the ships of any useful size on the Caspian are Russian. Normally Russian steamship lines maintain communications between Pahlevi and other Caspian ports. Pahlevi is a fishing centre and there is a fish factory with a refrigerating plant. Rice, wool, cotton, livestock and caviare are exported, mainly to Russia. Russian china and ironware are imported. (16) Estimated Daily Capacity Port capacity has been reported as 1,500 to 1,800 tons per day. It is estimated, however, that with the port continuously working about 1,200 tons per day is a more likely figure. (b) THE TOWN (1) General The side of Pahlevi facing the lagoon has a modern facade, with very modern looking administra tive buildings, a public garden, etc. Behind this is the small old town consisting of closely packed stone houses surrounded by small gardens with narrow winding alleys in between. Further to the west is another old village of thatched huts. Qazian has a row of shops on the way out towards Resht. There is a W/T station on the aerodrome ; telegraph, telephone. The administration normally consists of a Persian Deputy-Governor who is subordinate to the Governor General of Gilan. There is a Persian and a Russian hospital and a school and cinema. (3) Rail Facilities Nil. (4) Population and Labour The population of Pahlevi and the district surrounding to a distance of 6 kilometres was reported to be 37,511 in 1944. It consists principally of Russians (in the settlement of Qazian), Caucasians, Armenians, Turko mans and immigrants from other parts of Persia. Labour. Normally sufficient labour is available. (5) Government and Municipal Establishments, etc. The aerodrome, the electric light plants and the small repair shop at the Naval Yard. (6) Light and Power There are several small power plants for lighting but they are not interchangeable as tensions differ. There is a small power plant in the Naval Yard.. „ (7) Water and Sanitation Water supply is reported to be sufficient and good water is obtainable from wells. Sweet water can be obtained in abundance by digging to a shallow depth on the foreshore ; there are a few tanks from which water is supplied to ships. It was estimated during the Polish evacuation in April, 1942, that enough water could be found for 100,000 people if necessary. (8) Industrial Establishments The fish factory is the only establishment of importance. It is a branch of the Irano-Soviet South Caspian Fisheries operated under a concession. (9) Local Agriculture and Fishing Sheep and dairy produce are plentiful in the district. Fish are plentiful in the Caspian The principal varieties caught are sturgeon, salmon, bream and sheat-fish or silue, and pike-perch (10) Public Transport Services and Garages d R^^t arG E nUmber ° f S arages ’ and cars are numerous - Normally buses ply between Pahlevi (11) Fire Service A water tower for a fire fighting installation has been reported as being under constructionTn [Part V — continued'] 71 (B) PORTS SHAHSAWAR (Lat. 36° 48' N. : Long. 50° 52' 30' E. (approx.)) (See Plan 17.) (a) THE PORT (1) General Shahsawar is not really a port and there are no harbour or port facilities except a ramshackle jetty about 200 yards long. Ships of 600 to 800 tons periodically lie about 1,500 yards off shore and are loaded with rice from barges or small boats. Shahsawar is a trading centre of some importance and lies on the Caspian coastal road running from Resht to Chains. (2) Conspicuous Objects There is a white wooden light-beacon from which is exhibited, at an elevation of 52| ft. above sea-level and 42| ft. above the ground, a white light : Flash, 0-2 sec., eclipse, 1-8 sec., visibility is about 12 miles. It may be seen by day from a distance of about 3 miles. (5) Anchorages There are depths of 13 to 15 ft. at 2 cables from the shore, depths then increase rapidly and at 1| to 2 miles from the shore, there are depths of 20 fathoms. (b) THE TOWN (1) General There are some dozens of buildings with some two-storied wooden houses and a few modern offices. There is a main street running east and west. At the eastern exit of the town there is a large bridge over the perennial river. There is a Custom House and an Agency of the Caspian Steamship Company. 10 * * (10) Local Agriculture and Fishing Rice grows in the neighbourhood. Some provisions may be obtained. Shahsawar is the centre of the fertile region known as the Tunekabun.72 (B) PORTS [Part V—continued] LAKE URMIA General Remarks Situated in North-West Persia in the province of Azerbaijan, about 45 miles from the Turkish frontier this lake, which is the fourth largest land-locked body of water in Asia, is 88 miles long and 44 miles wide. There is a number of rocky islands dotted along the eastern shore but the bottom is said to be soft mud throughout and the beaches all round consist for the most part of gradually shelving salt mud flats. The only exception to this is at Gurmeh Khaneh, where there is an outcrop of rock near the harbour and the foreshore is littered with small rocks, which, however, do not extend more than 20 or 30 ft. into the lake. The level of the lake is subject to seasonal variations dependent on the rain and snow fall within the watershed which serves it and the subsequent evaporation of the lake during the dry season. The extreme limits are 6 ft. 0 in. to 3 ft. 0 in. on normal, but the variation in any given year rarely exceeds 3 ft. 0 in.; according to records the lake is gradually receding, the extreme high levels not having been experienced for many years now. At September, 1942, the level was 2 ft. 0 in. on normal and was not expected to alter considerably until the November-December rains when levels rise until the maximum for the year would be reached in March-April. The lake is said to be 40 ft. deep in parts and during high winds becomes choppy, particularly on the western side, but rarely rough enough to prevent the existing craft from plying—although naturally voyage times are considerably extended under adverse conditions. The high salt content of the lake (approximately 20 per cent.) has a corrosive action on the steel craft (noticeably on the rivets) which results in rapid wear and high maintenance. When the temperature falls below zero, as it frequently does between mid-December and mid-February, there is a tendency for the salt to cake on the hulls and propellers of the vessels and therefore retard progress to such an extent that it is sometimes necessary to stop and chip off the salt. No moorings are available anywhere in the lake and craft ride at anchor off shore. Ports There are five small ports situated around the lake-, but of these only three are of any consequence. They are Haiderabad, which serves Oushni-Maghadi (Sulduz Area), Sharif Khaneh, the terminus of the railway from Tabriz, and Gurmeh Khaneh (or Golman Khaneh) which is the port for the town of Urmia (Rezaieh). The other two, Khantakhti and Danalu serve occasionally as ports of shipment for local produce. Port facilities are practically non-existent. Merchandise is loaded on to the steamers and barges by dock labourers carrying the goods on their backs. All roads leading to these ports are reported to be good, they include the following :— Urmia-Shahpoor-Khoi-Marend-Tabriz, reported to be suitable for motor traffic. Urmia—Maghadeh, reported to be in good condition. The road divides into two sections, one section going to Oushni and the other to Khaneh on the Iraq frontier. Mahabad—Sakiz—Hamadan—Kermanshah, reported to be in good condition. Another road, reported to have been recently completed is that from Urmia to the Turkish frontier, passing through the small Kurd village, Gougazi. GURMEH KHANEH (or GORMAN KHANEH) (a) THE PORT (1) General Situated mid-way on the western side of the lake, 36 miles by water from Haiderabad, the water has not apparently receded as there are no mud flats. There is a bi-weekly night service to Sharif Khaneh. Coolie labour is available from the town of Rezaieh, 12 miles distant and from the surrounding villages. (7) Quayage, Cranage and Clearance from Quays There is a jetty 564 ft. in length, with a depth of water at the end of 9 ft. in the dry season. The foreshore shelves here far more rapidly than at Haiderabad and the jetty is therefore comparatively short. J A DecauviUe railway (2 ft 6 in.) runs the whole length of the jetty which is also used by 3-ton lorries. A few lorries are available. Russian Army M.T. were used during the war. the lake 16 ^ ^ adeqUate supply of fresh water which is Piped alon g the jetty for use by the vessels on The road to Rezaieh is reported to be quite good. (9) Harbour Craft See Sharif Khaneh. (16) Estimated Daily Capacity It is estimated that the port could, if necessary, to discharging normal south-bound traffic. Labour is where large numbers of coolies are available. discharge 500 tons per 24-hour day in addition obtained fi om Rezaieh and surrounding villages,[Part V — continued] (B) PORTS HAIDERABAD (a) THE PORT (I) General Haiderabad is situated on the extreme south-western shore of Lake Urmia at the junction of the roads to Rezaieh to the north, Rowanduz and Kirkuk to the west and Mehabad and Minduab to the south-east. There is an adequate supply of fresh water. (7) Quayage, Cranage and Clearance from Quays There is a jetty 640 ft. in length, alongside which shallow draught barges can load #hd discharge at almost any point. A Decauville railway runs to the end of the jetty from the storage shed. (9) Harbour Craft See Sharif Khaneh. (II) Warehousing and Stacking Space Covered accommodation consists of one storage shed. There is plenty of open storage space. (16) Estimated Daily Capacity About 500 tons per day. SHARIF KHANEH (a) THE PORT (1) General Situated at the north-eastern corner of Lake Urmia, 42 miles by water from Gurmeh Khaneh and 78 miles from Haiderabad, Sharif Khaneh has some importance as being the only port on the lake which is rail served, being the terminus of the branch railway line (5 ft. 0 in. gauge) which leaves the main Julfa-Tabriz line to Sufian (38 miles). (7) Quayage, Cranage and Clearance from Quays (a) The foreshore shelves very gradually and the jetty is about 1,300 yds. long and 15 ft. wide. The part of the jetty which crosses the mud flats forms a causeway reinforced with stones along which the railway runs. Where the level of the lake is low tugs stand off about 30 yards from the end of the jetty and the craft are warped by means of a hand capstan on the pier. Passenger and cargo boats can usually go alongside the jetty. Craft can generally be loaded or discharged at the second berth on the jetty, thus reducing the carry by about half. (b) There is a mobile crane of unknown capacity at the end of the jetty. (c) There is a 12 ft. 6 in. Decauville railway which runs from the pier head. (d) There is a small electric power plant for lighting the port. (9) Harbour Crafl Harbour craft as last reported consist of 6 tugs or steam boats and 10 barges in usable condition. Details of the craft are as follows :— H.P. Capacity. Tugs. Tons “ Pahlevi ” 2 x 110 120 “ Shahpur” 110 90 “ Akheker ” 80 40 “ Iran ” 80 40 “ Ahi ” 80 40 “ Rezaieh ' 20 20 350 Barges “ Khorshud ” — 200/250 ' Sharif Khaneh ” — 120/130 “ Golman Khaneh ” — 120/130 No.'ll — 100/120 “ Maragheh ” — 50/90 “ Madayin ” — 50/90 “ Mahabad ” — 50/90 “ Azar ” . . — 50 “ Tabriz ” (wooden) — 200/250 “ Shahu ” (wooden) — 160/175 Total Tonnage — 1,050/1,375 The only vessel capable of towing two barges is the Pahlevi. The tugs themselves also have a carrying capacity which can be utilised without affecting the turn round of the vessels.74 (B) PORTS [Part V — continued] The times taken on the voyage between Sharif Khaneh and Haiderabad are as follows :— Alone. 1 Barge. Hours Hours “ Pahlevi ” 9 11 ' Shahpur ” 10 12 “ Akhker ” 10 12 “ Iran ” 10 12 “ Ahi ' 10 12 “ Rezaieh ” ' 12 15 It has been reported that the engines of the tugs required overhauling and spare parts. It is possible that the railway workshop at Tabriz has been utilised by the Russian Military Authorities to effect the necessary repairs. There are no sailing vessels. (11) Warehouses and Stacking Space Warehousing is limited to two small sheds on the jetty and some storage space at the railway station. There is, however, in fine weather, ample space for dumping. (13) Docks, Slipways and Repair Facilities There are no docks or slipways. There is a branch of the main workshops of the Urmia Lake Navigation Company which are at Tabriz, under Russian control (1945). (14) Facilities for Clearing Port Area X xu There is a branc ? 1 of the Tabriz-Julfa railway. The line passes through the station to the end oi the Tf usewa y running to the lake side where it divides into two dead ends each capable of taking X 20-ton waggons. The railway station is about 150 yards from the landward end of the jetty. The journey from Sharif Khaneh to Tabriz by train takes 15£ hours. Th6re is a dry weather road to Sufian. (16) Estimated Daily Capacity Provided that sufficient railway waggons and an adequate supply should be able to deal with about 500 tons per day. of labour are available the port (b) THE TOWN • (1) General , T^ e Vllla g e consists of about 200 houses spread over an area of about half a mile. The hills above the village are cut up by a large number of torrent beds running in a north-east, south-west direction. (8) Water and Sanitation Water is supplied by springs. (10) Local Agriculture and Fishing The surrounding district produces cotton, almonds, vegetables and cereals. The high salt content of the lake, approximately 20 per cent., precludes the existence of fish.75 [Part V — continued] (C) BASE FACILITIES (C) BASE FACILITIES AND MAINTENANCE OF THE FLEET : SUMMARY (1) Naval Dockyards and Bases (a) Persian Gulf Khorramshahr. On the southern seaboard of Persia the only port with any facilities for fleet maintenance is Khorramshahr. Before its occupation by the Allied Forces it was the base for the Persian naval forces of the south, its workshops and repair facilities being adequate for the small vessels of the Persian Navy. Up to 1936 the Persian sloops refitted at the R.I.N. Dockyard, Bombay, and the patrol boats were docked in the A.I.O.C. floating dock at Abadan. In 1936 a floating dock, with a lifting capacity of approximately 6,000 tons, was brought to the gulf with the intention of mooring it at Khorramshahr, but this proved impracticable and it was berthed in the Khor Maramus at Bandar Shahpur. This dock was transferred to Massawa in 1942. There have been reports that the Persian Government intended to establish small naval bases along the gulf littoral; Hen jam and Kharg Island being mentioned as possible bases, but the war prevented these projects from materialising. Facilities are as follows :—• Docks and Slipways .. Nil, with the exception of a partially completed slip intended for 110-ft. M.L.s. Repair Facilities .. There is a workshop which undertook minor repairs during the occupation. Since the R.N. vacated the base in 1945 repairs have been carried out by the A.I.O.C. of Abadan. (b) Caspian Pahlevi. —Before the war such Persian forces as were maintained in the Caspian were based on this port. Facilities are as follows :— Lifting Capacity. Length. Width. Floating Dock .... ? 150-200 ft. 20-30 ft. Slipway .. .. 500 tons. 199 ft. 14 ft. Repair Facilities .. Small repairs and electric welding can be undertaken.

Two slipways capable of taking 110-ft. M.L.s. Repairs to small vessels can be carried out. There are electrical workshops, and battery charging can be undertaken. Bandar Shapur Slipway Repair Facilities There is a slipway capable of handling small craft and barges only. kl. Bushire Docks and Slipways Repair Facilities Bandar Shah Docks and Slipways Repair Facilities Nil. Quite small, repair and welding facilities only. Nil. Railway workshops only. (3) Oil Storage and Coal Depots Abadan Oil .. .. .. Unlimited stocks are available, with facilities for supplying ships by pipe line at the jetties. Coal .. .. .. A small stock of coal is kept for the use of the A.I.O.C. Bandar Shapur Oil Coal Fuel can be supplied by rail tank car to ships alongside the jetty. There are oil berths at Bandar Mashur (7 miles). No stocks are kept. (4) Arsenals and War Material Factories In the Tehran district there are the following :—• (i) The City Arsenal This plant is said to be designed to produce 300 light shells and 150,000 rounds S.A.A. daily. There is a cartridge-making machine imported from Germany. There is a section for the manufacture of rifles and machine guns. (ii) Explosive and chemical works at Parchin (20 miles south-east of Tehran, on the right bank of the Jahrud River). This factory is capable of producing cordite, dynamite, guncotton and powder, as well as acids and other chemicals, and employs about 350 workers.
