These are covered in a patterned fabric featuring roses, pomegranates and other botanical motifs. See also 1781.b.6/23The man wears a dark-coloured outer robe, star-patterned jalabiya underneath it and a white turban with a dark-coloured cap. On both hands he wears rings and ornately-buckled shoes.The negative has had hand-work applied, causing it to take on a soft-shaded quality in places. In particular, the background appears to have been substituted, aside from the carpet on which the man is seated.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Portrait photography</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023619120.0x00004b#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
