Administrative Boundaries. 1 . Fars is one of the largest of the provinces of Persia; to the south it is bounded by the Persian Gulf, to the west its boundary marches with that of Arabistan. Starting 8 miles north-west of Bandar Dilam and some 4 miles north-west of Bandar Hammal the frontier follows the course of the Shur stream, which runs a few miles east of and parallel to the Hindlan river, from the sea, till it crosses the Hindlan near Deh Mulla. Going north the frontier then crosses the Ramuz-Behbehan road between Jaizan and Kuraisheh and follows the Kuhgalu-Bakh- tiari tribal boundary till the Qashqal country is reached. The whole of the Kuhgalu country is in theory part of Fars and subject to the Governor of Behbehan. Latterly, however, it has be^administered by the Bakhtiari Khans. This part of the boundary is described in detail in Volumes II and IV of this report and need not be further mentioned here. C361GSB b2 /Tj 2 . The boundary between the Bakhtlari territory and th&gt;Qash- oai country (or Isfahan province—it is not always clear which) is followed, BasakI being well within the former, but the line does no attain precision anywhere. The boundary between 1 ais and the province of Isfahan is scarcely less vague; it is stated, according to one version, to cross the Shiraz-Isfahiin road just north of Yazd-i-khas , according to another 7 miles north of that village along the ridge of the Gard-i-Gir hills; according to the Fdrsndmeh half way between Amm- abad and Maqsud Begi. Finally, the writer was informed in 1911, on the spot, that Aminabad was transferred to Isfahan province when purchased by the late ’Atabeg-i-A’zam, then Amm-us-Sult^, .irhljri' jgp i the more northerly village of IM aqsud Begi_ 3 T aaJd an^ei i e ^ on its purchase by the late Karman Faring Partly no doubt as a result of the uncertainty that prevails regarding the positionot the boundary, the Yazd-i-Khast-Aminabad and Jaizan-Kuiaishet sections respectively of the Shiraz-Isfahan, and Behbehan-Ahwaz roads have for many years been notoriously unsafe. The eastern boundary marches successively with that of Isfahan, and with that of theAbrkuh, Shahr-i-Babak, andSirjan districts ol the province of Yazd, the frontier districts of Fars along this hue being Abadeh-i-Iqlid, Bawanat, and Sab’eh ; it finally coincides with that of Laristan, being bounded to the east by the district of Band ar ’Abbas till it reaches the sea near the mouth of the • liur river m the Clarence Straits. Barktan, though pcni-uf F5mt in axdiliecHrom consideration .. in this Report, owing partly to the fact that omHnTOrmr^ri ing the district is very meagre, and partly to the fact that it is sparse- lv inhabited by a population of no political importance. Its bonne - aries are very vague, and seem to have been altered considerably in recent years, the general effect of successive changes being to reduce the size of the district. 4 . To the west, Laristan is bounded by the districts of Gabandi, Galehdar, ’Alamarvdasht, and Khun {q.v .): on the _coast the boundary line would seem to start between Bandar Shiyu and Ban dar Bustaneh, and to run north-north-east crossing the Waravi-Lar road some 15 miles east of the former village. On the ’Alamarvdasht-Bairam road local information places the boundary between Rogi Husaim and Mulai, the latter falling withim&gt; Laiistan ; on the Haftavan-Lar road it is said to lie between Ashnai and Mazz; it then follows the limit of the Khunj buluk, in which are included the villages of Biikhard and Pashneh, till the Bidshahr and Jiyum districts of Fars proper are reached. Bidshahr includesHarian and Karlan, but not Binaru, which is apparently within Lai istan. To the north Laristan is bounded by the districts of Darab and Sab’eh, the limits of which districts lack any sort of precision. 5 . The jurisdiction of the Governor-General of Fars is not exer cised, however, even in theory, over the whole of this area. The Governor of the Gulf ports, with headquarters at Bushire, is respon sible for that town, and for the Shlbkuh Ports and immediate hinter land. The DashtI district is generally farmed and controlled by the Governor of the Gulf Ports. Dashtistan is likewise riot entirely under Shiraz, certain of th#-smithcm districts, including the group of 'vilkigfis—-for which the Shaikh of Chahkutah is responsible, -being under Bushire. This question is further examined under “Administrative Divi- sions.” Administrative Divisions. 6 . Pars is divided for administrative purposes into a number of Governments, Deputy Governments and districts (huluks) : these divisions are mostly ancient and are well known to all. Next come towns and districts under the rule of Deputy Gover nors : such are Abadeh-i-Iqlld, Darab, Firuzabad, Jahrum, Kazarun, Qunquri (and Bawanat) and Shiraz (under a Beglerbegi). Lastly come districts (or buluJcs) commonly recognized as ad ministrative units, but as a rule unprovided with any definitely responsible local authorities : a list of these with the estimated po pulation of each is given in Appendix I. A few of these on the coast, such as DashtI, Haiat Daud, Angali, Chahkutah and Gabandi, have powerful local Khans, who can control the whole district in which they reside, but such men will seldom be found inland, as the exis tence of powerful nomad tribes makes local autonomy impossible. 7. The position of the Governor of the Gulf Ports .—The sphere of this official varies considerably • according to the momentary exigencies of the political situation : his authority nominally extends along the whole of the coast of Fars, from Dilam to the Perso- Baluch frontier, as well as to such islands as belong to Persia. On the Shibkuh Coast alone is his authority in any way indeterminate, owing to the recent assumption by the Customs of responsibility for securing payment by the local Shaikhs and Khans of mdliydt on a reduced scale, which duty carries with it the obligation to ensure some degree of order along the coast.4 The following maritime districts are under his control Angali, Dashti. Buahire. Chahkutah. HiaiSt Daud, Lingeh. The ’Asalu and Naband districts of Shibkuh. KhamTr. Rudhllleh. Zha. The above represent the narrowest limits of his sphere; should he farm the revenue of contiguous districts such as Dashtistan (includ ing Burazjan) and Tangistan, his sphere of practical jurisdiction is enlarged. This was the policy of the Daria BegT, for many years Governor of the Gulf Ports, and was hippm! ^ vnth favour both by the British Residency at Bushire, and the Persian Customs Adminis tration, who have more influence with the Governor of the Gulf Ports than with his colleague at Shiraz. 8 . Properties owned by Rizd Quit Klein Nhdm-us-Saltaneh.—The Nizam-us-Saltaneh has acquired, partly by inheritance, and partly - by purchase, very extensive properties through South-West Persia. All bis properties in Pars were mortgaged by him in 1912 to the Shaikh of Muhamma^h., t The following is a list of such pro perties as far as is known :— Das/todrc—Several villages north of Burazjan are held by him as tiul (fiefs). ^ Ddliki 3 dang* Rizeh 3 dang. Nabardeh (1) 3 dang. Zird .—The whole district. Mazdral —The Nizam manages the affairs of the district which he holds, whether in farm or as tiul is not clear, through an agent. The amount he realizes annually is about 25,000 tumans in addition to which he takes half the date crop and sixty krans for every kharwdr of grain sold. . J 9. Physical Geography.—Vais may be divided climatically and to some extent physically, into three ^visions : KIushL *3 dung=l of property : land is divided into 6 dang for purposes of computation5 from Bushire, to only one or two miles or even less behind Daiyir Kangan and Tahlrl. 10 . Sardsir .—-The following districts are reckoned sardsir or sarhadd by natives : they cover, roughly speaking, that part of the province north of a line drawn through Mian Kutal, Fhuzabad, Jahrum, and Darab, thus including the greater part of the province. Abadeh-i Iqlld. Kkafrak. Abadtth Tashk, Kuhmarroh. Abraj. Kurbal. Aruakan. Marvdaskt. Baiza. Mashhad Murghab. Bawanat. Nlrlz. Chehar Dangeh, Qunqurl, Dizkurd. Ramjird. Istohbanat. Sarchahan. Kam Firuz Sarvistan. Kamla. Shiraz. Kavar. Shulistan. Khafr. Saikh. . Brom the sea as far as Shiraz, the mount* valleys of from four to ten miles in breadth. They are in general very fertile, and afford abundant grazing ; even in the garmslr, water is always obtainable at no great depth, but lack of popu lation, and the anarchy, that with rare intervals has long prevailed in the province, combine to retard its agricultural development. hrom Shiraz northwards the mountain system is less regular and the valleys generally more undulating, though very fertile ; the limit of cultivation is about 8 , 000 / . The hills are as a rule bar ren ; oak forests, which abound in Luristan, are reproduced in Fars only along a narrow belt scarcely 15 miles broad near Mian Kutal, extending far to the north-west, but not more than 50 miles to the east. North of Shiraz there is little forest, except near the Tang-i- Bulaghimountains are seldom over 4,000'from top to base, except in the Kuhgalu country ; from the sea northwards they rise tier upon tier, increasing gradually in elevation, the folds being generally qua- quayersal, and fairly regular, and the increase in height of the inter vening valleys proportionate to that of the hills.6 12. The GVwrmr.—This term, in native parlance, signifies aH4is- tricts lying between the sardsir (v. s.) and the sea, though for our pu^ poses it is convenient to consider separately the coastal district which forms a part of it. It consists of valleys, seldom more than 5 miles wide, running roughly parallel to each other in a north-west and south-east direction, separated by barren mountain ranges, some 3,000'in height. It is sparsely populated, villages in some of the ‘ Bulukdt lying at a great distance one from another; numerous ruins demonstrate the existence in former times of a much larger sedentary population; the plains and valleys are sparsely wooded, the only common tree being the Jcumr or jujube, but on the higher hills there is a very large quantity of wood, small trees as a rule, wild almonds, hanak and kulkhung predominating. Grazing is usually excellent but dry after May ; nomad tribes frequent this tract from Novem ber to April, spending the rest of the year in the sarhadd. The date palm flourishes everywhere even in the more northerly districts of Firuzabad, Fasa and Jahrum ; the fruit is but little ex ported, but forms an important addition to the indigenous food supply. Kazarun represents about the most northerly point of cultivation of the date palm along the main caravan routes. 13. The Coastal strip .—The following districts, taken from west to east, are comprised in the flat alluvial tract lying between the sea and the most southerly mountain ranges of Fars. Estimated population. Name. Remarks. Liraw! .. 14,500 12,000 4,000 2,500 10,000 4.000 3.000 12,000 10,000 20,000 8.000 Haiat Daud and Rig Rudhjlleh Angali .. Shabankareh Zira Mazarai Burazjan Tangistan DashtI .. Shibkuh Total 100,000 The Bastak district is excluded from consideration, as it is part anstan. as also Linwb nnrl R'barvrT„ i. • \ ^ paicpartly alluvial, and partly sandy, studded with date palm planta- tion«r/ and very sparsely wooded with kundr bush. It supports, as will be seen from the above list, a relatively large population, which has, despite a sedentary life, not yet learned to forego the luxury of blood feuds, and internecine war on a small scale. It is nevertheless better ordered and governed than the rest of the prov ince. 14. Rivers .—The greater part of the drainage system of Ears flows into the Persian Gulf. The rivers from west to east are as follows :— (T) The Khur Khalil entering the sea near Ganaweh. ( 2 ) The_Sijr^e«tering the sea 10 miles south of Bandar Rig. Rudhilleh (formed by the junction of the Daliki and the Snahpur streams) entering the sea 20 miles north-west of Bushire. (4) The Chahkutah entering the sea 10 miles east of Bushire. (5) The Mund entering the sea at Khur Ziarat. 15.(i) The Khur Khalil forms the harbour for the sailing craft and sea traffic of the villages of Ganaweh. A Customs post and a growing village is situated on its northern bank at the mouth. About one mile from its mouth the creek begins to wind through a deep cutting, and the bed of the stream winds across the plain behind the Kuh-i-Barg, and south of the village of Shul at the foot of the coast range. It is a salt stream, and is practically dry a few miles beyond its mouth for the greater part of the year, except during the rainy season. (ii) The Sur (generally called Sur-i-Bldu) is a salt stream flow ing into the sea a few miles south-east of Bandar Rig. It forms the boundary between Rudhilleh and Haiat Baud until east of Bldu, and between Haiat Baud and Shabankareh till it reaches the hills (Manur). When crossed near Bidu it has a broad bed, some 20 yards across, and shelving sandy banks, but is at most seasons easily fordable. At Chehar Rustai, near its descent from the hills, it flows through a deep gorge, and, though shallow, is broad, and (in May) there is a considerable volume of water. After the rains in January the S'hr overflows its banks, and together with the. Rudhilleh puts the country between the two streams under water for many miles, and makes travel well-nigh impossible. {Hi) (a) The Rudhilleh river is an estuary composed of the Shah- pur and Baliki rivers, which unite at Burudagah, about 30 miles above its mouth. It is navigable by small sailing craft (at rtain seasons) as far as Cham-i-Tangi, about 18 miles ud. At8 Malimadi it is a wide stream, 30-^0 yards broad, running between high banks perhaps 30 feet high, and is usually crossed in a ferry. In the rainy season the accumulation of water from the mountains sweeps down, and overflows the banks on both sides, often doing great damage to buildings. For more than 20 miles in length, on either side of the river the land is for miles under water. (b) The Shdhpur river, alternatively known as the Rudkhaneh-i- Shlrin, rises in the Rinjun hills behind the Tang-i-Chakan. After winding through this pass it debouches on to the Shahpur plain. At Kaleh Hakim Bashi it flows through a broad gully, having on its northern bank high cliffs, while the southern shore shelves. It is here some 30 yards across and has a swift-cuwefttr—After leaving the Shahpur plain not far from Bushakfm, it flows past the base of the Kuh-i-Surkh and thence to Riidak. From Rudak it passes north of the Kutal-i-Kumarij till it reaches the village of Charum, where it is about 25 yards across, and has an open bank on the one side. It then flows through the Khisht plain on its northern side past the village of AikunI, where it is some 40 yards across, some 3 feet deep before the heavy rains, and is used for irrigation. Thence it passes down to the coast plain through the district of Mazarai and becomes the border of the Shabankareh and Zira districts. At Saklabad, the chief town of Zira, it is about 80 yards wide, its waters are much sweeter than those of the Dalikt stream. (c) The Ddlikl river, alternatively called the Rudkhaneh-i- Shur, traverses the Jirreh valley, and p assing through the moun tains oFTamilah, emerges alfew nnIes~aW^e--feWJdaliki bridge ; its waters, which appear very deep, are known as the DanaTQuii. Below the Daliki bridge they are very swift and deep in places. The river does not debouch on to the plain by the caravan track, but turns off to the right. It then becomes the boundary between Daliki and Burazjan on its left bank and Zira on its right. In its course through Burazjan in the neighbourhood of Ziarat it has cut innumerable gullies all over the plain and a wide detour has to be made. There is a ford at Barregah where the river appears about 150 yards wide. The water of this river is very salt. (iv) The CJmhkutdh stream may be traced back to the small river which waters the productive Khaviz (Khaiz) valley. It is deep in places, but never very broad on its passage down towards Ahram. In the plain between Ahram and Chah-i-Pir there is prac tically no water in the autumn and its chief importance would seem to be the way in which it has cut up the plain for several miles and ren dered it boggy, treacherous and impassable. At AhmadI the river bed is about 15 yards across, and has little water, except after the winter rains, when it is frequently unfordable for days.9 a (v) The course of the Mund River, known in its upper reaches successively as the Waz and Kara Aghach, w r as for long unmapped, but surveys by Lieutenant Crookshank, R.E., in 1900-2 and by Lieutenant Wilson in 1911, covering practically the whole of its course, now enable it to be described with accuracy. The exist ence of up-to-date degree sheets of this part of the country renders any detailed narrative of its course superfluous. It is sufficient to say that it rises in the mountains north of Khan-i-Zinian at a place called Bun Rud, it then flow T s south-south-east past Aiur to Kavar, its waters being utilized for irrigation at many points from Khan-i- Zinian to Pas-i-Rudak in the Dizgah plain. It enters the Kavar plain by a defile, in which an ancient stone dam built for irrigation purposes exists, thence it flow's down the Kavar-KhaTr valley to Taduan, where it cuts through the end of the Kuh-i-Safid by a remarkable gorge and, after a circuitous course amongst the mountains of the Simakan district, emerges to the desolate Manyun valley (20 miles west of Jahrum) wfliere it is joined by the Fasa stream (practically dry in summer), by the Maimand stream, and, a little further down, by a freshwater river rising west of the deserted hill fort of Qalat-i-Zangibar, and flowing past the willed village of Madkhun in a narrow gorge. It obtains access to the Qir-o-Karzin plain, which it waters very completely, by a very narrow and precipitous gorge through the mountains, part of which is quite impass Lie even on foot. For some w r ay after this it can be followed on horse or foot, through the plains of Afzar and Laghar-o-Maku, through the Tang-i-Shahriyari to Kupkab, near Gird Bisheh, where the valley is about 3 miles broad. Its course now becomes impassable for some miles until it emerges on to the Dizgah plain, w'here it is joined by— ( 1 ) the Kurdeh stream, dry for eight months in the year, rising a few miles west of Haftavan, in Latitude 27°45', Longitude 53°15'; ( 2 ) the ’Alamarvdasht and Fidah stream, one branch rising a few miles south of Lar, another branch, shown in Lieu tenant Crookshank’s maps as running through the Taj g- i-Khur, appearing to drain the neighbourhood of Khunj, Bukhard and Binaru, though this is doubtful, local report stating that the surplus waters of these places accumulate in a maish, dry in summer, south-w'est of Khunj ; (3) the Shur river, a salt stream, rising in the Khwajai dis trict, north of Firuzabad ; this tributary greatly exceeds the main stream in volume and is for the greater part of the year quite unfordable : below the junction the waters of the Mund, by which name the stream then c;6iasB c10 becomes known, are too salt to be of use for irriga tion ; ( 4 ) the Jam and Riz stream, fresh, but dry for 8 months in the year. It will be seen from the above survey of the river and its tribu taries that it drains a very wide area ; the comparatively small volume of its waters is due to the fact that its basin embraces no lofty ranges, except perhaps the Kuh-i-Safid. It is also eloquent of the small rainfall of Laristan that the Alamarvdasht tributary, though 200 miles long, and with a basin as large as that of many an English river, is quite dry for 8 months in the year. 16 The Kara Aghach river is or was bridged at the following points :— ( 1 ) Khan-i-Zinian. ( 2 ) Kavar (bridge in ruins). ( 3 ) Qir-o-Karzm plain. The Pul-i-Arus, a two-storied bridge, the roadway being in the upper storey : this was seen by Abbott in 1873, but not by Wilson in 1911. (4) Near Baghan. Remains of an ancient bridge. The river is useless for navigation, it is fordable except in flood time even at its mouth, where the depth at low water does not usually exceed 3^'. It can be ascended by native craft of 40 tons burden almost as far as Kaki. Khur Ziarat, which forms its mouth, is a small creek with low banks which can be en tered at high water, but the entrance is exposed and does not form a good harbour for native craft. For a short distance to the north of it, and for some miles southward, the coast of the mainland is swampy. This river was known to the ancients as the Sitakus or Siti- onagus, the earliest mention of it is made by Arrian (in his “ Indica,” chapter 38), who quotes from Alexander’s Admiral, Nearchos, who made the voyage from the Indus to the Euphrates. Next comes Ptolemy ( 2 nd century A.D.) whose knowledge of the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf was evidently based on log-books from the time of the Ptolemean dynasty in Egypt and the first Roman Emperors. The Arabian Geographers knew the river well, and described it with great accuracy, as is exemplified by Istakhri’s “ Kitab-ul-Ma- mdlik wal-Masdlih” 17. We now come to the rivers of Fars which do not reach the sea ; there is only one such of importance, the Kur or Bandamlr ot which the Pulvar is a tributary,11 The Pulvar rises in the Chehar Bangeh district, in Latitude 31, with a branch rising in the hills north of L)ehbld. The main stream flows through a lake or marsh in Latitude 30°30', Longitude 52°o0' and is crossed by the Shlraz-Isfahan road under Khaneh Khurgan. It flows through the Mashhad-i-Murghab plain past Pasargadae and the tomb of Cyrus, and through the Tang-i-Bulaghi to Sivand and Khafrak, finally effecting a junction with the parent stream in Marv- dasht. The main stream known as Kur rises in the Ujan valley and runs north-west to Dizkurd, then turning south and south-easi runs through Kam Eiruz and Ramjird to Marvdasht, where it forms ex tensive marshes in spring time; then passing through the Kurba it falls into Lake Niriz. The river is extensively used for irriga tion and many dams obstruct its course. Thirty miles above Pul-i-Khan it is dammed by the Band-i- Nasirl, so called from the fact that Nasir-ud-Din Shah in 1890 repaired the structure, which was originally erected by the Achsemenian kings. Eight miles below Pul-i-Khan is the dam of As’ad-ud-Dauleh {circa 970 A.D.) upon which stands a bridge of 13 arches, 120 yards in length. Other weirs are Kushkak, Qarasun, Husainabad, Band-i-Tilaku (21 miles south-south-east of Khur) and Pira Mas. 18. In conclusion it may be mentioned that although the Hindian river reaches the sea through Arabistan, the two main streams of which it is composed lie entirely in Ears. The southern branch rises,near Rudian north-west of Shiraz, and joins the Khairabad river near Zaidan. Near the junction the southern branch has broken into several channels, each of which has to be crossed. In the spring, owing to the current, laden animals have to be led and guided by local swim mers and the water reaches to the knees of a horseman. The main channel, 50 yards wide, is extensively used for irri gating the surrounding fertile plain. 19. ImIccs. —Ears contains several of the salt lakes which are a peculiar characteristic of Persia. They are briefly described below :— ( 1 ) The Fdmur Lake, or Daria-i-Paiishan : in the Kazarun district, 13 miles south-east of the town of that name : a long narrow sheet of water stretching north-west and south-east about 3| miles long by § to 1 mile broad. c 212 On its south side it is very shallow but doubtless deepens towards the centre : lofty limestone hills lie to north and south of it: it is fed hy a stream coming in from the south-east close to the village of Famur, its marshy banks afford excellent grazing, and good shooting and fishing. ( 2 ) The Dashtarjdn Lake, in the plain of the same name, dries up almost entirely in summer : extensive marshes lie on its banks. (3) Mahdrlu the smallest of the three main salt lakes of Fars : situated in the Shiraz plain surrounded by low hills : fed by the Shiraz stream and by the drainage of Sar- vistan. Extensive marshes lie at its northern end, very shallow for more than a mile from the shore; nu merous fresh water springs exist along its shores. Avocets and other water-fowl abound. (4) Nargis or Tashk the second largest of the salt lakes of Fars, lying to the north of lake Niriz, with which it is connected by two channels and which it resembles generally. (5) Niriz, or Njriz Bakhtigdn—T\\z largest of the salt lakes of Fars, lying 5 miles west of Shiraz. Length 60 miles, breadth 3 to 5 miles : it receives the waters of the Kur or Bandamir. In a dry summer season the water eva porates entirely and the bed may then be crossed on foot, the salt which remains is extensively collected ; it is of fine quality and much in demand throughout Fars. Water-fowl such as swans, flamingoes, ducks and avocets abound. The shores have no sandy beach, but consist of soft, fine, evil-smelling mud : no shells to be seen. It contains no fish, but polypi or molluscs presumably abound, seeing how frequented the lake is bv waders'; there is a fresh spring at Khur. Several wooded islets break the monotony of the surface of the lake. The northern shores are inhabited by Lashani tribes {g v) The long inlet by the villages of Tashk and Kushk is totally dry by June, but cannot be crossed till later in the year. 20 . Pogmhtion.—'So census of Fars has ever been taken and there are no figures of any kind from which it is possible to deduce a reliable estimate of the population : the figures given herein are } ase d J 11 ^me cases upon detailed tables of the number of houses in each village, and m others are estimates based on the relative13 area and populousness of each district. In making such esti mates five souls have been reckoned per house, a figure which has been found in practice to be fairly reliable when applied to villages. Nomad tribes have likewise been reckoned at five per tent and where different estimates of the number of tents have been given the highest figures supplied have been taken. 21. The total of the nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes (vide chapter III) works out as follows :— Qashqal Tents. 45,000 Khamseh .. 22,800 Boir AhmadI 4,500 MamassanI 3,000 Chehar Rah! 600 Lashanl 300 Minor Kuhgalu tribes in Fars, say 800 Total .. 77,000 tents or 385,000 souls. The sedentary population, deduced from the detailed figures given in the appendix, works out at 550,000 for the whole of Fars including Laristan. Some important deduction may legitimately be made from these figures, as size of population is the chief factor in the pro duction of revenue, and exports, and in the consumption of imports. 22 . The area of Fars, including Laristan and the Kuhgalu country being about 100,000 square miles, the density of popula tion works out at about 9 per square mile for the whole area. The most densely populated districts are :— ( 1 ) The coastal strip from Dilam to the mouth of the Mund river, commercially and to a large extent, administra tively dependent on Bushire, with a population of over 100 , 000 . ( 2 ) The country north, north-east, east, and south-east of Shiraz within a radius of 60 miles of that city, with an14 estimated population, including that of the capital, of 140,000 made up as follows : Name of district. Population. Remarks. Shiraz district Shiraz town Abraj . • Ardakan Arsinjan Baiza Kam Firuz Kamin .. Kavar .. 30,000 40,000 1,000 5,000 12,500 9.000 3.500 2.000 2.500 Khafrak Kurbal Mahin .. Marvdasht Sarvistan Total 4.000 10,000 2,500 10.000 8,000 140,000 The above area forms a segment of a circle of GO miles dia meter subtending an angle of about 100 °, and containing about 5 000 square miles; as about 60,000 of the nomad tribes live in this area in summer, it would appear that for half the year the density of population round Shiraz approaches 40 per square mile, for the other half of the year it would be rather less than 30. These figures speak eloquently of the comparative poverty of the district, and of its inability to absorb any large quantity of imports or to produce extensive exports. The commercial aspect15 of this question is examined Jater ; it is sufficient to say here that there seems to be an automatic limit to the amount of “grain that can be produced bv the individual farmer for export or sale, towards which the following factors contribute :—• ( 1 ) indolence ; the average Persian, at all events in Pars, has few wants and does not care to grow more grain than he needs for himself, and to sell in order to supply his simple needs ; ( 2 ) lack of ploughing cattle epidemics frequently devas tate the flocks and herds, and in many parts of the country, whilst there is unlimited land on which to grow unirrigated crops, grazing is very limited and this fact tends to restrict the size of .herds ; (3) difficulties of transport; lack ol baggage animals, for the same reasons as ( 2 ), and the insecurity of the roads. (4) taxation ;—whilst the mdliydt demanded by Govern ment from landlords is generally speaking very light, the Persian peasant is heavily burdened by the exac tions of these gentry, generally non-resident; after their demands have been met, and the kadWiudd has taken his share, not more than 20 per cent, of the crop, if as much, remains for the cultivator. The depredations and exactions of nomad tribes also fall on the peasant more heavily than on the landlord, and the former is often saved from starvation only by the fact that the latter is obliged to keep his tenants alive in order to obtain his village revenue. There is no indication that the population is increasing; on the contrary, everything tends to show that it is either stationary or decreasing. 23. Population of Shiraz .—A writer in the Farsnameh-i-Nasirr, published in 1895, quoting a census stated to have been taken in 1883, gives the total population of Shiraz at the latter date as, males 25,284, females 28,323, total 53,607.some of long standing. The population of the Shibkuh ports is predominantly Arab, as is also that of the Gabandi district. These Arabs are mostly Sunnis with a few Shiahs. They are bilingual and are gradually being absorbed by the stronger Persian element around them; they keep to their Arab dress, and, amongst themselves, to their own speech, and it is plain from their features and other physical characteristics that they are of a different racial type from their Persian neighbours. In the Behbehan and Haiat Baud districts and even further east will also be found colonies of Arabs, mostly Sunnis, with a few Shi’ahs from Hindi]an. The population of the coast is however for the most part Persian, but of a type quite distinct from that met with in Central Persia. They are Lurs, not unwarlike, of a good physique, and great agriculturists in the inland district. Those from the ports are much in demand as coolies in ports even as far afield as Karachi and Basrah. They are skilled sailors and fishermen, profes sions which employ a substantial proportion of their number, and, when trained and subjected to discipline, they would be in many res pects superior to lascars for work on board-ship. The crews of the Customs launches and of the Persian gunboat ‘ ‘ Persepohs ’ ’ are drawn from this source, and seem a useful and handy lot of men. The Gazetteer notes in Chapter VIII contain detailed remarks on the population of each district, and for further information on the subject the reader is referred thereto. 26. Of the Kuhgalu tribes no mention is necessary ; they are described in detail in Lieutenant Banking’s “ Notes on^ the Kuhgalu Tribes ” (I. B. 1910). The Mamassani and Boir Ahmadl, adjoining them to the east, are Lurs ; they are described in detail in Chapter III. It is enough to say here that they are the wildest of the nomad tribes and a menace to the civilized life of Pars, which can be removed by nothing but a well-organized punitive expedition, a consummation which would seem unlikely to materialize at present. 27. The Qashqal nomads are of Turkish origin and monopolize with the Kbamseh the lion’s share of political influence in Pars. They are sufficiently powerful to disregard the Persian Government, if it suits them to do so, but have been prevented hitherto by dissen sions among their chiefs from showing a united front; nor is there any sign that this state of things is likely to alter in the future. Physically they are perhaps the finest of the tribes of south-west Persia, except the Mamassani, who are said to be physically fine men. C361GSB . D18 Of the Khamseh or five tribes only the Shaibam and Jabbareh are of undoubted Arab origin and form the so-called Arab tribe They aggregate 15,000 tents and are ^immigrants of the VII Century A. D. from Arabia ; they still retain their ancient tongue. The origin of the remaining tribes is doubtful: all alike are marauders. 28. Lastly comes the sedentary population ; north of Shiraz : this is predominantly of old Persian stock; lacking enterprise, personal courage and the power of co-operation; these wretched villagers are the prey of the nomads, who have m recent years so despoiled them of their livestock and crops as to make it almost impossible for them to keep body and soul together ; these remarks also apply, though in less degree, to the population of the hasn, Sarvistan, Kavar and Khafr districts. South of Jahrum and Shiraz the villagers are more virile, with a strong admixture of Lur or nomad blood, and in Laristan the villagers are not less savage and predatory than the nomads. 29. The populations of the towns of Bushire and Shiraz are again well-defined types, and recognized as such all over Persia. That of Bushire is much mixed : Arabs, Persians, Lurs, and tribes of mixed blood, such as Behbehanis, have settled in the town and intermarried, forming a peculiar type; they wear peculiar dress, into which the kvlah does not enter. The townspeople of Shiraz are said to be less of a mixed Iranian type than is encountered elsewhere, but it is difficult to fix upon any feature as predominating or distinctive of them. The town population includes a certain number of Armenians. Shirazis are notably given to philosophical speculation, and the Babi movement has found widespread support in the town.(14- CHAPTER II. History of Fars. 30. Ancient History .—“ Fars or Farsistan” is the same word as “ Persis ', which, originally the title of the “ Empire ” of Iran only, has begotten the name which Europeans have, from remote times, applied to the whole. In this province were Pasargadae, Persepolis and Istakhr, the capitals of the Sassanian Kings, where they often resided, though favouring a more western capital, and where they have left, in close proximity to the palaces and tombs of their predecessors, the sculptured records of their own majestic rule. Here a succession of ambitious soldiers of fortune, springing as a rule‘from humble stock, found it possible, in the early disorganisation and ultimate atrophy of the unwieldy Empire of the Khallfs, to carve with their swords the scarcely-disguised reality of an independent kingdom. The first of these was Ya’qub-bin-Lais of Sistan, the founder of the Sufarl dynasty, in the latter part of the ninth century. After the Sufari came the Dillami or Al-i-Buiah family, whose founder was a fisherman. Next came the Seljuk invasion. A Turkish General was appointed Governor in Fars, who managed affairs so skilfully that his family provided seven successive Viceroys between 1066 and 1149. Sunkur-bin-Mudud, a Turkoman chieftain, threw off the Seljuk yoke in that year and proclaimed his oWn independence. It was during the reign of Abu Bakr that Sa’di, the poet, lived for 30 years at Shiraz, composed his “ GulGtan ' and “ Bustan ' and died. Next, Jangiz Khan, the Mongol, appeared on the scene and to him Abu Bakr was wis® enough to prefer his allegiance. The Atabeg line terminated with the son of Hulaku Khan, and Fars remained a Mongol province until Muba iz-ud-Din Muhammad founded the Muzaffari dynasty. In the reign of the fifth prince of this family, in 1387, Timur first came to Shiraz, in which town the poet Hafiz was then living. After the desolation of Timur’s empire Fars fell successively into the hands of the Turkoman Black Sheep and White Sheep dynasties; from them it passed with the rest of Persia under the sway of Shah Isma’Il, the fbunier of the Safavi royal line, since which time it has remained an appanage of the Persian crown. 31. Recent History.—IdOA In February 1904, ’Ala-ud-Dauleh was recalled to Tehran ; his successor Prince Shu’a-us-Saltaneh arrived at the end of June. Measles and cholera visited Shiraz and 19r 20 wrought consider able havoc among the poorer classes. JRuhddrl in one form or another was persistently levied throughout the piovince. Shua ’ -us-Saltaneh’ s oppressive and unscrupulous regime caused much unrest in Shiraz and a fanatical movement was directed against the Jews by Mirza Ibrahim, a leading Mulla. By order of Sardar- Akram, the Governor-General’s vazlr, the village of Kushk-i-Bidah belonging to Prince Jamal-ud-Din w r as plundered ; the incident &gt; gave rise to much popular indignation, which was increased by the arrest of Mirza-Agha-Hakim, a munshi of Qawam-ul-Mulk, on the grounds that he had assisted his master in appealing to Tehran against the misappropriation by the Governor-General of lands held by the Qawam in fief. 32. 1905.—Zargham-ud-Dauleh, who in June 1904 had been ousted from the position of Ilkhdni of the Qashqai in favour of his younger brother Saulat-ud-Dauleh, was thrown into chains in September 1905, the real reason being that he was believed to be intriguing with the Qawam-ul-Mulk against the Governor-General; soon afterwards his chains were removed and modified liberty allowed him. At the end of this month Shu’a-us-Saltaneh left for Europe, accompanied as far as Tehran by the Qawam-ul-Mulk ; ^ when he left Shiraz he was said to owe the Central Government nearly £20,000 on account of revenue, of which he had collected at least half. Shortly after his departure it became evident that the excesses of his administration had become intolerable, and that a widespread movement was on foot to prevent his return. 33. Mirza Ibrahim’s house was the scene of frequent meetings of the clergy and leading merchants ; the announcement of a Special Commissioner to enquire into their grievances incensed them still further, particularly when they learned that VazIr-i-Durbar, a creature of Sardar Akram, was nominated to the post. The ap pointment was cancelled as soon as made, but in—&gt; January 1906 VazIr-i-Makhsus arrived for the purpose. His powers, however, were not definitely stated or known, and it was clear that Shu’a-us-Saltaneh still hoped to return to Shiraz. The leaders of the popular movement were with great difficulty restrained from taking bast in His Majesty’s Consulate and would have done so, had not news been received that Iqbal-ud-Dauleh had been appointed Governor-General, a result which was ascribed to representations by His Majesty’s Legation. Jew-baiting, however, continued, and Iqbal-ud-Dauleh did not arrive ; Vazlr-i- Makhsus busied ^ himself in dislodging the Shu’a-us-Saltaneh’s family and the Sardar Akranq and in attempting to arrive at asettlement of the burning question at issue between Shu’a-us- Saltaneh and the people of Fars regarding certain crown lands, in cluding, as was contended, the main bazar of Shiraz, purchased by the Prince in 1905 from the Shah. 34. He was not successful, however, and in June the question had reached white-heat. A crowd of 300 or 400 notables and merchants took bast in the Residency gardens, and remained for nearly a fortnight, until they were partially reassured by the announcement through His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, that ’Ala-ud-Dauleh had been appointed Governor-General with full powers to deal with the question. He arrived early in June 1906 and was partially successful in dealing with this matter, and in restoring order on the Bushire-Shlraz road. A Persian of the old school, with, at heart, a distrust and dislike for all foreigners, he displayed at the outset strong personal hostility to His Majesty’s Consul, but subsequently assumed a very friendly attitude. He was recalled in November at the instigation of Shu’a-us-Saltaneh, much to the disappointment of the populace, who even attempted, at the bidding of the clergy and notables, to prevent his departure. The latter part of his administration was marked by a recrudes cence of road robberies. 35 . 1907.—He was succeeded temporarily by Prince Mu’aiyid- -ud-Dauleh who, pending his arrival, appointed Habibullah Khan (now Qawam-ul-Mulk) and Khabir-ud-Dauleh (of the Persian Telegraphs) as his deputies ; the latter was afterwards superseded by Nasr-ud-Dauleh, the Qawam’s younger son. Exactions on the Bushire road continued, though a greater degree of security was maintained. In February 1907 the news of the appointment of Prince Mu’aiyid-ud-Dauleh, with Qawam-ul-Mulk as his Yazir, became publicly known ; the latter, who jointly with his kinsman Nasfr-ul-Mulk had been retained in Tehran since the autumn of 1905, arrived in Shiraz in March and was well received. Nasr-ud- Dauleh was shortly afterwards appointed “ Rals-i-Qushun ” of Fars. The Qawam’s party seemed firmly established in power, but discontent and disaffection, the product in the main, it would seem, of the Constitutional agitations, which were then rife in Tehran, threatened to attain serious dimensions before long. 36. The condition of the Bushire-Shlraz road remained deplor able ; robberies were frequent ; the posts were regularly robbed and in no case was redress obtained ; an abnormal amount of wilful damage was perpetrated on the telegraph lines. ’Ala-ud-Dauleh practically closed the Church Missionary Society school in Shiraz by threatening to flog severely any boy attending it; on the22 other hand he facilitated in a large measure the settlement of numerous outstanding claims by a special official deputed by the Persian Government for the purpose. 37. Mn aiyid-ud-Dauleh arrived in April 1907 only to leave two months later. He was succeeded by the aged Husain Quli Khan, Nizam-us-Sultaneh, a man of some distinction and great wealth, with a reputation for firmness and capacity. The hopes raised by his appointment were, howeve.*, doomed to disappointment , his failure was scarce!} less complete than that of his predecessor, owing in the main to the political uncertainty, which arose out of the (onstitu- tional disturbances at Tehran. He left in Xovember 1907, Khablr- ud-Dauleh, Telegraph Master, acting in his stead. 38. The departure to Tehran of the Shiraz deputies in April 1907 was made the occasion for a great popular demonstration direct ed against the Qawami faction, and, for the first time, Saulat-ud- Dauleh entered the town at the head of a large body of Qashqal tribes men in support of the Constitutionalists; the disorders which follow ed lasted until the beginning of June, when popular demands were satisfied by the departure of Qawam-uI-Mulk for Tehran. Dis orders recommenced for a short time in August, but it was not until October that they attained serious dimensions, consequent on the arrival of Saiyid ’Abdul Husain, Lari, (or Shushtari); fighting con tinued steadily, uninterrupted by the arrival of the sons of the Qawam or Saulat’s departure in November, until January 7th, when a truce was patched up. Two months later, however, the town was thrown into the wildest disorder by the murder of Qawam- ul-Mulk by a man, who was said to be a servant of Mu’t xmid-ud-Di- wan; the outrage was followed by the attempted murder of the Qawam’s eldest son, when attending his father’s obsequies. The Qawamis were not. slow in wreaking vengeance on those alleged to be responsible for these outrages; one man, Saiyid Ahmad, Dashtaki, who was accused of the attempt on Salar-us-Sultan, was killed on the spot, his body burnt and his bones thrown into a well ; the other principal victim was a Mujtahid of some repute, by name Shaikh Muhammad Baqir. Shortly after this, His Koyal Highness Zill-us- Sultan arrived and succeeded in restoring order in a large measure in the province generally by arranging for the departure of the Qawam s sons to Europe, while the anger of the Shiraz populace was appeased by the execution of the two principal roughs of the Qawami faction. 39. The Qashqais .—Contests for the office of Hicham gave rise to some inter-tribal fighting during the year. In May 1907 Saulat- ud-Dauleh was superseded, 'by order of the Governor-General, by As ad-us-Sultaneh who, however, failed to enforce his authority23 on the tribe; Sauiat at once proceeded with his followers to Shiraz and pioclaimed his adherence to the popular party, to whose funds he contributed 800 tumdns, whilst promising the support of 400 horse men. A week later he came to blows, near Baiza, with his half brother the Zaigham-ud-Dauleh; 20 men are said to have been killed. Reconciliation followed, Sauiat being recognized as the 111,-ham, whilst Zaigham received pecuniary compensation on condition that he should take no part in tribal affairs. Dining 1907 Saulat-ud-Dauleh was assiduously courting the favour of the Governor-General, whilst his tribes were busy in devastating the country round Baiza. As soon as Nizam-us-Saltaneh left Shiraz Sauiat re-appeared in the politics of the town, sending a large body of tribesmen to assist the popular party, but himself remaining at Chinar Rahdar, whilst his tribesmen were pillaging the caravans on the Bushire-Shlraz road. He left for the low country in November. 40. The Khamseh. —Nasr-ud-Dauleh ceased to be “hakim” of the Arabs on his departure to Tehran in May 1907. He was succeed ed by Amir Aqa Khan, Mansur-us-Saltaneh, who was dismissed at the end of the same month, only to be reinstated as the result of the telegram of protest to His Majesty’s Consul, which was trans mitted to the Governor-General, the Arab headmen meanwhile tak ing bast in the Telegraph office at Dehbld. Amir Aqa Khan was, how ever, unable to prevent the tribes committing depredations on a large scale near Slvand. 41. The roads, —Robberies were of frequent occurrence on all roads during 1907. Kazarun was in a state of anarchy owing to the feud between Haidar Khan of Kamaiij and Khwajah Ibrahim Kaldn- tar of Kazarun: the Kunar Takhteh plain was the scene of numerous unusually bloody skirmishes, and for over a month no pest reached Shiraz from Bushire. On the Isfahan road ’Askar Khan, ’Arab,* was the principal offender. 42. 1908.—During the interregnum of Khablr-ud-Dauleh, a modus vivendi was established between the two parties, the Qawam- ul-Mulk on the one side, and the religious leaders wearing a mask of Constitutionalism on the other. In February 1908 the Wazlr-i- Makhsus, under the new title of Sahib Ikhtiyar, was appointed Gov ernor-General, only to be superseded by His Royal Highness Zill-us- Sultan, whose appointment was notified in March; Sahib Ikhtiyar, however, continued to hold office until the end of 1907. 43. In May 1908 the Zill-us-Sultan arrived ; the awe inspired by his name sufficed to keep the trade routes in excellent order even before he arrived. He failed to impose any effective control upon such tribes as the Kuhgalu and LashanI, nor did he do much to * He was executed in 1913.24 settle British claims ; it must be remembered, however, that he found the province in a state of complete disorganization and that he was actually in Shiraz for only two months He was dismissed a te, the Shah’s coup d’etat in July, and with his departuie vanislud all hope ot a stable government. 44. Asaf-ud-Dauleh, who had previously occupied the post in 1902 was appointed in his stead ; the news of his appointment was received with derision and on his arrival in September 1_908 his orders were treated with contempt. His Deputy, Sardar Firuz, arrived on July 16th and continued to administer affairs with a single eye to his own profit until the arrival of his chief. 45. The Arab tribes were placed by the Zill-us-Sultan under tl e control of bis son Akbar Mirza, the Mu’tamid-ud-Divan, an old enemy of the Qawamm, being/nsA&amp;Jr; the principal result of this was the latter’s murder by Muhammad Quli Khan, brother of ’As kar Khan, though the victim was at the head of 800 men and two guns. This murder coincided with the dismissal of the Zill-us-Sul tan and the appointment of Asaf-ud-Dauleh,who arrived in Shiraz about the same time as the Qawaml brothers; the latter’s services were at once requisitioned by the Governor-General. The elder bro ther, Salar-us-Sultan, was despatched against Saiyid ’Abdul Husain, Lari, who had raised the standard of revolt against the Shah; Nasr- ud-Dauleh was entrusted with the task of restoring order amongst the Arabs. They were also called upon to pay large sums of money in aid of the local treasury ; both brothers met with very indifferent success in their respective missions, a fact which induced some mer chants to endeavour to provoke an agitation against the Governor- General. The movement, however, being unaided by cash subsidies, collapsed, as also did an attempt on the part of the Mullas to start a movement against Muhammad ’All Shah after his co?/p d'etat. All evidence points to the conclusion that the Constitutional move ment was never a genuine one in Shiraz. Saiyid ’Abdul Husain was at the end of 1908 strongly established at Lar, having inflicted a severe defeat on a force of Arabs sent againt him under ’Askar Khan. 46. The Qashqals were too busy pursuing the tribal industry of highway robbery to devote much attention to internecine feuds; their raids extended as far afield as Khorasan and Kirman. Sau- lat-ud-Dauleh remained llkhdni throughout the year, and did his best to efface the memory of his adherence to the popular party durir g the previous year by dancing attendance on the Governor-General, and by showing activity in the collection of revenues ; for these services he was given the title of Sardar-ul-’Ashair. The Zaigham- au l e h continued to intrigue against his younger brother and hos tilities appeared imminent in October 1908 when he obtained the25 support of the Shishbuluki tribes; Saulat-ud-Dauleh, however, obtained the mastery without recourse to fighting, and the Zaigham was obliged to take refuge with Nasr-ud-Dauleh. 47. The Boir Ahmad! and Kuhgalu maintained their activity on the trade routes ; robberies of caravans were of frequent occurrence and the Ispahan road was completely closed for about ten days: ti e post was robbed repeatedly and two postmen were murdered, as also was the only capable headman along the road. 48. 1909.—Asaf-ud-Dauleh was dismissed in July and the Zill- us-Sultan nominated, but the Bakhtiari coup d’etat in Tehran was fatal to his appointment and he was replaced in the same month by ’Ala-ud-Dauleh. This event brought Saulat-ud-Dauleh to fighting point and he declared categorically that 'Ala-ud-Dauleh should not enter Fars as Governor General. He also showed himself disposed to maintain his puppet Asaf-ud-Dauleh in power, but was prevented by pressure brought to bear by the British Consulate ; he secured, how ever, the appointment of the ’Ain-ud-Dauleh, who, however, had to make room only four days later for Sahham-ud-Dauleh. 49. Sahham-ud-Dauleh showed himself without delay to be a most remarkable type of Persian ; he arrived on September 20 th en tirely without guards and, when a force of 120 Persian Cossacks arrived, his authority seemed secured. His extremely independent attitude commended itself, however, neither to the religious leaders nor to Saulat, whose dismissal he attempted to secure, but without success. The end of his regime was consequently imminent and he was dismissed in January 1910. His rule was an excellent blend of ancient principles with modern practice ; he kept administration in his own very capable hands, uniting an extraordinary personal energy with an equally unusual administrative capacity, thus the ne\v Constitutional experiment in Shiraz was in hands which were not only strong but clean. Its failure in such hands must be regard ed as definitive. His gravest error of judgment was the nomination of the Nasr-ud-Dauleh as Deputy Governor, in December 1909, an appointment which was no enhancement of the latter’s dignity ; while it gave gratuitous offence to Saulat-ud-Dauleh. 50. The Lari Saiyid continued to give trouble ; the Qawam-ul- Mulk and Nasr-ud-Danleh spent much time and money operating against him, and finally, on May 12 th, took Lar; the Saiyid disap peared ; elaborate ceremonies, planned on the gratuitous assumption that he had been murdered, fanned popular agitation against the Qawamis, and the Lar! Saiyid and Saulat-ud-Dauleh both announced their intention of coming to Shiraz to root out the Qawamis, who C361GSB B26 replied by circulating news of their intention of bringing in several thousand Arabs for their defence. 51 iqio —.During the following year the situation continued to go from bad to worse. The local authorities had failed to take any punitive action in connection with the attack on the Russian Consul-General’s party and lawlessness was at a premium. His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz was_ of opinion that the only remedv would be a British punitive expedition, but tliisi \ lev did not commend itself to higher authority. In February a league was formed between the Shaikh of Muham- mareh, the Wah of Pusht-i-Kuh and Saulat-ud-Dauleh, of the Qashqii, under the name of “League of the South.” While pro fessing high Constitutional aims, this league was really directed against the growing power of the Bakhtiari under Sardar Assad and as such acted as a useful warning, if accomplishing nothing more. 52. The Kazarun route remained closed throughout the year, the Saulat-ud-Dauleh having been successful in forcing traffic on to the Jirreh route, in spite of the objections of the whole commercial com munity. 53. Zafar-us-Saltaneh succeeded Sahham-ud-Dauleh in Feb ruary, but, after showing his incompetence for 5 months, he was dismissed in July. During the interregnum which followed, Qawam-ul-Mulk acted as Governor-General, an appointment much resented by the Saulat- ud-Dauleh. 51. In April Mr. J. H. Bill, I.C.S., having made over charge of the Consulate at Shiraz to Mr. Smart, proceeded on leave via the north. He was attacked between Abadeh and Shfdgistan by robbers and lost two sowars, though not before his escort had killed two of their assail ants. 5o. During September the situation in Fars became worse. Finally, on October 14th the patience of His Majesty’s Government having been exhausted, His Majety’s Minister was authorised to present ... Note to the Persian Government to the effect that, if order were not restored on the Bushire-Shiraz-Ispahan road within three months, we should insist on the formation of a force of road guards under British officers. This step roused the Persian Government momentarily, ai rsizam-us-Saltaneh was appointed Governor-General. The Persi; Government at the same time undertook to supply him with am] funds for the creation of a special Corps of Road Guards.27 (IS) 56. 1911.—Nizam-us-Saltaneh arrived at Busliire in January and was met by the Saulat-ud-Dauleh at the head of several hundred Qashqai tribesmen. The Nizam-us-Saltaneh was an able but unscrupulous man with large interests in South-West Persia, which, it was hoped, would enable him to keep the balance between the contending factions. His calculations were upset, however, by the Saulat's action in com ing to meet him in Bushire, and on his arrival in Shiiaz in April he was already committed to hostility to the Qawami faction, against whom he w'as further prejudiced by old family grievances. He had the Qawaml brothers arrested on April 15th and an nounced his intention of trying them on various criminal charges, some punishable with death. An appeal to the Government in Tehi an, strongly backed by the Bakhtlari faction, resulted in an order for their release on condition that they left Kars for Europe. On May 7 th they left Shiraz with an escort of 50 sov r ars and w r ere ambushed the same day near Khan-i-Zinian on the first stage out. Nasr-ud-Dauleh', who v r as ahead and mounted on a mule, was killed, but Qawam-ul-Mulk, who v r as riding on a horse some dis tance behind, escaped and, galloping off, managed to reach the British Consulate by circuitous routes next day. There is little doubt that Nizam-us-Saltaneh and the Saulat were both concerned in this murder. The latter, a man of boundless ambition, v r as bent on profiting by the disorders reigning in the pro vince and forcing himself into the same predominant position, as a tribal Chief, as that held by the Shaikh of Muhammareh and the Bakhtiari Khans in their respective limits. 57. By the middle of July hostilities had broken out between the Nizam’s adherents in Shiraz and those of the Qawam headed by his wife and only son. During August and September contingents of Qashqals and Arab and Baharlu tribesmen began to arrive in support of their sepa rate factions and by the middle of September some 1,200 Qashqais were engaged in continual desultory fighting entrenched in the com mercial quarter of the towm against an equal number of Arabs out side. The Nizam had been dismissed in July, but did not finally leave the town till October 4th, when the Saulat-ud-Dauleh withdrew his forces prior to moving irdo winter quarters. The casualties Sustained by the rival factions during these three months’ hostilities are estimated by rehable authorities at not e228 less than 460 killed and many more wounded. Not only was great damage to property committed, but tribal enmities have been aroused, which will be remembered a generation or more, while the prestige of the Central Government has received a blow from which it wull be difficult to recover. 58. Until April the condition of the Bushire-Shiraz road was fairly satisfactory, though occasionally closed by the Nizam’s operations at Kamarij. Frequent robberies, however, occurred between Shiraz and Ispahan. During the summer, the situation momentarily improved, but by October the Bushire-Shiraz road was again completely closed, and on the Shiraz-Ispahan road robberies on a large scale v'ere of frequent occurrence. On October 12 th a large caravan with over £2.000 of British goods w T as robbed near Abadeh by Kuhgalu tribesmen and Miss Ross, a medical practitioner, maltreated. A few days later a body of 300 Persian soldiers w r as attacked near Yazdikhast, losing 10 killed and 20 wounded. On October 30th Miss Ross, w r hen attempting to continue her* journey to Shiraz, was again attacked, stripped and maltreated. She was ultimately brought in from Abadeh by a squadron of the 39 th Central India Horse, w T ho had been sent to escort her. t Owing to the appointment of the Nizam-us-Saltaneh and the announcement of Persia's intention to establish an effective Road Gendarmerie under Swedish officers, a further respite had been al lowed to the Persian Government regarding the formation of a local force serving under Birtish officers for the policing of the Bushire- Shiraz-Isfahan route, as foreshadowed in the British note of October 1910. The recent constant robberies on the road, however, led to a reconsideration of the outlook. On October 10 th the Persian Gov ernment were informed that, owing to the insecurity at Shiraz and elsewhere, His Majesty s Government 'were compelled to strengthen the Consular Guards at Shiraz, Isfahan and Bushire. The Per sian Government were, however, assured that the Consular escorts would only be utilised for the protection of British lives and property and the Consulates at Bushire, Shiraz and Isfahan, and that if the Persian Government could devise a scheme for the effective pro tection of the trade routes, the troops would not patrol the roads Two squadrons of the 39th (King George’s Own) Central India Horse, under Lieutenant-Colonel J. A. Douglas, arrived at Bushire29 (m on October 27th and reached Shiraz without further incident on November 12 th. The third and fourth squadrons disembarked at Bushire on November 11 th and one full squadron proceeded on to Shiraz. On November 18th the squadron for Isfahan left for that place accompanied b^ an additional 100 men as far as Abadeh for the escort to Miss Ross. Both parties arrived at their respective destinations on Decem ber 5th. AVhile Miss Ross's escort met with no incidents on their return journey, the Isfahan squadron fell in with a party of robbers beyond Yazdikhast with the result that Risaldar-Major Ghulam Muhammad was severely wounded in the leg, two of the robbers being also wounded. A party of 30 men of the 79th Carnatic Infantry, who left Shiraz on November 28th for Bushire^ arrived without mishap at their des tination, but a caravan a short distance ahead of them was attacked and looted between Khan-i-Zinian and Dashtarjan. On December 19th a third and last detachment of 50 men of the Central India Horse left Bushire for Shiraz with Mr. Smart, who was rejoining his post as Consul at Shiraz from leave. A similar party left Shiraz at the same time under Major Bird- wood to join hands at Kazarun. This party was fired on from the Kutal-i-Dukhtar pass and one sowar killed. This outrage was organised by Muhammad 'All Khan of the Kashkuli section of Qashqals and Deputy Governor of Kazarun. Colonel Douglas at once despatched a second party of 50 men to hold the top of the pass for the return journey. On December 26th Major Bird wood’s party left Kazarun to effect a junction with the party under Lieutenant Fraser from Bushire. The junction was effected without mishap, but, on returning to Kazarun together, the party was treacherously fired on from a cara- vansarai. This was a signal for a general attack by about 800 tribes men, mostly inhabitants of the villages in the Kazarun plain. Two followers were killed and seven sowars wounded, while a hospital assistant and one follower were missing. Mr. Smart, who was riding some way behind, was slightly wounded, and, falling from his horse, was captured and taken into Muhammad ’All Khan’s camp. He was well treated and sent in on December 9th. The squadron fought their way into Kazarun, where they were no further molested.30 « The force left Kazarun on January 2nd, joining up with Colonel Douglas, who had moved out to the Kutal-i-Dukhtar to meet them, and reached Shiraz without further mishap on January 5th. 59 This outbreak may be largely attributed to the cupidity of the nomad chiefs, who feared that the restoration of order along the roads by our troops would involve the loss of blackmail, which the various Khans along the road had come to regard as a permanent ^ source of income. It was, however, unfortunate that the Consulate in Shiraz, by bein' compelled to give “ bast ” to the Qawam, had become in the eves &amp; of the Qashqai tribesmen pledged to his support. There was consequently a widespread belief that the ulterior object of the arrival of British troops was to attack the Qashqai and curb the licence they had enjoyed for some years. The landing also synchronized with a general feeling in Islam of antagonism to Christendom in geneial, and in Persia of violent resentment against Russian action in Northern Persia and in a less degree against us in the South on account of our apparent concurrence in her doings and a suspicion of our own designs in regard to the South. This feeling had been considerably augmented by the Mullas and local press. Subsequent events have proved that the excitement caused by the despatch of British troops to Shiraz was but of a temporary nature. GO. 1912.—After the departure of the Nizam-us-Saltaneh from Shiraz in October of the preceding year the post of Governor-General was held by the Qawam-ul-Mulk pending any fresh appointment being made from Tehran. Early in November 'Ala-ud-Dauleb, who had previously r twice held the post with some success, was appointed. He was, however, assassinated at Tehran in December before he had started to take up the position. Early in 1912 Mirkhbir-us-Saltaneh was appointed, but he did not reach Shiraz till October 16th. He was a man with but little experience of the administration of so backward and turbulent a province as Ears, but he showed himself anxious to hold aloof from local factions. His attitude of impartiality was facilitated by the resignation of Zaigham-ud-Dauleh, half brother of the Saulat, of the llkhaniship of the Qashqais, to which post he had been appointed by Ala-ud-Dauleh and the Qawam under the title of Sardar Ihtisham.31 The Saulat was lemstated as Ill'll dm, but solely as a tribal chief and without any invitation to take part in the administiation of the province. The Daria Begi, late Governor of the Gulf Ports, accompanied Mukhbir-us-Saltaneh as Commander of his Military Forces. 61. On account of the attack on Mr. Smart’s escort, the headquar ters of the 79th Carnatic; Infantry, then about to return to India from Makran and consisting of 200 men under Lieutenant-Colonel Andrews, were landed at Bushire in the last days of December. They were relieved in the following November by a wing of the 2nd Queen Victoria’s Own Ra jput Light Infantry under Major Dunsford. During the year various measures were discussed by His Majesty’s Government for the despatch of a punitive force to Pars lo exact reparation for the numerous outrages of the preceding year and to secure the security of the Southern routes. On October 5th the squadron at Isfahan was withdrawn to Shiraz, where it arrived without incident cn 22nd October. On the 11 th December a party of 26 sowars of the Central India Horse With 17 followers and 17 baggage mules under Major Kettlewell, accompanied by Captain Eckfoid, had proceeded for some days’ shooting to the Dashtarjan Lake, 40 miles from Shiraz. The party left with the consent of ihe Governor-General, who considered the district safe, as it was supposed to be under the protection of the Swedish Gendarmerie. The party u r as, however, ambushed between Khan-i-Zinian and Dashtarjan by a large body of tribes men, estimated at between 200 and 300 men. Early in the ambus cade Captain Eckford w r as shot through the heart. Unlike previous attacks on British officers during the year, robbery seems to have been the sole motive and the ambuscade formed part of operations against a large caravan, which had left Khan-r-Zinian in front of the party. The robbers, of whom two v'ere killed and three w T ounded, appeared to have been composed of a mixed band of Boir Ahmadis, Mamassanis and Kashkulis, the raid being undertaken with the cognizance of Muhammad 'All Khan KashkuK. The party returned to Shiraz without further molestation, but of a party of Gendarmes in the neighbourhood four were wounded. 62. As previously narrated, the Persian Government had intimated their intention in 1911 of forming a Gendarmerie under Swedish officers for tne protection of the trade routes.32 The Swedish officers engaged arrived in Tehran m the autumn of 1911. By February 1912 one officer had been sent to Shiraz, to be followed a month or so later by two more. It was not, however, till August that any attempt was made by the Swedish officers to put the force they were engaged in raising to any practical test. In August, however, Major Siefvert and Captain Nystrom with 80 mounted, 180 foot Gendarmes and one mountain gun marched towTX DWgun, about 20 miles S.-S -W of Shiraz whete they encountered a force said to be acting under the instructions of the Saulat-ud-Dau leh. The greater part of the infantry Gendarmerie fled without firing a shot and were captured with their arms. The remainder stayed rather reluctantly with the Swedish officers and fought for some time, but ineffectually. The breech block of the gun blew up and the gun was soon out of action. Major Siefvert was wounded in the thigh and the tribesmen eventually withdrew. On December 18th two Swedish officers, Major Brandel and Captain Nystrom, arrived at Bushire from Shiraz for the purpose of enlisting recruits for the Gendarmerie. These they hoped to utilise on the Bushire-Shiraz road in the spring of 1913. Having regard to the importance attaching to the attitude of the Qashqai tribes in any military work dealing on Ears, a separate account of their history by Mr. H. G. Chick, Vice-Consul at Bushire, is attached below. Past History of Qdshqdis and their Khans. 63. There would appear to be practically no records of the history of the Qashqais fiom the time of their settlement in Ears after the invasion of Janghiz Khan, right down to the end of the eighteenth century, when the “ Turks ” were, according to tradition, a number of nomad units without central organization. There is no evidence as to the side which they supported in the war between the rival Qajar, Afghan and Zend Khans, except that Hassan Khan and his brother Isma/il Khan, of the Shahilo (Shamlon) branch, are said to have been “ confidential advisers ” of the great Karim Khan, Zend, monarch of Southern Persia in 1760. 64. Jam Khan, son of Tsma’il Khan, is credited with having con solidated all clans of the Qashqai, brought in units scattered in dis tant districts or in other tribal organizations, and was of sufficient influence to make them feudally subservient to his family’s interests and leadership. He thus acquired the title of llhegi and later33 llkhani (a title used by the Turkomans in Khorasan) and properties such as Janiabad between Kazarun and Jirreh besides inheriting the leadership of the Qashqais, while his influence must have been considerable with the Qajar Prince Governors of Pars. His second son, Muhammad 'All Khan, 2 nd llkhani, married the daughter of Prince Firman Firma, son of Path ’AH Shah, in 1824, and was evidently a power in Pars. After a quarrel with his father- in-law in 1829 (?) he took the whole II away with him to the prov ince of Kirman. Manuchehr Khan, Vazir of Pars, sent him to Tehran in 1832, whence he returned only in 1847. His eldest son, wiio became Ilbegi, married a daughter of His Majesty Muhammad Shah, and w r as given high command, and his brother-in-law, Prince Mu’tamid-ud-Dauleh, protected the tribal chiefs. 65 Various members of the ruling family have at different periods been up in arms against the Government: the 3 rd son of the first llkhani was in rebellion in Qrr and Karzin in 1831, and died in imprisonment at Shiraz in 1831. Though the fourth son of the first llkhdni and grandfather of the present generation of Ilkhdnis died fighting for His Royal High ness Firman Firma at Kirman, Suhrab Khan, his son/got into trouble with the Government towards the end of his life, w*as taken to Tehran and executed about 1873. 66 . Muhammad Qrrlr Khan, 3rd llkhdni, with a large body of tribesmen appeared on the plains of Dashtistan to fight the British army in 1856, but, according to Qashqar accounts, scorned to serve under a Nuri Commander-in-Chief and deserted. Sultan Muham mad Khan, 4th llkhdni, Was a weak ruler, without control, and many of the smaller clans were ruined and absorbed by larger branches. 67. Hajr Nasrullah Khan, 5th llkhdni, left one son, whose defi ciencies and failings made him unfit to succeed his father, and the succession passed to the sons of Darab Khan, brother of Suhrab Khan. Hajr Nasrulkh’s daughter was married to the present Qawam-ul- Mulk—a fact that has given rise to much of the hostility between the llkhdni Saulat-ud-Dauleh and the Qawam’s adherents. 68 . In 1898 the eldest son of Darab Khan, Zargham-ud-Dauleh succeeded as 6 th llkhdni: he was noted as a man of fine stature and presence, and popular with the tribesmen, largely because of his • leniency and indifference to the payment of revenue or to the management of the ‘ tirehs the chiefs of sonre of which developed considerable independence. Unfortunately this was largely the C361GSB r34 result of great slackness and over-indulgence in spirits and opium and his early death in 1905 may be attributed to the same cause. He was however, at logger-heads with both Firman Firma and His Imperial Highness Shu’a-us-Saltaneh, and, in consequence of the ktter Prince’s displeasure and intrigues, he was more or ess de tained at Shiraz for some time before his death. _ During his lifetime his full brother, Saulat-ud-Dauleh, had several times acted as and for a short period in 1902 replaced him as miiani. 69. About this period the late Qawam-ul-Mulk had powerful influence in Pars: Prince Shu’a-us Saltaneh had humiliated him, and patronized Saulat-ud-Dauleh. As is often the custom in Persian politics, no sooner had the Prince vacated the Governor-Generalship in 1906) than Qawam-ul-Mulk, left as Acting Governor-General, vented his spleen on Saulat-ud-Dauleh by conferring the of the Q.'ishqais on Zaigham-ud-Dauleh, son of Darab Khan by a peasant wife, partly on the ground that the former had not paid the tribal tax. Zaigham happened to be the elder brother by a few months, and there was no love lost between the two. The local provincial Majlis, then recently instituted, asked Qawam-ul-Mulk to give Saulat-ud-Dauleh some days’ grace to come in and pay, on or after the expiry of which he suddenly arrived in Shiraz : but Qawam had already despatched Zaigham with a force of Qashqals partial to his cause and of Bo r Ahmadis to take charge of the //, which was then on the upward migration not far from Shiraz. Saulat-ud-Dauleh’s supporters included Muhammad ’All Khan Qaskuli, his brothers and Ayyaz Kiha Khan, Darashurl: with Zaigham were Muhammad Hasan Khan, Kashkfdi, an enemy of Saulat’s, Agha Kiha Khan, Darashurl and Karim Khan of the Boir Ahmadi. A fight took place near Kudian : Zaigham’s force was routed and he had to flee from bars, but Qalb Ali Khan, brother of Muhammad ’Ali Khan, Kashkull, and Alamdar Khan, Kashkuli, brother-in-law of Saulet-ud-Dauleh, were among the killed. Meanwhile agitation in Shiraz against the Qawam had been so strong that he was recalled to Tehran. The bitter enmity between the Qawaims and a section of the Qashqals may be largely ascribed to this incident. Zaigham-ud-Dauleh’s full brother ’Ali Khan is allied by marriage to the Bakhtiari Khans, and they found protection and support with them. Recent History of the Qdshqdl and their Khans. 70. From 1907-1910 Saulat-ud-Daulch made good his position of authority in the II with remarkable force and success. He actecl117 V. 35 y* A as his own Ilbegi, and proceeded to acquire by purchase, or seize as his own inheritance, rich properties at Flruzabad, Farrashband, Jam, Qir and Karzin, etc. He became the richest magnate in Furs, and attached the large body of ’Amaleh to his own person. Owing to his greed for money (a fault common among all great land- owners in Fars) and his insistence on full payment of ‘ maliat ’ by the tribes, he has alienated the sympathies of many chiefs of ‘ tirehs ; ’ the severity with which he had been wont to dismiss the Kaldntars, who incurred his displeasure, and appoint others, also did him harm. For two years or more he completely crushed Ahmad Khan, Shish- buluki, father-in-law of Zaigham, who had become a man of import ance during the reign of Za gham-ud-Dauleh : at different times he dismissed, or fought, the Kaldntars of the Farsimaidan and Ja’farbegl. By 1910 he had fallen out with a chief supporter, Muhammad ’All Khan, Kashkuli and with the powerful Kaldntar of the Dara- shuri. The II, however, recovered its former cohesion and unity under his rule, and, much as he was disliked, he was undoubtedly greatly feared by the Qashqal. 71. The institution of so-called‘‘Constitutional Government” had by 1909 brought chaos into Fars affairs, and nullified the authority of the Governor-General—a situation of which the Qash- qais were not slow to take advantage. By nature the tribesmen are of a thieving disposition, but out side the period of the two migrations when their passage covers certain portions of the caravan route, they had not been in the habit of molesting caravans or travellers. They now began to feel their strength, which they soon realized lay in their numbers and the opportunities for general arming provided by the Arms Traffic to Tangistan and Shibkuh ports. 72. In 1909 Saulat-ud-Dauleh with a large force threatened to attack and occupy Shiraz, partly on the ground that his enemies the Qawamis were reactionaries and himself desirous of setting up a constitutional regime in Shiraz, but more particularly because he refused to allow ’Ala-ud-Dauleh to be sent as Governor-General. The same year he caused caravans to Bushire to be diverted to the Firuzabad route which passes through Qashqai country, and under took for heavy remuneration from merchants to protect caravans from robbery. F 236 73. I n 1910 fresh trouble arose owing to the turbulence of the tribes and Saulat, and to the fact that his Bakhtlarl enemies were in power in Tehran : Zaighani-ud-Dauleh was sent back to Shiiaz to resume the lead of the tribe, but met with a cold reception from the Qashqais, and had to retire when the Governor-General espoused the cause of Saulat-ud-Dauleh. The llkhdni had in the spring declined orders to undertake responsibility for the “ Imperial ” caravan route via Kazarun, unless certain governorships, i.e., Kazarun and Behbehan, were given to him as appanages. He now in the autumn returned to power, guaranteed the safety of the road, and his nominees were posted in Kazarun and Behbehan. The Farsimaidan, however, broke loose from restraint on the downward migration and created great pestruction and havoc along a portion of the telegraph wires near Dashtcrjan. » The appointment of Nizam-us-Saltaneh as Governor-General of Ears was welcomed by Saulat-ud-Dauleh, whose interests and policy were in many respects similar to those of Nizam. In January 1911 j together with Saulat-us-Saltaneh, his younger brother, he took the unusual step of coming to Bushire with several hundred tribes men to greet the new Governor-General. He had obliged the Khans of Burazjan, AhmadI and other places on the main caravan route to pay him large monetary tribute. Kamarij stood in his way and was coveted also by the Kashkuli Khans, whose winter quarters march with the Kamarij district. After despatching a force of Qashqais to assist in Nizam’s punish ment of Tangistiin, the llkhdni turned some of his tribesmen on Kamarij, but gained little success. At the end of 1910 he had again undertaken responsibility for the security of the caravan route via Kazarun and he sent Muhammad ’All Khan, Kashkuli, against the Mamassani tribes, authors of extensive robberies on the road. His relations with this Kaldntar were, however, far from cordial. 74. -In 1911 realizing that he had many enemies among his chiefs and relatives, Saulat-ud-Dauleh skilfully appointed Saulat-us- Saltaneh, his brother, as Ilbegi with charge over the internal affairs of the Qashqal: this was to keep his brother from intriguing against himself. At the end of April 1911 occurred the attack on the QaWamI brothers by Nizam-us-Saltaneh, and the murder of the younger, in which the tribesmen were implicated, probably with the Ilkhdni’s approval and incitement.4 . 37 75. It is undeniable that Saulat-ud-Dauleh had the power, when his pocket was properly compensated and no intrigues were on foot against him, to maintain order and security on the caravan route, for, apart from his successful control of the Firuzabad and Jirreh routes, he substantially alleviated the position of merchants in Shiraz and Isfahan during the summer of 1911 by undertaking ^ the protection of caravans which passed up by the “ Sarhadd ” road through his tribal country to Qumisheh and Isfahan. When, however, the tribes returned to their downward migra tion in September 1911, Saulat-ud-Dauleh supplied a large force of riflemen to carry on Nizam’s faction fight against Qawam-ul-Mulk’s ad .erents : but the successful irruption of the Khamseh ll, on behalf of the Qawami party, dealt a severe blow to Saulat-ud- Dauleh’s prestige and he retired to his property at Chah-i- Kazlmeh, in Qir and Karzin, taking with him the large Darashuri clan, instead of allowing them to proceed in the direction of Behbehan as usual. Meanwhile the Kashkuli Khans combined against him under the v aegis of the Qawam-ul-Mulk and ’Ala-ud-Dauleh, nominated Governor-General of Ears, and on Saulat’s resignation of respon sibility for the Bushire-Shlraz caravan route, the Khans wero« entrusted with it by Qawam. In these circumstances the Bakhtiarl Government in Tehran and ’Ala-ud-Dauleh despatched for the second time Zaigham-ud- Dauleh, with the title of Sardar Ihtisham, to take over the Ilkhdni- ship of the tribes. 76. After the autumn migration of 1911 the executive power over the clans was wielded by the llbegl, Saulat-us-Saltaneh (now Amir ’Ashadr), who gathered together a number of the more important 4 , chiefs of clans at Farrashband, near Kazarim. He was, apparently, not without aspirations to the Ilkhdniship. 77. However, early in 1912, Zaigham-ud-Dauleh arrived at Kazaranwith a nondescript following : was joined by the Kashkuli Khans, hostile to Saulat-ud-Dauleh, and after a little hesitation most of the chief Kaldntars went over to Zaigham. 78. It is noteworthy that there has been a general disposition for territorial aggrandisement on the part of the ‘ tirehs ’ lying near the caravan route. The Kashkulis in 1909 invaded the coast plain near Daliki to take forcible possession of the Mazara’I district: the Kashkuli Khans are now Governors of Kazarun and the Shahpur38 Dlain. In 1912 thev were watching every opportunity of seizing Kamkrij from its present possessor, and their last move was to claim the sub-government of Khisht and encroach on the Khidit an&lt; Kunar Takhteh plain from the Mulla Anar pass and Malatun lulls. Thev had allied to them the Dushman-ziari branch of the Mamas- sani tribes, and had brought them as guards on the upper part of the route near Shiraz : they were in touch with leaders of the Boir Ahmadi. The Farsimaidan, whose camping grounds lie to the east of the Kamari] plain, have (1913) for the past two autumns shown them selves wantonly and intentionally destructive of telegraph property between Khan-i-Zinian and Pul-i-Abgineh. Their Kalantars are also trying to seize as personal property villages on the Ivazaiun plain.CHAPTER III. The Nomad Tribes of Ears. (1) Nomad Tribes—(2) Comparison with other tribes of S.-W. Persia— (3) Individual tribes—Boir Ahmadi, Chehar-jRahl, Khamseh, Lashani, Mamassani— (4) Qashqal: Habitat, numbers, customs and organization, migrations, tribal sections, notes on sections, genealogy of Khans. Note.— This Chapter has been compiled principally from a recent report by Mr. H. G. Chick, Commercial Adviser to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, in 1911, supple mented by notes made by Captain A. T. W ilson, Political Department, in 1911. The Nomad Tribes of Ears. 79. The principal nomad tribes of Pars are the Qashqal and Khamseh tribes, the former Turks, the latter partly Arabs of mixed origin. Of secondary importance are the Mamassani, Boir Ahmadi and Lashani who take no part in provincial politics, but, like the others, v indulge freely in highway robbery ; the last two-named exercising their talent in this direction, not only in h ars, but as far afield as the provinces, and neighbourhood of Isfahan, Kirman and Aazd. All these tribes, whose total numbers are estimated at^ something under 77,000 tents, are described in detail below. The role of Khamseh and Qashqal in the politics of Ears is Touched on in the preceding chapter on recent events m I ais, in w hit h is added a short history of the Qashqal \ it is sufficient here to note the (auses which have enabled the tribes to attain their present predominant position, and to remark on some of the more important differences between them and other tribes in South-West Persia. 80. Always lawdess, and seldom completely under the control of ^ the Central Government, the nomads of Ears were nevertheless seldom a source of serious anxiety to the Governor-General of Ears, until the last decade of the XIX Century. They were ill-armed, and in consequence unable to withstand Government tioops under proper leadership i they even furnished military forces to Govern ment ; above all, their forces were uneducated and disunited. 81. In 1892 the late General Gordon estimated that the Qashqal possessed 200 Martinis: by 1900 they possessed something like 2,000, but magazine rifles were still rarities, and European firms had not yet taken up the trade in earnest at Masqat. The tribes were 3940 already getting out of hand, and were failing to pay the revenue with any regularity, but the prestige of Government, which in all Eastern countries is an asset of enormous value, still prevented oveit acts of rebellion. With the rearming of the tribes, the restraining influence of their chiefs seems to have declined, and the more powerful sections found themselves able to bargain with rival chiefs who sought their support. During 1896-1897 considerable numbers of arms were import ed into Persia from Masqat, and by 1900-1910 the tribes were practically rearmed with magazine rifles and modern Martinis, the former largely predominating during the last few years. Scarcely less than a million tumans (£ 200 , 000 ) must have been spent on arms by the tribes of Pars alone, whilst the Central Government probably spent considerably less. The main points of difference between the QashqaI and other tribes of South-West Persia, viewed as political entities. 82. The Qashqal are under the leadership of an llkhdni appointed from the ruling family by the Persian Government, who generally appoints one of his relatives as Ilbegl to assist him in internal affairs. In this they resemble the Bakhtiari and the Sagwand. These officials derive their authority with the tribes, mainly from the fact that, as they are responsible for the tribal revenue, they are in a position to bring pressure to bear on all sections of the tribe, with the support, when necessary', of the Persian Government. The possession or deprivation of the title of llkhdni does not, however, nowadays necessarily carry with it the submission of it, or loss of power, among all clans. The Kaldntars of the tirehs or clans are appoint ed by llkhdnls. The personal restraining influence of the llkhdni and Ilbegl varies considerably and at present is not very strong. They have no machinery for enforcing obedience to their orders; for they have to deal through the tribal headmen, who enjoy a great measure of independence. It is not thus with the Bakhtiari Khans, who have at their disposal some twenty or thirty vounger Khans, and a fair standing force of sowars, who are available for despatch in various directions, to enforce the authority of the older Khans. Nor are the Qashqal (or Khamseh) chiefs of the same personal status as the Bakhtiari Khans of the present generation. Long sojourns m Tehran, visits, in many cases, to Europe, and an increas ing inclination to live in houses rather than in tents have given mos of the Bakhtiari Khans a veneer of civilization, which, though41 still very superficial, yet makes it possible to conduct business with them with some hope of a mutually satisfactory settlement. They have a fairly acute perception of the political situation in Persia, and of their own relation thereto ; this cannot be said of the Qashqal chiefs, who whilst exhibiting all the superficial intelligence of their race in conversation, have proved unstable in their policy and busi ness relations. They resemble far more closely the tribal chiefs of Luristan, a description of whom will be found in Volume V of this report. Racial Homogexeity. 83. A few T words seem called for on the effect of racial homogeneity upon the organisation of the various congeries of tribes in South- West Persia. It is a mistake to imagine that a common racial origin has any effect upon the political unity of a tribe. The Pusht-i- Kiih tribes are homogeneous to a degree, but it has not prevented the personal quarrels of the W ah and his son from dividing them into two hostile camps. The tribes of Luristan exhibit less diversity of race and tongue than those of any province of South-West Persia, yet nowhere are tri! esmen so hopelessly split up into warring groups. 84. Turk and Arab Gao-Mish tribes, speaking their own langua ges, form an appreciable portion of the tribes under the sway of the Bakhtiari Khans, but the political unity of the Bakhtiari tribes in no way suffers from the fact. Until recently no province w T as more disunited than ’Arabistan, where all alike are Arabs, speak- ing a common tongue, and having much in common, both socially and politically. * 85. The Qashqai have a common tongue and a common origin ; for many years they have been more or less united under the gui dance of a single family; but they have not until the last few years attained political strength, and are easily divided into hostile camps by the dissensions of their chiefs. They are more prosper ous than perhaps any other large nomad tribe ; while their exten sive lands in the high and low country, their large flocks and the narrow limits within which their lines of migration necessarily run make them peculiarly vulnerable. Their country is moun tainous in places, but not to the same extent as the Bakhtiari or Kuhgalu country. It is traversed byseveral roads fit for large bodies of troops, whose supplies could be supplemented from the sedentary popu lation, wdiich will be found all over Fars. 86. The Khamseh are even less homogeneous than the Qashqal. Their chiefs are drawn from no one family, unless the Qawanna C361GSB O42 be considered as the ruling clan. The institution of Ilkhdnl and llbegi is unknown, the sole official recognised by them being the “hahim ” or “ Rais-i-’Arab ” appointed by the Persian Government. As his name implies, he is intended to take charge of and control them. This official has never been selected from the tribal chiefs, and for the past decade has almost always been selected from the Qawam family. 87. Notes upon individual tribes. Boir Ahmadl. Lashani. Chehar-Rahi. Mamassani. Khamseh. Qashqai. For a description of the Kuhgalu tribes, see Gazetteer, Volume II. Boir Ahmadi .—This tribe is the most important of the Chehar Banicheh group of Kuhgalu tribes, which also includes the Churam- Nuyl and Bavi, all of which are considered to belong to the Pusht- i-Kuh division of the Kiihgalu; though settlements of the Boir Ah madi are to be found round Behbehan. Tribal tradition has it that the Boir Ahmadi are descended from one Malik-ut-Tujjar of Isfahan. Until 1907 they were more or less united under Karim Khan, Bahadur-ud-Dauleh, but on his death they reverted to the usual tribal feuds. Their principal chiefs, each with a fairly large following, are Shukrullah Khan and his two small nephews the Aulad-i-Karim Khan, Qaid Muhammad 'Ali and Mulla Kubad. The former was predominant in 1909. They number about 4,500 families and are capable of putting about 600 horsemen and 1,000 footmen into the field. It is for their footmen, however, that they are best known. They are noted foi then mobility, being credited with the power to make marches of 80 miles a day, and, with the Baharlu, are noted for the audacity of their raids. J f They are divided into the following sections or “ task”: Amlajat. Aqai. Aulad Mirza 'Ali, Badluni. Dasht-i-Mauri, Juzaii. Kagawal. Kurrai. Narral. Saiyid Baba Muhammad!. Sarchuti. Sarkuhakl.

Tll ® ir t raiding grounds are near Khan-i-Ziman, wher, L K ' “&gt; - •*43 li They have gained considerable notoriety of recent years for their bold attacks on the Bushire-Isfahan road, and in particular for their carefully planned raid on the Russian Consul-General’s caravan in November 1909, in conjunction, it is said, with Qashqal under Muhammad All Ivhan Qashquli. They have been known to combine with the MamassanI, as well as the Qashqal, to per petrate robberies on a large scale; they have, however, no dose political bonds with either party, nor with the Qawamls, with whom they are sometimes in touch. They spend the winter in Sunkarabad, Qalat, Deh-i-Dasht and Suk-i-Changalwar. They summer in Chanar, Sar Rud and the slopes of Kuh-i- Dina. They remain in the high country or “Sarhadd ” later than any other of the tribes in Ears. The following forts are in their hands:— Azu, occupied by Nasrullah Khan. Chanar, occupied by Qaid Muhammad ’AH. Dil, occupied by Nasrulkh Khan. Fashiun, occupied by A. Saiyid Dal. Kalayar, occupied by Muhammad Khan. Sar Rud, occupied by Shukrullah Khan. Sisakht, occupie# by Mu 11 a Kubad. Tal Khusrii, occupied by Ghulam Husain Khan. Their market towns are Behbehan and Ardakan; they export ghi, gum, almonds, carpets, wool and goats’ hair. The total mdli- ydt demanded from them is 4,000 tumdns, payable at Behbehan, a town in the local politics of which they frequently play a pro minent part. The remaining Chehar Banicheh tribes take no part in Ears affairs, and for^ details concerning them reference is invited to Captain Ranking’s Report. 88 . Chehdr Rdhl .—This tribe, with whom are included the Yishn and Sarchaham, are a group numbering 600 families; they live in tents, spending the winter in Abadeh-i-Tashk, with ’the Lashani (&lt; 7 .v.),the summer in Bavanat, but they have no fixed “ sarhadd. ” The Kaldntar of the Chehar-Rahi is Panj ’All, that of the Yishni Mustafa Quli, that of the Sar Chahanl (200 tents), Mulla Muhsim The last named cultivate lands which are the fief of Haidar ’A1 Khan of the Nawab family of Shiraz. q244 f 89. Khamseh :-Tlie Il-i-Khams (five tribea) is a congcrie made up of the following elements :— ( 1 ) 'Arab. ( 2 ) Baliarlu (Turk). (3 Basiri. ( 4 ) Ainalu (Turk). ( 5 ) Nafar (now dispersed). The ’Arab and Basiri alone are nomadic. Each of these tribes is described in detail below. The titular head of the whole tribe is a “hakim” or “rais-i- ’Arab ’’ appointed by the Persian Government, and subject to the authority of the Governor-General of Ears. Of recent years the appointment has been given to one of the leading members of Jbhe Hashimieh family, now generally known as the QawamTs. The only exceptions have been the appointment on several occasions of Mansur-us-Saltaneh and of Mu’tamid-ud-Divan. The latter was murdered by ’Askar Khan and his brother, on the occasion of his first meeting with the tribal chiefs of the Khamseh, though he had 800 men and two guns at his back. Habitat .—The Arab tribes spend the summer in the highlands of Deh Bid and Bavanat, and to the east; the winter in Darab, Furg, Sab’eh and Laristan. The Baharlu and ’Ainalu are practi cally sedentary in villages in the Darab, Furg, and Sab’eh districts. The southern limit of the ’Arab on the Bandar 'Abbas-Lar road is Birqeh Nau. The Basiri also spend the summer in the highlands ; but migrate to Bidshahr in the winter. Organisation .—Each of the above sub-tribes has its recognised leader or leaders, who determine the policy of the tribe as a whole ; their chiefs were formerly of the AbulvardI clan, which has now lost its ascendancy. The chieftainship of each clan is normally hereditary. Numbers .—They number altogether about 23,000 families, the total being made up as follows :— Families. ’Arab Jabbareh .. .. .. .. ,. jq 000 ’Arab Shaibani .. .. ,. ,, 11 5 qqq Baliarlu .. .. .. .. .. 4,’oOO Basin .. .; .. .. .. .. 3,500 lAm alu 800 Total .. 23,300 Nafar and Badaki dispersed. y v f *i 45 (Vf r Y r Military qualifications.— The Khamseh, united probably for the first time in history, when they came to the assistance of the Qawamis against Saulat-ud-Dauleh, certainly raised quite 3,000 well-armed men, who showed greater spirit and determination than the Qashqai, upon whom they inflicted heavy losses and a severe defeat. Under the most favourable circumstances they might put 4,000 men into the field, but not more. The tribesmen are not fully under the control of their own chiefs, and would seldom fail to be a source of acute anxiety to the commander of any army, to whose as sistance they saw fit to come. The tribes, as a whole, are probably as well aimed as the Qash- qais, but seem to possess a greater variety of rifles, in contrast to the latter, whose rifles ore for the most part Mausers. The tribe has hitherto, however, never been sufficiently united to be able to under take any concerted action, whether against the Persian Government or a rival tribe; and to this fact, in a large measure, must be ascribed the recent increase of Qashqai influence in Pars. .. ( 1 ) ’Arab—(a) Jabbareh, \b) Shaibani.—This tribe originally came from Nejd, ’Oman, and \amam in the VII Century A.t). Some reside near Itamuz, where they are known as the A1 Khamis, but the bulk of the tribe is in Pars, with winter quarters in the buluks of Sab’eh, Budan, and Ahmadi, and summer quarters in Dek Bid, Bavvanat, Qunquri, etc. A corrupt form of Arabic is spoken, but many of the tribes men are acquainted with Persian. The tribe numbers perhaps 15,000 tents, of which the Jabbareh claim 10 , 000 , the Shaibani 5,000. (a) Jabbareh. —The Jabbareh ’Arabs are known as ’Arab-i-Kuchl. From ancient times till 1881 the chiefs of the ’Arabs were of the Shai bani branch, and the Basirl tribe was eften under them also. In the beginning of the XVIII Century their chief was Mir Ismail Khan, whose descendants continued to hold the chieftainship until 1881, when Riza Qull Khan, Sartip, died, and was succeeded by the Qawam-ul-Mulk, and subsequently by Amir Aqa Khan, ’Arab, Mansur-us-Saltaneh, whose descent from Riza Qull Khan is shown in the following table :— f 'Abba? Khan ? Mir Salim Khan (d, 1837), “ Mansur-us-Sal- taneh,” MlrTsma’il Mir Mahdi Mir Salim Khan, Khan, Khan, Aqa Khan . Riza Qull Khan, (d, 1881). Amir Aqa Khan46 r Both Amir Aqa Khan and his brother live at Fakhrabad in Bawanat and are entitled to receive a pension from Government. \ The present heads of the Jabbareh are (1913) Jani Khan, Amir Quli Khan, Bahadur Khan, son of 'All Muhammad Khan, and Sa’ad- ullah Khan; Bahadur Khan’s sister was the wife of the late Nasr- ud-Dauleh (Qawami).

The whole tribe therefore numbers 10,000 tents. For details respecting the Jabbareh see the Gazetteer of Persia, Volume III, page 549. A different list of 28 sections is given by Churchill. (b) Shaibdnl .—The Shaibani are said to number 5,000 tents Their present heads are Riza Quli Khan, ’Askar Khan,* and his brother Muhammad Quli Khan. ^ Askar Khan’ of the Bani ’Abullai controls the ’Alwani, Bani Abdullai, Darazi, Hisani, Labuhaji, Tarbur. Tikritl, and various minor tribes collectively known as the Maqata’jat numbering 3,000 tents. Riza Quli Khan (killed by Nasr-ud-Dauleh, son of Qawam-ul- Mulk, in 1912) controlled the Qutti, and ’Amaleh-i-’Arab tribes of 2,000 tents. The former includes the following sub-divisions i - ’Abdul Yusufi, Aulad Saiyid, Farsi and Vali Shahi. One of the headmen of the ’Amaleh-i-’Arab is Khalar Khan. Churchill gives a different list comprising 23 sections, liie bhaibani live alongside the Jabbareh, whom they generally resemble. It is scarcely necessary to add * Executed in 1913,47 that both Jabbareh and Shaibani are greatly addicted to brigandage, from which they must have earned large profits during the past four years. ( 2 ) Baharlu .—This is a Turk tribe living permanently in the Darab district, their chief, Amir Aqa Khan, residing either at Darab or Khusu, and generally being 5 ex-officio Governor of Darab. They speak the Turk dialect and number from 800 to 1,000 families. They are perhaps the least civilised of the tribes of Fars, and live largely by brigandage ; they have the reputation, with the Boir Ahmadi, of being the most enterprising raiders among the tribes of the province, being noted for their sowars rather than for footmen. Each family supplies at least one mounted man. Their raids are pushed as far as the Bandar ’Abbas-Kirman road, which has several times been raided recently by parties under Kuzan Khan (1912). (3) Tkmn —The Basin are estimated at 3,000 tents. They are a tribe of uncertain origin and not on very good terms with the 'Arab, though they often join with them in raids right up to the gates of Shiraz in winter. They spend the cold weather in Marvdasht, Kurbal* Ardakan and Kam Firuz: the summer in Deh Bid and* Bawanat. The Sarvgarl section of the c’an, which was looted in 1911 by ’Arabs, lives in tents permanently between Fasa and Sarvistan in the Jangal-i-Mamui plain. The principal sections of the tribe are :— (а) ’All Mirzal, including— Hasan Ahmadi. Aulad Hasan Salih. Aulad FasI Salih. Aulad Vail Salih. 'AH Qanbarl. Quql. Karaml. ( б ) Waial, including— Hannah Labumusa. 'AH Shah Qull. Sarvgarl (Kadlchudd HajI Muhammad Khan).48 Their headmen are Parviz Khan, Ayaz Khan and Afrhslab Khan. Many families have joined the Qashqai from this tribe of recent years. (5) ’Ainalii —This is also a Turk tribe; its members live in tents in Kara Bulagb, south of Fasa, but are not really nomadic. The revenue demand from them * three thousand to four thousand tumans a year. Ihey number about 4,000 tents. N a f ar The Nafar with whom are associated the Badaki are now dispersed, and can no longer be counted as an independent tribe. Many of them have joined the Qash qai, the rest live in Marvdasht, and are cultivators and small carriers. 00 Lashanl .—A tribe living in the neighbourhood of Abadeh-i- Tashk * along the northern shore of Lake Nlriz. They number about 300 families (1911). During the summer months they ine in tents, but remain near their houses which they mhabit in winter. Their chief villages are Abadeh-i-Tashk, and Kushkak (latitude 29 43' longitude 53° 50'). The latter village has 70 families of Lashams. They are notorious brigands and their depredations extend to Mur- g hab Yazd and Kirman as well as to the Bushire-Shiraz road. 1 hey are tenants of Mushir-ud-Dauleh. Their Tcalmtars are Nasrullah Khan and Akbar Khan both living at Abadeh-i-Tashk. 91. Mamassani. This tribe, whose name is a corruption of Mu hammad Husain!, inhabits a district sometimes called Shfilistan (though not so in the Fdrsndmeh), bounded on the north by the Ardakan range and the Qashqai country, on the south by the Kaza- run district, on the east by Shiraz, on the west by the Kuhgalu coun try inhabited by Boir Ahmadi, Dushmanziari, etc. They number about 3,000 tents. They are Lurs, resembling generally their Kuh- galu neighbours, whose predatory instincts they share to the full. They are nominally under the Governor-General of Pars at Shiraz, but do not pay tribute to him direct, the major part of the tribal lands having been sold in fief in 1902 to the Mu’m-ut-Tujjar_ of Bushire, who now shares it with the heirs of the late Saiyid Isma/il and Saiyid Muhammad Hasan Shabankareh. The Mu’in’s agent in Shiraz is Haji Mirza Ahmad Khan Lari. 3 The ancient stronghold of the Mamassani is Kaleh Safid not far from Basht, which was captured both by Alexander and Timur and about 1840, 1 believe, by Shiel, an English officer in the Persian service.49 The Mamassrni live in the plains of Basht and Fahlian in winter, and in summer move their tents to the slopes of the moun tains above the valleys. Further details of the district will be found in Chapter VIII under “ Shulistan.” They claim to be descended from Rustam, and to have emigrated from Sistan. One division^ the Mahmud Salihi, broke away in 1885 and joined the Qashqais and were followed later by the Fahlian, the remain ing tribes are indicated in the following table — Name. Habitat.

Tamnradi •• 500 Isma'il Khan. Javidi •• •• •• 91 The Qashqai tribes. Origin .—There is a tradition that, when the Turkoman tribes, during the Mongol invasions, reached the province of Persian’Iraq, a C361GSB a50 band of them fled and settled in Pars, and that the Turkomans called this band Qachqai, i.e., ‘ those who ran away (from Qachmak - to flee'. Changes in pronunciation afterwards converted tins appella- tion into ‘ £ Qashqai.” Another tradition has it that Hulagu Khan brought them from Kashgar. The language of the Qashqai has remained Turk! to this day and the inhabitants of Ears usually speak of them as Turk. In course of time the original band became divided into two parts, because a large section retained the nomadic habit of niigia- tion, spring and autumn. The one part kept the Turkoman ap pellation of ‘ Khalach,’ the other was called Qashqai, each having several branches, all known now-a-days as Qashqai. Of all the “ tirehs ” or clans of to-day the Shishbuluki and Farsimaidan are of the very few stated to be “ Khalach in origin. 92 Habitat .—No nomad tribes in Persia travel so far in their mi grations as do the Qashqai, whose winter quarters extend to the im mediate neighbourhood of Riz, Jam, and Galehdar in the south; their summer quarters being in the neighbourhood of Asupas, Ar- sinjan, Ardakan and the Chehar and Shish Dangeh districts paral lel with, but west of Yazd-i-khast, where they come into contact with the ’Arab tribes. Their most northerly southern camping grounds are in the last two-named districts. To the west they ex tend to within a few miles of Behbehan, this district being visited by the Darashiin section, whilst the Kas'ikuli come down to within a few miles of the sea on the borders of the Dashtis' an district. They will not be found east of Afzar or the Qir-o-Karzin plain nor in the Kara Aghach valley from Kavar to Taduan. 93 The province of Fars is administratively divided into a num ber of Governorships (Huki.mats), Sub-governorships (Naib-ul- Hukiimeh) and Districts (Biduk), of which the last-named are very ill- defined. A large number of these Bui9k, and a few Governorships are in the possessio i of the Qashqai tribe and whatever settled popu lation there may be in the towns or villages of those districts is under the control, and entirely at the mercy, of the Qashqai II ” and its chiefs. During the past few years, under Saulat-ud-I)auleh parti cularly, there has been a considerable extension of power of the llkhdni and tribes in this direction. 94 In the Garmsir ot Southern Fars, the Qashqai possess the governmental district 5 of Firuzdbdd ; for the past two years the gov ernment of Kazarun has either been in the hands of an underling of the Ilkhlni, or, as lately, with the Kalantars of the Kashkuli section, Muhammad ’Ali Khan'Kashkuli and others.A very large portion of Fars is therefore in the hands of, or con nected with, the Qashqals, and the settled population of those dis tricts and the men left in charge of land under cultivation by the tribe form a large addition to the numbers of the actual tribesmen. In many cases the settled villagers detest the tribes men for plunder of the village flocks, oppression, destruction of their crops and highway robbery—the cry “ ghale burde and ” (they have carried off the flocks) is frequently heard from shepherds hastening back to their villages—but the “ Turks V have the whip- hand over all. 95 Number of the Qdshqdls .—It is impossible to obtain precise in formation as to the num 3 rical strength of the “ II.’’ In 1890 Lord Curzon quoted as follows from a communication derived from the tribe :— “All Qashqal tribes are now under Darab Khan, the Ilbegl. Twenty years ago, there were over 60,000 families of these tribes, all under Muhammad Quli Khan {i.e., about 1860- 1866). At that time they were able to bring into the field 120,000 horse, but after his death the tribal aflairs fell into the hands of smaller Khans, which resulted in in ternal dissensions. Owing to this about 5,000 families went over to the Bakhtiarls, 5,000 families to the Kham- seh II, and 4,000 families dispersed. This reduced the total to 46,000 families.” The great famine of 1871 to 1872 wrought havoe among the II ; they were much thinned, and large numbers dispersed. Forty years have passed since then, during which the II has admittedly gained greatly in power, prosperity, property and flocks, while the rapid multiplication in numbers customary in eastern tribes must also be taken into account; it may therefore be assumed that the numbers of the II have now nearly regained what they had lost in 1870. If we reckon 5 persons to each family or tent, this makes a total of 300,000 tribespeople. The present Ilbegl in conversation esti mated that the II numbered at least 500,000. In any estimate it is, however, extremely difficult to separate the nomad families from the sedentary peasants and cultivators of those districts, in which the Qashqal have properties, or encamp, or from the deserters and refu gees from other tribes of Fars, for the purpose of impressing others with their strength, the Qashqai chiefs probably include all these and their tenants as Qashqal. The figures given above would lead one to believe that the actual numbers of the nomad units are about 40,000 tents, or families ; theirmoteqes (Bulwardi, etc.), allies, tenantry and cultivators o{ their lands may conceivably—but by no means certainly—make an ad- ditional 10,000 families, some of whom were once Qashqai nomads, but are now sedentary, and inhabit various districts, main \ or wholly under Qashqai control. Perhaps 5,000 of these may be reckon ed as available to the llkhani, as a source from which to draw fighting men. The remainder could in no circumstances be so utiliz ed. The Surkhis, who live in the Qashqai villages south of Shiraz, and the Kuhmarrehs in the Siakh and Jirreh districts, who are typic al sedentary Turks, are in no way inferior in fighting qualities to the nomad. Among the Qashqai, for every two tents three men capable of bearing arms might be reckoned. There is thus no basis on which to form an accurate census; the Saulat-ud-Dauleh, when llkhdni, stated that nobody knew the exact number, and he did not want to find out, as the ^e^ enue (w.ttl'iytti) exacted from the llkhclni was in the form of a poll-tax, and it w as not in his interest to ascertain and supply the exact numbers. 96 Fighting men.—There should be, in theory, about 60,000 fight ing men at the Ilkhdnis disposal and there are as a matter of fact probably not less than 15,000 modern rifles in possession of his tribes, and half as many obsolete ones. But no llkhdni has ever been able to collect and keep together more than 3.000 men at most. Saulat- ud-Dauleh, acting with the approval, and at the request, of the Governor-General, was unable to keep more than 2,000 men in the field in support of the Nizam, in spite of the attractive prospect of the loot of Shiraz, that he dangled before his men. The season was more over convenient, and supplies from pillaged villages abundant. The maximum number of men that an influential llkhdni could hope to collect and keep together at a favourable moment, such as, for instance, the month immediately preceding the migration to or from the plains, is 4,000 men. Such a force could only be retained for a few weeks, and only when plentiful supplies were available local- ly ' ♦ 97 The Qashqai are probably superior to the Bakhtlarl as fighting men. The mere fact that their losses in Shiraz during the autumn of 1911 amounted to over 400 killed and a proportionate number wounded, proves that they are not deficient in courage of a sort; but their failure to make an impression on the defences of the part of the town which they were attacking, indicates that they are deficient in other qualities essential to a fighting man. It was noticeable that almost all Qashqai losses were incurred duringnight attacks and the fact that both sides had recourse to mining and countermining is worthy of record. 98 Arms. —The Qashqal are well armed, practically every able- bodied man being in possession of a magazine or Martini rifle, and were, in 1912, fairly well supplied with ammunition. Saulat-ud- Dauleh was permitted by the Persian Government to import some 200,000 rounds, early in 1911, for the use of his tribesmen, in protect ing the roads. Though most of this was expended during the autumn of 1911 at Shiraz, the deficiency has probably since been made good. 99 Organisation. —The ruler and supreme chief of the whole ‘ //' or collective tribes of the QashqaT, has in the past been appointed as such by the Central and Provincial Government and not by the common consent of the tribesmen, but at the present day there is little doubt that no appointment could be made effectual, unless it was supported by the principal sections of the ll, and their leaders. He has been known since 1816 as the Ilkham, and with him rests the responsibility for the policy of the Qashqals and their relations with the Central Government or other organizations, but, as often as not, he deputes one of his relatives to act for him in the col lection of revenue, and the management of all internal affairs of the //, this person being known as the llbegi. It sometimes happens that the Ilkhdni, by force of circumstances, has to retire into the back ground, and then the real executive power lies with the llbegi. The IlJchdm and llbegi must come of the descent of the Khans of the Shahllu (Shamlu) clan. For every ‘ tireh ' of the 11 there is a Kaldntar, to whom that clan owes obedience : these Jcaldntars are themselves subject to none save the Ilkhdni and llbegi (and are frequently in revolt against them). The appointment of the Koldntars, their dismissal and reinstatement is at the will of the Ilkhdni and llbegi : but, in the case of the largest clans, the Kaldntars are often so powerful as to be able to defy the Ilkhdni and to remain aloof in a sort of sullen hostility. The Kaldntars of most clans have, however, rivals among their own near relatives. 100 Revenue Assessment of the ‘ ll. ’—The /Hs assessed in the ori ginal mdliydt at 27,000 tumdns ; 30,000 tumnds farh ’) were added by Farhad Mirza. The sums actually exacted from the Kaldntars of the clans by the Ilkhdni and llbegi as revenue are of course much greater. The ‘Amaleh ’ are exempted from mdliydt in return for their feudal service at all times.54 Thfi revenue demanded from the Qashcjai is pioportionately higher than that asked, for instance, from the Bakhtiari, who only pay T.70,000 as against T.57,000 due from the Qashqai, the latter sum has been paid fairly regularly until recently {i.e. 1907). The total amount now owing to the Persian Government by Saulat-ud Dauleh, on account of revenue, is not far short of Tumdns 250,000. 101 Manners atul Customs.—The Qashqais are nomadic, not only by traditional custom but also because their tribal wealth and food supply depends so largely on their flocks and herds that the necessity of leaving the ‘hot regions’ before the gracing in the valleys has been dried up by the hot spring sun of Southern Pars, and of seeking fresh pastures on the high plateaus of Northern Pars, is imperative, while the climate of the Sarhadd is too bitter during the winter months, and far more fire wood can be obtained in the hills of'the Garin nr. Their sheep and goats not only provide milk, meat and clarified fat, which are staple items of their food, but the wool an 1 hair is used by the tribes for weaving their own tents end coverings, and carpets for sale in the towns, from which source each tent derives a portion of its yearly income. The Qashqai sell few lambskins (and therefore kill few lambs) in comparison with the ’Arab tribes : and in some Wrehs ’ the poorest tribesmen are said to own 300 animals. Sheep too find a large sale among the settled inhabitants of the south during the winter season. Those sections of the tribes, which possess a large number of horses and animals sow each winter in the valleys of the ‘ Garmsir,’ which they are in the habit of visiting each autumn, and the harvest ed grain will be ready for their consumption on their return in the autumn. Thus the wide valley of Farrashband is almost entirely cultivated by the. Shishbuluki ‘ are/*,’ and some 200—300 tons of grain are probably raised there every spring. Of late years also the chiefs of the Qashqai, and, in imitation of them, some of the Khans of the ‘ ilrehs ’ have acquired, seized or bought large properties in the Qashqai districts or ‘Buluk ’ of the south. This factor in the life of the tribe has great influence on their regular migrations backwards and forwards ; some of these properties, for instance, raise large quantities of rice, a staple article of food. They are now one of the richest of the nomad tribes of Persia and the best armed, their proximity to the sea coast in winter enabl ing them to make large purchases of rifles and ammunition on favourable terms. They have seldom come into direct conflict with the Per sian Government, as their proximity to Shiraz and Isfahan, their55 large flocks, extensive landed property, and lengthy migrations have always made them peculiarly vulnerable. The Qashqal—in their winter quarters at any rate—do not camp in the open valleys ; one does not see a hundred or more tents pitched in one place, and indeed one might travel many miles through the heart of the Qashqal country without noticing an encampment. Their custom is to select secluded valleys and ravines on the hill side, which are to an extent protected from the winter weather and also near water, and in such spots four, ten, or twenty tents may be seen together. The enormous extent of country occupied by the Qash- qals and their distribution in sparse units, widely scattered over extremely mountainous country, not only prevent the tribes from accumulating in any one place in more than a small fraction of their real strength, but elso would seem to make any operations against the tribe or certain sections of it a difficult matter. Moreover, in many cases the ‘ tirch ’ in its winter quarters is divided and settled in distinct portions, far apart from one another. Thus the main body of the Kashkuh's are settled in the Milatun hills, from Khist to Mishun, but another branch of the Kashkfilis still pro ceeds each year to the ‘Buluk ’ of Qlr and Karzln. There are Galleh Zan Namadi between Farrashband and Jirreh : there is another part of this clan in Hangam and Qir, Ja’afarbegl are on the eastern border of the ‘Bulu'c’ of Dashti near Shonbeh, and also with the Ilkhdnl in Qir and Karzin. They resemble generally the Lur nomads of south-west Persia, but many minor points of difference present themselves, in addition to those referred to at the commencement of this chapter. Their language is a dialect of Turki, though most tribesmen understand Persian fairly well. In appearance they compare favourably with their Lur compatriots: they seem on the whole to be taller and fairer than Bakhtiaris, and certainly more so than Lurs. In religion they seem more orthodox, and less superstitious than their Lur neighbours. ’All Illahis will not be found among them, and Imdmzadehs Qadamgahs and Plrs are as noticeable by their rarity in Pars as by their frequency in the Luristan and the Bakhtiari country. 102 Migrations .—The migrations of the Qashqai differ little from those of other nomad tribes ; mules are more used for transport pur poses than is the case elsewhere, and cattle are not extensively em ployed ; they are probably the only tribe in South Persia, except the Arabs, who use camels for the purpose.56 The migration takes place twice a year, once up-country and once down, and varies to the extent of very few days. About the vernal ecjumox, or Nauroz, they commence to strike then black tents and move slowly north; they leave their northern pastures rather before the middle of September, and come back to their old camping grounds in the south. Lheir summer-cjuaiters, known as &lt;s Sarhadd !&gt; are near the northern boundary of Fars, west of Qumisheh and Yazd-i-khast, and reach to the eastern slope of the Kuh-i-Danna (the Kuhgalu tribes being on the south-west of this range) ; their winter-quarters are in the Garmslr or hot regions of Fars, ranging from the vicinity of Behbehan to near Lar, but never south of the range of mountains bordering the coast-line, that is to say, generally, more than 40 miles inland as the crow flies. The lines of movement of each tribe, as far as is known, are men tioned in the notes on each section at the end of this Chapter. The principal route is that adopted by the Uarashuri, Kashkuli and others, who, coming from Behebehan and the Mahur-i-Mailatun dis trict respectively, strike the Bushire-Shiraz post road in the neigh bourhood of Kazarun and follow the general trend of this route as far as Dasht-i-Arjan and Khan-i-Zinlan, whence they either proceed via Chehar-i-Bahdar, and cross the Shiraz plain to Guyum and Baiza, or more direct to Ardakiin. From the latter point they disperse by various routes to their summer quarters. A few tribes use the Tang-i-Allahu Akbar, north of Shiraz, but the majority prefer to keep well to the west of the town. Tribes coming from Galehdar ’AlaMarvdasht, Afzar, etc., generally pass through Chehar-i-Rahdar on their way up-country. The migration of the llkhani, of the large force attached to his person and of a number of smaller branches, lies between Chah Kazimeh, Laghar and Makfi and the neighbourhood of the Gulf port Tahiri and, in the north, Sima ran beyond Asupas. Generally speaking, the downward migration of the whole ll converges on Baiza andGuyunto the north of Shiraz and then divides, the Darashuri, Kashkuli, Farsimaidan going off towards Shahpur or Dashtarjan, while the Shishbuluki and many smaller tribes, theand his adherents, strike south via Jirreh, Farrashband, Khwaja and Fiiuzabad. It is rarely that the ‘ tirehs ’ change the course of their migration and, any deviation from the customary lines being difficult for the larger tribes, to block their upward path is not only the easiest, but the most effective way of putting pressure upon any particular tribe, or on the tribe as a whole.12 59 been merged into larger branches: in times of stress large bodies of the Qashqai have gone over to the Bakhtiari country, or, in a less degree, to the Khamseh tribes, and become identified with those lls. Severity on the part of the Ilkhdnls or partisan jealousies in the ‘tireh’ itself are often—even now-a-days—the cause of secessions. On the other hand, many of the ‘tirehs ’ are to-day composed of elements in which little of the original Qashqai stock can be traced, and much new blood has been imported. Thus the present leading family of the Kashkull clan came from the Zend tribe, originating from near Kirmanshah. The Fars tribe called BulwardI, “Arab” tribes like Nafar and Kuhgalu Lurs are to be found scattered amongst and incorporated in the Qashqai. Peasantry from a certain district will attach themselves to the clan frequenting the district, and small sedentary tribes like the Turkseliu, Gunakr and Maslari, near Maimand, have been taken under the patronage of the Qashqai and will no doubt in time become completely absorbed. Writing of the exo dus of the Qashqals from Fars into the Kirman province, in 1829, the Farsnameh says:— “Murtaza Qull Khan llbecjl had taken the Qashqai nomads towards Kirman, and 'AH Akbar Khan Nafr, with the Nafar ll and^the Baharlu, and Ma’sum Khan ’Ainalu, with the'Ainalu//, had joined the “ llbegi.” At the present time a part of the Basirl and Nafar (two original sections of the Khamseh tribes) are living among the Qashqai.' The original 44 ‘lirehs’ have therefore increased, but it is diffi cult to get an accurate list of all. A list of 57 clans is given by the Farsnameh (History of Fars) written over 30 years ago. In January 1911, Saulat-ud-Dauleh, Ilkhdnl, gave Mr. Chick out of hand a list of 47 nomad or partly nomad clans, though he added that he could not, on the spur of the moment, remember all the smallest ‘tirehs.’ The lists compiled in 1875 under Colonel Ross, and mentioned in 1890 by Lord Curzon in his book, give comparatively few names, and there is much diversity of spelling. 108. The first 13 ‘ tlrehs ’ in the list given below are mentioned in all the four previous lists, and include the most important: the first 40 “tucks” were included by. both the Farsnameh and Sauh t-ud- Dauleh, or else have come under the personal observation of consular officials lately. N. B .—Names of habitat and migration given are localities, in some cases districts. If names of villages are given the neighbouring country is meant.

NOTES ON SEVERAL OF TEE CLANS AND THEIR kalantars. 112. I. Darashurl {Dar Shull). 113. The camp of Ayyaz Kiha Khan has usually been near Ab- daran and Bib! Hakimeh : that of ’Ali Panah Kiha Khan (when he is on good terms with Ayyaz Kiha) at Sar Abnaiz, 8 farsakhs from Khairabad near Behbehan. b or a short time Saulat-ud-Dauleh made ’All Panah Kiha Khan halantar ot the Darashuris, and deposed Ayyaz Kiha Khan, butin 1^11 Ayyaz Kiha Khan threw in his lot with Saulat-ud-Dauleh, took the bulk of his large clan to the Saulat’s winter quarters in Qir and Karzin, and in the spring of 1912 fought for the ex-Ilkhanl against Zaigham and other clans. ♦ 113. In dealing with the Qashqais or following the squence of events in tribal politics, it is most important to have a knowledge of their relationships, which are often connected with rivalries. The following are Khans of the tireh, and their descent Haji ’All Panah Kiha. Haji Baba Ayyaz Kiha Khan. Agl.a Kiha. ’All Panah Kiha Khan. II. — Kashkull. Vail Khar Kiha. 114. This ‘ tireh’, in numbers third in importance in the 11, is in influence at present the second or even first. The Khans of the Kashkuli estimate the number of tents at about 5,000, and the num ber of armed tribesmen at 2,000 to 3,000. They are extensive agricul turists both in their summer and winter quarters. The forniei arc m the Kuh-i-Mihr and Kakan : the latter all round the Mailatun lulls. The Kashkulis were originally a “Ears” tribe pure and simple, i.e., their winter haunts were in what they call bars, between Jahrum and Lar ; their rise in importance am mg the Qashqa.s dates from early in the nineteenth century. Some families of the Zend tribe (to which Karim Khan belonged) migrated or fled from the Kirmanshah district and settled with the Qsshqal 11.^ One of these families soon attained to leadership among the Kashkulis, and formed matrimonial alliances with Jam Khan, the llkhanl, and his family. The most noted of these Zend or Kashkuli Khans was Qasim Khan, who died in the year of the British war. He was res ponsible for the branch findinganew habitat in the mountains, from Shahpur to Haic.t Daud, for the Kashkulis and Qashqais had not spread to that side before. The descendants of his brother Haji ’Abbas ’Ali are still settled in the direction of Gallehdar and Qir and Karzin, and the tribe is apparently known not as Kashkuli but as (Afshar) Kirmanl. All Kashkulis meet round the Kuh-Mihr (Qumair ?) in the summer. Qasim Khan and his brothers had a numerous progeny, so that the Khans say that of their grandfathers’ descendants they can muster 100 riflemen.TO The late Ilyas Khan was famed throughoat southern Persia for his extraordinary strength. Saulat-ud-Dauleh is not only the son of a Kashkull mother, but he is married to a daughter of Haji ’Abdull; h Khan, nephew of Qaslm Khan ; his wife’s sister is married to Haidar ’AH Khan Kashkull, brother of Muhammad ’AH Khan. 115. Like the llbegl, Saulat-us-S .Itaneh, some of the younger Kashkuli Khans have begun to take lessons in English. The Khans of greatest note at present are (i) Muhammad ’All Khan, who is married to the sister of Muhammad Beg. He is a man of very fine presence and physique, and noted among the Qashqais for his warlike qualities and bravery in fight. He is a leader in war, and has a large followingvd^uthe is headstrong, and does not strike one as being veryifltrUigpjit. He is addicted to opium. His winter quarters are at BablT^fc*^ (Mishun). In October 1911 he was appointed joint Governor of Kazarun and Shahpur by ’Ala-ud-Dauleh, and contrary to custom stayed near Shahpur. His tents are near the Kaleh Hakim Basin above the Shah pur river. (u) Muhammad Beg, Sitwat-Nizam (now called Hujabr’A- sha’ir), son of the late Muhammad Hasan Beg, is said to be as brave as Muhammad ’AH Khan and much more politic and skilful in management of affairs. Half the clan follows him. He has intercourse with Zaigham and Qawam-ul-Mulk. Both he and his father were deter mined enemies of Saulat-ud-Dauleh and up to 1911 he had generally been on hostile terms with his own cousins. His winter quarters are behind AigunI and the Mulla Anar pass at the extremity of the Mailatun hills. He is an opium-smoker. (in) Haji Muhammad Karim Khan, who was sent to represent the Qcishqais in the Tehran Majlis, is described as very acute and the “ wisest head ” of all the Khans. He used to be very partial to Saulat-ud-Dauleh’s cause, • ' and is now consulted by Saulat-us-Saltaneh and the Kas-hkulis as regards their policy. He has property at Moinak (near Farrashband). (iv) His brother ’Abdul Hasan Khan is a grey-haired man and an opium-smoker, but a first class horseman and a very71 friendly personality, of weight in tribal matters. His winter quarters are at Mishun. (v) Haidar ’AH Khan, brother of Muhammad ’AH, speaks with moderation and sensibly. His winter quarters are at Baba Kelu, 3 farsakhs from Mishun. Owing to his wife and the wife of Saulat-ud-Dauleh being sisters he is very friendly disposed towards the Sardar. (vi) Ghulam Husain Khan is about 30 years of age. Owing to the character and warlike qualities of Muhammad ’AH Khan and Muhammad Beg, the Kashkulls have acquired great importance ; up to recently there was enmity between these two sections, but they have now joined to oppose Saulat-ud-Dauleh. —--O qiisid erable pressure has been brought on M uhamni ad- ’Ali Khan for a reconciliation with SaulaMKl-Xh nil i )i (fil'iTugFSaulat-us-Sul- Attached:is^EKegouealogy of the Khans. 110 III. — Shishbuluki. Ahmad Khan has been principal Kaldntar of this ‘ tireh ’ for man y y e ars ; thougli under Saulat-ud-Dauleh he was for a time re placed by Shir Khan Beg and Baqir Beg, cousins of Ahmad Khan. The tents of Ahmad Khan are pitched at Khurma-yek on an alter native (and easier) route from Farrashband to Bushakun. The elder of Ahmad Khan's daughters is the widow of Zargham-ud- Dauleh, late Ilkhdni: a younger daughter is the wife of Zaigham- ud-Dauleh, half-brother of the last-named and of Saulat-ud-Dauleh. His sons are— Husain Quli Khan (about 24). Amir Khan (17). Saftar Khan (15). The tribe live round the Farrashband and Bushakun plains and may be found near Tahlak, in the Tang-i-Sehdar, and on the slopes of the Kuh-i-BairamI (near Kamarii), while they extend towards the Dasht-i-Palang.

ZakI Khan and Masih Khan were up in arms against Saulat- ud-Dauleh in 1910 and for a time he nominated a cousin, Zulfikar Khan, Kaldntar of the tribe. Hostilities broke out and Zulfikar Khan was badly wounded. 118 . VI. — Safikhani. The Kalantarship is at present held by Khan Mirza Beg, who lives at Dehrud with his brother Fathullah Beg. Their uncle, Sar- masht Beg, an old man, and his son Nasrullah have however held the Kalantarship previously. This ‘ tireh ’ is famous for its bravery, despite its small numbers. Khan Mirza Beg told me that they were 400—500 families. 119. VII — Ja’afarbegi. Javad Khan, a spare greyla^tTr-^a^out 50, is the Kaldntar.

Before entering on a discussion regarding the amount of supplies likely to be available for a military force moving or sta tioned in the country, it is necessary to define the conditions under which we assume such a force to enter the country. If with the consent, or at all events without the active opposition, of the Persian Government, it is safe to assume that we shall eventually be able to obtain the co-operation of tribal and other authorities. If on the other hand we are acting without the consent of the Persian Gov ernment, or in direct opposition to local authorities, we can no longer count upon the complaisance of the latter, and a new set of conditions arises : this possibility must be taken into considera tion. 122. Su'p'plies for troops moving on the Bushire-Shirdz-Isfahdn road with consent of local authorities .—In order to meet the demand for fodder and provisions which is created by the passage of large mercantile caravans up and down the main roads, the stocks of fodder available at various stages are generally considerably in excess of the quantities actually grown by the village concerned, as fodder is brought in for miles round for sale to persons in the village who make a business of supplying caravans. It thus happens that with a few exceptions, noted in the route, large stocks of straw and barley are available at every stage from Bushire to Isfahan and more could be brought in at short notice. Straw and barley are not, as a rule, stocked in large barns, but in pits and small rooms, scattered over the village, and one of the principal difficulties in supplying troops is the collection of fodder from the various caches : it all has to be weighed before it can be taken over, and this wastes much time ; 25,000 lbs. of straw and other things pro rata may be taken as the limit which it is generally possible for a single agency to remove from store, weigh, and issue, at the end of a day’s march before nightfall, unless by any chance it is possible to obtain all requirements from one storehouse ; even then the time taken in filling sacks, and removing them through narrow entrances, militates against handling much more than the above quantity. This fact, combined with the difficulty of moving large numbers of baggage animals simultaneously over the narrow track, which constitutes the main road from Bushire to Isfahan, makes C361GSB 75 ,76 it undesirable to have a larger body than one regiment of cavalry or infantry at any one stage on the road, except at Buiazjan, Kazarun, Shiraz, Abadeh and Qumisheh, where supplies are sufficiently plen tiful to enable 2 regiments to camp simultaneously without serious difficulty. At one stage, Mian Kutal, the camping ground is so limited that only 2 squadrons of cavalry and half a, regiment of infantry with transport could find room to camp ; the infantry could however manage somehow or other, no doubt, in the woods round. The stage can be avoided by camping at Ab-Gineh, and proceeding thence ffirect to Dashtarjan, or by moving from Kazarun to Kalunl, and thence by the main road, or by the short cut known as Rah-i-Kal to Dasht. rjan (route No. 53 alt. a). The latter could be used by infantry with transport, though the main road is less difficult for loaded mules. 123. Supplies for troops stationed at various points in Fdrs, consent of local authorities being assumed .— Behbehdn.—A regiment could be supplied without difficulty always, and a large force could live on the country in ordinary years. Burazjdn.- —Ditto. Kdzarun .—This town is an important centre for muleteers, and large stocks of fodder are usually available. Two regiments could be garrisoned here and live on the country. JdhrZm .—This town is well supplied with straw and barley from unirrigated lands ; both are cheap in normal years. Two regiments could live on the country in ordinary years here. Fasd .—At times it is very difficult to obtain fodder at all, especially after passage of Khamseh. There is also extensive irrigat ed cultivation ; it is the centre of the Khamseh tribes’ country, and has some importance from a military point of view in consequence. Two regiments could live on the country in ordinary years. Abddeh Iqlid .—The market town for a large district : not much difficulty should be experienced in keeping one regiment here, but for the winter supplies would have to be laid hi before December. Firuzdbdd. —The market town for a large district: not much difficulty should be experienced in keeping one regiment here; no difficulty in winter. In fact, one regiment of cavalry or infantry could live on the country almost anywhere, as supplies would be always obtainable from villages in the neighbourhood. Iqlid, Mahin, Bawanat, Ardakan, Baiza, Marvdasht, Arsinjan, Sarvistan, Istekbanat, Darab, ’Alamarvdasht, Khfirmuj, and anywhere in77 BashtI, Dashtistan, and the other coastal districts as far as Beh- behan would be favourable centres. 124. Supplies for troops on the march without the consent of the Persian authorities. —In these circumstances it is conceivable, though extremely uni kely, that the Persians might lay waste the country, burning all stores of straw, barley, etc., along the road ; this would not be a very difficult task and would create serious difficulties except in the spring, when grazing is excellent all over Pars and the necessity for grain and straw less urgent. For these reasons the spring is preferable for military operations. If opposition is en countered from villages at which it is desired to purchase supplies, only mountain-guns could effectively break down their resistance and force them to give up their supplies, which are, as has already been pointed out, generally scattered in small store-houses all over the village ; it is improbable however that villagers would offer more than passive resistance to an invading army. 125. Supplies for troops statio?ied at Shiraz without the consent of the Persian author ities. —The possibility of a general boycott must always be reckoned with, even if the Persian Government do not actively object to the presence of the force at Shiraz : it is therefore undesirable to send a force to Shiraz, which is not in a position, if necessary, to compel the sale of food-stuffs which it requires. But it must be realised that the force, whether in Shiraz with the consent of the Persian authorities or not, must be dependent mainly on supplies of fodder, etc., brought in from outlying districts, either directly by its own transport, or through native agency ; if distur bances prevail outside the town, or if the tribes are taking active measures to make a boycott effective, villagers will be prevented from bringing in supplies, and prices will rise rapidly, obliging*the com mander of the force to make his own arrangements to bring in fodder and food-stuffs, possibly by force, from outside. For this purpose the best districts would generally be the fol lowing :— ( 1 ) Kavar, mostly owned by Qawarms : very fertile, not subject as a rule to raids by Arabs or Qashqal. ( 2 ) Khafr, south of Kavar, mostly owned by Qawamis : very fertile, not subject as a rule to raids by Arabs or Qashqal. (3) Sarvistan : fertile, 30 miles S. E. of Shiraz, population adherents of Qawamis. (4) Kurbal, Marvdasht, Briza and Ardakan: all very fertile, but have suffered heavily of recent years from depreda tions of nomads. l278 Firewood is plentiful near Kavar, and at Khand-Zuiian and Dash tar jan. 126. Factors affecting size of force that could live at Shiraz on the country .—It has been shown in Chapter I that the population of Shiraz and of the agricultural, as distinct from the nomadic, dis tricts round it approximates to 140,000 with a density of 40 per square mile. Of these about 100,000 or 20,000 families are agricul turists. Taking an average from the statistics of some 50 villages north of Shiraz obtained in 1907 by an official of the Indo-European Telegraph Department (and checked with satisfactory results by the writer in 1911) it seems that the average crop of wdieat and barley per house in a village is about 1,200 mans Shirazi, or 9.000 lbs.; if half be available for sale to the outside public, the produce destined for the market would be about 2 tons per house, or 40,000 tons for Shiraz and 50 miles round.* Of this quantity half should be available for the use of an occupying force in a normal year, though of course prices w r ould go up rapidly if so large a quantity were needed. In a bad year, 10,000 tons should be available. Assuming the require ments of a cavalry brigade with transport to be about 20 tons a day of wheat and barley, I deduce that a force of this size is about the maximum, which, it can be safely assumed, could live on the country as far as grain is concerned ; a rather larger number of infantrymen could be supplied, but it might be necessary occasionally to feed them on barley flour. Straw .—Turning to the question of straw, I am unable to say wdiat proportion of straw is produced to a given quantity of grain, nor can I give even an estimate of the proportions of wdieat and barley grown, and it is the straw of wheat that is required as bhusa. \Vere the force to come up in early spring, grazing could be exten sively resorted to, etc., and large quantities of grass laid m ; st^raw is awkward to 'carry long distances, and difficult to store. The Commander of a force at Shiraz would have to send out mules under escort to districts two marches distance from the town to collect straw and would have to make careful arrangements in advance for storing it. _ Flour.—It has been shown elsewhere that the population round Shiraz is we 1 over 100,000 ; the bulk of them eat bread made of flour • there should in consequence be no difficulty in providing 10,000 men wuth flour, as long as native agency is not relied on to bring in the ('n * T,ie ' vh f r at cro , p of tlie country 60 miles round Shiraz was estimated in 1893 at over 60,000 tons (Gazetteer of Persia—Shiraz). r79 wheat from the districts. Flour is never stored in large quantities; the wheat is sent to the mill to be ground in small quantities as required. Mills are numerous round Shiraz., and there should be no difficulty in hiring one or more for the use of a force. It is very uneconomical to purchase flour ; it is better to buy wheat and have it ground under supervision 5 this is the only way of obtaining good flour with certainty ; bran and barley are largelv used as'' adul terants. Gunny bags are practically unobtainable in Shiraz ; the local equivalents are not obtainable in large quantities and, though verv strong and durable, are expensive. Gunnies should therefore be brought by a force of whatever size entering the country. Meat .—Is a commodity comparatively little subject to fluctua tion in price in Persia. The supply is very large and of very good quality. If the force arrives early in spring flocks could be bought and kept till needed ; if grazing is obtainable, it w^ould be econo mical to buy a fair reserve for the winter before the nomads go down to the plains, as once they have left, the sources of supply become considerably restricted. G/d.—This and other minor articles of diet (except dal) can probably, in part at all events, be imported into Shiraz, if large quan tities are likely to be required. Ghi is not by any means universally used ; the poorer classes both in town and country cannot afford it ; it is one of the most valuable of the products brought into the towns for sale by nomads and is also largely bought by pedlars in exchange for cloth, etc., being readily portable. There is however no large reserve of it available as a rule, and any exceptional demand would send up the price rapidly ; it is usually of excellent quality, and can generally be bought much cheaper south than north of Shiraz. The following notes on wheat cultivation in Dashtistan and Beh- behan in 1910-11 are from a report by Mr. H. G. Chick for these years, and may serve as a guide for the amount of wffieat available in these districts in normal years. The biggest holders of wheat in each district are the ruling Khans, a large portion of whose revenue is obtained from dealings in produce, though they do not trade much in their own names, pur chases can be made through their brokers.CHAPTER V. Communications (other than Railways). ^7. Communications by roads. Commercial considerations.^ I he roads of the province resolve themselves into two groups—those irom the coast to Shiraz, and those from the coast northwards. There are half a dozen or more alternative routes from Bushire to Shiraz, the best known being— (1) No. 53. Bushire-Kazaiun-Shiraz (the telegraph route). ( 2 ) No. 34. Bushire-Jirreh-Shiraz. (3) No. 33. Bushire-Fliuzabad-Shlraz. Ihe remainder are variants or combinations of these three though many attempts, to some extent successful, have been made to divert trade from the telegraph route, it remains the only one wmeh is likely to be used for any length by commercial caravans, and political considerations apart, the only road worth considering seriously as a caravan route. It is the shortest, and best furnished with fodder and water, the Fhuzabad route being deficient in res pect of the former, the Jirreh route in respect of the latter : it passes throug i two centres of trade, Burazjan and Kazarun, the latter being, m addition, a centre for muleteers, many of whom make their homes and headquarters here. The Jirreh route has no sarais few permanent villages, and is a worse track than the telegraph route vhich is saying a good deal. The Fhuzabad route suffers also from lack of sarais and villages, from which fodder could be obtained but its most serious defect is a lack of running water from which mules can be easily and rapidly watered, and the alleged existence in the vicinity of the road of a poisonous weed, which is said to be dangerous or even fatal to mules who eat it. The winter is of the opinion that any attempt to divert traffic, whether by means of a cart-road, motor road or otherwise, to either of these routes is foredoomed to failure, and that an alignment pass ing through Burazjan and Kazarun, and not unsuitable for the con struction of a carriage or motor road, can be obtained, the Shahpur River being followed from Burazjan until the Kazarun plain is struck, or, as an alternative possibility, past Shahpur and up stream to the Dasht-i-Barm, thus avoiding the formidable Kutal-i-Dukhtar. ^ From Shiraz northwards there are only two commercial roads of importance, the telegraph route (No. 59), of which the carriage route is a variant, and the sarhadd route via Asupas (No. 60). The 8182 latter is used, when the state of the country permits during the summer months, by muleteers, on account of the excellent grazing it aZI and the Saulat-ud-Dauleh forced caravans for his own pur poses to use it extensively during the years 1909 and 1910. 1 ; formerly very safe during the summer from raids by Boir Ahma li, as the Qashqai were in the vicinity, but the exactions of the lattei have more recently neutralized this advantage. It is without sarais and for commercial purposes is in every way inferioi to the main road. Except in very exceptional seasons, the tele graph route is open all the year round, except for a few days, wheie- -as the sarhadd road may be closed by snow for as much as two months at a time. The Shiraz-Isfahan road is now used very little by wheeled traf fic : it could undoubtedly be converted into a good commercial cart- track, but it seems unlikely that expenditure in this direction w ou prove remunerative. From Abadeh to Isfahan it is regulai 1 v u set and post horses will be found at every stage : south of Abadeh there are no post horses and the mails are carried on foot. The following are the only other roads of any commercial im portance :— (1) No. 33, Firuzabad-Shiraz, easily adaptable to wheeled traffic. (2) Nos. 28 and 65, Jahrum-Shiraz, easily adaptable to wheel ed traffic : passes through well-populated country.

(4) No. 28, Bandar ’Abbas-Lar-Jahrum, very little used now ; badly off for supplies and water as far as Lar, but physically easy. (5) Nos. 26 and 40; Fasa-Sarvistan-Shlraz, could be easily adapted to wheels. (6) Nos. 50 and 60, Shlraz-Bawanat-Yazd, alternative to routes from Bandar 'Abbas via Kirman or direct.

Military considerations. —A detailed account of each road will be found in the Routes in Persia, Volume III: all that will be attempted here is a brief summary of the advantages and dis advantages of the various roads leading northwards from the Gulf.(6 83 There can be no doubt that were the inhabitants to offer any organized resistance to the movement of a force up the telegraph route, it would be extremely difficult to force a passage up the series of kutals between Bushire and Kazarun and the Jirreh route would be just as bad. Ihe Firuzabad route is less objectionable, from a purely tactical point of view, and the lack of water and supplies would tell less against it in spring when water and grazing are ample. It becomes therefore a matter for consideration whether Ban dar Abbas could not be used as a base from which to despatch a force in case of necessity.' It has certain notable advantages: (1) the country passed through is generally fairly open ; (2) as far as Bar at all events it is wholly beyond the sphere of the Qashqal; and (3) very few nomads will be found in the vicinity as far as Jahrum; (4) camels if used could find fair grazing all the way. Disadvantages are: (1) lack of supplies and scanty water at several stages beyond Bandar 'Abbas ; (2) absence of telegraph line along the route. The Lingeh-Lar route is a good deal shorter, and fit for mules. We have no information with regard to it, but it seems that supplies are available, though not in large quantities, that the road is rough and crosses several steep passes, but does not pass through country tenanted by important nomad tribes, and that resistance by the inhabitants is improbable. Lingeh moreover is not on the telegraph line and troops could probably be landed and despatched up-country without the Persian Government or the tribes being aware of the fact in advance. The above facts indicate the desirability of early steps being taken to send a qualified officer to investigate and report on the Lingeh-Lar-Jahrum-Shiraz road. 129. As already explained in Chapter IV, the physical difficul ties of the main Bushire-Shiraz road make it practically impossible to move more than one regiment of cavalry or infantry, with trans port, over it simultaneously. Were resistance to be encountered, however, at the principal kutals, only infantry could hope success fully to clear the hills and occupy the passes and it would be a task to which infantry unaccustomed to hill-warfare might well prove unequal. The support of mountain guns would be essential, and indeed without the aid of artillery the numerous stone and mud rifle towers which crown the heights and various points of vantage along the road could not be captured without very heavy losses. It would seem therefore that a force intended to operate any where on the roads between Bushire and Isfahan should be composed between Bushire and Shiraz of f infantry and | cavalry, from Shiraz C361GSB84 to Dehbid the same : from Dehbid to Abadeh whcietbe co y . well suited to cavalry, l cavalry and h mfantiy. The pro t supply is much more difficult where cavalry are concerned, owing to the great bulk of fodder needed: the supply arrangements for m- fanti v present fewer difficulties, which should seldom prove serious, as comparatively little transport is needed to carry three days rations for them. 130 Communications by telegraph .—The only telegraph line in Pars is that owned and controlled by the Indo-European lelegiaph Department, running from Bushire to Tehran, via Shnaz and Isfahan keeping generally quite close to the mam road (routes Nos. 53'and 59) It would play such an important part in any military operation that no apology is needed for explaining here in some detail the methods and organization whereby it is kept in woikmg nrdfvr. At Bushire we have an Assistant Superintendent, who is, how ever responsible only for the Bushire office and the working of the cables At Shiraz there is an Assistant Superintendent m charge of the line from Abadeh to Bushire, with two Inspectors under his orders one resident at Shiraz, and responsible for the fourth or Shiraz-Bushire Section, one at Dehbid responsible for the Abadeh- Shhkz Section. From Abadeh onwards to Tehran the line is under an Assistant Superintendent, resident at Isfahan (Julfa), with two Inspectors under his orders responsible for the Abadeh-Ardistan and Ardistan-Tehran Sections. Line Inspection.— Inspectors are supposed to travel twice a year over the section in their charge, inspecting every insulator and every post and making such alterations and repairs as may be necessary. They can only travel 5 or 6 miles a day as a rule when on this duty. Owing to the disturbed state of the province these inspections havebeen much interfered with since 1908, the Isfahan- Bushire Section having been practically impassable. Line Staff .—Breaks in the line and minor repairs are executed bv the telegraph staff posted for the purpose at intervals along the line: this staff consists of signallers, glmldms and tufangchis. Sig nallers. usually Armenians, are in charge at Burazjah, Kazarun and Abadeh, whilst a European Inspector is in charge at Dehbid, as already mentioned. Ghuldms are stationed at the following places in addition to those already mentioned: Kamarij, Dashtarjan, Sivand ; at all these places there are rest houses holding at a pinch 5 or 6 Europeans and 20 or 30 natives ; they are provided with telephones and spring beds and a minimum of furniture. k .The tufangchls are an inferior class of ghuldm. In addition to the above places they are stationed at AhmadI, Dalaki, Mian Kutal, and Khan-i-Zinian ; their duties are much the same as those of yhu- lams. In each of these places there is a small room in the sarai reserved as a rest room, and furnished with an iron spring bedstead, a table and a chair. 131. Communication by telephone. —Telephone communication is practicable from Kazarun south to Burazjan and Bushire, north to Dash tar jan and Shiraz; from Dashtarjan to Kazarun, Shiraz and Sivand ; from Shiraz to Kazarun and Slvand, sometimes also to Dehbid ; from Dehbid to Sivand, Shiraz (sometimes), and Abadeh ; from AbUdeb to Dehbid and Qumisheh; from Qumisheh to Abadeh and Isfahan. Five times a day at fixed hours these con trols open out on the Persian line and communicate with head quar- tcis by telephone ; both ghuldms with hors-s ready saddled must be present at these times at the instrument, for instructions in case of interruption. As the use of the telephone involves temporary inter ruption of telegraphic work on this line, it is only at these hours that the telephone can be used, more especially as there is no means of ringing up any station, and as communication is only possible when someone is ready at the other end by previous arrangement. Tufangchls and ghuldms have portable telephone receivers only, with which they can communicate whilst actually at work on the line, or at places where there is no regular instrument. The receiver which is worked by induction can also be used, by shouting into it, as a transmitter, but the result is seldom satisfactory to the amateur, and it is best if possible to let the ghuldm send the message in Per sian to his friend at the other end. The best results are obtained at the first and last tests, ?’.e., at 6 a.m. and 8-30 p.m., when the instruments at the head office are not working. 132. Projected telegraph lines .— (1) Bushire-Jam-Ldr-Bandar 'Abbas. —This line was surveyed by Mr. S. Butcher, Indo-European Telegraph Department, in 1889 as part of a projected line to connect Bushire by land with Karachi; the project was not pressed, however, and the construction of the Central Persian Line obviates any necessity for it. (2) Shirdz-Fasd-Ddrab-Furg-Bandar ’Abbas-Jdshk. —This line was surveyed by Mr. J. B. Preece, Indo-European Telegraph Department, in 1887 ; it presents no special difficulties and would connect Bandar ’Abbas with the inland telegraph system of Persia, which is mucli to be desired : the alignment however follows86 for the most part no regular caravan track and would be difficult to keep in repair; nomads would probably frequently damage it, and no means of restraining them now exist. In the event of a railway being built from Bandar ’Abbas to Shiraz via Lar and Jahrum, it would be very necessary to build a telegraph line along it, with a branch from Lar to Lingeh : such a line would pass for the most part through lands not occupied by nomads * and would consequently be relatively safe from wilful damage. Such a line would be an effective alternative to the Bushire-SMraz line, which has suffered greatly of late years at the hands of the Qashqai nomads, who would not touch a Bandar ’Abbas-Shiraz line at any point. *CHAPTER VI. Climate and Health. 133. The extremes of heat and cold will be found in summer and winter respectively in the province; the main road to Isfahan tra verses plains 7,000' above sea level, and deep with snow in winter for days together, the temperature falling to as low as 15° F. in winter with a maximum shade temperature of 90° F. in summer. In consequence, during December and January it is frequently almost impassable to caravans, especially as the plains, marshy at all times, are deep in mud, consequent upon heavy rains, which commence about the middle of November and may be expected at intervals till the beginning of May. Snow falls at 5,000' and above from 1st December onwards. In December Ala-ud-Dauleh marching up from Bushire lost four or five men from cold. On the passes between Shiraz and Kazarun it may lie for as long as three weeks, but, as a rule, not more than ten days ; at such times the road is practically impassable. The minimum temperature m Shiraz m winter is sometimes as low as 17° at night. Heat, at and above 5,000', begins about the end of June and lasts till the end of August, when there is always a marked fall in temper ature. It is well to sleep in the open air if possible from May to October; dew falls from the middle of September onwards in the plain above 3,000' and, later, below this altitude. The best season for moving troops is from 1st April to end of May and from middle of September to middle of November, but it is possible to move troops over the main routes all the year round. 134. There is in Shiraz an utter absence of sanitation or any organized system of drainage, each house having its own badly coii structed cesspool, cleared out at the will of the individual, thus ren dering the whole sub-soil saturated with refuse matter. The water itself is good, but, owing to a bad system of transportation into the town by means of qandts, which are in some sections open, it is easilv infected and during an epidemic practically out of control within the city walls. Considering the unsanitary condition of the town with its badly-planned and crowded houses, dirty, narrow streets, uncon trolled water-supply and absence of any system of drainage brnraz is singularly free from epidemics of specific diseases : the 8 788 periodic (usually annual) epidemics of diphtheria, small-pox, ente- ie, chicken-pox and measles do not cause a large mortality, i icse usually occur either in spring or autumn, with dysentery some what severe during the height of the summer. Epidemics of choleia occur at intervals of a decade or more. The last epidemic, of 1904, was, in comparison with that of former years, very severe, the morta lity being probably not less than 5,000. The specific infectious dis- eases—typhus: rubella : intermittent, scarlet, dengue and yellow fever: beri beri: plague: hydrophobia, and actinous cases are prac tically unknown. Cases of anthrax, tetanus and leprosy are occa sionally, though rarely, seen. The only striking points about health conditions of Shiraz are the marked number of cases of diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva, dyspepsia, ascites and venereal diseases, specially the latter. • 135. In Shiraz itself the direct rays of the sun are felt through the day out of all proportion to the general temperature. The tem perature seldom remains at a high degree for more than three or four days at a time, but a south-west wind during the summer months is often unpleasantly warm and relaxing. In spite of the praises lavish ed on the climate by former travellers, there seems little doubt that it is often trying to Europeans, and there is a consensus of opinion amongst residents that the climate is less good than at first sight appears : though excellent in winter and spring, it is spoilt in the summer and autumn by the prevalence of malarial fever. The main conclusion to be drawn from the foregoing survey of the climate and sanitary conditions of Shiraz would seem to be— (1) Troops cannot be housed under canvas either in winter or summer, except for short periods, without danger to health ; this is particularly the case in winter with native troops and cavalry. (2) Careful sanitary arrangements are necessary to protect troops from disease : they should not be cantoned close to the town, and should draw their water from wells if possible : there are several good wells in the neighbourhood of the Consulate and it would seem a very desirable precaution both on military and sanitary grounds to have one dug within the Consulate grounds.89 CHAPTER VII. BlOGRAlHICAL NOTES ON, AND GENEALOGICAL TREE OF, PERSIAN NOTABLES OF EARS. 136. An account oft! e Tribal Chiefs of Fars and their genealogies will be found in Chapter III, dealing with the nomad tribes of Fars, and also in the Gazetteer under the districts concerned. 137. Qawami (Hdshimieh) family .—The Hashimleh family of Shiraz, whose family tree is attached, was founded by one HajI Hashim, said by some to be a converted Jew, but figuring in the family’s genealogy as descendant of the famous HajI Qawam-ud-Din, who flourished in the 14th century, and is mentioned by Hafiz. The only prominent living members of the family are Qawam- ul-Mulk and his son Intizam-ul-Mamalik. The Nizam-us-Sultaneh, Governor-General of Fars in 1911, imprisoned them both soon after his arrival at Shiraz and it was arranged that they should leave for Europe. On their way to the coast they were ambushed by Qash- qais, who had been sent for this purpose by the Saulat-ud-Dauleh, with the cognizance, no doubt, of the Nizam. Nasr-ud-Dauleh was killed. Qawam-ul-Mulk escaped and took sanctuary in the British Consulate. r lkis was in April 1911. The Nizam and Saulat made every endeavour to induce His Majesty’s Consul to hand him over or eject him, but without success. Afkham-ul-Mulk, Nun. Akram-ul-Mulk, Qawami. ’Ata-ud-Dauleh, Nuri.

The Nizam’s efforts were for some time crowned with a con siderable measure of success, but from the first his effort to capture the Qawam’s house and those of his adherents was frustrated by the skill and courage of the latter’s wife Liqa-ud-Dauleh 1 , a daughter of the Qashqai llkhdnl Nasrullah Khan. This remarkable woman showed most remarkable ability in organising and directing the opposition to the nefarious design of the Nizam and the Saulat. She was assisted by her son Intizam-ul-Mamalik, a young man of 27. Finally, a considerable body of Arab tribesmen from the II- Khamseh, of which confederacy the Qawam was then in charge, came to his assistance and the Qashqai under the Saidat eventually withdrew. The Qawam left the Consulate in October 1911 after a resi dence of nearly 6 months in “ bast” During this interval between the Nizam’s departure in October 1911 and the arrival of Mukhbir-us-Saltaneh in April 1912, the the Qawam acted as Governor General of the Province. 1 Died in 1913.92 The Nur! family of Shiraz. 138. The only member of this family who has attained sufficient notoriety in Ears to be deserving of mention is Biha-us-Saltaneh, who took a prominent part in organizing demonstrations against the British Consulate soon after the Qawam-ul-Mulk had taken sanctuary, though this did not deter him from heading the first deputation that approached the Qawam-ul-Mulk in order to make proposals for peace. C361G3B N95 139 ABADEH-I-IQLlD.— Lat. 31° 11' Long. 52° 4L Elev. 6,100'. A town about half-way between Shiraz and Isfahan, on the road between them ; it is the chief place of a district of the same name under a Deputy Governor (subordinate to Shiraz), who is genera ly a local man and has for the last 3 years been a nominee of the Ilkhan* of the Qashqai. The town is walled, but there is a considerable population resident without he alls and in adjacent villages. The'estimated population is 6,000, but this includes a few villages in the immediate vicinity. There are two schools, one belonging to the Bahais, in which English is taught, and one for the h The Indo-European Telegraph Department have a station here, with a clerk in charge ; telephone communication with Qumisheh and Dehbid. Supplies plentiful, as also is fruit, in season; good wood-carving is done in the town ; water is good and abundant; climate good ; the winter is severe but less so than at Dehbid. During the past 3 years most of the sheep ot the district have been looted by the Boir Ahmadi, who are estimated to have carried off nearly 500,000 in all. Boundaries.—The boundary of the district, where it crosses the Shiraz- Isfahan road, is somewhat vague. According to one account it follows the ridge of the Gard-i-Gir range between Yazd-i khast and Aminabad, accord ing to another account (confirmed by the Fdrsndmeh) it lies between Am na- bad and Maqsud Begl. The southern boundary crosses the road a few miles north of Khaneh Khurreh ; to the east the Dum-i-Lar range divides it from the Ab kiih district, the Talingi pass being the boundary on the Abadeh-Abrkuh road. To the west a fairly well-defined range separates the district from that known as Ohehar Dangeh. Population. —The annexed list gives a total of 2,800 houses in the district,- excluding the towns of Abadeh and Iqlid. Adding 200 to this number, on account of 12 villages of which we have no statistics, gives us a tota 1 of 3,000 houses ; and 1,000 for Iqlid and 500 for Abadeh and we have 4,50 ) for the whole district. This means, assuming the correctness of our figures, a sedentary population of about 25,000. The population includes some 500 Bahais. Nomads scarcely live in the district at all, but it has nevertheless suffered greatly from their depredations in recent years. The Yazd-i-khast-Amin- abad part of the main road is particularly liable to raids by Boir Ahmadi and other tribes, but all the roads in the district are at present extremely unsafe. Miss Boss, a lady doctor travelling from Ispahan to Shiraz, was twice robbed in November 1911, once near Shulgistan, once near Khaneh Khurreh; on the second occasion the guards with her took to flight, leaving her to the robbers. Prodwts and Commerce. —Wheat, barley, cotton, gum ; a little dairy pro duce and wool are also available for export. Coal is said to exist in the Khaneh Khurreh hills. Abadeh, rather than Iqlid, is the collecting and distributing centre of the district; it has a fairly well-stocked bazaar, furnished principally from Ispahan, at prfesent, owing to the disturbed state of the Shiraz-Abadeh road.99 Name.

The village stands upon an isolated block of conglo merate 70' high and 300 to 400 yds. long in a nala 100' deep and 300 yds. broad, running from S.-W. to N.-E. The village contains about 200 houses (of which 80 are occupied) with a pop. of 1,000. It has, so to speak, overflowed its limits, and there is now a small hamlet outside, close to the S.-W. end of the rock. The village is connected to the mainland by a wooden bridge, 15' long by 6' broad, removable at will. This bridge is on the S.-W. end and leads to a single doorway in the rock. There is one very deep well, but the water Is not good. At the base of cliffs are a number of caves hidden in the rock, which serve as pens for sheep and cattle, and as stables for horses. A swift stream runs down the centre of the ravine S. of the village and its water is milky almost to opaqueness. It is crossed by a strong stone bridge in good repair. The stream itself is ford able. On the S. bank stands a cararansarai in a dilapi dated condition; it is said to be the work of Sh h ’Abbas. On tne N. bank, nearly opposite the caravan- mrai, stands the c ha pur- khdneh. Wheat and barley are cultivated on either side of the stream for some distance. The village is commanded from the cliffs on either side. The Isfahan-Shiraz road descends into this ravine and leaves it again, but the slopes do not present a serious obstacle to traffic. Water is obtained from the two qanats ; 6,500 lbs. of grain are sown per annum ; taxes 1,300 T. 140 ABADEH-I-TASHK— A small district, bounded on north by Raushan Kuh, and the Qun- quri and Sarchahan districts : on the south by Lake Nargis or Tashk, on the east by the Niriz district, on the west by that of Kurbal and Arsinjan. Its inhabitants are of the Lashani and Chehar-rahi tribes (v. q.). Maliat 8,000 T. per annum less 1,000 T., the pay of the Zdbit. The chief village is Khwajeh Jamali. The probable population is about 6,500. Products .—Grain and dairy produce.102 /~~V 143. AHRAM.— Lat. 28° 52'. Long. 51° 17' Elev. 360'. The chief town of the Tangistan district 27 miles E.-S.-E. of Bushire and 17 miles N.-N.-W. Khurmuj, near the right bank of the Bahush or Ahram stream, a little below its exit from the hills. The town covers an area of 1| square miles, and is enclosed by date groves to the N. and S., and partly to the W. On the S.-W. flank is a stone fort, the residence of the Khan of Tangistan : walls 40' high, towers at corners, 250 houses are inhabited, of which many are mere mat huts. The population of the town is about 500, mainly Tangistanis, who are cultivators ; the chief crops are wheat, barley and melons. Animals re ported to number 20 horses, 5 mules, 40 camels, 200 donkeys, 70 cattle, 500 sheep and goats. Date palms 20,000 ; grazing excellent; water brackish. Hot sulphurous springs exist in the hills near town, and are said to have a medi cinal value. Good camping grounds. The Tang-i-Bahush N.-E. Ahram is passable from April to December when the stream is fairly dry ; Monteith was of opinion that it could be made practicable for guns without much difficulty. 144. ’ALAMARVDASHT.— Lat. 27°36' Long. 53° 7' Elev. 2,200':— A village and district of the same name, formerly in Laristan, now reckoned as part of Ears proper. The district is the t ul of Saulat-ud-Dauleh. The Asir district (q.v.) is often looked upon as part of ’Alamarvdasht; it is not clear whether it also belongs to the Saulat. Boundaries. —The district is bounded on the N. by that of Khunj, on the E. bv Laristan, on the W. by Asir, on the S. by the district of Galeh- dar or Fal. Its products are wheat, barley, pulse and a little tobacco. Its total sedentary population may be estimated at about 4,000. Nomad tribes (Qashqal, principally Shish BulukI) winter in the district, which forms their southernmost limit. The district includes the following villages, all in the ’Alamarvdasht valley :— Name.

A small port of the Lirawl district, but not forming part of it adminis tratively : 85 miles N.-N.-W. Bushire and at an equal distance E.-N.-E. of the Shatt-al-Arab bar. The town stands upon a low coast running N. and S., and consisting of a strip of rocky land 10' to 15' above sea-level with swamps behind extending several miles inland. Half a mile to the S. is a little cultivation with some trees, and to the E. is a plain containing a few villages dependent on Dilam. A square fort stands in the middle of the town and 1£ m. to the N.-E. is the fort of Tunub, which protects the water supply. The town formerly belonged to the Dutch, the remains of whose factory were visible not many years ago. The anchorage for vessels, about 3| m. off the shore, is sheltered from the shirndl and partially from the kaus : the bottom is of soft mud and the depth of water four fathoms ; native craft lie close in to the beach in a creek in a mud flat. Landing is difficult, because of the mud, and cargoes are unloaded and loaded by means of donkeys.113 Population .—The population is from 1,000 to 2,000 souls of the BehbehanI tribe and is entirely Shi’ah ; all are Persian-speaking, but about one-third of them can talk Arabic as well. Some are cultivators in the surrounding Lirawi district, others are sailors or fishermen, and the remainder merchants or shop-keepers. Resources and Supplies .—The resources of the place are inconsiderable; drinking water is scarce and indifferent; it is brought from Tunub about 1 rn. distant. About 20 horses, 200 donkeys, and 500 sheep are owned by the inhabitants. There are ten bums, 10 mdshuwehs and 20 small fishing boats. Commerce .—Dilam is the port of the wheat-growing districts of Ziadan and Behbehan, and to this circumstance owes such trade as it enjoys. The oversea trade is principally with Bushire, but also (for wheat) with Muham- merah, andtoa limited extent with Kuwait, Bahrain and Masqat. Wheat, barley, straw, gum, linseed, ghi and dried figs are the principal exports, rice, coffee, sugar, tea, pepper, turmeric, dried limes (Masqat) and kerosine its prin cipal imports. In 1911 3,464 tons of wheat were imported chiefly to Muham- merah. The fishermen here, using the drag-net, catch large quantities of sir fish. They are split and dried and sent to Basrah by sea and to the surrounding villages on donkeys. The baz .ar contains 90 shops. Ordinary Persian • currency is in use ; the weights used are a local man of 14 lbs. 8| oz., and the Hdshim man, equivalent to 10 local man*. The unit of length is the gaz of 40' or 41.' Climate and Sanitation .—Ophthalmia is the prevailing disease here ; there is little fever and no small-pox. Administration .—Bandar Dilam is ruled by two local Khans, brothers, who are under the authority of the Governor of the Gulf Ports, to whose charge it was relegated during the political re-arrangement of the Persian Gulf littoral, which followed the fall of the Zill-us-Sultan in 1888. The Khans, who defer considerably to Saiyids and Mullas, dispose of criminal matters, and civil causes are settled by Kazls and Mullas. The original rulers are said to have been Bani Tamim ’Arabs, and after them Ban! Khali- * feh. The latter were displaced 70 or 80 years ago by the father of the pre sent Khans. Haji Tahir, who profited by the absence of the ruling family during an epidemic of plague to make an arrangement with the Governor of Behbehan and take possession of the place. Revenue .—land revenue of Dilam is trifling, but the receipts from sea-customs are considerable ; they were formerly farmed by the Khans for 12,000 krans per annum, but since the initiation of direct management he has received compensation at the rate of 5,000 krdns per annum. The inhabitants are fairly well armed. 152. BANDAR RIGL— at. 29° 24', Long. 50° 41'. The port and chief town of the Haiat Daud District, 30 m. N.-N.-W. of Bushire. It stands upon a low sandy coast, which runs N. and S. There is a creek at the town, fronted by two sandbanks, inside which native craft lie aground at low water. On the N. and S. the town is adjoined by cultivated lands belonging to adjacent villages, and on the E., at about 2 m. distance, is a chain of low sandhills, which114 (screen it from the view of the traveller as he approaches on that side. The only defensive work is the loop-holed, semi-fortitied residence of the Khan, built of stones and mud. The village possesses a few date trees, and two unimportant shrines. Administration .—Bandar Rig is the residence of Haidar Khan, the heredi tary local Governor of the Haiat Baud District (q.v.). There is a Custom j)ost here. History .—The general history of Bandar Rig is included in that of the Haiat Daiid District. Herein 1754 the English blast India Company, whose trade in the Gulf had been seriously crippled by the troubles arising out of the Afghan invasions, endeavoured to found a factory and sent out an agent. Owing to Dutch opposition and intrigues, the attempt was a failure, and a few years later Bushire Avas selected as a substitute. A little later in the same century a famous Gulf pirate, an exceptional ruffian, of the name of Mir Muhanna, had his stronghold here. His foit was taken and razed to the ground by British troops. Bandar Rig is said to be very ancient. * Population .—The inhabitants number about 2,000 souls : they are a mon grel breed in whom Arab and Lur blood predominates. Persian, modified by the Lur dialect , is the language spoken. The people are culti\ r ators, boat men, sailors and traders; they are reputed peaceable and not fanatical, but they are fairly well armed with Martini rifles, about 3 to every house. They are Shi’ah Muhammadans, but traditions survive of a time when some of them were Gabrs. Trade and Bandar Rig is a very prosperous port, dealing princi pally with Bushire and Kuwait and serving the considerable district of Haiat Daiid and a part of the district of Shabankareh. The bazaar con tains about 50 shops and trade has increased during the last few years; the monthly imports are said now to average 100 packages or bags of sugar, 5 cases of t( a, 50 bags of Indian rice, 100 cases of kerosine oil and 50 bales of Man chester prints, all from Bushire. There is also a considerable importation of camels from Kuwait. Exports are wheat, barley, gum, wool and cattle, all to Bushire except wheat, of which about ^ is sent to Muhammareh and other Gulf Ports. The Persian kran is the basis of currency, but rupees and dollars also circulate. The unit of weight is a Hdshim man equal to 26 Tabriz man of Bushire, and consequently different to the Hdshim man of that place, which is equivalent to 16 Tabriz man of the same town. The stan dard of length is a gaz of 8| inches. In 1911 some 3,000 tons of wheat were exported. Resources and communications .—Water is obtained from wells, and some wheat, barley and straw are locally procurable. About 50 horses, 100 camels and 150 donkeys, also 100 cattle and 600 sheep and goats are owned in the town and there are 8 bums besides 10 mdshuwehs and 15 fishing boats. A Persian post office was opened here about 1901 and a telegraph office about 1904: but very little use is made of the latter, which is in termediate between Burazjan and Bandar Dilam on the Burazjan-Ahwaz115 branch line. Thera is frequent communication with Bushire by sailing boat. liovtes. See Routes 54 and 55. 153. BAWANAT.— Lat. 30 27'; Long. 53° 42'. A village and district of the same name, the third stage from Shiraz to Yazd : separated from the latter by deserts. Boundaries .—The district is bounded on the N. and E. by the dis tricts of Shahr-i-Babak and Yazd, on the S. by Abadeh-i-Tashk and Da~ rab, on the W. by Qunquri and Sarchahan. Commerce and Produce .—The district possesses many gardens and abun dance of fruit, specially raisins, which it exports, in addition to a great quantity of wheat (which goes principally to Yazd). walnuts, fruit of the sinjid and jauz-aqhand, i.e., fresh or pared pears or peaches rolled round walnuts. The few Europeans who have visited this place generally have come in search of khar-i-girdu, i.e., the excrescences of the walnut tree : some trees that had been matured were bought for 400 krs. Good wooden spoons are manufactured as also fantastically shaped padlocks, but the locks, except for being shaped like birds and sometimes requiring two keys to open them, do not differ from ordinary Persian locks. Inhabitants .—The people call themselves Turks and have the appearance of such : the language spoken is Persian (Yazdi) with a smattering of tribal Turkish and Arabic. The winter is extremely rigorous. The style of building in the district is with a layer of mahk or liquorice root or camel thorn between each chineh of earth. Ill ! Name. Lat. Long. o r Note*.

Mules are bred in the district, and the town is a centre for charvadars. Inhabitants. —The nomadic inhabitants of the district are mainly Kuhgalu and Mamassani tribesmen ; there is also an admixture of other tribes, im migrants from other districts, and non-descript people, partly Arab, partly Persian, forming a distinct type 0 and generally known as Behbehanis. The Zaidan district is under Behbehan. The town. —The town is some 3| miles in circumference and is surrounded bv a mud wall flanked with circular towers and bastions. The south east corner is occupied by a castle called Kaleh Naranj. There are no pre tentious houses : the town is mostly in ruins : there is no bazaar worthy of the name. Population. —The local officials claim the population to number 30,000 but this is clearly an over-calculation. Probably 6,000 to 8,000 is a truer estimate. In the town there are two parties, the Behbehanis and the Qana- watis, in the proportion of one-third of the former to two-thirds of the latter. The Qanawat tribe originally came from Kiifa in Turkey. The Behbehanis are neither Persians nor Arabs, but a kind of mixture of the two. The chief man among the Behbehanis is (1903) Muhammad Mu’in-ul-Islam, who was formerly examiner in Persian and Arabic at Bombay for 10 years. He has a cousin called Saiyid Muntazir, who has a trade connection with Bombay, and is said to be friendly to the English. Trade and resources. —Behbehan is an important town, however, being a concentrating and distributing centre for the caravan trade of the sur rounding district. Owing to the lack of a proper bazaar, supplies of grain are, as a rule, scanty in the town. The Behbehan plain provides grazing for some 3,000 sheep and cattle, and, except in years of drought, wheat is obtainable in the neighbourhood in large quantities. This is the principal article of export. Bhasa also is obtainable in practically unlimited quan tities. The water-supply under present conditions is meagre and bad, being supplied by a small drain, which also forms the favourite washing place of the population. Drinking water is stored in ab-ambdrs and is brought from a distance of 6 miles. There are three tanks here, measur ing 50'x20 / x6', of covered masonry. Under a more energetic regime the town might be well supplied by qandts from the Marun- river. Owing ta the extensive caravan traffic, of which Behbehan is the centre, transport is generally available : 2,500 good mules could probably be collected with out much difficulty : donkeys and cows 10,000, horses 500, sheep 8,000. There are 300 to 400 mules of all descriptions working on the Bandar Dilam road from here. Curzon mentions that mina work, or Enamelling in gold, silver or copper, still survives here. itowtes.—See Nos. 61, 62, 63, 64 and 65. q2121 Name. Lat. Long. Notes.

There is a mud fort close to the village, and two others in the plain about a mile to the east. One of the latter is the mud fort (Kaleh-i-Gili) built when Karim Khan was reigning in Shiiaz (1780) : it is a square earthwork with a side of 120 yards, and had a tower every 13 yards. The other is the “ Fort of the Fire Well ” so called from the dis covery of naphtha in a well hard by : it is a tower fort with a wall on a mound. Forts and wells are in ruins now. • - Karian stands in the middle of three rocky hills, and these also are said to have been fortified. The tradition of the place is that Shah Karan was besieged here by 12,000 Mussulfnans, when the J Arabs first invaded Persia. While theyName. Lat. Long. Notes. 0 / o Kulfin Kureh 27 55 Lagharan .. Sargah Siah Mansur were at their prayers he sallied out and slew them all without resistance. “ In the Mussalman camp were 40 virgins, 37 of whom, ip answer to their prayer for deliverance, were swallowed up by the earth. The remaining three fled in various directions. “ The cave which sheltered one is called Ghar Bibi, or “ Lady’s Cave ” to this day. The second died of exhaustion at a shrine called Bibi Darmandeh or “ Tired-out Lady ” a famous place for childless wives. Hajat, whohad conquered Qir, hearing of the catastrophe, came to avenge his brother, but could not take the fort until Shah Karan was betrayed by his wife, who was in love with Hajat. Hajat married and then killed her, as he had no wish to be betrayed. Being informed that the way to find Shah Karan’s treasure was to make blood flow down the hill-side, he proceeded to out the throats of the inhabitants at the top of the hill, and an old woman, when her turn came, revealed the secret, by advising him to get the great store of wine from the vault and pour that down the hill side ; the last jar of wine hid the door of the treasure house. Karian was evi dently once a flourishing and well-built place. Conical domes of db-ambdrs rise among the ruined houses, testifying to a large water-supply and a large popu lation in former years; the neighbour hood is infested by robbers, and the few remaining inhabitants complain of the misgovernment of the Qajars. As a proof of the insecurity of property it may be observed that the herdsmen on the hills are armed with guns. The sur rounding country in good seasons ought to be very fertile, and there is some very fine wheat under Karian* An ancient qandt waters the village.” 35 miles N.

A district and village, which latter is the chief place of Rashtistan, and the seat of the Khan, who under the Governor-General of hars rules the greater part of that district. It stands on the plain, dominated by the Gisehkan Mountain, less than 10 miles to the east. It is surrounded by date groves. Ordinary houses are poor but there is a fine stone sarai with loopholed walls, commanding the town and capable of being used as a fort. The town is not a place of strengt-h, being commanded by hills. It contains several minor shrines. The district is bounded on the — North. By the river Rudhilleh from Haft Jush, where it meets Angag territory, to Durudgah and thence by the Daliki or Shur river to some few miles past Bfineh Mirza (he boundary with Daliki is about 3 miles past Qarafil Khaneh, at a sulphur stream crossing the caravan road, and this boundary line then mounts to the summit of the hills. East. —Boundary is along the summit of the Gisehkan range past Kuh-i- Bagh-i-Taj. South .—Boundary crosses the entrance to the Haft Mulla ravine, south of Nanizak and Jamileh: between Sarkurreh and Samal and Gulun- gun in Tangistan : then north of BuTfaris and Gandumriz_ in Tangistan : north of Ab-i-Tawil in Chahkutah and south of ’Isa- wand. \y e st .—Boundary is north-east from ’Isawand (Nukal being in Angali and Jarrafi in Burazjan) to Haft Jush. The capital, Burazjan, contains perhaps 800 houses and 4,000 inhabitants, and has a fine caravansarai. The district is entirely agricultural, a quantity of tobacco being produced besides grain. The following villages are in the Burazjan district :— Burazjan. Zlarafc. Band-i-Ruz. Banar. Sar Kurroh. Jaim. Dar-i-Chitu. Jarrafi. 'Isawand (along caravan route). Saifabad. Chah-i-Khanl (near caravan route). Kullul. Chah-i-’Arabi. Khushab (along caravan route), Khushmakan. Giz-i-Bid. Deh-i-Nau. Bagh Hisar (along caravan route). Qaraul Khaneh. (In the Glsehkun mountains.) Khurmi. Kakun. Lardeh, Bagh-i- NakhI, Kharagah. Ma’dabad. Bargain. Bunneh. Rahdar (along caravan route). Jamileh. Bagh-i-Chanar.124 Communications. —There are paths, practicable for lightly laden animals up the GIsehkan range (i) by Lardeh, (w) by Khurmi to the foot of the Kuh-i- Bagh Taj, whence the track is too difficult for animals. The Bagh-i-Taj crest is known by several names : from east to west Kamar-i-Zardak, Kamar- i-Shainahu, Kamar-i-Dubareh, Kamar-i-Bardisar. The two last paths to the top of the crest are Rah-i-Kardak and Rah or Pul-i-Bariki. Burazjan is 43 miles from Bushire, on the post route to Shiraz via Ahmadi and 28 via Shif. The I. E. T. D. line from Bushire to Shiraz passes through this place and is here connected with Behbehan and the ’Arabistan system. Climate. —The thermometer rises to a maximum of 107° in the shade in July and August and falls to a minimum of 53° in December, January and February. Population. —The village suffered from famine some years ago, 75 per cent, are said to have fallen victims to it. Curzon in 1885 estimated it at 6,000: now about 2,500 in 500 houses: people are traders, cultivators, and muleteers. Principal tribes are Paparis, who have dominated the place since they expelled the Bag owner less than a century ago, Qaidan, recent immigrants, and some Saiyids. Inhabitants are fairly civilized, but for obvious reasons (in Persia) avoid needless display of well-being. The opium habit is prevalent. Trade, resources and supplies. —170 shops; no local manufactures. The town'depends on agriculture and dates transit trade to Shiraz. Burazjan is the only trade centre in Dashtistan and its trade is an epitome of that of the district in consequence. The exports all go to Bushire and comprise wheat, barley, melons, tobacco, gum, wool, firewood, charcoal and limes. Imports are piece-goods, rice, coffee, tea, sugar, opium, spices. Water supply good from deep, wells, but slightly brackish. Excellent water can be brought from hills a few miles east of town. Local yuan is 18 lbs. 11 oz. giving a Hdshim man of 139 lbs. Revenue. —The MdPydt of Burazjan is 5,300 Tumdns: the revenue of the Khan is said to be some 16,000 Tumans by taxation of land under cultiva tion, and 20,000 Tumans from Rahddri, ’Aldfi and the taxation of caravans, besides sale of monopolies of gum, etc. Ziarat used many years ago to be a separate entity in the hands of the “ Begs,” so-called ; but one of the family of the Khan of Burazjan now resides there. Administration. —Ruled by a Khan, who administers the greater part of Dashtistan: it and its dependencies are occasionally farmed by the Governor of the Gulf ports. Ghazanfar-us-Saltaneh some years ago took over the government from his aged father. He and his father have acquired great wealth from black mail on the caravans passing through Burazjan, especially from monopolies of the sale of grain to animals. He had to take to the Gisehkan mountains when Ijlal-ud-Dauleh, Vazlr of Ears, attacked the chief of Dashtistan, but C361G.S.B, t»125 returned later. He is married to a daughter of Isma il Khun of Shaban- kareh, but the bitterest blood-feud reigns between him and this Khan on account of the district of Zira, which formerly was farmed by one of the Khans of Burazjan, but has for 15 years been let by Nizam-us-Saltaneh to the Khan of Shabankareh. Ghazanfar-us-Saltaneh has repeatedly tried to have his father-in-law evicted and himself given the lease^ Constant bloodshed goes on between Shabankareh, Zira and Burazjan on this account, and raids are common. A further cause of hostility was the seizure and imprisonment in the autumn of 1911 by Ghazanfar-us-Saltaneh of his cousin Mirza ’All Khan and the latter's sons on a charge_ of conspiracy ; Mirza ’All Khan’s sister being wife of Ismail Khan of Shabankareh. Ghazanfar-us-Saltaneh has been noted for his oppression of caravans: and for his hostility to the British in 1909 and again in 1911, when he was actively stirring up agitation both before and after the passage of the Central India Horse. Outwardly fair spoken, he is a difficult man to deal with : he is the most noted buyer of, and dealer in, smuggled arms and ammuni tion among the headmen of the Bushire littoral and hinterland. The ruling family of the Khans are descended from a certain Mulla Muhammad, who came from the district of Kam Firuz, became a servant of the then dynasty, married the Khan’s daughter and became chief Burazjan. The genealogy is said to be as follows:— Mullfi Muhammad. I Mullft Haji. Shah Mansur (given the title of Khan by Karim Kh&amp;n Zend). Ill Salim Khun.

CHAHKtJTAH—L at. 29° 3'; Long. 51° 11'. A large village and small district of the same name, bounded on the west by the Bushire on the north by Angall and Dashtistan, on the east by Dashtistan, on the south by Tangistan. The village is the headquarters of an Arab Shaikh, who rules it, with several adjoining villages in subor dination to the Governor of the Gulf ports: 150 houses of Damukh Arabs (Dawaslr of Bahrain, originally Sunnis, but now Shi’ahs), and a few Persians of the Zanganeh tribe constitute the population of the village. Wheat, barley, melons and dates are the crops grown in the district. Estimated population of district 1,500. With Chahkutah and its surrounding villages is now included Ahmadi, which was formerly a separate entity owned by the family of which the Telegraph Ghulams Mulla Abdullah and Agha Muhammad Quli are now the representatives. Agha Mustapha, Bahmiyar of Chaghadak and Tul-i-Siah being a near relation, Shaikh Husain of Chahkutah ejected them many years ago, but has had a hard struggle to retain Ahmadi, the importance of which arises from its position as the first stage on the caravan route. Tul-i-Siah and Chaghadak occupy a vague position : Shaikh Husain Khan of Chahkutah considers himself the suzerain, but Agha Haidar, the Zabit of Chaghadak ; and his brothers pay revenue independently to the Governor of the Gulf Ports, and similarly collect road exactions at Chaghadak. Agha Haidar has, however, always assisted Shaikh Husain in his quarrel, and looks to him for support. The Zdbit of Tul-i-Siah also claims the villages of ’All-Changl and Gurak on the borders of Tangistan, but these are now managed by the ruler of Tangistan. The boundaries of Chahkutah and Chaghadak are on the— North-west. —Between Husainaki and Hasandun in Angali. North. —Between Husainaki and Tsawand in Burazjan, between ’Isa- wand in Burazjan and Abu-Tawil: between Tul-Ashki and Bulfaris in Tangistan. East. —Between Chahkutah, and Samal in Tangistan. South. —Chahkutah and Chah-i-Pir in Tangistan, between Chaghadak and Buneh-Gaz and Gurak in Tangistan. West. —The district extends into the Mashileh between Chaghadak and the main land of Bushire. The mdliat of Chahkutah is 1,500, of Ahmadi 700 Tumdns: that of Chagha dak and Tul-i-Siah 750: the Khan’s revenue is derived from taxation of culti vated land, and also from Rdhddri and ’Alaji from caravans passing Ahmadi. Chahkutah and the nearest villages have been for generations in this family, which boasts Arab descent. The present ruler, Shaikh Husain, has been constantly at war during the past few years. His brothers Shaikh ’AH, Muhammad and ’Abdullah united to force him to share their father’s villages with them and they were for years in sanctuary in Burazjan and Angall. Shaikh ’All was killed in a quarrel by Shaikh Husain in 1910, Shaikhs Muhammad and ’Abdullah raised a revolt in 1911 and were joined by Zair Khidar of Tangistan and Ahmad Khan of Angali. During some sharp fight ing the elder brother was killed and Shaikh ’Abdullah wrounded, took “ bast” in the town Residency with about 80 of the Zanganeh tribe, inhabit ants of Chahkutah. Later they went back, and Shaikh ’Abdullah was given127 the village of Abu-Tawll by Shaikh Husain, but blood-feud and enmity still prevail between the brothers. Shaikh Husain was for many years a close ally of Daria Beg!, and introduced Zair Khidar, then an unimportant Kadkhudd of Tangistan,’ to his favour. In 1909 Daria Beg! accompanied Shaikh Husain in an expedition against Zair Khidar and again in 1910, but then the Governor of the Gulf Ports made friendship with the Tangistani chief and authorised him to attack Shaikh Husain in support of the latter’s brothers. Much fighting ensued, but Nizam-us-Saltaneh on his way to Shiraz took up the cudgels for Shaikh Husain, sent Qashqais under Amir-ul-Mulk to assist Shaikh Husain, and the Tangistanis and Angalis were beaten off. Shaikh Husain manifested his enmity against Daria Begi by threatening to cap ture him in Bushire, in consequence of which Daria Begi after his dismis sal took ' bast ” with the Residency. Mavaqqar-ud-Dauleh, when appointed Governor, at first supported Shaikh Husain, then turned against him and favoured Zair Khidar. Shaikh Husain was openly defiant to the Governor as long as Nizam-us-Saltaneh was in power, and since then has been invoking the Residency’s support to prevent the Governor from taking his revenge. In 1911 he contracted with Nizam-us-Saltaneh to be answerable for the revenue of Ahram, Khaviz and Tangistan for the sum of 46,000 1 Conans for a period of 6 years by arrangement with the Tangistani Khans, proteges of Nizam-us-Saltaneh. In October 1911 these were, however, turned out of Tangistan by an uprising on the part of Zair Khidar, who besieged some of the Khans with one of Shaikh Husain’s sons and men in the fort of Kalat. The outstanding feature of Chahkutah politics is blood-enmity with Angali on the one hand, and Zair Khidar of Tangistan on the other, and insubordi nation as regards the present Governor of Bushire. Possession of Ahmadi, which has often been threatened, is the most important factor for the Shaikh because of the large revenue derived from exactions from muleteers. He is also desirous of obtaining a hold on the northern part of Tangistan. He always professes very friendly feelings towards the Residency, but is a great arms-dealer and importer, like most headmen in a position to participate in the traffic. The ruling family are— Shaikh Ahmad. Shaikh Husain Shaikh ’All Shaikh Muhammad Shaikh ’Abdullah (about 50). (aged 35) (aged 28) (aged 23), (killed 1910).

DAIYIR —Lat. 27° 50' ; Long. 51° 59'. _ A small port on the Dashti coast 9 miles W. of Kangan, 104 miles S.-E. of Bushire: it stands at the edge of the sea with a low range of sandhills behind it: on the E. side is a large date-grove; one mile off shore is an excellent anchorage in a shamdl, 8 or 10 fathoms with muddy bottom. A reef makes landing difficult and inhabitants use the Bardistan cicek 2 miles to E. as a boat harbour. Fort with towers exists. Population135 5,500, including some A1 Nasur Arabs, some Bahrainis and some Jews: but the majority say they are from Bardistan and claim to have come original ly from Kiifa. 'The inhabitants live by agriculture, but they own fishing smacks and half a dozen vessels running to Bahrain and points on the Arab coast. As a port Daivir is the natural outlet of the southern part of the Dashti district, where grain is largely grown, and horses from Sliiraz were formerly embarked here to escape duty. The misfortunes of Kangan (q. v.) have occasionally benefited Daiyir, but it has itself suffered vicissitudes of fortune and was twice burned by the Khan of Gabandi. r J he town is governed bv a son of the present Khan of Dashti, to which it is subordi- nate. Smuggling of arms and ammunition is extensively carried on at this port, as elsewhere along the Gulf, and the presence of a customs post, estab lished in 1904, has done little to check it: the wuc/irhas several times been forced to fly from his post to avoid being murdered. Large date groves lie E. of the village and are visible from the sea. The population of Daiyir is included, in the general abstract in Appendix I under that of the district of Dashti. 161. DALIKl Lat. 29° 26' Long. 51° 19' Elev. 400'. A village and small district of Dashtistan 13 miles N.-N.-E. of Burazjam adjoined by hills on N. E. and surrounded on other sides by date groves. Dates, wheat and barley are grown. Animals have been estimat ed at 40 mules and 40 donkeys. Water is plentiful and drinkable, though slightly brackish from a stream. Oil springs in conjunction with sulphur springs occur in the vicinity. A concession for working them w T as obtained by Messrs. Hotz of Bushire in 1884 : their attempt to find oil was unsuccessful, as also were those of the Persian Mining Rights Corporation in 1895 (?), who sunk a bore to 800 feet. In the plain S. of Dalaki bitumen is collected and used as a cure for the sore backs of camels, and for boat and roof timbers. Some water mills are worked from the stream. The marsh is coveied with reeds in w r hich wild boar are to be found. The pun gent odour of sulphur and oil spreads over the surrounding country for a great distance. Picturesque salt hills of variegated colour and fantastic shape lie behind (he village: goat and ibex exist in them. Daliki is considered one of the hot test places in the country, but Dr. T. F. Odling, M. R, C. S., considered it not unhealthy, though the summer is depressing and enervating for Europeans. . * 1 be population of Daliki is included in that of Dashtistan in the general abstract given in Appendix. I. The district, containing 3 villages only, is bounded on the: — East: by the mountains. , South : by the Buiazjan frontier passing about 3 miles N. of Qaraul Khaneh. Wwt . boundary lies along the Zira border to the west of a narrow strip containing the large date plantations of Sarkavardan and con tinues about f nule to the W. of the Shiir river till it reaches the mountains behind Bibara and Mazara’i.136 North: by the bridge of Daliki: there is nothing but mountains each side of this. Daliki is the property of Nizam-us-Saltaneh, the Khan paying some 8,200 Tuman seach year to Nizam-us-Salianeh, and 500 l ilmdns to Mughis- ud-Dauleh, his Pishkar. Its revenue consists of about 8000 Tumdns from the date gardens and many thousand Tumdns from taxation of caravans, and .the monopoly of the sale of grain to them. The villages of Daliki district are :— Dalaki (with about 400 houses). Sarkavardan (W. of the river); Kaleh-i-Safid. Muhammad Riza Beg, grandfather of the present Khanwas killed^n 1856 at the gate of Bushire : he originally was Kadkhudd of Ziarat in Buraz- •ion Habibullah Beg, his son, was powerless and the district was taken by the Khans of Burazjan. He was in the service of the Khan for some years and then transferred to Daliki as Kaldntar under the Pars Government. After his death, Muhammad Riza Beg ruled as Kaldntar of Dalaki, and was killed at Kamarij by Haidar Khan some 11 years ago, his wife having been a cousin of Haidar Khan. Nur Muhammad Beg succeeded him, and the district was sold by the Shah to the Nizam-us-Saltaneh. Nur Muham mad was later given the title of Khan. He is on terms of enmity with the Khans of Shabankareh, and an ally of Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh of Burazjan. The genealogy of the ruling family is as follows:— Muhammad Riza Beg. Habibullah Beg. Muhammad Riza Beg. Mansur Beg (farms JamTleh in the moun tains). Muhammad Khan. (about 40). / Allah Karam Beg. (about 15). Husain Beg. Fathullah Beg. (about 20). Owing to his close relations, as tenant, with Nizam-us-Sultaneh, Nur Muhammad Khan has succeeded in getting the control of the villages of DawagunI and Banaki on the Khisht plain given to him, and his brother Husain Beg generally resides at Banaki. Thus the Kutal-i-Malu pass is wholly under the control of the Dal-kl Khans. His nephew, Mansur Beg, farmed from Mushar-ud-Dauleh in 1911 the village of Jamileh m the mountains up the Daliki river and district. Extortion of large revenue from caravans is the all-important object of the Khan’s policy. He is considered ill-disposed towards the British.137 162. DARAB or DARABCtIRD—L at. 28° 45'; Long. 54° 37'; Elev. 4.000'. A large village and district of the same name about 150 mile S.-E. 0 f Shiraz. The district extends 5 miles E. and W. and 27 miles N. and S. It is bounded on the N. by Niriz and Istehbanat, on the E. by Mahall-i- Sab’eh, on the S. by Laristan, and the Juyum and Bidshahr district, on the W. by those of Fasii and Jahrum. Products and Commerce. —The district is very fertile : grain yields from 10 to 50 fold in good years : the chief crops are wheat, bailey, millet, maize rice, tobacco, sesame and cotton. Flocks and herds are numerous. Popidation. —Estimated in 1890 at 2,500 families: shown in Appendix I as 10,000 souls exclusive of nomad Baharlu. The hills S. of the plain have no water and are not inhabited. The town has a fine situation on the banks of a river in an extensive plain interspersed with villages and cultivation and is surrounded bv lemon and orange groves. The mountains on the N. part of Kuh-i-Ma’dan form an amphitheatre, the deepest part of which is about 1 mile from the town, which extends towards the two horns of the crescent. Date palms are numerous. The town is less well-built tlian, for example, Fasa. Tlie houses are mainly of mud and stone. The main street is long and straggling, and owing to the .numerous gardens in its vicinity the town appears to cover a lot of ground and to be bigger than it really is. There are estimated to be 1,000 houses and 100 shops : the total population was about 6,000 souls in 1890, but it is understood that it has greatly decreased since then. Lemon and orange trees yield abundant fruit: tobacco is largely grown and sent to Shiraz. Date- palms, apricot, peach, plum, almond and pistachio trees flourish : grape vines grow on the hillsides. On the Kuh-i-Ma’dan, above (he town, copper silver . lr&lt; ^ are said to be found, but none are now worked : gypsum is also Climate The climate is oppressively warm in the plain during the summer • snow ,s rarely seen The weather is on the whole so mild that lemons are found ripening on the trees all the year round.

DASHTISTAN.- A district, natural and physical rather than administrative, on the mainland E. of Bushire : its chief town is Burazjan {q.v.) situated in the centre of the district, of which it is the only market and roughly 28 miles N. E. of Bushire. Boundaries .—The district is 30 miles long from Bibara in the N. to Chah- kutah in the S. and from 10 to 15 miles broad. On the S. it reaches the coast near Bushire: on the W. it is enclosed by the districts of Angali and Zira, and on the N. W. by Mazara’i: on the N. and E. it is bounded by mountains which form nominally part of the Dashti district. To the S. it is bounded by the districts of Chahkutah and Tangistan. Physical characteristics —Dashtistan, as its name denotes, is a plain, slop ing gently towards the sea : the principal stream is the Daliki River, which unites with the Ab-i-Shirin to form the Rudhilleh River. Smaller streams are the Ahmadi River, which rises in the Kuh-i-Bairami and reaches the sea 2 miles E. of Shlf, and the salt stream of Chahkutah, which runs parallel to it a few miles S. E. Climate.—Vide “ Dashti,” the climate of which district is much the same as that of Dashtistan : it is hotter and dryer, but healthier than that of Bushire. The climate of Daliki is worse than that of the rest of the district owing to its situation close to marshes and under the hills. Traces of sulphur, bitumen and petroleum occur at the end of the district near Daliki {q.v.). Water is obtained nearly everywhere from wells 30' to 50' deep, with 4' to 10' of water : they never fail.142 Population .—Mixed : about 15,000 souls, mainly immigrants from Daslitl and from the direction of Shiraz. Deserving of special mention are the Persian tribes of Bag, or Beg, living in Jimeh, Khushab and Khushmakan, in the centre of the district. They were originally masters of Burazjan, but have now sunk to the level of ordinary cultivators, having been expelled by the Paparis two generations ago. The Papari and Qaidan are noticed in the article on Burazjan. A few Zanganehs or Zanguis are found, particu larly at Chahkutah. This is a tribe of uncertain origin, but reputed to be courageous: it is in great strength near Kirmanshah and a tribe of the same name is found in the Bakhtiari country. There are also a number of Arab settlements, of which the most important is a group in the S. E. comer of the district, of which Chahkutah is the largest: it will be noted that m this Gazetteer Chahkutah has been treated as a separate district as, indeed,^ it is in practice. Other Arabs, said to be from Bahrain, are found N. of Buraz jan and Arabs believed to have come from Hindian occur at a few scattered points With the exception of the Damukh, who are a section of the Dawasir of Bahrain, and a few of the other Arabs, the whole population is Persian speaking and Shi’ah. .. . Except in Burazjan the dwellings of the inhabitants are nearly all huts. The inhabitants of Dashtistan were described more than two decades ago as very vicious and very warlike. Agriculture—The chief staples of Dpshtistan are wheat and barley, which are grown in summer, and dates. In summer water-melons, musk-melons, cucumbers, maize, cotton, castor-oil, beans, onions, garlic and sesame are cultivated by irrigation from wells. Livestock is represented by an ordinary proportion of cattle, sheep and goats. The unit of land-measurement is the Gdu or that area of land which requires 6 Hashim mans of seed grain and can be ploughed by one yoke of animals (whether cattle, horses mules or donkeys) in a single day; it is said to be represented by a square of which the side is 250 yards. In a good year the return to cultivation m Dashtistan is from 8 to i6-fold. Dashtistan agriculturally resembles Dashti, but it is considered the superior district. The cultivators of Dashtistan are many of them embarrassed with debts originating in loans taken at exorbitant rates of interest for the purpose of buying seed-grain. Trade .—Burazjan is the commercial centre of Dashtistan and the article on it may be consulted for an account of the trade of the district. The standard of weight is not undorm throughout the district, but varies from 16 to 20 Tabriz mans of Bushire, being 18 at the important centres of Buraz jan and Chahkutah. . ^ 1 Communications and transpcrt.-The district contains no natural obstacles. Within it lie the first three stages on the ordinary route from Bushire to Shiraz. The transport resources of the district are estimated at -00 horses some camels, 350 mules and 2,500 donkeys. Some quantity of wheat and barley is purchasable locally, but not as a rule until t e prospec s o le coming harvest are assured ; until this occurs the stocks m hand arc hoarded. Administration—In the middle of the eighteenth century much of Dash tistan was under the power of Shaikh Nas&lt;r who ruled in us ire, an e history of the province seems to have followed more or less the fortunes143 of that town. In 1888 Dashtistan was placed bv the Amin-us-SuItan under Shaikh Nasir, but later was given to the Governor-General of Shiraz, and administered by a sartip acting as his deputy. The political organisation of Dashtistan is a patchwork of marvellous complexity. The bulk of the district is under the Governor-General of Ears, but some of the southern villages, including the group for which the Shaikh of Chahkutah is respon sible, are, on occasions, subordinate to the Governor of the Gulf Ports. The system of farming the revenues is responsible for further confusion, es pecially as a certain degree of executive power is always conferred on the ‘farmer ’ along with the right to collect the taxes, and the more so in the present case as the farmer of the greater part of Dashtistan is not infre quently the Governor of the Gulf Ports, who leases it from the Governor- General of Ears. Nor is the administration of the Governor commonlv direct, whether he be actual or titular. Half or more of the villages to the N. of Buraijan are held, as a tiul or fief, by the Nizam-us-Sultaneh. Burazjan and its dependent villages, forming the greater part of the district, are ruled by the Papari Khan of Burazjan, who also collects the revenues, a privilege for which he pays 5,000 tumans annually ; he is properly answerable to the Governor-General of Pars, to whose jurisdiction he nominally belongs, but in consequence of the farm in favour of the Governor of the Gulf Ports' to which we have alluded, the relations of the Shaikh are usually exclusively with the Bushire Government. The Shaikh of Chahkutah, who is in execu tive charge of that place and of several adjoining villages, is subject both in theory and in practice to the Governor of the Gulf Ports. With the ex ception of a Deputy Governor and a telegraph official at Burazjan, who looks after the Persian Government’s telegraph to Bandar Rig and beyond, Dash- tistan contains no salaried employ &amp; of the Persian Government/ The lot of the subjects of the Khan of Burazjan is not a happy one ; thev are rack rented and obliged to yield their master military service, when ever he may require it, supplying their own arms and ammunition. The subjects of the Shaikh of Chahkutah are probably little better off, and of late years there has been a good deal of emigration from the district. The nominal land-revenue averages 50 to 60 krdns per Gad, but the Khan of Burazjan, at least endeavours to extort more. The total revenue of the Dashtistan district is said to amount to 10,000 krdns, or Rs 2 500 S °1 vl ™ mlnal j usti&lt; J e . and civil justice is syhonvmous with the good offices of Mullas in arranging private disputes. Quarrels between villages are either adjusted by Saiyids or else fought out to the bitter end The antecedents and ition of the Kh - ns of Buriuj - n an(J Ch - hkat - h are described in the articles on those places.

This range is successive ly called Bairami, Haji, Ahmad!, and Kartang, the part on the left bank of the Mund being known as Kuh-i-Nimak. This latter contains excellent white rocksalt, in small quantities, and sulphur : it is very bare, and the only vegetation on it is the wild almond bush. (2) The broad Dashti plain, generally barren in the centre, but relievsd with frequent patches of cultivation and many date groves at the foot of the hills on either side. It is watered practically only by wells, the water from which is brackish more often than not. (3) The Mund range of soft sandstone and debris of gypsum, separating the Dashti plain from the sea. (4) The coastal strip, with many villages, date groves and cultivation ; water from wells only. (5) The low sandstone hills known as Kuh-i-KhakI between Khurmuj and Sana. The excellent maps of the district now extant make it unnecessary to describe the district further. Coast. —This has not been fully explored— but is fairly well-known. The Nakhllu Island is noteworthy as also the Ttas-al-Mutaf shoal {q.v.). Climate. —Hot but drier than Bushire and more healthy, even on the coast. Population. —About 20,000 souls are estimated to reside permanently in the district. Tribes. —For practical purposes, tribal divisions have now disappeared and all alike are known as Dashtls : the bulk of the present inhabitants are of Arab origin, but have become 1'ersianized. Arab immigrants from Shlbkuh and elsewhere are still to be found : they are for the most part bilingual Sunnis. The Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908, gives the following list of the better known tribes of the district:— Name, No. of soule.

Sadat 600 Salih Ahmadis 150 The Khans of the dynasty preceding the present one were of this tribe, but Jamal Khan and his relations speak of themselves as belonging to it, and say that it is an off-shoot of the Haiiha. C361GSB u149 Most of these tribes are of Arab descent but are now. almost without exception, Shi’ahs, speaking Persian only. Besides the above, there are a number of small and obscure tribes, including the Dabashiha, Dehdarha, Kangani, Khannasiri, Muhalli, Qaidan, Shaikhani, Shaikha, Tangasiri, ’Umruha, Mashaikh and Tamimi: at some coast villages will be found colo nies of Arab immigrants of fairly recent date : these are mostly bilingual and Sunnis. The population includes a number of kakasldh, descendants of imported negro slaves. Characteristics. —The Dashtis are more peaceably inclined than their neighbours the Tangistanis, being partially civilized and in some degree amenable to management. The principal men have stone houses : the rest live in mud houses, mat huts or huts made of reeds and date leaves. Most villages are defended by bur} of mud or stone. The population, with a few exceptions, is entirely agricultural, combining with this profession, on the coast, that of sailor and fisherman as well as smuggler whenever opportunity offers. They now seem to be not less well armed than their neighbours, whether in the other coastal districts or inland. 1 heir rifles are mainly English and German magazine rifles, and a number of Martinis. All magazine rifles, or rifles taking a nickel bullet, are known by them as ‘‘ Almani.” Dashtis are healthy, sturdy men and many of the labourers and boatmen in Bushire are drawn from this district. Agriculture and Trade. —The chief crops are wheat, barley and dates : the date trees, which are generally watered from wells, are of a variety requiring less water than those of the Shatt-al- Arab. Lemons, melons, and vege tables are also grown in small quantities for local use. It may be assumed that every village in Dashti grows the crops mentioned above, unless the contrary is stated in the case of any particular village. The water-lift used is called “ charkheh-i-chhahdb ” and is worked by a bullock descending an inclined cutting in the ground. Cattle, sheep and goats are numeious, as also camels and donkeys. Trade on a small scale is general, but there is nowhere in the district any large bazaar or mercantile centre. The exports of the district are cattle, ghi, wheat, barlev, dates (m very small quantities), onions, (?) firewood, charcoal, earthenware and a few 'aba&lt; of local make. The krdn is current as well as the rupee in some coast villages. The lo.‘al man is nib. 13 oz., the//as/mn man being equal to 1G local mans: these are standard weight. Daiyir and Lavar are the chief ports. Communications. —The routes in common use are :— (1) along the coast from Chaghadak through Tangistan to Daiyir and beyond. This is not passable for pack animals without difficulty beyond Karri, owing to creeks and the Mund River, which is un- fordable at its mouth. (2) down the Khurmuj valley (E. side) at the foot of Kuh-i-Bairam fiom Ahram to J.avar and thence in various directions (3) down the Khurmuj valley (W. side). (\) from Darwlshan to Baghan, RIz and Jam. (5) from Darvishan to Pas Rudak and the Dizgah plain.ino Tlie maritime plain is pierced in PashtI by three passes only, the Parreh Gall, Darreh Mishi and the Tang-i-Sehdar ; all three passes unite at Sar-i- Gach and lead to Tahluk and Kalimeh. Administration .—The Dashti district belongs to Fats, but it is sometimes farmed from the Governor General by the Governor of the Gulf Ports. It is administered by a hereditary Khan, of Arab descent, who has his residence at Khurmuj and became master of the district after numerous smaller Shaiklis or Khans had reduced themselves to impotence by their internecine feuds. The Khan pays (according to the statement of Jamal Khan to Lieutenant Wilson in 1911) 10,500 T. asl and 500 T. “ haq-i-huhlmat ” annually for the district to whoever has the farm for the time being (the Persian Gulf Gazet teer gives the sum payable as 16,000 T.). The Khan is responsible for law and order : village headmen and his personal retainers are his deputies for the purpose. Land revenue is 10-20 krans a gdu (250 yards x 250 yards) but according to the P. G. G. 50 krans : the date palm tax is now only 2 krans for three trees, but according to the P. G. G. | to 2 krans. The poll-tax given by the P. G. G as 5 to 20 krans no longer exists. The population, owing to several years of scarcity and general disorder, appears to have diminished of recent years. The present Khan is Jamal Khan (65). son of Haidar Khan, son of HajI Khan, son of Jamal Khan. Muhammad Khan, uncle of the present Khan, who succeeded Haidar Khan on the latter’s death at Shiraz in 1880, died in June 1882 at Bushire, where he was in close imprisonment for arrears of revenue. For the last 15 years the Khan has farmed and administered several of the Slubkiili ports, which are properly speaking outside the district including Daiyir and Kangan. For these he paid, according to the P. G. G., 800 T. yearly, but according to local report 4,000 T. The district is traversed by Route 31. The following is a list of some of the villages of the district, arranged in alphabetical order : it is believed that the list is almost complete :— Name, Lat, Long. No. of houses. Notes. •Abdan ..

A plain, on both banks of the Miind River, containing several villages details of which are given below :— It is nominally in the Galehdar district, but since its purchase some 12 years ago, for 10,000 T., from the Crown by the late Zargham-ud-Dauleh, Qashqai, it has been administered by the Qashqai chiefs, and is therefore separately described. It takes its name from the number of large mounds, some of them with ruins on the top, which are dotted about the plain, and which are known as “ Diz ” : it is also vulgarly known as Duzdgah, but was correctly named by Commander Felix Jones, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf in 1856. It can be reached from Jam, (1) direct (2) via Dad-ul-Mizan, (3) via Riz In each case two short stages by execrable tracks : the last route is the easiest. In this plain the principal branches of the Mund River (q.v.) converge. The valley is a place of some strategic value owing to the numerous tracks that diverge from the plain in all directions. Supplies of corn, barley and straw sufficient for a regiment of cavalry for a month, if not more. The following villages occur in the plain :— Name. No. of houses. Notes.

Qashqais camp in the plain, which is plentifully sprinkled with A:wwar trees. The estimated population of the district is 2,000 souls. 166. DIZKURD.—Lat. 30 46; Long. 52 4; Elev. 6,800'. A village and small hilly district of the same name, bounded on the N. by Shish Dangeh, on the E. by Ohehar Dangeh, on the S. by Kam Firuz and on _the W by the Mamassani and Kuhgalu country. x2159 It is about midway between Asupas and Kuh-i-DIna according to Durand, who states that it is inhabited by Circassians (Charkas) and that the revenues are payable to the Qashqai. The district includes the following places or villages :— Bukar. Mand. Charkaa. Shahidan. Chashmeh. Deh HajI Bihruz. Kufteh, Laili, Kuh-i- Sharqi. Sucha (Lat. 30° 46'; Long. 52° G'). Tang-i-Rakbaq. Zinian. The estimated population is 500. FARRASHBAND.—Lat. 28° 50'; Long. 52° 7'; Elev. 2,400'. 167. A large village and district 30 miles W. of Firiizabad : the village is surrounded by palm groves and lies in a plain of the same name, 30 miles long by 4 miles broad. The village has a fort and 800 huts ; the plain is well- cultivated; but by rainfall only: wheat and barley alone are grown the yield is said to vary from 10 or 12 fold in the case of old ground to 30 or 40 fold in the case of virgin soil. There are five or six villages in the plain, of which details are given below so far as they are available. Boundaries .—The district is bounded on the N. by Kuhmarreh, on the E. by Firiizabad, on the S. W. by Dashti, on the N. W. by Jirreh and on the S. by Mahall-i-Arba’eh. Supplies. Meat, fodder and provisions generally obtainable in considerable quantities, particularly when the nomads are in the vicinity. Grazing good. Water rather scarce, but available from springs in the surrounding hills. A road branches off from Farrashband to Shiraz via Girl : it was by this track that the Persians brought down 12-pr. guns in the war of 1856. The estimated population of the district is 2,000.

The district is bounded on the N. by Sarvistan, on the E. by Istehbanat, on the S. by Darab and Jahrum, on the W. by Khafr. It extends E. and W. 45 miles, N. and S. from 9 to 15 miles. The population of the district is estimated at 13,000 exclusive of the town, which may be put at 4,000. Products and Commerce .—The district produces tobacco, opium, sesame, com, rice, dates and every kind of fruit. The principal trade is in opium and tobacco which are sent to Shiraz. The Fasa opium is as good as any produced in Persia and fetches a high price in the market: exports vary from 300 to 6,000 Tabriz mans a year. There is a little earthenware made locally, and a variety of chldar is weaved in the town and sold in Shiraz and elsewheie, but with this exception agriculture is the sole occupation of theI6l |T bulk of the inhabitants of the district. Fasa is notable for its mild climate : the date does not bear fruit N. of the town and it is said that only in Fasa can ripe dates, snow from the mountains and various garden fruits such as grapes, pomegranates, etc., be placed on the table simultaneously. The town is fairly well built and there are several gardens with summer houses on the outskirts. The kaldntars of the town in 1911 were Muhammad Hasan and Mirza Hasan ’Ali. The mdl ydt of the own is about 70,000 brans a year, that of the district about 200,000 krdns. Most of the villages belong to the Qawamis or to their adherents. There is a P. O. with a weekly post to Shiraz, and occasionally to Jahrum. The following villages are included in the district Name. Lat. Long. Notes. O / O / Akbaraba 1 .. 28 56 53 56 4]s miles from Fasa.

It is surrounded by a mud wall and ditch and there are a few plantations of date trees round it. It contains some 200 houses : on the outskirts of the town is a large walled house, the residence of the Ilkhdni of the Qashqai tribe, who is the ex-officio governor of Firuzabad and Far- rashband. dhe town^ though walled, is incapable of offering any resistance to an army and is commanded by a low range of hills on the east side. The inhabitants are for the most part engaged in fruit-farming and cultivation ; there are also a few carpet-makers. The people are civil and disposed to be friendly. hlruzabad is the best place along the route to Niriz from Bushire via Jah- rum. Its chief importance from a military point of view is that it is admirably suited for a halting place and a supply depot. The estimated population of the town is 4,000, of the district 3,000. Climate.—Tbis district enjoys a moderate climate and is generally healthy. The heat is never excessive. Colonel Taylor recommended it as being in every way eligible for a cantonment. Surrounding country—The whole of the plain around the town is extremely fertile, and, for Persia, well inhabited. It bears the same name as the town and is elevated, well watered and bears rich wheat and famous rice. It is one of the best corn-producing and grazing districts in Persia. For the most part it is 7 miles wide, but at the south-eastern extremity narrows to 5 miles. Here it only produces grass and has a rocky mountain ridge on either hand, that on the N.-E. rising to 2,000 feet. It had 30 villages about 50 years ago—but the number is now reduced to about 13. It is watered by the Firuzabad river, which has its source in the Dashti-i-Muk and enters and leaves the plain by great gorges, the last of which has perpendicular cliffs, 500 feet high : it then joins its waters with those of the Kara-i-Aghach and flows into the Mund river {q.v.). Irade, Resources, Transport and Supplies .—Supplies plentiful. Rice, gram and barley are exported into the surrounding country and fruits and rose water to Bushire. The total value of exports does not exceed Rs. 4,000 annually. There are about 50 horses and a few ponies in the town, and some thousands of donkeys could be collected, as large numbers are employed on the caravan routes. Mules are very rarely seen in these parts. There is excellent camping ground for a very large force here, and an abundant supply of good water for both men and animals. Firewood in large quantities could be obtained from Maimand, where there is stated to be any amount of wood of all sorts. History —Near the town, about 4 miles to the N.-W.. are some ruins known as old Flriizabad or Kaleh Firuzabad, evidently once a considerable town and surrounded by a ditch and embankment, the former 40 to 50 paces in width, forming a wide circle nearly a mile in diameter. The original town was built by the Achsemenian, and subsequently embellished by the Sas- sanian monarchs, and bore the name of Jur, Giir or Khur. The name hiruzabad,” or the “ Abode of Victonq” was subsequently given to it by C361GSB ' v165 the Asad-ud-Dauleh of the Buieh dynasty in the tenth century. Here Ardashir Babakan built a palace and a great Atish-Gah or fire temple. The remains now visible are briefly : (1) The Kaleh-i-Dukhtar, a ruined castle upon the heights command ing the Tang Ab, a defile to the north of the town. (2) Two Sassanian bas-reliefs sculped on the walls of the same defile. (3) The ruins of a great vaulted building, generally recognized as the palace of Ardashir. (4) A ruined tower, pillar or obelisk of unhewn 'masonry, commonly identified with the Atish-Gah of Ardashir, though Perrot attributes to it a secular or military origin. It is 12 feet square and 60 feet high, and farms a conspicuous landmark all over the plain It retains traces of an outside winding ascent from terrace to terrace, like the Babylonian temples. (o) The remains of two tanks also supposed to have belonged to the Gabrs, or fire-worshippers. These are now the only remains of the former race. Legend says that n, GX p Ica ^ b u rtt a dam at the gorge of the southern end of the plain, -£,~ U f ^ C i ^ a!n anc ^ destroying old Firuzabad. In a latter generation iiruz ohah broke the dam, drained the plain and founded the modern town, on which he bestowed his own name. The terms upon which land is held in the district from the IWinnl of the gashqais used to be as followsLand which is his private property is culti- at h !

He contrived to remove the water of the place, by making an opening for the water to flow away, and built on that spot Gur.” F (For further descriptions see Durand.) In short the town would seem to have been built by Ardashir Babakan, the founder of the Sassanian dynasty, on the site of an older town, Gur, and its name changed to Ardashir Khuirih, or “the glory of Ardashir.” In the 10th century it was taken by Asad-ud-Dauleh, who was of the Dilamite dynasty, which held the mastery in Fars in the 10th and part of the 11th centuries. I he name then became Firuzabad at the dictates of its new master. The following villages and places occur in the district:— Name. &lt; Lati tude. Longi tude.

A town in the S -E. corner of Ears proper, 8 miles inland as th° crow flies, midway between Tahiri and Naband. It is the headquarters of a dis trict of the same name. It was formerly under Laristan, but it is now direct ly under the Governor-General of Ears at Shiraz; the headman in 1911 was ’All Akbar Khan, not to be confused with a man of the same name at Jam. The town, or rather village, lies on the S. side of an open valley, at the foot of Kuh-i-Haft. There is a fort, 200' houses, mostly of stone, and the population was estimated by Butcher in 1889 at 700. Grazing^ good, fuel plentiful: barley, wheat, gram and tobacco are cultivated. A small bazaar exists which is patronized by villagers for 50 miles round. The town and district are under the influence of SauIat-ud-Dauleh, but do not pay revenue through him. Tracks diverge to Tahiri, 25 miles, via Tang-i-Bidu: to Lingeh via Ishkanu ; to ’Alamarvdasht and to Pas Rudak via Dad-ul-MIzan, via the Rah-i-Malushtar. A great part of the district is known as “ Nahiyeh-i-Fal,” and in it are includ ed all the villages mentioned below, but Jam and villages subordinate thereto and the villages of the Dizgah plain, which are included in the Fal district according to the Farsnameh, are made the subject of separate notes in this Gazetteer. The estimated population of the district, with the above exceptions, is 4,500. * • 6# Name. Lati tude. Longi tude. Notes. ft &lt; Aqaha o t.

It is bounded on the — West .—By the sea from the Kuh-i-Bang hills as far as the outflow of Sur-i-Bidu to the sea. South .—By the Sur-i-Bldu, to its rise in the Mahur-i-Haiat Baud behind Chahar Rustai, separating Haiat Baud first from the Rudhilleh district, afterwards from Shabankareh. East .—Haiat Baud territory extends 15 miles into the mountains from the coast range, and marches with Kashkuli and Qashqai tribal country of Mahur-i-Mllati and Khisht, but it has no vil lages in the hills, which are only used for pasture. A orth .—From the middle of the Kuh-i-Bang hills, N. of the village of Bang, across the narrow valley to their E., and N. of the village of Shul to the coast range, then across the mountains for some 15 miles. It is separated from the Lirawi district by the Khur Shirlnak stream which enters the sea near Sabz Pushan. In the political territory of Haiat Baud are also {i) the port, and village of Bandar Bilam, with about 1 mile square each side of it, and («) the islands of Kharg and Khargu, about 25 miles from the mainland off Rudhil leh. The district of Rudhilleh (q.v.) was until some 15 years ago entirely sepa rate from Haiat Baud and then belonged to a certain Muhammad Khan : its present connection occurs from the fact that its resident Khans since then have been members of the Haiat Baud family, who defeated and drove out the last owners. The present chief of Haiat Baud lived, during his father’s life-time, for some years at Mahmadi in charge of the district after his succession, the third brother Hussain Qull Khan took over charge. As the family’s interests are much bound up and all pay allegiance to the eldest brother at Bandar Rig, the districts should be taken together. Physical Geography.—The district is a plain, cut up by water-courses, some of them of considerable size. Close to Rig there is an outcrop of light grey sandstone. The principal creeks of the district are Khur Qusair, frequent ed by large boats, between Rig and the Rudhilleh river, and Khur Khalil, a tidal inlet 1 mile S. of Ganaweh, and used by the boat-owners of that place. Population. Mostly Liirs from Behbehan, submerging an ancient Persian population, whom local tradition represents as having continued to beGabrs or fireworshippers till about 500 years ago. In some places there is an infusion of Arab blood, and the village of Gumarun {qv.) is a settlement of Saiyids. The total population is about 12.000, all Shi ahs. Persian is universally spoken. Inland the people are cultivators, but on the coast they combine agriculture with fishing and a certain amount of smuggling. Huts are the only kmd of dwelling outside Bandar Rig. The inhabitants are generally peaceable and partially civilized, but are well armed. From January to April, the population is swollen by Barashuri and Kashkuli nomads, w ho camp near Rig and make their purchases for the year.171 Trade .—The subject of trade is disposed of in the article on Bandar Rig, through which all the external trade of the district passes. The inter nal trade is of no account. Transport and communications .—The district, it is believed, apart from the town of Bandar Rig, can furnish about 350 horses, 250 camels, 150 mules and 2,000 donkeys. There appear to be no serious obstacles to the move ment of transport. It is possible to march along the coast, and the inland route from Burazjan to Zaidan (No. 54) traverses the district via the villages of Chehar Rustai, Gah Safid, ’AbbasI, Mahmad Sadi and Bahmiari : there is also a route from Bandar Rig to Deh Kuhneh in the Shabankareh district and thence to Burazjan (Route 55). Haidar Khan Administration .—The district is governed by a hereditary Khan of Lur descent, who has his residence at Bandar R'gand is subject to the governor of the Gulf Ports. At present he pays 8,000 twndns yearly for the farm of the district. Criminal justice is dispensed by this Khan and by one of his brothers who acts as his deputv at Chehar Rustai. Docu ments are attested and civil disputes are settled in every village by the local KazI or Mulla, except matrimonial cases which it is usual to refer to the Kazi or Mulla of the neighbouring village. The general administration is conducted through the headmen of the villages, who in this district are termed Qaids. There are no regular police, but the retainers of the Khan rnn t0 -n V s _ afet ^ of the roa ds. Land revenue is collected at rate of 00 or iO krans per gau of cultivation : there are no other taxes.

One of the most important villages is Sfll, between the Kuh-i-Bang mountains and the coast-range, and on the borders of Lirawi. History .—The district abounds in ruins and traces of an extremely ancient civilization, which have not yet (1905) been investigated, and there is much * mention in local traditions of fire-worship surviving to a comparatively recent period. The bricks found at some of the old sites are said to resemble those of Ctesiphon. A century ago the town of Bandar Rig was in the possession of a family of the Zab tribe, who are now found chiefly in Tmcial Oman : another account says that the Mir tribe, under Mir Muhanna, were in possession of the town. According to this version the Mirs came from Hindian and drove the Persian officials from Bandar Rig, and, at a later date, the Dutch from their settlement on Kharag island. There are said to be descendants of Mir Muhanna at Kuwait. The leader of Zab is said to have been Mir Mahran, who was killed in a piratical expedition against Basrah: the tribe consequently lost their hold on the place, and were succeeded by a family of Lurs whose founder had been a follower of Mir Muhanna. These maintained their position until about 1870 when the father of the present Khan of Bandar Rig, who was already Khan of the Haiat Da fid district, succeeded in removing the Bandar Rig Khan of that day, the grandson of the first Lur Khan, by treacherously throwing him down a well at Arash, which he then caused to be filled up. He then incorporated the Khanate of the town with his own rural Khanate. Khan ’Ali Khan, who died about 15 years ago, was continually in trouble with the Governor of the Gulf Ports, and, in consequence of his turbulence and arrears, his two eldest sons Haidar Khan and Muhammad Khan were in their boyhood brought up in Bushire, as hostages for their father’s conduct. Khan ’Ali Khan was constantly fighting and generally victorious over Haji Hasan Khan of Liiawi, the district immediately N. of the Kuh-i-Bang. After his death his sons divided their spheres of influence as follows:— Haidar Khan took Bandar Rig. Husain Quli Khan took the district of Rudhilleh. Muhammad Khan took Chahar Rustai and acts as commander of the forces of the district. Further, after the death of Murad Khan, brother of Khan ’All, the ports of Bandar Dilam and Ganaweh were by family arrangement entrusted to his son, Husain Khan, and the latter’s sons. The strength of the district and Khans lies, however, in the unity of con trol, for all are obedient to the eldest brother, Haidar Khan, whose word is law in the district. Their wealth and successful business in smuggling has perhaps added to their power in former years. Moreover by his sister’s marriage to Agha Khan, third son of Haji Hasan Khan of Lirawi, and other marriage ties, besides the lessons of several de feats, Haidar Khan has acquired a ruling voice in the policy of the Khans C361GSB z173 of Lirawi, and their district. Lirawl to day is practically part and parcel of Haiat Daud. Haidar Khan, who is not a fighting Khan, wields influence, by his sagacity and powerful position, over the Khans of Shabankareh and Angall as well, while he enjoys cordial relations with the Kashkuli Khans, his neigh bours across the mountains. The Khans for many years have been almost independent of the Cen'ral and Provincial Governments : the Governor of the Gulf Ports never meddles with the districts, nor sends soldiers or officials there, and it would be be yond his power at the present time to dismiss or change the Khans. Their relations with British officials and tradres have been very friendly for some years. Armed forces .—The armed forces at the disposal of Haidar Khan are estimated at 1,500 to 2,000 tufanjchls in normal times. In May 1909 Hai dar Khan despatched some 400 armed men to Bushire to assist the Daria Beg! in his expedition to Tangistan. Haidar Khan can also dispose of the armed forces of Bud Hilleh, some 700 tufangchis, as well as contingents from Ganaweh and Lirawl, numbers unknown. Haidar Khan afforded courageous personal assistance to the British Resident, and “H.M.S. Highflyer,” in arresting pirates at Ganaweh in 1908. The districts of Haiat Daud and Rudhilleh have for many years enjoyed the greatest tranquillity. The genealogical tree of the present Khan of Haiat Daud is as follows:— Murad Khan (of Uai&amp;t Daud). I Husain Khan. Khan ’Ali Khan (born about 1841) marriod a daughter of the Shaikhs of Bushire, died about 1890 : ruled 45 years. Haidar Khan.

A town and district, 90 miles S,F, oi SKira Z , 3 ituatea in an extensive plain of the same name under the N. slope of kuh-.-Alburd ; of the vails of the town practically nothing now remains; access can only be obtained by the gates of the town, of which there are about 6, connected with each other by thin garden walls, or the backs of houses. Many of the houses possess turrets, which are used for the faction fights prevalent n the town The number of houses is about 2,000 ; the town is completely siu-rounded by date plantations which make it app^r larger than it really is. There is only one large sarai, at the S.-W. of the town , it would hold | squadron. ^ The population of the town was estimated,in 1893 at 10,000, by Lt Wilson in 1911 at 5,000, exclusive of the district, 2,500. The principal produce of the district is tobacco, which goes principally to Shiraz. The land round Jahrum is for the most part irrigated with water drawn by bullocks from wells ; the plain is everywhere dotted with these wells many of which are brackish. There is good running water 2 miles E. of the town, supplying large gardens. There is a post weekly to Shiraz, and occasionally to Lar. Fruit is ex tensively grown for local consumption ; raisins are exported and some times dates. Malikls (Persian cloth shoes) are largely manufactured and sent for sale to Shiraz. Few mules or ponies are available, but plenty of donkeys The people are as unpleasant and unmannerly as are to be found in any town of S.-W. Persia. There is no Persian garrison; the town is managed by one or more Mdntars, who are responsible for the revenue ; a deputy governor seldom makes his appearance and is never, even when present, in a position to enforce his authority. Some 15 miles to the E. of the town is the Baharlu fort of Kalat-i-Tawar, a hill fort, fonnerly garrisoned by 100 Persian soldiers, but now in the hands of the Baharlu. Name. Lat. Long. Notes.

A village of Ears 20 miles by road due N. of Tahiri, and situated nominally in the Galehdar district : it is situated in the centre of a stony valley, sparsely wooded with kmar bush, with a length S.-E. and N.-W. of 12 miles, and a breadth of not more than 6 miles. To the south runs the rocky Kuchur range, which terminates to the east in a bluff known as Puzeh Padri, visible from ships off Tahiri. Viewed from the S.- E. the hill is seen end on, and looks like a truncated pyramid- Mr. Butcher, who ascended it in 1888, estimated its height at 1.500 feet above Jam. At its foot stands the village of Padri, with a few date trees, and the ruins of several dams, and some old houses. White men.-presumably C3G1GSB 24181 Portuguese, are said to have lived in the latter, which lie along the steep slopes of the ridge. The summit has an area of 400 by 200 yards, with a steep drop of 350 to 500 feet to the S.-E., and S.-E. The ascent from the N.-E. is precipitous, but practicable for mules. The hill is bare and devoid of shrubs or grass. This hill must not be confused with Sir-i- ’Aianat (“ Barn Hill” of the Charts) which is Kuh-i-Mara Kishti. The valley is watered, except in winter, not by surface streams but qandts ; the water is of excellent quality. Population. —About 1,500 in 200 houses or huts ; in the village the huts are mainly of stone. All alike are Persians, indigenous to the district. Administration. —Jam, alojig with Dizgah (q.v.) and ’Alamarvdasht, was bought by the Zargham-ud-Dauleh Qashqai from the Crown some years ago and on the Z rgham’s death came in to the hands of Saulat-ud-Dau’eh, whose property it now is ; for practical purposes it no longer forms part of the Galehdar district, and is therefore noted on separately. The present Kaldntar is “ Haji Khan” (’Ali Akbar) aged about 40. Mdliydt, all included, 1,500 Tumdns. Products. —Wheat, barley, dates, tobacco, fruit; the last being exported to Tahiri in season ; firewood is also brought down to the coast and shipped to the Arab coast. Communications. —The only track to the sea coast in regular use is the old road to lahiri via Puzeh PadrI: a very bad track, only fit for donkeys. There is also a track to Bushire via Biz fit for mules. Climate very hot in summer; the valley is quite unsuitable for a health resort on this account. The following villages are subordinate to Jam, though nominally in the Galehdar district :—- Name. Arbanuneh, Bagh-i- . Bld-i-Buland Bld-i-Khar .. Bid-i-Qibleh Bid-i-Sarhadd Chaheh ., Lat. Long.

Water is plentiful in the Shahpur river, though slightly brackish. The wells near the village run dry in summer. Supplies of barley, bhusa and sheep sufficient for a brigade are obtainable. Flour has to be brought from the mills in the Shahpur valley. Grazing is scanty. Fuel from the wild almond bush is good and plentiful. ♦ The principal portion of the Kamarij district consists of a level plain stretching from a little beyond the top of the Kutal-i-Kamarij to the south ern end of the Tang-i-Turkan, and measuring some 4 miles by 3 miles. But the actual boundaries at present are on the:—- North :—the southern end of the Tang-i-Turkan. South :—the village of Charum on the banks of the Shahpur river, beyond the foot of the Kamarij Kutal. East :—the mountains Kuh-i-Mast and Kuh-i-Gunjishk, which separate the district from the Kazarun plain. West :—the river Shahpur at Rudak, which belong to Kamarij. Only 5 villages are in the district:— Kamarij (about 150 houses inhabited). Rudak. Banaft. Chirhan 9 miles beyond Kamarij on the road to Bushire, on left bank of Shahpur river : a tower. Caravansarai (Deh Kuhneh). It formerly was part of the Sub-Government of Khisht, but is now owned by Mushir-ud-Dauleh, to whom the revenue is paid. Qashqai clans are neighbours to the district on 3 sides: the Kashkull and Chehar Banicheh tribes outside the further extremity of the Tang-i-Turkan and near Bushakan: the Farsimaidan about 4 miles on the further side of the Kuh-i-Mast: the Kashkull again about 7 miles to the west of Rudak. There are two alternative routes between Kazarun, Kamarij and Kunar Takhteh. One the Rah-i-Bardun over the Kuh-i-Mast is often used by Kamarijis, for caravans t&gt;p Kazarun, when at strife with the Kashkulis. The other route from Kazarun leaves the main track at the caravansarai and passes by the Kuh-i-Surkh road to the north of Kamarij till it descends on to the Kunar Takhteh plain, thus avoiding the Tang-i-Turkan, Kamarij, and the Kutal-i-Kamarij altogther. ^ About 1905, in the time of Haidar Khan, its late chief, the district of Kamarij was more important than to-day. Haidar Khan, by force of arms, obtained unlimited control from the top of the Kutal-i-Malu to Kazarun, where he established himself as Deputy-Governor and turned out and defeated186 Khwajeh Ibrahim, Kalantar of Kazarun. Haidar Khan died of wounds inflicted by a slave, at Kazarun in September 1909, leaving an infant son, Farajullah Khan, in the guardianship of a black confidant, Khurslud. The latter possessed considerable talents and great bravery ; he had to repel attacks by a brother of the late Haidar Khan and constant aggression from men whom he had outlawed from Kamarij, including the well-known ’Ali Muhammad. The Kashkulis are bitter enemies of his and covet the district. In the spring of 1911 Nizam-us-Saltaneh determined to attack Kamarij, urged on by Saulat-ud-Dauleh: several hundred Qashqais, with other partisans of Nizam bombarded the village and Khurshid, after shut ting himself up in the Khan’s fort, on which many of his own villagers fired, escaped to the Kuh-i-Mast. He was gradually joined by his adherents, and returned in June '911 to Kamarij, when he destroyed most of the houses in the village to pre\ent the inhabitants opposing him again. He made a great show of ruling not in his own right, but on behalf of Farajullah Khan. He was on friendly t rms with the A'aZdntar of Kazarun, Khw 7 ajeh Abdullah Nasir-ud-DIwan, bi. not very w 7 ell disposed towards Husain Beg of Daliki. The outstanding feature of Khurshid’s politics was enmity with the Qashqais. The Tang-i-Turkan is a no-man’s land, neither Qashqais nor Kamarijis venturing beyond their respective ends. Khurshid was accidentally killed in 1912. Previous rulers of Kamarij were:— Mulla Hcasan Quli (given Daliki village and killed there about 1891). Mulla Muhammad Shafi (killed by retainers about 1871; married 5 wives ; I 10 sons). Mulla ’Abbas Quit (killed by retainers about 1895).

KAM FlRftZ— Daughter (married Khwajeh Farajullah Khan (born *Abdullah Nasir-ud-DIvan). 1909 just before his father’s death). A large district of Fars north of Shiraz, bounded on the north by Mahin and Abraj, on the east by Marvdasht, on the south by Baiza, on the west by Ardakan and Dizkurd. It is a beautiful valley between two ranges of high mountains, clothed wuth trees and bushes. To the south-west a range about 14,000' in elevation stands boldly up. To'the west the summit of the Kuh-i-Dina is just visible. The valley is highly cultivated and full of fine crops ; it is covered with villages, and down its centre flows the fine broad187 fresh-water river Kur, whose banks are clothed with trees and bushes. The river here is a clear and rapid stream containing large fish, and has numerous fords passable by men on foot. The chief ford by which the road crosses is almost due south of the town, and runs straight across the river, which is 40 yards broad with a depth of 2' to 3' and a bed of gravel. The forests to the south are said to contain bear, leopard and wild boar. The villages of Bakian, Bdu, Khan-i-Man, and Palangi are said to have been sold by Haji Nasrullah Khan Qashqai to the Mushir-ul-Mulk. The rest of the district seems to have belonged in 1891 to the former. The estimated population of the district is 3,500. It includes the following villages Name. Lati. O Longi.

KANGAN, Lat. 27° 49'; Long. 52° 8'— With the exception of its small dependency Banak, Kangan is the northern most of the Shlbkuh ports on the Persian coast and the only one lying north of the region in which the main maritime range falls directly into the sea. These high hills first strike the coast about 5 miles west of Kangan. The port is situated at the east end of a large bay, open to the south, but fairly well- sheltered from the shamal; at the opposite end of the Bay, 9 miles to the west, stands the river port of Daiyir (q.v.). Kangan is 20 miles north-west of the next considerable Shlbkuh port, that of Tahir! (q.v.) and is due north of Bah rain, 140 miles distant. The place normally consists of some 300 Arab families of mixed tribes; §rds of the population are Sunnis, the rest Shi’ahs), this giving a population of about 1,500. The people are fishermen, pearl divers and sailors owning large boats, which run to Qatar, Bahrain, Qatlf, Basrah and various Persian ports ; also a dozen baqdrehs of the kind called amileh which are used for fishing ; they also cultivate dates and grain. There b2 %191 arc 200 date-palms. Good water in 3 wells 25' to 30' deep and a hot medi cinal spring. The anchorage is fair, but inferior in a to that of Dai- yiv. A square fort in the middle of the town, 20 shops, usual exports and imports. Kangan, once the site of a Portuguese factory, has always been a bone of contention between the Khan of Dashti and his neighbours in the south. It was formerly in the possession of the Khan of Gabandi, who about 1815 put the kaiklmdd to death on suspicion of an intrigue to hand over the place to the Khan of Dashti. Thereupon the latter attacked and destroyed Kangan, ravaging the coast and destroying all the date-groves as far as Tahirl. The Persian Government twice appointed a commission to report on the occurrence, but on both occasions the commissioner was bought over by the Khan of Dashti and no result followed. For at least seven years Kan gan remained a heap of ruins, to the benefit of Daiyir. A customs post was established here in 1904 : the mudlr was murdered and the office sacked in 1910. Klz draws most of its supplies from Kangan. Brucks mentions the Khur Jaihira, in Latitude 28° 9', longitude 51° 21', a small river rising in the hills and falling into the sea a few miles south of Kangan. 180. KAVlR. Lat. 29° 12'; Long. 52° 42'. A district and village S.-F. of Shiraz, traversed by the road from Shiraz to Jahrum. At 7 miles from Dch Nan (23 miles from Shiraz) the Maharlu hills on the left throw out a low spur, dividing the plain of Shiraz from that of Kavar. It is crossed by the Gardan-i-Baba Hail, which is about 150' high. The plain is watered by the Kara Aghach river, which enters the plain by a gorge between Kuh-i-Siakh and Kuh-i-Safid-dar, and which, by a stone dam, supplies water to irrigation canals. The village of Kavar is surrounded by orchards and a cluster of small villages. The ^raz ing is reported to be fair. The whole plain is under cultivation Wood is largely cut in the hills round and sold in Shiraz. of the dlstr ! ct are to tiiC north Sarvistan, to the E. Khafr, to the S. Khwajal, to the W.

The town is divided into the upper (Bald) and lower (Pain) and covers a considerable space. The buildings are of stone and mortar and have an appearance of solidity and neatness which is wanting in mud habitations : they are also frequently stuccoed. Many of them are fortified possessing parapets and loop-holes for musketeers. Excepting in size, the place hardly deserves the name of a town, as it is, more properly speaking, a conjunction of two large villages and possesses only about a hundred shops. The si nation is on the north-west side of a well cultivated vale on a slight rise. Palms and walnut, orange and lemon trees are nearly the only verdure it possesses. There is nothing of interest to be seen in the place, except the antiquities which are to be found on the hills behind the town. They consist of some traces of an old fort and an empty cistern which supplied the fort with water. The town suffered severe ly in the faminfc of 1879-80. The qandt, on which the water-supply depends, dried up, many people died and many more had to leave and seek work and food in Bushire and Shiraz. There is an office of the Indo-European Telegraph Department here, open for international traffic, as well as a telegraph office of the Persian administration. Population. —The population is variously stated at 4,000 souls and 1,500 to 2,000 families. Stack in 1881 estimated the number of inhabitants of Kazarun at 8,000; in 1889 Curzon estimated the population at between 2,000 and 2,500; Newcomen in 1905 said the population was 5,000 to 6,000 and Gibbon in 1908 said there were 1,200 houses. Chick gives it as 12,000 in 1912. The total population of the valley is about 20,000 souls and is well armed. They are quick-tempered and are always fighting each other. Supplies and Resources .—Excellent opium is produced in the villages around, obtained from the white poppy. The people are proud of their orange gardens, but the oranges are either sour or bitter ; great attention is given to the cultivation of the poppy. Pro visions are abundant here, except in spring, and the valley abounds in forage; it is said to te very healthy except in the autumn months. Water is sup plied principally from qandls. It is noteworthy that Kazarun is the home of many muleteers engaged on the Bushire-Shlraz road. Firewood can be procured. Warm felts, coarse carpets, hair ropes for draught cattle, pack saddles for draught cattle and an easy shoe for hill-marching form the manufactures of the place. Blacksmiths, farriers, leather-dressers and tent-makers are to be found here and in the vicinity. Timber, called safiddr, which is a white poplar, plane and walnut trees, are procur able. Saltpetre is found in the neighbourhood and powder might be made here with little labour. Snow is collected in the mountains to the north east of the town and brought down for use in summer. Towards the Shahpur end of the valley are rice swamps and a large amount of rice is imported from Khuzistan and the Mamassanl district. Mules and horses of a good stamp could be bought during the cold wea ther from nomad tribes and a few are often available in the town itself. The revenue of Kazarun is chiefly in kind, some 700,0001fes. of grain being taken by the Divan. The village of Dawun is farmed to the ParsI bankers Jamshidian.194 The district of Kazarun pays 25,000 Tumdns mdlldt per annum. The place would form a suitable base for a force advancing against Shiraz from Bushire. Camel grazing scarce : 3,000 men and animals would find food for a month at least. Climate .—Warmer than Shiraz in summer, but not oppressively hot. The Government of Kazarun has been for the past few years entrusted to Khans of Qashqai clans or to underlings of the Governor-General and the Ilkhdm; these, however, change constantly and the permanent ruler of the town is Khwajeh ’Abdullah, Nasir-ud-Diwan, hereditary Kaldntar, brother of the late Khwajeh Ibrahim. Three generations ago this family emigrated from tfie Khwajeh family of the Haft Lang branch of the Bakhtiaiis. He is connected by marriage with the Sardar-i-Naidun. The villages of the Shahpur end of the valley are in the hands of the Kashkuli Khans, who encamp on the banks above the Shahpur river, spring and autumn. Similarly the caravansarai Klnvajeh Ibrahim, off the end of the Tang-i-Turkan, is occupied by Kashkuli tribesmen and others. Daris is a large village with some 100 tvfangchis ruled by Darodar Ilajab. Pul-i-Abgineh is in the independent control of Muhammad Isma’il Khan, its Kadkhudd, who is a near relation of the Kadkhudd of KalunI in the Dasht-i- Barm. The Kunja’-i-Khamseh were owned by the Imam Juma of Shiraz, but the Kashkuli and Farsimaidan Khans forcibly took po ssess,on of them in the autumn of 1911.

The halting place consists of several camps of Lurs, situated at the point where the Shahpur river issues from the hills j on to the plain of Kazarun. The habita tions consist of pieces of wood and | bushes and there are about 100 families in the place, belonging to the Dushman- ziari Mamassanls. Firewood is very plen tiful here.

Name. Lat. Long. To see the ruins of Shahpur following the telegraph poles along the Kamarij road for a little over 5 miles, and then striking across the plain in the direction of the north-westerly cliff wall, the track becomes involved in a wilderness of tu muli, consisting of loose stones and broken down structures, filling a circuit of seve ral miles, at the base of the mountains. These mounds rise to a height of 50 to 60 feet above the surrounding plain. These are the ruins of the city of Shahpur. Through the northern cliffs cuts the gorge of the Shahpur river, known as the Tang-i- Chakan, its sides being a sheer rock face, in many parts of several hundred feet high. In the wilderness of ruins that marks the site of the ancient city, few remains are now capable of identifica tion. The only ruin of any moment is that of a building 50 feet square, one wall of which is still standing though half buried in the soil. In the very jaws of the gorge on a spur on the south-east cliff, are the remains of an old castle. There is no doubt that this, which is called the Kaleh-i-Dukhtar, is the remains of the ancient citadel. In the gorge on both sides are cut bas-reliefs in the rock, two on the left, and four on the right, bank of the river.

The district is bounded on the N. by Sarvistan and Fasa, on the E. by Jahrum, on the S. Simakan and Khwajai, on the W. by Kavar. It is one of the most highly cultivated and densely populated districts of Ears ; the estimated population is 8,000. It includes the following villages :—203 ,• 184. KHISHT.— Lat. 29° Long. 51° 25'; Elev. 1,800'. A plain at the head of the Kutal-i-Mallu, on route 53, -Jrdof the wav from Bushire to Shira?:. It is a plain of irregular oval shape, 10 miles long by 5 miles broad, and counts as a district for revenue and administrative purposes. Except at the point where it overlooks the pass it is surrounded by hills. The Shahpur river winds down through the hills past Shahpur, enters the plain of Khisht on its east side and keeping close to the hills, which skirt the plain to the east and north, passes below the village and fort of Khisht on its way to the Gulf. The plain is well-irrigated by this river, and wheat, barley, rice, tobacco and cotton are extensively grown ; date palms flourish and there are said to be upwards of 2,000 in the plain, which is sparsely wooded with 'kundr and brushwood. There are supposed to be 31 hamlets subordinate to Khisht: as far as possible their names are given below :—The plain is for the most part if not entirely the property of Riza Quli Khan, the Nizam-us- Saltaneh: the revenue demand is about 7,000 tumdm. The district is bounded on the N. by the Mahur-i-Milati, on the E. by Kazarun, on the S. by Dashtis- tan, on the west by Mazar’ai:— Name. Lat. Long. Distance and direc tion from fort of Khisht.

KHURMUJ. — Lat. 28° 40'; Long. 51° 25'; Elfv. 465'. The principal to^Ti of the Dashti district, 20 miles from the sea at the foot of the Kuh-i-Bairam, 40 miles S.-E. of Bushire. A village of 100 or so mud huts ; traces still exist of the old town which was destroyed by the Governor of Shiraz at the beginning of the XIX century. Date groves almost hide the old fort from the broad flat Dashti plain, on the edge of which it stands. A small stream from the hills behind is utilised for watermills and irrigation, but wells are used for drinking-water. Grazing is excellent; barley, wheat plentiful, meat in small quantities. Routes from all directions converge across the open plain to this point, as will be seen by a reference to the 4 miles = 1 inch map. It is not, however, on any main trade route. The fort, which internally in 1865 was comfortably and elegantly furnished, is now much dila pidated, but some good stone and plaster work testify to its former condition. It belongs to the chief of Dashti, Jamal Khan, son of Haidar Khan. Tue population is estimated at 500. 188. KUHMARRFH.— A hilly district S. of Shiraz : it is bounded on the N. by S'akh, on the S. by Jirreh, on the E. by Khwajai, FIruzabad, and Farrash- band, on the W. by the Manr ssanl country. It is inhabited by Turk and Lur tribes, partly nomadic, partly sedentary, who are counted among the Qashqai: the Kashkuli and Farsimaidan frequent the district, on their way up and down country : the Darashuri usually keep to the North of it, and the Shish Buluki to the South. The Suqulmaji and Gau tribes are amongst the minor tribes who camp in this district. The principal sedentary Lur tribes are known as Maliki and Parr Shikaftl. r208 The following villages are included in the district, the population of which is estimated at 3,000 :— Name.

Shiraz on road to Biishire ; plain is 8 miles broad; it is well cultivated and affords excellent pasturage. The lower portion of the plain is filled in wet weather by a lake, men tioned as long ago as 10th Century by Istftkhri; in summer it is a swampy marsh. The plain is bounded on the S. by lime stone hills, well wooded ; on the E. and W. are limestone cliffs 200' high ; on the N. sandstone and gypsum. The soil is a black alluvial deposit. In spring there is a good deal of grass On this plain and fuel is always procurable. The climate is said not to be good, fever being prevalent. The maneless lion of Persia was formerly found here and Major St. John, R. E., then in the I. E. T. D., was attacked by a lioness when on horseback in the neighbourhood in 1867. The village of Dashtarjan is clustered against the base of the N. hills and just outside’ of it are the quarters of the I. E. T.

LIRAWI.— This district extends from 7 miles N. of Dilam to Sabz Pushan 31 miles S.-S.-E. of that place, and is bounded by a low maritime range not over l.OOO' in height, 6 miles from the sea at the N. end, 18 miles at the S. end. The principal points on the coast are Ras-ut-Tunub, 8 miles S. of Dilam, a long sandy point, Khur Lailatain, a small creek 1 mile S. of Tunub, Khur Sim, another small creek, with deep water inside, S.-S.-E. of Lailatain, and finally Sabz Pushan, a slightly projecting rocky point, which has a small watercourse to the S. and is itself 18 miles S.-S.-E. of Khur Sini. The most striking object inland is Kuh-i-Bang, an isolated group of hills rising to 1,000' 24 miles S.-S.-E. from Dilam and Smiles from the coast; these hills stretch for 12 miles parallel to the coast; they are precipitous to seawards and contain salt and gypsum ; apart from these hills the dis trict is low, consisting of grassy plains and occasional exposures of light grey sandstone. Climate .—Probably very similar to that of Bushire ; water from wells ; S. of Ras Tuniio tne coast can be approached to within 1 mile by vessels of moderate size. ro'pvlcdion. —Al! Shi’ahs (a few Babis reported at Shalir Vairan) of mixed Arab and Lur blood, of no particular tribe. Total about 6,000 including Dilam {q.v.). They are quiet and not fanatical, mainly agriculturists or fishermen ; well-armed ; they live in huts except in Dilam. The district is visited during the winter months by the Darashurl and Kashkuli (?) sec tions of the Qashqai, who spend in some cases the summer in the Bibi Haki- meh hills 40 miles inland. 2e2219 it is frequented by Mamassani tribes in its N. part, and perhaps also by Kuhgalu. The S. portion is the winter quarters of the Kashkuli and Darashuri. It contains the following places or villages, none of which are marked on our maps :— Babamir, Jamalkar, Kuh-i-Dara, Kuh-i-Parikadeh, Malcheh-i-Shaikh Hasan, Ma’dan-i-Naft-i-Siah (oil wells), MIshun, Milati and Mahall-i-Sam- sam-i-Hazrat-i-Amir (a shrine). The oil springs do not seem to have been examined by experts: it would appear that they are too far from the sea to be of much practical importance. Their approximate position is Lat. 30° 10', Long. 51° 10'. Estimated seden tary population 1,000. 193. MAIMAND.— A small district bounded on the N. and E. by Khafr, on the S. by Arba’eh, on the W. by Khwajai and Firuzabad ; a tribe named Gurki (Qashqai ?) is said to inhabit the district: the village of the same name is a largish one, where mules can be shod, etc. Firewood is reported plentiful in the district. The estimated population is 1,000. The district includes the following villages :— Name. Lati tude. Longi tude. Notes. Deh Bala Maimand Salira Safid ..

MARVDASHT.— A district of Fars consisting of a plain 22 miles N. of Shiraz, crossed by the main road to Isfahan (No. 59), 15 miles wide from N. to S. and stretching south-east towards Arsinjan for 40 miles : the last-named exten sion is known as Khafrak (q.v.). It is bounded on the N. by the districts of Kamin and Mahin, on the E. by Arsinjan, on the S.-W. by Shiraz, on the W. by Kam Firuz. Qavdts and irrigation channels, dependent on the Bandamir, intersect it in every direction and have always rendered it a fertile spot. In Le Brun’s day, less than two centuries ago, the plain was said to contain 880 villages : it now numbers from 50 to 60, with a total estimated population of 10,000. So inadequate is the control of the water supply, that the plain often lies half under water : the soil of the plain is alluvial, and is fairly free from stones. It is higher than Shiraz and could support a large population. The products of the district from winter sowings are wheat, barley, bran, and a226 Name. Sultan Vilayat Tajabad Takht-i-Jamshid or Per- sepolis (5,500'). Lat. Long. 29 58 52 54 Notes. \ 40 houses, in hills N. of Takht-i-Jamshid. 30 houses. Situated on the plain of Marvdasht, some 40 miles N.-E. of Shiraz and not far from where the river Pulvar flows into the Kur. The central structure is a large terrace with its E. side resting on the Kuh-i- Rahmat. The other three sides are formed by a retaining wall, varying in height from 14' to 41', and on the W. side a magnificent double stair leads to the top. On this terrace stand and lie the ruins of a number of colossal build ings all constructed of calcareous lime stone, resembling marble, hewn from the neighbouring mountain. These ruins, for which the name Chihil Minar can be traced back to the 13th century, are now known as the Takht-i-Jamshid. That they represent the Istakhr or Per- sepolis, captured and partially destroy ed by Alexander the Great, is beyond dispute. It has been ascertained from the inscriptions that some of the edifices arc the work of Darius I, Xerxes and Artaxerxes HI. The ruins on the plat form consist of—(1) The porch of Xerxes; (2) Hall of Xerxes ; (3) Palaces of Darius ; (4) Palace of Artaxorxes HI; (5) Palace of Xerxes; (6) South-East edifice ; (7) Hall of 100 columns. Behind the Takht-i- Jamshid are three tombs hewn out of the rock in the hillside, the facades being richly ornamented with reliefs. They are prob- ably those of Atraxerxes H, B. C. 361, Artaxerxes HI, B. C. 338, and Darius HI. B. C. 330. Beneath the ruins are a large number of underground passages, which, it is conjectured, were originally used as water-channels. About 2 miles distant from the Takht-i- Jamshid, near the N.-E. extremity of the plain and close to the post-house of Puzeh- i-Takht-i-Jamslud, in a small natural recess in the base of the cliff, art situated the sculptures of the Naqsh-i-Rajab. They v ere mutilated by order of the Shah SfifI I to discourage European visitors. The tablets consist of (1) and (2) Ormuz and Ardashjr, (3) Shapur and body-guard.Name. Notes. Long. On the opposite side of the Pulvar and at the W. extremity of the Husain Kuh rises a perpendicular wall of rock, called by the Persians the Naqsh-i-Rustam. The sculptures can be seen from the post- house of Puzeh, which is about l£ miles distant. There are seven bas-reliefs at the Naksh-i-Rustam—(1) Valerian and Queen ; (2) and (3) Equestrian combats, 390 A. 1). ; (4) Shapur and Valerian, 260 A. D. ; (5) Equestrian combat ; (6) Valerian II and his Coutriers ; (7) Ormuz and Ardaslilr. Hewn out of the rock of the cliff are four tombs. Prom the in scription it is known that the second from the E. is that of the Great Darius, B. C. 485. The others are probably the tombs of Xerxes, B. C. 465. Artaxerxes I, B. C. 424, and Darius H, B. C. 405. Oppo site the third and fourth tombs, on a slight elevation, rises a square building called at various times the Naqqaroh Klianeh and the Ka'beh-i-Zardusht. Its origin is problematical. Takht-i-Tfifls 15 houses ; near carriage road, at entrance to Khafrak plain ; it takes its name from some small ruins close to road.

MAZARA’I— A small district belonging to the Government of Pars, though part of the Persian Gulf coastal strip ; it lies on both banks of the Rud Shlrln or Shahpur River, just below the point where it emerges from the hills. Hills enclose it on west, north and east: on the south it lies open to the flat plains of Dash- tistan and Zira. Mazara’i itself is a plain and suffers extremes of heat in summer. The inhabitants are Persians of mixed tribes, numbering about 3,000 souls. They cultivate wheat, barley and dates, and export some wool, dates, and a considerable quantity of gum, collected in the hills, to Bushire. The local Hashim man is equal to 20 Tabriz mans. Mazara’i possesses about 700 donkeys, besides a few mules and horses. The Nizam-us-SaJtaneh, to whom the district practically belongs, manages the affairs of the district through an agent. He takes about 2,500 turndns228 a year from the district, his demands being half the produce of the dates and 60 krans for every gau of grain sown. Administration .—In 1909 there was a quarrel between the Kashkulis and Isma il Khan over the district. After a raid by the Kashkulis right across Shabankareh, the question was settled, by arbitration of Haiat Daud, the revenue being paid to the Kashkuli Khans each year, while the control of the district is left to one of the Shabankareh Khans, viz., Agha Khan, who sent his brother as his deputy.

NAIDUN— This district lies to the north-east of the Kazarun valley, immediately over the range of mountains backing Kazarun. Ingress is given by the Tang-i-Chakan pass at Shahpur and from the Dasht-i-Barm west of Abdul. It contains some 12 villages, all subject to the Sardar-i Naidun, who resides at Naidun and is related to the Kaldntars of Kazarun. There is consider able rice cultivation in the valley and the lower villages such as Naidun and Gurgidun are uninhabitable in the summer owing to inject pests. The inhabitants send all their animals away to the upper mountains or to Dasht- arjan. The valley is very fertile, its upper villages in the hills,- such as Dusarun, producing fruit of all kinds, whilst the rice of the lower villages is well known.

A town and district in Ears at the south end of L. Niriz. The town, which is scattered amongst groves and gardens, is surrounded by extensive culti vation of cereals and opium. The suburbs extend 2 miles to the west. The town contained in 1903 about 2,500 houses, 4 sarai^, a large mosque, and four baths. To the north is a crag with the remains of fortifications on the top. There is a strange barn-shaped mosque without a dome, and with its sides supportd with flying buttresses of mud : also two wind towers. In the vicinity is a fine garden with cypress trees and a pleasure house, belonging to the daughter of Fath ’Ali Khan, wife of the son of Asaf-ud-Dauleh. Stotherd in 1893 estimated the population at 6,000 at least, but it is pro bably not over 4,000 now. The population of the town is purely Persian, and quite distinct from the tribes dwelling on the shore of the Lake, which should be classed as nomadic, though they do not shift their quarters with the change of season. The chief export is opium. The district is bounded on the N. by Shahr-i-Babak and Sirjan (Yazd), on the S. by Istehbanat and Darab, on the E. by Sab’eh, on the W. by Abadeh-i-Tashk and Bawanat. The estimated population of the whole district including the town is 14,000 souls. The district includes the following villages: — Name. Lat. Long. Notes.

RUDHILLEH (district)— A small district of Ears subordinate to the Governor of the Gulf Ports, wedg d in between Haiat Daud on the N., the sea on the W. and S. and Angali and Shabankareh on the E. It now practically forms part of Haiat Baud. Limits and 'physical characteristics .—The geographical district of Rudhilleh is some 21 miles long from near Shif to BIdu, and 19 miles wide from the sea to near Kurrehband. It is bounded on the West by the sea from the outflow of the Shur-i-Bldu to some 5 miles north-west of Shif, which is in Angali; North by the Shur-i-Bldu.240 V East : it is separated from the district of Sbabankareh by a line running north from the Rudhilleh river, between the villages of Mainun in Rudhilleh and Mulcabari in Shabankareh as far as the Sur of Bidu near Anjiru : South of the Rudhilleh river the boundary with Angali is between Kurrehband and Bardaki in Angali and then runs . south to within a few miles of Shif. The coast of the district opposite Bushire is swampy, but at its extreme * south point called Tahima there is a rocky patch. Throughout its length the coast is only a few feet above sea level. The district is flat and the only important feature is the Rudhilleh River. The climate is said to be milder than that of the surrounding districts. Population. —About 4,000, mainly Arabs, bilingual and Sunnis, some of them Ka’b from Fallahiyeh, some Bam Hajir and BanI Tamim from Arabia. Both classes say they took refuge from Turkish oppression here two centuries ago. The Bani Tamim claim to be the earlier settlers. The villages consist of huts usually defended by small towers. Agriculture. —Wheat, barley, melons and a few dates are produced ; there are some cattle and perhaps 1,000 sheep. Trade is of no account: wool, wheat, barley and melons go to the Persian Gulf ports ; some 2,000 tons of wheat were exported in 1911 ; im ports of necessaries are all from Bushire. Kranssne current. The local HC.shim man is equivalent to 20 Tabriz mans. The gaz equals 401'. Communications and Transport. —Routes 54 and 55 pass through the dis trict and reference is invited to them. The Rudhilleh River is a considerable obstacle : ferries exist at Mahmadi and MuhrizI : there is a fort at ’Askari where the Bushire-Muhammareh road crosses it. The district is said to be able to produce 250 horses, 1,300 donkeys and 200 mules. 50 boats are owned, plying to Kuwait, Basrah and elsewhere. Colonel Pelly says :—“ This district rears a good half-breed horse, half Persian, half Arab ; they pass under the name of the Arab Ka’b horse ; the principal defects of this breed are found in a small arm and a falling off in the hind quarters. They are better roadsters than the pure Ajab, but lack his quietness and endurance ; by re-crossing the Rudhilleh K’ab with a pure Arab it is found that a good serviceable horse of large bone and height is obtained, but he is never as serviceable as the pure Arab.” The Rudhilleh is also called the Shatt-Bani Tamim by Arabs ; it rises near Kaleh Safid and traverses the Shahpur valley ; it is sweet until it is joined by the DalakI stream ; it is fordable only at Kaleh Sirhan where it is 100 yards wide, 2' 6' deep, with banks 12' high and a firm sandy bottom. Administration. —The district is subject to the Governor of the Gulf Ports. About 60 years ago it came under the Khan of Angali, with whom it remained until its transfer 6 years later to the Khan of Haiat Daud, who manages it through a brother of his own Husain Qull Khan, stationed at Mahmadi. There is a customs post at Mahmadi. The district is farmed for 3,560 Tumdns.246 m r r * East by the river Shahpiir, or Shlrln, from where the Mahur descends towards the river north of Sa’dabad in Zira down to its junction with the Shur or Dalikl river at Durudgah. South by the combined river from Durudgah between the villages of Mukabarl and Mainun in Rudhilleh. North-west by the river between the villages mentioned up to the Shur-i-Bidu at Anjlru. West from the Shur (or salt stream, later known as the Shur-i-Bidu) flowing from the Mahur-i-Shabankareh : then between Khalifeh and Cheharustai in Haiat Daud about 1 mile from the latter place, and past Anjiru. Its length from north-west to south-east is thus about 20 miles and its breadth 12 miles. Phj/sical characteristics .—Except for the seaward slopes of the Taviseh hills, which are included in the district, Shabankareh appears to consist en tirely of flat, open country. It is crossed by various water courses from the hills, but there arc none of importance between the Rud-i*Shur, on the east, and the Rud-i-Shur on the west. Water is generally obtained from wells, but the villages on the Rudhilleh river procure their supply from that stream. In summer, hot winds blow for three months from June to August, but the temperature falls considerably at night. Inhabitants .—The inhabitants.mostly belong to Persian speaking tribes, who have been settled here from time immemorial ; but there are a few villages of immigrants, from neighbouring Persian districts, and Arab settlers. Most of the people belong to small or obscure tribes : the inhabitants of Deh Kuhneh, the principal village of the district, are described as Haijab and Khajahvan. With few exceptions the people profess the faith of the Shi’ah sect of the Muhammadan religion. They are neither fanatical nor turbulent, but are well-armed, and Martini rifles are said to be as numerous as households. The dwellings in most places are huts, but about ^rd are houses of sun-dried brick. A list of the principal villages is given below. Most of the villages of this district have one or two small towers for purposes of defence. The total population of the district amounts to about 10,000 souls. Agriculture .—Wheat and barley are the staples of cultivation, but there are date plantations in some of the villages and in particular places tobacco and water-melons are grown. Cotton has recently been introduced on a small scale. Livestock includes a fair number of cattle and several thou sands of sheep and goats. Trade .—There is a small export of wheat, barley, tobacco, straw and wool and a corresponding importation of piece-goods, rice, tea, coffee, sugar and spices. Business is chiefly with Bushire, the more northern villages dealing ■with that place through the port of Bandar Rig and the more southern through Shif. The standard of length is a gaz, about 2 inches longer than the English yard, and of weight a Hdshim man which varies from 18 to 24 Tabriz mans of Bushire. Persian krdns make up the bulk of the currency. 2i2 \247 Communications and transport .—Deh Kuhneh, the principal place in Sha- bankareh, lies upon the route from Burazjan to Bandar Dilam or Hmdian, and from Deh Kuhneh there is a track to the sea at Bandar Rig (No. 55); Shlf, on the coast opposite Bushire town, is easily accessible across country from the southern village of Shabankareh, the distance being about 15 miles. The transport resources are roughly estimated at 200 horses, 100 mules and 3,000 donkeys. In most villages where there are horses, mules also are found to about \ the number of horses. There are some camels. \ Administration .—Shabankareh is ruled by a hereditary Khan who is subject to the Governor of Ears : the present incumbent is Isma’il Khan and the family are said to have come from Fasa near Shiraz in the Firuzabad district and to have been first placed in charge of Shabankareh in the reign of Karim Khan Zand. The Khan at present pays 5,000 tuman'i a year for the farm of the district; he manages it through the kadkhudds or headmen of the villages. There are no arrangements for the administration of justice % and private retaliation of injuries is the rule, though to a certain extent disputes are adjusted by the Khan, by village headmen and local Qazis and Mullas. Land revenue is collected at the rate of 60 krans per 6 Hdshim man of seed sown : this works out at about 5 krdns per acre. There is also a cash tax on dates equal to £ of the value of the produce, and an annual poll-tax of one krdn per man is collected in addition. There is no official directly representing the Persian Government in the district. The districts of Mazara’i, {q.v.) Zira (q.v.) and Bibara (q.v.) are also administered by members of the ruling family. Bibafa is a small but rich district consisting of two villages only. Shabankareh is purely an agricultural district, but is noted for horse breeding. I he wealth of Zira lies in its date gardens, which are very ex tensive. The districts are divided up into spheres amongst the members of the ruling family, which is said to have been in Shabankareh for some 18 generations, Isma il Khan himself resides in, and controls Zira. His elder son Muhammad Ali Khan acts as his father s deputy at Deh Kuhneh and manages the western part. Rustam Khan, a brother of Isma’il Khan, looks after the part from Boiri north and south : Agha Khan, son of the deceased brother of Isma il Khan, resides at Darvai and rules over the southern part of Sha bankareh. The Shabankareh and Zira districts are said to be able to muster 1,500 tufangchis. The chief political feature is enmity and blood-feud with Burazjan and Daliki oa account of Zira : relations with Haiat Daud are very cordial.252 Hill) 4 miles inland from Mialfl, height 4,660' feet: Sir-i-Yafal (in the Ad miralty chart called Sir! Yafal or ’Asalu Notch) 6 miles inland from NakhI Taqi and 4,870 feit high and Jabal Taranjeh 20 miles inland from Gurzeh, elevation 5,150'. We may here notice that a great trough, co-extensive with the portion of the maritime range just described, adjoins the range on its inland side, and is divided into two paits by a watershed which is behind Tahirl on the coast. Portions of this great valley are still unsurveyed, but the part of it to the north-west of the watershed seems to drain to the upper course of the Mund river, while the major or south-western part apparently runs straight in the opposite direction to Clarence Strait, the channel be tween Qishm island and the sea. The valley contains 3 places of some import ance, whose trade with the outer world is conducted tlirough Shibkuh Ports; they are Galehdar, 8 miles from the sea at a point rather nearer to ’Asalu than to Tahirl; Tarak imeh, 20 miles inland from Shiyu; and Ishkanu, 22 miles from the coast at Maqam. It remains to describe the sub-features of the Shibkuh tract between the main range and the Persian Gulf. From Kangan as far as ’Asalu, a little over 40 miles, the main range immediately adjoins the coast and pre sents to it a fa?e apparently precipitous, on which, however, the fires of char coal burners are seen to twinkle at night. Immediately below Asalu is Xa- band bay and from there to another but less pronounced bay at Maqam - a distance of about 60 miles—the coast lies parallel to the foot of the main range at about 20 miles from it, the intervening space being occupied by the Gabandi valley which rises immediately inland of Shiyu and, skirting the foot of the main range, reaches the sea at the foot of Naband bay. Che Gabandi valley is separated from the coast by a sandstone ridge called Sha- hin Kuh, which is nowhere more than a mile or two from the shore, and in the neighbourhood of Shiyu attains its maximum height of 1,100 feet. The ridge continues along the coast till Maqam, when, the littoral making a fresh echelon seawards, it is left at some distance inland, and almost immediately terminates about 16 miles due east of Maqam. Between Shiyu. and Maqam, rather nearer to the latter, is a gap in the sandstone ridge, through which a small valley called Darveh Asuh comes down to the sea in a direction per pendicular to the coast: this valley has two branches in the interior, which unite at about 10 miles from the sea, one of them coming from the west from a point near the end of the Gabandi valley and the other from the east, from the watershed on the other side of which a valley called Hamiru has its origin. The Hamiru valley from its source at first runs eastwards, then bends southwards round the end of sandstone ridge to the east of Maqam and finally goes westwards, reaching the sea at Maqam in an opening between two parallel ranges similar to that of the Gabandi valley at Naband. Che southern range in this case is another ridge of sandstone wlrch extends from Ras Naband for 50 miles to Charak, where it ends, closely adjoin ing the shore throughout its length : between Chirii and Charak it lias an elevation of 2,000 to 3,000 feet. The greater part of the interval to the north of this ridge between it and the great maritime range is occupied by the turn of Hamiru valley already described, and by a tributarv which it receives from the east, but the remainder consists of the basin of the Galshan v ^I le y» CJolG.SB253 which has its mouth on the coast less than a mile to the east of Charak. Beyond Charak a gap about 5 miles in width occurs in the coast ridge, here 15 miles inland, broken only by some dark-coloured detached hills between 1,000 and 2,000 feet high. Between the gap and Mughu, the last of the Shlb- kuh ports in this direction, the detached hill Kuh Namaki (in the Admiralty chart called Jabal Yarid) rises close to the sea to an elevation of 1,200 feet. The strata of the sandstone ridges which skirt the sea below Has Naband dip towards the coast, and it appears not improbable that the ridges them selves have been formed by the gradual elevation of the greater inner lime stone range through a bed of superincumbent, light-coloured sandstone. It is worthy of remark that, while the limestone range gives birth to many fresh springs and streams and is clad, though sparsely, with almond, dwarf oak, hawthorn, rose and terebinth, the sandstone produces hardly a shrub or a grass, and the streams that spring from them are generally brackish. The actual coast of the Shibkuh ports district possesses no remarkable fea ture unless we reckon the islands of Shaikh Shu’aib, Hindarabi, Qais, Farur and Nabiu Farur. Dangers of navigation, apart from these conspicuous islands, are few and north of Shiyu the tide-stream is either faint o^ imper ceptible. Population .—number of houses in the Shibkuh district—the valleys of Gabandi, Darveh Asuh and Gulshan in the interior being excluded— appears to be about 3,000, but at the present time (1906), in consequence of recent emigrations, there is at most places a considerable proportion of un occupied houses and the actual total population cannot be estimated at more than 13,000 souls. Persians of unmixed descent art' few in the district, and such as are found are mostly settlers from Lar and other Persian districts j the bulk of the people are of mmgled Persian and Arab blood, and the tribes to which they belong are of no consequence. The following Arab tribes are, however, deserving of notice :— Name. Estimated number of souls in the Shib- kuh district. Where found. Remarks.. *A1I (Al) 3,500 (also 300 in the Lingeh dis trict).

The Shaikh at Mughu belongs to a sec tion called Al Sulaiman. 'Ubaidli 1,500 .. At ChTru and on HindarabI island. Sunnis. They claim to be a section of a larger tribe called Ahmadeh, and say they are derived from the ’Abdeh Shammar of Najd. The ’Aba- dileh of Trucial ’Oman are said to be a branch of the tribe. The sections of the ’Ubaidll of Chiru and Hinda rabI are Bu’Ali, Al Bu ’Ali, Bu Haslna, Maghair, Mahafir, BanI Muhanna, BanI Muqbil, and Bu Sulaiman. Armament .—The proportion of rifles varies from place to place ; in some localities as much as frds of the male adult population are armed, in other not more than £th. Agriculture, trade, weights and measures, etc .—Wheat barley and dates form the staples of agriculture and cultivation is carried on entirely without recourse to irrigation. Piece-goods are the principal import, and tobacco from the interior is the chief article of export. Trade relations are with Lingeh town, Trucial ’Oman and Bahrain. The unit of weight is a man, equal to 9 lbs. English, and that of length a gaz or double zar of 38 inches. Routes and transport .—A route, presenting no special difficulties, follows the sea-coast from Kangan to Naband valley, from the foot of which it runs up the Gabandl valley, traverses the upper basins of the Asuh and Gul- shan valleys, and passes across the swampy plain of the Lingeh district to Lingeh town;* there is a land route along the coast from Charak via Mughu to Lingeh town : one from Charak inland to Bastak and so to Lar, and a third, crossing the last, from Mughu to Lar. The coast route is fit for all arms. The following table explains the present organization (1905), for adminis trative and revenue purposes, of the Shibkuh district:— * *It was travelled over by Colville in 1865-66, vide his report forwarded to the Govern ment of Bombay by the Resident in the Persian Gulf with his letter No. 46 of 4th May 1866. The description of the route is unfortunately of small value as such: all the stages even are not specified. See Routes in Persia, Volume III, No. 10. ( v- 2*2Saif-ash-Shaikh (also the entire valleys of Gab and! and ’Asa- lages of Kundaran and Bavirdan.257 r Administration .—From this table it will be apparent that the Shibkuh dis trict is for the most part subject to the Governor-General of Fars, The third of the ’Asalu and Naband group of villages constitutes a curious exception and its transference to the jurisdiction of the Gulf Ports, represented locally by the Tamlni Shaikh Saar bin Mubarak, is not yet an accomplished fact; though it has been ordered by the Persian Government the hereditary Harami Shaikh of ’Asalu is still resolutely resisting the change. The prime movers in the innovation were the Customs Department, who have more influence with the Governor of the Gulf Ports than with the Governor General of Fars, and are consequently desirous that the principal Shibkuh ports should be brought under the authority of the former. The two groups of villages to the north of Asalu are, it will be seen, managed by the Khan of Dasht’, whose hereditary dominions they adjoin. The remainder of the coast with its islands is parcelled out among various Arab Shaikhs, namely the Nasuri Shaikh of Gabandi, the Hamadi of Muqam, the ’Ubaidli Sha’kh of Chiru, the A1 ’All Shaikh of Charak, and the Marzuqi Shaikh of Mughu. Hitherto the Persian Government have exercised little authority over the semi-inde pendent chiefs, but, should their experiment at ’Asalu prove successful, it is not improbable that, impelled by the Customs Department, they may pro ceed to destroy the power of the remaining hereditary Shaikhs in the southern part of the district. Up to the present time the local influence of the Shaikhs has generally been sufficient to deter outsiders from attempting to farm the revenues of their villages, which the Persian Government would otherwise have no hesitation in handing over to the highest bidders. The Shaikhs exercise considerable powers in their own districts, they settle all civil matters, except such as are of a semi-religious character (c.y., matrimonial cases) according to their own ideas of what is right and proper : they dispose of all criminal cases, inflicting at their discretion imprisonment and the bastinado, but not the penalty of death, and without their permission no stranger dare engage in pearl-fishing in their territorial waters. The executive and administrative powers of a revenue farmer, as for instance of the Khan of Dashti in this district, are similar to those of the local hereditary authorities, and would clash with the latter if introduced into the same place. At present the Southern Shibkuh Shaikhs are the revenue farmers of their own districts. Topography.

A city, the capital of Fars, by post road 326 miles south-south-east of Isfahan and 182 miles north-east of Bushire. It is situated on the right bank of a stream in a fertile and well-watered plain about 7 miles wide surrounded by mountains. Rich gardens and vineyards exist in its vicinity. The stream, which sometimes has a certain volume of water from Decem ber to April, is usually dry for the rest of the year, the water being used for irrigation purposes. It empties itself into the salt lake the upper margin of which is perhaps 12 miles from Shiraz in a south-easterly direction. Five miles south of Shiraz the valley is separated from an extensive marsh by a low range of hills. The city quarters and 'population .—The city is irregularly circular in shape, flanked by semi-circular towers, rising some feet above the parapet, which is bounded by a dry ditch. Both towers and wall are in bad repair, the latter in some instances having fallen and filled up the ditch so that it is quite easy to ride through the gaps. The southern wall is in tolerable repair. The circumference of the wall is about 4 miles but in more recent and peaceful times the suburbs have become enlarged so that the original outline is no longer clearly traceable. Shiraz, like all other Persian towns, has a certain number of deserted houses, which are allowed.to fall into ruins, though it compares favourably with most of them in this respect. More than half of the enclosed area of the city is taken up with bazaars, maiddns, the Governor’s palace, gardens, stables and other public buildings, leaving the remaining space for occu pation by the inhabitants.273 The city has 6 gates : viz., Isfahan, Bagh-i-Shah, Kazarun, Shah Da’I/Qassab Khaneh and Sa’id, and is divided into 11 quarters. The author of Fdrs- ndmeh-i-Ndsir~, published in 1895, quoting a census stated to have been taken in 1883, gives the total population of Shiraz at the latter date as 25,284 males, 28,323 females, total 53,607. Further details of this census are given in Chapter I. The present population is probably not over 40,000. Public buildings and objects of interest in the neighbourhood. —There are in Shiraz fifty considerable mosques, besides many others of inferior note to a total number of fifty,—eleven colleges, fourteen bazaars, thirteen cara- vansarais and fifty-six baths. Of all the mosques, the Masjid-i-’Ali, built in the Khalifat of the house of ’Abbas, is the most ancient. The Masjid- i-Nau, the largest mosque, not only in Shiraz, but also throughout Persia, was originally the palace of Atabak Shah, who, in a dangerous illness of his son, consulted the Mullas, and was informed (as the only means of the re covery of his child) that “ he must devote to the Almighty that which of all his worldly goods he valued most.” He accordingly converted his palace into a mosque and the Muhammadans add that his son was in consequence restored to health. Stack calls this also the most ancient of all the mosques. The Masjid-i-Juma’ is likewise claimed to be the oldest of the mosques of Shiraz ; its construction being ascribed to Amr bin Lais Saffar, about A.D. 891. There are six others of a date previous to that of Karim Khan Zend. Of the more modern mosques of Shiraz, the Masjid-i-Vakll, the only one built by the last named Prince, is the most beautiful. Karim Khan began to build a college, but never finished it; there were already six, one of the earliest of which (that founded by Imam Qull Khan) is still the most popular. Another was added by Hashim, father of HajI Ibrahim, the Wazlr of Path ’AH Shah, and the Pish Namaz and Mujtahid (Chief Priest of the city and founder of the Hashlmleh family) built another. The principal caravansarais, in which the better class of merchants and Sarafs have their offices, either open on the Bazar-i-Vakll or are situated in close proximity to it. Of the former may be mentioned the caravansara- i-Gumruk, Raughml (chiefly inhabited by ZardashtI merchants), Fil and Qawam; among the latter the best known are those of Mushlr-ul-Mulk (or Gulshan) and of Agha Jan. In former times, there existed the caravan- sarai of Qaisarleh Khan, built by Imam Qull Khan, of which the name only now exists ; the ground on which it stood is now used for the tanning of lambskins. Other caravansarais were the Dabbiighan, or that of the dres sers of sheepskins; the Rangrlzan or that of the dyers; and the Hinduan, where the Hindus resided. The very names of these have faded out of memory. Karim Khan enriched this capital with three public baths, two within and one without the town. Four have since been raised, but there were already before his reign nineteen similar foundations, wliile many later ones have been built. There are several mausoleums* in Shiraz; the most *The three most beautiful tombs are (as regards their domes) Shah Chiragh, conspicuous by its blue dome, Saiyid Nur Muhammad, and Saiyid Allah-ud-din Husain.274 distinguished of those without the walls being those of Hafiz and Sa’di; there is also beyond the city the dargdh of Mir ’Ali, son of Mirza Hamzeh and grandson of the Imam Musa. While the houses of Shiraz are, in general, small and the streets narrow and filthy, the great bazaar, built by Karim Khan, and commonly called the Bazar-i-Vakil, situated at the north-east corner of the city, forms a dist nguished exception to this general descrip tion. It is built in the shape of a cross and is about 500 yards in length by 120 yards in breadth, made of yellow burnt brick with a vaulted roof, 22 feet high, and a central dome at the intersection of its arms. It has numerous skylights, which, with its doors and windows, always admit sufficient light and air, whilst the sun and rain are completely excluded. This bazaar is allotted to the different traders of the city, all of whom have their assigned quarters, which they possess under strict regulations, and it is well supplied with goods imported from India, Constantinople, and Russia. The shops display good specimens of work in gold and silver, as well as of copper and brass work, cotton goods, tobacco, spices, dried fruits and European tinned and other goods. Local provisions of excellent quality, butchers’ meat (mutton), bread, vegetables and fruit—the last of most luscious appearance and quality—are found in abundance. The Ark, or citadel, in which the Governor-General of Ears resides, is a rectangular building about 80 yards square, with large open spaces on three sides. The palace within is far from being an elegant structure; the pillars of the Diwan Khaneh, its greatest ornament, having been removed by Agha Muhammad Khan to adorn his palace at Tehran. Frequent earthquake shocks have caused much damage to several of the principal buildings. The praises of Shiraz have been celebrated by many different persons and notably by Hafiz (the Anacreon of the East), who was a native of this city and is buried in a small garden, about half a mile north-west of the town. The tomb of the poet was erected by Karim Khan and is a plain block of white marble in the form of a coffin, on which are inscribed two of his poems and the date of his death. His works are not, as has been stated, chained to his tomb; but a splendid copy of them is always kept in an adjoining house. The simple dignity of the great poet’s resting- place has, however, been sadly marred by the erection over it in 1901, by Prince Shu a-us-Saltaneh, Governor-General of Ears, of a tawdry, painted, iron structure surmounted by tin flags. Not far from the tomb of Hafiz is the garden of Jehan Numa, known in the time of Karim as the Vakil’s garden. It was formerly reputed to be the most beautiful in the neighbour hood of Shiraz, but is now almost entirely shorn of its former charms. Other gardens are the Bagh-i-Takht, the property of the Shu’a-us-Sal- taneh ; the Bagh-i-Nau, the property of the Imperial Bank of Persia and the residence of their European officials; the Bagh-i-Iran, Dilkusha and Gulshan. The last, the property of the Qawam-ul-Mulk’s younger son, Nasr-ud-Dauleh, is now the finest garden of Shiraz. Stack considers the most remarkable relics of antiquity near Shiraz to be three wells on a rocky hill, 2 miles north-east of the city, the origin of which is unknown. They are probably older than the Muhammadan conquest. The hill is about 500 feet high, and very steep, seemingly composed of sandstone and limestone. Two of the deepest of these wells are275 on the side facing the city, the mouth of the larger being about 7 feet by 5, and its depth nearly 500 feet. The shaft evidently sinks through the whole depth of the hill, and is hewn in the solid limestone and smoothly cut; the side being perfectly plumb. The third v/ell at the back of the hill has seats, or ledges, cut in the rock above it. Remains of old forti fications encompass the summit of the hill, while from the topmost peak the whole plain of Shiraz can be seen, as well as the salt lake of Maharlu, 20 miles to the east. The city itself is a compact area in the landscape, overhung with smoke, and adorned by three blue domes. Most historians have agreed that the city of Shiraz was founded, in or about the year A. D. Hiotory and Adminia- 694, by Muhammad, son of Yusuf Zaki; but Cur- tration. zon dissents from this version and ascribes its more probable and original foundation to the Achoemenian or Sassanian kings. The city was much improved and beautified by the Dilami rulers, of whom the Samsam-ud-Dauleh, son of the famous Asad-ud-Dauleh, was the first to surround it with a wall 12 miles in circuit. The various dynasties of the Atabaks, who governed Fars with Shiraz as their capital, still fur ther adorned it. The city continued during the 15th century to grow in prosperity till, with the disappearance of local dynasties and the centralisa tion of Persia that followed on the accession of the Safavi line, it lost much of its importance. With various vicissitudes, the decline of Shiraz continued till 1751, when Karim Khan Zend, ruling on behalf of a Safavi puppet, re built the walls of stone which had disappeared, and further adorned the city with many beautiful buildings. With the fall of Lutf ’All Khan and the triumph of the Qajars, the stone walls were levelled to the ground and replaced by the present mean erections of mud, and Shiraz was degraded from the rank and appearance of a capital to that of a provincial town. Its government, however, remained an appanage of royalty, and has usually been held by a member of the ruling family. Fath ’ All Shah was Governor- General of Fars in his uncle’s lifetime, and, when Shah himself, deputed more than one of his sons to the post. In the reign of the late Shah, Nasir- ud-DIn, the office was filled by several of his relatives. The most con spicuous of these was an uncle, Farhad Mlrza, who earned a widespread reputation for bad government and pitiless severity. Fars was one of the many governments united in the person of the Zill-us-Sultan in the early eighties. A succession of weak but rapacious governors has resulted in later years in riots in Shiraz itself, and in the unsettled condition of the whole province of Fars. The Qawam-ul-Mulk, the hereditary Beglarbegi of Shiraz, was largely responsible for the most serious disturbances, brought about by a system of raising money which not infrequently commends itself to Persian Governors, but less so to the people. It consists in buying up all the available grain and reselling it at greatly enhanced prices. This proceeding caused a riot in 1886 which was suppressed by force by the Qawam. In doing so he incidentally shot down some of the populace in the mosque of Shah Chiragh. This act of sacrilege caused him to be held in the greatest detestation by the people. In 1891 occurred the tobacco riots in which the leader was a fanatical Mulla HajI Saiyid ’All Akbar. Seized and banished for his share in the disturbances, he was nevertheless permitted276 to return in the ensuing year, when he was greeted with frantic enthir- siasm by the populace and henceforward became a power in Shiraz. In 1892, on the assumption of the Governorship by the Eukn-ud-Dauleh, a relation of Nasir-ud-din Shah, the Qawam was degraded, imprisoned, and forced to leave the city, but, on the Kukn-ud-Dauleh himself falling into disgrace with the central authority, he re-entered the city with the incoming Governor in 1893 and returned to his old tactics of “ cornering ” the grain. The Qawam-ul-Mulk, in addition to his office in Shiraz, is also the nominal Ilkhdnl of the Arab and Baharlu tribes, and, by quarter ing a number of these in the city, and dispossessing the townspeople from their dwellings to accommodate them, as well as by degrading the copper coinage in value, he still further increased his unpopularity. A rio‘t of a serious nature, in which Saiyid ’All Akbar was a conspicuous leader, was the result, and in the suppression of it the most lamentable weakness and incapacity was displayed both by the provincial Governor and by the Shah himself. The disturbance was only quelled by the Qawam being again forced to leave the city and by the demands of the populace being granted. Although the riot was in no sense directed against the English, the lives of the Indo European T&gt;'lt graph staff and of the British Agent in Shiraz, an Indian by name Nawab Haidar ’AH Khan, were for some days in jeopardy. One of the most recent Governors, the Shu’a-us-Saltaneh, a younger son of the present Muzaffar-ud-DIn Shah, who succeeded to the Governorship in 1901, incurred considerable odium by his harsh government and by again “ cornering” grain ; and a somewhat serious riot resulted, during which the Persian telegraph offices were wrecked. During the disturbances the Qawam-ul-Mulk was appointed Acting Governor, but he did little to satisfy the people and the prince was eventually reinstated. This prince is reported to have curbed the power of the Mullas during his tour of office. He was reappointed in 1901; but his rapacity and bad gove] nment led to further serious disturbances and his removal after a second period of some 18 months of office. A further account of events in Shiraz from 1904 onwards will be found in Chapter II.

A rocky hill and fortress some 70 miles north ...... i i west of Sh'raz ; on the left bank of the Fahlirm river. The hill fets its name from the white colour of its rocks, and from the fact of its being used as a strong hold in times of disturbances. It is an isolated precipitous hill, 4 to 6 miles in length, 2 miles in breadth, and has a broad base, perhaps 5J[ miles in diameter. Near its summit it presents an abrupt rampart, and its crest is said to be acces sible by three paths, only known to the ManiassanI, though other writers say that there is only one way to the top and that not an easy one. The sides are scarps of perpendicular rock. There is a roadm Name. Lat. Long. O Notes. Kaleh Safid-— contd. cut along the face of the rock, defended by two towers and a gate. At the summit of the rock, which is about 1,000 feet above the plain, is a fine, level plateau about three-fourths of a mile square, the soil fine and with numerous springs of water. It was taken both by Alexander and Timur. The only fortifications are a line of huge stones ranged in regular order round the edges of the precipices. Each of th se is wedged beneath by another of smaller dimensions; when the smaller one is re moved, the lar.e one is hurled in an instant from the top to the bottom, sweeping, before it with irresistible foree everything that tends to interrupt its course. The hill is a position of some importance, as it commands the high road to Shiraz from ’ Arabist's n and Behbehan. The rock runs from north-west to south-east and is com posed of limestone, on all sides very preci pitous, but least so towards the west. There is abu dance of oak and other trees on its summit, and plenty of water but no habitations. To the north runs the Talag n branch of the Tab river, nearly in a north-west direction. There are four principal entrances to the fort, which face to the north-east, south-east, west and south-west; these are approached by very difficult and stony paths liable to have masses of rock thrown on them from above. Even in the present state of the neighbouring roads, guns might probably be brought with great labour near enough to the west entrance to cover an attacking party from a lower height close to it called the Shutur Khwab ; at all events a road could be constructed for that purpose, but the capture of the fort n this manner, which must be attended with considerable loss, seems a matter of doubtful impor tance provided it could be stiictly block aded ; as its surrender, if shut out from the surrounding country, must soon follow from want of supplies. The Fahlian river, on the bank of which 1 itstands, ishere 18 yards wide and 3 feet deep, running with a rapid current. Just by the hills it is joined by the Shal stream from the north, the main stream from the east being here called the Tang-i-Khast, from a narrow gorge through which it flows.284 Name, Lat. Long.

SIAKH.— A hilly district S. of Shiraz, consisting of a long valley parallel to the Shiraz plain and separated from it by a high mountain range. It is bounded on the N. by the Shiraz district, on the E. by Kavar, on the S. by Khwajai and Jirreh, on the W. by the Mamassani country (?) or Kuhmarreh. The estimated sedentary population is about 3,000. The whole district is under Qashqai influence, and the villagers are fair fighting men, who send large contingents to the Qashqai when called on to do so. The district includes the following villages :— Name. Lat. Long. Notes. o / O / Aiur 29 25 52 25 Baba Aiur 29 23 52 26 Baraljan •• Darreh 29 13 52 37 : T - Deh Bal Deh Slnb .. ..

The bay deepens regularly from the coast to 8 fathoms at | mile off-shore. The village is built partly on the shore and partly up the side of the coast range behind it, which is here 700’ high. A square fort stands on a hill at the W. end, about 100' above sea level. There are about 150 stone houses inhabited by Arabs and Persians of various tribes ; the Arabs are in the majority and are Shaf’i Sunnis, the Per sians being Shi’ahs. The estimated population is about 1,000. Water is from wells, about 3 fathoms deep, and there are about 350 date palms besides cultivation of wheat and barley. Tahiri is the port of the Galehdar and Jam districts, immediately behind the maritime range, with which it is connected by passes fit for donkeys, but scarcely so for camels or horses. Livestock comprises 10 horses, 50 donkeys, 500 cattle, 100 sheep. The chief exports are tobacco and charcoal from Galchdar, wheat and firewood from Jam and salt fish from the neighbouring ports. The people of Tahiri are merchants, sailors, fishermen, pearl-divers and cultivators; the first three named^classes are also smugglers: they own about 6 trading sambuqs, which run to Oman and Basrah as well as to Gulf ports, and four fishing 'amilehs. In the neighbourhood is a small cape called Has Majnun, off which is a pearl- bank. In 1904. friction between Jamal Khan of Dashti and Sulaiman, the local Nasuri Shaikh, occurred, with the result that the Shaikh fled to Shiyu and Chiru, followed by many of his adherents with their families. There is a post of Imperial Customs, to which revenue is now (1911) paid, and which is responsible for the preservation of order, with the assistance of the Governor of the Gulf Ports. The present revenue demand (1911) is 1 000 Tumans per annum. The hills inland of Tahiri, at a distance of from 3 to 6 miles from the place are said to be occupied by a Baluch tribe, who possess a quantity of livestock ’ chiefly sheep and goats; also a few date-palms; they cultivate wheat' barley and maize. The only claim of Tahiri to distinction is the possession of prehistoric remains and early Muhammadan ruins. The sides of the ravines which come down from the hills to the north-west of the village are pierced with numerous chambers, most of which are inaccessible, except by ladders • and in one place the hillside over a space of half a mile square has been worked into tiers of remarkable troughs. This portion is intersected bv a ravine, to which a flight of broad shallow steps, cut in rough conglomerate rock, descends on either side. Here and there pillars of natural rock have been'left standing, and the largest of these has been hollowed out to form a chamber. There are many wells m the hillside, one of which is 204 feet deep and contains 36' of good water; some of these wells are circular, some oblong, and the diameter is usually 2 or 3 feet; those furthest up the hill are the deepest. These remains are apparently pre-Islamic; the chambers appear to have been sepulchral, and some of them m 1857 still contained crumbling human the C ° ast P lain immediately west of Tahiri are the ruins of the early ihammadan towns of Siraf, extending for a mile or more along the coast290 • and for some distance up the slopes of the foothills. These are now mere • heaps of rough masonry, but foundations of houses, wells and the remains of water-cisterns of the pattern still common on this coast—oblong excavations with gypsum-cement and vaulted over—are still traceable. The whole ex tent of the ruins is strewn with broken pottery including many fragments of Chinese porcelain. The only building in a state of moderate preservation is a mosque of well-cut stone and elegant design with pointed doors and win dows. One traveller believes it to have been originally a Christian building, subsequently adapted to Muhammadan uses ; some of the decorative carving appears from his account to have been of floral character. There are many ornamental monolithic tomb-stones bearing cufic inscriptions : one of these, now in the British Museum, bears a date equivalent to 991 A.D. Ibn HaukaTs ancient geography, 10th Century, translated by Sir W. Ouseley, states that Siraf is on the coast of Ears, and that fruits, etc., were brought to it from a mountain on the E. of the city called Jam. The mention of Jam in this connection, the fact that to this day caravans of fruit are constantly passing down the passes from Jam to Tallin in the season, and the numerous ruins of very old sarais, and traces of an ancient made road prove clearly that the Tahiri is identical with Siraf. Communications. —Two execrable tracks lead from Tahiri to the interior— to Jam and Galehdar: one via, Puzeh Padri, a hill so named from the village of Padri at its foot, and one via Kal-i-Chashmeh to the E. of the port; the first named is in common use and is the easier of the two, though both alike are difficult for any animals but donkeys. The present chief of Tahiri is Shaikh Hatim Khan, a man of about 25 years of age. The inland boundary of Tahiri, which is one of the Shlbkuh ports, is in dispute, but it does not extend to the crest of the maritime range, HirmI, half way to Jam, being subordinate to the latter. The following coastal villages were subordinate to Tahiri in 1911 :— Mialu, ’Aianat or Tunbak, Akhtar, Bagh-i-Shaikh, Ras-ash-shajar, Shllau ; details of these places will be found under “ Shlbkuh ports.” Bagh-i-Shaikh counts as part of Tahiri; llas-ash-shajar has been deserted since 1904, Shllau is 4 miles W. of Tahiri. 214. TANGISTAN.— This district of the coast of Ears is somewhat irregular in shape: its maxi mum length from N. to S. is about 40 miles, and the N. half has a breadth of about 20 miles : the S. half is merely a narrow strip along the coast. Tangistan, as at present composed, includes localities formerly separate entities, such as Samal and Ahram, and the Khaviz valley. The last named is the only portion in the mountains, and outside the coast plain : the Tan- gistanl chiefs, its purchasers, have brought it under Tangistan proper. The 'present boundaries of the district are on the— West —the Mashileh from near the caravan route to its end, then along the sea-coast to Karri.291 South -from this point to the hills behind (which separate it from inland Dashti) and northwards, along the crest of these hills, to a gully flowing out past Kulul, a little to the north ; south of Bagh-i-Abdul to the mountains north of the Kuh-i-Bairami. North —from the Masluleh, south of the caravan road, south of Chag’ a- dak, north of ’All Changl, then east of Chahkutah and north westwards till it meets the Burazjan border : west of Bulfaiis and Gandumriz : th.m turning eastwards, north of Gulangun, along a low range of hills till it reaches the Tang-i-Haft Mulla. AW—southward along the range cf coast mountains, past the Kuh-i- Dukhtar, the entrance of the Tang-i-Wahush, then along the range to east of the Khaviz valley, south of Muhadu and Ashi. A low range of hills separates the villages on the sea coast from the rest of Tangistan. Physical characteristics.—Th.?, groat maritime range, where it adjoins Tan gistan. is of no great elevation, the highest point being Kuh-i-Dukhtar just under 4,000 , a few miles of Ahram, A spring of very hot sul phurous water is said to issue from the face of this lull. An important feature of the d.strict proper is the Ahram stream, which has its exit from the hills on the south side of Kuh-i-Dukhtar and, leaving the town of Ahram on its right bank, runs N.-W. and joins the Chahkutah stream of the Dashtistan district a few miles above the point where the latter empties itself into the swamps near the Bushirc town. A short way below Ahram town this stream has a channel of 100 yards: the breadth'of the actual stream is ordmarly 30 or so, and the depth 1', but it is liable to sudden flood. The surface of the Tangistan district would be flat and open throughout as it is m its northern part, were it not for the accident of a considerable’ sandstone range which, running parallel to the sea at the distance of a mile or two miand divides the south part of the d strict into an inland valley and a littoral tract. These three features, the inland valley the coastal The 6 ™ tira ^ 8fcr !P’ are a11 Prolonged southwards into the Dashti district.

Travelling Ts rendered dilbcult by mud m wet weather. The water of the Ahram stream is almost undrinkable and the district water-supply depends everywhere upon wells The climate and season of Tangistan resemble those of idashti. The Tangis-292 tan coast possesses no remarkable features: off the coast the tidal stream is so weak as to be often imperceptible. Population .—The population of Tangistan may be roughly estimated at 10,000 souls. The people belong to various tribes of which little is known. Among these are the Darhiru, Darshamal, Jamall, Khazaru, Kutu, and Zandabud, but they are generally mentioned in the aggregate as Tangistanis : the inhabitants of Samal and Abad are said to be immigrants, of ancient times, called Zanganeh, from the interior of Persia, and those of Tall Siah are said to be Aghayan from ’Iraq-i-’Ajam. In religion they are Shi’ahs and they speak the Persian tongue. Notwithstanding their proximity to Bushire town, they live in a rude and uncivilized state ; blood-feuds flourish among t' em and their name continues to be, in Bushire town, a synonym for lawlessness, brutality and ignorance. The houses in the villages are mostly huts of date leaves plastered with mud, but some are built with stone. Agriculture and trade .—The district is entirely agricultural and is reckon ed fertile. The chief crops are wheat, barley and dates, to which may be added water-melons and cucumbers. No accurate estimate has been formed of the livestock in the district. There is no internal and external trade, unless we reckon a small export of dates and of other fruits from the hills such as pomegranates, grapes, lemons, oranges, and citrons, and a more regular export of locally manufactured gach. The currency consists of ordinary Persian Krdns, and the unit of weight throughout the district is a Hdshim man which is equal to 17 or 18 Tahrz mans, of Bushire and is consequently, somewhat heavier than the Hdshim man of Bushire town. Communication and Transport. —No routes of importance traverse the district. The journey from Ahram to Burazjan presents no difficulties. No cal culation has been made of the transport of the Tangistan district. Administration .—Tangistan belongs properly to the government of Pars; but it is now nominally under the control of the Governor of the Gulf Ports. Ahram, the Khaviz valley and Samal are properties of Nizam-us-Saltaneh (being farmed for about 6,400 Tmndns in 1911): but the grant was made by the government in Tehran irrespective of the rights of ownership possessed by the Khans of Tangistan themselves in the date gardens of Ahram The mdlidt of the rest of Tangistan is 2,500 Tumdns. The incidence of the land-tax is nominally 20 to 60 Krdns per harvest on the gdu of cultivation; on each date-tree an annual impost of 33 cents is levied and a poll-tax also is payable by each male adult at the rate of 20 to 40 Krdns. In Tangistan there is no pretence of government, and even the rudimentary civil justice, which in other districts is dispensed by the religious authorises does not exist—a deficiency which is attributed to the backward condition of the people and their intractable character. For 40 years at least the ordinary residence of the ruling family has been at Ahram, but it was originally at a village called Tangistan, whence the name of C361GSB 9p293 the district; Tangistan village is said to have lain about 5 miles south of ’Ali Changi and the remains of it to have been swept away by a flood (1905). The town of Ahram is described as a comparatively recent acquisition of the Khan’s familv, so also Khaviz, Abad and Samal in the district of Dashtistan; these were all formerly in the hands of the Mashaikh-ul-Mazkur, whose power fell into decay some years ago. At the time of the British war of 1856, when the Tangistanis put up a brief resistance, their district was in the undivided control of Baqir Khan. For much longer, however, they had been notorious for their inroads into Bushire (the outskirts of the town and the island being from time to time raided by them). After Baqir Khan’s death the district got gradually out of the control of its own chiefs. For a time the famous Muhammad Khan of DashtI ruled it: subsequently Hasan Khan, son of Baqir Khan. Haidar Khan, a nephew of the above, was kept a prisoner at Shiraz for many years (previous to 1890). After bis return he and his cousin ’AH Khan ruled alternately, but weakly and badly; and several Kr.dkhudas made themselves practically independent, including a certain Kadkhuda of Baghak, Haji Muhammad ’Ali. Mai atwaa not paid, and the Khans, in bad odour with the people, were finally diiven out through the Daria Begi’s championship of Zair Khidar, son of the above-named Kadkhuda of Baghak. This man originally agreed to act as Kaldntar of the district, under the Khans, got together the and finally dispossessed the Khans. From 1905 onwards, Zair Khidar and the various Kadkhudas each remained supreme in his own village or surroundings, the most notable being Hasan Bakshu in Ambarak, Ghulam Husain Haji Khidar in Shuraki, Kais ’Ali in Dilvar. The Khaviz valley and Ahram were farmed by Zair Khidar, who amassed money, but was very lenient. In 1911 Nizam-us-Saltaneh rejected Zair Khidar’s overtures, having with him in his suite some of the younger Tangistani Khans. Zair Khidar was attacked by a force of the Nizam, beaten back to the hills and his village Shamshiri destroyed. Sharp fighting ensued, in which some of the Kad khudas like Hasan Bakshu took the part of the Khans: Baqir Khan, Baha- dur-us-Saltaneh was killed, but old Haidar Khan went back to Ahram with the other Khans on Nizam-us-Saltaneh’s behalf. They remained in power as long as Nizam was Governor-General, but in October Zair Khidar attacked them in the fort of Qalat and, as their supporters melted away, they were forced to fly the district. Muwaqqar-ud-Dauleh, the new Governor, put Zair Khidar in charge of all Tangistan, and they maintained friendly relations. The other Kadkhudas are by no means subordinate to Zair Khidar, though Zair Khidar can raise the most men. Rais’All of Dilvar has become rich, and therefore of some importance, through successful smuggling. The number of tufanqch s in Tangistan is altogether perhaps 1,000, but there are so many blood-feuds and enmities that more than 300 would most unlikely be found together. At the time of Saiyid Murtaza’s introduction of the Tangistanis into Bushire, in 1909, 1,000 men were sr.id to have col lected, but the number was really much less, and then they were attracted by the prospect of loot.294 The family of the Khan is of Arab origin, belonging to a tribfi called Fulad, but is now completely Persianised. The following is a table of the Khan’s immediate ancestors :— AHMAD SHAH KHAN. Muhammad ’All Khan, (killed at Bushire about 1834 by the Khan of DashtI). Ahmad Shah Khan (killed in the Anglo-Persian war, (died 1871). (died 1894), (about 56). (died at Karbala Khan (28). Khan (30). Khan.

ZAlDlN.— A plain and district subordinate to Behbehan : it is enclosed by a ran&lt;re of low hills, and well-watered by the Hindian, from which numerous canals and water-courses are also derived. The land, devoted principally to rice fields, is very fertile. Cham Zaidan is the principal village. Zaidan is bounded to the S. by another range of sandstone hills, steep to the W., but to the E. little above the level of the plain of Zaidan. The district is for the most part owned by the Bakhtiari Khans, but the Shaikh of Muhammareh has large holdings, and has in addition lent large sums to the Khans on the security of their lands. The following villages are situated in or near the plain, the sedentary population of which is estimated at 3,000. Some 500 donkeys are available for trasport:— Name. Lat. Long.

Zird is bounded on the — If'e.^ ; by the Shahpur river. East: by the Daliki river. North: boundary is south of Siah Mansur and Mazaral up to the foot of the mountains. On the east the district also marches with that of Daliki, from between Bibara and the Daliki date-groves, west of the river, down to the south-west of Sarkavardiin in Daliki territory. The district lies close under the hills and the heat in summer is great. Dates and some cotton are grown, but the principal crops, as in the neigh bouring districts, are wheat and barley. The inhabitants are a medley of Persian-speaking tribes, all of whom are Shi’ahs ; their number is estimated at 4,000 souls. The men are well-armed with rifles and knives and revolvers are worn. Agricultural produce is the only export and imports are the same as in the other small districts near Bushire. The Hdshim man of Zira is r C361GSB 2 q( 306 ) APPENDIX II. Mineral Resources of Fdrs.

It had 30 wretched huts, and a solitary tower, with a not over abundant supply of brackish water. The name of the place means “ stone ” in Turkish from the fact of there being lead mines there. There are so-called works there. The lead seams run parallel to the general strike of the hills. It is found both in the form of an oxide and associated with copper. It is reduced to a metallic state by pulveiisation, washing, and heat ing in a blast furnace, all of which opera- tions are performed in the most primitive manner. The refuse copper ore is thrown away, as the miners are not acquainted with the manner of reducing it to a metal lic state. There are about 40 miners here. The yearly output is about 4,500 maunds, of which one-sixth is levied as a tax by the Fare Government. The Mashhad Murghab district is said to contain lead mines. Vide page 222.
