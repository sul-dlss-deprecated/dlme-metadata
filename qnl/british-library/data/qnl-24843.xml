Many thanks for your personal letter No * Pol* Ext. 16501/48 of the 3rd July, 1948, regarding my~claim for'the refund of my wife's passage to Bahrain. I am very glad to receive the £ 65 and am most grateful to you for all the trouble you have taken over the matter. I hope to arrive in the United Kingdom on the 31st July and will endeavour to look you up in the first week of August before 1 go to Ireland. F.A.K. Harrison, Esquire.

Dear Harrison, Please refer to your letter Pol. (sxt. )U09/1]!8' &gt;™— dated the 8th June, 1948 about Sir Rupert Hay*s claim for refund of the expenses of his wife’s passage to Bahrain. We are quite willing to admit Sir Rupert Hay’s claim, provided that Lady Hay intends to remain with him at the post until the end of his term of duty, i.e. to return to Bahrain after leave this summer, but only within the cost of a sea passage, which is £ 65 . We feel that the expense of an air passage cannot be justified as a charge to public funds in view of the fact that Sir Rupert Hay’s daughter was already with him and was able to act as his hostess. Incidentally, had Lady Hay travelled by sea there would have been no charge in respect of extra baggage and we consider this claim should be disallowed. Yours sincerely. (S.H. Anstey) • P.A.K.

Hay, 'ajfethe Persian Oulf* regarding a claim in I’sifessag* from the U.K. to Bahrein at t the is you are aware. Sir H* Hay’s contract of service /e with the Foreign Office but the cost was borne on the C.H.O. vote up to the end of the financial year on 31st March. It wcaild, I think, be correct that his present claim should be decided in accordance with Foreign Service Regulations. It should be mentioned that air passages to Bahrein in October last were sanctioned for Sir R. Hay and his daughter, it being represented that his daughter’s presence would be of assistance in keeping house for him. As you will see frem the enclosed letter. Lady Hay postponed her own departure for doaestio reasons until January 30th. In these oircunstanoes the point for consideration is whether the full cost of the air passage should be met on the grounds that it was necessary for official purposes that she shaild travel by air or whether only the cost of a sea passage would be admissible. I should be grateful if you would advise me hew you would treat such a claim if you were dealing with it in foreign Office under Foreign Service Regulations. * Tours sincerely, F ‘ ' K.

I enquired about this before I left the United Kingdom and was advised to put the question up when it arose. 2 . On my coming out here to take up my appointment under contract with His Majesty's Government I was entitled to free passages by air for myself and members of my family accompanying me. I understood that the phrase ’’accompanying me” need not be interpreted absolutely literally but that a free passage would be granted for any member of my family joining me within a reasonable time and whose presence in Bahrain was likely to assist me in my official duties. I came out myself at the beginning of October and my wife did not join me until the end of January as it was necessary foiv her to make a home in the United Kingdom during the Christmas holidays for my four children who are being educated at home. She now hopes to be with me here till towards the end of June and I myself hope to go to the United Kingdom on leave in the latter half of July. 3. If a claim for passage money on my wife's account is considered admissible I would ask-that the sum of £.96 on account cf a passage by air from London to Bahrain plus £.7-4 s. on account of extra baggage may be credited to my account with Messrs.
