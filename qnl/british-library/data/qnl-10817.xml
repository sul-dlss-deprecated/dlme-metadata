The items are drawn from the collection of Christiaan Snouck Hugronje and the illustration was printed by Pieter Willem Marinus Trap, the lithographic printer of the journal
                           Internationales Archiv für Ethnographie.The objects are itemised in the list of plates at the beginning of the volume. Each object is identified by a number, which refers to elements in this list. The information in square brackets has been taken from a contemporaneous essay by Snouck Hurgronje entitled ‘Ethnographisches aus Mekka’, which was published in
                           Internationales Archiv für Ethnographie, Vol. I, Leiden, 1888.They are as follows:1
                           Ghèllājah(Wasserkrug) [Water pitcher. Made of grey, porous clay with handle and spout; wooden lid. The decoration consists of teeth-like elevations and incised dashes. The vessel is filled from a large, clay barrel, which contains the water reserved for household needs, so that an amount of cool drinking water is always available. From this vessel one pours the water into smaller pitchers and from the latter into drinking vessels. Instead of lids, one probably places a thin white cloth, for the purpose of filtering the poured water.]2
                           Dōraq(Krug für Zemzemwasser) [Pitcher for Zemzemwater, made of ‘grey porous clay’, with handle. ‘In the mouth of the jug is a plug made of tree fibres, the same type used as a sponge with which to wash the body; here the material is used to filter the holy water. Hundreds of full
                           Dauraqsare to be found around the mosque and those who serve the Zemzem water pour the water from such pitchers for their customers.’]3, 5, 6
                           Schèrbah’s(Wasserkrüge) [Vase-shaped pitcher with earthenware cover. Apart from its use as a water pitcher, this vessel is used especially during the months of Ramadan in mosques at the end of a period of fasting. It is also placed before visitors to the mosque alongside a jug of Zemzem water and contains chilled water, into which fruits, especially Mulberries, are placed, so that the water tastes the same.]4
                           Ibrīq(Wasserkanne für Ablutionen) [Made of grey, porous clay. Ribs around the bell. Handle and spout. The
                           Ibrīqis filled with water and used for the purpose of ritual washing and cleaning after performing natural needs. The
                           Ibrīqis sometimes also made used for washing the hands after eating, for which most often a copper
                           Ibrīqand bowl are used.]7
                           Qullah(Wasserkrug) [Vase-shaped water-pitcher. Made of similar material to the
                           Ibrīq(grey, porous clay), decoration similar to that found on the

                           Medakk(hölzernes Einziehestäbchen, womit die
                           Dikkehin die Koulisse der Beinkleider gebracht wird) [Wooden feeding-stick. Painted in bright colours with a hole at the upper end. The ‘
                           Dikkèh’ (the [waist-]band with which the trousers are pulled together at the middle of the body and fastened) is threaded through this hole and in this way the ‘
                           Dikkèh’ is in turn threaded into the

Near to the edge a row of brass pins with large, round heads, such as those found in the centre of the base on the inside. Meccans drink out of such bowls often, in so far as they don’t pay homage to the ‘new style’ of glass dishes.]The number ‘19’ appears erroneously adjacent to two of the objects, at right and left, while ‘9’ is omitted. A note at the foot of the itemised list of plates explains that the ‘19’ on the left is an error and should refer to number ‘9’.Inscriptions:Printed above image, in ink:XXXVIIPrinted beneath image, in ink:Lower right corner: ‘ex. coll. auct.’Lower left corner: ‘P.W.M.
