In your letter you say that you only accepted your present appointment to please His Excellency the British Minister and at his special request. We are well aware of this. The object of your appointment was, however, that you should, by what ever means possible, ensure the safety of the Bakhtiari road and your present attitude constitutes a danger to the security of the road and is therefore the cause of the greatest anxiety to His Excellencv the Minister^nd the British Government. They are anxious to see the fulfilment of your promises and assurances. You are well aware that difficulties arise in all administrative affairs and such difficulties can only be removed gradually and by the exercise of patience. When as in the present case—these difficulties are due to family relations the exercise of patience and restraint is specially necessary to smooth them over.2 Since His Excellency the British Minister has given you assurances of his support, and has further given you a proof in the matter of Amir Mujahid, it is ' advisable for you to refrain from any further discussion to please His Excellency and to allow time for action to be taken with the object of removing the diffi culties. r It is for you to do as you consider best. Your telegram for His Excellency the British Minister has been despatched through the Persian Telegraph Office. I will communicate to you any reply received. * ■ * * * * « * (Sd.) A. GREY.

I am extremely obliged to you for your kindness and am glad to hear of your welfare. In your letter you were kind enough to refer to the favours and kindness of His Excellency the British Minister and also to give me some friendly advice. I quite realize the truth (of what you said) and am greatly obliged. Insha Allah, I will leave for Chighakhur tomorrow the 1st Sha’aban. I will not allow the least change to take place in the orderly government of this country nor will I allow the safety of the road to be endangered and 1 will not fail in my duties while I am in this country 1 will never abandon my task even if it costs me all my personal property.

Translation of a letter dated Surk, the 19th Rajah 1331 (24th June 1913) from Sirdar-i-Jang to Captain A. Grey, Ispahan. I have received your letter in reply to mine. I was glad to hear of your welfare and much obliged for your remembrance. Thank God I am safe and at my home at Surk. You wrote about His Excellency the British Minister’s regard for me, this and the copy of his telegram pleased me very much and I am greatly obliged to His Excellency for his kindness. You know very well that if it were not for His Excellency the British Minister I would never have accepted this appointment even if the whole Bakhtiari and Chahar Mahal country had been added to my personal property. It was only to please His Excellency the British Minister that I accepted the appointment. No doubt you have heard to what trouble I have put myself since my arrival in Bakhtiari to keep order in Bakhtiari country and to keep the road open. I have recovered and delivered to the owners, whatever property belonging to2 - Lynch, muleteers and others was looted during the last two years and dealt with . •the robbers as was necessary. NASIR BAKHTIARI. ENCLOSURE A. I sent by special messenger the cover written by you to Amir Mujahid and it has been delivered to him. I had also written to him a letter to which he sent a reply and at the same time acknowledged receipt of your cover. The removal of Amir Muiahid alone will not remove all obstacles. The defects are not one, two, ten, a hundred, or a thousand that they may be count ed and remedied. At present it is essential that the Senior Khans should immediately appoint a (temporary) Governor for Bakhtiari and Chahar Mahal so that I may come to Ispahan and discuss the necessary points with them by telegraph. If a Governor is appointed he will keep the Bakhtiari country^ and environs in order and the road open. As at present there are some Tebi and Bahmai Chiefs as hostages with me, it is necessary that some one should look after them so that the road may' continue in its present condition till I go up to Ispahan and discuss matters by telegraph with the Senior Khans and the ques tion about the Bakhtiari Governorship be settled. I beg you will kindly communicate the above facts to His Excellency the British Minister and ask him to take early steps regarding the appointment of a Governor for Bakhtiari. NASIR BAKHTIARI. Enclosure B. When I was at Malamir I despatched two sowars to the Dushman Ziari and Boir Ahmedi Khans and invited them to Chighakhor so that they might come and undertake that their tribes should not commit robberies in future. Failing their obedience l warned them that I would myself lead a large expedition against them. Today two of these Chiefs have come to me. I hope to make satisfactory arrangements with them that their tribes will make no further raids. Thank God there are now no others who can commit robberies. Copy of a letter, undated, from Sirdar-i-Jang, Surk, to Captain A. Grey, Ispahan. God is witness that I am a sincere friend of His Excellency the British Minister and yourself. I advise you confidentially that it is essential that one or two of the Senior Khans should come (to Bakhtiari) because there are many here who will not allow the Bakhtiari country to remain quiet and in order. ■ r So far by my own exertion and by spending money I have preserved order but now I am exhausted and have no means left and I am myself disheartened. NASIR BAKHTIARI. Translation of a telegram dated 23rd Rajah 1331 (28th June igi3) from Sirdar-i-Jang to His Excellency the British Minister, Tehran. V r ' ■ i r, 4 y' # « v /O* y V. ? J After compliments. A copy of Your Excellency’s telegram to Amir Mujahid was sent to me by Captain Grey. I am extremely obliged to you for yourkindness. The defects in Bakhtiari affairs cannot be remedied by the removal of Amir Mujahid only. God is my witness that I have taken immense trouble in this short time with the object of successfully performing the task which I undertook. Unfortun ately they (my enemies ?) make it impossible. Now I inform you respectfully, for the sake of our friendship, that the remedy is to appoint a Governor (for Bakhtiari) and send him here quickly. I will arrange for one or two of my own brothers to carry on until the new Governor arrives. If a Governor is not appointed I will be obliged to leave. It is possible that on my departure the country will become disturbed and the road be closed and people suffer losses and trouble. I frankly inform Your Excellency that I can no longer rule as I have no strength or money left. 1 have not received a dinar of the 30,000 Tumans of last year’s revenues which was promised to be paid to me. I have suffered loss in money but 1 cannot break my word and see disorder. NASIR.

It will be forwarded in original to him. You have directed that the question of the Jarrahi land and Aqih raid should be settled in Tehran. I abide by your wishes. I have repeatedly informed you that the 30,000 Tomans for the Jerrahi lands and 5,000 Tomans tor the raids on Aqih Gumar et cetera have been received by myself and Murteza Quh Khan. The money is ready and will be paid to any one you order. Settle the question wherever you wish and in whatever manner you desire. Though I tried my utmost Amir Mujahid could not be induced to remain at Behbehan. He recovered some of the current year’s revenues and left (Behbehan). He has instigated Hussein Khan Bahmai, the Boir Ahmedi an Dushman Ziari tribes and others to raid the Ram Hormuz and Jain pr 0 ! 5 ‘ ties and commit robberies on the road, i have obtained undertakings from Mohamed Hussein Khan and Mahmood Khan and from Tehi and Bahmai chiefs and others to oppose these raids to the utmost. I have obtained six hostages from Ali MuridKhan, Tebi, and from Ali Murad Khan ^d Mohamed Husse Khan Bahmai. 1 have arranged that they should guard the road from M ala ™ to SaAhun 4 h 300 tufangchis under three chiefs prevent raids on the road.

Were I to recount to you the doings of Amir-i-Mujahid it would be wearisome. He has collected a large amount of this year’s revenues and has forcibly taken possession of the Bakhus, Jadavil and Kalandeh properties and taken the deeds from the owners. After this he left for the ’ Ilaq and thinks of instig ating the young Khans to make trouble as he did last year. I beg that you will summon him to Tehran Since, however, he is unlikely to obey it is necessary that he be dealt with with tact. If he remains in Bakhtiari territory he will disturb the country completely and instigate the tribesmen to make raids and commit robberies. NASIR BAKHIIARI.

With reference to my telegram No. 16*23, dated the 9th June 1913, I have the honour to submit herewith translation of the letters from Sardar*i-Jang to my address to which reference was made therein. Translation. Letter dated 24th Jamadi-us-Sani 1331 {—goth May rgig) from Sardar-i-Jang, Malamir, to Captain A. J. H. Grey, LA., Ispahan. I received your letter in Malamir and am much obliged. It is now two days since I arrived safely at Malamir and will stay here for a few days until I have made all arrangements for the safety of the (Bakhtiari) road. I will then leave for the ' Ilaq. I hope that after my arrival in Chahar Mahal, we will be able to meet each other, as you suggest, because lam very desirous of seeing you. Closed with compliments. Enclosure A., in above letter. No doubt you are aware of the steps which I have taken and the trouble to which I have put myself with the object of keeping the caravan road open, since my arrival m the Baklitian country. It was with this object that 1 sent Amir B 1 a 1 hbe u ha j n an , d , Kuhgilu. I spent a large amount of money but in the end Amir Mujahid could not make any arrangements for the road. I after all this trouble and loss of money, have made the necssary arrange- ments by suitable means. 7 45 of thil r a Id ma j d t the kalantars of the Tebi and Bahmai responsible for the safety of this road and have obtained security from each of them and their sons are at fribertereTfrT as , hos , ta S es \ T he chiefs themselves with the heads of their homes^ffer . da y s back also in my camp and they have since left for their the road Thlv' 2 -'ll 6 h ° stages a . nd fixl 'g the wa S es °f the guards for guarding , , * , e / W1 ^} ret ^ rn again with brave and warlike tufangchis who will guard the road from Sar-rak to Shalil and not allow any raids or robberies I Tm waiting in Malamir in this hot and disagreeable weather for the arrival of these o!vp gC M S | Wh -° are , ex P ected m another seven days. As soon as they arrive I will leave Malamir and post them on the road at suitable points and will give them necessary instructions. After I reach Deh Di 2 I will make arrangelents fortufangchis from the Bakhtiari II for the Shalil-Dopulun section so that the road may remain safe and no raids or robberies occur* You will kindly inform the British Minister and assure him that I will keep the road open and safe as it has never been before. I have, however, already informed you several times and now repeat it again that if the Khans deprive me of the 30,000 Tomans to which I am entitled by my appointment, and if in addition I am forced to borrow and spend 50,000 Tomans on expeditions and pay of tufangchis for guarding the road, and am further obliged to pay compensation for raids and robberies and fines and receive no thanks or help from the British Government and also get no favourable reply from the British Minister to my telegrams regarding my rights and other affairs, it is quite clear that I cannot continue to rule in Bakhtiari territory and accept responsibility for the safety of the road. I have informed the Khans in Tehran and inform you also that they can appoint any one else they like in my place. NASIR BAKHTIARI. Enclosure B. As regards the £126 compensation for Lieutenant Bullock’s robbery about which you wrote to me in detail and also sent me a copy of a telegram from the British Minister at Tehran. Half of this amount which belonged to Sardar Muhtesham was remitted by me to him immediately I got the information about it and as for the other half which was to be paid to Samsam-us-Sultaneh, Murteza Quli Khan has under taken to pay it. They hold their property in common. As regards the ^*500 which you say should be paid to Lieutenant Bullock as personal compensation. Since I have taken over the Government of Bakh- tiaristan I have been put to great expense and have paid heavily without murmur ing. The Khans have not paid the 30,000 Tomans on account of revenues (embezzled by the young Khans) which belonged to me. I have repeatedly telegraphed to the Khans and the British Minister (in Tehran) but there has been no result. Through my endeavours to keep the caravan road open I have become in debted to the extent of 50,000 Tomans. Now I will pay this fine also. I also paid the compensation for which I was asked first, but thus (? if these demands are made upon me) I cannot rule (in Bakhtiari country) and take upon myself the responsibility for the road, l hope therefore some one else may be appointed in my place.

Jang gees on to say that “ No change, however slight, will be permitted by me to take place in regard to the ordered Government of this country, and I will continue to ensure the perfect safety of the road, and, even if my personal property is sacrificed in the endeavour, I will not abandon my task. ” It would appear, therefore, that Jang has given up his jntention of resigning his appointment.4 No. 97-334&gt; dated Camp Ispahan.

Telegram. P., No. 14, dated 18th (received 19th) June 1913. From—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Ahwaz, (Camp Ispahan). Please send following message as soon as possible to Amir Mujahid from me. ' Your attitude towards Jang has caused me utmost surprise and distress. If Jang is forced to resign owing to your action 1 will hold you responsible. *You have been summoned to Tehran by the Khans and I expect you to leave Bakhtiari country at once and to desist from any further hostility to Jang. If you do not comply with instructions of the Khans you will incur the displeasure of His Majesty’s Government.’ , No. 11-318, dated 17th June 1913. From—His Majesty's Vice-Consul, Ahwaz, (at Ispahan), To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. I have the honour to forward herewith translations of certain letters addressed to me by Sardar-i-Jang to which reference was made in my telegram No. 17-24 of to-day s date. In my reply to Sardar-i-Jang I have pointed out to him the danger of Bakhtiaristan relapsing into a state of anarchy which would be involved by a change in the Ilkhaniship at this critical time of year, and have drawn his attention to Your Excellency’s telegram to him of the 6th instant containing the undertaking of the senior Khans to expel Amir Mujahid from Bakhtiari territory and thus relieve him from the intrigues of this Chief. I have added that I am now requesting Your Excellency to urge the senior Khans to adopt a more sympathetic attitude towards him in his difficult and thankless task. Translation of a letter without date from Sardar-i-Jcingy Deh Diz ) to Captain A. J. H. Grey, LA., Ispahan. Twenty days have passed since I sent telegrams giving my resignation to their Excellencies the Khans (in Tehran) and the British Minister and begging of them to appoint and send another Chief in my place as Governor of Bakhtiari. I am now telegraphing a third time. I have definitely asked that a Governor should be appointed before the end of the current Burj (month) Jouza (21st June 1913), failing which I will not be responsible for anything and will leave Bakhtiari country. Now for the sake of our friendship I inform you confidentiallv that the Khans should appoint a Governor and I will transfer to him the arrangements I have made about the road and will hand over the hostages so that the 250 Tebi and Bahmai who are at present on the road may continue in their work and receive their wages monthly and order may not be disturbed. If the Khans do not appoint a relief or consider that I can be induced to cancel my resignation or change my mind, they are mistaken. I will be obliged to quit and in that case all the trouble I have taken and the expense to which I have been putduring the past nine months will be wasted, and it will again be necessary to expend much time and money in restoring order. If a chief is appointed in my place before my departure it is possibe that the present state of affairs will continue without any further trouble or expense, NASIR BAKHTIARI. Translation of a letter dated the 3rd Rajah 1331 (jth June igJ3)Jrom Sardar. i-Jang, Deh Diz, to Captain A. J. //. Grey, I.A., Ispahan. After Complements. I wrote to you in detail from Malamir giving you all the news of myself. After writing that letter, and as stated therein, I stayed a few days more in Malamir until the Tebi and Bahmai tufangchis arrived at Sarrak and other important points as far as Shalil, accompanied by their chiefs. I left Malamir yesterday and arrived to-day at Deh Diz. On the way I gave necessary instruc tions to the guards, informed them of the boundaries they were to guard, stowed them the positions they had to watch and fixed places for their residence. I will stay a few days in Deh Diz to make arrangements for guards to watch the Shalil-Dopulun section and having arranged everything satisfactorily will start for (’Haq). You have been informed by me that the caravan road is quite safe and that the a rangements made with the Tebi and Bahmai Khans for guarding the road are very satisfactory because they were the persons responsible for the raids and robberies on the road. Each of them has given two members of his family (sons or brothers) as hostages and they have appointed their own relatives as chiefs of the guards and accepted responsibility for the safety of the road and for this purpose have provided 250 tufangchis. They have received large sums in cash in return for their service and l have arranged for them to receive their salary from the Bridge tolls during the next four months, the payment to be made monthly in advance. It is impossible that even small robberies or raids should now take place on the road. Besides this l will appoint warlike Bakhtiari soldiers to look after the guarding and security of the road. I am satisfied with these arrangements and I hope that no disturbances will occur hereafter. NASIR BAKHTIARI. Enclosure A in above letters. Since the date of my arrival in Bakhtiaristan up till now I have performed my duties under my appointment, maintained order throughout for the happiness of the people, kept the caravan road open and safe, hired labourers to repair the road (which is nearly complete) and paid them money, and never hesitated to carry out my duties even if expense and loss was involved in doing so, with the result that the road, the Bakhtiari territory, Chahar Mahal, Behbehan and Kuhgilu are all in order. Notwithstanding my endeavours some difficulties have made their appearance in my work and hereafter I will not be able to carry on my duties. I therefore considered it better to resign and have already telegraphed to their Excellencies the Samsam-us-Sultaneh, Sardar Assad and Sardar Muhtesham urging them to appoint a Governor (Ilkhani) soon and allow me to leave Bakhtiaristan and go to Ispahan or Tehran for treatment as I am not keeping good health. I have notified my resignation to His Excellency the British Minister also. I am thinking of staying in Deh Diz until I receive replies to my telegrams. I am now sending a special sowar to Ispahan, and am sending instructions (to my agent) to remind the Khans to give me their reply and send it when receivedby the sowar so that I may be free of my anxiety. I cannot rule in this country with such difficulties. It was necessary to inform you also so that you may be aware. NASIR BAKHTIARI. P.S .—Since evil conduct (intrigue) has become the nature of the younger Khans of this family and they cannot be cured of it by any means it is needless for me to discuss this subject. I can only ask for pardon and express regret that I can no longer rule and maintain security and am therefore obliged to leave. My pride does not allow me to ] put up with these things. I will inform you personally in detail when we meet. NASIR BAKHTIARI.

You may rest assured that I wall support you in your difficult task. I have made pressing recommendations to their Excellencies the Sardar Assad and Samsam-us-Sultaneh and they have assured me that they will remove Amir Mujahid from Bakhtiari territory blgf persuasion, if possible, but if necessary, by force. I will see that this is done? You may rest assured of my strong support in your endeavours to secure the safety of the road to which question the British Government attach great importance. I hope you will inform me occasionally of your health and also give me news of your affairs.

LORD RONALDSHAY called to-day and said he had been authorised by Sir E. Grey to see me with reference to Mr. Lynch’s grievances. Mr. Lynch had asked him to ascertain whether the Foreign Office had any prejudice against him. I said I would be quite frank with Lord Ronaldshay, and I read him accounts of the several interviews with Mr. Lynch’s solicitors, and the attached Library memorandum, dated the 21st July, 1913, about the Bakhtiari roads. Lord Ronaldshay said he realised that the feeling against Mr. Lynch had been as strong in Lord Lansdowne’s time as it was now; that he would advise Mr. Lynch to come to terms on the basis of the 19th May, 1913, memorandum; and that he would say he could add nothing to what the solicitors had been told already. He also said he would cease to support Mr. Lynch’s exorbitant claims. A. P. Foreign Office, July 22, 1913. I approve Mr. Parker’s action. I believe Lord Ronaldshay can be trusted to take information given to him fairly and on its merits. In a memorandum on the memorandum and articles of association of the newly-formed Persian Transport Company, bir T. Sanderson said,^ in 1903, Our experience of Messrs. Lynch has not been altogether satisfactory (memorandum, 14th April, 1903), and in a note to Mr. Davidson respecting the same documents he stated, “Their fault is that they” (i.e., Messrs. Lynch) “are cantankerous and grasping ” (note with draft to Messrs. Lynch, 16th April, 1903). In May 1903 the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company wrote a long letter in support of certain charges which they had made for the repair of the Ispahan-Ahwaz road, those charges being objected to by the Bakhtiari chiefs as excessive. In a memorandum dealing with the company’s letter, which he characterised as “ of a most unsatisfactory nature, being in Mr. Lynch’s worst style, and requiring some plain speaking in its reply,” Sir C. Hardinge dealt with the points which had been raised by the company. The memorandum was incorporated in a reply to the company, the substance of which was as follows : (a.) The company had claimed 3,817 krans for expenses incurred by their representative on a journey from Ahwaz to Ispahan and back. No mention was made in Messrs. Lynch’s contract with the Bakhtiari chiefs ol the 3rd March, 1898, of the chiefs being in any way liable for expense of inspections, their only liability being for cost of repairs “ such as the concessionnaires cannot execute themselves” and carried out under the superintendence of Messrs. Lynch s engineers. In this case no such repairs were executed, and consequently no valid claim could (b.) The company maintained a claim for S,500L for construction of the bridges According to the contract of March 1898 Messrs. Lynch undertook to execute the works for a sum not exceeding 5,500b, a figure agreed to by Messrs. Lynch themselves and afterwards communicated by their agent to the Bakhtiari chiefs. Under those L. M. A. N. E. D. A. E. G. Bahhtiari Roads : Strictures on Messrs. Lynch. [2985 y — 2 ] 1 S2 circumstances the refusal of the chiefs to pay the instalments and interest computed on the basis of the higher initial outlay was intelligible, and His Majesty’s Government could not assist in any way in pressing the claim upon them. Nor would it be possible for His Majesty’s Government to press for interest at the rate of 12 per cent, on the arrears, since, under the terms of the contract, the chiefs agreed to pay Messrs. Lynch 6 per cent, per annum on their outlay. (To Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, 15 May, 1903). In June 1906 Mr. Lynch wrote privately to Sir E. Grey, enclosing a copy of a letter which he had addressed to Mr. Morley (then Secretary of State for India) proposing that steps should be taken jointly by the Foreign Office and the India Office to furnish, through the Persian Transport Company, money for a loan to the Bakhtiari chiefs, Sir C. Hardinge minuted the letter, “ Mr. Morley has evidently treated Mr. Lynch’s letter with the contempt it deserves, since nothing is known of it in the Political Department of the India Office. Colonel Pi'cot called on me on Thursday, and I told him that there could be no question of this Department doing anything to facilitate a loan of 8,000Z. to the Bakhtiari chiefs to squander as they please. There is no end to Mr. Lynch’s demands. Only three years ago we paid him 4,000L to start the Transport Company, and now more is wanted of us.” (18823, File 2479/06). In sending home an account of a meeting which he and Mr. Malleson (Messrs. Lynch’s agent at Tehran) had had with the Bakhtiari khans, for the purpose of dis cussing various questions connected with the Ispahan-Ahwaz road, Mr. E. Grant Duf (see his No. 131, Confidential, of the 20th May, 1906), made the following statements “ I regret to say that the chiefs made no secret of their dislike of Messrs. Lynch.” “He” (Sardar Assad, who acted as spokesman for the chiefs) “maintains that the accounts of the road given to His Majesty’s Government by Messrs. Lynch are exaggerated.” “I wish clearly to bring out the fact that the Bakhtiaris, rightly or wrongly, distrust Messrs. Lynch.” “ But they fairly loathe Messrs. Lynch.” Sir C. Hardinge’s comment on the despatch was : “ Unfortunately Messrs. Lynch have made themselves thoroughly detested by the Bakhtiari chiefs by 'their exorbitant demands.” (19,817, File 2479/06). On a paper dealing with the proposed visit of two Bakhtiari chiefs (Haji Ali Hub Khan and Haji Khosru Khan) to Europe in 1907, Sir C. Hardinge wrote, “ When I was in Tehran 1896-8 the Bakhtiari chiefs were in very close relations with the British Legation and Hadji Ali Guli Khan was a firm believer in ever} 7 body that was English. Thanks to Mr. Lynch all this has been changed and the legation is now no longer in touch with the chiefs.” (3615, File 2209/07). In March 1908 the Persian Transport Company wrote, “ We are not aware of any personal ill-will on the part of the chiefs against the directors of this company, except in so far as Haji Ali Kuli Khan may have a grievance in the matter of certain loans desired by him in 1901 and 1906.” Mi. Norman s comment on that was : “ The company may not be aware of any ill-will on the part of the khans towards any individual directors, but we know that the khans hate Mr. Lynch.” (9757, File 5122/08).

They have received a portion of their pay in advance, and it has been arranged that the sums required for their future payments will be taken out of the receipts on account of Bridge Tolls. These arrangements would appear to be most satisfactory and provided they continue to be carried out effectively, there should be little danger of organised raids being attempted by the Kuhgilus. He goes on to say that he has several times formally tendered his resigna* tion to the Tehran Khans by telegraph, and has requested them at the same time to send the Chief who is to succeed him in the Ilkhaniship. He has intimated to them his intention of disclaiming all further responsibility of Government, and of quitting Bakhtiari territory, if the Khans do not announce the appointment of his successor by June 21st. Beyond mentioning certain difficulties, ill health and some trouble with the Young Khans, he does not clearly state the reason for his desire to throw up the appointment. In my opinion Jang is not threatening to resign purely in the hope that the Khans may thereby be induced to recover for him the 3o,ooo Tomans embezzled by the Young Khans out of the Revenues of last year. No doubt Jang has communicated further details of his grievances to the Khans in Tehran, and in view of the good work which Jang is doing Your Excellency may possibly see your way to urging them to adopt a more generous attitude towards him.

It is rumoured that former two have combined against Jang. That Mujahid is not on friendly terms with Jang is old story, but it is very doubtful whether Murteza has joined with former whom all the Khans despise. Since failure of Ktihgelu expedition I have been strongly of opinion that road will be closed again this year, but robberies cannot take place until Jang and tribesmen have arrived at llaq. I strongly advise cessation of forwarding until Jang arrives and it is seen what arrangements have been made if any for the safety of the road. Telegram P., No. 4-21, dated 4th June 1913. From—His Majesty's Consul, Ahwaz (Ispahan), To—His Majesty's Minister, Tehran. (Repeated Political Resident). The situation in Chahar Mahal is rapidly assuming a most unsatisfactory aspect, and there is every prospect that the disorders of last year will be repeated. The tactics previously employed by Mujahid have again been resorted to by him and with a view to destroying Jangs authority and rendering his position untenable, he is forming a young Khan party and trouble is being fomented by him between the tribesmen of the Ilkhani and Haji llkhani factions. Through shock caused to the mother by a raid 5 on Surk, carried out by one of Mufakham’s sons, the death has occurred of Sardar Jang’s infant son. This raid is believed to have been investigated by Mujahid. Sardar Jang, in telegrams which are being despatched to Tehran from here today, brings an accusation against Mujahid to the effect that the latter, before he left Behbehan instigated some Kuhgelu tribes to carry out raids, as soon as he (Jang) left for the north, on the Bakhtiari frontier and road. Sardar Jang states that he has arranged for the guarding of the road with the Tebi and Bahmai, but adds that if Mujahid continues to remain in Bakhtiari country and carries on intrigues against him, the arrangements that he has made will be of no avail. Mujahid, he urges, should be summoned to Tehran by the Khans. When Jang’s telegrams were communicated to me by Sardar Ashjaa, the latter requested me to beg Your Excellency to urge upon the Khans the neces sity for Mujahid’s removal from Bakhtiari territory. In view of the fact that Mujahid has proved a failure in Behbehan and that he has now set himself to oppose Jang actively, it is most desirable, in my opinion, that he should be removed. By his presence in Chahar Mahal the last hope that the road will remain secure this hot weather is removed.

With reference to my telegram No. 172. After exercising considerable persuasion I have succeeded in inducing the Khans to say that, provided the Shaikh pays them 40,000 instead of 30,000 tomans and that he remits the money direct to Tehran, they will accept the arrangement made between him and Sardar Jang. Ten thousand tomans is still being claimed as compensation for Aqih by Sardar Muhtasham, but l think that, with some persuasion, he would probably accept ^ 000 if (1) the money is sent direct to Tehran and (2) 11 it is made clear that Jang can claim no part of this sum as compensation for imaginary damage caused, two or three years ago, to some of his villages. I do not think it will be possible to extract more equal terms from the Khans the loss of whose goodwill in my opinion it is important not to risk, greatly hope that you may see your way to get the Shaikh to accept this com promise by bringing pressure to bear on him. The Zil-es-Sultan’s defection to the Russian Camp, a fact which is testified to by his recent action in handing over all his property in Ispahan to be looked after by the Manager of the Russian Bank, under conditions which will probably involve the direct mterference of the Russian Government in certain circum stances, goes to show that even as far south as Ispahan people are beginning to realise that friendly relations with the Russian authorities will serve them best in the long run. It is quite possible that this deal, which the Bakhtians are fully aware has taken place, may appear to them as an example worthy of emulation. As the Bakhtiari may prove in the future to be a valuable bulwark for us, the retention of their allegiance is in my opinion a very important matter and have no doubt that were the Bakhtiari to transfer their allegiance from the Bntish to the Russian Government, even the Shaikh himself would very soon feel the effects of the change. It is on account of this that I consider myself bound to humour the Khans to a greater extent than you may think I am justified in oing. p O*EiCN 1 JULI9J3 OFFICI Telegram No. 253-881, dated the 16th May i^S- From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran.

With reference to the alleged lack of authority of Ilkhani to con- 4 elude sale of lands. In addition to Tehran Khans’ telegram 22nd March o' * which Ilkhani acted, I am given to understand that further explicit instructions were sent to Sardar Jang by qasid from Ispahan authorising sale, and that these instructions were shown to Shaikh by Ilkhani.

Sardar Muhtasham has telegraphed in similar sense regarding Aqili payment. Matters are thus under direct negotiation between the parties and there seems no reason why we should intervene unless it be to uphold the agreement. The Shaikh’s son and Haii Rais were due to leave Ahwaz about May 8th for Ramuz to meet Sardar Tamr and Arnir Mujahid in order to settle final details of present settlement which is understood to include other matters besides the two above mentioned.

In respect to the latter interests, I gather from one of Reuter’s 1 telegrams that Salar-ed~Dowlah is off the bill of fare for the time being, and regarding the probability of the Bakhtiari veering towards the Russians, it does not appear from the final sentence of your despatch to the Foreign Office of February 28th, No. 46, that the danger of such a development is regarded by you as very lively or grave.

Following from His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Ahwaz. Begins :— (1) Haji Rais informed me that when at Band-i-Qir he saw a private letter from the Khans to Jang telling the latter to do all he could to get 50,000 tomans for the lands but in the last resort to accept tomans 30,000. I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of this. (2) The Jarrahi lands were owned in the following proportions by the various Khans Samsam-es-Sultaneh ^th. Sardar Jang and Amir Mufakham jointly Jth, Sardar Muhtasham ^th. Sardar Ashjaa Jth. Sardar Assad ^-th. Sardar Zaffar Jth. All the property of Sardar Jang and Amir Mufakham is held jointly and so they cannot object to the terms. Samsam’s objection cannot be serious as all his affairs are managed by Murtaza Quli Khan. Sardar Ashjaa tells me that the Sardar Jang’s arrange ment meets with his unreserved approval. Sardar Zaffar is in Europe and cannot be a party to the present objections. There remain therefore only Muhtasham and Assad and I submit that in view of the foregoing considerations the attitude of the latter two cannot be said to voice the opinion of the majority of the Khans. tl 22 FD—44—30*5*i3—GCPB Simla-'-’•et'iry, India.

My telegram which immediately precedes this had reference to your tele gram No, 162. The Jarrahi settlement is referred to by Grey as “ preliminary, ”2 on the grounds that it cannot be considered complete until the Khans in Tehran have handed over the title deeds and deed of transfer. The executive Khans have, however, formally undertaken that this will be done. No undertakings of a sufficiently definite nature on either side to make it worth registering, are contained in the declaration of peace.

I should be glad if full information could be obtained as soon as possible from Mohammerah and Ahwaz with regard to the reconciliation between the Bakhtiaris and the Shaikh The Khans are very anxious to know what sort of agreement has been arrived at over the Jarrahi and Aqili questions. From the cryptic nature of the telegrams which they have received from Jang and Murteza they suspect that the two latter I have been bribed by the Shaikh. They say that the two Khans had no authority to conclude an arrangement of either question without reference to them and that, if they consider any arrangement unsatisfactory they will disavow it. They are capable of double dealings themselves and are inclined to credit me with like capability ; they rather suspect me of having encouraged Jang to present them with a fait accompli of an unacceptable nature. The most unfortunate results may accrue from any such arrangement having been made, as I fancy that they would not find it hard to stir up discord and create a general disturbance over the whole of the Bakhtiari country.

Confidential .—Grey has reported fully and copies of his reports enclosing copies of documents have been posted to India and yourself on 13th and igth respectively. Consul, Mohammerah, was not present at all at negotiations. Grey was on the spot but took no part in pour parlers. He merely reports proceed* ings and results. The documents executed were as follows :— . firstly. As regards Aqili. The executive Khans, describing themselves as acting as the representatives of the Sardars Muhtasham and Ashjaa and all the senior Khans, completely forego all claims as an act of grace. The Shaikh in return paid over ,S.coo tomans as a gift to the two Sardars above-mentioned, for the Sardar Muhtasham. . Secondly. As regards Jarrahi. Executive Khans describing themselves as acting on behalf of the Khans in Tehran and as their agents state that they nave entered into and completed sale and received price. In a second document in which they are similarly described, they undertake to procure the original title eeds and papers of transfer duly acquitted and signed by the senior Khans in enran. the Shaikh paid over the 30,000 tomans in due course. A third docu ment merely contains a general compact of peace in which the executive Khans describing themselves as acting for all the Khans, sw r ear eternal friendship and the signatories themselves swear to support Shaikh in fighting any Khan who attempts to break compact. ^ The documents are witnessed by the Governor General and copies given toTelegram P., No. 216-747, dated 21st April 1913. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. With reference to my immediately preceding telegram. I have the honour respectfully to remind you that your despatch No. 237, dated 20th November to the Foreign Office describes the Khans as declaring that they were ready to abide by any settlement Sardar Jang might reach. You and I both considered the prices, which have been agreed upon, fair. I think that you will also agree that no inclination has ever been evinced by Grey to show bias in favour of the Shaikh of Mohammerah. When shall we ever be able to hope for finality if the Khans in Tehran are allowed to repudiate this formal agreement? I venture to suggest that you should await the arrival of the written reports and documents. C14FD—44—9*5-*3—(X)BP SimlaNo. 1416, dated Bushire, the 4th (received 12th) May 1913.

In continuation of my letter No. 1344, dated 27th April 1913, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of the Te'egram from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, marginally Cited telegram which has Since to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, been received from His Maiestv’s Minister 7 _ y 0 at lehran, m connection with the situation in Arabistan and the Mohammerah-Bakhtiari negotiations. 2. In my letter No. 1213 *3th April, I touched upon the difficulty of our, position in the face of the conflict of interests involved, and I think the Minister’s* present telegram will serve to bear out my observations. 3. Incidentally I may mention that I am now under instructions to negotiate a suitable agreement between the Shaikh of Mohammerah and the Oil Company in connection with their desire to start boring operations in his territory. I have every prospect of having to undertake those negotiations handicapped by the attitude of the Bakhtiari Khans in Tehran in regard to the Jarrahi lands, as described by His Majesty’s Minister, and by the necessity to communicate to the Shaikh, Hakki Pasha’s reservation (in the Turco-Persian Frontier negotia tions) regarding the Khaiyin lands, which we have allowed to stand. The price paid for the Jarrahi lands by the Bakhtiaris was 15,000 tomans; the price given to them by the Shaikh, in the bargain with the Sardar-i-Jang, was double that. In addition he has had the expense of keeping up a large standing force for several weeks. Telegram P., No. 172,‘dated and (received) 25 th April 1913. From—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. With reference to your telegram No. 216-747. The general outlines to the f arrangement between the Shaikh and Sardar Jang has become known to the Khans, and they have, as I anticipated, made a formal protest against it, declar ing that it is not valid and that they will not accept it because no authority was possessed by Jang to enter into an agreement including the settlement of the Aqili claims and the sale of the Jarrahi lands. Reference is invited by you to a despatch of mine, but that despatch con cerned a special arrangement made by Rahim Khan which was not accepted by Jang, and the nature of the correspondence which has passed subsequently has been such as to supersede their previous statement that they were willing to abide by any arrangement upon which Jang might decide on these questions. His authority to do this without reference to Tehran has always been denied by the Khans, and, as far as I know he has never been authorised by them to do more than renew the lease to the Shaikh for a further period of three years. I think I made it quite clear in my telegram No. 110, dated March 17th that the most the Khans could be induced to do was to agree that the sale of the lands should be negotiated, but that it was insisted that the negotiations should take place here and that the lowest price that they would accept was 80,000 tomans. Full details of the agreement and Jang’s explanation of his conduct must now be awaited. At the present moment the Khans are very excited and use most threatening language, but I will do my best to make them carry out the bargain. Some consideration has to be shown to them, and they are a more important factor up here than perhaps is realised by you. At the present time they alone, for instance, are in a position to furnish a force which may be required in the near future as a new rebellion under Salar-ed-Dowleh may have to be quelled.

In continuation of my letter No. 70-207, dated the 2nd April 1913, I have the honour to inform you that the Shaikh returned from the meeting with the Bakhtiari Khans this morning. As already reported the Aqili question had previously been disposed of by the Shaikh making a “present” of toumans 5,000 to Sardar-i-Jang on behalf of Sardar Muhtesham. Preliminary arrangements for the disposal of the Jarrahi question have also been made, the Shaikh having paid toumans 30,000 to the Bakhtiari Khans for their share in that property. The executive Chiefs have given a receipt for the money and a recognition of the Shaikh’s * Translation attached, vide enclosne 1 . rights in the property* and have formally undertaken to obtain from Tehran the title deeds and deed of transfer, bearing the seals of the other Khans and deliver t Kid*enclosure II. themto the Shaikh.f I say preliminary arrangements as it is just possible, though I think unlikely, that the Tehran Khans may not agree to the price accepted by Jang and may deny that their loosely worded telegram constituted a power of attorney enabling him to complete the sale of Jarrahi at his discretion. Outstanding questions having been thus settled the parties executed the friendly agreement of which I attach a t Enclosure III. translation.^ It will be noticed that this agreement is a somewhat vague and colourless document of little real value but it apparently satisfies the Shaikh that he may now add at least Sardar*i*Jang and Murteza Quli Khan to the list of his friends among the Bakhtiari Chiefs. As the agreement contains no definite undertaking on either side which we could influence the parties to observe, I have thought it better not to register and thus take official note of the document. The Chiefs’ formal letter to me (enclosure VI) gives us an excuse to support the Shaikh should the Khans again adopt an unfriendly attitude towards him. Sardar-i-Jang and Murteza Quli Khan have telegraphed to the permanent Ilkhani and Ilbegi announcing the result i Translation attached, enclosure IV. of meeting the Shaikh§ and a congratulatory telegram has been despatched to the senior Khans in Tehran by the Shaikh and executive Chiefs announc- fl Translation attached, enclosure V. ^ estab l} s h me nt of friendly relations.!) I attach also translation of a formal letter from the Chiefs to me announcing the conclusion of peace and their decision to abide by it.^f ^ Enclosure VI. At the meeting the question of the El Kathir lands (which has formed the subject of a previous report) came under discussion. The Shaikly considered it politic to yield to a certain extent, outwardly, to Bakhtiari aspirations m this direction. It has accordingly been veroally agreed between them that the Shaikh should, during the current Persian year, use his best endeavours to persuade Nizam-us-Saltaneh to sell these lands. If successful in his endeavours he will re-sell a half share to the Khans but continue to administer the whole property, as at present, and pay the Khans a half share of the revenue derived from the lands. If unsuccessful the Khans will then bring their persuasive influence to bear on the Nizam with the same object in view. The Shaikh did not put this plan into writing and hopes that altered condi tions during the year will make it possible for him to avoid making goo is undertaking.

I have the honour to address you on the subject of the Shaikh-Bakhtiari relations in connection with Jarrahi and the Aqili raid. The latter question has, as reported in my letter No. 42-136, dated 7th March 1913, been closed by Sardar*i-Jang nominally agreeing to forego any claim for compensation but in reality receiving a present of tomans 5 &gt; 000 on Sardar Muhtesham’s account for the damage caused to the latter s proprety. This sum was actually paid to the Sardar by Haji Rais during their meeting at the Oil Fields. At this same meeting Sardar-i-Jang asked Haji Rais what present the Shaikh was prepared to make to the Khans in the event of all the latter agreeing to his proposal that the Jarrahi should be presented to the Shaikh. After some haggling it was decided that the Shaikh should give a return present of tomans 30,000 on this account. This promise was subsequently put into writing by the Shaikh. I have now the honour to enclose translation of a covering letter which I have addressed to Sardar-i-Jang forwarding the telegram for him from the Tehran Khans in which I asked him to notify Sardar-i-Muhtesham that the Aqih question has been satisfactorily disposed of and to complete the transfer of Jarrahi which the present telegram empowers him to do. Sardar-i-Jang is at present a guest of Ijlal-us-Sultaneh at Shushter^ and he had written to the Shaikh asking him to send Haji Rais to meet him there. Haji Rais was prevented from going to Shushter by sickness but now hopes that it will be possible to arrange a meeting at Band-i-Qir at which Sardar-i-Jang him self and the Shaikh will be present. As far as the present difficulties are concerned matters appear to be progressing favourably and I hope that the Jarrahi question will soon be as satisfactorily disposed of as the Aqili question. I have forwarded a copy of this letter to His Majesty’s Consul for Arabia- tan.3 Translation 0/ a letter dated 31st March 1913, from Captain A. J. H.

The Shaikh will, no doubt, strive to arrange that the Nizam’s answer will be unfavourable to Bakhtiari designs should he later find that he is forced to promise to act on the lines which he has proposed.

Captain prey’s remarks regarding the bitterness displayed by the Sardar- i-Jang at our action in expelling the Khans from the Cabinet and in regard to the pressure we brought to bear regarding the Jarrahi property, make the difficulty of our own position apparent. On the one hand we have our friends the Bakhtiari Khans very much “ on the make ” and naturally annoyed because our action has tended somewhat to reduce the amount of profit which they anticipated realising. On the other hand, we have our friend the Shaikh of Mohammerah, not indeed on the make, but anxious to keep what he has got intact and in tranquillity, and also annoyed because our good offices have not saved him from having to maintain an expensive standing force for the last two seasons to safeguard himself against encroachment. As neither party is fully satisfied with our support, it may be presumed that we have held the balance with reasonable impartiality. No. 66-202, dated Ahwaz, the 2nd April 1913. From— CAPTAIN A. J. H. Grey, I.A., His Majesty’s Vice-Consul and Assistant Resident, Ahwaz,, To— Lieutenant-Colonel/Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian \julf, Bushire. I have the honour to address you on the subject of the results so far attained by Sardar-i-Jang in his appointment of Governor of Bakhtiaristan and Kuhgilu and the prospects for the future. I will briefly recapitulate the steps taken by Sardar-i-Jang with the object of ensuring the permanent security of the Lynch road which have formed the subject of previous reports. The Sardar arrived in Bakhtiaristan in November, at the season when the ’ll descends to the Bakhtiari low country. He despatched 200 well armed guards to picket the road until the first snow should render it safe from Kuhgilu raids. At the same time Amir Mujahid was appointed to the Governorship of Kuhgilu and left with a small following for Behbehan. In December, the road having become safe automatically owing to the approach of winter, the road guards were withdrawn. The Amir Mujahid had, up to this time, failed to accomplish anything with the Kuhgilu tribes and it became evident that by military operations alone was there any prospect of the Amir obtaining any sort of control over the Kuhgilu. An expedition was therefore decided upon and a force was prepared and despatched in February against the Kuhgilu. I his force was divided into two columns one entering Kuhgilu territory from Qaleh Ala and the other from Behbehan. The former of these columns met with disaster, owing to the Sardar having forgotten to maintain a line of communication with its base, and the remnants of the force withdrew from the enemy’s country in March.2 The Behbehan column had met with no definite success up to the middle of March and news has now been received which leads me to the opinion that little is to be expected in this direction. It appears that a large number of the Bakhtiaris and Kuhgilus forming the column have dispersed and the remainder have been despatched to the Mamaseni country there to join hands with a Kashkai force which is reported to be operating from the east. It is thus apparent that the present military expedition has not only entirely failed in its object of striking terror into the hearts of the Kuhgilu but has encouraged the latter in the belief that they are now more than a match for their Bakhtiari neighbours. It remains to be seen whether the Sardar will carry out the assurances which he has given me to the effect that he will either himself lead another expedition against the Kuhgilu or remain at Deh Diz during the summer and organize efficient guards on the road itself to protect traffic. 1 am inclined to doubt whether the Sardar will make good either of these assurances. The season for military operations is rapidly passing, the Sardar’s hopes of financial assistance from the Persian Government have been dashed since the Khans have ceased to exercise predominating influence at the Capital and the Eakhtiari tribesmen are disheartened. The scheme to picket the road with Bakhtiari tufangchis is also not likely to be fulfilled owing to the great expense which it involves. If correct in my surmises we may expect to see the Bakhtiari road again closed from June till October and the eastern Bakhtiari frontier overrun by Kuhgilu. Although the Sardar has so far failed to carry out the work which formed the chief reason for his appointment to his present position, in another direction —that of re-establishing order in Bakhtiari territory—he has been eminently successful. Both Sardar-i-Jang and Murteza Quli Khan have expressed themselves to me as thoroughly weary of their present task and have told me openly that they intend to resign during the summer. When asked their reasons they said with great bitterness that they had received neither the support of their own Khans, the British or the Persian ! Government. The Khans, they said,^ had promised to give them a free hand and to help them to recover the Bakhtiari revenues embezzled in the early part of 1912 by the young Chiefs. They had, however, in fact not hesitated to continually issue them instructions regarding the smallest details of administration and had failed to help them to recover a single dinar from the young Chiefs. . __ ir 1 * although promising its fullest support had expelled the Khans from the Government at Tehran thereby dashing their hopes of finan cial assistance from the Capital and had not hesitated to interfere in their domestic affairs and dictate to them regarding the disposal of their family property and their relations with the Shaikh of Mohammerah. 1 hey expressed the greatest bitterness when speaking of what they considered to be our action in expelling tne Khans from the Cabinet and of the pressure we brought to bear regardingf the Jarrahi property. &amp; The Persian Government, they said, had pressed them to undertake costly military operations against the Kuhgilu but had failed to place funds at their disposal to meet the expenses of these operations. What incentive was there, they asked, for them to continue to exert them selves in the service of ourselves, the Persian Government and their relations when all alike have turned against them. Such is the attitude of the executive Khans at the present time and I think tney are sincere in their declaration that they have every intention of resigning during the present year. &amp; &amp; C7FD—44- 26-4.13—GCBP Simla.# Enclosure ,\'v.

In continuation of my former letters regarding the Bakhtiari expedition against the Kuhgilu, I have the honour to report that I have just received further news regarding the northern column under Sarum-ul-Mulk. It appears that this force which had been greatly reduced in strength by desertions was attacked by the Tebi on the night of the 15th March near Qaleh Raisi. The Bakhtiari force lost many killed and wounded and about 120 of their rifles were captured by the enemy. The Bakhtiari were much disheartened by this reverse and desertions from the force increased to such an alarming extent that Sarum-ul-Mulk decided to withdraw from the enemy’s country while there was yet time. He has reached Sar-i-Leh with the remnants of his force and is now en route to Sardar-i-Jang at Ab Bid. Sardar-i’Jang has announced that when he returns from Ab Bid he will him self raise and lead another force against the Kuhgilu. The Sardar is reported to have despatched 25 sowars and 20 tufangchis to the Godar bridge with orders to prevent the Bakhtiari II from leaving for uhe summer quarters. .to’'.'

My telegram 103-387, March 5th. Following is summary of further news from Grey regarding movements against Kuhgilu. Amir Mujahid who is still at Behbehan is reported to have taken Ali Muham mad Khan Taibi prisoner and has been sending high-coloured reports of Bakhtiari feats of arms, but whole of Taibi tribe are now in arms against Bakhtiari, who have support of Bahmai section of Kuhgilus and of a few of the Boir Ahmedi. First Bakhtiari column is reported to have been cut off from its base and to be hard pressed for supplies, and some hundreds of riflemen from it are said to have fled to their home in consequence, being robbed and stripped en route by the Kuhgilus. The southern column appears to have had no decisive engagement so far. Sardar-i-Jang appears anxious as to the outcome of the operations, as also does Grey. Telegram No. 77, dated 23rd March 1913. From—His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz. (Repeated Bushire No. 119). For some time past Bakhtiaris have been reporting movement against Boir Ahmedis on part of Amir Mujahid which has met with considerable success. These reports have been indirectly confirmed from Ahwaz, but I have always hesitated to place much credence in them, both on account of probable exaggera tion and because such energy on part of Amir Mujahid appeared to me unlikely. It is now stated by Khans that Bakhtiaris have inflicted a crushing defeat on Boir Ahmedis and are advancing on Mamasenni country with intention of ultimately attacking the Kashkuli. Government now appear to place faith in these reports, and 1 was told today by Minister of Interior that Sowlet-ed-Dowleh has arrived at Kazeroon and is prepared to co-operate on Pars side with the Bakhtiaris on Behbehan side in extermination of these brigand tribes who have been chief cause of so much disorder on the road. Before reporting to Foreign Office, I should be glad to know whether you can confirm or refute truth of these reports. Bakhtiaris claim to have an army of 7,000 men. Addressed Shiraz No. 77.

No news from Ahwaz regarding Amir Mujahid, but letter just received from reliable correspondent furnishes following information derived from one of Kashguli Khans. Amir has asked Mahomed Ali, Kashguli, to afford him help by contributing 1 an armed detachment to his force now operating against the Kuhgilu. In return for such help Amir has given his word to support and protect Mahomed Ali Khan in the matter of the Smart incident and to see that he is not pursued further in that connection. Mahomed Ali Khan has accordingly deputed his brother Hydar AH Khan with 300 men who in company with a detachment of Derashulis have joined Amir’s force. Correspondent also reports on same authority that Cheragh Khan, Kashgai, one of the adherents of Mahomed Khan, Kashguli, was with the Boir Ahmed party which attacked Eckford, and after the incident accompanied Boir Ahmed for some distance before returning to his own tents. Two or three days before informant left his camp same Cheragh Khan had started with about 30 men with the intention of raiding Shahi road north and ' south of Shiraz, giving special attention to mails in transit.

As His Honour the Nasrat-ul-Mulk has come to your High ness’s house and as all the headmen of the Bakhtiari, Arab and Kuhgilu nomads f have understood and learned that this great and honoured personage has sent his \ son to Your Highness’s house, it is becoming and desirable that you should make a gift of the Jarrahi property, by telegraph, to His Honour, who is indeed like your son. We beg especially to solicit that in view of your own magnani mity and that of His Excellency the Sardar-i-Arfa’ you should grant this small property by telegraph. We had resolved to give the deed of surrender ourselves, but as we had no permission we thought it discourteous to do so. You should especially honour us amongst the nomads by the bestowal of this favour, as it will enhance our zeal to render services. We trust that you will give a favour able answer soon. We have sent this telegram with our messenger to Bushire and pray that an answer may be granted soon, so that the man may not be delayed at Bushire. (Signed and sealed) NASIR, BAKHTIARI.

MURTEZA QULI KHAN. SARDAR-l-JANG.Telegram No. 2, dated the 13th Rabi II, 1331 (=22nd March 1913). From—Tehran to Bushire, To—His Excellency the Sardar-i-Jang and Agha Murteza Quli Khan. Your telegram concerning the affair of Jarrahi and the coming of the Nasratml-Mulk to Ram Hormuz has been received. In view of the past rela tions existing between our houses and the friendly relations between this family and the late Nusrat‘ul-Mulk, the surrender of Jarrahi will be of no importance in any way and, further, so far as family relations and friendliness are concerned, it would be easy even to surrender personal properties. But as Your Excellency is aware, neither I nor the Sardar-i-Asa’d had, or have, any displeasure with the Sardar-i-Arfa’ in any way. The only subject (under discussion) between us was the annoyance of the Sardar*i*Mutasham in regard to the plunder of Aqili, because after the agreement effected at Moham- merah by the Sardar-i-Zafar, the Sardar-i-Mutasham and Your Excellency with the Sardar-i-Arfa’ the Arabs plundered Aqili last year by order of the Sardar- i-Arfa’. Now that annoyances have been removed and a relation of amity is established, I think it is necessary that the displeasures should be com pletely dispelled and that the Sardar-i-Mutasham should also be afforded satis faction, in a manner which is requisite and possible, for the losses sustained. Your Excellency should, of course, know that the displeasure of every member of the family should be taken into consideration and that it is very necessary to protect and to maintain the properties and the interests of any member of the family.

Toumley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 7.) (No. 58.) ovo/t, ^ Tehran, March 17, 1913. WITH reference to my despatch No. 56 of yesterday’s date 5&gt; and to previous correspondence upon the subject of the perpetually strained relations between the Bakhtiari khans and the Sheikh of Mohammerah, which are recurring causes of uneasiness in Arabistan, where there are to-day considerable important British interests engaged, it may be well to lay before you the salient features of the present cause of discord. # It has long been recognised that it would be undesirable for the Bakhtiaris to acquire a further field for interference in the affairs of Arabistan by the acquisition of certain lands known as the Jerahi that belonged in part to the Nizam-es-Sultaneh and in part to the Mushir-ed-Dowleh. Owing to the peculiar manner in which these lands are situated neither of the above-named proprietors was able to exercise much control over them, and they were consequently leased to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, who has, moreover, there is reason to believe, some lien in the shape of a mortgage on the Nizam’s land. With a view to obviating future trouble, an article was inserted into an agreement come to in 1908 between four of the leading Bakhtiari khans and the sheikh of a self- denying character, under which it was stipulated that no one but the sheikh could purchase these lands. Such conventions, unless registered by British consular authorities, not infrequently are but short-lived, and this one proved no exception to the rule, since its clauses have been systematically disregarded by the signatories almost from the date of its conclusion. Possibly basing himself, nevertheless, upon the fact that the Bakhtiaris were precluded under the 1908 agreement from purchasing these lands, the sheikh only offered Mushir-ed-Dowleh 10,000 tomans (2,000L) for them when he proposed to sell in 1910. The Mushir refused the offer, but last year sold the lands to the Bakhtiaris for, it is said, 15,000 tomans (3,000Z.), being glad to be rid of them at any price. It was immediately seen that trouble would probably ensue from this purchase, and, had the legation been made aware of the impending deal before it was completed, I should have endeavoured to prevent its being carried out. When Sardar Jang was appointed last summer to take charge of Bakhtiaristan, I received formal assurances from him that he would adopt no hostile attitude towards the sheikh, and I learned with pleasure from him that he was prepared to negotiate the sale of the Jerahi lands to the sheikh. Trusting to Sardar Jang’s good faith, and believing that he was empowered by the khans more especially concerned to sell the lands, I informed His Majesty’s Besident and consul-general at Bushire of the nature of the assurances given me. When Sardar Jang was about to move down into winter quarters a rumour got about that a large Bakhtiari force was being collected with the avowed intention of taking forcible possession of the Jerahi lands, which are still in the occupation of the sheikh. There is reason to believe that Sardar Jang lent considerable colour to this report by asserting that he had received instructions from the khans at Tehran to take possession of the Jerahi lands. It is, in my opinion, open to doubt whether such a drastic step was ever really intended, but the collection of a large Bakhtiari force gave colour to the rumour, and the sheikh at once assembled an even larger force at Nasiri, and openly announced his intention of resisting any attempt to take possession of the lands. Whatever Sardar Jang’s intentions may have been, I was warned some time before the rumour of his intended action reached me that the sheikh was preparing an army of considerable dimensions. As soon as the strained nature of the situation was brought to my notice I impressed upon the khans in Tehran that no breach of the peace must occur, and I urged them to remove the cause of unrest by authorising Sardar Jang to sell the lands at a reasonable price to the sheikh. All my efforts in this direction have proved unavailing, though I have received categorical assurances that there shall be no breach of the peace, an earnest of which good intention would appear to be provided by the [2874 g —14] 22 fact that a very considerable portion of Sardar Jang’s force has been sent off against the Kuhgluis. Sir P. Cox has urged me to order the khans to sell the lands at an arbitrary price based upon the amount of money they paid for them and what the sheikh offered for them. Opinions differ largely as to the real value of the lands, and the lowest price the khans are prepared to take is 80,000 tomans (16,000L), whilst the most the sheikh will give appears to be 25,000 tomans (5,000L). Sir P. Cox bases his argument that I can adopt a high-handed attitude upon the fact of the assurances I received. As regards these, I unfortunately believed that Jang had power to sell when he had not, and I am of opinion that the attitude of the sheikh in this matter has been fully as provocative as that of the Bakhtiaris. Moreover, if I order the khans to sell at what may appear to Sir P. Cox a fair price, I risk both a refusal on their part to do so and incurring their enmity at a moment when it is still desirable to humour them. I propose to continue to press upon them that they should sell the lands in order to obviate all future possible quarrels. They say that they are willing to do this if the legation insists, but they make a condition that the negotiations for the sale shall be carried on at Tehran. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government,] r i * t %J ' PERSIA. [April 7.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section H. [15866] No. 1. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 7.) (No. 56.) Sir, Tehran, March 16, 1913. I AM in receipt of your despatch No. 9 of the 20th January last, in which you were so good as to forward me a copy of a letter from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company submitting a copy of a memorandum from their political agent upon the subject of Bakhtiaristan. In answer to your request for any observations that^ f may have to make upon the accusations brought against the Bakhtiaris in Dr. Young s memorandum, I have the honour to state that I have made enquiry from His Majesty s consul-general at Ispahan as to what foundation there is for the charge made against Sardar ZafTar that, whilst Governor of Ispahan, he ordered the bakers to pay him a tax of 1 toman per diem each. Mr. Grahame informs me, in reply, that he has never heard this accusation made against Sardar Zaffar, although it is well known that that rapacious khan was in no way particular as to the methods he adopted for filling his capacious pockets. I am afraid that the Bakhtiaris have themselves alone to thank for the reputation thev have earned for plundering and spoiling whenever the occasion has offered, but there would appear reason to hope that, with the acquisition of wealth, the leading khans have at least become more reasonable, as I continue to receive good accounts of the conduct of the two at Ispahan and Eerman. In writing of the relations between the Bakhtiaris and the Sheikh of Mohammerah, Dr. Young makes a mistake in saying that the Jerahi lands, the possession of which by the Bakhtiaris is a cause of irritation to the sheikh, were purchased from the Nizam-es-Sultaneh. The portion of these lands belonging to the Nizam is still in the occupation of Sheikh Khazal, and the quarrel is about the other half of the lands which the khans bought from Mushir-ed-Dowleh last summer. Although I am persuaded that there has been a good deal of bluff on both sides in the “ come on ” attitude adopted by the chiefs at Makimir and Nasiri respectively, the presence of considerable armed forces arrayed against each other in a menacing manner has been the cause of considerable uneasiness in Arabistan, and, as you are aware, Sir, I have not desisted during the past three months from impressing upon the khans here that there must be no breach of the peace. I am continuing my endeavours to persuade the khans to sell the lands in question to the sheikh, but they are fully aware what a thorn in the side their possession of them is to their antagonist, and I have so far been unable to make them propose a sufficiently reasonable figure to offer any prospect of a deal being possible. I propose to treat the question at greater length in an accompanying despatch. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. [2874 g—ll]Gnclnsvr ■ -tr fr;m -'''ry. India.

In continuation of my letter No. 36-124, dated the 26th February 1913, I have the honour to submit herewith translations of two telegrams received by Sardar-i-Jang from Amir Mujahid reporting an alleged victory over the Kuhgilu at Khairabad by the Behbehan column. I may add that Amir Mujahid is considered a braggart and a liar even by the Bakhtiari Khans who are not themselves distinguished for modesty or truthfulness. I learn from local enquiry that the burjs referred to are four guard towers ■ used by the Kuhgilu for watching their crops. They have accommodation for a garrison of only five or six men each. Translation of a telegram from Amir Mujahid, Behbehan, to Sardar*i-Jang and Murteza Quli Khan ) Ram Hormuz, dated 8 th Burj-i-Hut 133/ (z=:26th February igi 3 &gt;) After compliments.—On the \ 6 t\\ Rabi-ul-Awal the force under Sikandar Khan and Karim Khan and under the supreme command of Haji Abid started (from Behbehan) and on the 17th reached Khairabad. Notwithstanding the demands (of the commanders) that the enemy should vacate their burjs, they paid no attention and prepared for resistance. On the morning of the 18th, the mountain guns opened fire on the burjs of the Arui and the Bakhtiari warriors attacked. After a fight of four hours the burjs were captured. Many of the enemy were killed and captured. Such bravery and manliness was shewn by the Bakhtiaris that the livers of the Kuhgilus, both friends and enemies, melted, and it was a cause of wonder to the whole world. During the fight Assad Khan, Bavi, joined the Bakhtiari army. He shewed great bravery. After the fight was finished Shukrullah Khan and the Tamarudi tribe arrived. 2,000 horse and foot of the Darashuri and Kashquli also came to offer their services to the army and undertook to exterminate the Kuhgilu. In short, since the Bakhtiari’s first battle was with the Boir Ahmadi Garmsiri (and was a victory) the extermination of the Kuhgilus is certain and they have no chance of standing against us. 28 APB 1 C96FDr 2 The Aqaqieh Giveh who are the most warlike of the Kuhgilus are making preparations for flight to Mamasaniand the frontier. I have ordered that their retreat should be cut off. I have made such arrangements with the Kashgai and the Kashquli, who f are my friends, that they will not leave the breath in the body of a single one of the enemy. Haji Abid begs to say that you (Sardar-i-Jang) thought his promises of support false and unreliable but when in two weeks he has tied all the Kuhgilus on the backs of dogs, destroyed them) and completely rooted them out then you will know that he is the same old Haji Abid of Tabriz and Yezd who is your servant and that he has not lied. If he has not done this no longer con sider him a man. If there had not been a victory I would have been upset. In five days I have borrowed tumans 7,000 and started off the army. In the battle there were 3,0 o Bakhtiaris, Agha Jaris and Behbehanis, 2,000 Darashuri and Kashqulis and 1,000 followers of Shukrullah Khan and Assad Khan (Bavi). Such an army has never been seen by anybody (before) nor has talk of such a force reached the ears of anyone. 1 am grateful for the trouble and interest taken by you. Your slave YUSUF.

What you said, to the effect that it would have been better had I accompanied the army myself, is correct but until I was satisfied and had made satisfactory arrangements I did not despatch the force. I thought of leaving with the force, even though I was ill, but the Bakhtiari Khans and Haji Abid pursuaded me not to leave so that I could support them from here. It was important that I should remain, in the interests of the army, to look after my prisoners Ali Muhammad Khan and others, to forward supplies to the army and to direct the operations of the forces under Sarum*ul-Mulk and Hussain Khan. For these reasons I considered it advisable to remain here. Through your good fortune in such a manner have the Kuhgilus been exterminated in the first battle that they have no hope of replying or further resisting. Make your minds easy as regards myself and the army. I have made such arrangements and plans as are unimaginable.Enclosure ' ' 'cr frtn F nr r^^ry, India A'o. 15 11, dated 10 APR l&amp;W CONFIDENTIAL. T ^ vjitjr lw !

It appears that this defile is on the direct road from Qaleh Damn to the present whereabouts of the column (near Qaleh Raisi) and the enemy by holding it prevent supplies etcetera from reaching the force. The column is reported to be hard pressed for supplies and unable to procure anything locally. Some hundreds of the Bakhtiari tufangchis are reported to have deserted from the column and fled to their homes being robbed and stripped on the way by the Kuhgilus. Sardar-i-Jang is now trying to arrange to forward supplies to the column by another circuitous route and Mahmud Khan of Dalun has been summoned to Ram Hormuz in connection with these proposed arrangements. No further news has been received regarding the Behbehan column.

We have been repeatedly assured by the Sardar-i-Jang that a transference of the lands would be effected, and these assurances, which Your Excellency under took to make good, the Shaikh was called upon to accept. It is not for me to pronounce on considerations involving the precise nature of the British interests at stake in the north and the extent to which they demand that we should permit our concrete interests and position in the south to be prejudiced in order to meet the threatening developments ahead. I can only reit erate that our position in Arabistan, where our principal solid interests are now centred, will be affected adversely should Your Excellency be unable, by induc ing the Khans to sell, to make good the assurances which were communicated in conformity with your above quoted telegrams to the Shaikh. I should add that as far as I am aware there is no reason to suppose that within any reasonable period there will be any substantial increase in the value of the Jarrahi lands.

They were extremely well received by the Khans who sent out a large ‘ istaqbal ’ party headed by two of the younger Khans to meet them and made exceptionally elaborate arrangements for their accommodation. It is interesting to remark that the peasants of the Bakhtiari-owned villages on the Ramuz plain through which they passed greeted them with unrestrained joy, praying aloud that their mission of peace should be crowned with success. The peasants well realize the danger of Arab retaliation to which they would be exposed, should hostilities break out between the Arabs and Bakhtiaris, during the summer when the latter have withdrawn to their summer quarters. Haji Rais spent several days after his arrival in talking over matters with the Khans and going into the questions at issue between them. Haji Rais attempted to persuade the Sardar and Murteza Quli Khan to at once sell them their own two shares in the Jerrahi which amounts to half of the total share possessed by the Khans. In this he was however unsuccessful. Regarding the Aqili indemnity Sardar-i-Jang agreed, after much persuasion, 'J to consider the incident closed, in view of the fact that the Shaikh’s son was now his guest, and said that he would make no further claims for compensation to the Shaikh. He gave a sealed agreement to this effect to Haji Rais. J may remark that probably this unwonted generosity is displayed in anticipation of similar generosity on the part of the Shaikh when the price to be paid for Jerrahi comes under discussion. After four days spent in these discussions, in which I purposely took no part, I thought the time ripe for reminding the Chiefs of their promise to themselves telegraph to the Khans in Tehran asking for permission to sell the Jerrahi to the Shaikh. Accordingly, this morning, I visited the Chiefs and persuaded them to give me the telegram of which I attach a translation. The original has been handed to me for despatch vid Bushire. It will be noted that the concluding paragraph is false but the Chiefs were desirous of inserting it with a view to expediting the reply from the Khans in Tehran. Haji Rais was successful in obtaining a written undertaking from the Khans that under no circumstance would they make a move on Jerrahi. He also2 obtained the friendly countenance of the Sardar to the betrothal of a daughter of Amir Mujahid to Shaikh Chasib. I have the honour to request that if possible arrangements may be made for the Tehran Khan’s reply to the Sardar’s telegram to be sent to me for delivery to the Sardar. Should this not be possible I would request that 1 be provided with a copy of the reply. A copy of this letter has been forwarded to His Majesty’s Consul, Mohammerah. Translation of a telegram from Sardar-i-Jang and Murteza Quit Khan, Ram Hormuz, to Samsam-us-Sultaneh, Sardar Assad and Sardar Muhtesham, Tehran, dated 28th Rabi-uUAwaal 1331 (7th March 1913). After compliments. —His Excellency Sardar Arfa’ has sent his son, His Excellency Nusret-ul-Mulk and Haji Rais-ut-Tujjar to us. They have been here for some days. Since Nusret-ul-Mulk has come to your house and all the Chiefs of the Bakhtiaris and Arabs and Kuhgilus know that that exalted personage has sent his son to your house it is fit and becoming that you should by telegraph present the Jerrahi lands to Nusret-ul-Mulk who is your own son. We also especially request that in view of the greatness of yourselves and Sardar Arfa’ you should present this land by telegraph. We ourselves thought of giving him a paper of delivery (of the land) but since we had no authority (to do so) we considered (such action) would be disrespectful to you. The grant of this favour will make us esteemed among the tribesmen and will exalt our position. We hope that you will soon send a favourable reply. We have sent this telegram by a special messenger to Bushire and we beg you to reply quickly that this messenger may not be delayed in Bushire. Seals of Sardar-i-Jang and Murteza Quli Khan. Telegram P., No. no, dated 17th March 1913. From—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Your telegram No. 129-461. One only of the telegrams quoted therein refers to the sale of the Jerrahi lands. When Sardar-i-Jang assured me spon taneously that he had the power to carry out the sale and that he would do so, I believed him, which was unfortunate as not only do the Khans here deny that he has the power, but say that they have no confidence in him to make a fair bargain, as he has no personal interest in the lands. The more persistently I press the Khans to sell the more clearly do they come out into the open, making it plain that except at a prohibitive price they are not willing to sell. It is repeated by them that they are prepared to lease the lands to the Shaikh, and they say that if the Shaikh refused to buy the lands and consequently let them fall into their hands at an absurdly low price it is no fault of theirs. # They maintain that the lands are as necessary to them as a protection upon the Shaikh’s encroachments on their Arabistan properties, as they are to the Shaikh. It is proposed by them that if they are to be forced to sell, conditions should be negotiated here, the Muin-ut-Tujjar, or anyone else the Shaikh likes to name being nominated to act for him, and the Sardar Bahadur representing them. They refuse all idea of negotiations on the spot because they say that the Sardar i*Jang would come under the influence of His Majesty’s Consular Officers, in whose impartiality they regret they are unable to place implicit confidence.They decline to listen to any price lower than 80,000 tomans, but ask that the Shaikh should state (?) his price, adding that if the Shaikh will neither Jease the lands no^pay a fair price for them, they will not, out of respect for the wishes of His Majesty’s Legation, go to war about it but will let their sons fight it out with the Shaikh’s sons. They claim that the lands have now cost them, with interest on the purchase money which was borrowed, and including losses incurred from not taking possession, some 23,000 tomans. ^ Of course they talked a lot of bombast, but it is clear that except at a high price they are deter mined not to sell. As to the assurances given in my telegrams quoted above that no hostile movement would be made against the Shaikh by the Khans, I am doubtful whether one party has been much more to blame than the other, as ^ I have received repeated assurances from the Khans here that no hostile action was intended, whilst long ago 1 was warned by the Persian Government that an expedition (a foreknowledge of which was apparently possessed by certain of his Arab friends in the Gulf) was being prepared by the Shaikh. CiFD—44—7-4-I3—GCBP Simlat 2 men and dependents of the late Ilkhani’s sons have made up their minds that war should at first be made in the interior of Bakhtiari and then with the Arabs. I have encountered difficulties in consequence of this. I beg to represent defin itely to you and to their Highnesses and to swear by the soul of the late Ilkhani that if the occupation of Jarrahi is commenced, there will ensue such a fighting in the interior of Bakhtiari that it would be impossible to repair the damage. It is also certain as to what result will be produced by fighting with Arabistan. What misfortune has befallen the Bakhtiaris that they must abandon all their properties in Arabistan for a piece of barren and arid land like that of the Jarrahi, close their road, bring their trade to a standstill, cause disturbance and blood shed in the interior of Bakhtiari and wage war with Arabistan for years ? Much as I think, I cannot understand the reason for this. If an immediate telegram does not reach the Sardar-i-Jang to desist, or to effect a conciliation, you should abandon Bakhtiari, the Arabistan territories, etc. I have no object and motive but to state my good wishes and you are now at liberty either to mend or disturb the matter. Telegram (undated). From— Yusuf (Amir-i-Mujahid, Governor of Behbehan), To—Their Highnesses, The Samsam-es-Sultaneh, The Sardar-i-Asad, and The Sardar-i-Muhtasham, C/o The Sardar-i-Bahadur, Tehran. In compliance with your august orders, I have formed two large armies for suppressing and punishing the Bowair Ahmadis, Taibis and other malefactors of ( of Kuhgiluieh. I had not begun action when news was received from the Sardar-i-Jang and Murteza Quli Khan that Your Highness have given orders that Jarrahi should be occupied by force. It would have been well that you should firstly remove the malefactors and then commence war in Arabistan. Firstly, the Sardar-i*Arfa’a possesses a Qoran and a document from all Your Highnesses and the Family, that Jarrahi is the property and pasture of all Arabs and that the Bakhtiaris have no right or permission to purchase and retain the same. Apart from this, the occupation of Jarrahi is impossible. I do not think that even if a loss of 200,000 tomans and a thousand lives is sustained, the occupation and retention of it will be practicable. Further, as soon as occupa tion is begun, war will take place between the Bakhtiaris and the Arabs at every point. Another disadvantage is this that all the men and dependents of the sons of the Ilkhani have prepared themselves, so that, if it is proposed to begin war with Arabistan for the occupation of Jarrahi, they should at first bring about fighting in the interior of Bakhtiari and then with Arabistan. They have all pre pared themselves for a civil war. Why was such an order given to the Sardar-i- Jang by Your Highnesses, who have perfect information as regards the condi tion of Bakhtiari ? 1 swear by your dear souls that if the least measure is taken in occupying jarrahi, the interior of Bakhtiari will be so disturbed as to become irreparable. You should send numerous telegrams to the Sardar-i-Jang, as soon as possible, to compromise the Jarrahi affair either by exchange of land or by payment. Should your telegram not be received and should the least action be taken in this matter, you should abandon Bakhtiari and the Arabistan properties. The road for foreign and internal trade will also be closed and apart from the war with Arabistan, such a fighting will take place in the interior of Bakhtiari that no one will see any prosperity in Bakhtiari and Arab istan. At the same time, this humble one has encountered difficulties. I do not know what misfortune has befallen the Bakhtiaris that they should carry on fighting and bloodshed for years in the interior of their country and in Arabistan, for the sake of the barren and arid land of Jarrahi. I swear by the soul of the late Ilkhani that I am not making a misrepresentation. Now, if you desire tofight and to devastate Bakhtiari and Arabistan, you are at liberty to do so but if you have no such a desire, you should send frequent telegrams to the Sardar-i- Jangat once before the affair has become serious, so that he may endeavour for a conciliation. Code Telegram No. 901, dated the 22nd Safar 1331 (=3oth January 1913). From— Sultan Abdul Majid, (Ayr-ed-Dowleh), To—His Excellency the Sardar-i Arfa’a. In view of our previous friendship I expect that you will not keep me ignor ant of your own well being and the condition of the affairs in those parts. I believe that in view of the good opinion entertained by me of your Islamic feel ings and good wishes for the Government, you will not neglect to fulfil the duties of your service and to display zeal in safeguarding peace and tranquillity in those frontiers, and that you will use more attention in these times in consideration of the intimate relation which you have with me personally, so that no unexpected incident may take place in those parts and the minds of the members of the Gov ernment may rest assured of the tranquillity of those territories by your good offices and endeavours, and I may thus feel honoured. At the same time, I would enquire that according to what is being heard, you have lately been occupied with collecting forces and moving an expedition in those parts. \ d\d not know the details of this and whether this has really happened or if it was only an unfounded rumour. If you have had such a thought, what was the object to be gained thereby ? Was it for safeguarding the tanquiility of your own jurisdiction, or have you had another object in view ? Though I believe that in view of the peaceful motives which have always been a feature of your good will and straightforward disposition, no mishap will arise in the terri tories under you against the interests of the Government and of the country, especially at this time that I am in office and responsible for protecting the peace of the country ; but I would ask that if it is true, you should acquaint me with your objects ^ and the condition of affairs in those parts ; and you should use much precaution that the exigencies of the time should be fully observed and nothing undesirable should be heard of in those parts and that the affairs of those regions should be tranquil according to my desires and pleasant reports should be received. Telegram (undated). From— Khazal, To—His Highness the Minister for Interior, Tehran. In reply to No. 901, I venture to state that your august telegram of the 6th Rabi-el-Awal (= 13th February 1913), has been received. As to your enquiry about the despatch of an expedition (consisting) of Arab forces, whereas certain instigations, proceedings and correspondence against me have come to light on the part of the Sardar-i-Jang Ilkhani of the Bakhtiaris, who has arrived in Arabistan since the last two months, especially on the pretext that the Bakhtiari Khans have purchased one half of Jarrahi from His Excellency the Mushir-ed- Dowleh and that he intends taking possession, the Arabs have been stirred to excitement and a large force has collected together in their territories for acting on the defensive ; otherwise they have no intention of any conquest or taking possession of any one’s properties. I have not neglected as yet to safeguard the tranquillity of Arabistan and the frontier, but if anyone wishes to exercise high handedness over them (the Arabs), or to interfere with their territories, it is obvious that they will not allow him so long as a single one of them is alive. In the year 1326 ( = 1908), they (the Bakhtiaris) concluded an undertak ing in the handwriting of the Sardar-i-Jang and in the margin of God’s Word (Qoran) with the presence of the Bakhtiari Khans, all of whom have signed and sealed the same ; and they have mentioned therein the properties under me,* p* p'il CONFIDENT!^ 'N teiua ff 1^ Enclosure * ’ ^er fr • n F- ' India. i\'D. 14 'I, 3 APR ibiO No. 795, dated Bushire, the gth (received 17th) March 1913.

F rom _YusUF (Amir-i-Mujahid, Governor of Behbehan), To—His Excellency the Sardar-i-Bahadur, Tehran. No reply has been received to all the telegrams wired by me to you and to their Highnesses. You are much neglecting the affairs of Bakhtiari and Arabis tan. Perhaps you are not aware that it had been arranged, in regard to the question of Jarrahi, that the affair should be compromised either by exchange of properties or by payment. His Excellency the Sardar-i-]ang and Murteza Quli Khan state that orders have been received from their Highnesses from Tehran that forcible possession should be taken. Had I known that the occupation of Jarrahi would be easy and convenient, I would not venture (to make any repre sentations) ; but the occupation of Jarrahi is impossible. Even after one thousand Arabs and Bakhtiaris are killed the occupation and retention of Jarrahi will not be possible. If the occupation is begun, fighting will ensue. Moreover, all the TQAPRtS'i i C 94 FD4 especially Jarrahi, etc., (stating) that as they are the sites of the cultivation of the Arabs, the Bakhtiaris have no right to purchase (them) ; and m case any of the Bakhtiaris should, at any time, make a purchase, they have undertaken to seize the property from him and to surrender it to me at the same price. The Mushir-ed-Dowleh is acquainted with International Laws and knows that the Arabs have the right of first refusal. The Saham-ed-Dowleh had written to Haii Rais four years ago, (asking) whether or not the Shaikh wished to make a purchase if the heirs of the late Mushir-ed-Dowleh Sadr-i- Azam wished to sell Jarrahi. He (Haji Rais) had given a reply and offered a price of ten thousand tomans. The same enclosure (to Haji Rais’ letter) is still with the Mushir-ed-Dowleh and he had sent a copy of it one month ago. No reply was then received from the Saham-ed-Dowleh and the other heirs did not state at any time that they contemplated to make a sale. In case they had such an intention, it was necessary for them to inform me at first. It appears, however, that they have been constrained to sell it to the respected Khans for certain con siderations. In any case, the Arabs, who are in fact the real owners of this property, and who hold estates and cultivations there, possess the right of first refusal. This sale and purchase which have been concluded without their knowledge, are null and void, and it (the property) should be returned to themselves (the Arabs) at the same price for which the transaction has been made. If the members of the exalted Government take no measures to check this highhandedness, it is obvious that the peace of Arabistan will be disturbed, and this humble will not be re sponsible for whatever loss and damage which may be sustained by ^ the foreign subjects and the nationals ; and they will concern the party who wishes to take forcible possession of the homes and properties of the Arabs. I am humbly ready to carry out services and your obligatory commands. Extract from Ahvoaz Vice Consulate Diary No. I H. Q.^ dated 18th February ' 9 ' 3 - Condition of Country. 2. Agha Mohamed Zaman is offering Shaikh Murteza cash in return for the property alleged to be looted in Shushter from the latter s house last spring on the condition that he should take an oath, that his property was actually looted. Shaikh Murteza refuses to take an oath and demands the actual property looted. The Governor-General does not seem to interfere in this affair outwardly but was secretly trying to put Agha Mohamed Zaman in prison. The latter has become aware of this and has since discontinued going to the Government fort. 3. Shushter is disturbed. Shaikh Murteza and Mohalla Mugui have formed into one party and Mohallas Mohamed Zaman and Gargari the other. Mirza Mohamed Riza of Mohalla Abdulla Banoo has not yet joined any side. Agha Mohamed Zaman party pretends to take no interest in the disturbance and awaits that the Shaikh Murteza party should begin the fight first. 4. The environs of Shushter are disturbed. Thefts occur day and night. 5. Dizful is disturbed. Mohalla Masjid and Mohalla Qaleh are fighting against each other. 20 men have been wounded and killed on both sides during the week. A caravan consisting of 50 loaded mules belonging to Mohalla Qaleh was stopped by Mohalla Masjid while en route to Dizful from Shushter and mules and loads taken away. 6. The Shushter and Dizful troubles seem to be the result of the Sardar Arfa’s endeavours (as already reported) to draw the Bakhtiari attention in that direction.ting iring jaleh allies ardat that No. 32^117, dated Camp Ram Hormuz, the 2ist February 1S13. From—CAPTAIN A. \ H. Grey, I.A., His Majesty’s Vice-Consul and Assistant Resident, Ahwaz, To— Lieutenant-Colon b l Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. 1 have the honour to inform you that I arrived here today, my journey having been considerably delayed owing to the constant rain and consequent impossibility of the country. I learn that Sardar-i-Jang arrived at Qaleh Dalun from Malamir with the intention of accompanying the Bakhtiari forces to Qaleh Ala but he later changed his mind, remained at Dalun with Murteza Qulli Khan and sent two of the younger Khans with the troops to Qaleh Ala. The Sardar himself proposes to come to Ram Hormuz as soon as he hears satisfactory news as to the progress of the Kuhgilu expedition and as soon as he can obtain sufficient mules for the transport of his own baggage and that of his personal following. The mules that he had with him are being used for collect ing supplies at Qaleh Ala for the use of the forces. He sent to Ram Hormuz for 150 mules but none were forthcoming and he will now probably try to obtain them from Malamir. I will leave for Qaleh Dalun tomorrow and, as I anticipate that the Sardar is not likely to leave there for at least another week, I shall be in ample time to discuss the Shaikh-Bakhtiari question with him before he reaches Ram Hormuz. Ittisam-ul-Mamalik, the assistant to Ijlabus-Sultaneh, is now here having lately returned from seeing Sardar-i-Jang in connection with the Jarrahi and Aqili questions. The Sardar-i-Jang informed him that he had no authority from Samsam-us-Sultaneh and Sardar Muhtesham to make any arrangements with the Shaikh regarding the sale or lease of the Jarrahi lands but that he was telegraph ing to them to ascertain their wishes. Ittisam-ul-Mamalik has written to Haji Rais advising him to come to Ramuz with Shaikh Chasib and discuss matters with Sardar-i-Jang direct. I do not think that Ittisam-ul-Mamalik or his interference in the questions now pending, need be taken into account. He is not an individual of sufficient importance for his partisanship to have the least influence with either the Sardar or the Shaikh. His recommendation regarding the visit of Shaikh Chasib and Haji Rais to Ram Hormuz is certainly not likely to find favour in the eyes of h latter at the present juncture. For the present and probably for some time to come all the available Bakh tiari forces are fully employed with the Kuhgilu tribes and there is no probability of the Sardar attempting to send ‘ mamurs ’ to the Jarrahi lands. The news I hear regarding the steps being taken against the Kuhgilus is verv satisfactory and gives every promise of success. I will however submit a detailed report when I reach Dalun and have obtained more reliable information. No. 33-120, dated Camp Kimeh (Ramuz), the 25th February 1913. From—C aptain A. J. H. Grey, I.A., His Majesty’s Vice-Consul and Assistant Resident, Ahwaz, To-Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to report that I reached Sarileh on the 23rd instant and there interviewed Sardar-i-Jang and Murtaza Quh Khan. I explained to them that the critical situation which was rap'dty arising ms 'avis the Shaikh of Mohammerah was causing us grave anxiety this reason I had been specially deputed with conc “ rr f ence Minister to open the way to direct friendly negotiations between themselves and the Shaikh. 1 went on to say that at present the only stumbling block to the establishment of friendly relations between them was the question of Jarrahi lan C94FDthat at the time the Khans had purchased the Mushir-ud-Dowleh’s share in these lands Sardar-i-Jang had assured His Majesty s Minister that he proposed to re-sell them to the Shaikh, that he had undertaken to see that the Khans demands were neither excessive nor unreasonable and that the Khans now in Tehran had since constantly told His Majesty’s Minister that they had no hostile intentions towards the Shaikh and were prepared to accept any arrangement made with him on their behalf by Sardar-i-Jang. I pointed out that though they had now been some months in the low T country they had not only failed to approach the Shaikh with any proposals for the sale of the land but had stated in open medjliss that they had no intention of selling it and were about to send their representatives to take over the property. I then asked them to tell me what their real intentions were so that I could inform His Majes* ty’s Minister. Sardar-i-Jang replied that he had guessed in advance the reason of my visit to him. He acknowledged that he had had the intention of re-selling the Jarrahi to the Shaikh and all the Khans had agreed to this course at the time that he left Tehran. When at Chighakhur and Dehkurd, however, there had been telegraphic correspondence between him and the other Khans in Tehran on the subject of the Jarrahi which had finally left him in some doubt as to what were the real wishes of the Khans in this direction. To clear matters up he had, just prior to his departure for the ‘ kishlaq,’wired to Tehran asking for definite instructions as to whether he should or should not sell the Jarrahi to the Shaikh and in the former case what price he should demand. He received a reply in which he was clearly told not to effect a sale under any circumstances but to send mamurs to the property when he reached Ramuz. This was the last he had heard from the Khans on the subject and he was bound to act in accordance with their wishes in a matter which concerned their private property. I replied that what he told me caused me the greatest surprise. The Khans in Tehran had on more than one occasion assured His Majesty’s Minister that they would accept any arrangement come to by him on this very matter, that their intentions towards the Shaikh were most pacific and that in no case would a resort be had to force. I said that they well knew that the control of the Jarrahi was vital to the Shaikh, their 1908 agreement with him admitted as much, and that, under the circumstances, an advance of Jarrahi would, as he knew, in all probability lead to a breach of the peace. The Sardar, on being thus driven into a corner, lost his temper completely and all control of himself. In a loud and heated tone he demanded to know by what right we interfered in this matter and supported a cowardly and unmanly puppet against them. “ The Shaikh will demand our wives ” he said “ and you and your Minister and jour Government will say that we must give them. If he wanted the Jarrahi why did he not buy it when he had the opportunity. Let him fight for it now if he wants it. Whose fault is it but his that our agreement (of 1908) is waste paper ? Does he think that it allowed him to plunder our property at Aqili and imprison our proteges in Shushter ? etc., etc.” During this heated tirade I maintained complete silence but let the Sardar see from my manner that his words and manner had given me offence. When he had ceased and there had been silence for some time, during which he had cooled down, he turned to my mirza and asked whether what he had said was not correct. I told the mirza that it was unnecessary for him to say anything as I had heard what the Sardar had to say and further discussion was useless. A further long silence ensued and the Sardar then somewhat sheepishly hazarded some remarks upon other subjects to which I replied in monosyllables. They shortly afterwards left. That evening I refused the Cniefs’ customary mehmani making the excuse that 1 had already made my arrangements for supplies. The following day we marched to Mamatain, I reaching camp some hours before the Chiefs. t ' a fter their arrival I received a letter from them, couched in unusually friendly terms, saying that they wished to call on me at any time I fixed.. At the interview the Sardar-i-Jang said that he feared that what he had said the previous evening had caused me displeasure. He asked my pardon if this was so. He hoped that he had not given me the impression that he was not now, as always, willing to carry out the wishes of the British Government whatever they might be. The Bakhtiari Chiefs and the tribesmen realized that they were our servants [mutih) and we their friends. Regarding the object of my journey, he said that he and Murteza Quli Khan had had a long talk and had well considered the matter and they had now come to tell me their decision. They had intended on their arrival at Ramuz to send two mamurs with a handful of followers to Jarrahi. Had they been stopped by the Arabs they would have sent a force sufficient to overcome all resistance and forcibly taken possession of the property. They had now completely abandoned the intention of sending any mamurs or forces over the Arabistan frontier in any direction whatever. “ Of this,” he said “ I solemnly assure you before my Ilbegi and you may make your mind at ease regarding any chance of a breach of the peace.” Regarding the sale of the Jarrahi to the Shaikh he said that, as we wished it, they would not only not resist us in this matter but would support us against the heads of the two families—Samsam-us-Sultaneh and Sardar-i-Muhtesham. He begged me to believe that what he had told me the previous evening, i.e., that he had clear instructions from the Khans at Tehran not to sell, was the truth. The instant that the Khans empowered him to sell he would do so and at a price which would be acceptable to us and the Shaikh. He said that if we could get the Shaikh to send his son and Haji Rais to see him at Ramuz it would strengthen his position vis a vis the Khans in Tehran and he undertook on their arrival to himself wire to the Khans saying that the Shaikh’s son was a guest in his house and that it was incumbent on them to accede to his request and dispose of the Jarrahi to him. He would add that if they did not authorize him to effect the sale he would resign. He asked rae to urge His Majesty’s Minister immediately to press Samsam- us-Sultaneh and Sardar Muhtesham to authorize him by telegraph to effect the sale and specially requested that the telegram giving him this authority should be sent through His Majesty’s Minister. He explained that the Khans were quite capable of assuring us that they were sending or had sent the authority to sell and telegraphing to him in a contrary sense. He assured me that if His Majesty’s Minister adopted a firm attitude and refused to listen to proposals of lease and other compromises the Khans would yield and grant him the neces sary authority. Regarding the Minister’s telegram to him the Sardar said that he did not know how to reply to it before but would now answer explaining that he lacked authority to sell or otherwise dispose of the lands to the Shaikh but that he would immediately act on such authority when given. He said he would send a draft of his answer to me for any additions or omissions that I might suggest. This morning we marched to Kimeh, a village of Ramuz, where we are now encamped. This afternoon the Sardar sent his munshi to me with the promised draft of his reply to His Majesty’s Minister regarding which I said I had no sugges tions to make. He again urged on me the importance of obtaining the power of attorney for the sale of the Jarrahi through His Majesty's Minister, and repeated his assurances that when he had this in his hands he would settle the question in a manner satisfactory to the Shaikh. Such is the result of the various interviews which I have had with the Sardar-i-Jang. Although fully alive to the unfortunate fact that little reliance can be placed in the word of any of the Bakhtiari Chiefs, I am quite convinced in my own mind that there is now no longer any danger of the Sardar attempting to take over Jarrahi by force or otherwise. I am further convinced that the Sardar is now sincerely desirous of settling the Jarrahi difficulty by either sale or exchange onV. 8 reasonable terras and will do so if the senior Khans of both families will allow him I fully believe his statement that he is not at present empowered to do so. J M mu The truth of this assertion is indirectly Tide Minister’s telegram No. 64, dated 12th nicnuiu L £ ^ . ,, rr, February 1913. proved by the fact that the Khans at Tehran are still issuing “instructions” to him regarding the disposal of the property. I have the honour to request that you will, if you deem it advisable, tele graph an extract of this letter to His Majesty’s Minister and especially urge the necessity of obtaining for Sardar-i-Jang a genuine power of attorney authorising him to sell, exchange, lease or otherwise dispose of the Jarrahi on behalt ot the Khans at his absolute discretion. With this authority lam confident of being able to bring about a complete settlement of all outstanding difficulties. The Shaikh of Mohammerah has already asked me whether he should send out his son and Haji Rais to see the Sardar and I am now advising him to do so. A copy of this letter has been forwarded to His Majesty’s Consul, Moham merah. No. 37-125, dated Camp Kimeh (Ramuz), the 27th February 1913. From— -Captain A. J. H. Grey, I.A., His Majesty's Vice-Consul and Assistant Resident, Ahwaz, To— -Libutenant-Colonbl Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In continuation of my letter No. 33-120, dated the 25th February have the honour to inform you that I have had further interviews with Sardar-i- Jang and Murteza Qulli Khan. They have repeated their assurances that they are prepared to arrange the sale of the Jarrahi lands to the Shaikh at a reasonable figure the moment they receive the Khans’ authority to do so. They have also undertaken that, under no circumstances, will they send representatives to the land—even if the vakalat nameh asked for is not given. They propose to leave here for Ab Bid (yia the Oil Fields) as soon as possible after the meeting with Shaikh Chasib and Haji Rais has taken place and they have sent the promised message to the Khans in Tehran urging them to grant authority for the sale of the lands to the Shaikh of Mohammerah. I will return to Ahwaz as soon as the Khans leave here for Ab Bid and will rejoin them at the latter place, when the vakalat nameh is obtained, to arrange the final details of settlement and to keep the Khans to their word that their demands will not be excessive. 1 learn from confidential sources that the Khans here did not realise that the question of their differences with the Shaikh of Mohammerah was of such grave concern to us but that they have now formed the opinion that any opposi tion to our wishes in this matter may have far reaching consequences for them and they are themselves most anxious to settle matters with the Shaikh in an amicable manner. Under these circumstances I hope that their representations to the Khans in Tehran added to the pressure brought to bear by His Majesty’s Minister will have the desired effect of making them yield and authorizing the Khans here to settle with the Shaikh as they consider best. No. 32-C., dated Camp Ahwaz, the 27th February 1913. From— Major L. B. H. Haworth, I.A., His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Arabistan, To— Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.L, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In continuation of my No. 29-C., dated 22nd February 1913, and with refer ence to your telegram No. 288, dated 12th February, I have the honour to informyou that I left Mohammerah on the morning of the 23rd February in the S.S. “ Malamir, ” arriving here on the 25th instant. Captain Grey had, as you are aware, already left Ahwaz in order to see the Sardar-i-Jang. The three representatives of the Sardar-i-Jang Arshad-ud-Dowleh, Daood Khan and Haji Abdul Karim are still here, but are anxious to return to Sardar-i- jang. Daood Khan is a trusted agent of the Haji Ilkhani family representing Amir Mufakham, Sardar-i-Jang etcetera in their transactions. The reappearance of Arshad-ud-Dowleh once more is nothing short of extraordinary but here he is and once more assisting in representing Sardar-i-Jang in the r 61 e of “ my honoured uncle.’* The whole situation is very complicated but bodes as well as anything can, where the Bakhtiaris are concerned. The three envoys above mentioned have been very anxious for the Shaikh to send Shaikh Chasib and Haji Rais to meet the Sardar-i-Jang at Ramuz. Before my arrival, after Captain Grey’s departure, the Shaikh knowing of the latter’s mission, wrote to him asking if his son should go or not. Captain Grey replied that they had better wait until he had seen Sardar-i-Jang. At that time he had not received the Minister’s telegram No. 64 to you regarding the attempt to lease the Jarrahi lands to the Shaikh. Before going further it is necessary to state the position of the Amir Mujahid in the negotiations which have been going forward. I have previously reported that the Amir Mujahid has been steadily sup porting the Shaikh in all matters during the last year ; latterly the bonds between them have been getting closer. The Amir Mujahid has now written to Sardar-i-Jang stating that he would be no party to any attempt to take the Jar rahi lands from the Shaikh, lands to which, he adds, the Bakhtiaris are in no way entitled : he states that he has signed a Koran to the effect that these lands shall he handed over to the Shaikh and that he will not have his word on the Koran broken ; lastly he swears by the soul of the deceased Haji Ilkhani that he will himself fight the Sardar-i-Jang rather than permit such a thing. I am forwarding separately telegrams to the senior Khans in Tehran couched in similar terms. This tenderness of conscience on the part of the Amir Mujahid is somewhat remarkable and one immediately looks for its cause. His threats of fighting his fellow Bakhtiaris are not very likely to be realized but express forcibly that he will have no part in. in fact will oppose in every way possible, any attack on the Shaikh, and as he is now, with his nephew at the head of the Bakhtiari forces, his statements have some value. What however is of more importance is the threat which he has made to the Sardar-i-Jang that he will throw up the Governorship of Behbehan and will refuse to have anything further to do with the punishment of the Kuhgilus if any movement is made against the Shaikh. This might have been taken for a further bit of bluff but for the fact that he is now giving his daughter to the Shaikh’s son in marriage. It is evident that the Amir Mujahid is not following the line he is taking, for nothing, and one immediately asks why is he doing it. To answer this question it is necessary to take into consideration the past history of the Shaikh-Bakhtiari question and the incident of the recalcitrant Khans of last year. Notwithstanding the enmity which has existed between the Shaikh and the Bakhtiaris it has always been the policy of the varied factions of the latter tribe to keep on friendly terms with the Shaikh. A few years ago the Sardar Assad offered his daughter in marriage to one of the Shaikh’s sons, an offer which was, very foolishly, not accepted. More recently the Haji Ilkhani family have been the section who have suc ceeded in gaining the friendship of the Shaikh. The value of this friendship hasoften been very great, both on account of the financial assistance which has been gained and also for other help which the Shaikh has given at critical times. There is little doubt that the friendship of the Shaikh has always been con sidered an asset by the Bakhtiaris who have at all times been at enmity with each other, an enmity which still continues, though temporarily overshadowed by the desire for common gain. It is evident that Amir Mujahid is not content with the position he holds in comparison with his brothers; his conduct of last year when he headed the junior Khans in their rebellion against the authority of the senior Khans, shows this and it would appear that he considers that his ambitions can best be realised by supporting the Shaikh and gaining his alliance. The Shaikh and Haji Rais, the latter of whom knows the Bakhtiaris as well as any man living, maintain that the Sardar-i-Jang did not obtain such a complete victory over the junior Khans last year as has been supposed. They state that before meeting Captain Grey, Sardar-i-Jang descended at the house of Amir Mujahid and had an interview with him and the other Khans, in which the junior Khans gained a great deal and were given great concessions in the way of lands. The visit at which Captain Grey was present was a subsequent one of the Amir Mujahid to the Sardar-i-Jang after many details had been arranged. There is in any case no doubt that the Sardar-i-Jang made the first visit which is in itself an incident the importance of which, in the circumstances, cannot be ignored. Amir Mujahid further wrote to the Shaikh that he had no intention of going to Yezd but would appoint a representative if given that government and that he would either take Behbehan or stay unemployed in the Bakhtiari country in the meantime. Haji Rais informs me that Amir Mujahid and the junior Khans would not have given way at all had it not been for the intervention of His Majesty’s Legation and the consequent despatch of Captain Grey, which made them realize that they would come up against the British Government if they continued any further. As I reported in my letter No 8o-C., dated 14th September 1912 to you and in my telegram No. 33, dated 28th September 1912 to His Majesty’s Minister, the Amir Mujahid has steadily supported the Shaikh while the present marriage alliance is the fructification of an arrangement formulated last year. The above is sufficient to show that the Shaikh has ground for believing that the Amir Mujahid has power to be of assistance to him in the present troubles and further that their community of interests are sufficient to enable him to be able to trust him. The Amir Mujahid has now telegraphed to the Shaikh to send Shaikh Chasib and Haji Rais to Sardar-i-Jang who has agreed to hand over the Jarrahi lands but requires an excuse to the senior Khans. He states that if Shaikh Chasib comes he will telegraph to the Khans that he has no option but to agree when the Shaikh has sent his son to him. In the circumstances the Shaikh has asked me whether there is any objection to their going. I have replied that I can see no objection, that if the statements made materialise all is^ well ; if not, we are no worse off than we were before, while if the matter is settled without our intervention so much the better, as long as he adheres to his intention of registering the documents, without which precaution I have little faith in the permanency of any agreements made. Haji Rais replied that they would not think of making any agreement with the Bakhtiaris which was not registered with us. In making his arrange ments with the Amir Mujahid the Shaikh has temporized as far as possible. He told me last year that he had been approached by a combination of the junior Khans but that he had no wish to have anything to do wdth Bakhtiari politics since he had learnt by bitter experience that any one friendship meant a corre sponding enemy : he said that he would far rather rely on our good offices. He has however kept in with Amir Mujahid in whom he appears to have had some confidence.s ince the Ghazban incident the Shaikh has been distinctly more nervous re- gardmg ^khhan intentions, and has received various warnings from the Amir Mujahid regarding those of the Sardar-i-Jang. Previous to this he had made no preparations against attack but later moved up to Ahwaz and, as reported by me, collected his headmen. He had no intention of taking any further action and hoped that our good offices would prevail. The Amir Mujahid has however been writing to him strongly advising him to collect forces so as not to expose himself to attack as he did last year and it has been on this advice that the Shaikh has recently been acting. The Shaikh would infinitely rather rely on our good offices and take n o other action but he feels that since we could not tell him that the Bakhtiaris will not attack him he must take defensive measures, he has himself not the faintest wish to have a breach of the peace and is keeping his forces well away from the frontier so as to avoid any chance of a collision. Telegram No, 98-378, dated 3rd March 1913. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. My telegram No. 92-345 dated February 28th. Following is purport of letter dated 25th February at Ramuz received from Orey today. ^^.—Interviewed Sardar-i-Jang on subject of Jarrahi lands. Pointed out that question of Jarrahi was only stumbling block to establishment of friendly relations between Shaikh and Bakhtiari, that Sardar had assured Minister that he proposed to sell lands to Shaikh and that he had undertaken to see that Khans’ demands were neither excessive nor unreasonable, that Khans in Tehran had constantly assured Your Excellency that they had no hostile intentions and were prepared to accept any arrangement made by the Sardar with the Shaikh but that nevertheless he had learnt with surprise that they had announced lately that they had no intention of doing so. In reply Sardar Jang acknowledged that it had been his intention to sell Jarrahi | a ^s to Shaikh, and that all the Khans had agreed to this course at the time he left Tehran, but that afterwards further communications had passed and the last instructions that he received from Khans at Tehran before leaving for low country were that he was not to effect a sale under any circumstances but was to send mamurs to the property. In course of this discussion Sardar-i-lang exhibited considerable anger and ill temper at being cornered in matter but cooled down next day, and announced that in deference to wishes of His Majesty s Government, be had abandoned intention to send mamurs to Tarrahi and that as regards sale of Jarrahi to Shaikh he and Murtaza Quli Khan were prepared not only not to oppose our wishes but would even support us in this matter against the Samsam and Muhtesham. Sardar Jang asked Grey to urge Your Excellency immediately to press the Samsam and Muhtesham to telegraph to him to effect sale and further asked P u rtl , C 3 U u ary and 1 re P ea i tedI y that th e telegram giving him this specific authority should be sent through His Majesty’s Minister. Jang assured Grey that if Your Excellency adopted a firm attitude and refused to listen to proposals of lease and other compromises, Khans would yield and grant him necessary authority to convinced that Sardar is now sincerely desirous of settling the Jarrahi difficulty by sale or exchange on reasonable terms and that he will do so if the senior Khans of both families will allow him. Grey is sure that Jang’s statement that he is at present not empowered to effect sale is correct. Grey asks me to urge the necessity of obtaining for Sardar Jang a genuine power of attorney to be despatched by telegraph through His Majesty’s Legation authorising Sardar Jang to sell or exchange or otherwise dispose of Jarrahi on behalf of Khans at his absolute discretion.12 With this authority he is confident of being able to bring about a complete settlement of all outstanding difficulties.

The bedrock of facts now seems to have been reached on either side, and I fully support recommendations made by Captain Grey. In view of the facts exposed at the above interview, it seems both justifiable and essential that Your Excellency should put your foot down with the Bakhtiari Khans in Tehran, and insist on the necessary authorization being despatched and on the Khans refraining thereafter entirely from further interference and tergiversation.

Further communications received from His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Ahwaz, dated from Ram Hormuz, report that Sardar Jang and Murteza Quli Khan had proceeded to that place specifically with the intention of taking possession of the Jarrahi lands, but that now that they have personally abandoned intentions in that direction, they are most anxious to get matter settled and to leave for Ab Bid. Captain Grey again urges the necessity for despatch of an explicit power of attorney authorising Sardar-i-Jang to sell. Both he and the Sardar-i-Jang are convinced that if insisted on it will be forthcoming, and that an amicable settlement will be assured once it is received. C94FD—44—2 5 -3' 13- GCBP SimlaV I o 'ey.

Extract from Ahwaz News No. 5 for the week ending 4th February igrj. lajest/s jaogaol intention etsonally t matter Kuhgilu. 46. Most satisfactory and surprising reports have been received during the week from Behbehan regarding the steps taken by Sardar-i-Jang and Amir Mujahid, to get the Kuhgilu tribes in hand. Amir Mujahid has appointed Hussein Khan, Bahmai, sole head of the whole Bahmai tribe Muhammad Hussein Khan of Qaleh Ulah has removed to Kamuz. Ah Murad Khan, Bahmai, has vacated Saidun fort and it has been handed over to the Bakhtiaris; Qaleh Dushmuk is still in his possession. Shukrullah Khan, Nasrullah Khan and Fathullah Khan, Boir Ahmedi Chiefs have made their submission to Amir Mujahid. .Aulad Karim Khan, Boir Ahmedi, has not yet come in. P j S ^ man Ziari Khans have not made their submission to the Amir bi the Katkhudas of this tribe are reported to have done so. Ali Murad Khan, Tebi Sarhadi, is standing out against the Bakhtiaris bi ms son has been imprisoned by Sardar-i-Jang and his fort (Qaleh Raisi) is beini besieged by Ba.^htiari forces sent by Sardar-i-Jang aided by the followers 0 Hussein Khan, Bahmai. A force of Bakhtiaris under Sarum-ul-Mulk sent to Amir Mujahid and the preparations made by Sardar-i-Jang at Malamir are said to be the cause of the more anenable attitude of the Kuhgilu. Should it be proved that these reports are not grossly exaggerated there may be some slight hope for the Bakhtiari road next summer. Captain Grey is however, inclined to think that, on the ascent of Sardar-i-Jang and the Bakhtiari 11 to the high country in the spring, the Kuhgilu will feel that they have nothing more to fear from the Bakhtiaris and will raid as usual. It is unlikely that Amir Mujahid (even if he remains in Behbehan during the summer) will be sufficiently strong to keep the tribe quiet. No. 36-124) dated Camp Kimeh (Ramuz), the 26th February 1913. From— Captain A. J. H. Grey, I. A., His Majesty’s Vice-Consul and Assistant Resident. Ahwaz, To— Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I I have the honour to report the steps so far taken bv Sardar-i-Jang for the punishment of the Kuhgilu tribes with the object of ensuring the security of the Bakhtiari road.2 As already reported Ali Mohammed Khan, Tebi Garmsin, is a prisoner with Amir Mujahid at Behbehan. The whole of the Tebi tribe are however in arms against the Bakhtiaris. As regards the Bahmai Hussein Khan has been placed in charge of the whole tribe and is with the Bakhtiaris. His own forts, Likak, Mumbi and Baba Khan, are garrisoned by his own followers. Of the Bahmai Muhammadi forts Qaleh Ala and Qaleh Dishmuk have been vacated by the Bahmai and are now garrisoned by Bakhtiari tufargchis. Qaleh Saidun is held by Ali Murad Khan, Bahmai Muhammadi, on behalf of the Bakhtiaris. Mohammed Hussein Khan, Bahmai Muhammadi with his following is, in accordance with the wishes of Hussein Khan, now at Mamatain. He was ordered to remain there by the Sardar at the request of Hussein Khan as the latter was not quite sure of his protestations of loyalty and support. Hussein Khan himself with a following of some 1,000 Bahmai has gone with the Bakhtiari forces. Shukrullah Khan, Boir Ahmadi, with his followers is supporting Amir Mujahid who is also receiving the support of the Churam and Babi tribes. The tufangchis placed at the Amir’s disposal by these tribes are estimated to number 1,000 men. The Bakhtiaris have been divided into two columns. One, numbering some 1,000 tribesmen under two young Khans, has been sent to Behbehan to the Amir. This column with the i,ooo Kuhgilu supporters advanced on Diz Kuh (Deh Dasht) from the direction of Behbehan on the 21st instant. Abbas Kulli Khan, Ahmed Khusroi, is in command. The other column, numbering some 3,000 Bakhtiari under Sarum-ul-Mulk and two other young Khans, was launched into the Kuhgilu country from the direction of Qaleh Ala on the 20th instant. The 1,000 Bahmai under Hussein Khan have accompained this column. The Kuhgilu tribes who are against the Bakhtiaris consist of the Boir Ahmadis (except Shukrullah Khan and his followers), the Dushman Ziari and the Tebi, both Sarhadi and Garmsiri. These tribes are said to have united against their common enemy the Bakhtiaris and taken up a position in a long defile known as the Teng-i-Takau and round Deh Dasht. Sarum-ul-Mulk’s column has to pass this defile and it is there that they will first come into contact with the enemy. Regarding the chances of success of these punitive measures Sardar-i-Jang and Murteza Quli Khan are themselves far from confident. They consider it possible that the enemy may scatter on the advance of the Bakhtiari and allied Kuhgilu forces and admit that in this event it will be impossible to inflict any damage to them. I would go further and say, judging from what I hear, that it is quite probable that the Kuhgilu may inflict a crushing defeat on the Bakhtiari columns. No intelligence has yet been received as to how these columns have fared but the next few days should bring news of their progress. Should the present measures prove unsuccessful, the Sardar assures me that he will keep the road open during the coming summer by posting a sufficient number of guards upon the road itself. I am, however, doubtful whether the safety of the road can be assured in this manner without the expenditure of sums of money quite beyond the resources of the Sardar.

I have the honour to inform you that your letter No. 30-465 and the papers forwarded under your endorsement No. 29-463 reached me at noon to-day. Immediately on their receipt I interviewed the Shaikh as directed in your letter and succeeded in bringing him to a more reasonable frame of mind with the result that before leaving him he gave me his word that, if necessary, he was prepared to pay Tumans 30,000 for the Khans’share in the Jerrahithe Aqili indemnity. Although your letter did not specifically authorize me to take this step I trust that my action will meet with your approval. 1 was anxious to have some definite basis for negotiation with Sirdar-i-Jang before leaving and His Majesty's Consul for Arabistan will not arrive in Nasiri before I leave for the meeting with the Sirdar. I am leaving on the 16th instant for Qaleh Ala and will be in ample time to catch the Sirdar there. I will not name any price to the Sirdar unless it appears to me, on taking all the circumstances into consideration, to be advisable to do so in the best interests of all concerned. I have every hope, under present circumstances, that I shall succeed in bringing the Sirdar to a reasonable frame of mind and opening the road to an amicable settlement. Extract from Ahwaz Vice'Consulate Diary No. / H. Q., dated 18th February 1913 - Condition of Country .— 2. Agha Mohamed Zaman is offering Shaikh Murteza cash in return for the property alleged to be looted in Shushter from the latter’s house last spring on the condition that he should take an oath that his property was actually looted Shaikh Murteza refuses to take an oath and demands the actual property looted. The Governor-General does not seem to interfere in this affair outwardly but was secretly trying to put Agha Mohamed Zaman in prison. The latter has become aware of this and has since discontinued going to the Government fort. 3. Shushter is disturbed. Shaikh Murteza and Mohalla Mugui have formed into one party and Mohallas Mohamed Zaman and Gargari the other. Mirza2 Mohamed Riza of Mohalla Abdulla Banoo has not yet joined any side. Agha Mohamed Zaman party pretends to take no interest in the disturbance and awaits that the Shaikh Murteza party should begin the fight first. 4. The environs of Shushter are disturbed. Thefts occur day and night. 5. Dizful is disturbed. Mohalla Masjid and Mohalla Qaleh are fighting^ against each other. 20 men have been wounded and killed on both sides during the week. A caravan consisting of 50 loaded mules belonging to Mohalla Qaleh was stopped by Mohalla Masjid while en route to Dizful from Shushter and mules and loads taken away. 6. The Shushter and Dizful troubles seem to be the result of the Sardar Arfa’s endeavours (as already reported) to draw the Bakhtiari attention in that direction. No. 29-C., dated Mohammerah, the 22nd February 1913. From— Major L. Haworth, I.A., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Arabistan, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In continuation of my No. 26-C., dated 15th February 1913, I have the honour to forward herewith a letter which Shaikh Khaz’al has asked’me to deliver to you in answer to your No. 71, dated February nth, 1913. As you are aware the Shaikh has always been absolutely reasonable in the matter ; the only difficulty that I was aware of was to get the Bakhtiari to be equally reasonable. As stated in my previous letter above referred to I do not think there should be great difficulty in getting the conditions observed. I forward herewith* also two telegrams—one from the Ain*ed-Douleh to the •win follow. Shaikh and the Shaikh’s answer in reply with reference to the present situation. Haji Rais has sent me a message by his son Haji Mushir saying that as far as he can see he will have to go and see the Sirdar Jang himself and he would like my advice and assistance, while the Shaikh has written placing a launch at my disposal so that I can get up to Nasiri immediately since the “ Malamir ” though it has been coming each day has not returned from Basrah. Translation of a letter dated 13th Rabi 1133/ (20th February IQI3), from His Excellency Shaikh Sir Khazal Khan, Sardar-i-Arfa’a, Shatkh of Moham- merah i to Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.CJ.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, A. C. Your esteemed communication dated the 4th Rabi I, has been duly received and I was extremely obliged and gratified by Your Honour’s demonstration of kindness and regards. As to what you have written on the question of the dispute of the Bakhtiari Khans m connection with Jarrahi, and the advice given by you, I beg to state that, you are firstly aware that I am desirous of maintaining peace and friend ship with every one and that I will not go beyond your instructions and advices ?bo7 v meS ' u W1 ac i cept w . I ? 1 atever y° u ma y sa y in every instance; but I believe ^ u 0I ?? r ’ u, 80 ’ W1 i r ota S , ; eethatthe Bakhtiari Khans should, every y r, bring about troubles and losses for me and my tribesmen on one pretext r A^ e ^ 0t desired t( ? P ur chase their property or to interfere with the on 1^3°/ the * Guvcrnment but when they wish to exercise highhandedness held hv mp 0 r| me * Possession of, the territories and properties held by me and my tribes, the Arabs will surely take up the defensive and checkthem. As it has become known that the Bakhtiari Khans wish to cause us such troubles and losses every year, and that they covet the property and territories of the Arabs, all the latter have been excited this year, and should the Bakhtiaris attempt to encroach upon their territories or to come to Jarrahi, the Arabs will check them and prevent their doing so in order that the Bakhtiaris may not covet the properties and territories of the Arabs hereafter. After receiving your esteemed letter, I spoke to Captain Grey, the Consul at Ahwaz (explaining) that if the Bakhtiari Khans see they have derived some profit in this transaction, they will bring about the same situation every year, in order to gain some profit and that i$ was in view of such considerations that I am not prepared to pay anything in addition to the original value. Now that Your Honour has advised me to pay them something in addition, I will agree to do so on two conditions. Firstly, that Captain Grey should take a writing from the Sirdar-i-Jang Ilkhani, as the representative of all the Bakhtiari Khans, that they will hereafter have no right to purchase properties in my juris diction, and thus to remove all the unrightful and irregular objections raised by them, in order that no dispute should exist hereafter. Secondly, while writing the deed of transfer for one half of Jarrahi, they should state therein that they have surrendered the same for the original value at which they say they have purchased it from the heirs of the late Mushir-ed- Dowleh, so that I may show the same to the Arabs (and tell them) that they have transferred it at the same price; and their Honours the Consuls for Moham* merah and Ahwaz should record their testimonies in the document. If they carry out these conditions I agree to give them something additional. I avail myself of this opportunity to assure you of my high esteem. Telegram No. 92-354, dated 28th February 1913.

With reference to letter to Shaikh and instructions to Grey referred to at end of my telegram 77-272 of nth February, I have since received temperate and satisfactory letter from Shaikh and following message from Grey, Begins : “ Post arrived yesterday and I leave for Qala Ala tomorrow. I shall be in ample time to catch Jang there. Shaikh has agreed to pay 30,000 tomans if necessary for Jarrahjii and Aqili, but stipulates that there ^ must be an understanding that Bakhtiari refrain from further inter ference in territories under his control.

Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received March 10.) (No. 37.) gi r? Tehran, February 16, 1913. AS was tlie case last year, the relations between the Bakhtiaris and the Sheikh of Mohammerah are again causing some uneasiness. Sardar-i-Jang is reported to be'at Malamir breathing warlike menaces at the head of a considerable iorce, whilst the sheikh is at Nasiri, determined, it is said, to repel any hostile Bakhtiari inroad. The khans here maintain that the force assembled at Malamir is intended to support the Governor of Behbehan in punitive measures to be directed against the Ivuhgeluis, and that there is no intention of taking any steps of a hostile nature towards the sheikh, but there is some reason to believe that the assurances given here do not, or did not, tally with the instructions sent to Sardar-i-Jang. The cause of the present quarrel is the possession of certain lands known as the Jarrahi lands that the khans acquired from Mushir-ed-Dowleh last summer, despite an agreement made with the sheikh in 1908, under which it was arranged that the sheikh alone could purchase these lands, which are clearly in the Arab country. The breach of the 1908 agreement is not so serious as it would have been, had not both parties to it already broken every one of its articles. The Jarrahi lands are divided up into two sections, one belonging to Nizam-es-Sultaneh and the other until recently to Mushir-ed-Dowleh. The sheikh holds the Nizam’s lands on a mortgage, called a friendly arrangement, and he has for some years held the Mushir’s lands on lease. The Bakhtiaris clearly acquired the lands for the sole purpose of selling them at a high price to the sheikh, who offered the Mushir-ed-Dowleh 10,000 tomans, say 2,000b, for them about three years ago, in the confident belief that no one else could or would buy them. Last year however the Bakhtiaris came forward with an offer of lo,000 tomans, say 3,000Z., which the Mushir accepted. Having bought the lands, the Bakhtiaris have had to bluff to send up the price. To do so, they have threatened to take forcible possession of the lands, with the result that the sheikh, has collected a small army to oppose them, and announces his intention of fighting. I have been endeavouring for some time to induce the khans to sell the land to the sheikh, but the former ask too much and the latter offers too little. Meanwhile, the people of Arabistan and the representatives of British interests in those parts are consideralDly alarmed lest a struggle should ensue. I have warned the khans that they will incur the grave displeasure of His Majesty’s Government if there is any breach of the peace, and 1 have hinted that we might mark our displeasure by seeking the removal from their offices of certain Bakhtiari governors. The last phase of the question was the recent dispatch of a^ telegram by Sardar Assad to Sardar-i-Jang ordering him to lease the lands to the sheikh for three years. I am personally convinced that the Bakhtiaris have no intention of fighting, but in their eagerness to bluff the sheikh into giving them a good price for the lands they have created an anxious situation which it will take some time to calm down. Another question in dispute between the parties is the amount of compensation that the sheikh should pay for damage done to Bakhtiari property at Akili, ne ^ r Shustar, last spring when the sheikh’s Arabs captured that place and pillaged the villages of Akili. The sheikh claims that no compensation is due from him, because he occupied Shustar under instructions from the Persian Government. When both parties Lave realised that the one does not mean to fight unless he is attacked, and that the other has no real intention of attacking, it may be possible for His Majesty’s consular officers on the spot to assist in the settlement ol their differences by means of an arrangement acceptable to both. _ . I have repeatedly spoken to the khans here most seriously upon this subject, and I have impressed upon them that there must on no account be any breach of the peace. It is most difficult to argue with them, because the one always endeavours to shift the responsibility on to another, whilst all profess such deep affection for Great Britain and such readiness to take immediate steps to carry out my wishes, so that nothing may be .t i2 anne to damage British interests, that the sting is taken out of my representations done to damage -onusi ’ orn r constantly nrpfed that instead of almost before I have ha ime o c ‘ . sowars WO idd be better employed in troubling the peace of Arabian, the Baktoa^ ^ brigands wh o attacked seeking for and ^nflrcting 1^0 the necessary s te p S t0 ehf Lieutenant liuliock nea p _ Bahhtiaris can reach the somewhatr, SCAihldi blood in hem that is said to have heen^responsrhle for the outrage. a ^ e ’wALTER TOWNLEY.\ ■ « CONFIDENTIAL. ^1 No. 589, dated Bushire, the 22nd February (received 3rd March) 1913.

I have received your telegram No. 67-240. I am of opinion, after many conversations with the Khans, that the only method of arriving at an agreement will be by the intervention of British Consular officers on the spot. I have impressed on the Khans that on no account must there be any breach of the peace. 1 hey assure me that their intentions are most pacific, and that full powers are possessed by the Sardar-i-Jang to deal with all questions, and that there will be no attempt to seize the Jarrahi lands by force. The Sardar Muhtasham (the Khan most nearly interested) assured me yesterday that he is quite ready to lease the Jarrahi lands to the Shaikh on the same terms as the latter made with the Mushir, or to sell him, at a fair price, his lands in Arabistan. He said with regard to the Aqili indemnity that, if the Shaikh is not willing to come to terms, he is prepared to wait until the Shaikh is more reasonable. It is very difficult to conduct an argument with these people, who profess themselves ready to make any sacrifice in order to please us. I am well aware of the fact that they are quite capable all the time of sending instructions in a contrary sense to the Sardar-i-Jang. Such being the conditions, I think the best course will be for you to send the instructions you propose to Captain Grey. I will keep on hammering at the Khans, but I cannot look for much support from the Cabinet, who realize that, for the present, they must adopt a concilia tory attitude towards the Bakhtiaris ; to coerce whom is not in their power.

He is rumoured to be sounding the Shaikh as to his willingness to exchange his zaidun property for the Jarrahi lands.50. The Shaikh of Mohammerah, notwithstanding his protestations of unpreparedness, appears to have neglected no opportunity of duly strengthening himself in view of possible hostilities with his more hardy Bakhtiari neighbours. Besides having, in the past, acquired machine guns, great stores of rifles and engaged Europeans and Egyptians qualified to instruct his Arabs, he is now busy preparing forces to despatch to Band-i-Qir Reghewa, Khirran and Jarrahi and is hiring one of the Muin’s steamers to convey troops on to the Upper Karun.

Grey, I.A., His Majesty's Vice-Consul and Assistant Resident, Ahwaz, To— Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to inform you that Doctor Young, who returned yesterday to the Oil Fields from Malamir, has brought me the following report of the attitude of Sardar-LJang with regard to the present Shaikh-Bakhtiari differences. Sardar-i-Jang has completely recovered from his recent indisposition and is leaving with a force of 1,500 Bakhtiari Tufangchis for Qaleh Ala, on the 8th instant. He is at present fully occupied with the operations against the Kuhgelus and has no thought for the Shaikh or the various questions pending in regard to Arabistan. When questioned regarding Jarrahi he emphatically asserted his intention of taking over the property and asked, in the name of justice, what reason there was why he should not do so. “ Have we not bought it and paid for it ” he said, “ and if so why should we not enjoy our property. ” As for fighting, he said that so far as he was concerned there would be none. If hostilities did break out he asserted that he would in no way be responsible He had every intention of sending his ‘ mamurs ' to Jarrahi shortly ; if they were allowed to take peacable possession all would be well, but if, on the other hand, they were forcibly resisted by the Shaikh he would have no alternative but to send a sufficient force to overcome the Shaikh’s resistance and to enable the mamurs to establish themselves in Jarrahi. ^ When asked why he had again sent Agha Rahim to see the Shaikh at Nasiri, he said that the former had not been charged with any particular mission but had been sent merely to see what the Shaikh had to say. He again denied having any intention of selling the property to the Shaikh or any one else, and asserted that the Bakhtiaris had need of the Jarrahi for their peasants who were in need of more territory in the Kishlaq. He announced his intention of proceeding to Ramuz when the Kuhgelu had been disposed of, and expected to arrive there by abaut the 20th February. The Shaikh persists in his former attitude of refusing to pay a kran more than tomans 15,000 for the Jarrahi, and announces his intention of forcibly , resisting any attempt on the part of Sardar-i-Jang to send mamurs to the property. The Shaikh has, as I have already reported, made extensive preparations at Jarrahi and throughout Arabistan for resisting the Bakhtiaris and is, I am convinced, quite prepared to carry out his threats and prevent Bakhtiari agents from reaching Jarrahi by force of arms. Whether Jang is equally sincere in asserting that he will take possession of Jarrahi is doubtful, but he may be forced to do so fof the sake of his prestige if the Shaikh continues in his present impossible attitude, and if His Majesty’s Minister fails to get the Khans in Tehran to agree to a moderate price for the property.4 If Sardar-i-Jang reaches Ram Hormuz with the Bakhtiari force which he has now under arms (some 2,500 men) before any solution has been found to the Jarrahi difficulty matters may reach a very critical pass# A copy of this letter has been sent to His Majesty’s Consul, Mohammerah.

It is some weeks since I have written to Your Excellency personally, but I have been kept fully informed by Major Haworth and Captain Grey regarding the march of events. I need not say that I have been greatly exercised as to the difficult situation which is developing between Your Excellency and the Bakhtiari Khans especially in connection with the Jarrahi lands. It is on this latter subject that I now write to you. You may rest assured in this connection that I have been in frequent communication with His Majesty’s Minister, and that he has been doing his utmost to promote an amicable solution between yourself and the Khans. But Your Excellency will realize that he is obliged to examine both sides of the question, and seeing that the Bakhtiari Khans never gave any under taking to him to sell the lands at a particular price, he does not feel in a position to fix the said price arbitrarily. Similarly, the new Cabinet, although it d^es not contain Bakhtiaris, is not in a strong enough position to ignore altogether the influence and arguments of the Khans in Tehran, or to force them to accept a particular price. All that the British Minister or the Cabinet consider that they can reasonably do is to press both parties towards a friendly settle nent. It is very necessary therefore that Your Excellency should realize the actual facts of the case, and assume in regard to the question the same statesmanlike attitude which you have displayed under our advice in regard to other difficult issues which have occurred in the past. This is a policy which has had the most satisfactory results. No doubt the Bakhtiari Khans bought the Mushir’s share of the lands in order to make some profit out of it and I do not think a solution can be reached by Your Excellency saying in advance that; “ 1 will not pay more than they gave for them and will fight rather than do that.” Satisfactory business can never be conducted on these lines. I think you should take into account the advan- tage to your administration and your prestige which will be derived from the acquisition of the land for yourself and make up your mind to pay a reasonable price for it, even if it means that the Bakhtiaris will make some profit out of their bargain. It is better that this should be the case than that you should undertake hostilities involving very great expense and loss of valuable life, theresult of which can only permanently embitter relations and create other diffi culties in the future; that is to say, that you should consider not only what was paid for the lands but also what they are worth to you. I am asking Captain Grey to endeavour to see the Sardar-i^Jang and I very much hope that he will bring back news that the Sardar is willing to negotiate with Your Excellency on reasonable lines and, if he is, I am confident that you will respond in a conciliatory spirit.

I fear position indicated by them • Enclosure,No....,,d 3. does not afford a very material basis for negotiation by local officers. Meanwhile letters received to-day from Ahwaz are also discouraging. Grey reports that Doctor Young has just returned from medical visit to Sardar-i-]ang and states that latter had recovered from indisposition and was leaving in connection with Kuhgelu matters for Qala Ala in Kuhgelu limits about 35 miles north-east of Ramuz. When questioned regarding the Jarrahi, Sardar said that lands were required by Bakhtiari for their own tribesmen and repudiated the slighest inten tion of selling them. He emphatically asserted his intention of sending mamurs to take over lands and his readiness to coerce Shaikh if any resistance was offered. Asked why he had sent Agha Rahim again to the Shaikh he replied that he had not sent him on any particular mission but merely to see what the Shaikh had to say. Meanwhile Grey is convinced that Shaikh’s intention and preparations to resist occupation by Bakhtiaris are serious. He is not quite so sure about sincerity of Sardar’s attitude, but thinks that amour fropre will oblige him to fight if Your Excellency fails get the Khans in Tehran to accept a fair price. He concludes by saying that, if before that occurs Sardar reaches Ram Hormuz with the force he now has under arms, the position will become more critical. Mail leaves to-morrow, and I am sending to Grey the instructions already authorised in case it is still possible to act on them. I am writing also to the Shaikh, but tenour of Sardar Muhtasham’s utterances is not such as to enable me to do more than exhort him to exhaust every effort towards a peaceful solu tion, and not to maintain uncompromising attitude, subject to reasonable limits, should the Sardar-i-Jang change his attitude and be prepared to negotiate for sale of lands.

Grey, I.A., His Majesty's Vice*C6nsul, Ahwaz. With reference to the papers sent to you under my office endorsement No. 29-463 of to-day’s date, I have the honour to request that on receipt of this communication you will endeavour to get into touch with the Sardar-i-Jang before he reaches Ram Hormuz and do youf utmost to inflnence him in the direction desired. 2. That is to say you should explain to him the attitude of the Khans in Tehran as indicated by the assurances given by them to His Majesty’s Minister and communicated to us in the latter’s telegrams; and remind him of his own undertakings to His Majesty’s Minister of last summer, with reference to which C91FD6 Sir Walter Townley in his telegrams of 19th July and 3rd August recorded as follows :— (1) “ The Sardar-i-Jang has promised to see that the demands of the Bakhtiaris are not excessive or unreasonable. (2) “ I am informed confidentially by the Sardar-i-Jang that the Mushir- ed-Dowleh’s share of the Jarrahi lands has been purchased by the Khans .he adds, however, that the Shaikh need not be alarmed as he proposes to arrange for the sale of the whole to the Shaikh, whom you should inform confidentially. ” (3) “ Sardar-i-Jang in any case, has full powers to accept any arrangement without reference to 1 ehran. ” 3. You might go on to say that while we consider that the precise price to be paid must be a matter of arrangement between himself and the Shaikh, yet the achievement of an amicable and equitable solution is a matter of serious concern to us. You should further point out that no solution other than one by which the land will remain in the hands of its present occupants can possibly be a lasting one, and that by the same analogy, no final solution will be effected by a resort to arms now over the question of present occupation—a course which on the contrary can only serve permanently to embitter the relations between the parties and lead to constant breaches of the peace. 4. While it is perhaps undesirable to name a price which we may afterwards have to recede from, you are generally aware that 30,000 tomans (to include compensation for the Aqili lands) would in the opinion of His Majesty's Minister and myself be a fair price. Before starting you should explain to the Shaikh the object of your mission and the general nature of your instructions.

I replied that on no account should he take any action whereby a breach of the peace might be occasioned, and that he should continue to exert himself with a view to effecting an arrangement, with the assistance of the British Consuls on the spot, should such be necessary. I have now' received from the Sardar Assad, in reply, a copy of a telegram which he has sent to the Sardar-i-Jang in which the latter is instructed to lease the lands to the Shaikh for a period of three years. This step was in no way suggested by me, and is no doubt a trick on the part of the Bakhtiari Khans to see if there will be any enhancement in the price of the lands when the prospect of railway construction becomes more defined. It is declared by the Khans here that the forces assembled by the Sardar-i- Jang are destined for punitive measures against the Kuhgelu, and are not intended as a menace to the Shaikh. This contention does not receive support from the Sardar-i-Jang’s attitude, but he is probably bluffing. I I trust that it may be possible to come to some arrangement, as all belli' cose intentions are disclaimed by the Khans here, who are well aw'are that one or more fat governorships might be lost to the family as the result of disregard of my admonitions.

Grey, I.A., His Majesty’s Vice-Consul and Assistant Resident, Ahwaz, To— Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Mohammerah telegrams Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 6, dated respectively 27th, 31st January and 2nd and 3rd February have only reached me to-day and I have the honour to submit the following remarks upon them from the Bakhtiari point of view. The Bakhtiari Khans are aware that the Shaikh four years ago refused to pay more than 10,000 tomans for the half share of the Jarrahi when approached by Mushir-ud'Dowleh. I hey point out that he then had his opportunity of purchasing the property but his meanness prevented him from taking advantage of it. They say that now that the Khans have paid half as much again as he was willing to pay he comes forward insists upon their selling to him at the price which they paid and threatens violence if they do not agree and attempt to take possession of their own. I was not aware that Sardar i-Jang had made a definite offer to the Shaikh to sell the Jarrahi for 30,000 tomans, but under the circumsiances 1 think the Shaikh would be well advised to accept the offer. The Shaikh himself does not hope under any circumstances to get the Jarrahi for less than 20,000 tomans and I would urge that it is hardly worth our while to risk estranging the Bakhtiaris in an attempt (the success of which is doubtful) to save the Shaikh a sum of £2,000. Regarding the Aqili raid and the Shaikh’s ingenious contention that the Bakhtiari Khans are themselves responsible as it was the result of their ‘ attack ’ on Shushtar, it is hard to expect the latter to see the affair in this light. They contend that if their arrival there with troops in 1912 constituted an unsuspected Bakhtiari attack on the Shaikh then Shaikh Handzal Khan’s arrival under similar circumstances in 1911 must have been an Arab attack on the Bakhtiaris as the interests of the Bakhtiaris in Shushtar are not less than those of the Shaikh and neither can claim any ownership over the town or immediate environs. Both movements were under the orders of the Persian Government as, at the time of the advance of the executive Khans, the counter orders sent at the instance of His Majesty’s Legation had not been received. The execu tive Khans naturally piid no attention to the ‘ orders ’ of the Deputy Governor when they were directly opposed to those of the Prime Minister. They look on the Aqili raid as a cowardly revenge on the part of the Shaikh when the Bakhtiaris were far from the scene of action and indeed it is hard to see it in any other light. When speaking on this subject with Sardar Muhtesham at Tehran he scoffed at the Shaikh’s assertion that the Arabs had got out of control and acted against the Shaikh’s wishes and said with a laugh that the Bakhtiaris might get out of control during the coming winter. 1 am inclined to view with some suspicion the picture as painted^ by the Shaikhs of Mohammerah and Kuwait representing the Arabs as united and ready at a word to flock to the Shaikh’s standard and repulse the hated Bakhti aris. The tribes outwardly swear allegiance to the Shaikh but there is good reason to believe that the Shaikh has many powerful enemies in his own house who would welcome an opportunity, such as the present, of freeing themselves from his con'rol The Aulad Mir Abdullah (Mir Chiefs), some of the Ka ab Chiefs and the Beni Turuf are undoubtedly disloyal. No one realizes this better than the Shaikh but it is naturally in his interests to assert the contrary as also to exaggerate the results and especially the damage to British interests which would ensue from a possible conflict with the Bakhiiaris.The remarks contained in the second paragraph of Mohatnmerah telegrarft No. 6 could with even greater force be applied to the Shaikh, i.e., that the Shaikh’s conduct towards us will, in the future as in the past, most undoubtedly be based on what is to his advantage irrespective of the present question and that his bluster vis a vis the Bakhtiaris having failed through lack of our support he will accept the situation, pay the Khans the 30,000 tomans asked and put an end to the matter in dispute.

Amir Mujahid had written to several of the Arab Chiefs announcing his intention of supporting the Shaikh in the event of hostilities with Sardar-i- Jang. These assurances are of about as much value as the similar assurances given by the Shaikh to the Amir in September when the former announced, with a flourish of trumpets, that he would support the Amir against the Kuhgelu and thus settle the question of the Bakhtiari road. * . » • » • » • (North Arabistan.) 59 Captain Grey learns on reliable authority that Shaikh Khazal is attempt ing to stir up trouble in Shushtar and Dizful with the object of diverting the attention of the Bakhtiari Khans.

IN accordance with the instructions contained in your telegram No. 733 of the 18th ultimo, I informed Sardar Assad on the 26th December that, from the information in the possession of His Majesty’s Government, it would appear that he must have been misinformed in the matter of the reported overtures that had been made to Sardar-i-Jang by Sheikh Ghazban, since that chief is not a member of the Beni Turruf tribe, but of the Beni Lam tribe, and as such is a Turkish subject, who was unlikely to have been mixed up in such an affair as an intrigue against the Sheikh of Mohammerah. Sardar Assad at once maintained that the information that had reached him was perfectly correct, that it was true that Sheikh Ghazban is a Beni Lam and a Turkish subject, but that he had fled from Turkish territory and taken refuge with the Beni Turruf. Whilst their guest he had for reasons of his own intrigued so successfully against the Sheikh of Mohammerah as to induce the entire Beni Turruf and a half of three other Persian Arab tribes to combine in a movement against him. He had thereupon made overtures to the Sardar-i-Jang with a view to getting the Bakhtiaris to join in an expedition which was intended to destroy the sheikh’s power once for all. Sardar-i-Jang passes for being a friend of the sheikh, but presumably the bait offered was too alluring, because, Sardar Assad asserts, he was sorely tempted to accept the offer made by Sheikh Ghazban. On the matter being brought to the notice of the khans at Tehran, stringent instructions had been telegraphed to Sardar-i-Jang, Sardar Assad said, ordering him on no account to lend himself to a breach of the peace, but to advise the malcontent Arabs to make up their differences with the Sheikh of Mohammerah. It would appear from a subsequent telegram xeceived from His Majesty’s consul at Mohammerah that there was considerable foundation for the report that reached me. Major Haworth states that the Sheikh of Mohammerah has now heard from the Mali of Bussorah that the Mutessarif of Amara has learned that Ghazban has returned to the Beni Lam, to whom he has stated that the Bakhtiari chief, Sardar-i-Jang, has sent him an emissary, who made various promises, in order to induce him to co-operate in an attack on the Sheikh of Mohammerah; and that Ghazban, who is once more on good terms with the Turkish authorities, had asked for advice as to the nature of the reply he should make, and had been told that he should do nothing. It would, therefore, appear clear that there was some intrigue on foot, of which each party accuses the other of being the instigator. As the movement has come to naught, it has but an academic interest, but it unfortunately reveals the fact that the good relations believed to have been established between the Bakhtiaris and Sheikh Khazal have rotten foundations. For this reason, and because I have been informed by His Majesty’s consul at Mohamraerah that the arrangement made by Rahim Khan, the Bakhtiari emissary, between the Sheikh of Mohammerah and the Bakhtiari khans has been repudiated by Sardar-i-Jang, I impressed very forcibly upon Sardar Assad that His Majesty’s Government would be extremely displeased if there was any breach of the peace. _ I urged him to send the strictest injunctions to the khans on the spot to make all possible endeavour to settle the questions in dispute amicably. Sardar Assad promised me that he would do so, but he took the opportunity to ' complain very bitterly of Sheikh Khazal, who, he said, had become intolerably over bearing in consequence of his belief that he would have the support of His Majesty’s Government whatever might happen. He said that his people had no wish to fight, but that the situation was becoming almost unbearable, because the sheikh would not be reasonable, and would only become so if the British consuls used their influence with him ; and he urged that, should it be found impossible to come to an agreement on any specific^ points, they should be referred to the arbitration of His Majesty’s Legation here, in the impartiality of which the khans would have perfect confidence. [2804 k —21] k :I replied that I much hoped that it would he found possible to come to a satisfactory arrangement on the spot and that the question of referring disputed points here could stand over until occasion demanded its serious consideration. The arrangement made by Rahim Khan was conditional upon its acceptance and ratification by Sardar-i-Jang. It is most vexatious that he, after consultation with the ^ khans here, has been unable to confirm it; but as it was concluded subject to his approval, I do not quite agree with His Mnjesty s consul at klohammerah that his refusal to do so shows bad faith, even if his negtiatior had his full powers. _ From the information that has reached me from the south, I am afraid that the situation in the Bakhtiari country is far from satisfactory ; that Sardar-i-Jang appears disinclined to undertake the necessary measures to overawe the Kuhgeluis ; and that Amir Mujahid has done nothing at Behbehan to make himself felt.

The meaning of “ Market value” in a case like this is not quite clear to me. One would presume that the market value in August last was what the Mushir- ud-Dowleh received for the lands. Apart from that, however, it seems that some guide would be afforded by the rent that the Shaikh pays to the Nizam for his share. Please let me know by telegraph what your views are on this point, after consulting the Shaikh, or Haji Rais, or some other knowledgable person.

Grey, I.A., His Majesty’s Vice-Consul and Assistant Resident, Ahwaz, To— Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to forward herewith translation of a letter received to-day from Sardar-i-Jang regarding the property looted from Bakhtiari peasants and proteges in Aqili, Dizful and Shushtar.Criticism of the letter is unnecessary but it may be noted that the Sardar in expressing his desire for a Consular meeting appears to think that the only matter to be discussed at the meeting is the amount of compensation to be paid by the Shaikh for the damage caused to Bakhtiari property in Northern Arabistan. He appears to desire that we should investigate the claims of the Bakhtiari rayats on the spot and determine the amount that the Shaikh should pay as compensation. As the only evidence obtainable to decide a question of this nature would be from the Bakhtiari peasants concerned, I need scarcely say that it would be an impossible task to arrive at a just conclusion as to the damage actually suffered. Dated 22nd Moharram/1331 = ist January 1913. From— Sardar-i-Jang, Malamir, To— Captain Grey, Ahwaz. As regards the property looted from Shushtar, Aqili and Dizful villages occupied by rayats of Ba%iari family, about which we spoke personally and arrangements were made that it should be returned. The value of this property is great. I have heard that Rahim Khan, Arshad-ud-Dowleh went to the Sardar-i- Arfa’ and that for his own benefit had conversations with the Shaikh without our information and permission. Alpart of the looted property which was worth nothing and of no use has been recovered from the Arabs and brought (by Rahim Khan) to Shahwali. He then asked a few of the Bakhtiari headmen chiefly concerned to go and see the recovered property and take away whatever belonged to them. They went and saw that instead of big and new black tents, new good carpets, and other valuable property, old rotten tents, namads (felts) all in pieces and other things of no value had been collected. As these were of no use to any one, they refused to take them. I wrote to them not to interfere with this (recovered) property and that the question be kept pending till I reach Ab Bid. I give the information first to you for communication by telegraph to Consul (General) Bushire so that he may come to Ab Bid or Aqili accompanied by you, when the looted property may be returned according to justice and law. Various enquiries have been made from Tehran regarding recovery of the looted property and I have given replies to them that at present I am busy at Malamir and after having finished my work here will go to Ab Bid and take up the question of the recovery of the looted property. The Sardar-i-Arfa’ has repeatedly written to me shewing his desire to send his son to me with Haji Rais. I have replied that the question of the property looted from Bakhtiari proteges in Shushtar, rayats in Aqili and villages near Dizful belonging to us and other Bakhtiari Khawanins should be investigated according to law and settled first. After that it makes no difference to me whether the Shaikh’s son and Haji Rais visit me or not. The chief point is the return of the looted property. , _ Seal of SARDAR-I-JANG.

No. 8-C., dated Mohammerah, the 18th January 1913. From— Major L. Haworth, I.A., His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Arabistan, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In continuation of my letter No. 2-C., dated nth instant, I have the honour to send herewith a letter No. n-37, dated 13th January 1913, u.f. s. from His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Ahwaz with reference to the Bakhtiari-Shaikh-Ghazban incident, and forwarding a copy of a letter from Sardar Jang to Shaikh Ghazban. I would not say however that it was on this letter that Ghazban bases his statement that he was approached by the Bakhtiari Khans with the proposal that he should join in attacking the Shaikh of Mohammerah. This letter, which has been sent to the Shaikh, is produced as proof that Sardar Jang communicated with Shaikh Ghazban. Former correspondence will show that the proposals were made through one Sadiq Khan who was the bearer of the letter in question. The latter part of the letter bears out what the Shaikh has frequently stated to me, that Bakhtiari agents are always sending reports to the Khans that certain Arabs are ready to join them in any hostile movement against the Shaikh. On the information, thus received, the Khans approach the Arabs concerned. Occasionally, as in the case of Farhan Assad, they succeed in detaching the man, if he thinks that he has a grievance but, generally speak ing, the attempts fail and are reported to the Shaikh whose feelings towards the Bakhtiari are not improved thereby. The attitude of Shaikh Ghazban can be determined from the fact that he reported the proposals of Sardar Jang, made through Sadiq Khan, to the Mutessarif of Amareh and has now sent the Sardar Jang’s letter to the Shaikh. Haji Rais points out that the form of this letter shows that it is the original overture and not in answer to anything received. A copy of this letter has been sent to Ahwaz.

It will be noted however that in this letter Sardar Jang states that Rahim Khan “had conversation with the Shaikh without our information and permis sion.” With my No- 2-C., dated nth instant, I forwarded the Sardar Jang’s own letters introducing Rahim Khan. The Bakhtiari disregard of documentary evidence is amazing and I previously had cause to remark on this subject in letter No. Q, dated 3rd November 1911, which I addressed to the Minister at Tehran and of which a copy was sent to you under my No. 94-C. of November yuh of that vear A dominant note throughout all the negotiations, questions and statements in connection with the Shaikh and Bakhtiari has been the consist ency of statement and of purpose of the Shaikh and the hopeless inconsistency and^unreliability of the Bakhtiari Khans. It is this unreliability which has made any arrangements between the two parties impossible and which has now forced us to take up the matter ourselves to save the situation going from bad to worse.

While expressing desire for meeting of Consular officers he affects to consider that their only function w'ould be to examine Bakhtiari witnesses in regard to alleged damage done at Aqili and pronounce upon the compensation to be paid by the Shaikh. Referring; to the repeated offers of the Shaikh to send his son and Haji Rais to confer with him, Sardar says that the first essential is that the Aqih claims should be settled and paid according to above procedure and that when that is accomplished it is a matter of indifference to him whether son and Haji come or not. Comment is superfluous. Our great object is to achieve some definitive settlement between the parties and both Haworth and Grey agree that the best solution will be for Your Excellency to intervene on the lines suggested in my telegram 16-57. I beg you to reconsider possibility of doing that should you have no success with Ministers. I hope to telegraph a basis for valuation very shortly. Telegram P. No. 3, dated 27th January 1913 (despatched via Basrah). p rom —His Majesty’s Consul, Mohammerah, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. Shaikh and Bakhtiari question and Your Excellency’s telegram No. 23 to Resident and latter’s reply No. 39. As long as the Bakhtiaris were in power I did not consider the legal aspect of the case worth taking up. Now I have advised the Shaikh that he had better send telegrams to the Prime Minister and the Ministry of Justice declaring the sale of the Jarrahi lands to be invalid on the ground that he was not allowed his right of pre-emption at the price at which sold. I trust this will be of assistance to Your Excellency in determining the matter with the Ministers.The Shaikh was in correspondence with the Mushir-ed-Dowleh some four years ago in connection with the purchase of his charge for 10,000 tomans. This fact, taken with the purchase of the Bakhtiaris at 15,000, gives what may be considered a fair indication of the true value of the property at issue. Thirty-thousand tomans is being demanded by the Sardar-i-Jang. Mushir- ed-Dowleh has presumably got the title deeds. Telegram P., No, 44, dated (and received) 29th January 1913. From—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Shaikh and Bakhtiari. It is contended by the Mushir-ed-Dowleh that as no part of the property was owned by the Shaikh, no right of pre-emption over the remainder was possessed by him, but notwithstanding this he offered to sell the Shaikh the lands some two years ago. Of this proposal nothing came because the Shaikh would not offer more than 10,000 tomans. I am unable to agree with the contention contained in Major Haworth’s telegram No. 3 that a fair indication of the real value of the property is given by the price paid by the Bakhtiaris and that offered by the Shaikh. The former was probably trading on the restrictions laid down as to purchase laid down in the agreement of 1908 and the estate was sold by the Mushir-ed-Dowleh to the Bakhtiaris for what he could get as the lands were useless to him. This does not alter the fact that they have in reality an intrinsic value much greater than even the 30,000 tomans which is stated by Major Haworth to be the price which the Sardar-i-Jang is prepared to accept for them. A preposterously higher price is put on the lands in question by the Khans at Tehran. It seems to me that it might be possible to effect a deal at this price, the claim for damage done at Aqili being included in the bargain, and the Khans being left to fight out the question of distribution among themselves. I am assured that any terms made by the Sardar-i-Jang, to whom I am telegraphing direct, will be accepted by the Khans. A hare to the effect that the Shaikh is preparing a large force at Nasiri with guns worked by Egyptian artillerymen has been got hold of by the Persian Government, who have also heard that the Shaikh of Kuwait has arrived. They state that their information does not come from Bakhtiari sources. I scouted the possibility of the Shaikh taking such action, being without information on the subject. Mohammerah and Ahwaz may kindly be communicated the above telegram. Extract from Ahwaz Vice-Consulate Diary No. a for the week ending 14th January igtg.

From—-His Majesty’s Consul, Mohammerah, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran (repeated Resident). I have the honour to refer to Your Excellency’s telegram No. 44 to the Resident in the Persian Gulf. With reference to my contention that a fair indication of the value of the Jarrahi lands is afforded by the price the Bakhtiari paid for them, I would point out that if the Mushir-ud-Do^ileh had wished to get the best price he could, he would have told the Shaikh that the Khans had offered 15,000 tomans, in order to see whether the Shaikh would bid higher. He did not do so, no doubt under fear of the Bakhtiari. I do not think that the 30,000 tomans which has been suggested is a fair price for the Shaikh to pay, nor do 1 think that he would accept it. His contention with regard to the Aqili question has not as yet had full consideration. He points out that he was attacked in spite of promises to the contrary made to the Legation, and in spite of the fact that executive Khans had been informed by me that if they attacked Shushtar they would be responsible for all that occurred, whilst they were told not to come to that town by the Deputy Governor, {vide my telegram No 14, dated April 24th, 1912).The incident at Aqili was the result of the Shaikh’s being obliged to collect men to repulse an unexpected attack, and the Shaikh has my support in consi dering that executive Khans responsible for all that happened, which resulted from the Shaikh’s acting in self defence.

As reported in my diary of November 9 th the Shaikh brought in s Egyptians to grow cotton and also has a staff of four Italian electricians some of whom have gone to Ahwaz and are now being employed to train the Shaikh’s artillerymen in case of an attempt on the part of the Bakhtiari to use force. The Shaikh of Kuwait, who is most indignant at the treatment being meted out to his friend, tells me that he is prepared to assist the Shaikh of Mohammerah with all the money and arms at his disposal, whilst all the latter’s headmen are now collected at Nasiri in readiness to give the signal to their tribes, should the Bakhtiari advance on the Jarrahi lands : up to the present, however, he has only collected some 3,000 or 4,000 men. Shaikh Mubarak considers that should hostilities occur, the Shaikh will be assisted by every Arab in the district of whatever nationality. I should not be surprised to see 30,000 Arabs in the field, if the Bakhtiari persist in their present line of action. Telegram P., No. 6, dated 3rd (received 4th) February 1^13. From—-His Majesty's Consul, Mohammerah, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. (Repeated Resident, Bushire). Shaikh and Bakhtiari .—I have already ventured to submit, with great respect, the view that very great harm will accrue to our local interests if we do not support the Shaikh. I am aware that Your Excellency has grounds for not wishing to thwart the Bakhtiari Khans, but I take the liberty of suggesting: Firstly .—That the future conduct of the Bakhtiari Khans will be dictated solely by their own convenience, irrespective of the present matter. Secondly .—That being orientals, and above all being Bakhtiaris, when they find that their bluster has failed in its object, they will accept the situation, once they realize that we shall not permit them to move against the Shaikh, especially as they are fully aware of our special position in regard to the Shaikh. Indeed it would appear that some recognition of this last point is called for: had not there been some great advantages to be derived, our assurances to the Shaikh would not have been given, but reciprocal obligations are entailed there by, and we have reaped a harvest by convincing the Shaikh of our good faith and of our good intentions towards him. He is receiving this week the thanks of His Majesty’s Government for his good will in giving us the option over the Khor Musa ; last summer he received the thanks of the Minister for Foreign Affairs for his attitude over me frontier question ; he obtained land for our railways in the south in the spring, and he has recently given us a valuable plot of land for a Consulate. The state of mind which these actions pre-supposes is an asset of no small value. It has been stated by Your Excellency that we have the Shaikh under our thumb. This condition of affairs has not come to pass without careful nurturing, and is built on his confidence in us, which, if we fail in our word, or in the spirit of it, will be greatly shaken. I told him when he was nervous regarding the Bakhtiari that he might rest assured, as we never broke our word. If he (and as a result also the Shaikhrif Kuwait) comes to think that we are only fair weather friends, I would submit that the consequences for our policy in the Persian Gulf will be very grave. I feel convinced that if we told the Bakhtiaris that in our own interests we could not allow them to break the peace in Arabistan and that we should have to arbitrate if they themselves would not come to an arrangement with the Shaikh, no bad effect would be produced, indeed it was what both sides agreed to in 1908. When the Prime Minister, a Bakhtiari Khan, on the occasion of the recent troubles with the junior Khans, had to come to you for assistance, that afforded an example of your influence with the Khans, and indeed I have private information that it was only such intervention that settled the matter. You will see from my telegram No. 5 » that if it comes to a fight no half measures are intended by the Shaikh, but if it comes to that point we shall have lost much. Already the Arab tribes have begun to doubt us. It ^ would seem beyond doubt that the Bakhtiari would at once give in. The incident which has been referred to indicates the nature of Bakhtiari action in the case of it being neces sary to insist actively; if it came to the point the Khans would realize that it would do them more injury if they were on bad terms. Your Excellency’s decision will naturally be based on more ample informa* tion than is at my disposal, but I feel bound to lay before you the situation as it appears locally, since there is no doubt that we are losing ground With the Arabs. Telegram P., No. 4, dated (and received) 5th February 1913* From—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—His Majesty’s Consul, Mohammerah. (Repeated Bushire, No. 54). I have received your telegrams 4, 5 and 6. The necessity of giving support to the Shaikh, both because he has maintained order during troublous times in a province in which important British interests are engaged, and because he has recently given us practical proof of his good-will, is fully realized by me, but we must, I think, be careful not to permit our natural predilection for a trusted friend to warp our judicial faculty, because the other party concerned, as Sir P. Cox has rightly termed it, is a “ hydra headed monster ” on whose word no reliance can be placed. I gather from the Mushir that he was thoroughly sick of the way in which the Shaikh had treated him, and was for this reason glad to sell the lands in question to the Khans. Though the Mushir-ud-Dowleh is a Cabinet Minister to-day, he is in office against his will, and although he is a Persian, he is not the kind of person who would be influenced by any fear of Bakhtiari pressure. However important it may be to preserve order in Arabistan, it must not be forgotten that to (bring undue pressure to bear ?) on the Bakhtiari may over balance the whole concern, in the present tottering state of the Persian Govern ment. It is true that in the Shushtar incident last spring it was primarily the Bakhtiaris who were the aggressors, but when the Shaikh’s people entered it the former had practically abandoned the town under pressure from this Legation, (a pressure for applying which the present Minister of Interior has earned their undying hatred) ; the damage done at Aqili was in consequence wanton pillage, for which it is proper and just that the Shaikh should be held responsible. I have sent a personal telegram to the Sardar-i-Jang asking him to arrange the Jarrahi business, and I have received repeated assurances from the Khans in Tehran that no attempt will be made to seize the lands in question by force. I consider that you make rather too much of the Rahim Khan agreement; by your own showing, it would seem clear that it was subject to ratification by the Sardar-i-Jang, and it seems to me that the latter was within his rights in refusing to do so, when it was seen that the settlement was not one to the taste of the Khans.10 I scarcely consider that you were jusitified in listening to the Shaikh of Kuwait’s assertions that he was prepared to send money and arms into a friendly neighbouring State, to assist a friend in waging war, without making some remonstrance. Your report makes it clear that the Shaikh of Mohammerah is preparing a considerable force, (as the Persian Government have been informed by telegraph) and I hardly see under present circumstances how I can give sanction, as Sir P. Z. Cox has requested, for the importation of 2,000 rifles. It seems to me that the Shaikh’s aggressive attitude is more provocative than that of the Sardar-i-' Jang, who, on the one hand, is blamed for omitting» to take certain punitive measures, and on the other hand is blamed for collecting a force, on the assump tion that it is his intention to attack the Shaikh. - v ’ •' • ) '■ •• ~ Provided that no aggressive action is taken by the Shaikh, I feel sure that no breach of the peace will occur, but l feel convinced that the result of any attempt on my part to force an arbitrary settlement on the Khans would be a truce of short duration, as the Khans would seek some excuse to wreak vengeance on the Shaikh. I will again bring all my influence to bear on the Khans, but it seems to me that the onlyfphance of reaching a settlement which will have some prospect of being durable, will be by the intervention of yourself and His Majesty’s Vice- Consul, Ahwaz. Telegram P., No. 67-240 dated 6th February 19«3. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. Please see your telegram No. 4 to Mohammerah. Shaikh and Bakhtian. I take it that it has now been definitely decided by Your Excellency that you cannot settle the question of the Jarrahi lands arbitrarily, and that it is desired by you that His Majesty’s Consular Officers at Mohammerah and Ahwaz should bring the parties to terms. ~ It would, however, seem that they need to be given some specific sailing directions to work upon, and that it is now the time for these to be issued. You seemed in your telegram No. 44 to my address to consider that a possible figure would be 30,000 tomans, (the Aqili compensation being included) and 1 concur with you in considering that that would offer a reasonable solution. If when the time comes you can press that view, I would suggest that authorization be now accorded to me to instruct Captain Grey to visit the Sardar- i-Jang (who is at the moment temporarily detained at Malamir by sickness, but in any case purposes shortly to go to the fields) and to endeavour to induce him to accept this figure in principle. Simultaneously I would point out to the Shaikh the weak point of his case, and recommend him, and instruct His Majesty’s Consul, Mohammerah, to do his best to guide him, in a similar direction. i ■ «-p» 4 ii'i; .. h p £ - ,1 hese proceedings, however, will be of little avail unless Your Excellency, and indeed the cabinet, feel in a position to assume vis-a-vis the Khans in Tehran, a similar attitude. \ I will await a further communication from Your Excellency on the subject. id . .

Should you desire to enquire after this sincere friend, it is now two days since l have arrived at the villages of Keyer and will. God willing, proceed to Chaqakhor in a couple of days. As regards all the affairs and the removal of those respected gentlemen’s annoyance and displeasure, I have spoken with my respected uncle, the Arshad- ud-Dowleh, at a great length, so that he may represent to His Excellency the Sardar-i-Arfa’a in writing or verbally, and an arrangement may be made with my said uncle in order that these displeasures should be removed and changed into friendliness, as desired by this humble and by the Arshad-ud-Dowleh, and a friendly relation may be established and maintained. As he is my delegate and as I have said and promised to him what I ought, there is no need for any detail and recapitulation. Your sincere friend, NASEER, Bakhtiari. The above is in the Sardar-i-Jang’s handwriting. An enclosure in the handwriting of the Sardar«i-Jang {forwarded) with the Arshad-ud-Dowleh. His Honour the Arshad-ud-Dowleh is an eloquent delegate and an honest representative. Apart from the friendly relations of the whole family, he will represent (to you) my personal cordiality, provided that the proceedings and the actions of Your Excellency’s officials should be inspired with straightforwardness and that you should reparate the proceedings taken two months ago, so that, God willing, the general alliance be completed. This humble has due knowledge of_ everywhere and of all affairs, and I also knew the extent of Your Excellency’s kind regards and you also demonstrated these during the conclusion of the agreement with the Amir Mujahid. I nder this circumstance my personal object is this that nothing but straightforwardness, fair play and good behaviour should be noticed on Your Excellency s part. Whatever you may desire, the means (of performing it) will be prepared. Your honoured mind should be at rest. God willing, when we become neighbours, C80FDyou will notice, both secretly and openly, the friendly services of myself and of His Honour the Arshad-ud-Dowleh. Your sincere friend, NASEER, Bakhtiari. An enclosure from the Sardar-i-Jang (forwarded) with the Arshad-ud-Dowleh. You are of course aware that the Arshad-ud-Dowleh made negotiations, efforts and endeavours at Tehran last year with a view to strengthening the friend ship and cordiality between these two great families and caused numerous writings to be issued from their honours the members of the (Bakhtiari) family and came over to Bakhtiari with a view to giving effect to the purports of the same. The Shushtar incident and the displeasure between Your Excellency and the respected Khans obstructed the discussion of those affairs. I have now stated to him certain matters which are necessary for the unity and concord of these two families, and he will represent them to Your Excel lency. ^ It is obvious that you will accept them and that in the same way as I have given definite promise to his honour the Arshad-ud-Dawleh, Your Excellency will also give him the same in strengthening the relation of unity and concord, so that the friendship (existing) between us may be stronger hereafter.

From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To-ms Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. (Repeated’ Mohammerah and Ahwaz by mail M V l degram , I2 - 28 ' The letters '’ hi ch I was expecting from Grey missed mail and have only now reached me. He says that wherefs the Shaikh (now n I! jat Ahwaz) says he will fight sooner than pay a kran more than the 15,000 tomans for the Jarrahi lands, and whereas the Sardar-i-Jang declares that under no circumstances will he sell the Jarrahi lands, he himself is confident that they are both bluffing and that in pressing for the meeting each is confident that if there is one, his claims will have our support. That is as it should be. Grey thinks that our Consuls, if a meeting is held, will merely assist at the haggling over the price both in the case of the Jarrahi lands and Aqili, and con siders, as I did, that if the Consuls attend, it should be to negotiate a general compact of peace subsequent to and apart from the above. He expresses his view that such an agreement is to be desired, even if not likely to last long, but he doubts whether our officers can usefully assist in this connection beyond witnessing and giving official sanction to the agreement arrived at between the parties, As regards the Jarrahi he suggests that a possible compromise might be found, an exchange of the Shaikh’s Zaidan properties for the Bakhtiari share of tne Jarrahi lands. I am rather inclined to think that this will introduce a fresh complication and prefer to adhere entirely to proposal made in my telegram No. 19-57, dated 8th January, to you. Once you have arbitrated the price for the Jarrahi, the parties can do as they like about giving or accepting payment partly or wholly in the form of the Zaidan lands, which, as far as we know here, the Shaikh only holds as security for money lent to the Bakhtiari. Addressed Minister, repeated Mohammerah and Ahwaz by post. Telegram P., No. 23, dated (and received) 16th January 1913. From—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to reply to your telegrams Nos. 16 and 25. The Ghazban incident can be left out of account. It is clear that it was an old story which the Khans raked up to suit their own book. The question of the Jarrahi lands is a very difficult one. The agreement of 1908, on the subject between the Shaikh and the Bakhtiaris is repudiated by the Sardar Assad because he neither signed it nor approved of it, and by the other Khans because they say it has become a dead letter both parties to it having equally broken every clause in it. The signatories of it who are in Tehran also agree that they had not full powers to conclude an agreement, such as are now possessed by the Sardar Jang. With regard to the price, I do not think that the figure paid to the Mushir can be taken as a fair price because a nominal rent only was received by him from the Shaikh. The lands have no value it is clear, to any one but the Shaikh and the Bakhtiaris under existing circumstances and the latter, aware of this, seized the chance to buy them for a song and are determined to make the Shaikh play a different tune. !t was tricky of them, and annoying, but it was a bit slow of the Shaikh to allow himself to be forestalled as he should have known by experience that too implicit reliance could not be placed on agreements made with the Khans and it is to be presumed that the Mushir-ed-Dawleh would have sold the lands as readily to the Shaikh as to the Bakhtiaris. The lands are valued by the Khans at 200,000 tomans. Possibly I could reduce this figure to 40,000 or 50,000 tomans but I am unable for various reasons to impose an arbitrary price as you suggest. In the first place they would probably refuse to obey me, in the second place, I should alienate what is still an important political asset by doing so. The Khans are not under my thumb as the Shaikh is under yours. _ The Sardar Assad said the other day in discussing matters “ Prime Ministers, Ministers, and Governors you can turn out with impunity, but you estrange the whole tribe if you touch tribal interests. ” This was an allusion to the common belief that it is largely due to me that the late Bakhtiari cabinet has had to j regain office.Under these circumstances, I am of opinion that it would be much better for the parties on the spot to endeavour to reach an arrangement with the help of the advice of our Consular officers. The Legation here would have no means of keeping the Bakhtiari up to the terms of such a treaty as you suggest might be come to between the two sides. It was unfortunate that I placed reliance on the Sardar Jang’s word in regard to the Jarrahi lands but at that time I did not known the Bakhtiaris as well as I now do, nor did l realize the magnitude of the question at issue. I am given to understand that the Khans here have recently been exchang ing more friendly telegrams with the Shaikh. Telegram P., No. 39-119, dated 19th January 1913* F rom —The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. With reference to your telegram No. 23 I should point out that I quoted the article in the agreement of 1908 not to suggest that the agreement was binding on the parties, but in order to show the view that was then and is now locally taken in regard to the status of the Jarrahi lands. In this connection I venture to offer a few supplementary observations on past history as set forth in the Arabistan precis. (1) We must regard the Jarrahi lands as being in the hereditary occupa tion of the Kaab tribe (page 8): and it may be noted that the tribal interests now touched are not those of the Bakhtiari but those of the Arabs. (2) At the time of Shaikh Khazal’s accession the lands were the subject of acute issue, and a conflict was only prevented by a settlement in the Shaikh’s favour by the present Mushir’s father, who was then Premier. (Page 19). (3) It will be seen from page 27 that the principle of non-alienation of lands from its hereditary occupants has always been recognized; it is probable moreover that the Mushir’s title deeds, if examined, would indicate that he had no right to sell without the authority of the State. Please also ask the Director of Telegraphs to let you see a telegram which passed through on the 14th to the Mushir from the Shaikh, which shows how the matter stands between them, and indicates that the right of pre-emption was not offered to the Shaikh. The Mushir is a member of the Cabinet. Can he not be pressed to emulate his father, and see that, as an act of State, these lands are left as before in the hands of their hereditary owners. (4) It will be seen from page 69 that we have accepted from the Shaikh a pledge for first option for irrigation concessions in the lands, which are watered by the Jarrahi. Arshad-ud-Dowleh's credentials .—I have received copies of these since I last telegraphed to you, and if you wish can telegraph the text of the same en clair. They are so worded that any reasonable man would be warranted in considering that the envoy was fully instructed and empowered to negotiate subject to final confirmation. I still await a reply from Major Haworth as regards the share owned by the Nizam and the revenue of rent paid on his portion. You may perhaps, after considering the above, see your way to discussing this serious issue with the Minister of Interior and the Mushir, a course w r hich might enable Your Excellency to give me material for a reply to the Shaikh, which will be compatible with the assurances given to him in the past, and with the immediate needs of the present. Perhaps you will also apprise me of your final views as to the desirability, having regard to all the circumstances, of perservering with the joint meeting. C80FD—44—6-2-13—GCBP Simla.CONFIDENTIAL.

Situation in South Persia — •••**** 1 be g inform Your Excellency that I was recently handed a memo randum by His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Ahwaz, in which the view is incidentally expressed in connection with the main question of restoration of security on the Bakhtiari road, that the Sardar-i-Jang is neither able nor disposed to undertake those military operations against the Kuhgilus which were the primary factor of his mission, and further that neither the Amir Mujahid nor any other Bakhtiari Khan is likely to succeed where he has failed. I I should like also to remind Your Excellency that no steps have yet been taken, as far as we know, to ensure the exemplary punishment of the Kuhgilii who were responsible for the attack on Lieutenant Bullock {vide announcementin your telegram No. 576, dated November 1st, to Foreign Office). The result of the incident might easily have been the same as in the case of Eckford, and as you are aware the Indian orderly of Lieutenant Bullock has since died of his wounds. •**#•** I would mention that the value of British merchandise robbed on the Ahwaz- Ispahan road during the past two years exceeds that of goods robbed on all the southern roads collectively during the same period. Extract from a telegram No. jop, dated 28th December IQ12, from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. ******* To infer from the Bullock incident that Sardar-i-Jang has failed to restore order on the Bakhtiari road is perhaps hardly fair. It is unfortunate that Captain Grey represented the work done by the Sardar-i-Jang in such a difficult light to you to the picture he drew to me of the Sardar’s ability and energy. It helps materially to a true appreciation of a situation if reports are consistent, and had I been in possession of the views of Captain Grey, as expressed to you, I should have opposed both Lieutenant Bullock’s journey and that of Major Cox. Reports from Ispahan, unprejudiced by the Khans here, say that a severe defeat has been inflicted on the expedition sent to punish the assailants of Lieute nant Bullock. It is stated that Sardar-i-Jang is now preparing a more extensive movement against the Kuhgilu. I have had no time to have the (records?) carefully examined, but I think that, if the value of goods previously robbed on the Bakhtiari road during the last two years exceeds the value of robberies on the other southern roads it must have been due to one special raid when a large accumulation of goods was carried off. I have no brief for the Ahwaz-Ispahan road, but surely robberies on the Shiraz road must have been far more frequent and illegal tolls more extortionate ? Otherwise the unsavoury reputation of the latter has been most unjustly earned. Extract from a telegram No. 305-1504, dated sgth December 1QI2, from the Politicat Resident in the Persian Gulf, to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. I I regret that my quotation of Captain Grey should have conveyed the impression that he was inconsistent: this is not really the case. His observations were dated December 8th, 6 weeks after the Bullock incident, and subsequent to the arrival at Ispahan of Major Cox, and were based on the developments, or rather the discouraging absence of them, since his despatch of the 23rd Septem ber, No. 22, in which his hopes were clearly based primarily on Amir Mujahid’s success in obtaining control of the Kuhgilu. Since then, the Sardar-i-Jang had passed into the low country without having made any attemp to inflict punish ment on the Kuhgilu, whilst the Amir Mujahid had also signally failed up to date to coerce them, or even to induce their Chiefs to come in for discussion. It was not my intention to suggest that the missions of the above mentioned Khans had already failed. It was promised by Captain Grey, and I concur, that to pass a verdict at this stage would be premature, and that it is still conceivable that they may succeed, but he concluded his remarks as follows Begins — “ If the Kuhgilu continue out of control, 1 do not think that Jang can or will keep the road safe, without the use of force, I do not think the Kuhgilu can be got in hand, and I do not think it likely thatforce will be used against them. If I am right in my suppositions, we may, I think, abandon hope of any other Khan or Khans succeeding where Jang has failed. ” I concur that on the whole the condition of the Bakhtiari road j s by n0 means so unsatisfactory as that of the Bushire-Shiraz road; what I wished to ; demonstrate was that for the Bakhtiari to keep their own road in order and thereby fulfil their obligations to the Persian Government was a task ot quite sufficient urgency and difficulty, without their intervening in questions connected with the Bushire road, and thereby introducing into the political situation ot Pars fresh complications.

Following from Grey, dated 34th December :— Begins — Amir Mujahid beyond collecting of sum of 19,000 tomans from the town and environs of Behbehan has accomplished nothing. His influence is not felt beyond the precincts of the town and his presence has produced no effect what ever on the Kuhgilu Chiefs. It is now evident that he cannot hope to get the Kuhgilu tribes in hand by peaceful methods. Whether Sardar-i-Jang will go to the expense of a military expedition, or whether such an expedition would prove successful is extremely doubtful. Extract from a telegram No. 3, dated January 6th, igigyfrom His Majesty s Minister, Tehran, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. **»•**• I am informed by the Sardar Assad that a report has been received from the Amir Mujahid that the Kuhgilu are submissive to him, a statement in which the Sardar Assad is inclined to place some credence, in view of the fact^ that the Amir Majahid is related by marriage to many of the most important Chiefs, and that they are well disposed him. The Sardar Assad is by no means confident that the Sardar-i-Jang would be victorious over the Kuhgilu, were he to initiate military operations against them, because they are the strongest and most warlike tribe in Persia, but he expressed himself as confident that the Sardar-i-Jang will be able to keep them off the road and prevent further acts of brigandage. With a view to overawing the Kuhgilu has a large force with him. *»•«*** Some days previously I was told by the Sardar Assad that Sardar-i-Jang has not yet been able to discover the exact identity of the assailants of Lieutenant Bullock: it is suspected by him that they were Bakhtiaris, and he swears that they shall be discovered and suitable punishment meted out to them. I have been enabled, thanks to your representations, to tell the Sardar Assad that I could not place much faith in the Bakhtiari, when they are neither able to keep order at home, nor to avenge the commission on an unoffending traveller of a dastardly assault.Extract from a letter No. 128-533, dated 31st December 19/2, from His Majesty 1 s Vice-Consul, Ahmiaz, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to submit the following report on the situation as ascer tained by Dr. Young at Malamir. Attack on Lieutenant Bullock. —It appears that Sardar-i-Jang has so far taken no steps to punish the Kuhgilu section responsible for this outrage. Had he intended to do so the proper time for action was in November and the early part of December and the fact that he has delayed action is a clear indication that he either lacks the power or intention to take any steps whatever. Any punitive measures are now impossible until March and I much doubt if anything will be then done. Sardar-i-Jang has arrested and punished certain Bakhtiari tribesmen (occupying villages near the spot where the outrage was committed) for allowing the robbers to reach the road. Extract from a letter No. 10-36, dated 13th January 1913, from His Majesty 3 s Vice- Consul, Ahwaz, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to forward herewith translation of a letter received to-day from Sardar-i-Jang regarding the arrangements contemplated for securing the safety of the Bakhtiari road. I am inclined to the opinion that there is little hope of the road remaining J open during the coming summer. The Amir Mujahid has (as reported in my diaries) succeeded in quelling the disturbance engineered by the Kuhgilu Chiefs but has not been able to assert his influence over these Chiefs nor have they shewn any desire to give him hostages or in any way acknowledge his authority. I am convinced that the Bakhtiari Khans are incapable of subduing the powerful Kuhgilu tribes by force of arms and it is difficult for them, without going to inordinate expense, to safeguard the road from Kuhgilu raiders during the summer months when their tribesmen are in the high country. Translation of a letter dated 22nd Moharrem 1331 [==jst January 1913), from Sardar- i-jang, Malamir, to Captain Grey, Ahwaz. After compliments. It is about 2 weeks that I have arrived at Malamir and I am busy with tribal affairs. With reference to the safety of the Lynch road and subduing the Kuhgilus, I am in communication with Amir Mujahid, Governor of Kuhgilu and Behbehan. As soon as hostages are obtained from the Khawanins and Kalantars (of Kuhgilu) and the latter accept responsibility that hereafter they will not allow any robberies on the caravan road and 1 am satisfied with these arrangements, I will leave for Ab Bid.

With reference to Ispahan News for the week ending 7th December 1912, forwarded under your endorsement No. 5-62, dated the 8th January 1913, I have the honour to inform you that I have no information of an attempt on the part of the Bakhtiaris to punish the Kuhgilus as mentioned by Sardar-i-Zaffar. Had any such attempt been made I would certainly have learnt of it and I am therefore inclined to disbelieve the Sardar-i-Zaffar's statement. As you are aware Sardar-i-Zaffar belongs to the Ilkhani family and it is therefore possible that he made the statement, knowing it to be inaccurate, in order purposely to discredit Sardar-BJang who is a member of the Haji Ilkani family.

Telegram P., No. 5, dated (and received) the 6th January 1913. From—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your telegrams Nos. 6, 8 and 10. I am informed by the Sardar Assad that a report has been received from the AmF Mujahid that the Kuhgelu are submissive to him, a statement in which he is disposed to place some credence, in view of the fact that the Amir Mujahid is related by marriage to many of the most important chiefs and that they are well disposed to him. The Sardar Assad is by no means confident that the Sardar-i-Jang would be victorious over the Kuhgelu, were he to initiate military operations against them, because they are the strongest and most warlike tribe in Persia, but he expressed himself as confident that Sardar-i Jang will be able to keep them off the road and prevent further acts of brigandage. With a view to overawing the Kuhgelu he has a large force with him. So far as concerns the Jarrahi lands, it is impossible to foresee what may happen, unless it can be arranged that they should be sold to the Shaikh. The Khans seem to be determined to take possession of what they have pur chased unless they obtain a good price for the lands. The Sardar Assad has promised to telegraph to the Sardar-i-Jang that on no account should he lend assistance to any designs Amir Mujahid may have on Bandar Dilam or its revenues but it is maintained by him that it is the Governor of Behbehan who must collect the revenues of Lirawi although he undertakes that the present cadastre shall not be altered. The Said-es-Sultaneh who says he has paid taxes here regularly is much exercised respecting his Lirawi lands. I am of opinion that the Bakhtiari have no intention of moving against the Buwair Ahmad. Some days previously I was told by the Sardar Assad that Sardar-i-Jang has not yet been able to discover the identity of Bullock’s assailants : it is suspected by him that they were Bakhtiaris, and he swears that they shall be discovered and suitable punishment meted out to them. I have been enabled, thanks to your representations, to teL the Sardar Assad that l could not place much faith in the Bakhtiari, when they are neither able to keep order at home, or to avenge the con mission on an unoffending traveller of a dastardly assault. .O: Cgft V v //.Telegram P., No. 6, dated (and received) the 6th January IQIS- From—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (repeated to Mohammerah No i). I have the honour to refer to your telegram regarding the Ghazban incident, No. 7 On being pressed in the matter, the Sardar Assad became a little loose in his dates, and in his general assertions, stating that after attacking the Lynch steamers, Ghazban fled, some two years ago, from Turkish territory and since then had wandered about a good deal in Persia. He seemed to think that it was possible that Ghazban had been approached by Jang, some six or eight months ago. but was inclined to believe that it was from the former that the first overtures had come. The story would seem to be an old one dished up again, but it has resulted in the despatch of stringent orders to the Khans to keep the peace. Telegram P., No. i, dated 6th January 1913. From—His Majesty’s Consul, Mohammerah, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. (Repetition of telegram No. 1 to Minister, repeated Ahwaz by post). I have the honour to state, in reply to Your Excellency’s telegram No. 34 that the powers given to Agha Rahim Khan w r ere contained in several letters addressed to the Shaikh of Mohammerah by the Sardar-i-Jang, and to Haji Rais-ut-Tujjar by the Sardar’s Wazir, some in the latter’s own handwriting. One letter, which Agha Rahim presented personally, was entirely in the Sardar-i-Jang’s handwriting, and was to the effect that he had sent his uncle Agha Rahim Khan with reference to all matters, and with a view to preventing friction, and that he trusted that an arrangement might be made with Agha Rahim which would put an end to all bad feeling and replace it by permanent friendship : letter concludes since he is acting as my agent, and whatever is necessary has been told to him by me, I need not enter into details. ” The names of the Sadar and Agha Rahim Khan were several times coupled together, and the latter was referred to in terms of great respect. Murteza Kuli Khan also sent a letter introducing him, The Sardar-i-Jang’s signature and confirmation was of course necessary on these arrangements but, having regard to the circumstances the Shaikh could not but believe that he was negotiating in respect of terms which the Shaikh was prepared to accept, at all events in essentials, and indeed he has fulfilled some of the promised conditions. I fully concur with you in thinking that the meeting to which you refer is now necessary. It has been asked for by the Shaikh and His Majesty’s Vice- Consul, Ahwaz, states that it is expected by the Sardar-i-Jang. All that remains is to see that in the meantime no hostile move is made by the Bakhtiari. 1 his will no doubt be arranged by Your Excellency, Telegram No. 16-57 (Confidential), dated 8th January 1913. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. Shaikh and Bakhtiari relations. Present practical position presents itself to me as follows:— . ^ Firstly ,—Ghazban incident. There seems now little doubt that this intrigue was of Bakhtiari origin. In any case the Shaikh does not seem to regard it seriously.Secondly .—Jarrahi difficulty is a more lively one, of the political aspect of which Mohammerah telegram No. 26, dated July 13th, appears to give a just appreciation. As regards this question, we are on common ground in holding that the purchase of half share from the Mushir-ud-Dauleh was undoubtedly contrived by the Bakhtiari solely for the purpose of annoying and squeezing the Shaikh. That being the case, I think you will be inclined to agree that the telegrams quoted in my telegram No. 12-28 commit us generally and Your Excellency personally to impose a limit on the extortion which the Bakhtiari can be allowed to bring to bear. On this hypothesis I venture respectfully to urge that your assurances to the Shaikh and those of the Sardar-i-Jang and the Sardar Assad to you warrant your adopting an authoritative and decisive line, and insisting on their transferring the lands at a reasonable profit. The assertion now attributed to Jang that he has no intention of transferring the Bakhtiari half share to the Shaikh is a direct contradiction of his assurances to you which the Shaikh was called upon to accept without apprehension in your telegram No. j 58 and which in your telegram 157 Your Excellency undertook to see made good. Moreover purchase of half share does not warrant Bakhtiaris in attempting to enter into possession, seeing that pending transfer their share of customary rents would of course be paid them. They paid 15,000 tomans to Mushir-ud-Dauleh, so that 20,000 tomans representing 33% net profit would seem to be a fair price for Shaikh to pay. I venture to think that your putting your foot down in this direction, coupled with a warning that our immediate interests are too great to enable us to allow a disturbance of the peace, would settle the matter definitely, and would put an end to this recurring bombast providing for the driving of the Shaikh into the sea or the Bakhtiaris into the mountains. Thirdly .—The other questions to be touched on are the rival aspirations in regard to Shushtar, and the amount of Aqili damages to be paid. . i 1 t a As regards the former, I understand that in fulfilment of the terms arranged provisionally between the Shaikh and Agha Rahim, and in anticipation of com pliance by Sadar-i-Jang with reciprocal concessions provided for in same negotia tions, the Shaikh has already retired from his position of equality in Shushtar both in theory and in fact, and accordingly this year the Shushtar Khans have all gone to Malamir, instead of half to the Shaikh and half to Malamir as here- 1 tofore. It would therefore appear that if Your Excellency can dispose of the Jarrahi question in the manner above suggested, only the Aqili compensation will remain for discussion : this also is the assertion of the Sardar-i-Jang. Under this head the Minister of War made a claim for 100,000 tomans while Sardar-i-Zaffar informed Grey that the extent of the damage did not amount to more than 3,000 tomans, which again was the amount to which Agha Rahim provisionally agreed. f do not suggest that 3,000 tomans is necessarily correct, or need be considered final, but I doubt if it would be possible for oar officers to arrive within a reasonable time at a true estimate by local investigation among sufferers, and I would suggest that each Consular officer should obtain independ ent information as to the probable amount of damage done and that the difference should be split and the resulting figure imposed on the parties by Your Excel lency. The fixing of this item alone would hardly provide material for a formal meeting in the presence of our officers and although parties concerned still seem to advocate it, 1 would in view of recent developments and on the supposition that you can give an arbitrary pronouncement in regard to the Jarrahi, deprecate such meeting unless we are in a position and prepared to arbitrate and in the last resort to dictate a settlement of differences and a treaty between the parties by which thev will undertake to keep the peace and refer their disputes to our friendly arbitration, we undertaking to keep the parties up to the terms, (as we are in the habit of doing in the case of the Trucial Chiefs of Oman). As regards the Shaikh, who is accessible and amenable, we should have no difficulty in this respect. In the case of the dissonant Bakhtiari Khans the task4 would not doubt be less simple but they know on which side their bread Is buttered and the fact that we are always in a position to afford practical backing to the Shaikh enables us to dictate to them with almost equal force. I submit that the impotence of the Persian Government in the region in question: our own practical and increasing predominance in the central zone and our paramount interest in Arabistan, fully warrant our taking such action and that unless we do so those interests and our relations with the Shaikh of Mohammerah whose adherence and good will is a vital factor in our Gulf policy will be liable to serious recurring prejudice.

In a case such as the present one, the definition of the term “ market value ” is not a very easy matter.

I have asked His Majesty’s Consul to telegraph meanwhile, how much is paid to the Nizam by the Shaikh for his share, and the relation of rent to capital for purposes of sale. I omitted in my telegram No. 16-57 to repeat the reference to the agree ment between the Shaikh and the Bakhtian of 19081 but it might be useful to quote Article 7 of that instrument in the present discussion, and I venture to invite reference thereto.

With reference to the correspondence ending with my telegram No. 37 dated 22nd December, I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of a letter which I have received from Shaikh Khazal, addressed to you, with reference to the Bakhtiari question. I have not attempted to dissuade the Shaikh from forwarding this letter as it stands, since it seems to me desirable to bring the question to a head. You will have seen my telegram, No. 38, which I have just despatched to the Minister: the Ghazban incident appears to be undoubtedly due to Bakhtiari intrigues, and the Shaikh further states that Sardar-i-Jang has made attempts to intrigue with Hyder Khan and with the brother of Farhan Assad. 1 cu . 1 S 1 ard . a r i 'J?'g 1 f nt hIs ar ? cIe ’ A S ha RahIm » Arshad-ed-Dowleh to the Shmkh with a friendly letter giving him, as agent, full powers to negotiate on his behalf and stating that he had given him full instructions. I have myself seen au et n r ,£ 1Vln , g these P owers and a similar letter from Murteza Kuli Khan. Agha Rahim thus came thoroughly accredited. A reference to my letter, No. 94-C., will show the details of the agreement made between him and the Shaikh which was to be confirmed and signed by bardar-i-Jang and Murteza Kuli Khan, who were to meet the Shaikh at Wais near Ahwaz. Sardar-i-Jang has now written a far from polite letter to the Shaikh repudiat- ing a t e agreements made by his agent, whom he accuses the Shaikh o( having tampered with, and refusing to come to Wais ; while he now demands 3 o ,o° o to 40,000 tomans for the Jarrahi lands, in place of 15,000 agreed upon by Agha Rahim, the latter amount being what the Bakhtiari Khans themselves gave for the property. A reference to No. 303 of the Vice-Consulate, Ahwaz News, No. 34, for the week ending 24th December will show that the Sardar-i-Jang is reported to be co ec ing cwces at Malamir and that this is causing uneasiness in Arabistan. It is natural that the Shaikh, knowing of the Ghazban incident, surprised at the su en c ange of front of the Sardar-i-Jang and hearing of the collection of forces is, with the last year s experience in his mind, inclined to the belief that there may be a sudden movement on Jarrahi. r 4 u e j* 5 made n ,° counter preparations of his own is entirely due to the m . u bfr 1 ,f lpre n S , ed up0n hlm the Master’s views, had told him that the Minister had^ full confidence in Sardar-i-Jang and was giving him his full support, S j 1 n ^ emight rest assured that the Sardar-i-Jang would arrange with him and would hand him over the Jarrahi lands.You are aware that the Shaikh’s government is patriarchal in system; all matter of policy, all undertakings we give are repeated to the chiefs of tribes. The Shaikh now finds himself in a difficult position: he has informed the ‘‘Gillet ” of all that has been conveyed to him by the Minister, by yourself, or by me, and he has now been asked by them why, if the Minister of the great British Government assured him that if he trusted the Bakhtiaris all would be well, the Bakhtian question has this winter again assumed a dangerous appear* ance. To their untutored minds it appears impossible that the Bakhtiaris would dare to do what they knew would displease the British Government. You are further aware that the Bakhtiaris spread reports that they are supported against the Shaikh by the British Government authorities ; the Shaikh has it from a source, which he trusts, that the Sardar-i-Jang has in open Majlis at Malamir stated that he is prepared to fight the Shaikh for the Jarrahi lands and that he has the support of the British Government in so doing; such reports are not without their effect on the ignorant minds of the tribesmen who begin to suspect political motives and to wonder whether we are playing off the Shaikh and the Bakhtiaris against each other for our own ends. You know that ever since l have been here my great and chief object has been to gain the complete confidence of the Shaikh. This confidence he has given but not withstanding that fact and the fact that l have openly told him that we desire to keep friends with the Bakhtiari, as well as with him, it is evident that a doubt, half suppressed, has recently entered his mind. 1 have thus considered it wiser to allow him to address you in any terms that he may desire. Our position with the Shaikh has given us great advantages and assures us, practically of the control of Arabistan, or, at least a predominant position of great value in its commercial and political developments. We have on various occa sions made use of our position with him to instruct him on points of conduct and on one occasion told him not to interfere in Bakhtiari quarrels. His request then would appear to be a reasonable one: it does not appear very much for him to ask that a warning be given to the Bakhtiaris that any attack on him would be a matter of great concern to us. This is especially the case when we remember that we told him that if he would adopt a less suspicious attitude towards the Bakhtiaris, matters would be easily settled ; it is impossible, on the one hand, to curb his activities while leaving the Bakhtiaris free agents, and on the other hand to leave him exposed to possible attack. The Shaikh points out that he and his tribes cannot, year by year, go to the expense of collecting men to meet the Bakhtiari who advance upon him with Persian Government money, Persian Government arms, Persian Government guns and not least Persian Government artillerymen: his tribesmen, confident in their numbers, tell him that it would be better to end or mend the matter once and for all. Agha Rahim is coming to Nasiri to see the Shaikh about what has happened but negotiations with the Sardar-i-Jang have ceased and the matter rests in this unsatisfactory position. It has been suggested that it is no business of ours to prevent the Bakh tiaris driving a hard bargain with the Shaikh. There might be some truth in this were the sum asked not obviously and purposely prohibitive ; as matters stand it would be bad policy on our part to take no action, since it would appear that our previous interposition in the matter had been for the benefit of the Bakhtiari. We shall need to deal very largely with the Shaikh ourselves in the near future in matters of land and money. We should not forget at this juncture the very valuable assistance he has given in obtaining all the lands we require for railways in the South-West of Persia, in the option he has readily given us oyer Khor Musa, in the willingness with which he has fallen in with our frontier policy or even the land he has given us for a new Consulate. The spirit behind these undertakings has needed careful nurturing and should not readily be upset. On the other band the Bakhtiari will think none the less of us if we inform them in all friendliness that we are willing that our officers should assist them in arriving at an understanding4 but that our interests in these parts are too great to permit of our allowing Arabistan to become a scene of turmoil and strife. The fundamental fact to be remembered is that the Shaikh is quite correct in stating that he could not allow the Jarrahi lands, a stronghold of the Chaab, to oass into the occupation of the Bakhtiari. Were he to permit of such a thing it would weaken his control over the Arab tribes in general to a degree which he could not afford to face and which we should find very detrimental to our interests In these circumstances 1 trust that you will be able to give your support to the recommendations which 1 have made to the Minister in my recent telegrams in accordance with what I have stated above. Translation of a letter from the Shaikh of Mohantmerah to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf dated 2 5 th December 1912 {15th Muharram 1329). After compliments. —I have now thought it necessary to trouble you on the subject of the Bakhtiaris. In consequence of the proceedings which they suddenly took towards me, as frequently stated to Major Haworth, I intended to take measures this year to make preparations in my territories beforehand. Several telegrams from His Excellency the British Minister were shown me bv the Consul in which the former has given me assurances on behalf of the Bakhtiaris and of the Sardar*i-Jang that they had no object in view except friendly intentions towards me and that they will not molest my territories, and that as regards the Jarrahi lands also I should rest assured. For these reasons I abandoned the intentions I had in view for protecting my territories and driving them into the mountains until the Sardar-i-Jang arrived at winter quarters and addressed me a friendly letter containing cordial expressions, stating that he had sent his representative, Arshad-ud-Dauleh, Agha Rahim Khan, on certain matters which the latter would discuss verbally, so that these trivial matters outstanding between us should be removed and there should be no obstacle to the strengthen ing of friendship and unity. His Majesty’s Consul has duly seen the letter from the Sardar-i-Jang and from Murtaza Quli Khan, the son of Samsam-es-Sultanah, the Premier. Arshad-ud-Douleh came here on the 1st Zilqadeh : he stated the objects of the Sardar-i-Jang and accepted my proposals on the latter’s behalf. I wrote to the Sardar-i-Jang accordingly, and the Arshad-ud-Dauleh also wrote the details of the arrangements between us. When the Arshad-ud-Dauleh returned to Shushter afterwards I carried out the proposals. As l informed the Consul of the arrangements come to between us when Arshad-ud-D^uleh was here, and as he has of course represented them to you, I need not recapitulate them here. A reply was however received from Sardar-i-Jang last week in contravention of the arrangements made by the Arshad-ud-D^uleh, while on the other hand rumours aj were being received from Dizful during the last two or three weeks that Sardar-i- Jang is sending men to Shaikh Ghazban, to the Bani Lam, to the Sagwand, to Haidar Khan, etc., giving them promises and threats against me. I I did not believe this at first, until this week, when the Consul showed me a telegram from His Excellency the British Minister stating that the Bakhtiari Khans say that Ghazban, Shaikh of the Bani Turuf, has an alliance with them. I still did not believe it, because Shaikh Ghazban is a Shaikh of the Bani Turuf, and a Turkish subject in the territory of Amarah. Now the Mutassarif of Amarah has reported to the acting Wali of Basrah two or three days ago to the effect that Ghazban had sent to him stating that Sardar-i-Jang had addressed a letter and sent a man to him giving him many promises and inviting him to join him in an attack on my territories and tribes, and also that he has sent Arabs to my tribes which are in the neighbourhood of Dizful and Shushter.5 Under these circumstances it appears that Sardar-i-Jang intends to pick a quarrel with me, and I have therefore thought it necessary to acquaint you with the Sardar-i-]ang’s proceedings. Translation of a letter dated December 25th, 1912, from the Shaikh of Moham- merah to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In the enclosed letter I have represented certain details regarding the news which has reached me regarding the Sardar-i-Jang, Bakhtiari. Apart from the assurance which used to be given by His Majesty’s Minister, you have assured me on behalf of His Majesty’s Government that_ the latter would never allow, whether the Persian Government was constitutional or despotic, that my property, tribes’ credit and jurisdiction, as well as the specified revenue paid by me, should be diminished or enhanced, and that the above should remain in their present state, and you are of course aware that in former times, when the reins of the Persian Government’s affairs were not in the hands of the Bakhtiaris, they never used to raise any quarrels with me, now however that the reins of Government have fallen into their hands, and especially during the last two years, the sons of the late Haji llkhani, namely the Sardar Muhtasham and the Sardar Ashja’a, since the former has obtained the ministry for war, have begun to oppose me. The Sardar Ashja’a’s proceedings last year were taken under the instructions of his brother, the Sardar-i-Muhtasham, and this year also his brother the Sardar-i-Jang has begun to oppose me, and threatens me with the aid of the Government guns and gunners, and wishes to interfere and meddle with my properties and territories. It is obvious that my tribesmen and tribes will take action to defend themselves against them, and this will involve losses and paralyse commercial affairs, both of Persians and foreigners. The fact is that this is the source of extraordinary trouble and loss to me, and to my tribesmen, who have to bear these difficulties and expenses every year for three months. This being the case it is the duty and obligation of His Majesty’s Government to prevent the Bakhtiaris. I shall be leaving for Nasiri to-day, and will await a written answer there.

I am informed by the Shaikh of Mohammerah that he has just been told by the Wall of Basrah that the mutassanfof Arnarah has received a report from Shaikh Ghazban of the Bam Lam to the effect that a man has been sent to him by the Sardar-i-Jang with promises, and urging him to attack Shaikh Khazal. Ghazban, who has only just once more got on good terms again with the Ottoman authorities, asked for a hint as to what reply he should give, and was told that on no account should he have anything to do with the matter. I am referred to the Wall of Basrah by the Shaikh for corroboration of the above. Repeated to Ahwaz by post. Letter No. 310, dated the 31st December 1912. Prom—L ieutenant-Colonel S,r P. Z.

I am anxious to catch the mail so cannot reply at length, but just write to acknowledge receipt of your two letters dated 15th Moharrum.6 I think it is not hidden from you, but I can assure you one thing that both Major Haworth at Mohammerah and I here habitually do our utmost both by telegraph and by letter to explain fully your point of view to higher authority and to support your just interests and rights and we are doing so now. I am, however, making fresh representations by telegraph in connection with what you write in the letters now under reply. I need not trouble you further to-day. Please give my best compliments to Shaikh Chasib and Haji Rais and accept my best wishes for the new year. Telegram P., No. 3if, dated the 30th (received 31st) December 1912. From—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. (Repetition of telegram to Mohammerah with reference his telegram, No. 38, and repeated Ahwaz No. 19.) It seems clear that there was some foundation for the rumours which reached me regarding intrigues between Shaikh Ghazban and the Bakhtiari. It is to be regretted that the story should have come to the knowledge of the Shaikh of Mohammerah, as it will naturally cause him to regard the Bakhtiari with even more suspicion than before. The Bakhtiari story is that when Ghazban was a fugitive from the Turks with the Bani Turuf, he intrigued to get that tribe and half of three other tribes to make a combination against the Shaikh, and sought also the co-operation of the Bakhtiari. After some hesitation this was refused under orders from Tehran. Ghazban would of course tell the story to suit his own book as soon as he had become on good terms with the Turks. Telegram P., No. 1497, dated the 29th December 1912. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah. I should be much obliged if you could be so good as to ascertain from the local authorities at Basrah, and inform me by wire of the present whereabouts of Shaikh Ghazban of the Bani Dam and the state of his relations with the Turkish authorities at present. Telegram P., No. , dated (and received) the 1st January 1913. From—His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Please see your telegram of December 29th regarding Ghazban. The reply of the acting Wali of Basrah is to the effect that it is not known exactly where Ghazban is, but thac he is near Amarah. He has been pardoned, and is now ] obedient, and as yet has not given trouble. Certain Persians invited him to I accompany them to Southern Persia, but he refused saying that as he obeyed the orders of the Turkish Government he could not move. It is proposed to let him farm Government lands. I hear from private sources that he is now at Tib some three hours from Amarah and that influential Arabs are trying to induce the Turkish Government to lease him lands. No decision has however yet been taken on this subject which is now being discussed in the Administrative Council. Telegram P., No. 6-14, dated the 4th January 1913. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—-His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. Please see my telegram No. 300, December 26th and my telegram No. 3.(0 It is reported by Grey under date December 17th, that the presence of the Sardar-i-Jang at Malamir with a considerable force and with Government guns which he brought from Ispahan is causing some uneasiness in Arabistan. (2) An attempt on the part of the Sardar-i-Jang to take possession of the Jarrahi lands is foreshadowed by your telegram No. 295. (3) Please see my telegram No. 281, dated November 30th, 1912. It is now reported by the Khan of Hayat Daud that the Amir Mujahid, incensed at the opposition offered to his ambitions by the Customs, the Governor of the Gulf Ports, and the British Legation, has sent for the Sardar-i-Jang to come to his assistance in asserting himself over the districts in question. The above circumstances ail tend to corroborate the apprehension expressed 1 in my telegram No. 301, December 26th, that the proclaimed intention of the Bakhtiaris to punish the Buwair Ahmadis would be used by the former as a means for collecting a force under the name of Government which would be employed merely for the other blackmailing schemes such as those to which reference is made above.

It would be of use to know to what month or precise juncture the Sardar Assad refers when he speaks of Shaikh Ghazban as staying as a fugitive with the Bani Turuf, and entering into intrigues against the Shaikh. I was with the Bani Turuf in April and Wilson in July and neither of us heard anything of his presence in those parts. The statement that Ghazban received but rejected an invitation is corrobo rated by His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, on the authority of the Wall of Basrah.

Shaikh and Bakhtiari Shaikh of Mohammerah has addressed a long letter to me which reached me by last mail After registering a protest against the disingenuous tactics employed by the Khans, more particularly in the matter of the Ghazban intrigue, and the attitude now taken up towards him by the Sardar-i-Jang, he goes on to appeal, in the first place to your personal assuranceswhich were communicated to him in pursuance of your telegrams Nos. 157, 158* and 216 to Bushire and secondly to the cove/of^Residency^eUers^^os.^sfa*'smd 2404 , guarantees of His Majesty’s Government d*ted nth August and 29th September 1912, res- promising him ‘ the support necessary for pectiveiy. obtaining a satisfactory solution in the event of any encroachment on his jurisdiction and recognized rights and on his property in Persia.” In this connection he observes that the amenities of the Bakhtiari Khans gave him no serious inconvenience before they became synonymous with the Persian Government, but that since their migration to Tehran, and their conse quent ability to pursue their own ends in the name of the Persian Government and with the assistance of Government guns and money, the matter has assumed a different complexion. He complains that in spite of our assurances it is now becoming an annual occurrence for him and his tribesmen to have to take ex pensive measures to protect their interests. He concludes by remarking that owing to the present attitude of the Sardar-i-Jang {vide Captain Grey’s reports), he is obliged to repair to Nasiri to assemble his headmen and to make ready for eventualities. Before commenting on the immediate outlook I await a letter which I expect from Grey. C78FD-— 44—23-1-13—GCBP Simla.— — No. 3375 » dated Bushire, the 15th (received 23rd) December 1912.

Both in 1910, when the relations between the Shaikh and the Turks vere strained, and this year, when there was talk of hostilities between the Shaikh and the Bakhtiaris, active support was offered to the Shaikh by Ghazban. the allegations against the Shaikh of oppressing the Arabs need not, I think, be taken very seriously. As Your Excellency is aware, during the last few months British Officers nave been travelling in the neighbourhood of the Turko Persian frontier, and the3 contentment and general prosperity of the tribes was very noticeable, though of course malcontents ready to fish in troubled waters are always to be found.

I am informed by the Bakhtiari Khans that it is anticipated by the Sardar-i-Jang that some trouble may arise with the Shaikh of Mohammerah when he (Sardar-i-Jang?) takes possession of the Jarrahi lands, and he fears that the question may lead to a fight. From Mohammerah telegram, No. 35, I gathered that the settlement of this question was included in the arrangement made in the name of the Khans with the Shaikh, by means of some exchange with lands near Behbehan at Zaidan. The Khans have been accused by me of having bought the lands in question with the object of annoying the Shaikh. They deny this however, and assert that any arrangement which may have been made must have been carried out through the Amir Mujahid, who is distrusted by them all, and they state that no such arrangement has been recognised by them. They declare their readiness to accept any compromise or arrangement that the Sardar-i-Jang may make, as the latter has their confidence. The Khans request that the Shaikh may be warned against allowing himself to be led astray by the Amir Mujahid, and declare that they are most anxious to avoid a rupture.

The chief of that » name belongs to the Beni Lam, a Turkish tribe, and his connection with the matter is very unlikely. The tribe named Beni Turuf are subjects of the Shaikh and there may have been some traffic attempted with the Bakhtiaris by unimportant malcontents, but such would in any case be not worthy of attention. Considering the preciseness of their statement the incorrectness of detail of the Bakhtiari is curious. The information supplied by Lynch is probably the result of what was formerly anticipated by general rumour.

Please refer to Your Excellency’s No. 33 ; at the time of my telegram No. 35 there was no mention of the lands at Zaidan please see my despatch No. 1, dated October 19th last. Arrangements made by Agha Rahim, the uncle and accredited agent of Sardar*i-Jang, are now being repudiated by latter though Agha Rahirn had full powers (1 read his letter of introduction myself) to conduct negotiations on behalf of Sardar-i-Jang. The latter now demands double to treble the price which was paid for the Jarrahi lands by the Bakhtiari which bears the impress of a trick by which the Shaikh may be embroiled. Our advice to the Shaikh, as contained in Your Excellency’s telegram, No. 24 to me, and your telegrams Nos. 157 and 158 to Resident, has been follow ed by him, and it is on our express recommendations that he has trusted the Sardar-i-Jang who, 1 am afraid, is not playing a straight game. Your Excellency will, I venture to trust, be able to inform the Bakhtiari that no advance must be made on the Jarrahi lands, and that they must fulfil the pro mise they made to you, otherwise there is no doubt that there will be very great trouble ; while further, the Shaikh, who recently has done so much for the furtherment of British interests, will find it difficult to maintain his faith in our power if he does not suspect our good intentions. The Amir Mujahid does not have any bearing on the case, for it was on the negotiations with Agha Rahim on behalf of Sardar-i-Jang that the Shaikh was depending. It has openly been stated by the Bakhtiaris to the Vice-Consul, Ahwaz, that the curbing of the power of the Shaikh is their intention. Repeated to Bushire by post.

For the present I am disinclined to regard the position with active disquietude, and will at all events await a reply from Vice-Consul, Ahwaz, before offering specific comment.In any case, however, it is to be feared that the Shaikh-Bakhtiari situation generally is reverting to what it was when I wrote my telegram No. 183, dated * Forwarded to Foreign under Residency letter 3 ®^- and indeed I have found it No. 1812, nth August 1912. difficult not to have a suspicion that the t Enclosure r to Resident's letter No. 3375, 15th communication made to you by the Bakh- x Enclosures 2 herewith. tian Nhans (vide your telegrams Nos. 283,+ dated December 9th and No. 295}:, dated December 15th) have been part of a design to upset current negotiations between the Shaikh and their accredited plenipotentiary, Sardar-i-Jang. or his agent. I beg to submit, with great respect, that the best chance of a successful issue would seem to lie in the Khans at Tehran being encouraged to leave to their local plenipotentiary referred to above, the conduct of the negotiations, and to refrain from splashing in at Tehran. Private. The fact that they do so through Your Excellency makes it by no means easy to prevent the Shaikh of Mohammerah from becoming obsessed with the idea (which is locally encouraged as far as possible by Bakhtiari agents) that in their particular dealings with him, the Khans have the support of His Majesty’s representatives. Being, as he is, under a definite obligation to be guided generally by our wishes and advice, an obligation which he cannot, as a single responsible entity, easily evade, and which he observes loyally on the whole, the Shaikh starts in any case with a specific handicap when dealing with a hydra-headed monster like [the Bakhtiari; I think we need to take this into account. Telegram P., No. 37, dated (and received) 27th December 1912. From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—His Majesty’s Consul, Mohammerah. With reference to your telegram No. 37, I have the honour to enquire what were the nature of those full powers that were given to Agha Rahim. It is main tained by the Sardar Assad that it is not possible that a man of so little impor tance should have been deputed as a duly accredited emissary by the Sardar-i- Jang. He says that the Khans are quite ready to abide by any arrangement that may be arrived at by Sardar-i-Jang, and expresses the hope that the latter may receive the assistance and advice of His Majesty’s Consuls. It is ridiculous, he says, to suppose that the Bakhtiaris will sell the Jarrahi lands for what they gave for them, as they bought them cheap to sell to the Shaikh dear. He says that Agha Rahim must have been bribed. It should be remembered that when I telegraphed regarding the mission of the Sardar-i-Jang, I never anticipated a direct arrangement through an emissary, but a general settlement of all outstanding questions under the auspices of yourself and Captain Grey. I was much surprised at hearing of the arrangement made with Agha Rahim more especially as the Khans here disclaimed all know ledge of the negotiations. From your telegram No. 35 moreover, it would seem that the agreement was subject to the ratification of the Sardar-i-Jang and other leading Khans, who have probably since it was concluded ascertained that its terms are unacceptable here. The Khans adopt a bellicose manner in speaking, but they are probably bluffing, and they have undertaken to send strict instructions to Sardar-i-Jang to avoid a breach of the peace at all hazards, but they are much incensed at what they call the overbearing attitude of the Shaikh, and they assert that they would have driven him into the sea long ago, had it not been for the support afforded to him by His Majesty’s Government.

From—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Please see your telegram No. 300. The story about Shaikh Ghazban is still adhered to by the Sardar Assad, who says that the former is a fugitive from Turkish territory and a guest of the Bani Turuf tribe, which he persuaded to conspire against the Shaikh with the Bakhtiari. The appreciation of the situation contained in your telegram No. 183 shows that you know the Bakhtiaris better than I then did. I fear that they are quite j untrustworthy and that they evade their engagements by playing off one branch of their family against another. At the present moment they are talking in a most bellicose strain, but it is mostly bluster. Their object is to squeeze the Shaikh into giving a good price for the Jarrahi lands.

(December 9 , 7 p.m.) IT having been brought to my knowledge that it was believed that local Bakhtiari khans were meditating co-operation with 'aSair~of Ghazban, Sheikh of the Beniturruf tribe, with a view to making joint attack on the Sheikh of Mohammerah, I made representations to the khans here to-day expressing the sincere hope that there was no foundation for the rumour, and demanding that any such idea, if it existed, should be at once abandoned. I am assured that khans have been instructed they must not entertain such an idea, but it is owned that question had been mooted by the Arab tribe in question, who had urged Bakhtiari to join them and make an end once for all of the sheikh. Sardar Assad took the opportunity of expressing hope that sheikh might receive a hint from the British consular authorities to abstain from oppressing the Arabs, as his conduct was causing much discontent.

IN contimiation of my despatch No. 202 of the 1st ultimo, reporting an improvement in the relations between Sheikh of Mohammerah and the Bakhtiaris, I have the honour to forward to you herewith copy of a despatch which I have received from His Majesty’s consul at Mohammerah, reporting the conclusion of a satisfactory agreement between the two parties. Though the Bakhtiari khans resident in Tehran are not in possession of the terms of the agreement made, they have declared themselves ready to abide by any settlement reached by Sardar-i-Jang. I have, &amp;c., WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. 1. Consul Haworth to Sir W. Townley. (No. 1. Confidential.) Sir, Mohammerah, October 19, 1912. I HAVE the honour to inform you that Agha Rahim arrived here on the 14th instant to discuss Bakhtiari differences with the sheikh. The result of this meeting has been as follows :— The Jarrahi lands recently bought by the Bakhtiaris are to be resold to the sheikh for the price paid for them, i.e., 15,000 tomans. With reference to the Akili lands, should the Bakhtiaris be able to show that any of their property rests with the Arabs, such property will be returned. To this point I will return. ... . Further, all the agreements recently made with the Amir Mujahid and signed by him will be ratified by the khans and will be signed by all. The sheikh agrees to give up all claims with regard to Shuster on the following conditions.' The Governor appointed shall always be a neutral one from Tehran, and Agha Rahim is now to be his assistant and represent both sheikh and Bakhtiari, but neither the governor nor Rahim Khan shall at any time have the right to send a mamur to any Arabs residing within the country from Dizful and Husseinabad in^ the north to the southernmost point of the Arabistan jurisdiction, nor shall they send mamurs to Bilaiti (across the river at Shuster), nor to the Gundezlu, nor to the Kharran lands : should any Arabs, or anyone in the places named, offend, the sheikh will be referred to, and he promises to take the necessary steps to punish them. The Bakhtiaris further ask that Bakir Khan be released with the condition that he shall not return to Shuster. They also ask that the family of the kalantar be allowed to return to the town. This the sheikh has agreed to, and in return the Bakhtiaris have agreed that no harm shall be done to those who were supporters of the sheikh, on account of anything done against the Bakhtiaris in the past; but this agreement does not affect anything they may do to offend in the future. . . . . After the arrival of Sardar Jang at Abbid, he and Murteza Kuh Khan with Amir Mujahid will meet the sheikh at Wais, one stage from Ahwaz, and all points will be discussed and matters settled and the agreement signed. . I have referred to the question of the Akili lands. After the above-mentioned meeting the sheikh has agreed that on account of certain tents and othm stoied goods which were lost in the Akili affair, he will make “ a present]’ of 3,000 tomans to the khans concerned. He refused to listen to any question of indemnity, and the matter2 These arrangements are in every way satisfactory, and should provide a means to terminate the friction which has so long existed between the two tribes.

In addition to the good offices of His Majesty’s Minister with the Sardar Assad in promoting the settlement, the Shaikh’s interests seem/ to have greatly benefited by the staunch attitude in regard to him of the Amir Mujahid and the fact that the leading Khans in Tehran could not afford to risk the active opposition of the Amir and the petty Khans who look to him.

I attach much importance to this arrangement from which I anticipate happiest results. Pray tell him so.

His Majesty’s Vice-Consulate, Ahwaz ; Camp Chighakhur, 23rd September 1912. Sir, f n I / In amplification of my marginally noted telegrams I have the honour to sub mit the following report on my journey to Chighakhur with Sardar-i-Jang and the steps taken by that Chief to re-establish order in Bakhtiari country and to assure the safety of the Lynch Road. No. 21—&lt; 56 , dated Deh Kurd, the 30th August 1912. No. 22—68, dated Chighakhur, the loth Septem ber 1912. No.25—75, dated Chighakhur, the i8th Septem ber 1912. No. 28—77, dated Chighakhur, the 18th Septem ber 1912. As already reported, the Sardar-i-Jang with Murteza Kulli Khan left Ispahan for Chighakhur—the summer administrative headquarters—on the 24th August.2 The same day Sardar-i-Fateh and Sardar Mu’azam were despatched to Chahar Mahal bearing letters from me and Sardar-i-Jang to Amir Mujahid. In my letter I gave the message authorised in Your Excellency’s letter of the 13th July and explained that I had been specially deputed to accompany the Sardar and to (Q assist him in his mission, that the Sardar’s appointment to the Bakhtiari Ilkhani- ship had our support and that any action on his part or on the part of the junior Khans which would hamper him in the execution of his duty would incur the severe displeasure of His Majesty’s Government. It was arranged that we should march slowly to Saman where Sardar-i- Fateh would bring the replies from Amir Mujahid and where Sardar-i'Jang had ordered some 200 Bakhtiari sowars to concentrate. On the 24th August Najafabad was reached and a halt made the following day. On the 26th we reached Azizabad and there received news that Amir Mujahid with several of the younger Khans and a following of some 1,500 Bakhtiaris had moved from his home (Shamsabad) to Deh Kurd north of which village he proposed to forcibly resist our advance. On the 27th we marched to Saman where the 200 sowars, mentioned above, joined our camp bringing the number of the Sardar’s following to some 500 horse and foot. The same day Sardar-i-Fateh returned to camp with messages from Amir Mujahid to the effect that he and the junior Khans had no intention of resisting the Sardar by force and that, provided the latter was willing to support them in their just demands with the other senior Khans, they were prepared to aid him by every means in their power. On the 28th we moved to Deh Kurd where several interviews took place with the Amir Mujahid and the younger Khans. The Sardar-i-Jang promised to support the Amir in his desire to obtain a Governorship but we decided that we would try and induce him to accept the Behtjhblan Governorship for which he was peculiarly fitted owing to his relationship with the Bahmai Kuhgelus and his intimate knowledge of Kuhgelu politics. The Sardar promised also to use his influence in favour of the junior Khans and in return obtained their undertaking to support him. On the 30th August the camp was broken up, all the Khans proceeding to their homes, while tents, provisions, etc., were collected at Chighakhur. On the 4th September we all concentrated again at Chighakhur and here we were successful in persuading Amir Mujahid to accept the Behbehan Gover norship. It was arranged that he should go to his home to make the necessary preparations for his journey, return to Chighakhur about the end of September and then leave direct for his new capital. Sardar-i-Jang at the time when we had considered it advisable to get the Amir put of Bakhtiari territory as soon as possible and before we had succeeded in3 the Haji Ilkhani family. Ample funds have been placed at the disposal of this young Chief. In addition to the command of the road guards he has been given certain powers over the Dinaruni (Aurak) section which occupies the territory adjoining the road and 300 men from this section have been ordered to remain in the vicinity of the road itself and made responsible for the safety of traffic. i Bahadur-us*Sultaneh with his guards left Chighakhur for the road on 16th September. On the 18th September the Ilkhani announced to me officially the opening of the road and I notified Ispahan and Ahwaz. It is hoped that it will be possible to considerably reduce the number of the / road guards once the Amir Mujahid has assumed control at Behbehan and has got the Kuhgelu well in hand. Sufficient men to garrison the six newly construct ed towers with a few men at each of the six or seven more remote halting places would probably then be sufficient to prevent any Bakhtiari interference with traffic. The Sardar-i-Jang has promised that the question of providing and improv ing accommodation at the various stages, making arrangements for fodder and effecting necessary repairs to the track itself will receive his attention as money becomes available from bridge tolls, tribal revenue, etc. The arrangements made, in my opinion, promise well and Sardar-i-J^fng is { to be congratulated on the great deal he has accomplished in so short a time. Murteza Kulli Khan, once having decided to accept the Ilbegiship, has rendered the Sardar his loyal support and assistance which was particularly valuable when the resistance of the young Khans had to be overcome. The tribal administration of the Sardar is capable and disinterested and he is rapidly gaining the confidence and affection of the tribesmen. In view of the excellent work so far done by the Sardar and his undoubtedly sincere desire to see order restored and kept in Bakhtiari territory I venture to point out to Your Excellency the importance of rendering him our utmost support and of ensuring that the ample powers he now enjoys under his ‘ Sanad ’ are not modified during the full term of his appointment.

These good relations continued for a considerable time, surviving the overthrow of Mohammed Ali and lasting during the sessions of the Medjliss. Since the suspension of that body and the removal of all check upon the activities of Russian agents in Persia, the situation as between Arabs and Bakhtiari has become steadily worse. The good offices of the Sardar Assad would seem to be unavailing by themselves. On a recent occasion when a Bakhtiari force marched to Shuster, it was found possible to compose the quarrel. This will be more difficult under the altered circumstances. I need not remind you of the serious consequences to British trade which would be sure to follow from a renewal of hostilities. I am, therefore, desired by my board to request that the situation may receive the serious consideration of His Majesty’s Government, and that energetic representations may be made both to Sheikh Khuzzel and to the Bakhtiari chiefs with a view to the establishment of a permanent peace between Arabs and Bakhtian.

I thought it would produce good effect if I went out to first stage and am therfore now camped at Varghun. This afternoon Jang came out to my camp full of apologies for the inconvenience I had suffered and begged me to return. He said that Murteza had definite y refused to come and that without a partner from the rival family he could accom- nlish nothing. He said he would start at once if any Ilkham chief was sent as his nartner or even if he were authoritatively informed that one had been appointed and would join him later in Bakhtiari country. He said Miirteza’s heart was not in the work and he would not now wish him to come even if he could be forced to eo. He suggested Zia-us-Sultan, Amir Mujahid or Sardar Bahadur who is in Europe. I am inclined to agree with Jang regarding hopelessness of Murteza and consider Amir Mujahid out of the question owing to his bitter hostility to Haji Ilkhani family. I will remain here a day or two longer and then if nothing is settled return to Ispahan.

We arrived here yesterday,^ Amir Mujahid having abandoned all idea of forcible resistance. Several interviews have taken place between young Khan party, the Sardar-i-Jang and myself. 1 am of opinion that Amir Mujahid’s presence in Bakhtiari country is most undesirable as he would be constant source of trouble to Jang and rallying point for all who arte discontented with Jang’s rule. Would it be possible for him to be given Governor ship of Yezd which he is desirous of getting? I understand he has already approached the Khans in Tehran on the subject and they are prepared to arrange the matter provided Amir Mujahid first proceeds to Tehran. Amir Mujahid wishes to avoid this as he fears that after the expense and trouble of the journey the Khans may find some excuse for not giving him the Governor ship, having accomplished their object of getting him out of Bakhtiari territory. Telegram (P.) No. 22-68, dated the 10th September 1912. From—His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Ahwaz, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, Chighakhur, September 10th. Amir Mujahid, with whom friendly relations have been established, has been persuaded to accept Behbehan Governorship. He is related to Kuhgelus and is most likely person to succeed in establishing order among them. He leaves about end of September. Young Khans’ differences have been disposed of and I think no more trouble is to be expected from them. Two hundred Bakhtiari road guards from well armed sections are being despatched for road under Bahadur-us-Sultaneh. These will remain until Amir Mujahid has assumed control of Kuhgelu when number will be reduced to sufficient to garrison guard towers. Arrangements promise well and I hope to be able to recommend resumption of traffic before end of September. Telegram (P.) No. 79, dated the 13th September 1912.

As already reported the Sardar-i-Jang with Murteza Kulh Khan left Ispahan for Chighakhur, the summer administrative head-quarters, on the 24th August Ihe same day Sardar-i-Fatheh and Sardar Mu’azam were dispatched to Chahar Mahal beaung letters from me and Sardar-i-Jang to Amir Mujahid. In my letter I gave the message authorised in your Excellency’s letter of the 13th July, and exp amec la ^ [T 1 specially deputed to accompany the Sardar and to assist him m his mission that the Sardar s appointment to the Bakhtiari Ilkhaniship had oui suppor , an ra an} action on his part or on the part of the junior khans which would hamper him m the execution of his duty would incur the seveie displeasuie o is aj y G 0 Ve it n wa n 8 t 'arranged that we should march slowly to Saman where Sardar-i-Fatheh would bring the replies from Amir Mujahid, and where Sardar-i-Jang had ordeied some 200 Bakhtiari sowars to concentrate. n j On the 24th August Najafabad was reached, and a halt made the following day On the 2 bth we reached Azizabad, and there received news that Amir Mujahid w i n several of the younger khans and a following of some 1,500 Bakhtians had moved fron his home (Shamsabad) to Deh Kurd north of which village he proposed to foicibly res om a ^ a ^‘ 27th we marched t0 Saman where the 200 sowars, mentioned above, joined our camp, bringing the number ol the Sardar s following to some 0 ^ • i • i The same day Sardar-i-Fatheh returned to camp with messages from Amir Mujah i to the effect that he and the junior khans had no intention of resisting Sardar by force, and that, provided the latter was willing to support them “ tl “y J _ demands with the other senior khans, they were prepared to aid him by ever) mea iU ^On thlmh we moved to Deh Kurd where several interviews took place with the Amir Mujahid and the younger khans. Ihe Sardar-i-Jang promise ' , ! ti v and Amir in his desire to obtain a governorship, butj^g decided that we would t y U ' [2700 3 — 6 ] 16N0V1912&gt;J yvGxTcV 1 '2 induce him to accept the Behbehan governorship for which he was peculiarly fitted owimr to his relationship with the Bahmai Kubgelus, and his intimate knowledge of Kuhgelu politics. The teardar promised also to use his influence in favour of the junior khans and in return obtained their undertaking to support him. On the 30th August The camp was broken up, all the khans proceeding to their^ homes, while tents, provisions, &amp;c., were collected at Chighakhur. ^ On the 4 th September we all concentrated again at Chighakhur, and here we were successful in persuading Amir Mujahid to accept 'the Behbehan governorship. It was arranged that he should go to his home to make the necessary preparations tor his journey, return to Chighakhur about the end of September, and then leave direct for his new capital. _ _ On the 15th September the khans in Tehran notified both the Sardar-i-Jang and Amir Mujahid that the latter had been appointed to the governorship of Yezd. They had arranged this appointment on the recommendation of Sardar-i-Jang at the time when we had considered it advisable to get the Amir out of Bakhtiari territory as soon as possible, and before we had succeeded in inducing him to accept the Behbehan governorship. On the receipt of the news the Amir was immediately summoned to Chighakhur where it was explained to him that his appointment to Yezd was made •under a misapprehension, and that he must proceed, as arranged, to Behbehan. It r was agreed that he should send Muntazzim-ed-Dowleh to represent him in Yezd, and meanwhile go to Behbehan, take the necessary hostages from the Kuhgelu tribes to guarantee their good behaviour', and then, if all promised well, be relieved by one of the junior khans, and proceed to Yezd. The Amir agreed to these arrangements. The arrangements made to ensure the safety of the Lynch road were as follows : 200 men have been selected from the Zarraswand and Usiwand sections as road guards. These sections are the best armed of all the Bakhtiaris, 80 per cent, of them possessing magazine rifles. These guards have been paid a cash advance of 120 krans each, the money being paid to them before me, and they have been promised regular pay at the rate of 120 krans per month as long as their services may be required. The command of these guards has been given to Bahadur-es-Sultaneh, the son of Hujabr-es-Sultan, the senior khan of the Haji Ilkhani family. Ample funds have been placed at the disposal of this young chief. In addition to the command of the road guards he has been given certain powers over the Dinaruni (Aurak) section, which occupies the territory adjoining the road, and 300 men from this section have been ordered to remain in the vicinity of the road itself, and made responsible for the safety of traffic. Bahadur-es-Sultaneh with his guards left Chighakhur for the road on the 16th September. On the 18th September the Ilkhani announced to me officially the opening of the road, and I notified Ispahan and Ahwaz, It is hoped that it will be possible to considerably reduce the number of the road guards once the Amir Mujahid has assumed control at Behbehan, and has got the Kuhgelu well in band. Sufficient men to garrison the six newly constructed towers with a few men at each of the six or seven more remote halting places would probably then be sufficient to prevent any Bakhtiari interference with traffic. The Sardar-i-Jang has promised that the question of providing and improving accommodation at the various stages, making arrangements for fodder and effecting necessary repairs to the track itself will receive his attention as money becomes available from bridge tolls, tribal revenue, &amp;c. The arrangements made, in my opinion, promise well, and Sardar-i-Jang is to be congratulated on the great deal helms accomplished in so short a time. Murteza Kulli Khan, once having decided to accept the ilbegiship, has rendered the Sardar his loyal support and assistance, which was particularly valuable when the resistance of the young khans had to be overcome. The tribal administration of the Sardar is capable and disinterested, and he is j rapidly gaining the confidence and affection of the tribesmen. In view of the excellent work so far done by the Sardar, and his undoubtedly . sincere desire to see order restored and kept in Bakhtiari territory, I venture to point out to your Excellency the importance of rendering him our utmost support, and of ensuring that the ample powers he now enjoys under his “sanad”are not modified during the full term of his appointment. I have, &amp;c. A. GBEY, Captain, I. A., Assistant Resident, Ahwaz. — .. .No. 2068, dated Bushire, the 7th (received 14th) September 1912. From—L ieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To— The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Henry McMahon, G.C.V.O., K.C.I E., C.S.L, Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign De partment, Simla. In continuation of the correspondence ending with this Residency letter No. 1950, dated 25th August, I have the honour to forward, for the information No. 49^,-232, dated 2-2gth July 1912. of the Government of India, copies of the No. 56 266 dated 5th August 10x2. marginally cited communications received No. 57-267, dated 5th August 1912. ^ from His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Ahwaz. on the subject of his recent visit to Tehran and the affairs of the Bakhtiari Khans. 2. It will be seen that Captain Grey personally has little confidence in the probable results of the Sardar-i-Jang’s “ mission ”, and the reasons which he gives, in the first enclosure to this letter, against the conclusion of a loan by Messrs Lynch Brothers to the Khans, indicate that the authority of the Ilkhani, whilst nominally absolute, will probably be little less restricted in the future than it has been in the past, by family and tribal jealousies. 3. The Khans have now been given every facility they asked for in order to enable them to set their house in order, and if they do not succeed in doing so, it will be a matter for consideration whether His Majesty’s Government would not be justified in taking some overt action towards ensuring the safety of this most important trade route. I am sending a copy of this letter to His Majesty’s Minister. V No. 49-A.-232, dated Camp Ispahan, the 2nd-2gth July 1912. From— Captain A. J. H. Grey, I. A., His Majesty’s Vice-Consul and Assistant Resident, Ahwaz, To Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. J have the honour to forward herewith copy of a memorandum which I prepared at the request of His Majesty s Minister showing the results of my visits to the various Bakhtiari Khans in Tehran, I enclose also extract of a communication which 1 subsequently addressed to His Majesty’s Minister regarding the present position of affairs in the Bakhti ari country. Shortly before my arrival in Tehran the Chief Bakhtiari Khans had approached Messrs. Lynch Brothers with the request for a loan of lomans 40,000 repayable in eight yearly instalments. They proposed, in the event of the loan being sanctioned, to hand the amount to the Sardar-i-Jang and ^ to appoint him the sole executive chief (representing both families) in Bakhtiari country. He would be charged especially with the safeguarding of the road and, to ensure his success in this direction, would in addition be formally ap pointed to the Governorship of Behbehan and^ the Kuhgelu. He would be instructed to raise and maintain properly organised and equipped guards on the road itself and on the Kuhgelu passes ; to undertake the repairs of existing caravanserais and to make proper arrangements for fodder and supplies through out the road. As security for the loan the Khans offered, in the event of their falling into arrears with the payment of the instalments or interest, to hand over the bridge tolls to Messrs. Lynch Brothers. The Khans’ request for the loan had been referred t° th &lt;; Londoy office, without criticism, by Mr. Wilson, -fetesui. Messrs. Lync h^ Broth ers Tehran agent.2 The Khans, though pressed by Mr. Wilson, had declined to provide him with any statement showing the manner in which they proposed to expend the Tomans 40,000 and confined themselves to the general statement that it would be expended in paying guards, repairing caravanserais, punitive measures against the Kughelu etcetera They clearly stated that if the money was not forthcoming they could take no steps to ensure the safety of the road. In talking over the matter with His Majesty’s Minister I expressed myself strongly of opinion that the loan would be a mistake. The reasons which led me to this conclusion were as follows :— (i) The loan amounts to a payment in consideration for which the Khans undertake to put the road in order and as such would establish a dangerous precedent, it being the duty of the Khans (Article 6 of the Road Concession) and failing them the Persian Government to ensure the safety of traffic. (ii) Our experience of payments to the Khans for definite purposes in late years has not been encouraging. Such sums have always been embezzled by the senior chiefs and in no case have they been applied to the purpose for which they were paid. (iii) Even if the amount borrowed is handed to the Sardar-i-Jang it is extremely doubtful if he will be able to accomplish anything in view of the present state of affairs in Bakhtiari country and the bitter hostility which exists between the two ruling families and even between the members of the same family. (iv) The right to assume control of the road tolls (offered as security) is already possessed by Messrs. Lynch in connection with their Road Construction bill. Messrs. Lynch Brothers could at the present moment exercise this right, the payment of their 12th instalment being 4 months overdue. (v) Each of the senior Khans has ample funds at his disposal and their excuse for borrowing is that they are incapable of combining for any common purpose. This admission indicates that we shall have considerable difficulty in recovering the sums already due to us on account of the robberies of last year w'hich amount to some £ 10,000, and the proposed loan would place the Khans still further in our debt. His Majesty’s Minister while seeing the force of the above arguments was inclined to take the view that although the chance of improvement in the condi tion of the road was a remote one, still a chance did exist, and, as His Majesty’s Government was not prepared for the present to take any active measures to hold the Khans or the Persian Government to their responsibilities in connection with the safety of the road, it was advisable to accede to the Khans’ request and take that chance. Memorandum. I visited the Sardar Assad on the 10th instant and Sardar Muhtesham and Samsam-es-Saltaneh on the 12th. The questions discussed with these Chiefs were:— 1. Sheikh-Bakhtiari differences. 2. Measures contemplated for safeguarding the Lynch road. 3. Oil Company’s affairs— {a) compensation for peasants who formerly cultivated the land now acquired by the Company ; (£) mode of delivery of the shares to which the Khans are entitled. 4. The Lynch Road Construction Account. The Khans had delayed the payment of the 12th instalment (due on March 3rd) on the plea that the account was incorrect.3 i. Sheikh-Bakhtiari differences. The Khans were unanimous in declaring that Sheikh Khaza’al had acted with great treachery in sending a force against Shushter when the town had been evacuated by the Bakhtiari chiefs, its government entrusted to the representative of the duly appointed Governor-General and a small force of Bakhtiari left at his disposal only for the purpose of preserving order in the town. The Sardar Muhtesham spoke with great heat regarding the damage that had been done to his property at Akili by the Arabs. He declared that he had suffered a loss of Tomans 100,000* through the theft of his peasants’ cattle and flocks, the burning of their villages and agricultural implements and the destruc tion of their crops. Unless the Sheikh made good this loss to the last “dinar”, he would send a force of 5,000 Bakhtiari sowarsf in the autumn to lay waste Arabistan and “ drive the Shaikh and his Arabs into the sea ”. He said that it was at the request of His Majesty’s Legation that the chiefs had ordered the acting Ilkhani and Ilbegi and Sardar Ashja’ to withdraw from Shushter and they had looked to us to prevent the Shaikh from damaging their estates. I mentioned that the Shaikh declares that the acting chiefs removed a sum of Tomans 5,000 from Shushter and claims this amount from the Khans. The Khans replied that, even if true, it is not for the Shaikh to claim the amount The town of Shushter is not his property and therefore the townsfolk are not his “ rayats ”. If they have been robbed the proper course is for them to present their claim to the Governor-General of Arafcistan who would, if substantiated, present it to the Bakhtiari chiefs. I mentioned in conversation that Arabistan was the one province in Persia which had remained quiet during the past 5 years, that we had very large commercial interests in the province and that these were bound to suffer should it become the scene of a tribal war. For this reason we were anxious to see friendly relations established between the Bakhtiaris and Arabs on a permanent footing and would do all in our power to bring about such a state of affairs. 1 he Sardar Muhtesham said that owing to the Shaikh’s raid on Akili a state of war at present existed between the Arabs and Bakhtiaris and that no peace could be made until the Shaikh had paid full compensation for the damage he had caused. When this was paid he and the other Khans were quite ready #4 to make p/ace but the Shaikh must undertake to refrain from interference in the town of Shushter, except when distinctly ordered to do so. All the Khans signified their willingness to depute a responsible chief (probably the Sardar-i*Jang)to meet a representative of the Shaikh in the vicinity of Shushter and there to discuss the points in dispute between them and the Shaikh. They said however that they could not authorise such a representative to come to a written understanding with the Shaikh without telegraphic reference to themselves. The amount to be paid as compensation for the raid on Akih could be discussed at this meeting by His Majesty s Consular representatives. The Sardar Muhtesham agreed not to commence hostilities against the Shaikh until the meeting was held and then only if the result was unsatisfactory. They said that the meeting should be held in .December when the “ H ’ have descended and all arrangements as to place, representatives etc., should be completed before that time. 2. Measures proposed for safeguarding the Lynch road. —This question was discussed with the Sardar Assad, Samsam es-Saltaneh and Sardar Muhtesham. They said that although they realize their responsibility with regard to t he * The Akili lands were leased in 1912 for Tomans 16000. r In August 1911 the Snrdars Muhtesham and Bahadur could only col'ect a force of some 1,000 Bakhtiaris to help the Government forces in repulsing the ex-Shah.4 road they are help’ess through lack of funds and unless the Tomans 40,000 asked for from Lynch are forthcoming they can take no steps to ensure its security. Should Lynch agree to give them the above sum they propose to depute the Sardar-i Jang as sole representative of both families throughout Bakhtiari territory and in addition to get him nominated as Governor of Behbehan. When I pointed out that the nomination of a Bakhtiari to the Governorship of Behbehan would be distasteful to the Shaikh they replied that without the Gover norship of Behbehan it was impossible to restrain the Kuhgelu tribes, and if we opposed them in this matter we would have only ourselves to blame for the closing of the road. 1 further asked the Khans what guarantee they would give that this Tomans 40,000 would not be dissipated by the chiefs and would really be expended for the purpose for which it is intended. They replied that they could afford no guarantee and that we must be content. Mr. Wilson tells me that if the loan was approved the Khans had agreed to give Lynch immediate control of the road tolls. The Khans however denied this to me and said that Lynch would only have the right to assume control of the tolls in the event of the Khans falling into arrears with the repayment of capital or interest. 3. Oil Company's affairs —The Khans agreed to provide land for the rayats evicted from the oil-fields and to prevent them from tresspassing on the Com pany’s property tor the future. Regarding the delivery of the Khan’s shares, I pointed out that I had definite instructions as to the mode of delivery from which I could not depart.' These instructions required the presence of all the Khans entitled to receive the shares, the Company’s representative and myself, and that such a meeting was, at present, impossible to arrange. The Khans propose approaching His Majesty’s Legation with a view to getting the instructions altered and arranging the delivery of the shares at Tehran. The Companylyobject will thus be accomplished, for a delay of 6 or 9 months will take place before the necessary arrangements can be made. 4. The Lynch Road Construction Account. I obtained a written acknowledgment of the correctness of the account from the Samsam-es Saltaneh and Sardar Muhtesham and a verbal promise to settle it as soon as possible. I will send reminders to the Khans from time to time. Extract from a communication dated Ispahan, the 28th June iQi2,from His Majesty s Vice*Con$ul } Ahwaz, to His Majesty's Minister, Tehran. * ♦ ••*** I had an interesting talk with the Sardar-i-Zafar yesterday. He laughed when I told him of Sardar Muhtesham’s threats about the Sheikh of Moham- merah and said that the other Khans would never support him in any hostile movement against the Sheikh. He said that the damage done at Akili did not exceed Tomans 3, 000 an d that the Sardar Muhtesham would never think of commencing hostilities on account of so small a sum. He thought that Sardar Muhtesham would have difficulty in raising a force of 1,000 men even for a personal quariel of this nature and would not be such a fool as to cross swords with the Sheikh with so small a following. &lt;&lt; ^ m** 1 entirely of his opinion and think the Sardar Muhtesham’s talk is mere ** hjs object being to get as much money out of the Sheikh as possible, as compensation for the Akili raid.5 Sardar-i-Zafar thought favourably of the proposal to hold a meeting of the Bakhtiari and Sheikh representatives to talk over the matters in dispute between the two tribes and considered it possible that some amicable settlement might be arrived at. I have not yet heard whether Lynch have agreed to the loan of Tomans ^.0,000 to provide the Sardar-i*Jang with funds. His chances of succeeding in putting the road in order are now, I think, even less than they were before. A new factor has arisen in the attitude lately adopted by the Amir Mujahid. This Khan has entered into a compact with Muntazzim-ud-Dowleh, Salar-i- Ashraf Sardar-i-Fateh and the brother of Zargham-us-Saltaneh (Aulad-i-Reza Kuli Khan) and is intriguing against the senior Bakhtiari Khans at Tehran and , elsewhere and trying to tamper with the loyalty of the tribesmen. _ ^ I have no doubt that he is responsible, to a certain extent, for the partici pation of the Bakhtiari tribesmen in the recent robberies on the Lynch Road. He will certainly do all in his power to frustrate the efforts of the Sardar-i- Jang to put the road in order. I will keep you informed of his conduct and, if necessary, recommend his recall from tribal territory. Letter No. 56-266, dated Camp Ispahan, the 5th August 1912. From—C aptain A. J. H. Grey, His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Ahwaz, To-—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to forward herewith, '' du Pl'^e.copy^a Nil dated the 13th July 1912, with enclosures, addressed to me by His Maje, y Minister, Tehran, on the subject of the appointment of the Sardar-i-Jang to the Ikhaniship of the Bakhtiari tribe for a period of 5 years. Letter dated Gulhek, the 13th July 1912. From—His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To— Captain A. J. H. Grey, His Majesty’ Vice-Consul, Ahwaz. When you were in Tehran on a visit lately the Bakhtiari Khans were being iressed to take immediate measures to restore order . c °“'‘ ry •specially to restore security for British trade on the Bakhtiari road. T e khans informed us, as you will remember, that they were prepared to entrust heir mission to Nassir Khan, Sardar-i-Jang, but that for this purpose he would ■ equire to borrow the sum of 40,000 Tomans for which they offered the road tolls is security. Shortly after your departure I was sounded by the Khans as to the proposed ^ ippointment of Lutf Alt Khan Amir Mufakham to the Governorship ° Kerman X. and Baluchistan. I intimated that if the Khans were unab e to ma ntam orde in their own country it was clearly out of the question for me to entertain their proposal. They subsequently offered to mortgage their shares in the Bakhtiari Oil Company and the first Exploitation Company as security tor an advance for the purpose of facilitating Sardar-i-Jang s mission. 1 , been arranged and you will see from the enclosed copies o e Tomans Khans have signed under what conditions they have borrowed 45,000 tomans from the Imperial Bank. I also enclose Persian text and translation of the document signed by the Khans appointing Sardar-i-jang “ Ilkham ’ and Murteza Kuli Khan g for five years with full powers. I have written to Sardar-i-Jang that I take note of satisfaction and wish him every success. A copy of my letter is also enclos for your information. Ha v ./, x /r vIt has been arranged that you are to accompany Sardar-i-Jang from Ispahan when he leaves for the Bakhtiari country in order to assist him at the outset of his mission to deal with the minor Khans who I understand are at present somewhat out of hand. You are authorised to impress upon them the utmost importance of assisting Sadar-i-Jang in every possible way and to threaten them if necessary with the displeasure of His Majesty’s Government if they do anything to hamper the new llkhani and Ilbegi in the execution of their duty. I trust that you will be able to achieve the object in view without much difficulty and that Sardar-i-Jang’s mission will prove an eminent success. You will see from enclosure No. 2 that the Bakhtiari Khans’ share certifi cates are to be delivered to the Imperial Ban$ and I request you to carry this out in due course. {Translation^) Copy of Agreement given to Sardar-i-Jang. In the name of God etc. We, the undersigned, have with complete confidence on this 24th day of the ^ month Rajab (1330 A.H =July 10, 1912 A.D.) by order of the Imperial Government and of our own family, appointed Sardar-i-Jang to be Governor in Chief of Bakhtiari, Chaharmahal, Kuhgelu and Behbehan from the present year Sichkan-il (March 21, 1912= March 20, 1913) until the end of the year Loin-il (March 21st, 19161a March 20th, 1917) which constitutes five complete \ears. He will independently and powerfully, with absolute authority, be inde pendent “ llkhani ” of the Bakhtiari tribe and will carry out the conditions of the following articles :— Article /. He will be, as stated above, for five complete years independently and powerfully the “ llkhani ”, and will not be liable to dismissal. During'these five years, one of the sons or descendants of the late Ilkhani will always be in partner ship with him in the capacity of “ Ilbegi” and will join him in profit orloss. For the present that person will be Murteza Kuli Khan. As long as Sardar-i-Tang is satisfied with him he will remain with Sardar-i-Jang and keep order. Whenever . ardar-t-Jang is dissatisfied with him and no longer desires that Murteza Kuli Khan should remain with him, he has the right to change Murteza Kuli Khan and to appoint another of the sons (or descendants) of the late “ llkhani ” in his place to act as his (Sardar-i~Jang’s) partner, and no one will have the right to make any objections. &amp; //.-Sardar-i-Jang and Murteza Kuli Khan have full powers with regard to the minor Khans who are the sons or descendants of Jaafar Kuli ’ lf wu 7 de r ir f’ ret ? in them in Bakh tiari and Chaharmahal, but are at liberty to expel them if they deem it necessary to do so. The Government and we ourselves will accord the utmost support. If any of the sons for escendants) of la te Jaafar Kuli Khan should disobey or rebel, they (the llkhani fo^ce ^hn, Id th ? nght to P umsh them severely with personal and tribal bkould the affai J become serious and should the disobedient person or will irAh' nghfto cmnpiam ' ° f Pr ° Perty ° r ° f n ° member ° f the /^- F ° r . tbe maintenance of order in the Bakhtiari tribe and 1 harmahal, Sardar-i-Jang and Murteza Kuli Khan are empowered and authorised to issue any orders they like or to inflict any punishment or penalty and aiithorU°d t eac men . anc * Bakhtiari.

No member of the family will on any account have the right to interfere or to claim any share. Article V .—Regarding the “ maliat ’* of Bakhtiari and Chaharmahal, it has been agreed that Sardar-i-Jang and Murteza Kuli Khan will each year pay the Government salaries and emoluments of the (Bakhtiari) family, the pay of the sowars of Sardar Ashja’ and Sardar Bahadur, which it has always been customary for the Government to pay. if there should be a small balance it is to be paid to the special Bakhtiari sowars. Should the Government claim the balance of the Bakhtiari maliat the family must be responsible for it and Sardar-i-Jang and Murteza Kuli Khan will not be answerable for the same. The existing claim of Messrs. Lynch will be payable each year by Sardar-i-Jang and Murteza Kuli Khan in accordance with the instalments laid down. Article VI .—With regard to the eight thousand pounds (^ 8,000) borrowed from the Imperial Bank on account of the shares, and given by us to Sardar-i- Jang and Murteza Kuli Khan, they will have to pay the Bank every year two thousand pounds and interest beginning from the end of the year Oud-il (March 21, 1913-March 20, 1914) and terminating at the end of the year Loin-il (March 21, 1916-March 20, 1917) which constitutes four complete years during which time the administration of Bakhtiari is in the hands of Sardar-i-Jang and Murteza Kuli Khan. In this way the whole of the eight thousand pounds, with interest, will have been paid up in four years. Should it so happen that one of these two men should die, which God forbid, their families must undertake to refund the balance of the pounds sterling due. Should it so happen (God forbid) during these four years, in each of which they must pay two thousand pounds with interest, that Sardar-i-Jang and Murteza Kuli Khan cease to interfere (in tribal affairs ?) or are dismissed, they will have to pay from the year Oud-il (1913-14) when two thousand pounds plus interest will be payable, up till such year as they actually collected the Bakhtiari maliat and other revenue. After they have ceased to collect they will have no responsibility, and such person collecting the maliat and other revenues of Bakhtiari and Chaharmahal, the bridge, the flock revenues, the petroleum etc. will have to undertake the liability. Article VII .—Regarding the maliat for the present year Sichkan-il (i 9 * 2 ‘ 13) 0 f Bakhtiari, the bridge, the flocks of Chaharmahal and Faraidan, which have been collected by the Khans of the family, every member will be responsible for the sum he has collected and must hand it all over to Sardar-i-Jang and Murteza Kuli Khan. Should they make difficulties in handing over the money Sardar-i- Jang and Murteza Kuli Khan will have the right to take it from their estates. Article VIIf .—It has been agreed that as many sowars as are necessary for Teheran, from one hundred to two thousand, will be prepared and sent to Tehran by Sardar-i-Jang and Murteza Kuli Khan, or whoever is Sardar-i-Jang s partner; on condition that the sum of fifteen tomans for each sowar is pai before their departure—for as many sowars as are required to Sardar-i-Jang and Murteza Kuli Khan who will deliver them at Tehran. Any Khan of the family who is appointed Governor will have to pay fifteen tomans per sowar toi as many sowars as he warlts Sardar-i-Jang and Murteza Kuli Khan to send and they will be depatched.

I have received from His Excellency Sardar Assad a copy of the agree- ment signed by Samsam-es-Saltaneh, Sardar Assad, Amir Mufakham and Sardar Muhtehsam, by which you are appointed Governor-in-Chief of Bakhtiari, Chahar- mahal, Kuhgelu and Behbehan for a period of five years. I observe with satisfaction that you will independently and powerfully, with absolute authority, be independent Ilkhani of the Bakhtiari tribe, and that the eight articles of the agreement communicated to me confer upon you the fullest powers and most absolute authority which it is possible to give. This document of which I am sending a translation to His Majesty’s Govern ment, will prove to them that the Ruling Chiefs of the great Bakhtiari tribe are determined to maintain security, peace, and order in Bakhtiari and the adjoining countries, and will, I am sure, afford them the utmost satisfaction. Having full confidence in your ability, integrity, devotion to duty and per sonal courage, I am confident that, if you receive the necessary support from those whose duty it is to support you in your mission, you will have no difficulty in bringing about peace and order in Bakhtiari and on the Ahwaz road, which is so important to British commerce. You will receive in your mission the fullest support from Consular Officers, and if you should be in need of my own help, I to extend such assistance to you as I properly can.

[2619 z—6]—'w WBM ——— From —Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. In continuation of the correpondence ending with this Residency letter No. 1516, dated 21st July 1912, I have the honour to forward, for the informa- , , . . tion of the Government of India, a copy No. S2-244, dated 13th July 1912. . . • j r tt- ot a communication received from His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Ahwaz, on the subject of the dissensions now prevailing amongst the Bakhtiari Khans. 2. It will be seen that whilst, as already reported, the senior Khans have been engaged with the support of His Majesty’s Minister in negotiating a loan for ^8,000 from the Imperial Bank of Persia, on the security of the shares in the Oil Company to which they are entitled, for the purpose of financing the Sardar-i-Jang, whom they have deputed as Ilkhani of the tribes and Governor of Behbehan for a period of 5 years, the junior Khans, upon whom in the absence of the senior Khans at Tehran, much of the local responsibi'ity for keeping the tribes in hand devolves, have been energetically protesting against the monopoly bv their elders of all the principal sources of profit. They appear to have been led by Yusuf Khan, Amir Mujahid, himself a senior Khan, whose failure to keep the road open this year has led to his supersession by a scion of the rival family. 3. It would appear, therefore, that in addition to the long standing feud between the two families of Khans, we have Vide my letter No. M. 21, dated 7th May. to rec k on w ith the jealousy of the younger generation of both families at the greater opportunities for enriching themselves at the expense of the State that have been enjoyed by their senior relatives. The younger Khans go so far as to hint that British interests in the shape of the security of the Ahwaz-Ispahan road may suffer if some arrangement satisfactory to themselves be not arrived at, and indeed it is obvious that any exacerbation of the present chronic family feuds between the Khans cannot fail to have a disastrous effect on their already declining authority as a corporate body. The disturbances which have annualy occurred on the road in question since 1910 are a symptom of this decline, which was directly responsible for the loss of some ^10,000 worth of British goods destroyed or rpbbed in course of transit between Ahwaz and Ispahan in 1911. This year again the road has been com pletely closed for several months by Kuhgelu or Bakhtiari tribes^ and in the earlier part of it the prevailing anarchy made it impossible for the engineer deputed Vide encloures to Foreign Department endorse- by Messrs. Lynch Brothers for the exainin- ment No. 163VE.A., dated 20th July 1912. ation and repair of one of the suspension bridges erected by them in 1903, to complete his work, though the Khans stand to lose heavily by any damage to the bridge, and were themselves paying for the necesssary repairs. The senior Khans, to whom protests were addressed by His Majesty’s Minister, assured the latter on the 28th May that no disorders need be apprehended for another two months, and that they were taking all possible measures for the protection of the road ; meanwhile robberies on a large scale commenced within a month and the road has since been almost entirely closed to traffic and the couriers of His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Ahwaz have twice been robbed and the mails destroyed. 4. His Majesty’s Minister has, however, expressed nis strong confidence in the good intentions of Sardar-i-Jang and the belief that the arrangement now arrived at, whereby the Sardar-i-Jang has been appointed for a term of 5 years, with the support and consent of the senior Khans, may result in a lasting improve ment of the conditions on the only road now open to British trade from t e south, and it is to be devoutly hoped that his confidenc^will be justified by theBakhtiari Khan referred to; it is difficult, however, in view of the unbroken series of failures of his predecessors for the past three years, the strong local opposition to his appointment as Governor of Behbehan, the jealousy of the younger Khans and the growing tide of anarchy which is sweeping over the few remaining portions of Southern Persia where some semblance of law and order had still remained, to take a sanguine view of his prospects.

Precis'. Attitude of junior Bakhtiari Khans, No. 18—243, dated Ispahan, the 13th July 1912. From— Captain A. J. H. Grey, I.A., His Majesty’s Vice-Consul and Assistant Resident, Ahwaz, To—His Excellency Sir WALTER Townley, K.C M.G., His Britannic Majesty’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minster Plenipotentiary at the Court of His Imperial Majesty the Shah of Persia, Tehran. I have the honour to report that on the 6th instant I received a visit from Sardar Fateh (Haji Ilkhani family) and Munazzam-ul-Mulk, son of the late Sardar Assad (Ilkhani family), who arrived in Ispahan on the 1st instant from the Bakhtiari territory. These two young Khans have been deputed as spokesmen, by the party of discontented younger chiefs under the leadership of Yusaf Khan (Amir Mujahid), to represent their grievances to the senior Khans in Tehran by telegraph. Their grievances, which they recounted at great length, amount to this, that, whereas the senior Khans have all appointed themselves to governorships and other important government posts with opportunities of enriching themselves, the interests of the younger Khans have been neglected, they have been charged wdth the unremunerative duty of tribal administration which properly belongs to the ruling chiefs and have received no share of the chiefs’ income collected by the latter in the capacity of tribal representatives. They mentioned particularly the sum of ^22,000 received for the Oil Fields property last year by the senior chiefs from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the further sum of ^24,000 (in shares) which they were about to receive from the same Company and said that although no portion of this money had reached the younger chiefs the senior Khans had not hestitated to order the acting Ilkhani and Ilbegi to compensate the evicted rayats and to hold them responsible should the latter attempt to cause trouble at the Oil Fields. They gave the names of the Khans who formed their party, which I have marked with an asterisk on the list of Khans which forms an enclosure to this despatch. They stated that their party was united and had the tribesmen with them and that, if the senior Khans declined to satisfy their just demands they would throw off the yoke of obedience and assume independent control of the Bakhtiari country. They requested me to inform Your Excellency of what they had said and asked whether His Majesty’s Legation would not arbitrate in the matter. They hinted that our interests, as regards the Bakhtiari road and the Oil Fields, might suffer if some arrangement, satisfactory to themselves, was not3 |* f come to and asked why we did not deal direct with the younger generation of Khans, who were the real power in Bakhtiari territory, seeing that the senior chiefs had invariably failed to carry out their obligations to us either through jealousy, greed or indifference. , I replied that I would not fail to inform Your Excellency of what they had said and ofjheir desire that His Majesty’s Legation should use its influence with the senior Khans to enable them to obtain what they considered their rights, but, I added, I was very doubtful whether Your Excellency would be prepared to interfere in a purely tribal question of this nature. As regards direct negotiations with the younger generation of chiefs, I pointed out that the Ilkhani and llbegi hold their appointments from the Persian Govern ment, by whom they are recognised as the representative chiefs of the whole Bakhtiari tribe, and for this reason we, in our negotiations with the tribe, had always dealt with them or their duly authorised representatives. I said I was very doubtful if Your Excellency would consider the possibility of any change in our policy in this matter. As regards loss to British interests in Bakhtiari territory through any cause whatever, I pointed out that we had always held, and continued to hold, the whole tribe responsible through its representative chiefs—the Ilkhani and llbegi. On the 7th instant I again met Sardar Fateh and Munazzam-ul-Mulk who informed me that their negotiations with the Khans at Tehran were progressing statisfactorily and they had hopes of an amicable settlement being arrived at. I am inclined to think that at present and probably for a year or more to come the senior Khans are in no serious danger of losing their influence or power in Bakhtiari country but the present situation is of interest as indicating the spirit which is beginning to animate the younger generation of Khans. There are now some fifty Khans of the younger generation who in the next few years will have arrived at an age when they will consider themselves entitled to enjoy the same degree of ease and luxury as are enjoyed by their fathers and uncles. The poverty-striken tribesmen have already the last possible farthing wrung from them by the chiefs and, when the young Khans realize that the tribal revenue is not sufficient to afford each of them the wealth for which they had hoped, it is more than probable that the bitter hatred and jealousy which at present exists between the Haji Ilkhani and Ilkhani families will make itself felt between members of the same families. Instead of the present two factions there would then be a dozen or more each intriguing against the other and striving to oust it from power. lr Ilkhani Family. Sons of late Hussein Kulli Khan.

From—His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Ahwaz, Ramuz, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have seen the Amir Mujahid and discussed with him the question of the I ynch Road. He holds a Sanad from Chief Bakhtiari Khans at Tehran which appoints him the representative of both families, and gives him complete power over Behbahan and the Kuhgelu tribes, including the Bahmai. He has authority to place the Bahmai under a single Chief if he thinks this course advisable, and may dismiss other Chiefs. The only stipulation is that Muhammad Hussain Khan should be left undisturbed. The executive and other Bakhtiari Khans are ordered to support him and refrain from interfering. Sardar Ashja resents the charge of the whole Bahmai being given to Amir Mujahid and is intriguing with Mohamedi section of Bahmai, who are the adherents of Haji llkhani family, and inciting them to refuse to recognise the Amir Mujahid. The other Ahmedi section of Bahmai are adherents of the llkhani family, but are numerically weaker than the Mohamedi and of less importance with regard to the Lynch Road owing to the position of their terri tory. This action on the part of Sardar Ashja renders it impossible for the Amir to proceed to Behbahan or ensure the safety of the road by placing the Bahmai in charge of the passes leading on to the road and used by lebi raiders. Unless something is done, the Amir will probably return north and the road will certainly be closed again. I recommend one of the following three courses being followed for this year:— (1) To insist on the Khans of both Ashja to depute a Mamur to accompany families at Tehran directing Sardar Amir to Behbahan, and there formally2 i * nlace the Mohamedi section under Amir’s authority, and then remove Sardar P , • r rnrn Rakhtiari country to prevent him from intriguing. The Amir should k Sh !r Irtpd to make the Y Mohamedis responsible for closing the passes used by robbers'^an'd preventing the passage of raiders through their country towards by roDDe ; s .^ nn( r, nt its length. The executive Khans should be directed to establish the usual Bakhtiari guards on the road itself, not to interfere m Am.r s government of the Bahmai, support Amtr in every way and immediately hand fver to him the three guns they have with them at present. (2) To give up the idea of ensuring the safety of the road by restraining the Kuhgelu, and instead to insist on the executive Khans guarding xu ge u passes and the road itself with Bakhtiari guards. Five hundred would be neces- sarv but unless they are properly paid and supervised, they would be more of a danger than safeguard, and I am therefore doubtful of the expediency of this course. (T) To appoint a member of the Haji Ukhani family to^ the Joint-Governor ship of Behbahan and the Kuhgelu with Amir Mujahid. Sardar Ashja '™ ul not accept this position and the other Khans now in the Kishlaq are n°t ° f sufficient importance. There would be delay in finding a suitable man for the post. Of the above three courses, the first appears to be more likely to produce the effect which we wish and has the additional advantage of according with the wishesof 'he Khans as expressed in their Sanad The intrigues of the Sardar Ashja and the executive Khans alone have rendered it unworkable up to the present. Enclosure No. 2. jsj 0&gt; 271—87, dated Camp Ramuz, the 19th April 191a. From—C aptain A. J. H. Grey, I.A., His Majesty’s Vice-Consul and Assistant Resident, Ahwaz, To Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to refer to my telegram* No. 12—23, dated the 18th April 1912, and to forward herewith a rough • Enclosure No. .. translation of the Sanad held ^ by Amir Mujahid from the Chief Khans of the Bakhtiari Ilkhani and Haji Ilkhani families which was shown to me by that Chief. It is evident from this that the Khans in Tehran intended that the Amir Mujahid should have sole control of all the Kuhgelu tribes, including the Bahmai, of which the Mohamedi sub-section owes allegiance to the Haji Ilkhani family and the smaller Ahmedi sub-section to the Ilkhani family. The chiefs of the Mohamedi are Muhammad Hussain Khan and Ali Murad Khan, and of the Ahmedi, Hussain Khan and Zakki Khan. As you will remark, it is stipulated in the Sanad that Muhammad Hussain Khan should not be disturbed, the inference being that, if Amir Mujahid wished to place the whole Bahmai under one chief, that chief should be Muhammad Hussain Khan. I am assured that the Bahmai tribesmen of both sub-sections would accept Muhammad Hussain Khan as their sole chief provided Hussain ^ Khan were removed from their midst, and this is the course which Amir Mujahid proposes to pursue should he be relieved from the intrigues of Sardar Ashja and other Haji Ilkhani chiefs and given a free hand. Owing to the blood feud that exists between the chiefs of the Ahmedi and Mohamedi sub-sections, it is doubtful if the experiment of placing the Mohamedi sub-section only with its own chiefs in charge of the territory giving access to the Lynch Road would prove a success. The only alternative open to Amir Mujahid is therefore to unite the two sub-sections under one chief and make him' 3 responsible that this territory is closed to Tebi and other Kuhgelu raiding parties. To make clear my telegram, referred to above, I should explain that the ^ Lynch Road can only be reached by Tebi raiders through the Bahmai (Mohamedi) country, and it is only when the Bahmai are in league with such raiders (as was the case last year) or themselves out of control that robberies on that road are to be feared. The intrigues of the Haji Ilkhani Khans which resulted in the murder of Ali Nakki Khan form subject of a separate report. Sub-enclosure to Enclosure No. 2. 6th Safar 1330. All the Bakhtiari Khans of both families in accord have agreed to the following — The Amir Mujahid shall go to Behbahan as Governor of the Kuhgelu. (1) The town and all the tribes of Kuhgelu are placed under the Amir Mujahid to govern as he pleases, and he has powers to punish and reward as seems to him best. In the government of the tribes the Bakhtiari Khans of either family have no right to interfere and must not act against Amir Mujahid’s will or wishes. (2) Regarding the Bahmai tribes, it has formerly been the custom for the Ilkhani and Haji Ilkhani families to send separate representa tives to this tribe, now, for the sake of the safety of the Bakhtiari road, it has been thought advisable to give the charge of the whole Bahmai tribe to Amir Mujahid and to empower him to give the chieftainship of the whole tribe to one or two individuals as he sees fit, and to dismiss the other tribal chiefs with the exception of Muhammad Hussain Khan (son of Ali Muhammad Khan) who shall be allowed to remain at Qaleh Aula. The Bakhtiari Khans are to help the Amir Mujahid in punishing any Bahmai chief whom may wis.i to be punished. (3) The executive chiefs will aid and support the Amir Mujahid whenever necessary and if required send him tufangchis and sowars.

Enclosure No. 7. Telegram P., No. 13, dated 25th (received 26th) May 1912. From — His Majesty’s Consul-General, Ispahan, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, at Mohammerah. I have sent to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, the following telegram, No. 58, dated the 24th May : Begins. Please see your telegrams 41 and 42 on the subject of the Ahwaz Road. It is reported by Captain Grey, who traversed the road between the 24th April and the 21st May, that, owing to the intrigues of-5C. i 5 the Sardar Assad, Amir Mufakhan, has failed in his mission to punish the Kuhgelus or to make the Bahmai responsible for holding the passes used by Tebi raiders, and he is now returning to Ispahan. Beyond the construction of six towers which are, however, as yet unoccupied no arrangements have been made by the executive Khans for the security or safety of the road. Information has been received by Grey from reliable sources to the effect that the Kuhgelus are already in the vicinity prepared to raid as soon as the Bakhtiari tribesmen have come up. There is in these circumstances a practical certainty that the road will shortly relapse into anarchy. Road conditions have been discussed carefully by us and we would recommend— Firstly t that the Sardar Assad be removed to Tehran. This is a qua non. Secondly, that for this year the following arrangement might be tried. It was suggested by the Khans themselves on their downwards journey of autumn 1911. If it meets with any measure of success, scheme for a permanent arrangement would be elaborated by us on similar lines, viz., that throughout the danger season a sufficient number (say 200 or 300) of tribesmen occupying villages on or near the road be ordered to remain in their villages. If possible they should be provided with modern arms and ammunition. Their duties would be to patrol the roads, garrison the towers recently constructed and guard the caravanserais. It is essential that a regular and adequate salary in cash ho. paid to these guards (the present arrangement of compensation by the remission of revenue is absolutely worthless). For carrying out the above arrangements, the best means at present available appears to be that Azizulla, Lynch’s Head Road Inspector, be charged with the payment and exercise of general supervision over the road guards. If difficulty in regard to cash payments could be overcome, Aziz-ulla would probably be a persona grata to the Khans. About the middle of June the dangerous season begins and lasts to the end of September. The above arrangements are therefore urgent. Grey is prepared, if these proposals materialise, to go to Chahar-Mahal and use his influence with the executive Khans to induce them to carry them out locally. This morning, in an interview with an emissary of the Sardar Assad, I explained that no personal ill-feeling was felt by me against the... ?... , that it was from the Legation that the complaints emanated and that the matter should therefore be discussed with you in Tehran by the Sardar. It was stated by the emissary that the Sardar had intended going to Tehran and a promise was given by him that he would urge him to do so. G. C. B. P., Simla.—No, C3T F.
