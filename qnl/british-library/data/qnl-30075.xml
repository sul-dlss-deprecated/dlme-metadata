POLITICAL AGENCY, MUSCAT, Dated 20th March, 1946. To The Hon’ble the Persian Gulf, Political Resident, Bushire. Memorandum. The moment appears opportune for considpring in what ways the capital now available both from the State and the mer cantile communities of Muscat could be directed towards increas ing prosperity and providing additional employment. Such de velopment is not only essential to any improvement in the standard of living but would also be of considerable consequence in future political developments. Prosperity in the coastal towns might do much to break down the self-imposed isolation of the interior. Leadership in this field would cause the tribes tc look more to wards the Sultan than the Imam for the betterment of their condi tions. 2. The first end most obvious field which might.be examined is fisheries. At present commercial activity in this sphere is limited to the export of fish manures and reals and certain quan tity of mother of pearl. The possibility of introducing a fish canning industry might be considered though I am doubtful whether this would prove successful. Sardines are plentiful: but their season is short, and successful competition with large scale can neries elsewhere would seem impossible. Moreover supplies of olive oil are not available from any source close at hand. It is very possible, however, that such commodities as fish oils, mother of pearl buttons etc. might form the basis of an industrial enterprise. An examination of Muscat’s fisheries by an expert from tfoe Directorate of Fisheries, Government of India, would appear to be the first step necessary to the pursuance of any pos sibilities of this nature. 3. From the information available, conditions for cotton grow ing in the interior appear to he good. Purports of raw cotton from Muscat are at present small, but vith encouragement, cotton growing might result in much added prosperity. There would appear to be no obvious reason why a small cotton textile factory could not be established in Muscat for the manufacture of cheap textiles for internal consumption. In the initial stages, most of the cot ton for this enterprise would have to be imported, but sources of supply within the range of sailing ere ft are available. As a raw material to be imported, cotton would appear to have the advantage that its production is sufficiently wide spnead to prevent any fear of external price manipulation. A local demand for cotton could be expected to foster a desire amongst local growers to use Improved seed in order to secure better prices. The eco nomics of such an enterprise would require expert examination and the Government of India may be in a position to^ecommend the best source from which an expert, willing to conduct examination, might be found. 4. The town of Sur is one of the key points in the State so far as the tribal affairs are concerned. Any increase in pros perity and opportunity for employment at this town would inevitably- 2 - attract the tribes towards it and help to break down the factional disputes between them which are a continual menace to the tranquility of this area. The suggestion which might be examined with particular reference to this town is the possibility of cement manufacture. Although very little information regarding the raw materials and processing re quired for cement is available here, it is understood that many alternatives have now been found to the original method of processing an admixture of chalk and clay. There is no lack of limestone in the vicinity of Sur and the coal-seam beyond Sur examined by Von Krafft of the Survey of India in 1901 might form the source of power and heat required for process ing. In this connection the Government of India may be able to arrange for the supply of sufficient general information in order to .ascertain whether there e.re sufficient prospects to justify expert examination. 5. If no objection is seen, it is requested that the Government of India be approached accordingly. Possible developments in the fields of irrigation and agriculture are being taken up separately.

The Sultan feels that the possibilities of setting up a textile factory in Muscat should not be examined until he has had the opportunity of making en agricultural survey to review the possibilities of growing raw cotton. Rather than employing Mr. Sidebottom therefore, the Sultan would prefer to obtain for a few months on de putation the services of an agricultural expert. If the Government of India are unable to assist in this matter, it is possible that the Middle-East Organisati may be able to do so. Political Agent, Muscat. {Signature) S. 44.

If you see no objection would you kindly 2 ascertain whether the Sultan is willing to bear the cost of the printing? He probably does not require as many as 750 copies, but the cost of printing a smaller nuriiber of copies is not likely to be much less than - that quoted for the 750. Please also confirm that the Sultan would like to hold the copyright of the report. 3. If there Is no early mail please reply by telegram. \ P.D. Stobart, Esquire Political Agent, Muscat(E 4399/73/91) FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 17th April, 1948. CONFIDENTIAL. Dear Residency, Dr. Bertram has suggested that his report on the fisheries of Muscat and Oman might be printed by the Stationery Office at His Majesty's Government's cost as an act of courtesy towards a friendly Ruler. ft It is not at all certain that the Treasury would agree to pay the printing costs which it is estimated would be £130.0s.0d. for 750 copies and £7.0s.0d. for each additional 250 copies nor would we wish to issue hie report as an official publication. It seems probable also to us that the Sultan who has defrayed the cost of Dr. Bertram's visit would prefer to hold the copyright of his report and as in the case of Sir Cyril Fox's recent report pay for the printing costs himself. Should this be the case we could, if the Sultan so wished, arrange for.the report to be printed by the Stationery Office at his cost. We would be grateful if you let us have your views. Yours ever.
