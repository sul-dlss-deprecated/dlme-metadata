Md (%t- iJfc^aUe^ MP&amp; loMifS ddu Legal Adviser^ In our express letter of 11th September (flagged) we forwarded to the Political Resident a draft Trucial States Order- in-Council revised in consultation with yourself and the Foreign Office to take account of the changed position in the Persian Gulf resulting from the transfer of administration from the Government of India to the U.K. Government and the changed constitutional position in India. We asked the Political Resident to consider^ t^iis revised draft of the Trucial States Order-in-Council and, if he agreed with it, to let us have drafts of the other Persian Gulf Orders-in-Council revised on the same lines. 2. The Political Resident has now done this and with his letter No.424-S of 17th February has forwarded revised drafts of the other Orders-in-Council. I have not examined these in detail but can see nothing to dispute^/the conments given in his letter No.424-3. Before forwarding his letter and the revised drafts to the Foreign Office I should be glad to know whether you have any comments. 3. Please see now the Political Resident's letter No.425-3 of 17th February. The suggestion of appointing a judge from England to try important cases was originally put forward in the Foreign Office ; who foresee difficulty^now tnat they will have to fill the appointments of Political Resident and Political Agents from the P'oreign Senvice (except insofar as they are able to fill the appointments “by ex-officers of the Indian Services on contract)^ in providing officers who have the requisite training in the Law (mainly Indian) to enable them to administer the Persian Gulf Orders in Council. It appears from the Political Resident's letter No.2*25-3 that the necessary provision for the appointment of such a judge^ as Judicial Assistant to the Political Resident^ already exists in the Orders-in-Council but the Political' Resident is worried about his own competence (and that of ary Political Resident) to dispose of appeals against ary Orders passed by such an expert and wonders whether it might be as well to make provision in the revised Orders-in-Council to enable the Political Resident to refer to a Court in the U.K. aiy appeal whicn he does not himself feel competent to decide or which he may be directed by the Secretary of State to transfer. I should be glad to have your comments on this also. 1-3.43.Reference Paper Legal Adviser’s Department. Hefei 190 . While I see no necessity for the inclusion of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act in the list of 4cts mentioned in Article 12 (1) of the Order - the Order itself being made under that Act - I think the reference to Section 6 thereof in Article 17 of the Order is necessary, or at any rate advisable,in as much as it is under that Section that power is conferred to send a person for trial 'to any British possession for the time being appointed on that behalf by Order in Council'*. The original Article 17 appointed Bombay. There is, of course, no reason why any other British possession should not be so appointed, but I think the place selected should be specified. I may mention in reference to the Political Residents suggestion,that the U.K. is not a British possession within the meaning of the Interpretation Act - nor of course is any other of the Gulf territories in which His Majesty exercises jurisdiction. The Political Resident could however, I have no doubt, always exercise the power to transfer and try any case himself under Section 526 (l)(iii) of the Criminal Procedure Code. I have no comment on the point referred in paragraph 5 of the rolitical Residents lett^fj^save that I do not quite follow the necessity mentioned Tji paragraph 3(^&gt;) of Mr. Harrison's letter of the 11th September, 1547, for an amendment of Article 20, the present terms of which appear to cover the sending of the convict to any foreigh jurisdiction place. This is also apparently within the powers conferred by Section 7 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act. As to the more general question of an experienced lawyer being ade available for the trial of important or diffiou t cases, I agree that such a lawyer could be appo:lnted ‘.judicial as istant under the Order as it stands, but I appreciate the difficulty felt by the Political Resident as to appeals. It is possible* however - and the ;&gt;oint might perhaps be put to the Foreign Office - that the difficulty might be met by conferi-ing appellate jurisdiction in such cases on so e convenient court in a British possession und r Section 5 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act. 7 * # 13223.

V/ith regard to paragraph 5 of 0 ir X. hay's letter II 0 . 424 -S I think we may agree with this. If we now put the revised drafts to the Governments of India and Pakistan it would be months before they let us have their views and the Goverrment of India then would probably raise the awkward question of transferring jurisdiction over Indians in the Sheikhdoms to an Indian representative (the Government of India wanted to appoint a Consul at Bahrein; they have now agreed to call him a Trade Agent but have suggested that he should have the functions of a Consul. I do not think we could possibly agree to transfer our rights of extra-territorial jurisdiction over Indians and I am sure the Sheikh of Bahrein would be most reluctant to agree). x/w/. 4a / ACC S.y VI laXteJ_ % rf-C- e ft&gt; iovd* $ • ~ / .it I Vo Ju-iL L n , tt-IUn Jilt fc' ■' it ft- ■ £&gt; u. c X‘ J , W 1 -V7 ut. fe t.t. xt, &gt;•» ^h r - f¥p. Pyv.6 . U ite. z\ f. o JI. Mr. Oxley I am sorry to have to trouble you with a reference on this rather complicated subject at this late stage of the proceedings. The problem with which we are grappling is the revision of the various Persian Gulf Orders in Council so as to bring ^ them into line with the changed constitutional position in India a.id the fact that the U.K. Government now have sole administrative responsibility^so far as these Persian Gulf States are concerned. Taping the Trucial States Order in Council as a basis we produced a revised version of this (at Ext. 1714/47) and sent it to the Political Resident with the request that he should produce revised versions of the other Orders-in-Council on the same lines. This he did in his letter of 17th February at 2 on this file. Sir K. Kemp commented in his minute of 2nd March, 1948, on the various points outstanding; we passed these comments on to the Foreign Office, who have now replied in Mr. i 1 itzMaurice* s letter of 21st July. Taking his points in order: (1) The object of providing for trial elsewhere than in the Sheikhdoms is touched on in paragraph 2 of the Political Resident's letter of 17 th February. Before 1947 Bonbay, as the place to which a person might be sent for trial, fitted nicely into the picture. Article 11 of the Order in Council providing that jurisdiction in the Sheikhdoms should be exercised in accordance with procedure etc. observed by tte Courts in Bombay. If, however, we are now to replace Bombay by Cyprus we come up against a difficulty because the Courts in Cyprus do not, I imagine, use the same Indian legal code and practices as those used under the Persian Gulf Orders in Council and at Bombay atv^ might not be capable of interpreting and applying Indian law on which these Orders in Council are based. An alternative preferable to Cyprus might be Aden, where I believe Indian law is still used. In any case this is a matter primarily for the Colonial Office, whose agreement will have to be secured by the foreign Office. Have you any comments and anything which you can add on the subject of legal procedure in Cyprus and Aden? ( 2 ) I can see no need for the proviso at end of Article 20(l) to be retained. Sir K. Kemp had no comment on this point in his minute of 2/3/48. We may agree to omission? (3) Sir K. Kemp asked in his minute of 1st September, 1947, whether there was any point in retaining Article 88 (l), with the implication that there was not. We may agree to omission? (4) See paragraph 2 of Sir K. Kemp's minute of 2nd March, 1948. may agree that there is no need to amend earlier part of Article 20 (l) (apart from deletion of reference to Bombay)? (5) As regards the question of provision for appeal to a convenient court in a British possession, the same considerations apply as those mentioned in (l) above, i.e. such a Court of Appeal mist presumably have acquaintance with Indian law and Legal procedure, and in view of this Aden may be more suitable than Cyprus. Here again Fareigi Office will have to get agreement of Colonial Office. Have you any comments?* s; Mr. Harrison, _(1) (a) The question as to original trial in a British possession is radically different from the question of an appeal to a British possession in that under section 6 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 18^0, the trial Court will try and determine the offence in accordance with the laws in force in the possession. If persons likely to be tried under Article 17 will mostly, Indians, I would agree that it would be appropriate to specify a possession whose Courts have experience of trying Indians or to specify a Court with such experience. I do not know whether the Courts in Cyprus have such experience but I imagine the Courts in Kenya do. (b) If the Court is not specified but only the possession the supreme criminal court of that possession will have jurisdiction (vide s. 6 ). That may rule out an appeal within the possession. However, the F.O. will have to be guided by the Colonial Office. Article 17 should be omitted., I think the words 'for trial' in the first para. of 4 (2) I suppose that the proviso to Article 20 was included originally for some purpose f which may, possibly, have been tp prevent a foreign subject being sent to a place in which by treaty etc. H.M.’s jurisdiction extends only to British subjects. Even if that were the reason I doubt the necessity for the proviso as a foreigier would not, of course be sent to a place where H.H 1 . had no power to carry out the sentence. (3) Article 88(1) should certainly be omitted. Ihe Indian Extradition Act, 1903# has no force in the trucial states and it is no longer proper for the U.K.Government to purport to preserve powers of the Governments of India or Pakistan or of the Governors-General. (4) I agree that no further amendment of Article 20(l) is necessary. (3) The question of providing for the appeal now under consideration arose, I understand, from the suggestion that it might be necessary to appoint an experienced lawyer for the trial of important or difficult cases. It seems to me that those are Mam. cases for which Article 17 should be used and that there is. Therefore, no necessity to provide specially for an appeal. If, however, that is not so and if it may be necessary to appoint an experienced lawyer as suggested, I agree that provision should be made in the Order for an appeal to an appropriate Court in a British possession in place of the appeal to the Chief Court. The Court in the British possession must be empowered to determine the appeal. It is not sufficient simply to specify the possession (s*9 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act). An addition to Article 36 might be worded:- '.Vhere the Chief Court certifies that it is not expedient that any such appeal shall be determined by it the Chief Court shall transmit the said petition of appeal and other papers received therewith to /_ name of Court in British possession^/ and that Court shall have juris diction to determine the appeal. The Article will also ha’re to make provision respecting the exercise.of the jurisdiction so conferred and will havs to provide that the judgment or order of the Court shall be enforced in the trueial states as a judgment or order of the Chief Court. The Court to be specified may have observations to offer respecting the exercise of its jurisdiction. As it is to determine the appeal in place of the Chief Court, it should, I think, do so according to the laws under which the Chief Court/Court would have acted. It would be sufficient to add to the amendment already suggested:- and shall exercise that jurisdiction according to the laws provided by this Order for appals to the Chief Court. Ahen the name of Courty shall have determined the appeal it shall remit the said petition of appeal and other papers with a certified copy of its judgment or order to the Chief Court and such last -- mentioned judgment or order shall be carried into effect &lt; as judgment or order of the Chief Court. 5th August, 1948. ^ ' 0£U 1' /- /£r 4 T* 7(C ^ ir, - r-t * 3 //_ . PAQ+r*** &gt; , d ^ ^ ^ ^ 4- ... ^ Mr. Harrison. I should have given the reason for omitting 'for trial' from Article 17. I have now .added it to the appropriate sente.:ce¥^ With regard to (5), I think the judge should come before the lawyer so as not to suggest that the judge will not have ceased to he an experienced lawyer, J although that is what lawyers sometimes think when they lose a ca: . P t &gt; e • ^ ^ I think the j»n upe^otion of- the aegro-i-*M sentence of (5), which refers to appeals in case's tried in “a British Possession^ puts the sentences which follow out of joint. More over It is not, strictly, accurate to say that the P.R. can transfer. '^he P.R. can certify that certain circumstances exist and it must* he provided by the Order in Council that the result of those circumstances is that the appeal is transferred. Section 9 provides that His Majesty may by Order in Council con fer jurisdiction. I, therefore, suggest an amendment to (l) to cover that point and I have made two amendments, which I think are conseipuential, at the end of the dr^-ft.;Vd 0 - i , 6 / g u&amp;v fe O-.e-, lli^AA^Uc^ &gt;' C&gt; • ^ l^.O-K^v^^js A- 6 &lt;, 1 ^ \)j 0 v&lt; 2° , ilv. 1 - S&gt;- i ri- ^W^rvoo v, M 1 ' OxU*] ^ Ld fW I 0LSZ\^ JUj4 ^ JWI^ ^oJ^m &amp;su^hj-j 0^14 )^Qaju^JI flxs?

What I understand the P.O. wish to know (end of para 3 of their letter to Dale dated 9th September) is whether,in cases tried in Bombay tfnder Article 17, section 6 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act was considered to permit an appeal, if such appeal was provided for by the law regulating criminal pro cedure in Bombay. 2. Up to 1943 the Code of Criminal Procedure would not have permitted an appeal from a High Court Judge trying a case under Article 17. A point of law in that trial could, assuming s.6 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act did not prevent it, have been re viewed by the High Court at the instance of that2* In Article ll(3) the date should surely be 'the specified date'. 3* Jurisdiction to try and determine a case transferred to Bombay under Article 17 was given by s ,6 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890, That j-egti on is not applicable to a case transferred tp anothej*jurisdiction country. Section 9 of that Act contains a power to confer any jurisdiction on any Court held under the authority of the Crown, The wording is not particularly apt to the conferring of jurisdiction to determine a transferred case but I know of no other authority for what is contained in Article 17* As the section gives a power to confer juris diction, the Order in Council must confer on the receiving Court jurisdiction to try and determine the case* There should also be provision for giving effect in the Trucial States to the Qat 0 r etc Courts judgment. 4* (a) It has always struck me as odd that a 'District Court' should have been referred to in connection with criminal matters. In the Code of Criminal Procedure the Court ii. called the Court of Session, The Dis trict Court appears in the Code of Civil Procedure, (b) Until the present draft Order,the only reference to the District Court in the-part dealing with criminal matters has been in the first Article of that part. Do the old files relating th the Persian Gulf Orders disclose when and why that reference, namely, the reference to the ratified sentence of the Qa i being regarded as a decision of the Political Agent in the District Court, was included? The earliest Order I have is the 1913 Bahrein Order in which the reference appears. The present draft, by defining 'the Court' as the Chief Court and the District Court, converts what were previously references to the Court of the Political Agent or Judicial Assistant to references to the District Court, (c) The above is not a comment as to -substance, but as to something which strikes me as slightly confusing, I would,therefore, in the definition of 'the Court' insert 'Court of Session' after 'Chief Court' and in the definition of 'District Court' I would insert 'or ‘Court of Session’'. As a result of those amendments I would alter 'District Court' in Articles 12,15 and 17 to 'Court of Session'. 5* Article 40 and.Article 52 do not give power to refer a point of Muhammld^n law to a Qazi. Each article pro vides that nothing in it shall prevent such a reference. I think the wording should be amended to give that power expressly, 6 , ife have not been asked by the Foreign Office to comment on the draft Order but if they have a meeting to discuss it the above may be of help ■Q. ^ f 0 DEC ;CuV.«. ^ ' ilas Emery &gt; A copy of each of the Persian Gulf Orders in Council is now attached at enclosure to 18, and the Registry has sufficient spares to enable two copies to be sent to the High Commissioners in New Delhi and Karachi, I presume it is not necessary to send them to Colombo.

EXPLANATORY NOTE (This Note is not part of the Order, but is intended to indicate its general purport.) 1. This Order-in-Council relating to Bahrein should be read with the Orders relating to Kuwait, Qatar, Muscat and the Trucial States which were made at the same time as this Order. 2. In the territory of all these States, by agreement with their rulers. His Majesty exercises jurisdiction over certain persons and property. The extent of this jurisdiction varies slightly in the different ’States. This jurisdiction has been exercised under Order-in-Council made for each State or the Trucial States group under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890. 3. The Orders were mutatis mutandis the same for each State or group of States and have a certain unity arising from the fact that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is His Majesty’s Principal Representative and is also the Chief Judge of the Superior Court in each State or group of States. 4. Prior to 14th August, 1947, the Governor-General of India exercised a number of powers under these Orders-in-Council. and the Indian Codes were the foundation of the law applied in these territories. After the entry into force of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, it was decided that the Orders must be amended to transfer elsewhere all powers hitherto exercised by theGovernor-General of India, and this is one of the principal objects to be achieved by the present Order and similar ones made for the other Persian Gulf States. 5. At the same time it was decided to make certain minor changes in the constitution of the Courts set up under the Orders and in particular to provide: — (i) for a professional legal judge to sit in the Superior Court as assistant judge to the Political Resident; (ii) ^r a suitable Court of Appeal on which professional judges would sit, ciiosea ad hoc from a panel consisting of the Judges of the High Courts of Cyprus and Kenya and members of the Bar of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland of not less than 9 years’ standing. 6.

EXPLANATORY NOTE {This Note is not part of the Order, but is intended to indicate its general purport.) 1. This Order-in-Council relating to Kuwait should be read with the Orders relating to Bahrein, Qatar, Muscat, and the Trucial States which were made at the same time as this Order. 2. In the territory of all these States, by agreement with their ru’ % His Majesty exercises jurisdiction over certain persons and property. Thu extent of this jurisdiction varies slightly in the different 'States. This jurisdiction has been exercised under Order-in-Council made for each State or the Trucial States group under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890. 3. The Orders were mutatis mutandis the same for each State or group of States and have a certain unity arising from the fact that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is His Majesty’s Principal Representative and is also the Chief Judge of the superior Court in each State or group of States. 4. Prior to 14th August, 1947, the Governor-General of India exercised a number of powers under these Orders-in-Council, and the Indian Codes were the foundation of the law applied in these territories. After the entry into force of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, it was decided that the Orders must be amended to transfer elsewhere all powers hitherto exercised by the Governor-General of India, and this is one of the principal objects to be achieved by the present Order and similar ones made for the other Persian Gulf States. 5. At the same time it was decided to make certain minor changes in the constitution of the Courts set up under the Orders and in particular to provide :— (i) for a professional legal judge to sit in the Superior Court as assistant judge to the Political Resident: (ii) for a suitable Court of Appeal on which professional judges would sit, chosen ad hoc from a panel consisting of the Judges of the High Courts of Cyprus and Kenya and members of the Bar of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland of not less than 9 years standing. 6. Finally it was desired to provide that a case occurring in any one of the States could, when desirable, be transferred for trial in any other and that persons sentenced to imprisonment by the court in any one of the States could be removed to serve his sentence in any other of the States.

This Order-in-Council relating to Muscat should be read with the Orders relating to Bahrein, Kuwait, Qatar and the Trucial States which were made at the same time as this Order. 2. In the territory of all these States, by agreement with their rulers. His dBtjesty exercises jurisdiction over certain persons and property. The extent of this jurisdiction varies slightly in the different States. This jurisdiction has been exercised under Order-in-Council made for each State or the Trucial States group under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890. 3. The Orders were mutatis mutandis the same for each State or group of States and have a certain unity arising from the fact that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is His Majesty’s Principal Representative and is also the Chief Judge of the Superior Court in each State or group of States. 4. Prior to 14th August, 1947, the Governor-General of India exercised a number of powers under these Orders-in-Council, and the Indian Codes were the foundation of the law applied in these territories. After the entry into force of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, it was decided that the Orders must be amended to transfer elsewhere all powers hitherto exercised by the Governor-General of India, and this is one of the principal objects to be achieved by the present Order and similar ones made for the other Persian Gulf States. 5. At the same time it was decided to make certain minor changes in the constitution of the Courts set up under the Orders and in particular to provide: — (i) ’for a professional legal judge to sit in the Superior Court as assistant judge to the Political Resident: (ii) for a suitable Court of Appeal on which professional judges would sit, chosen ad hoc from a panel consisting of the Judges of the High Courts of Cyprus and Kenya and members of the Bar of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland of not less than 9 years’ standing. 6. Finally it was desired to provide that a case occurring in any one of the States could, when desirable, be transferred for trial in any other and that persons sentenced to imprisonment by the court in any one of the States could be removed to serve his sentence in any other of the States.I *- STATUTORY INSTRUMENTS 1949 No. 594 FOREIGN JURISDICTION MUSCAT The Muscat Order in Council, 1949 a V LONDON PRINTED AND PUBLISHED BY HIS MAJESTY’S STATIONERY OFFICE To be purchased directly from H.M.

EXPLANATORY NOTE {This Note is not part of the Order, but is intended to indicate its general purport.) 1. This Order-in-Council relating to Qatar should be read with the Orders relating to Bahrein, Kuwait, Muscat and the Trucial States which were made at the same time as this Order. 2. In the territory of all these States, by agreement with their rulers. His Majesty exercises jurisdiction over certain persons and property. The extent of this jurisdiction varies slightly in the different States. This jurisdiction has been exercised under Order-in-Council made for each State or the Trucial States group under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890. 3. The Orders were mutatis mutandis the same for each State or group of States and have a certain unity arising from the fact that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is His Majesty’s Principal Representative and is also the Chief Judge of the superior Court in each State or group of States. 4. Prior to 14th August, 1947, the Governor-General of India exercised a number of powers under these Orders-in-Council, and the Indian Codes were the foundation of the law applied in these territories. After the entry into force of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, it was decided that the Orders must be amended to transfer elsewhere all powers hitherto exercised by the Governor-General of India, and this is one of the principal objects to be achieved by the present Order and similar ones made for the other Persian Gulf States. 5. At the same time it was decided to make certain minor changes in the constitution of the Courts set up under the Orders and in particular to provide :— (i) for a professional legal judge to sit in the Superior Court as assistant judge to the Political Resident: (ii) for a suitable Court of Appeal on which professional judges would sit, chosen ad hoc from a panel consisting of the Judges of' the High Courts of Cyprus and Kenya and members of the Bar of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland of not less than 9 years’ standing.

EXPLANATORY NOTE (This Note is not part of the Order, but is intended to indicate its general purport.) 1. This Order-in-Council relating to the Trucial States should be read with the Orders relating to Bahrein, Kuwait, Qatar and Muscat which were made at the same time as this Order. 2. In the territory of all these States, by agreement with their rulers. His Majesty exercises jurisdiction over certain persons and property. The extent of this jurisdiction varies slightly in the different States. This jurisdiction has been exercised under Order-in-Council made for each State or the Trucial States group under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890. 3. The Orders were mutatis mutandis the same for each State or group of States and have a certain unity arising from the fact that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is His Majesty’s Principal Representative and is also the Chief Judge of the Superior Court in each State or group of States.(4172) (N. 97) 4/49 D.L. 4. Prior to 14th August, 1947, the Governor-General of India exercised a number of powers under these Orders-in-Council, and the Indian Codes were the foundation of the law applied in these territories. After the entry into force of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, it was decided that the Orders must be amended to transfer elsewhere all powers hitherto exercised by the Governor-General of India, and this is one of the principal objects to be achieved by the present Order and similar ones made for the other Persian Gulf States. 5. At the same time it was decided to make certain minor ch^ges in the constitution of the Courts set up under the Orders and in ^ ticular to provide: — (i) for a professional legal judge to sit in the Superior Court as Assistant Judge to the Political Resident: (ii) for a suitable Court of Appeal on which professional judges would sit, chosen ad hoc from a panel consisting of the Judges of the High Courts of Cyprus and Kenya and members of the Bar of England. Scotland and Northern Ireland of not less than 9 years’ standing. 6 . Finally it was desired to provide that a case occurring in any one of the States could, when desirable, be transferred for trial in any other and that persons sentenced to imprisonment by the court in any one of the States could be removed to serve his sentence in anv other of the States.

Sir, re: Kuwait and Bahrein. V/e have been referred to you with res pect to our enquiry as to patent protection in Kuwait and Bahrein. Clients of ours are seeking patent protec tion in these districts, and are uncertain whe ther protection will be granted by the Indian Patent Office or by the Pakistan Patent Office. We believe that it may be possible that neither oi these Patent Offices is responsible for the administration of patent protection in these two districts, but that the' British Foreign Office is the responsible authority. We should be grateful for your assistance in clarifying the matter for our clients.

We then hope to arrange for you to send a representative to discuss the problem further with us, perhaps sometime in December. You will remember that the principal points raised at ^ric Becketts room when you were in London the meet in •• in Sir were as follows: 1 . 2 . 3 . 4. rlace 0 -u imprisonment — could prisoners be brought back to the United Kingdom to serve their sentence? We are still awaiting the views of the Home Office. This does not however affect the drafting of the Order - see Article 20 . Provision should be made for hearing counsel in certain cases. It seems to me that this could most appropriately be done by rules of court under Article 75. Provision should be made for the hearing of appeals where desirable by a special court constructed similarly to the Full coart under the igypt Orders in Council, instead of by tue Political Resident. Our suggested amendment to meet this point is contained in Article 10A o p the draft. A date should be fixed after which amendments to the Indian laws.in force in the Trucial States should case to be applicable. The 14 th August 1947 now seems more appropriate o nan the late of commencement of the Order which was the original suggestion. In Article 17 provision is made for the transfer of any criminal case pending before a District Court in the Trucial States to be transferred, if desirable, to a District Court in c a tar,. Bahrein, Kuwait cr ruscat and Oman.^ It is for consideration whether this facility should be extended to civil cases. There is perhaps, from the point of view of the parties to the case, not so much justification -toi transferring a civil as there is for transferring a criminal case. ./hen uhe draft Trucial States Order has been agreed we would propose to amend the Orders in Council on similar lines. 5. ^ours sincerely, (signed) (a.C.

In consequence of India beoaming independent* the United Kingdoa Government has taken over from the Gov erne*? nt of India responsibility for the British protected statei in the Persian Gulf. In these States His majesty has criminal and civil jurisdiction over British subjects and certain other persons who are not local nationals. This jurisdiction is exercised by British courts established by Order-in- Council under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890. Under Section 7 of the jot and the relevant Article xti the Order*in-Council (sue e.g. Article 20 of the Xanwait ) der-in-Counci l, 1935) the political Resident is authorised to direct that any sentence of imprisonment imposed by such a Court shall be carried into ef eat in place in His Majesty’s dominions, provided the Government thereof consents. In the event of a European or ^uierican being sentenced to imprisonment it might be desirable for the Political Resident to exercise his power under Article 7 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act as there is a lack of suitable prison accommodation for detaining such persons locally. Previously they would probably have been sent to India, but this* as you sill appreciate* would no longer be appro priate. We have, in consultation with the Colonial Office and the Com. onwealth delations Office been considerin other possibilities and y taking into -vccount travel facilities ft*om the Stater concerned,we have come to the concl ision that* if it could be arranged, it would probably be best and most convenient if such persons v/ere sent to the U.JL to serve their sentence. I should be grateful to Know whether this would be possible. The number of persona involved is unlikely to be more than two or three a year, If you think it would be useful to talk about this I shall be pleased to do so.

The Shaikh requested that the*matter should be referred to me for an authoritative decision. 2. The olitical Agent, in turn, asked me to inform him of the future legal set up of the Agency. On ray recent tour to Kuwait, I examined the position and while the number of cases reaching the Political Agent*s court is growing fast, the situation is not such as Justifiably to give the Shaikh an excuse for criticising our legal arrangements. It is, I think, quite possible that the Shaikh*s hesitant attitude over the appointment of a Police Officer is induced by his desire to extend his Jurisdiction 3. I have assumed, and I hope correctly, that there is no possible question of our giving up Jurisdiction over Dominion subjects, and have replied to the Political Agent informing him that he should follow the Kuwait Order-in- Council in his dealings with Indians and Pakistanis. Unless the Shaikh himself raises the matter again I do not propose to give him any reply. ( A.C. Galloway) B.A.B.

We have been coneiderlng with the Commonwealth Relatione Office the Question of aroendniente which it will be necessary to niake to the Persian Gulf Orders-in-Council t&gt;z a result of the Government of the United Kingdom taking over responsibility in the Gulf from the Govermcent of India* Some points have arisen which concern the Colonial Office and we should be grateful if you would give them your consideration. 2. Article 1? of the Trucial States Order-in- Council 1946 and the corresponding Articles in the other Orders provide that: M v;»here a person subject to the Order is accused of the commission of an offence the cognisance whereof appertains to the Court, and it is expedient that the offence be enquired of, tried, determined, and punished in a British Possession, the accused may (under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1090, section 6 ) be sent for trial to Bombay.* The Kind of case in which this provision might be used is v/here a European or American is accused of a serious offence. It would not now be appropriate to send such persons for trial in Bombay and it is proposed, with your agreement, to substitute some British Possession. If you see no objection to this proposal, we should appreciate your advice as V.L. Dale, Esq., Colonial Office. /toto the selection of the place. Various sugreetions have been made* The Political Resident favours Cyprus. Aden and Eairbbi have also been mentioned as the law applicable in the Persian Oulf Statute is largely Indian law. Transport an# corbuuoI cat ions facilities will of course have to be taken into consideration. 3* There is another point ^rising on article 17 and corresponding Articles on which we should like to have your views. It is not clear whether the jurisdiction conferred by Section 6 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act includes jurisdiction for appeals. If it does, an appeal would be dealt with by the aor.aal Court of Appeal for the Posseeaion concerned. If it does not, the Commonwt&amp;lth Relations Office tiiimc that the Order-ia-Council should itself confer jurisdiction on the Court of appeal for the Possession. We, however, a-e inclined to the view that, whatever the correct interpretation of Article 6 , the jurisdiction which it confers c&amp;nnct be extended by 0 rdt i— in-Oounc i 1. Vv© have considered whether jurisdiction could be conferred under Article 9 but we do not think the wording of Article 9 is apt for this purpose. Under Article 6 , if no other court in the Possession specified is authorised to hear cases transferred from a foreign country, the cases are dealt with by the supreme criminal court of the Possession and it may be that /therethere is no appeal from the decislone of such e. court to any other court or judicial authority in the Possession* Perhaps Commonwealth delations Cffice could let ub know what happened about appeals against the decisions of the Supreme Court of Bombay under the existing Orders-in-CouncilV If you consider that something should be said about appeals in the Orders would you pleas© suggest a suitable form of words? 4* One further amendment to these Articles is proposed* namely, tho deletion of the words 'for trial” at the end of tlie first paragraph* This is so that doubt may not be cast on the power of the court to cause the offender not only to be tried but also to be punished within tlie British Possession* 5* One other mattor concerns the Colonial Office. It may not always be convenient to transfer serious criminal cases to a court in a British Possession end it is proposed that a professional judge, e.g. a retired Indian or colonial judge, might be engaged to go to the Persian Gulf to try such casus as and when required. The necessary judicial powers could be conferred on him by appointing him for the time being Judicial assistant to the ^olitic^l Resident* He would then function under Article 1* of the Tracial States Order, and the corresponding Articles of the other Ordeib. however, under those Orders an appeal would be against his decisions to the Chief Court, i.e. the Political Resident, and the Political Resident feels that it would be very embarrassing for him to consider appeals against the decisions of a professional judge. We sympathise with his feelings and indeed as a matter of logic it does aeem true to say that if you appoint somebody having specific judicial qualifications to try cases you ought to provide an appeal to a specific judicial tribunal.

Article 17 of the Trucial Order and the corresponding Articles of the other Orders at present contain a blank. The reference used to be to Bombay and it is now agreed to sub stitute a place in some colonial territory. Of the various possibilities which offer, c c yP r us appears to be the most suitable,’but I should like your confirmation that Cyprus will meet your views. Do you think it is necessary to specify any particular locality in Cyprus; I should have thought not on the whole. — * - 2. The Political Resident, Bahrein, has more than once suggested with reference to Article 20 (ij of the same Order and the corresponding Articles of the other Orders, that the proviso at the end of this paragraph should be omitted. As / F.A.K. Harrison, Ssq. , Commonwealth Relations Office.Aa far as I can see, no one 'objects to this and the Political Resident says that its omission will facilitate the transfer of offenders from one Gulf State to another. If there is any doubt whether the Gulf States or some of them form part of His Majesty 1 s dominions for purposes of tfre Orders,as I suppose there is, this would appear to be true. In any case, I can see no objection to this omission. It could allflUfl? be de cided ad hoc where a particular person should be sent in any given case. Do you agree to the omission of this proviso? 3. I see that the Political Resident also/ * referring to paragraph 3 (c) of your letter to him EXT 1714/47 of September 11th, 1947, says that he sees no objection to the omission of Article 88 (l) of the Trucial Order and the corresponding Articles of the other Orders. I have not seen your letter to which he refers, hut I am quite ready to take it from you that this provision could or should be omitted. The reference is to the Indian Extradition Act of 1903 and of certain Indian Orders in Coucil made in connexion therewith. Would you Confirm that it is desirable to omit this passage? * 4. There is also the question, which you apparently raised in the same letter,of amending the earlier part of Article 20 (l) or the Trucial Order and the corresponding A r ticle in the other Orders, but in Gibson^ letter to me of March 24th last, it is stated that Sir Kenneth Kemp does /■ •Vow. (XS N , does not follow the necessity for this amend ment since the present terms of Article 20 cover the sending of a convicted person to any foreign jurisdiction place. I must say that this seems to me to he right. We are of coarse deleting the reference to Bombay in this provision^and it will now allow a convicted person to be sent 'for imprisonment to any place in His Majesty’s dominions or any foreign jurisdiction place, and all that would be necessary would be to give the appropriate administrative instructions to the Political Resident or to make appropriate arrange ments as to where particular persons should be sent in particular cases. 5. This leaves us with the question which has also been raised by the Political Resident of arranging for a special judge to try important criminals involving Americans and European British subjects. We agree with this in prin ciple, and think the best method cf procedure would be to secure the services of some retired British-Indian or colonial judge who might agree to go out to the Persian Gulf to take oases periodically as and when required. So far as the Orders in Council go, however, no particular difficulty arises in regard to the appointment or functioning of such a judge. He could be appointed as Judicial Assistant within the definition of that term within the various Orders, and would then function under for instance, Article 15 of the Trucial Order and the corresponding Articles of the other Orders. The difficulty arises on the question of appeals from his decision, as the Political Resident has said that he would find /find it embarrassing to deal with such appeals seeing that they might be from the decision of a judge of eminence or of considerable legal attainment* As a matter of*logic it does aeem true to say that if you appoint somebody having specific judicial qualifications to try^cases you ought to provide an appeal to a specific judicial tribunal. One possibility might be to let the matter rest on the basis suggested, though not quite in this connexion, by Sir Kenneth Kemp in a Note attached to Donaldson’s letter to me of May 20th, 1947, where he said that even without any express provision to that effect, parties could always in 'a proper case, apply to the Privy Council for special leave to appeal* The alternative would be to folio?/ the suggestion ' made by Sir Kenneth Kemp cited in Gibson’s letter to me of March 24th last, and make provision in the Orders in Council for appeal to a convenient court in a British possession. * This would have to be Cyprus I think, and the idea would be presumably that we would add a passage to A tide 36 of the Trucial Order and the corresponding Article in the other Orders, empowering the . Chief Court, if'it thought fit, to transmit the appeal for hearing and decision to a specified court in a British possession. On the whole I should have thought that this would be the most satisfactory course, and quite appro priate if we are going to get an ex-Indian or colonial judge to take this type of case. I think, however, that we should have to specify the actual court to which the appeal was to be made and if you agree with this course, perhps you could ascertain and let me know the exact designation of the Highest Court /If I oould hear from you on these points we could then get the five Orders issued as soon as there is a Council*&amp; Ext. 57 V l &gt;8 I July, 1948 , A »_ H ■cLmw*».c/'C.

We are now concerned in this question only from the points of view of the Governments of India and Pakistan. Tou will remember that we agreed to the immediate issue of the revised Orders without consultation with the Governments of India and Pakistan on the understanding that those Governments should subsequently be given copies of the revised Orders and asked if they had any points to which they wished to call attention which would be carefully considered and if necessary embodied in amending Orders. In these circumstances we hope that it will be possible for the Orders to be issued without too much delay and should be very grateful to know how the matter now stands.

A few additional amendments of a formal nature have been made in the Bahrain Order-in-Council. 2. With reference to paragraph 3(a) ©f your letter I consider it necessary to retain an article in all the Orders-in-Council to enable an offence to be tried outside the Gulf State in which it is ^ -committed. Amongst other things if a Eurepean British or American subject is accused ©f a serious criminal offence it may be most desirable to arrange for the offence to be tried in the United Kingdom or elsewhere where proper arrangements can be made for his detention and where he can obtain proper legal advice. Apart from this circumstances may easily arise making it necessary for an offender to be transferred for trial from one Gulf State to another. I attach a copy of a suggested redraft of Article 17 of the Trucial States Order-in-C©uncil and the corresponding articles in the other Orders-in-Council. I have included in it the reference to the Foreign Jurisdiction Act 1890 which appears in the present article. If this reference is considered necessary - and I am not certain of the reason for it - then it would appear that the Foreign Jurisdict ion Act 1890 should be included in the enactments listed in Article 12(1) of the Trucial States Order-in-Council and the corresponding articles of the other Orders-in-Council in order that for the purpose of the Act the Gulf States may be regarded as British possessions. I would note that at present offenders from the Trucial States can be tried at Bahrain by virtue of the definition of 'Political Agency' in Article 4 of the Order-in-Council but that this will not continue t© be the case when a separate Political Agent is appointed for the Trucial Coast. 3. With reference to paragraph 3(b) of your letter it is not known yet whether the Bahrain Government will accept convicts from the Trucial States but I would suggest in any case that the proviso at the end ©f Article 20(1) be omitted both in the Trucial States Order-in-Council and in the corresponding articles of the other Orders-in-Council to facilitate the transfer of offenders from one Gulf State to another whenever this appears desirable. The reason for the inclusion of the proviso in the existing Orders-in-Council is not known t© me. 4. With reference to paragraph 3(c) of your letter I see no objection to the omission of Article 88(1) of the Trucial States Order-in-Council and the corresponding articles in the other Orders-in-Council. /5. With reference...- page ft - €) Vjo ^' ,v ^f'f 1 r *f®rence to paragraph 4 of yeur letter generally speaking the amendments we are making in the Orders-in-Council are only formal and make little change in the existing position.

In particular the Pakistan Govern- raent might perhaps be told that the amendments involve no change in the functions of the Indian Assistant at Bahrain who will continue to tryj^M* eases in which Indians are involved c.f. correspondence ending with my Express better No.211-S dated 23rd January. 1942 . I would call attention to the fact that if ArtlcieTl^and~^CrQl~- ^2 e + .^ ruc f? 1 Order-in-C©uncil and the corresponding articles of the other Orders-in-Council are revised in the manner proposed it will still be possible to send Indian and Pakistani subjects to India and Pakistan for trial or imprisonment for so long as those two countries remain within the Commonwealth. 6. I would note that as there is a post office at Dubai the Indian Post Offices Act 1895 has been added t© the Schedule to the Trucial States Order-in-Council. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant 1 LB ’ Political Resident, Persian i}ulf.Where a persen subject t© the Order is accused ©f the % commission of an offence the cognisance of which appertains to the Court and it is expedient that the offence be enquired ©f tried determined and punished ©utside the limits of the Order the accused may (under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act 1890 Section 6) be sent for trial to the United Kingdom or any other place in His Majesty's dominions the Government whereof consents to acceptsthe offender for trial or a place in which by treaty, grant, usage, sufferance or other lawful means His Majesty's Government has jurisdiction. The Chief Court may where it appears so expedient by warrant under the hand and seal of the Political Resident cause the accused t© be sent for trial outside the limits of the order accordingly. The warrant shall be sufficient authority to any person to whom it is directed to receive and retain the person therein named and t© carry him to and deliver him up at the place specified in the warrant.

During Caccia's visit here we discussed the desirability •f making arrangements for a special judge to be sent ©ut from England to try important criminal cases in which British European or American subjects might be involved and I enclose a copy of a note I wrote on this and kindred subjects. 3. There would be no difficulty whatever so far as the Orders-in-Council are concerned in arranging for a judge from the United Kingdom to try cases in the Gulf States. He would be appointed for the time being Judicial Assistant to the Political Resident.vide definition of Judicial Assistant in paragraph 4 of the Trucial States Order-in-Council and would have the powers of a Sessions Judge under the Indian Code ®f Criminal Procedure vide Article 1 of the same Order. The ©nly difficulty that would arise would be the disposal ©f appeals against any orders that he might pass. The Political Resident might be able t© deal with any ad interim references to the High Court but would I am certain feel most embarrassed if he found himself compelled to decide an appeal against an order passed by an experienced judge from the United Kingdom. It is for consideration therefore whether some provision ought not to be made in the Orders-in- Council to enable the Political Resident to refer to a court in the United Kingdom any appeal which he does not feel himself competent to decide or which he may be directed by the Secretary of State to transfer. I have touched on this point in my n©te t© Caccia but in connection with civil cases only. 4. You will see from my note that at the time I wrote I was against the appointement ©f judges from England and I still am opposed t© the holding of any regular session in these parts by an English judge. I do think h©wever that cases may arise iti which it will be desirable to obtain the services of a judge from England. The trial of offenders in the United Kingdom which it is proposed to provide for in the Orders-in-Council will be a most expensive procedure as it will probably involve the despatch to the United Kingdom by air not ©nly of offenders but of a large number of witnesses both prosecution and defence. .U K.

Important criminal cases involving American or British European subjects do not often arise but when they do have to be dealt with as speedily as possible owing to the daffinulty of keeping such persons in detention in the Gulf States and considerable delay (not to mention expense) would be involved if a judge were to be got out from England on each occasion. I consider therefore that this course should only be adopted in exceptional circumstances. Special provisions would have to be made regarding the appoint ment and powers of such a judge in the various Orders-in-Go unci 1 though this might not present great difficulty. A possible alternative is to arrange for an appeal to lie to a court in the United Kingdom instead of to the Political Resident in criminal cases in which Europeans or Americans are involved. The Political Resident at present exercises the powers of a Judge of the High Court in dealing with death sentences (which are in any case subject to confirmation by the Secretary of State) and appeals. I have held office as Political Resident for a total of about 2^ years and during this time have dealt with no death sentences and only two or three appeals. It is probable however that with the presence of the Political Resident in Bahrain appeals to him will tend to increase. He is hand?capped in dealing with appeals in having nobody to dentil his cases for him and search for rulings. The cases however with which the Political Resident has to deal are so few and up to date of such small importance that I doubt if any change in the existing arrangements is necessary. I do think however that if he were confronted with a civil appeal involving substantial property and complicated legal issues it might be necessary for him to ask for the appointment of a special judge to try it. I would readily welcome a short visit from a judicial expert to examine the existing system and recommend what steps if any are necessary for its in^rovement. jJo -' iX ^ xAT THE COURT AT BUCKINGHAM PALACE The gth day of March, 1939 Present THE KING'S MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY IN COUNCIL Whereas by Treaty, capitulation, grant, usage, sufferance, and other lawful means His Majesty the King has jurisdiction within the territories of the Sheikh of _Qa tar: j and whereas provision was made for the exercise ofj such jurisdiction by the Qatar Order in Council L939 I'sSa} and whereas it is expedient to repeal the said Order in Council and make further provision for the exercise of the said jurisdiction; Ti xuc ^ccrar wruer m council, 193^, is hereby repealed and this Order may be cited as “ The Qatar Order in Council, 2.
