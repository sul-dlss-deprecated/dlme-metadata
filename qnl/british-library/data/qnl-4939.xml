FOEEIGN AND POLITICAL DEPAETMENT SECRET. r o External. i t* * * v ' To The Eight Honourable AUSTEN CHAMBEELAIN, Mis Majesty's Secretary of State for India, Simla, the 23rd July 1915, Sir, We have the honour to forward a copy of a letter * from the Director of the Eoyal Indian Marine, in which he * No. 23 o 9 , dated the 10 th May 191 . proposes the conversion of the existing acetylene gas buoys in the Persian Gulf to the 'Aga” system of buoy lighting. 2. In the circumstances explained by the Director, and considering the advantages and saving which would ultimately result, we recommend that the “ Aga” system of buoy lighting be adopted. We have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servants,No. 2359, dated Bombay, the 10th May 1915. Prom—The Director of the Royal Indian Marine, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Marine Department. I have the honour to recommend, for the favourable consideration of the Government of India, that the 8 acetylene gas buoys at present existing in the Persian Gulf be converted to the “ Aga ” system of buoy lighting, which has been reported to be more economical and at the same time more° advant ageous, as regards reliability, facility of recharging, &amp;c., than the present system of lighting the Gulf by automatic acetylene gas buoys. The “Aga” system has been adopted for several important Marine lighting undertakings durino* the past few years including the Panama Canal, and has also been installed in the Hooghly river. The Deputy Conservator of the Port, Calcutta, whom I consulted in the matter, speaks very favourably of the system, and reports that it has worked successfully in the Hooghly. 2 . The chief points which recommend the adoption of the “ Aga ” system are— (i) The risk of accidents to those who have the recharging of buoys using carbide in bulk is eliminated. (ii) Reduction in working expenses. (Hi) Reliability of the light for long-periods. With regard to (i), there was a serious accident recently on board the {{ Lawrence ” while charging one of the buoys in the Persian Gulf with the existing arrangements. With dissolved acetylene, which is used in the t{ Aga ; ’ system, such an accident would be impossible. As regards (ii), the estimated cost of carbide for charging one buoy for one year including the purifier is £28, whilst the cost of recharging the “ Aga ” gas accumulators for one buoy is estimated at £5, exclusive of freight from Bombay to the Gulf. The annual saving in this connection on the 8 buoys would therefore be £184* approximately in addition to an appreciable saving in labour. In addition to this a considerable saving would be effected in fuel consumed by the Light House Tender, as the vessel will have to recharge the “Aga” system buoys every 12 months, instead of every 7 months as at present. A working demonstration of the “ Aga” system was witnessed last year by the Assistant Director, Royal Indian Marine, the Chief Constructor and the Inspector of Machinery of this Dockyard, who report that it was satisfactory. 3. The estimated cost of converting the present 8 acetylene gas buoys to the “ Aga ” system not including cost of structural alterations to the buoys (which is estimated at £240 by the Gas Accumulator Company, the manufacturers of the £&lt; Aga ” system) amounts to £1,327 including spare accumulators fully charged for 4 buoys—excluding freight from London to Bombay or the Gulf. The additional estimated cost, £240 of structural alterations, could be considerably reduced if the work is carried out either by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (who have agreed to carry out any repairs, &amp;c., to the buoys) or by mechanics sent to the Gulf from this Dockyard ; this I propose to do should the Government of India be pleased to approve of the adoption of the system as recommended by me.1915 .

Harvey. Sir, I have the hohour to report that on visiting the Outer Anchorage Gas Buoy at 9-30 p.m. yesterday, the light was observed to be burning very dimly and when inspected it was found that a very hard and brittle deposit of slag or clinher substance had settled on the burner tips, in a conical form, and to a height of from one to one and a half inches; that the burner tips and one pilot tip were smoking and the inner surfaces of the lantern were found to be covered with a light coat of soot. The occulting mechanism is apparently in proper working order as the light, such as it was, was occulting. The deposit was removed from the burner tips and a very con siderable improvement in the light was observed but it was not giving its full power consequently, a spare burner cluster was substituted at 6-0 this morning. The Inner Anchorage buoy was visited at 8-45 this morning and found to be quite clean and in thorough working order; this buoy was lit about the same time as the other and nas given no trouble. In my opinion, the deposit on the burner tips may oe due to the purifier in the purifier chamber being loosu-i-y pa cue a and consequently the fine powder was carried through the gas passages to the burner tips where it melted, settleu and gradually accumulated. The purifier chambers for all the gas buoys were sent by the Makers packed or filled and ready for instant use. II would suggest that the International Ltd Ottawa, Canada, he communicated with on this subject, to obviate a recurrence enable us to guard against it in future. I have etc. (sd) T.G.J.Harvey.

Dear Sir, t , ^ i * , I am sorry if there has been any misunderstanding as to the Acetylene Buoys for the Persian Gulfjthe facts of the case are as follows, viz:- The counterweights were only discovered to be insuffi cient on inspection at Manchester by the Trinity House Engineer of the third Buoy indented for through this House, and immediate arrangements were made for the preparation and delivery by the Contractors of heavier counterweights for this Buoy and two other Buoys. The discovery of insufficient counterweights on the first three Buoys was made in time to have new and heavier counterweights fitted to Hos. 4 and 5 Buoy* beforebefore they left Canada as, although stated in the letter from this House of 23rd July, B. 1873/1912, that Nos. 4 and 5 were on their way from Canada, it was subsequently ascertained that they had missed the Ship. The whole matter is now in order, and the only item remaining^as regards the Buoys is the three spare sets of moorings which are ready for shipment as advised in my official letter to y-ya. of to-day f s date. ¥€^ur'&amp;-truiy, fc-Sr -Shuokburgh hftdra-' Of-free, W. /J u) J Hvy~zA~ H e. yJlsudr str, I cm nuoh obliged to you for your dm,i-Official Utter of tha 2nd instant about th&amp; Persian Gulf buoys. I am sorry to harm to trouble you, but there is still a point about which V'e are not quite clear. In your official letter No.B 1872 of 22 July 1912 you told us that all five Aoety lens ; buoys had been furnished ivith counterweights of insufficient weight, and that fresh counterweights were accordingly being despat chad from, Canada. The position at the time you wrote was that buoys Pos e 1 and 2 had already been shipped to the Gulf, No.2 tvas in England (Waiting ship ment and Nos.4 and 5 had already left Canada for this country. In your official letter L of 4 October 1912 you told us that new counter weights for the first three buoys had hem received from Canada and ashed us to arrange for their shipment to the G ulf. Meanwhile, the 4th and Nth buoys had arrived in this country and imre shipped to the Gulf on the 1st September. Poes your present letter mean that these two buoys mre fitted viith the new counter— weights in England before being passed for shipment the Gulf? I tafae it the change cannot hme been effected by the manufacturers in Canada as the buoys appear from your letter of 22 July to have left that country before -th&amp; new ooimtervwtghts.

With reterence to your letters of 27th ultimo (P. 666 ) and 2nd and 14th instant (P. 642 and 956), relative to the lighting of the Persian Gulf, and forwarding a statement of the lights and buoys proposed to be established, also requesting certain further information in regard to the establishment of a depot and the provision of a tender, I am 'directed to acquaint you that the Eldei Liethren have given the whole matter their careful consideration, and now direct me to submit the following observations for the information ol the Secretary of State for India, pointing out that the characters of the various lights and lighted buoys have been selected with a view to their ultimately forming part of the larger scheme proposed in 1909. Lighthouses. 2. The list accompanying the India Office letter dated the 2nd instant provides for the establishment of three lighthouses, viz., at Little Quoin, Tamb Island, and Sheikh Shuaib Island, and the proposals relative to these are as follows :—- At Little Quoin, the dioptric apparatus to be of the second order, the intensity of the light being 200,000 candles, and the range of visibility 20 miles. At Tamb Island, the dioptric apparatus to be of the third order, the intensity of the light being 100,000 candles, and the range of visibility 20 miles. At Sheikh Shuaib Island, the dioptric apparatus to be of the third order, the intensity of the light being 100,000 candles, and the range of visibility 17 miles. The Elder Brethren suggest that the lighthouses for Little Quoin, Tamb Island, and Sheikh Shuaib Island be constructed of open iron frame work, the upper portion being enclosed to act as a service or watch-room. The structure to be surmounted by a lantern of the usual type adopted in the Trinity blouse service. The lighthouses to be constructed in England from designs to be prepared at this House, the lantern, dioptric apparatus, burners, &amp;c., being fitted and tested before shipment. 3. It is suggested that the foundations for receiving the structures should be designed and constructed by the local authorities, the ^ necessary information in connection therewith being supplied by the Trinity House, also that the quarters for the keepers, landing places, roads, access from landings to sites, water storage tanks, &amp;c., be designed and constructed by the local authorities, who are best acquainted with the nature of the requirements. 4. The Elder Brethren propose that a competent mechanic be sent from England to the Persian Gulf to take charge of the erection of the towers from the foundation level and bring the lights into action, all necessaiy assistance, plant, labour, hoisting tackle, &amp;c., being supplied by the local authorities. 5. The cost of the work to be supplied from England, including fi eight to the Persian Gulf, is estimated to be as follows : Little Quoin, 7,000b Tamb Island, 5,000L Sheikh Shuaib Island, 6,000b l including mechanic from England for erection of same. 5 Light Vessel. 6 . With reference to the establishment of a light vessel at Shatt-al-Arab, four or five miles to seaward of the existing British outer bai buoy, T e er Brethren now suggest that the light be on the incandescent system,consuming oil, instead of the illuminant being oil-gas as originally proposed. It is recommended that the vessel be built in England, and when completed placed on a station for trial and adjustment before being despatched to the Gulf, to which she could be towed by the lighthouse tender which it is proposed to construct. The cost of the vessel is estimated at 9,500L, including delivery to its destination, but the Elder Brethren desire to point out that this figure is liable to variation in consequence of the frequent and considerable changes which take place in the cost of shipbuilding. The intensity of the light would be 40,000 candles, and the range of visibility eleven miles. Buoys, Lighted. 7. Either oil gas or acetylene would be suitable illuminants for the pro posed lighted buoys, but in view of the fact that the number of buoys required at stations is only six, the expenditure which would be involved in establishing oil-gas producing plant, and fitting the lighthouse tender with transport receivers, gas compressing pumps. &amp;c., would, in the opinion of the Elder Brethren, hardly be justified, and they accordingly recommend that the six buoys be of the same type as the acetylene lighted buoy already established at Shatt-al-Arab, which was constructed by the Inter national Marine Signal Company, and is known as No. 8 C. * The buoys complete, with lanterns and moorings, should be supplied from England, the estimated cost, including freight to the Gulf, being 600/, each. Two buoys of this type are ready, and arrangements have been made with the manu facturers to hold these at the disposal of the Elder Brethren for a few days, and on hearing that the India Office wish them to be supplied they could be despatched at once. The remainder could probably be completed in ten to twelve weeks from date of order. Buoys, Unlit. Three b 1.103 s of this t} pe are included m the list, with top-marks and moorings complete, viz. :— Jask - - - _ 5 ^ c l ass conical buoy. Bunder Abbas - - iffid class can buoy. Bahrein - - - _ 5 th class conical buoy. In regard to this pioposal I am to state that the Elder Brethren are of opinion that a 5th class buo\ r is too small for a position of the importance of Jask, and they consider that a 2nd class buo } 7 would be more suitable which would increase the cost of this part of the scheme by 100 /, It is suggested that the buoj's and moorings complete should be supplied from England, then cost including freight to the Gulf would be as follows:—Jask (2nd class) 200/., Bunder Abbas 200/., Bahrein 100 /. Light!louse Tender. 9. In the third paragraph of the India Office letter, dated the 2nd March, t e hope is expressed by Lord (Jrewe that a reduction may be made in the original estimate of the cost of the lighthouse tender, viz., 30,000/ Accom panying the papers, however, is a letter from the Secretary to the Government of India, dated the 31st January last, stating the approximate intensions to which the Royal Indian Marine Committee desire the vessel to be built. The estimate of 30,000/. is based on the cost of steam vessels constructed ioi the Innity House service. There are certain parts in connection with these vessels which would not be necessary in a tender for the Persian Gulf whilst, on the other hand, the latter might require various fittings for the convenience of the officers and crew which are not necessaiy in this service. Ihe sum above mentioned is considered a reasonable estimate for such a3 a tendbi &lt;i» would be requisite for the duty required, but to supply a vessel to comply with the dimensions given by the Secretary to the Government of India m the letter referred to above would cost considerably more. ” . Iu 7 iew , .' t ' recenfc developments in respect of the use of oil fuel and internal combustion engines, it may possibly be desired to consider both these features before definitely deciding on the type of vessel to be supplied. Depot. 10. It is observed that it is now proposed that the depot should be on the property the Anglo-Persian Oil Company on Abadan Island, in the river Euphrates instead of at Koweit, as originally suggested. It appears to the Eldei Brethren that this is a matter that the local authorities are better able to decide, it being a question so materially affected by local conditions and facilities; the latter proposal offers the important facility of easily procuring fieSii watei ioi lighthouse purposes, thus rendering a distilling plant, as suggested by the Committee of Enquiry, unnecessary. The modified scheme of lights adopted by the Government of India as compared with the more comprehensive one proposed by the Committee of Enquiry (but which it may be intended eventually to carry out), naturally influences the area of land to be obtained and the form of * construction of the buildings, but the Elder Brethren recommend that il possible not less than two acres be secured as a site for the depot which would admit of future developments of the establishment. 11. In paragraph 4 of the India Office letter of the 2nd instant, inquiry is made as to the possibility of substantially reducing the estimated cost of the depot, viz., 22,000h This estimate included 9,500L for a spare Light Vessel, and the cost of the essential general spares for the buoys, &amp;c., as mentioned in the statement submitted with this report. The scheme put forward by the Committee of Enquiry included several Light Vessels, in which case a spare ship was, of course, necessary, hut as it is understood not to be the practice in India to provide a spare for a single station, the spare vessel might, for the present at least, be dispensed with, and a corresponding saving in cost effected. 12. The Elder Brethren are unaware as to the intentions of the Government of India in regard to the housing of their officers, crew, and workmen at the depot. The authorities in India will themselves be able to prepare estimates to suit their requirements in that respect; but it is considered that, provided no pier work or wharling is necessary, the requisite storage for lighthouse oil, steam coal, carbide, and general stores, workshop, buoy yard, chain lockers, &amp;c., all of which should be made of iron framing covered by corrugated sheeting, could be established and equipped with the necessary spare acetylene and unlit buoys, spare moorings for Light Vessel and buoys, rails, cranes, and trolleys, for a. sum well within the balance of 12,500L, and that, as the lighthouse service in the Gulf increased, the depot accommo dation could be increased to meet the additional requirements. 13. It would be necessary to send from England for the depot the spare buoys, moorings, and 10-ton travelling crane. All corrugated iron buildings, rails, hand cranes, trolleys, workshop equipment, &amp;c., could, it is understood, be obtained at Bombay. 14. With regard to the elate for completion, bearing in mind that the various works to be supplied from England w'ould he undertaken by various contractors, the whole of the buoys could be shipped in four months, and the three lighthouses and the Light Vessel in nine months from the date of order. 15. A statement is forwarded herewith showing the works it is suggested should be supplied from this country, with estimated cost and other particulars. s. 146. A 2— 16. As the work is understood to be urgent, much progress could be made at once by the local authorities in the preparation of the concrete foun dations of the towers, construction of the landing places, keepers’ dwellings, roads, &amp;c., during which time the iron towers could be under construction in England. 17. In this connection 1 am to state that the Elder Brethren have at the present time under construction for the Colonial Office an iron tower and third order single flashing light which would be suitable for Tamb Island, and if the matter is very urgent the Elder Brethren would be disposed, if the Marquess of Crewe considers it desirable, to approach the Colonial Office on the subject with a view to the tower and apparatus referred to being utilised for Tamb Island, and the Colonial Office work delayed to some extent. If this were done the material for Tamb Island could be shipped in August. 18. The drawings of the concrete foundations for the three towers will be ready for despatch to the India Office in time for next week’s mail to India. lb. The time for the manufacture of the work for all the lights is based on the ordinary routine of business; but, should the India Office require quicker delivery, no doubt this would be possible if a premium were paid to the various contractors. 20. If it is still desired to hold a Conference on the subject of acquiring a site on Abadan Island for a lighthouse depot, the Elder Brethren will be glad to arrange for a member ol this Board, together with their Engineer-in- Chief and Mr. blood, to attend.

He points out that it Is not practicable as a rule to recharge the bucys in situ. owing to the exposed position of most of them, and owing to the exceptional climatic cen- -dltions prevailing in the Golf.

Sir, With reference to your recent complaint regarding the counter- weignts on the 8C buo t ys for the Persian Gulf, we are just in receipt of a cshle from our Head Of lice in whi ch they tell us that upon invest igating the matter tnoroughly they are afraid that the counterweights on the five buoys despatched are not as they should be as regards weight, and that as a result the Engineer who was responsible for the proper carrying out of the work in the Shop is not now in the service of our Company. They are despatching this week new counterweights which will in every way, we believe, meet with your approval, and we have to request that in the meantime you kindly cable to the Persian Authorities to the effect that if it is absolutely essential that the buoyd be placed in the water immediately , and it is found that the counter weights are too light, they add to the weight by wiapping around the Tube 1000 lbs of chain. The better plan, of course, would be to await the arrival of the new counterweights, but if this cannot be done it will be found that adding the necessary weight by chain will be absolutely satisfactory. The expense incurred by the Authorities in this connection will, of course,be refunded by us. It is natrually most annoying to the General Manager of this Company and to the writer that a mistake ofthis kind should occur, as both at this end and at Ottawa the instructions were most explicit, and every care was exercised by the management to see that the work was in every way satisfactory. The Inspectors chosen werewere those considered by the Company to be well qualified, and it is a matter of great regret that there should be any cause for complaint.
