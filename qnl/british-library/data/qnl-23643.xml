With reference to Hr.Nair's letter No.18753-3 dated the 12th September 1935, I am directed to state that the rule published in the Notification No.i-6(26)- H.11/35 dated the 11th July 1935, delegates power to permit deviations only from provisions of a purely procedural nature, like, for instanc , those contained in I art X of the Civil Service Regulations. In other ^ordCs, it delegates power to permit deviations from such provisions as are so unimportant that they cannot be regarded as fforming part of the conditions of service, and ought not to have formed part of the statutory rules or of those which have received statu tory confirmation under section 96B of the Government of India Act. The procedure laia down in rule 55 of the Civil Services (Classifioation, Control and Appeal) Bules definitely constitutes a condition of service, and is, as such, clearly outside the scope of the rule referred to. 2, A copy of the correspondence which led to the issue of the rule in question is enclosed, as desired.FINANCE DEPARTMENT.

Under the Note below rule 4 of the old commutation procedure rules promulgated with the resolution of the Government of India, Finance De partment. No. F. 2-XIV-R. 11/1928, dated the 26th June 1928, when an application for commutation of pension was made by a pensioner drawing his pension in India, after the pension had been sanctioned, the report on the application was made by the Audit or Accounts Officer who paid the pension. That Note was amended in the resolutions of the Government of India, Finance Department No. D. 226-R. II, dated the 5th February 1930 and No. D./2263-R. 11/30, dated the 8th September 1930. The necessity for amending the Note arose from the fact that the Accounts Officer in re porting on the application for commutation was required to furnish inform ation regarding the availability of funds. This information could be given only by the Accounts Officer in whose books the pensionary charge was adjustable. Under the revised commutation procedure rules now in force, in cases in which the charge falls partly on the Provincial Government which has stipulated that it should be consulted regarding the availability of funds, the authority competent to sanction commutation is required to obtain the consent of that Government before according administrative sanction. The Accounts Officer is no longer concerned with the question of the availability of funds and the particulars now required by him for reporting on an application for commutation are the age of the pensioner and the incidence of pension. The Accounts Officer of the Province in which is situated the treasury from which the pensioner draws his pension has the necessary par- ticulars in his office and is in the best position to report on the application. In the circumstances, the necessity for the retention of the Note under rule 1 (2) (a) of the Commutation procedure rules does not exist and the Gov ernor General in Council is pleased to decide that it shall be deleted.

The ..udit Officers vver^ e.skad in that leteer to r-v report without delay such cases 'bo the Controller of the Currency. But as that office has since been abolished it has been decided that, so far as the Central Gov•..rnnKnt are concerned, the Finane^ Department 'will the appropriate authority to whom all such r ports should in fuoure bo made. 2. On th^ introduction of Provincial Autonomy direct relations have been established between the Reserve Bank anc ehe Fi ovincial Governments. It se jus appropriate therefore that Provincial Governments should now deal with CciS.s T losses a fectinr them. The responsibility of the Hes-rve Bank in regard, to banking business, etc., at its offices, branches r agencies vis-e^vis Provincial Governments is that of a banker to an ordinary customer. As such the proper authority - go deal with reports of losses in vfhich uh.r., ib a possibility of the Bank b;ing made liable Sedus to be the F:.na ..Ce Department of the Provincial Gov^rreuent cone ..rn^d. It appears desirable to issue instructions to audit officers to report cases of losses of this type to the Finance D.partm~nt of ehe Provincial Government concerned. Before, howeVei, such instructions are issued this Department may kindly be informed if the Provincial Government have any objection to this proposal.Copy of letter No. 114-Adinn. 1/143-37, dated the 18th February 1938, from the Auditor General of India, to all Provincirl Accountants General and Comptrollers.

Subject:— Amendment of certain Articles of the Civil Service Regulations. I am directed to refer to the correspondence ending with the India Office letter No. F. 1415/ 37, dated the 10th June 1937, conveying the orders of the Secretary of State in regard to the revision of those Articles of the Civil Service Regulations which relate to compensation pen sion, and to say that there is a reference to Article 427 in Article 453. As the former Article has been deleted, it is necessary either to delete the latter also or to amend it suitably so as to make it self contained. Article 453 like Article 427 is an executive exhortation and is therefore, out of place in a body of service rules. Accordingly the Government of India consider that it should be deleted. I am to request that if this view is accepted, the Secretary of State may be moved to pass a Resolution making the enclosed amendment. 2. Two other amendments of a minor nature are necessary in Articles 447(b) and 448(b), con sequent on the deletion of Articles 42/ and 458. Opportunity has been taken to include them in the draft amendment referred to in paragraph 1 above. % 3. The Governor General in Council proposes to issue in due course similar amendments for services under his rule making control and to invite Provincial Governments to follow suit. Draft Amendments to the Civil Service Regu lations. In the said Regulations— 1. In clause (b) of Article 447 the words and figures 'The principle of Article 427 must always be carefully borne in mind' shall be omitted. 2. In clause (b) of Article 448, for the words, figures, bracket and letter 'Articles 447(b) and 453', the word, figures, bracket and letter 'Article 447(b)' shall be substituted. 3. Article 453 shall be omitted.o0py of letter No. F. 6102/37, dated the 18th January 1938, from the India Office, Finan cial Department, London, to the Govern ment of India, Finance Department. Subject:— Amendment of Articles 427, 447 and 448, Civil Service Regulations. In reply to your letter of the 2nd December, 1937, No. F. 14(1)-B. 11/36, I am directed by the Secretary of State to say that it seems un likely that a case will even arise in which the provisions of Article 447(b) would be applied to an officer under the rule-making control of the Secretary of State. I am therefore to suggest that when the general revision of the Civil Ser vice Eegulations is undertaken this Article and also Article 448, which does not apply to officers under the rule-making control of the Secretary of State, should be omitted. If this suggestion is adopted it does not seem worth while making the amendments proposed by the Government •of India in anticipation of the general revision. but if the Government of India or any Provin cial Government wish to make them there is no objection to their doing so. The Secretary of State agrees that Article 453, Civil Service Regulations should be deleted and a copy of the necessary Resolution is enclosed herewith. F. 6102/37. RESOLUTION. In exercise of the powers conferred by sub section (1) of Section 247 of the Government of India Act, 1935, the Secretary, of State hereby makes the following amendment in the Civil Service Regulations and directs that the amend ment shall have effect from the 17th January, 1938.

A c. opy.....■ ■ .Copy of letter No.F.4(9)R-I/37, dated the 13th October 1937, from the Joint Secretary to the Government of India, Finance Department, to His Majesty's Under Secretary of State for India, India Office, London. Subject:- Date of effect of interpretation of the words the date on which the appointment is made' in Rule 1A(^) of the Superior Civil Services Rules. With reference to the correspondence ending with your letter No.S.&amp;G. 7426/36, dated the 6th January 1937, addressed to the Home Department, I am directed to say that the question as to the date from which the new interpretation conveyed therein of the words 'the date on which the appointment is made' should have effect, has recently been under the consideration of the Government of India. They are of opinion that the principle contained in Article 157(a) of Audit Code, Vol. I, should govern the present case. According to that principle, when a wrong interpretation of a financial rule has been followed with the result that erroneous payments have been admitted in audit for a considerable time, the new correct interpretation should, in the absence of special instructions to the contrary, take effect from the date of issue, by competent authority, of the orders stating the correct interpretation. If this principle is applied, the new interpretation of the words quoted above should have effect from the 6th January 1937. ' 2. This view derives further support from the fact that a somewhat complex and 'unfair position would result if the new interpretation were applied with retrospective effect and not from the 6th January 1937. Taking the question only of passages, retrospective effect would mean that the dates of appointment already entered in the existing passages accounts of officers and their families will have to be revised in conformity with that inter pretation and that credits in those accounts will have to be increased or decreased, as the case might be, with referencerofcronco 'to t/hc rovisod. datos. Such a revision v/ould afford causo for griovancc to ihosc officers whose balance in their passage accounts would he reduced retrospectively as a result of the new interpretation. 3. The Government of India have, therefore, come to the conclusion, in agreement with the Auditor General, that the simplest and the most equitahle course would he to date the new interpretation from the 6th January - 1937. This would mean that any date of appointment already recorded before the 6th January 193 7 would remain undisturbed and conseQuently that in the cas^ o± officers of the Indian Folice referred to in the leot^r of the Home Department, No.101/F.7/33/36-Ests., dated the 26th November 1936, the dates of appointment already placed on record would hold good. 4.

The case of Lieut.-Colonel E.T.R.wickham hc.b c .iven rise to the question whether lalitary officers in civil employment granted long leave preparatory to retirement should be allowed to count the whole of such leave as servias lor pension. These officers seem, as regards counting leave as service for pension, to he much more generously treated than either members of the civil ser vices in India or military officers in military employment. The former are allowed to count leave preparatory to retirement for pension only within the limits laid down in Article 408 Ci»3.H 0 while the latter, although they count all leave as service for pension, are not allowed to take more than one year's leave pending retirement. The military officer in civil employment, however, may be granted as much as two years and four months leave pending retirement and is, at present, allowed to count all of it as service for pension. Cur prima facie view is that in such cases only one year should be allowed to count but we should be glad of the opinion of the Govt, of India on the point. If the Govt, of India think that the restriction is one which might be imposed they will* no doubt submit for the Secretary of State's approval the necessary amendment to the Pension Regulations for the Ar;:iy in India.-3- , . ,SoPY of an Air .ail letter No.B.41566/l/A .G .14,. aatec. 5 ,11.1937, from the oecretary to the Govt., of , Deience Deptt., Ne\.

It is, hoi.evar, suggested that the proposed restriction sl.ould only afxect those military officers who take u: civil employment on or after the date on which the rule comes into force, as it is not considered fair that the c::' ^itions of service of military officers a.t present in civil employment should be adversely affected. As regards the necessary amendments to Pension Regulations. India, consequent on the above decision, it is now the practice to amend basic regulations biannually* Amendments of general application which are considered to be of sufficient importance to v/arraxit publication in advance are however published in the form of Array Instructions (India) prior to insertion in /the relevant Hegulations.

In continuation of this Office letter No.6.102.1.9^ dated the 15th September 1936, on the above-mentioned subject, I sm directed to inform you that when the scheme was i irst introduced, appointees eligible to becone volunt ry contri butors were called upon to sign their agreements sane days prior to the date of their embarkation for India, or Burma. The documents were subsequently dated by this Office, the date entered being the day prior to that on which the appointee embarked, and this was regarded as the date of execution of the agreement. It was discovered however, that this procedure was legally unsound, for in the case of a certain candidate recruited by the India Office the officer successfully contended that he was entitled to pay from the date on which he signed the documents. Following this instructions were issued to every appointee to append his, or her, signature to the documents actually on the day prior to that of departure from this country, but this method was also found to be open to objection, p.s it was not possible to ensure that the candidate signed the agreement before sailing and further some delay was inevitable in the completion of the documents, with the result that in many cases the authorities in India and Burma did.. •did not receive their coiDies of the documents until some time 'ftcr the ^rrivr.l of the officer r.t his &amp;or.ticn• xhC matter T '^s therefore investigated in consult-.tion ^ith the L^gr.l Adviser of the India Office r.nd the Ministry of Eerlth r.nd it was agreed that the best solution v /as to provide in the text of the agreement on^.t the appointee should enter the sirvice on 'the day preceding the date of his embarkation for India (or Burnv-.)' and not, as originally approved, 'on the date of the execution of this agreement'. I rm therefore to ask that the Government of India may kindly be moved to ccord their Sc.ncoj.on oo the amendment of the model agreement lorm accordingly -.ncl to communicate this reconrnendation to all Departments ci the Government of India and all Local Governments and Administrations for their approval.7? extract paragraph 1 of Oopy of/express lotitor No« G-» 102hle9&lt;» dc.ticd tihe IStii ^pril 1938, from the High Conmissioner for Indip., General DGpp.rtment, Indi^.

The High Commissioner is advised that the residential our.lification originally laid down in Section 23 (1) of the Widows* Orphans 5 and Old Age Contributory Pensions ^ct, 1925, has be^n repealed, and consecuently, if the benefits of voluntary insurance were extended to the Officer grade ? it would not be necessary for appointees of thrt grade to be gxa nted pay other than in '.ccordance with the existing regulations, ioO's.-, from the dato of disembarkation in Inaj_a» The Ministry of Health aserve, however,, that this fact would not assist this class of appointee if the ordinary conditions for voluntary in surance were not satisfied, in other words, the Offioor must ust..blioh his eligibility to become a volunt?.ry contributor..

SulDjecto- Scheme for voluntarj/- insurance under the National Health and Insurance Acts, and the Widows* Orphans* and Old Age Contributory Pensions iicts. Sir, I am directed to invite a reference to the correspondence resting with my letter No.5 1 .6(13)-B.,II/37 dated the 4th July 1938 on the subject mentioned above. 2® In your letter No.G-. 102. 1. dated the 21st December 1936, it was suggested that in order to :avoid certain practical difficulties the text of the agreement should provide that the appointee should enter the service 'on the day preceding the date of embarkation for India', and not as originally approved *' on the date of execution of thisjagreement ' . Again, in your letter No.G- 102. 1. 9. dated the 12th April 1936 it has been stated that the residential qualification originally laid down t, in section 23(1) of the Widows* Orphans* and Old Age Contributory Pensions Act, 1925, has been repealed and that consecuently it would not be necessary for appointees to the Superior Services to be granted pay from a date other than the date of disembarka tion in India. Por the same reason, it is assumed that it would also not be necessary for appointees to the Subordinate Services to be granted pay other than from the date of embarkation for India.4 ~2~ Thus it seems, thvfc in order thc.t an appointee who is engaged in insurable employxient in the United Kingdom may continue to remain insured under the National Health Insurance x^cts nd the Tidov/s* Orphans* and Old Age Gontrihutory Pensions Acts, it will suffice if provision is 'made- in the agreement that (1) in the case of an officer who receives a second class passage to India, the service shall commence from the date of his embarkation for India, and (2) in the case of an officer entitled to a first class ^ passage to India, the service shall commence from the date cf his disembarkation in India. The model agreement form No.I has been amended accordingly / and I enclose a copy of the amendments for your information. a new clause 11 a has been inserted pursuant to the orders issued in my letter No.?. 6{13)-R.11/37 dated the 4th July 1938 to your address. 2.

Subject»- xToposal to modify the interpretation of the u:rpri&amp;bion k, tlib date on which the appointr-jent is made 1 ' in Kule 1 a ('b) of the Superior Oivil Services Rules, in its application to Indian Civil Service officers recruited under the neij arrangement. I am directed to invite a reference to the correspon dence ending -/ith your letter No. S. &amp; G-. 678^/57, dated the 29th November 1937, in which the Secretary of Stat:- for India approved the suggestion of the Government of India that the new interpretation of the v/ords 'the date on which the appointment is made^ occurring in R u I l lAih) of the Superior Civil Services Rules should have eifeCt from the dato of the lettor from the India Office which conveyed that interpretation,, viz^ 6th January 19o7, I am ' go point out that, so far as officers of the Indian Civil ^rvice are concerned, that interpretation can hold good only in respect of such officers as were recruited under the old arrangements. Under those arrangements, the Secretary of State's despatch announcing appointment to the Indian Civil Service used to 'be issued, and the covenant us^d- to 'be executed, aft^r the probation had 'been successfully completed. Und.r the arrangement recently decided upon, hoover, the Secretary of State's despatch announcing ap, ointment to the Indian Civil Service is to he issued at the 'beginning of the probationary period instead of at the end, while the covenant is to 'be entered into, as hitherto, on comple tion of that period. As the date of the Secretary of S-oate's despatch will now invariably 'be considerably earlier than the date of execution of the covenant, the phrase 'whichever is earlier' has lost its significance with r^fcrtnce to officers of the Indian Oivil Service recrui -G ^d under the new arrangement. On the other hand the interpretation if applied, as it stands, to such officers would have theeffect of giving them rn unintended 'bonofit ine.sr.uch as it T/ould allow tlioin to count tticir pro'b.'.tior .r^; j. .riod Iso as servico for the purpose of the OoriCoSSions. X am, therefore, tc recuest that the becr^tary of State for India may ho moved to modify the Int^rpreU- tion so as to make it clep.r that, so far c.s p ^ j - s ^ l - S ^ o in ted to'he members of the Indian Civil Service, on - rooetion, under xiule 2 o^ the Indian Civil Service (irohationary bervice) Hules, 1937, or correSi-oedmg rulo&amp; made 'Dhureaiter, -ro conoeru &lt;1, ijiie e^spr^ssion 'the date on which, the appointment is made 1 ' will mean th- date of the ex^cucion of the covenant.

OFFICE MKMOHANniJlv;. Que,']egt. Transfer 01 land to and from a commercial Department (other than the Railway Department) of the Central Government. The undersigned is directed to invite a reference to paragraph 486 of the Public forks Account Code and rules II and IV in Appendix 6 to the Civil Account Code, Volume I, according to wnich full market value is chargeable in respect ofc.ny l-.nd 'hicn is transferred to or by a commercial Department. The Finance Department have had under consideration the question whether this position is equitable as oetween the various Departments oi the Central Government and have come to the conclusion that the commercial aspects of the commercial Departments nave been overdone vis a vi s the Central Government and vis ^ vis one another. Land belongs to Government as a whole and not to c.ny particular Department of Government and the commercialisation of a Department's accounts does not justify that Department in making large capital profits out of sister Departments. It has therefore been decided that transfers of land from or to a commercial Department of the Government of India, otaer than the Railway Department, shall be effected on the following basis. c * ^he case of transfer to or from a commercial Department other than the Dnfence nari?i-t. ment, the following charges shall bo made;— (a)...«2- (a) 'no charge v/here the land is borne in the books at no value, and (b) book value or market value, v /hichever is less, whore the land is valued in the books. B. In the case of transfers to or from the Defence Department the following charges shall be made : — (a) half market value where the land is borne on the books at no value, and (b) book value or market value, whichever is less, subject to a minimum of half market value, where the land is valued in the books, 3. In the case of transfer of landing grounds in Army or Royal Air Force charge to the Civil Aviation Department, the arrangement stated in paragraph 2 will be the basis of settlement, but every case will be treated on its merits and the amount of compensation to be paid to the Defence Department will be settled by negotiation between the two Departments, and in no case will the compensation to be paid exceed that vhich would be payable under the arrangement prescribed in paragraph 2 above. 4. 'If any dispute arises in the application of these rules, it is requested that the matter may be referred to the Finance Department.

I./24, dated the 11th February 1929, as amended by Resolution No. D.-484-R.-II, dated the 15th February 1930, in respect of officers other than military officers in foreign service, the Governor General in Coun cil is pleased to prescribe, with reference J,o Fundamental Rules 116 and 117, the rates of contributions set out in the Annexure to this Resolution. Except to the extent indicated m paragraphs 2 and 3 below, the general principles on which the revised rates have been calculated are the same as were stated in the Resolutions referred to above. 2. (a) For the purpose of contribution for pen sion Government servants have been reclassified in the following six grades; — (1) Members of the Indian Civil Service with non-Asiatic domicile. (2) Members of the Indian Civil Service with Asiatic domicile. (3) Members of the other all-India and Class I Central Services with non- Asiatic domicile. (4) Members of the other all-India and Class I Central Services with Asiatic domicile. (5) Members of the Class TI Central Ser vices. (0) Members of the Subordinate Central Services. (b) The rate of interest adopted in the cal culations of contribution for pension is 3| per cent, per annum instead of 4^ per cent, per annum adopted in 1929, and accounts for the increase in the rates of contribution. (c) The rates of mortality assumed for the various classes of Government servants are slightly different from those adopted in 1929 and are based on expert actuarial advice. 3. For the purpose of contribution for leave salary also, the classification of Government servants governed by leave rules other than the Revised Leave Rules, 1933, has been modified as shown in the Annexure. 4. The rates of contribution for leave salary m respect of officers governed by the Revised Leave Rules are still under consideration and will be promulgated as soon as possible. 0. A Government servant who is a subscriber to a Contributory Provident Fund and who is transferred to foreign service shall, if he is allowed to retain that privilege, pay monthly subscriptions calculated on the rate of pay drawn in foreign service. The foreign employer, or the officer himself, according to the arrange ment made under clause (c) of Fundamental Rule 115, shall pay in addition, at such times as Government may prescribe in each case, a contribution calculated on the monthly subscrip tions so determined and equal in amount to what Government would have credited to the subscriber's account on that basis.

In arriving at the rate mentioned in the preceding paragraph it was not found feasible to proceed on the basis of the actual amount of leave taken by Government servants under the Revised Leave Rules. The rate was calculated by making the following assumptions ;— (1) The average length of service of a Gov ernment servant surviving till pen sion is 32 years. (This is based on actuarial advice.) (2) The amount of earned leave (on aver age pay) enjoyed by a Government servant is on the average the maxi mum amount of such leave admis sible to him. (3) The amount of leave on private affairs, or on medical certificate, {i.e., leave on half average pay), enjoyed by a Gov ernment servant is roughly half the maximum amount of such leave ad missible to him. 3.

Sir, . r ^ ■ - I am directed to invite a-reference to this Department,-Resolution No.F.22-XEI-Ex.11/27, dated the -IBth-August 1929, in vdiich general'principles applicable to contracts involving expenditure from Central Revenues prescribed. It has been the practice of Government in the past to Include, usually, in long term agreements and contracts a provision for an unconditional povver of revocation or cancellation of such contracts by Govern ment at any time on the expiry of six months' notice to ^hat effect. The inclusion of this condition in the contracts is useful to Government in that they can re revoke a contract when there is a big drop in the nr rket rates of material and labour or when some other unfore seen, situation arises. Such - a xourse was enjoined by the rules contained in Appendix 8 F to the Civil Account Code, Volume I, and it vjo .s not considered necessary to include any instructions to this effect in the Resolution referred to above. The rules in Appendix 8 F to the Civil Account Code, Volume I, were made under Statutes 22 and 23 Vic. C 41 and have ceased to be in force with the introduction of the Government of India Act, 1935. The Government of India have accordingly decided that all officers entering into contracts enduring or likelyto endure for a period ol more than 5 years, on behalf of Goverment, should, wherever feasible, continue to include in the agreements or contracts the condition mentioned' above. •- I have the honour to be, • . .

I am directed to invite a reference to the Indian Finance (No.2) Bill, 1940 which was introduced in the Legislative Assembly on the 5th November 1940* The Bill has been published at pages 231-232 of Part f of the Gazette of India dated ths 9th November 1940i 2. Sub-clause (1) of clause 3 of the Bill purports to increase the rates of income-tax and super-tax imposed -by sub-scction (1) of section 7 of the Indian Finance .^ct, 1940 (XVI of 1940) by a surcharge amounting to one-twelfth oi each suci: rate. This surcharge is leviable in respect of the year beginning on the 1st day of April 1940. 3. In regard to salaries sub-clause (3) of section 3 of the Bill provides that the amount by which any deduction made under section 18(2) of the Income-tax Act falls snort oi the deduction which could have be n made had the surcharge be .n then in force shall be de med to bo a deficiency arising out of a previous deduction or failure to deduct for tne purposes of that section. It follows therefore that when the Bill be comes law disbursing officers will hav^. to maku. acijustmcnts in respect of the tax already deducted from the salaries disbursed by them. Such adjustments will mvolv. an additional deduc tion of 2d% of the tax for the last four months of the year. 4. It is hoped that the Bill will become law before the 1st December 1940. In that event disbursing officers should deduct from the salaries disbursed by them on or after the 1st Decembe 1940, the average monthly rate of tax already determined plus one -fourth thereof. 5. I am to request that necessary warning may Kindly be given to all disbursing officers und^r your control.r (Cow of a letter C.

As regards category (i) above the Central Government have decided to frame for Officers under theirule making controloff the Governor Gtneral in Council, rules similar to 'The Secretary of Stat,.'s Services (War inlun- s) Bules, 1940'. ' As regards category (ii) the argument advanod by the India Office applies ecually in the case of Governor General in Courci^s officers.

The Government of Inaia would then issue a corresponding rule in respect of parsonnel Recruited for the- Central GDvernmenT. and Provincial Governments would he informed of the action oaken, so that they ought consider taking similar action in respect of personnel' recrui Ged.'f or ; the : services under their control- .1. ' ■' .IC' T 3o I am to add that the Government of . India do not think it necessary to extend the provisions of the kinistr^ of Pensions Personal Injuries Scheme for Civilians to pensionable'or non- -pensionahle civilian officers already employea under them to cover such officers during the vo^^age periods when proceeding to and from Great Britain on duty, as they feel that the war risks visualized hy the Scheme will satisfy the conditions of Article 746-B, Civil Service Hegulations, and the definitions of special risks in rule 3(7) of the Superior Civil Services (Extraordinary Pension) Pules, as- well as in rule 3(7)(ii) of the Central Civil Services (Extraordinary Pension) Pules. In the opinion of the Government of India, these rules offer adecuate cocnen-^ .sation in respect of any disability that-might-.he sustained or death caused-through any stecial war risk. If the Secretary of State concurs in this view. Provincial Govern:r nts will he informed accordingly, 4. I am further to request that the decision of the Secretary of State may 'be communicated to. this Department as early as possible.Copy of letter Ko.I. 769f/40, dated the 3rd July 1940, f c ^ Ii ° e &gt; Financial Department, Whitehall, Lender to the G-cvc rnment of India, Defence Department, (Army Branch). ' In reply to your le.tter dated 26th Larch, 1940, Fo.B/ 57636/1/ a «G#14, I am directea to ir.fom. you that the Secretary of State agrees that the kinietry of Pensions lersor.al Injuries Scheme for civilians should apply during the period oi their lirst voyage to India to all civilian personnel,* whether pensionatle or not, 7;ho are recruited m Great Britain for service in India and I am to enclose a co^ v ct 3 rule made 'by the. Secretary of State under Section S47 ct the G-cv-rnmcnt of Inuia Act applying the scheu .r to oi^iccrs sLTomt— ed to the Indian Civil Service and Indian iolice. As regards officers of the Indian Services deputed to this country, the Secretary of State does not consider that Article 746B of the Civil Service Regulations or the Superior Civil Services Extraordinary Pension Rules can he held to arnly in terms to the risks involved in Journeys oy sea 'between India and the United Kingdom in present circumstances. He is, however, prepared in the exercise of the discretion con- 1 erred on him hy Rule 8 of the Superior Civil Services Extra ordinary Pension Rules to treat war injuries received 'by Government servants during the voyages to and irom the United Kingaom on duty as qualifying for awards under these Rules and, subject to the concurrence of the Government ct India, to treat war injuries received hy such ofiicsrs while on duty in this country similarly. As at present advised the Secretary of State sees no reason to provide compensation from Indian revenues for war injuries received by oliicers of the Indian services while on leave out of India, the risk of injury in such cases 'being one against which officers should if they wish secure themselves 'by insurance. The Government of India will no douot consider whether conaitions in India are such as to warrant the application of the Extraordinary Pension Rules to war injuries received hy Government servants in that country ani if so whether any distinction should he made between war injuries received while an officer is actually on duty or otherwise. If the Government of India should wish to recommend that the Rules should apply in respect of war injuries without regard to the question whether the officer was actually on duty at the time of receiving the injury, the question whether a scheme similar to that made hy the Minister of Pensions, with suitable adaptations to Indian conditions, should he framed to cover war injuries to the civil population, might have to he considered./ 4 / Ko. 436-67/' British Kesidency and Conai Bushire, the 9tJi April, 1941* f r Rej.

The undersigned is directed to refer to this Department Office Lemorandum No.37-¥(S)/42. dated the 5rd November 1942, on the subject«t noted a'bove, and to say that the compensation afforded 'by the present orders has been considered inadequate to meet the needs of low-paid Government servants. The Government of India have, accordingly, with the approval of the Secretary of State decided that the existing orders should he modified so as to allow compensation not exceeding actual proved loss or Es. 1,000/- whichever is less, without reference to the rate of pay of the official• The compensation is strictly intended for personal kit, and no compensation will 'be granted for articles, such as orna ments , hooks, silver utensils, etc •, which can be termed as luxu ries. Bach case should he scrutinized and considered on merits and the final award should be granted in consultation with the finance Department. Particular attention is ftrawn to the fact that the grant of this compensation is subject to the proviso that, if after the war any general scheme for compensation for loss of property through enemy action is sanctioned, the compensation now granted will oe treated as an advance payment under this scheme. 2. 'The Government of India have also had under consideration the question of granting some relief to Central Government servants who may suffer loss of personal kit due to enemy action in India such.as air homhing, etc. They have come the conclusion that \vhile they cannot agree to the grant of compensation to Government servants for such losses, in view of the vast commitment involved and the difficulty in dirreren uiating 'between the general public and Government servants, advances may justifiably 'be granted to enable Government servants to re-equip themselves. They have / y accordingly decided to grant recoverable advances to Central Government servants who are paid from civil estiiaates as follows :- ( i) Special advances upto three months* pay, not exceeding the actual amount required to replace the necessary articles lost and subject to a maxirauni limit of Ss.2,500/-, recoverable in not more than 36 monthly instalrpents, beginning from the salary of the month following that in whicn the advance is drawn. ( ii) The advances will be interest-free. (ill) No person should be allowed a second advance, without special sanction of the Finance Department. ( ly) Advances to temporary Governmeht servants should be granted against a personal security of some pernianent Government servants. 3. The other conditions regarding the grant of advances laid down in the finance Department Office Memorandum No.37-W{S}/42 f dated the 3rd November 1942, apply mutatis mutandis in the case of the above advances. m1.

In view of the waste of time and paper which will be involved in maintaining service books in respect of such temporary Goveiment servants, it has been decided in consultation with the Auditor General, that in their case a statement of service in the fiorm below (Annexure) should be maintained by the Head of the office.

S ubject :— Billeting curranqements for Central (jlowrmnenf officers on tour at Calcutta, Bombay and Karachi. The undersigned is directed to say that in view of the difficulty which touring officers experience at Calcutta, Bombay and Karachi in obtaining accomodation at reasonable prices, the Government of India have deci^d that there shall be a billeting officer at each of these three cities for the purpose of helping touring officers to find suitable accommodation. The billeting officer for each city will be the Executive Engineer, Central Public Works Department. An officer g )ing on tour to any of these cities who has been unable to obtain bogrd and lodging at a.figure less than the daily allowance admissible to him plus rupees three a day if he is a grade I officer as defined in Supplementary Rule 17, or rupees two a day, if he is a grade II officer; may write to the billeting officer concerned and ask that accommodation be pRn ided. Tl^e billeting officer will there upon provide suitable accommodation within the daily allowance of the officer concerned fHu-&gt; rupees three, or two per day, as the case may be, or certify that as accommodatiori is not available within these figures the officer may take rooms in a specified hotel or in one of several specified hotels. A touring officer who takes rooms in one of the hotels so indi cated will then be entitled to charge in his travelling allowance bill the daily excess of the hotel tariff for board and lodging over his daily allow ance plus rupees three or two as the case may be. In support of such a claim the certificate from the billeting officer end the receipted hotel bill should invariably be attached to tin travelling allowance bill, and no reimbursement should be claimed for extras such as drinks and taxis. *2. These arrangements will be in operation from the 1st of May 1941 fo 1 ^^ period of 6 months. So as to enable the Government of India to consider whether they should l)e extended beyond this period, all Depart ments and Attached Offices are requested to forward to the Finance Department monthl\statement8 showing the total amount claimed by touring officers under their operation. The amount so indicated should be the difference between what the officers concerned would have drawn as daily allowance and what they have actually been permitted to draw on the basis of certificates issued by billeting officers.

An impression seems to ejcist in certain quarters that the touring officers will depend wholly for their accommodation on the billeting officers. It may be explained that the billeting officers in the three cities in question have been c.harged with the res ponsibility of finding accommodation for such ol' the touring officers of the Central Grovemwent, as are unable to find accommo dation for themselves. This presupposes that the intention of the schema is not to relieve the touring officers o^ their responiiibi- lity to try and find accommodation for themselves, and that tie officers concerned should approach the billeting off ice. only after they have failed to secure accommodation tnrough -heir own efforts.

Subject:- Tenas to he granted to officers, other than Eailway Officers, under the rule-making con trol of the Governor General In Council on appointment to civil departments during leave preparatory to retirement. Sir, The Governor General in Council has had under considera tion the question of the terms and conditions of service to 'be offered to Government servants (other than Eailway employees) under his rule-making control who may he permitted to accept appointments in civil departments of the Central Government including the Ballway Department and the Political DepartmeJlt during leave preparatory to retirement. The Governor General in Council is now pleased to decide as follows:- (a) If a Government servant who is on leave preparatory to retirement is required for x further service in his parent department or office in or outside India, his leave should he cancelled and he should 'be recalled to duty. (h) If the re-employment is in a post other than in his parent department, or office, the Government servant concerned will 'be given the option of (1) retiring forthwith; or (il) remaining on leave, while performing duty in the post, until he has exhausted the leave granted to hiin or chooses to retire. (c) If the Government servant elects to remain on leave under clause ('b) (11) will, during the period of such leave, draw in addition to the pay of the new post to which he is appointed, his leave salary as follows :- I. If the re-employment is in India the leave salary shall not exceed— (l)ln the case of a member of a Class I or Class II Central Service whose service is pensionable, the amount of pension, which it is anticipated will he admissible to bim on retirement. No subsequent readjustment of such anticipatory pension will he made on the basis of actual pmslon. (11) In the case of all non-pensionable Government ser vants a-nd pensionable Government servants of the Central Sub ordinate Services, half of leave salary admissible in respect of leave on full pay or full average pay, as the case may be. II. If the re-employment is outside India, the full leave salary admissible to him under the rules shall be granted during the/--2- the period of the present hostilities; and. on the termination of hostilities leave salary will 'be restricted in the same way as if the re-employment were in India • 2. In a case where option to remain on leave has 'been exer cised under clause (*b) (ii) above, the pay of the officer shall on retirement 'be refixed in accordance with the rules applicable to re-employed pensioners.

I am directed to invite a reference to Mr. Nehru*s letter B.Dis.No.69-Stamps/38 f dated the 20th September, 1938, intimating amendments to Bule 44 in Vol.VI of the Posts and Telegraphs Manual whereby the Postmasters in charge of Head Post Offices Et were authorised to exchange useless or obsolete postage stamps etc., for serviceable ones from the treasuries. It will be seen that the proviso at the end of paragraph 1 of that letter requiring articles to be presented for exchange in complete sheets, related to embossed envelopes, wrappers or post cards only and not to postage stamps. It is, however, reported that postage stamps when not in complete sheets are not exchanged at the treasuries in several provinces with the result that the value of such stamps is written off by the Post Offices and the stamps are then sent to the Audit Office for destruction. Such a procedure is clearly undesirable and should be rescinded. 2. In the circumstances explained, I am to request that, if the Provincial Government see no you objection, necessary instructions may be issued to the Treasury Officers under their/your control in order that obsolete and useless postage stamps even when less than in complete sheets may be exchanged for serviceable ones from the treasuries as laid down in the Bales. =====++++====== b8«No. 2287-60/49.
