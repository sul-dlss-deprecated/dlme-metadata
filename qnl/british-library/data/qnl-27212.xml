The book has nine chapters on different crafts: electroplating; the dyeing of fabric; photography; candle-making; and the manufacture of ink, glue, mirrors, ceramics, and soap. A tenth chapter discusses chemical compounds. Most of the book is devoted to three crafts: electroplating, including plating and galvanizing techniques involving copper, brass, gold, and silver; the dyeing of fabric, including natural and artificial dye sources for a variety of colors and fibers; and photography. The final chapter on chemicals includes a section on antidotes to be used in the case of poisoning. The book has numerous illustrations and a table of contents. Jirjīs Ṭannūs ʻAwn dedicates his work to the Ottoman statesman, author, and reformer Ahmet Cevdet Pasha (1822−95), a highly cultured and literate man. According to the cover, the author used his own funds for this printing.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Handicraft</topic></subject><subject><topic>Metalwork</topic></subject><subject><topic>Electroplating</topic></subject><subject><topic>Textile</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Lebanon</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Art--Study and teaching</topic></subject><subject><topic>Photography</topic></subject><subject><topic>Poison</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Beirut</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Dyes and dyeing</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/qnlhc/12916#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
