Your i£xoellency» I hare the honour to fonward herewith a translation of a letter addres ed by the Shaikh of Kuwait to the Political Agent and of its enclosures* 2* The miin point for consideration ia whether Hia Highness should be advised to employ armed guards for the protect ion of his share of the date crops in his gardens at iteo. 1 understand that as stated in the draft application to the Iraqi Kinister of the Interior it is the custom for landowners in the Basra Liwa to maintain armed guards in their gardens during the harvest season and I have heard the Shaikh of Kuwait blamed for not employing such guards before, his refusal to do so being attributed to parsimony. Actually in 19 45 the Shaikh did consider the possibility of sending some Kuwaitis to i'ao to protect his rights but this proposal fell thro^*gh because Kao was a Prescribed Area' under the Iraq .Defence Regulation and no foreigner wag allowed to proceed there without a permit from the Mutasa&amp;rif which that official refused to grant at that time. 5. 1 think it would prooably be undesirable for the Shaikh to employ Kuwaitis as guards on this occasion even if the Iraqi authorities are willing to permit him to do so but there would appear to be no prima facie objection to hi® employing Iraqis for the purpose, provided he can find any willing to serve him, if as is stated it is the custom for landowners to maintain armed guards in their gardens during the harvest season. The Political Agent considers it unlikely that His Highness will be able to obtain permission to employ armed guards witnout Your Excellency’s intervention but it is not clear from the papers I have received that any formal parities?ion is necessary and the draft application only asks that security should be taken from the tenants to keep the peace and not interfere with the guards. 4. 1 should be grateful if Your Excellency will kiiidly advise me regarding the reply to be given to the ohai^h’s letter and would also kindly let me know whether you recommend that the draft application should be submitted to the Iraqi Minister of, the Interior in the form proposed and whether you would be willing to intervene in support of it if neceesary. If you are opposed to the appointment of amed guards is there any other course you can recommend for the Shaikh to follow in order to obtain his share of the date crop in his gardens at Kao. 5.

Kay's letter Uo.740-S of the 28th April last to the Ambassador, on the subject of the GhaiXli of Kuwait’s date gardens at K'ao, I had another talk with Judge Good about this affair this morning. Judge Good says that he is still hopeful that the appeals will be heard at any early date though so far the hearing has been adjourned again and again owing to delaying tactics on the part of the lawyers ol the opposite side. Judge Good says however that he has now given the Iraqi J+±tiU.;G in charge of the case a final warning that he must £et oh with it within the next week or ten days* If he does not do so Judge Good will report him confidentially to the Ministry of Justice and as k ther Judge to be sent down to hear Hrr honest and well-intentioned s -u^ e Good says, but may possibly be somewhat chafljr of antagonizing the powerful interests concerned in the appeal s, a gainst the Shaikh'and therefore inclined to plit things off as long as possible. I r the Lieantime, while the apjjeals are undecided Judge Good says the rights of ownership, including the custom.- ry right to appoint armed guards to secure the crop, rest with the Shaikh and his associates who should certainly apply to the Ministry of the Interior for authority to appoint them. Only they should not lose much time over doing this, and they would be well advised to be on the look-out for some counter-move by the opposite party who pre up to all the tricks end appear to have some influence through their lawyer with our Mutasarrif, *min Khalis.

(Dear Hay) Your despatch KC.74G-S of April 28th to the Ambassador who Is unfortunately 111 and unable to reply personally. You will have seen Davis’s letter No.Sl? of May 5th which gives Judge Good’s opinion on the question of armed guards for the Shaikh of Knwaits date gardens at Basra. All authorities are I think agreed that some sort of custom exists whereby landowners taay employ armed men to guard their date crops at harvest time. The Adviser to the Ministry of Interior considers however that the first approach should be by the Shaikh's son and lawyers to the Mutesarrif of Basra. Ko decision would be taken in Bagdad without reference to the Mutesarrif and it therefore seems preferable to try him first. If this approach has net produced satisfactory resu ts within a month the Shaikh should then apply to the Ministry of Interior and we will send in an official supporting note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I see nothing in the Shaikh’s draft application to the Minister that need be altered if it eventually has to be sent.

I left Kuwait by air on the 20th May in the forenoon and Basra by tmin the same evening. While in Basra I discussed with the Consulate the possibility of exchanging weekly bags (your express letter No.786-S s. anted the 1 st May, 1947) and was able to inform then that / ll/b Tir. Nelson of the Kuwait Oil Company is now stationed in Basra in charge of movements of personnel and could arrange frequent safe-hand opportunities to Kuwait. I also dis cussed the date-garden question. 3 . I saw the Public Relations Officer and dis cussed with hioi the question of opening a reading-room in Kuwait and understood that Public Relations are in favour of this. 4. I arrived in Baghdad a.m. on the 21st Pay and left by air for Kuv/ait a.n. on the 26th.. niiile there ^ . I discussed the date-garden question in general with Hr. Busk and in considerable detail with Hr. Walker, the Oriental Secretary. I emphasised the fact that, as appealf to the Court of Cassation will lie when the appeals now filed have bean decided, there is no prospect of the legal wrangle being concluded by the time the 1947 date-crop ripens J and stressed the necessity of avoiding a recurrence of the daylight robbery which has taken place in the last q'fevT years. I was shown the Embassy’s letter No.528/13/47 dated the 14th May, 1947 and pointed out that as the Mutasarrif of Basra has previously refused the Shaikh per mission to apj^oint guards over his crops it is most im probable that he would agree now. I suggested that he might give a uon-coxamittal reply to the application and, at the last moment when it was too late for the Shaiich to approach higher authorities, take action to make the employment of guards impossible. We agreed that tlie Shaikh should ask the Mutasarrif to confirm that there will be no objection to the appointment of guards and, should categorical confirmation not be forthcoming, the Ministry of the Interior should be approached forthwith. I told them that the Shaikh was certain that the Ministry of the Interior would refuse the application unless it was strongly supported by the Embassy. I asKed them if they could amplify the phrase ’’powerful interests concerned in the appeals against the Shaikh” appearing in the Consulate-General, Basra’s despatch No.817* 2 . despatch No.817 (24/l/l-C dated the 5th May, 1947 and was Informed that they did not consider that the Iraqi Cabinet had issued any directive to officials to penalise the Shaikh. The opposition comes, I think, from Suleiman Shawwaf’s influential connections in the Iraqi Ministry of the Interior. 5. I also disaussed the Iraqi Airways service and pointed out their error in addressing their telegram No.11 of the 18th April, 1947 to me end not to the Political Resident. ^ / nfio 6 . We mentioned the incident which formed the subject of my telegram No.327 dated the 24th April, 1947. I understood that the Iraqi version is almost the direct opposite of the Kuwait one and I re-iterated that I had personally verified that the incident did in fact take plac well inside the Kuwait territory. 7 . I also had an informative discussion with Mr. Pelham, the Commercial Counsellor, on the subject of dollar exchange and current sterling earnings. I was able to correct his impression that dollars are freely granted for the import into Kuwait of goods which are^subsequently smuggled Into Iraq. He gave it as his opinion that Oil Royalties paid to Kuwait are ^current sterling earnings' and should be made freely convertible into dollars when the time comes. 3 .

British Embassy, Bagdad. 713A/47 '-26th May, 1947 CONFIDENTIAL Dear Consulate-General, Please refer to our Note Verbale No.596 of September 24th, 1946, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, sent to you with our Printed tletter N 0 . 3 I (610/7/46) on the subject of a plot of land at Fao belonging to the Shaikh of Kowait which the Port Directorate wished to acquire for houses. We now enclose a copy in translation of the Iraqi reply which seems to us to have been inspired by one or both of two motives. Either, the Iraqi Government feel that it would be wrong to negotiate as between one Government and another over a plot of land inlraqi territory - ire. the Embassy ought not to have been brought in and the negotiations should have been between an Iraqi authority, e.g. the Portland the Shaikh or his son as a private landowner. Or, the piece of land in question may be part of plot No.21 containing the village of Fao which was declared in Land Settlement to belong to the Shaikh but which is claimed by the Ministry of Finance - i.e. the Iraqi Government are not going to prejudice a decision by renting from the Shaikh land which they claim is theirs. The latter explanation may not be valid as we cannot see any indication of the plot number on the plan sent to us with Knight*s despatch No .6 of February 15th, 1946. Perhaps you could verify this point? In either case the result appears to be unsatisfactory and we should be glad to know what has happened to the scheme for building new houses for the Bar Dredging Service. Has it been abandoned, or has an alternative site been acquired?

After Compliments, I have the honour to enclose herewith a letter from the lawyers Hasan Abdulrahman and Abdulrctiiinan al^tXmar, in _..jiiich they explain the stage our cases in Ea^ra Courts have reached. The lawyer states that the judge who is to hear our appeals has agreed with the tenants f 'lawyer to put our appeals off a.^ain and again giving various excuses so that they may make awav with this year , s crops as they did in the previous years. I have met Judge Cood, the Chief Judge, and explained every thing to him. He promi. ed to write to the Ministry of Justice and ask them to appoint a special Judge to hear the appeals of the Subah only. The following is the number and date of the letter to the Ministry of Justice No. 1463, dated the 31st May, 1947. Subject- Request for appointment of a judge to hear the Subah 1 s appeals. v k a in His Excellency the British Consul-General has duly ked Hasan Abdulrahman the lawyer to submit an application name to His Excellency the Mutasarrif of my Basra requesting the appointment of guards on our property at Eao to secure our share of the crop and prevent the tenants from stealing it. We undertake to make good any shortage or damage which the tenants may suffer if they are granted any rights, as Your Highness can see from the copy of the application attached herewith. In fact I went with my lawyer and met the Mutasarrii and handed the application to him. He, after reading it, became very angry and said, w I refuse this application. As the Court of Anneal of the Land Settlement has not yet passed judgement, my denartment has no right to interfere in any matter. You must refer the ratter to +v ’e Court.' The lawyer replied, '^rite a do. n on the application whatever you like and we have the right to appeal against yo .r decision to the Ministry of Inter ior. ' I, myself, do not like his being angry, because we know that we rare struggling for our rights of uhich we have been deprived. After leaving the Iiutasarrif I went to His Excellency the Consul-General and told him all the Mutasarrif had said. He asked me to obtain the M.^tasarrif 1 s comments on on our application. On Saturday the registrar informed our lawyer on the phone that our application ha^ been sent to Qaimmakam of Abul-Khasib. The lawyer informed me of the registrar’s message and we went to Abul-Khasib met the Qaimmakam and asked him to let us know sarrix nctd coindented on our amplication. This Your Highness can see, it is written below the application. He said, ' We cannot allow you to post guards at Fao becauise the Court of Settl^m^nt has not yet decided the appeals. ' This was exactly as we were told by the Mutasarrif. On Monday I called on His Excellency the Consul- General and gave him a copy of the Mutasarrif’s comments on the application. T gave him the number and dat® Good’s letter to the Ministry of Justice, follow it up in order that the sending of the appeals may not be delayed, because the Chief Judge has asked the lavyer to follow up his letter to the Ministry of Justice about the delay.

No. 1147 (19/4/10) British Consulate-General Basra. June 16 th, 1947 Dear Chancery Mr. Davis saw the Acting Director-General of Ports and Navigation on the 14th June and asked him about the plot of land at Fao belonging to the Shaikh of Kowait which the Port Directorate v/ished to acquire for houses. (Your letter 713/4/47 of the 26th May refers). Colonel Pennant explained that there was nothing political or involved in the Iraq Governments reply. The simple fact is that the irort really do not want to lease the land now. Since they first made the proposal there has been one new factor which has completely changed the pict’ire as far as the Port of Basra is concerned and that is, the Anglo- Iranian Oil Co. are bringing out a dry-dock capable of taking anything up to 6,000 tons, are*installing it in Abadan, and are offering the Port of Basra the use of it (without any engineering facilities) for ninety days per annum. This dry-dock is expected to arrive as' soon as the aonsoon ends and its arrival will earn that the Port Dredgers v/hich have hitherto had to go to Bombay for repair and refit, losing a great deal of time on the voyage there and back, will now be dry-docked at Abadan instead. But as the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. will not provide the engineering facilities, their service stopping short at the mere provision of the dry-dock, the Port of Basra will itself have to lay on a complete set-up for overhauling their own dredgers. With this in view they are planning a big installation on the Iraqi bank of the Shatt-ul-Arab opposite the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co.*s tank farm at Bawarda on land which they have acquired from the Iraq Government. Here, in addition to engineering shops,’ they will build houses for staff (including the harbour-masters whose accommodation he hitherto been a problem), a club with full recreational facilities, and eventually (they hope) a technical school where they will complete the education of the lyaqi apprentices whom they hope to train in the engineering shops etc. ^ When this scheme is operating the Port installation at Fao will be a very small thing indeed and the ground they already have there will be more than ample for all purposes. Incidentally, five nice bungalows are under construction at Fao for the Port staff and v;e understand that they will be ready for occupation very shortly. This will greatly alleviate the housing shortage downthere. /When The Chancery, His Majesty’s Embassy Bagdad.When the new scheme opposite Bawartia comes into operation the isolation of the small staff at Fao will be greatly diminished since they will be little more than an hour away by road from the new installation which as we have said will have full recreational facilities and will also have quite a large resident staff, European as well as Iraqi* The new installation itself will only be about an hour and twenty minutes by road from Basra and the Port v/ill provide a service of buses between the two places so that the community there will also not be able to complain of isolation* We trust that this simple explanation of the Port’s reasons for not now wanting the Shaikh’s land at Fao will dispose of the two more recondite and tortuous explanations proposed in your letter 713/4/47.

Firstly, the lawyer should submit an appeal personally to the Ministry of Interior, Baghdad, on the subject of posting guards at Faw, and the second is to get ready for precautionary attachment through the court. The lawyer lias already prepared the appeal, which is enclosed herewith for Your Highness* perusal. The lawyer will be leaving for Baghdad to submit this application to the Ministry of Interior after having met the Oriental Secretary in the British Embassy, Baghdad and having received the necessary instructions. He will meet the Minister of Interior and will obtain from him the result of the application. We pray God to grant us success. As to the precautionary attachment through the court, the lawyer is preparing it in case no result is obtained from the Ministry of Interior. / Usual Ending. I.KTranslation of an application dated the 1st July,1947 from His Highness* lawyer, Basra, to the Minister of Interior, Baghde*, C&amp;i To His Excellency the Minister .of Interior. THE APPELLANTS - His Highness Shaikh Ahmed al Jahir as Subah — Shaikh of Kuwait and his companions the heirs of Shaikh Jabir bin Abdulla as Subah, the 1st Ruler of Kuwait, as per the special Legal DiYision, whose lawyers are Hasan Abdulrahman and Abdulrahman al Umar. GROUNDS OP APPEAL - The appellants* lawyers submitted an implication on 'the 28th May, 1947 to His Excellency the Mutasarrif of Basra Liwa to the effect that the tenants at Fao had done atmy with the crops last year and hare tried to delay the final decision on the cases filed^b/ theta in the court of Appeal of Land Settlement for t~- nurpose of doing away with the crops year after year. The appellants have therefore desired to post guards to guard the crops. The number of guards will be according to the Sea. As the responsibility of Publi. Security is 4n the iurisdiction of the Mutasarrif of Basra the appellants hare asked his permission and they also that guarantees for keeping up the peace be obtained rou the tenants who are known to be rioters. The hive promised to produce a responsible person who will be Touched for by the Chamber of Commerce and a Katory Public who will guarantee any rights which may be granted to the tenants as a result of the said cases. ■. The application was spnt to the Qaimmakam of Abul-Khasib and was sent back to the Mutasarrif with letter No.1340 dated the 2nd June, 1947 to the effect that the interference is against Article Ho. 33 of the Law of Settlement as ®PP® a ^ s the letter of the Ministry of Interior No.15938 dated the 9th August, 1.39 addressed to the Ministry of Justice, copy to the Mutasarrifiya. His Excellency the Mutasarrif has minuted on this letter that Your Honour should kindly sanction the posting of the said guards because the fmirt of Anneal of Land Settlement of Basra area has not settled any of the cases of appeal submitted by the tenants. The tenant have increased the number of ttie appeals which are approximately 3,000, with of delaying the settlement of the cases, may be in a position to do away with all date crops and thus affect the rights of the appellants and their ownership of this plot, which was decided by p 1 ® Excellency the Head of the Committee of Land Settlement and by several other written documents.No.528/21/47. 3rd July, 1947.

When this court was closed in June 1945 the appeals were transferred to the Court of Appeal for land settlement cases in Basra. The resignation of the lawyers representing the Sheikh of Kuwait did not take place until December 1946. The Ministry will doubtless agree that there was some delay in the hearing of the appeals before the resignation of the lawyers. 2. The Embassy understands that a new lawyer was appointed by the Sheikh of Kuwait in the middle of March, yet according to the latest information there has still been no attempt by the Court in Basra to hear the cases.

We are thus no nearer a solution than wo wore a year ago and in a oonsidorahly loss favourable position owing to the removal of tho British Judge in Baira. It appears from Shaikh Mshaatnod's letter to his father that tho Special Judge appointed in July was comparatively honest and disinterested, and it seems that efforts should ho made to have tho oases hoard by him.

The lawyer returned from B^hdad today. The case was npt he^urd because the lawyer bulaiman dhawwiif had eoached the Imistry of Justice to transfer the cases to the Basra Court to which he (the Minister of Justice; a^eed and the hearing has therefcjre beon transferred to the Basra Court, as Your Highness will see from the enclosed order of the Ministry of Justice sotting aside their previous order in which they decided that the cases should be transferred to the BagMud court. We have already paid the expenditure to cne clerk for transferring the documents of the cases from the Basra to the Baghdad Court according to the request of ^e Assistiint Chief Judge to me. The Ministry of Justice has now decided to transfer the oases to the wisra Court where we anticipated some perversion of justice (The Arabic word also suggests corruption of the judges) resulting in the Rasing of a judgement against us.

I now await Your Highness 1 orders as to whether Your Hi^mess agrees or not so that I may tell him. Our lawyer informs me that when he was in Baghdad he met the Judge who was to have heard our cases and the judge told him that Sul&amp;iman Shawwaf had asked him to come to an understanding and a number of people interoeeded with him to sass a decree s^inst us but he would not esoree.

Enquiries I have made in Basra reveal that the figures given for the Shaikh's share in mans if accurate indicate that the areas are much smaller than those given. i Values worked out by me are therefore excessively high. 3. I am sending an explanation by letter but cannot see how we can make any more accurate estimate without asking the Shaikh to inform us of the areas of his gardens. Political MB.Basrah 10th January 1948. '*6 Confidential. - Assuming that the estimate you give as the Shaikh's 50 percent share in inarms is correct, then the estimated area in Jaribs appears to be too large. A good garden yields 60 - 70 mann per jarib, and an average garden about 40 mann. It is therefore unlikely that the yield at Fao is less than 20 mann per jarib and at Faddagiyah and Ditawah less than 30 mann per ^arib. On this basis, the area in cultivated jaribs would worK out as follows Total crop in manns 1. Fao 20,000 - 30,000 2. Faddagiyah etc 17000 - 24000 3. Futawah etc 6000 - 3000 Approx area in .jaribs 1000 - 1500 550 - 800 200 - 300 If however the areas you show in jaribs are cultivated, then the crop should be very much larger than the yield shown on the sheet you gave me. As regards values, my information is that the average price per c ultivated jarib in the areas you mention, would probably be between ID.100 - ID.150 per jarib. S’- s - CU C~~ C.

No. 987/987/7/16975 Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arab Affairs Department, Baghdad , 30th October, 1947. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs present their compliments to His Britannic Majesty*s Embassy, Baghdad and, with reference to the correspondence ending with their note verbale dated 9th September, 1947, have the honour to state that the competent Iraqi departments have taken all steps calculated to expedite the completion of the cases relating to the property of the Shaikh of Kuwait in Basra. The Ministry avail themselves of the opportunity to express their highest consideration and esteem. His Britannic Majesty*s Embassy, Baghdad.CuPY AIDE M EMuIRE His Majesty's brnbassy haa for some considerable time been trying to secure a settlement of the question of the Date Gardens of His Highness the Sheikh of Koweit at Fao and now wishes once more to bring to the notice ol the Iraqi Government the most unsatisfactory position in which it has for so long been allowed to remain. 2. In 1938 the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs and His Majesty's Embassy exchanged Notes No. 14184/2440/100 of 30th October, 1938 and No. 586 of 1st November, 1938, in which His Majesty's oovernment agreed to abide by the provisions of the Land Settlement Law No. 29 of 1938 for the regulation of the properties of His Highness the Sheikh of Koweit in Iraq. 3. In 1943 No. iO Land Settlement Board under Judge Good, heard the case of His Highness's date Gardens at Fao and his decision in favour of His Highness was promulgated in Iraq Gazette No. 2166 of the 22nd February, 1944. In accordance with the provisions of the Land Settlement Law, 2764 appeals Appeal were lodged in the Land Settleraent/Court at Baghdad by Saiyid Suleiman Shawaf, a lawyer acting on behalf of the tenants 4, During the summer of 1945, the Land Settlement Appeal Court at Baghdad was closed and the cases transferred to the / new provincial Land Settlement Appeal Court at Basra and after many postponements the cases were first called in January and February 1946. As the Judge of this Court was exceptionally busy and in charge of five other Courts in the Basra Liwa, His Majesty's Government in their Note Vorbale / No. 669 British Embassy, Baghdad, 9th September, 1948. ? 1947 \No. 669 of the 7th November 1946 suggested to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that a special Judge be appointed to hear these appeals, and a further Note Verbale, No. 304 of the 13th June, 1947 was sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on the same subject. Until now His Majesty’s Government has had no reply from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to either of these Notes Verbales and the appeals of the tenants against the decision of No. 10 Land Settlement Board have not been heard though nearly four years have elapsed since its publication in the Iraq Gazette. 6 . As a result of the case remaining sub judice for so lengthy a period, His Highness the Sheikh of Koweit has suffered grave ped^iiary loss for five successive years. Up to 1942 the tenants of the gardens at Fao paid to the Sheikh his share of the crop. In 1943 and 1944, however, the Sheikh lost the&gt; entire fruits of the gardens which were disposed of clandestinely by the tenants. 6 . In 1946, therefore, His Highness applied for an Attachment order, which was granted by the Court of First / Instance at Basra for that part of the crop which was held under tenancy agreements stipulating that disputes regarding these agreements should be heard by the Courts at Basra. The remainder of the crop was not attached as the Judge at the Court of First Instance at Abu Khasib refused to grant -an attachment order. The produce attached by the Court at Basra was later released against security. The Sheikh of Koweit therefore lost all the profits of the 1946 crop. 7. In 1946 the Court of First Instance at Basra again attached the Sheikh’s share of the crop, but on the eve of the date harvest the Attachment Order was annulled on grounds which caused His Highness’s lawyer to protest to His Excellency the Prime Minister and to the Ministers of Interior and Justice. Nevertheless His Highness lost the / fruitsfruits of the 1947 harvest. 8 . In 1947, His Highness's agent in Basra applied to the Mutasarrif of Basra for sanction to post armed guards around the gardens to prevent the looting of the crop. His Majesty’s Embassy has ascertained that this is a well- established custom in Basra Liwa. This request however was refused by the Mutasarrif on the grounds that under Article 33 of the Land Settlement Law No. 29 of 1938, he was unable to interfere administratively in a case which remained sub judice. Therefore His Highness's agent applied, as in previous years, to the Court of First Instance at Basra for an Attachment Order. This application was refused and His Highness's agent was referred to the Court of First Instance, at Abul Khasib. This reference ignored both the precedent of the previous years and the fact that the Court at Abul Khasib is only competent to hear cases involving less than , 21.500 in value and that the crops liable to attachment far exceed that amount. The Sheikh's lawyer appealed to the Ministry of Justice against the refusal of the attachment order citing Law 27 of 1945. The Ministry gave instructions to the Judge, who reversed his previous Order and attached the crop. His Majesty's Embassy hopes that this Attachment order ^ill not be lifted as has been the case i^n the past. 9. The lengthy delay in the hearing of these appeals and the successfully obstructive tactics employed by the Iw lawyer for the appellants, Saiyid Suleiman Shawaf, constituted a grave reflection on the administration of justice in the Iraqi Courts. This appeal has involved the Sheikh of Koweit in very large losses which he can never recover since the appellants are small tenants quite incapable of making restitution. It will be apparent that these losses will continue until such time as the appeals are finally disposed /off of, and it is therefore in the interests of the good reputation of Iraqi justice that the appeals should be heard without further delay. His Majesty's Embassy has learnt unofficially that a Judge, Saiyid Shaukat di has been appointed to deal with this matter, as requested in Note Verbale No. 669 addressed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by this Embassy on November 7th, 1946. It has oeen learnt, however, that this Judge, who was appointed in the course of July, 1947, has not yet proceeded to Basra. It is very much hoped that he should be instructed to proceed, or alternatively that some other Judge should be appointed. 10. His Majesty's Embassy is certain that with the fore 6 oing facts at their disposal the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will feel able to urge on the competent authorities the necessity of a decision being reached in this case in the very near future.The Political Jigoncy, nQhFIDEKTLiL .

We find that it is rather a long time since we reported to you on this subject. We therefore enclose a copy of an Aide Memoire which we handed in to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 11th September 1948. This Aide Memoire contains a brief history of the case, and its intention is, we think, clear. We propose therefore to continue the story from that point. First of all, the attachment order for the 1947 crop was of of course annulled, in spite of the last sentence of para .8 of the enclosed Aide Memoire. The the Shaikh lost his share of the 1947 crop also. At first, however, some progress was promised in the hearing of the Land Settlement Appeals, which presumably as a result of our Aide Memoire, were transferred from Basra to Bagdad. This transfer seemed full of promise for the Shaikh who was thus enabled to brief Nasrat al Farisi, a lawyer of ability and some influence who has since become Minister in the Sadr cabinet. Unfortunately these appeal cases were transferred bact to Basra by a Ministry of Justice order dated 26th November, 1947. This was probably the result of intrigues by Suleiman Shawwaf, the appellants' lawyer, whose profitable antics have always been a stumbling block to us in this case. With the transfer of the cases back to Basra Nasrat al Farisi felt he could no longer undertake them. On the face of it, however, the transfer was innocuous and we did not feel we could protest, especially since a special Judge with a good reputation, Abdul Qadir Jamil, was transferred from Mosul to deal with the appeals in Basra. In January 1948 we sent another note of enquiry to the Minist ry of Foreign Affairs, and the appeal cases finally came up before Abdul Qadir Jamil on 3rd February. The court was immediately ad journed until 17th February, when the appellants' lawyer contested the court's grouping of the appeals into seven categories and claimed that each of the two thousand seven hundred odd cases should be heard separately. This led to another adjournment, and when the court met again on 26th February in the absence of Sulaiman Shawwaf, the President professed himself dissatisfied with the survey and assessment of the properties carried out on behalf of the Land Settlement Court whose decision was under appeal. Thus the last we have heard about these cases was that during March the President of the Court together with the Land Setllement Officers and Surveyors did a tour of inspection of the gardens under dispute. In the meantime we have had a note' from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in reply to our enquiries, informing us that the appeal cases wre 'taking their normal course.' We fear that this description may turn out to be only too true. But as soon as we can reasonably show that the President's procrastinations are more dubious than usual, we intend to return to the charge with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. You will however realise that when it comes to influencing ministers and Judges we are at a serious dis advantage compared with Sulaiman Shawwaf.

QdA/XBR MB/AD iAIDE MEMOIRS His Majesty's Embassy has for some considerable time been trying to secure a settlement of the question of the Date Gardens of His Highness the Sheikh of Koweit at Fao and now wishes once more to bring to the notice of the Iraqi Government the most unsatisfactory position in which it has for so long been allowed to remain. 2. In 1038 the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs and His Majesty's Embassy exchanged Notes No. 14184/2440/100 of 30th October, 1938 and No. 586 of 1st November, 1938, in which His Majesty&amp;s Government agreed to abide by the provisions of the Land Settlement LaM No. 29 of 1938 for the regulation of the properties of His Highness the Sheikh of Koweit in Iraq. 3* In 1943, No. 10 Land Settlement Board under Judge Good, heard the case of His Highnesses Date Gardens at Fao and his decision in favour of His Highness was promulgated in Iraq Gazette No. 2166 of the 22nd February, 1944. In accordance with the provisions of the Land Settlement Law, 2?64 appeals were lodged in the Land Settlement Appeal Court at Baghdad by Saiyid Suleiman Shawaf, a lawyer acting on behalf of the tenants. 4. During the summer of 194-5* the Land Settlement Appeal Court at Baghdad was closed and the cases transferred to the new provincial Land Settlement Appeal Court at Basra and after many postponements the cases were first called in January and February 194-6. As the Judge of this Court was exceptionally busy and in charge of five other Courts/ British Embassy, Baghdad• 9th September,I - 2 - Courts in the Basra Llira, His Majesty^ Government in their Note Verbale No. 669 of the 7th November 1946 suggested to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that a special Judge be appointed to hear these appeals, and a further Note Verbale, No. 304 of the 13th June, 194? was sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on the same subject. Until now His Majesty^ Government has had no reply from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to either of these Notes Verbales and the appeals of the tenants agAinst the decision of No. 10 Land Settlement Board have not been heard though nearly four years have elapsed since its publication in the Iraq Gazette. 5. As a result of the case remaining sub Judice for so lengthy a period, His Highness the Sheikh of Koweit has suffered grave pecuniary loss for five successive years. Up to 1942 the tenants of the gardens at Fao paid to the Sheikh his share of the crop. In 1943 and 1944, however, the Sheikh lost the entire fruits of the gardens which were disposed of clandestinely by the tenants. 6. In 1945, therefore, His Highness applied for an Attachment Order, which was granted by the Court of First Instance at Basra for that part of the crop which was held under tenancy agreements stipulating that disputes regarding these agreements should be heard by the Courts at Basra. The remainder of the crop was not attached as the Judge at the Court of First Instance at Abu Khasib, refused to grant an attachment order. The produce attached by the Court at Basra was later released against security. The Sheikh of Koweit therefore lost all the profits of the 1945 crop. 7# In 1946 the Court of First Instance at Basra again attached the Sheikh’s share of the crop, but on the eve of the date harvest the Attachment Order was annulled on grounds which caused His Highness’s lawyer to protest to His/3 His Excellency the Prime Minister and to the Ministers of Interior and Justice. Nevertheless His Highness lost the fruits of the 194*6 harvest. 8. In 194-7, His Highness 1 s agent in Basra applied to the Mutasarrif of Basra for sanction to post armed guards around the gardens to prevent the looting of the crop. His Majesty’s Embassy has ascertained that this is a well established custom in Basra Liwa. This request however was refused by the Mutasarrif on the grounds that under Article 33 of the Land Settlement Law No. 29 of 1938, he was unable to interfere administratively in a case which remained sub judlce. Therefore His Highness’s agent applied, as in previous years, to the Court of First Instance at Basra for an Attachment Order. This applica tion was refused and His Highness’s agent was referred to the Court of First Instance at Abul Khasib. This reference ignored both the precedent of the previous years and the fact that the Court at Abul Khasib is only competent to hear cases involving less than ID*500 in value and that the crops liable to attachment far exceed that amount. The Sheikh’s lawyer appealed to the Ministry of Justice against the refusal of the attach ment order citing Law 2? of 194-5* The Ministry gave Instructions to the Judge, who reversed his previous Order and attached the crop. His Majesty’s Embassy hopes that this Attachment Order will not be lifted as has been the case in the past. 9. The lengthy delay in the hearing of these appeals and the successfully obstructive tactics employed by the lawyer for the appellants, Salyid Suleiman Shawaf, constituted a grave reflection on the administration of justice in the Iraqi Courts. This appeal has involved the Sheikh of Loweit in very large losses which he can never/never recover since the appellants are small tenants quite incapable of making restitution. It will be apparent that these losses will continue until such time as the appeals are finally disposed of, and it is there fore in the interests of the good reputation of Iraqi justice that the appeals should be heard without further delay. His Majesty's Bnbassy has learnt unofficially that a Judge, Saiyid Shaukat Sa’di, has been appointed to deal with this matter, as requested in Note Verbale Ho. 669 addressed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by this Embassy on November 7th 194-6. It has been learnt, however, that this Judge, who was appointed in the course of July 194 - 7 , has not yet proceeded to Basra. It is very much hoped that he should be instructed to proceed, or alternatively that some other Judge should be appointed. 10. His Majesty’s Embassy is certain that with the foregoing facts at their disposal the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will feel able to urge on the competent authorities the necessity of a decision being reached in this case in the very near future.rarr~Tr*v;'iJ^ Wo.

We are cheered and encouraged to know that you are keeping a fatherly eye on this business. The present position, I am informed, is that there was a hearing here on the 7th December when Nusrat al Farsi came down from Bagaad to watch the Shaikh's interests. The Shaikh had been asked by the Court to produce proof of ownership of the aate gardens and hmded to the Court a mass of the customary agreements with the cultivators (taabs) by which the latter undertake to tend the gardens in return for a share of the crop. The agree ments shown to the Court covered one year's cultivation. The Court took exception to the agreements because they bore no Revenue stamps, and the Shaikh's representatives had to pay a fine of I.D. 750/- to put this in order. The lawyer for the opposite side, Caiman ash Shawaf, then asked the Court for four or five months' postponement in which to, stuay this evidence but Nusrat al Farsi strongly opposed this application saying that the agreements were quite ordinary and customary, that the opposite side were per fectly familiar with them and already knew all about them, and that no postponement was necessary. The Court there upon fixed January 11th as the date for the next hearing, which is supposed to be the final one before judgment is given. We say supposed to be because the case has gone on so long that the thought of its ever ending becomes incredible. As regards this year's date crop, that has been irrevocably lost. An Attachment Order was granted in August at the request of the Shaikh's representatives but owing to non-cooperation and obstruction on the part of the Execution Department the crop was never attached. On the 15th December one of the taabs applied for the cancellation of the Attachment Order, offering himself to go surety for the whole of the crop, and the Court granted his request despite the perfectly obvious fact that he was a man of no standing whatsoever and not fit to go surety for one-thousandth part of the value of the cropI Hasan Abdur-Rahman, the Shaikh's lawyer, who was in Bagdad at the time, went to the minister of Justice and complained that this was a gross miscarriage of justice, and it is understood that as a result the minister has ordered an Inspector to come to B^tsra to look into the matter. Shaikh kuhammad as-Subah points out that even if the Inspector does come and does report adversely on the Judge who cancelled the attachment order it m 11 not restore the Shaikh of Kuwait's share of the harvest, which has now been removed by the t&amp;abs T nor reimburse him for the expenditure he has incurred for watchmen etc. which he reckons at I.D. 1750/-.

The maintenance of friendly relations between Iraq and Kuwait must inevitably be rendered more difficult by the continued postponements of the hearings of these appeals, amounting in effect to a denial of justice by an Iraqi Court.

AL AHMED AS SUBAH, BASRA. *** ( I have the honour to inform Your Highness that the Fao case is to be heard on 3.5.49. Itere-al si Faresi, the lawyer has not come from Baghdad, because he was ill and our lawyer Hasan Abdulrahman atten ded the Court alone. The Chief of the Court put up so many questions to our lawyer which were irrelevant, as if he was opponent. When our lawyer came out of the Court he was disappointed with the finding of the Court and the way they deferred with different excuses, as you can see from the copy of the letter received from the lawyer, enclosed herewith (I have given the original letter^ received from the lawyer to the British Consul General, Basra, on the next day of the hearing of the case and explained to him in detail the action of the Chief Judge (chief of the Court) against us); I wish to add that the Chief Judge tes asked us to bring the original guarantees given by H.M.G. to as Subah for the protection of their property, as Your Highness can see from the letter received from the lawyer. I therefore request Your Highness to order the original guarantee of H.M.G. to as Subah, to be sent to me in Basra, so that we can show it to the Chief Judge, and I shall return it to you. I requestthis document nay reach me before 17.5.49 as the case will be heard on the 17th. r\Translation of copy of letter dated 3/5/49 from Hasan Abdulrahman, the lawyer, Basra, to Shaikh Moh*d al '“timed as Subah, Basra. Today v\as the day for hearing the cases which were appealed by the farmers against your father, H.H. Shaikh Ahmed al Jabir as Subah and his co-sharers,the heirs of Shaikh Jabir Abdullah as Subah, the 1st ruler of Kuwait. The Chief Judge of the Court began with taking down the statement of Abdulmajeed Abdul Sayed, the engineer of the Land Settlement, of how he drew the maps of these plots. He also asked him about th£ I report of the experts dated 29.6.41 which included the estimation of the ages of the date palm trees in the plots. He i explained to him the stages of the ages of the trees according to this report and another report submitted later. The second report stated that the trees were to be classified and divided into two classes, first, those ( who were between 10 and 30 years old and second, those above 30 years old. The Chief Judge then decided to take from out some of the communications e£/the file of the Land Settlement Committee and put them* on the file of the Court. Those communications were:- 1. The report dated 29.6.41 submitted by experts about the age of-2 - the palm trees. 2. Land Settlement Committee^ letter No.110^ dated 11.12.40 addressed to Messrs, as Subah, showing that there were some difficulties ijn knowing the names of the persons of as Subah who were having free hand of the'said property, so that the Committee would be able to have them registered in their names. 3. The minute of the Survey dated 21.9.41. 4. Letter dated 23.8.41 signeu by Abdul Jabil Bertu, the general lawyer of as Subah, addressed to the Head of Land Settlement Committee, stating that his clients, the heirs of Shaikh Mubarak as Suba , claim the ownership of all plots of Fao which is inside the following land marks: WEST NORTH - Khor Abdullah - The river between this I plot and A1 A'me'r date garden, which is the property of the heirs of Nasir Pasha as Sadan. SOUTH - the sea EAST - Shatt-al-Arab and this is the plot that his clients are claiming its ownership. 5. Letter dated 27.9.41 from Tapu Department, Basra, addressed to the Head of the Committee in reply to their letter, stating that the lands of plot No.6 of Fao Naheyat, which after referring to the register of the original free hand of the heirs of Shaikh• 3 . Mubarak as Subah, appears it is not registered in Tapu Department. 6. The Court had also received f a letter No.1062 dated 16.4.49 from Qayei^akan of Abulkhaseeb, with a secret letter No.254 dated 28.2.39 addressed to the Mutasarrifiyah of BasraX Liwa and also the letter from the Mutasarrifiyah of Basra Liws, No. 4593 dated 29.3.49 with letter No.26200 dated 23.12.43 from the Ministry of Interior, forming an enclosure to it. . A]1 these documents were keut in the file of the Court. The original document of the settlement dated Rabi Thani, 1362 countersigned by the Mejlis Idara of Basra Liwa on 14th June - and when the Chief of the Court examined the document, he found out that the copy submitted to the Court before and examined by H.E. the Political Agent, Kuwait, is a true copy and agrees with it. So he returned the original document to me and was satisfied with the copy submitted to him. I then returned the document to you to send it back to H.H. your father. While expecting the Court to announce the final decision in this case after having been under considera tion for such a long time, I was sur prised to hear questiors put up to me by the Chief Judge (chief of the Court) who asked me whether I counter sign and agree to all what Mr. Good, former Head of Land Settlement. 4 . Committee , had arranged regarding the classification of Fao land into the following plots of land:- Plot of Land No.. (21): Area 1026 d-noms and 6 oiks (legal property) in 'he name of Shaikh Jabir Abdullah as Subah, the 1st Ruler of Kuwait. Plot No.0'2): Area 3387 Danoms and 24 oiks, (Ameereya property, planted r before publishing the law of having free hand 'by which the Tapu authorized Shaikh Jabir bin Abdullah al Subah, 1st ^ ruler of Kuwait. Plot of land No.(23): Area 275 danoms and 17 oiks (Amereyah land, re- authorised 'by Tapu and its plants are new and were planed after the issue of the law of having free hand of non- transferable property and in the theabovementioned name of/Shaikh Jabir.) Plot of land No(24): Area 11 danoms and 20 oiks (Amereyah land, reauthorised by Tapu and its plants ^ are newly planted,i.e., after the jssue of the law of having a free hand, in the name of the abovementioned Shaikh Jabir) , Plot of Land No.(25): Are 629 danoms and 7 oiks (Amereyah land authorised by Tapu, its trees were planted after the issue of the law of having free hand, reregistered in the name of Shaikh Jabir bin Abdullah al Subah). Plot of land No.(26): Area 3244 danoms and 3 oiks (Amereyah authorised by Tapu, its trees were- planed5 after the issue of the law of having a free hand, re-registered in the name of XX2&amp; Shaikh Jabir bin Abdullah al Subah). Plot cf land (28): Area 9 oik and 93 square meters authorised by Tapu \ planted before the issue of the law of having a free hand and were re-registered in the name of Shaikh Jabir bin Abdullah al Subah), I replied saying that I confirm that the Fao mx area bounded by &lt; Khor Abdullah on the West and on North by the river separating it from al-Amir and by Shat-al-Arab, on the East and by the sea on South, all of it, belongs to the heirs of Shaikh Jabir bin Abdullah as Subah, who are at present, H.H. Shaikh Ahmed al Jabir as Subah and his colleagues, the heirs whose names are mentioned in the document of the Legal Distribution which is sikbrnitted, I do not wish to add anything else at present, • H. E, the Chief Judge (chief of the Court) insisted upon having a reply given to the Court about the said plots of land, as they are arranged above, and whether I agree to that arrangement xx or not. a delay I asked for/xKttgg so that I may discuss it w 7 ith you. The Chief cf the Court has also decided to have the area re-examined and the age of the plants be guassed again as it seems to me that he does not consider the guess made by the• 6. experts during Mr. Good ! s time, the former Chief cf the Committee of Land Settlement. He asked me to arrange / with Salman Shawaf, the opponents lawyer, to appoint experts to guess the age of the palm trees. I refused to agree and he wanted to enforce Article 17 (para 2 B) and he asked me to appoint an expert to represent H.H. your father and his colleagues, when the age of the palm tree is to he guessed. I asked for a delay to select such expert. The case was postponed to the 17th May, 1949^ during which period the investigation should be completed and the age of the treeS/guessed. * , The lawyer of the opronent, asked for a delay also, so that he may announce the name of the expert who will represent them in guessing the age of the palm trees. The Chief of the Court will appoint a third expert to bring the number of the experts to three. The opponents lawyer asked for „ delay (for 3 or 4 times) in order to be able to reply the Court's question regarding the thumb impress and signsture3on the documents which we presented to the Court against the farmers, whether they were their thumb impressiongs and signatures or not. In this sessions he did not reply and he asked for a delay for the fifth time.Strange enough, his request was accepted by the Court and he was granted the delay.' Remark I forgot to mention in my letter above that the Chief of the Court has*also asked me to submit to the Court The guarantee given by Government of Iraq and the Govt. i of Occupation to al Subah authorising thejrf/ ‘“lereyah lands in which are in their possession according to para 1 of Article 1 of the law of modification of the Law of Settlem nt No.26 of 1941 which was published -- ,, Ahookayea ,, al Iraqia No.1896 d'ated 1.4.41. I have perused the law of countersigning of the treaty concluded between Iraq and Great Britain on 30th June 1930, No.5 of 1931, where it is stated in Article 8 of that -treat as follows: (and that if any of these resnonsibilities regain, it is, for H.H. King of Iraq alone to - and' the article continue to state 'all remaining responsibilities of H.B.M. concerning Iran in accordance with another international document, it should also be the responsibility of the King cf Iraq. The two signatories should take the necessary steps for the transfer of these responsibilities to H.H. King of Iraq). It is therefore necessary to produce the guarantee given to al Subah on the subject of authority. I wish to add that I supported Nasrat al Faresi*s point of view that it is not necessary./~V to produce this guarantee and that para 2 of part B of Article 10 proves that the registration is sound and this is supported by the existenceof documents justifying its re-registration in the names of the persons sqqsxiM appealed against, but the Court insisted that the guarantee must be produced to them. I therefore request you to send me this document if it is form existing whether jfox in gxxjcM of a private agreement or an addendum^ to a treaty - please refer to where it is. I r\Routine note. The case stands as under: A committee of 'experts’ 1 appear to have been appointed by the President of the Basra Court of Appeal for uhe purpose of accessing the age of the date palm trees. These experts have been rejected by Shaixh Mhd. because! of their inexperience and secondly as they appear to be the nominees of the lawyer Salman ash Shawaf. Despite this protest the President accompanied by the 'experts' are reported to have spent three days in some of the date gardens under dispute at Abadan, after which the palm trees we*re pronounced to be younger than stated arxct thereby attempting to prove to the Court that, considering their age - v/hich varied from 10 to 5 years - these could never ha be been planted by the Subah family ' years and years ago'. ( 3 98 para 2 refers. ) Accordingly Shaixh Mhd was informed by the President of the Court that the lands in question were G-ovt. ’Miri 1 lands and as such non-Iraqis could not own such properties in Iraq and went on to say that the Court would considerr (&lt;n&gt; ' 2 consider the lands as. rightfully owned by the farmers unless evidence was produced before the dourt by the SheiKh of Kuwait authorising him to own such prooerties, and which evidence the Cxovt. of Iraq were bound to accept. It is presumed that the agreement referred to signed ^ is that betwwen HMG- and the Sheikh of Kuwait/as far back as 1914. As a result of some action taken by the Embassy i jjBaghdad it would appear that the Minister of Justice intimated the President of uhe Court of Appeal that in view of the £ovt. of Iraq respecting this agreement referred to, there was no necessity of the document being produced in the original in Court. This action appears to have upset the President who hxa is reported to be appealing to the Ministry of Justice ( 3100 para 2. ) against such intervention. According to Shaiish Mhd. it would appear that Tie prejudice of the President of the Court of Appeal is so obvious that he considers the case as good as lost^/ thoughjlater he he is reported to have staked that if one opinion ff the experts holds good 85 7 ° of the property would be in their favour, i S'/f* /V1&gt;$£\ KUWAIT GOVERNMENT SECRETARIATE Ref. 'K.o. KUWAl T, 22nd. May.^A9^ Kuwait. Dear Sir, I am directed 'by His Highness to send you herewith copy of a letter ££ orn Sheikh Mohammed in connection wiun^the Foa case, for your perusal. Your s Jfo.Ztfip6.ll y , Vy,, •^l\\The chief judge has decided to re-inspect the Fao for the purpose of estimating the age of the palm trees. He in fact has appointed one man on behalf of the Chief judge and one on the behalf of the farmers and a third man on our behalf. The two men appointed on behalf of the court and the farmers are the clients of SAIi.-IAN 3HAV/AF the lawyer and he has selected them, in agreement with the chief judge. This is a new tric£ and it is sisscz a clear prepossession by the chief judge, although we protested against the new inspection and the conjecture, because Fao had been inspected so many times before the age of the trees has been conjectured during ex- chief judge Mr. G-ood’s time and everything was completed. He refused to accept our demand and we tried to convince him in many ways, but he rejected' and insisted that the inspection should be carried out and the conjecture too ( the age of the trees to be estimated ). The lawyer states that this is a new trich by the chief judge and Salman Shawaf, the lawyer, and this purpose is to conjecture the ages of the trees less than what their ages are. For example, a tree which is 30 years old, they will conjecture its age as 10 years or less so that the property will become Amireyia land and be handed over to the farmers as their own property, because they are Iraqis and had planted the trees and as-Subah are foreigners who have no right -go possess any property. In fact we went out on Saturday the 14th lay 1949, with the ex )erts although we had protested against thealthough we had protested against the experts selected by the court and Sulaiman Shawaf, the lawyer, as ^hey are S. Shawaf T s clients and followers. - l /e acrx told the chief judge that there are so many land lords in Basra, he could select any one of them, but he refused and insisted that we have to go out with these experts who are Salman Shawaf’s followers. We want out to Bao and they began conjecturing the ages of the tall trees, from 30 years and below, and the short trees, from 12 jc years and below, although we have not planted any trees and the last planting of the trees of Mohaweel al-3hattaneya was in 1340 Hyreya (1921) (Alma haweel) and this is well known to all land lords, but the chief judge did not accept our statement although ohe age of a palm tree is mown by counting the roots of the palm isxKg: branches, as the palm tree gives one branch a year and when this branch is cut the root is left there. This fact is well Known to all Ivlallakas ( land lords ) and requires no dispute about it. But we cannot do anything with the chief judge and his agreement with Salman Shawaf the lawyer. Thus the lawyer states that if our friends, HMG will not interfere to protect out rights accordingly to justice, we will loose the Fao property, or the southern part of Bao. This is the lawyer T s opinion and we leave the matter to Your Highness T opinion. I had requested Your Highness in my previous letter to let me have the original guarantee given by HL'O torAl Subah for the Iprotectieniof as ••Subah property. I have not received thethe reply yet. I therefore request Your Highness to instruct that the original document (guarantee) so tliat v/e should not give them a chance. The case has been postponed to the 26th May, 1949, until the inspection is completed.m - ■ ho. 7bl 24/l/l-C. , te-Oonerelj. British Cpnsulat Basra, May 24th, 1949. (Dear Richmond), Vith reference to my letter f«o, 662 (24/l/l-C) of the 5th ay about the Shaikh of Kuwaiti Date Gardens at Fao, I have now received from the Shaikh *s lawyer Hassan Abdurrahman a copy of a report, in Arabic, which he has addressed to the Shaikh on Kay 3rd giving an account of the Basra Appeal Court proceedings of that date, with a copy to Hasrat al Farsi in Bagdad, The report has been translated in our Information Office and I am enclosing a copy of it herewith, in case you may find it of inter est. The part that concerns us most is the postscript he has added under the heading of 'Remarks”, .* in which Hassan Abdurrahman says the President of the | Court of Appeal has demanded production of the under taking guaranteeing to the Shaikh the possession and use of his lands in Fao, I do not know what ”under- taking document given by the Iraqi Government or by the Government of Occupation to Al Subah” the President has in mind, unless it is the famous undertaking by which the British Government, about the end of 1914 I think it was, guaranteed to the Shaikh of Kuwait the possession of his date gardens in the Basra Wilayst free of taxation etc. This undertaking I unfortunately cannot locate in our archives, though surely it must exist somewhere. In the view of the Bmbassyj was any part of the British Governments liability under that undertaking transferred to the Government of Iraq under the 1930 Treaty? The guarantee of exemption from taxation was of course allowed to lapse and a lump-sum compensation was paid, but was that the end of the whole undertaking? I should like to know what our official view is. I am sending copies of this letter to Sir Rupert Hay and to Jackson with copies of the enclosure. (Yours ever), (Sd.) A. W. DAVIS. J. C. n. Richmond, i^sq., British Embassy, Mum.-—To H.i3. Sheikh Mohainraod Al Ahmed Al Subah, After greetings and with due respect, This day was the citing date of the cases appealed against by the (Ta'abs) workers in lands against H.H. your Father Sheikh /dimed Al Jaber Al Subah &amp; Co. or partners i.e. the inheritors of the late Sheikh Jaber bin Abdullah al Subah First Governor of Kuwait in which case H.S. the President of the Court began taking the evidence of the architect of the Land Settlement Commission, Abdul Majid Abdul Saiyid, in connection with the plans drawn by him of the various pieces of lands under dispute, he also questioned him about the report submitted by the experts dated 29*6.1941, comprising their estimation of the age of the date palm trees in the strips of lands. He made it clear to him the various ages of the palm trees, in accordance with that report and another report which followed it. The second report classified the date palms in two categories, 1st category estimated the trees bos tween 10 to 30 years, the second category anything over 30 years. The President then decidedto take out some correspondence from the Land Settlement Commission .files and adding same to the Court file concerning this case, namely the report by experts on the age of date palm trees dated 29.6.41 and a letter from the Land Settlement Comnission No.110 datedll t 12.1940 addressed to Messrs. Al Subah comprising existing difficulties in knowing the names of individuals from Al Subah who were enjoying free hand and making full use of the lands in question to enable the Land Settlement Commission to register it in their names. Aldo the Inspection document dated 21.9*1941. and a letter dated 23 September 1941 signed by the advocate Abdui Jalil Partau, General Procurator of Al Subah, addressed to the Land Settlement Commission, comprising his clients claim i.e. (the Inheritors of Sheikh Mubarak al Subah) were claiming ownership of the whole Fao Muqata’ah which comes under the following boundaries vtest Khor Abdullah - North, the river separating between them and the Mu’amer date groves property of the inheritors of Nasir/-s - 2 - Naeir Pasha Al Sa’doun. Prom the South - 'Uie Sea. Prom the ^ast Shatt-al-Arab. All this Muqata f ah is claimed by his clients as their right property. Also a letter from the Tapu Department Basrah, dated 27*9-1941 addressed to the President of the Land Settlement Commission in reply to its letter comprising that the lands in Muqata’ah No. 6 which comes under Pao Nahiyah and which according to returns in original register were administered by the inheritors of Sheikh Mubarak al Subah but were not registered in Tapu Register. Also a letter received by the Court No. 1062 dated 16.4*1949 from Qaimmaqam Abul Khassib attached to a secret letter No.254 dated 28.2.39(?) addressed to Mutasarrifiya&amp; Basrah Liwa. Also a letter from Mutasarrifiyah Basra Liwa No.4593 dated 29*3*49 enclosing a letter from the Ministry of the Interior No* 26200 dated 23/12/43* All these letters were filed in the Court Pile relating to that case. I have produced to the Court the original Mukharajah document which was dated Rabi-ul-Thani of the year 1322 which was approved and endorsed by the Basrah Administrative Council, on the 14th of June 1320 he found that the copy produced in the past before the Court which was endorsed by the Political Agent in Kuwait was a true copy (genuine) copy, to the original one produced by me, so he returned to me the original document and was satisfied with the copy, and I in my turn return it to you for handing it over to your respected father. While I was hoping that the Court would diffuse some conclusion in this case which has taken long time to settle I was suddenly surprised by a question from the President of Court as follows :- k Do you agree and confirm Mr. Goods separating and partitioning of Pao lands into the following strips Strip No. (21) measuring 1026 Donums &amp; 6 Olgs as (Mulk Sirf) or rightly owned by Sheikh Jabir bin Abdullah Al Subah 1st. Governor of Kuwait. ' 10 %) j-3- 3 trip N o. (22) measuring 3387 Donums and 24 olgs were Miri len^T' (State lands) planted with date trees prior to the publication of the 'Tasarruf Law' were authorised by Tapu deeds to sheikh Jaber bin Abdullah al Subah, first Governor of K u wait« Strip No&gt;(23) measuring 275 donums and 17 olgs were miri lands authorised by Tapu deeds, and that its plantation took place after the publication of the law entitled 'Qanun al Tasarruf bil Amwal ghair manqulah' i«e* disposing with immovable property, its registration was renewed in the name of sheikh Jaber al SubaJu Strip No»(24j measuring 11 donums, and 20 olgs (Miri lands authorised by Tapu) and its plantation took place after the publication of the 'Tasarruf' and newly registered in the name of Sheikh Jabir al Subah. Strip No. (25) - measuring 629 donums and 7 olgs (Miri lands authorised by Tapu) and that its trees were planted after the publication of 'Tasarruf Law' and re-registered afresh in the name of sheikh Jaber bin Abdullah Al Subah. Strip No. (26) - measuring 3244 donums and 3 olgs (Miri lands authorised by Tapu) and that its trees were planted after the publication of 'Tasarruf Law' and re-registered afresh in the name of sheikh Jaber bin Abdullah al Subah. Strip No. (28)- measuring 9 olgs and 97 square metres, autho rised by Tapu and its trees were planted prior to the publica tion of 'Tasarruf' Law' were registered afresh in the name of Sheikh Jabir bin Abdullah Al Subah. I replied that I confirm that the Pao Muqata’ah bounded from the West by Khor Abdullah. Prom the North the river separating between them and the Mu’amer date groves property of the inheritors of Nasir Pasha al Sa’doun. Prom the South, the Sea. and from the East Shatt-al-Arab. The whole of this Muqata’ah belong to the inheritors of Sheikh Jabir bin Abdullah al Subah# and who are at present the following owners:- H.H. Sheikh Ahmed Al Jaber Al Subah and the other inheritors his partners whose names was given in the 'Qassam al Shar'i' orShara* partitioning document already submitted and have nothing further to add on it. The President of the Court persisted to the necessity for me to give him a reply to the above questions about these strips as classified and whether I am prepared to confirm its classification nr not? So I asked the President to allow me some time until I consult you before giving the reply. The president of the Court decided also that a new inspec tion of the whole Muqata*ah be made, and a new assessment be made into the age of the trees, and date trees. I gather from this that he feels rather suspicious about the previous report submitted by experts, in the time of Mr.Good late president of the Land Settlement Commission. He imposed upon me and upon my antagonist advocate Salman al Shawwaf that each of us should select an expert, for fresh assessment of the ages of palm trees, • but I refused to agree, and was going to enforce the Article 17 para 2 b. of the Land Settlement Law, and asked me to appoint one expert to represent H.H. the Smir (Emir) the father and his partners, for re-assessment of the ages of the date trees, so I asked him for a grace to enable me to consult you so that you may select this expert and the case was deferred to 17«5*1949» and that the inspection and the re-assessment of the ages of date trees be completed within the grace period. The agent of my antagonist has also obtained grace to select a new expert to represent the workers in re-assessing the ages of the date trees, and that the President of the Court shall select a third expert of his own, so altogether there will be 3 experts on this job. The agent of my opponent was given grace for the third and fourth time so as to reply to the Court to a question about the finger prints and signatures in the documents submitted against the workers (Ta’abbin) and whether they were their true % finger prints and signatures or not? But he failed to answer in this sitting, and was given grace for the fifth time. But it seems strange that the Court consented to give him grace for the 5th time in succession.-5- (2£A) y# ^ It is requested therefore that after carefully studying this my letter, is to give me the name of the new expert you may like to appoint, so that he may join the two other experts in the re-assessment of the ages of the date trees. Please inform me also whether you agree to iny giving a reply to the President of the Court confirming the partitioning carried out in the time of Mr* Good or not,or whether you have aiay other opinion affecting this partitioning, or whether my reply to the Court was sufficient, and I must persist upon it and to add nothing further. Please accept my warm respects* Yours Sincerely, Advocate Hassan Abdul Rahman, Basrah, dated 3*5*1949 Copy to;~ The Advocate Nasrat al Farsi for his information. R11MARKS. I omitted to mention above that H.K. the President of the Court has asked me also to produce before the Court the undertaking document given by the Iraqi Government, or by the Government of Occupation to Al Subah authorising them possession of Miri or (State lands) for their use in accordance to para(l) of Article (1) of the Amendment of the Land Settlement Commission Law.No* 26 for the year 1941 published in the Iraq Government Gazette under Serial No. 1895 dated 1.4.41. On the understanding that I have gone through the Anglo-Iraq Treaty concluded between Great Britain and Iraq signed on the 30th of June 1930 No.5 dated 1931 and found in the Art. 8 of that Treaty the following remarks (if anything remains of these responsibilities it is for the King of Iraq to settle alone). In another place it says any other undertakings by H•M.The King of Great Britain it is for the King of Iraq to decide. And it is for both parties to see fortwith and take necessary measures to gar an tee the trans fer/.transfer of such responsibilities to the care of h.M. The King of Iraq. Under these circumstances I do not see any harm in submitting these undertakings to the Court, although I sided with Nasrat al Pars! that there was no need to their submission and that para (2) of Section (b) of Art. (10) garanteed the genuine registration of such documents, but the Court persisted in seeing these documents. It is requested therefore that you may please send me these documents if it existed or whether it was a special undertaking or an addendum to a Treaty, is to mention its whereabout.With the Compliments of His Majesty's Consul-General /f.

(Deer Arthur), With reference to *iy letter 761 (24/1/1-C) of the 24th - ay to Richiuona about the Chaikh of huvait , s date gardens at Fao, as I told you by telephone this morning I have just had another visit from Shaikh fcuheimad as Subah who is very harassed and worried indeed. He tells me that the President of the i^asra Court of Appeal went down to Fao and spent three days there looking at some of the gardens in dispute. He appointed some 'experts 11 to decide the age of the date- palms in these gardens* all these 'experts' were nominees of the lawyer of the opponents, Salman ash Shawwef, Shaikh Luhammad as Cuban protested and asked that real experts from the big date-growing families of Hasra such as the Haqibs, Bashayans end Zuhairs should be n&amp;aineted instead but the President would not hear of it, with the result that the 'experts' pronounced date-palms fifty years old to be ten years old, and those twenty years old to be five years old, ! the intention being to prove to the Court that they [] had not been planted by the Subah family years aid ** years ago. Finally, the President of the Court told Shaikh i. uhammad as Subah that all the lana in question was Government 'kiri' land, that non-Iraqis could not own agricultural 'ixiri' properties in Iraq, and that there fore the taabs would be held by the Court to be the true owiners unless the Shaikh of Kuwait could produce in Court before June 2nd an original treaty or agree ment binding on the Iraq Government providing a firm basis whereby the Shaikh of Kuwait is by way of exception authorised to own such properties in Iraq. Shaikh kuhammad asked for a longer time but the President firmly rejected ell his requests for ad journment t the 2nd June is the last date. The only treaty or agreement of uiiich I have any knowledge which might hrve any bearing on the case is the agreement betvjeen the British Government and the Shaikh of Kuwait which was made about the time war broke out between Turkey and Great Britain in November 1914. The original text of that is presumably in Kuwait, and Shaikh kuhammad has aksed his father to send it to Basra, ^ut there is a possibility that it may arrive late, or that he may not wish such a valuable document to pass out of his own safe keeping.

Particulars by mail.” Here axe the details of our request to you to send us the document of the guarantee: The Land Settlement Committee of Basra, when land-surveying Fao palm trees, they classifieid them into two classes, having considered one of them as Amereyia land and the other as mere proper ty. They authorised us to have the Amerevia land and registered it in our names, because the Chief Judge was an Englishman and he probably knew about the guarantee given by the British G-overnment to as Subah Family, thus they authorised us to have the Amereyea land and had it registered in our names. But when the farmers counter-appealed the judgment, they protested against the judgment and the authorisation because we are foreigners and are not entitled to be authorised to Amereyia land according to the Iraqi Law. Our lawyers did their very best to the fact that we are of the foreigners to whom the British Government have given a guaran tee to have the right of being authorised to have the Amereyia land m Basra Liwa, depending on MiG’s guarantee to the late Shaikh Mubarak as Subah. Thus the Chief Judge asked and insisted upon seeing the original guarantee. Our lawyer’s opinion is that we should bring the guarantee at any rate and if we will not present the guarantee, the Chief Judge will pass a judgment against us according to Iraq uaw and we will lose the case. I therefore request Your Highness in case you do not agree to send the guarantee document, to communicate with the authorities concerned and ask them to make the Iraq Government understand that it is not necessary to present this document and to erplain to the Chief Judge that the rights authori sing the Amereyia land property in Basra Liwa concerns all heirs of tne late Shaikh Mubarak as Subah. The hearing of the case has been postponed to 2nd June, 1949 for the purpose of bringing this original guarantee so that the Chief „'udge may see it. I understand that the Chief Judge will pass a judg ment against us in case we fail to produce the said guarantee. I have already met HMG's Consul General, Basra, and explained to him fee- in details.

I received a further report on the subject from Tandy, who was the then Political Agent, Kuwait, but unfortunately we were dealing at the same time with the payment of compen sation for the Bashiya Garden, vide my letter to you No.45(53/11) of the 6th May, 1948, and the bigger question of obtaining a general discharge of our liabilities was overlooked. I now enclose a copy of the latest report received from Tandy from which it appears that we might have to offer the Shaikh as much as £400,COO. 2. Would you kindly let me know if it is still desired that we pursue this proposal? If so, I think we should adopt the course that Tandy has suggested and ask the Shaikh whether he would be willing to negotiate for the discharge of our liabilities in return for a lump sura payment. We need not perhaps mention any specific percentage but we should make it clear that we do not propose to pay him the full value of the gardens which will remain his property as long as the Iraqi authorities recognise them as such.

The Aide ic&amp;aoire enclosed with our letter under reference elicited from the Iraqi Ministry of 5»oreign Affairs a reply to our previous notes on the subject. The Ministry merely tried to explain the long delays in the hearing of the case in the Land Settlement Ai*peal Court, and added that the appeals had •‘reached their final stages” and that we should be informed of the Court* a decision. Soon afterwards we heard from H.M. Consul- General, Basra that the Judge had requested the sheikh's lawyer in Basra to produce by the 2nd June, when the Court was due to sit again, the agreement by which the Iraqi Government had undertaken to except the sheikh of Kuwait from the general mile that non-Iraqis could not hold miri lands in Iraq. Palling this, the Judgment would have to go in favour of the* appellants. We immediately got*in touch with Nasrat al Farisi, the sheikh's lawyer in Bagdad, we shall try to give you as briefly as possible a description of the state of the cases at that time, as far as we understand the matter. If you will refer to (a) Mr. Bateman's Note to the Minister for Foreign Affairs No. 347 of the 8 th July, 1936, a copy of which was sent to you with his despatch No. 358 of the 16th July, 1936, (b) the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs' Note to sir Maurice Peterson No. 14184/2440/100 of the 30th October, 1938, a copy of which was sent to you with his despatch No. 543 of the 3rd November, 1938, and (c) the Embassy^ Note No. 586 of the 1st November, 1938, to the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs, you will see that we agreed to abide by the provisions of Land settlement Law No. 29 of 1938 for the regulation of the sheikh's properties in Iraq. It seems to have been assumed that Article 10 (b) and (c) of that Law would apply to the sheikh*s properties# that is that they would be Miri Land granted in Tapu. This part of the Law reads as follows:- “Article 10.-(b) Land shall be classified as Miri granted in Tapu Eastern Department f Foreign Officet LONDON S.V.l. (i) if it is so recorded in the Tapu registers) (ii) if documentary evidence Justifying its mujaddad registration is forth coming. (lit) if it has been planted for not less than 10 years with not less than 40 trees (in which term are included date-trees and vines) per donum, provid that the average number of the trees shall be taken into consideration and * that the age of most of them shall not be less than 10 years and that the /numbernumber of fruit-bearing trees shall not be less than 20 per donum# (iv) ir the usufruct has been enjoyed by a person or his successor and it has been used productively in accordance with local agricultural practice for a period of not less than 10 years prior to the Settlement decision relating to it and is still being so used by him and no land rent lias been paid thereon during the said period. Subject to para.(d) of Article 6 of this Law, Tapu land shall be registered in the name of j- the person in whose name it is recorded in the Tapu registers; or (ii) the person who produces documentary evidence Justifying registration in his name; or (iii) the person who fulfils the conditions laid down in (3) and ( 4 ) of para (b) above.' (c) (i) Article l of Law No. 26 of 1941 amended Land Settlement Law No. 29 of 1938 as follows Article 1 .- ( 1 ) The word 'Iraqi' shall be added before the word 'person' set out in paragraph (c) (iii) of Article 10 of Land Settlement Law No.29 of 1938. f (*/) The provision of the preceding paragi’aph shall not apply to foreigners to whom the Govemra* nt h«s previously undertaken to grant ifiri land within Basra Liwa.' . * n ? ote No. 1176/1176/100/10247 of the 24th August, 1941, the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs confirmed ^QA? lr J!?? han ^£ 0rnWttlllB ' that Article 1 ^2) Of Law No .26 of 1941 amending the Land Settlement Law No. 29 of 1938 Is intended to coyer the Sheikhs of ruwait and iiuhasnarah, and at there is nothing in the Law to affect the arrangements agreed upon in Mr. Bateman 1 s Note No. 347 of the 6 th July. . t 2v. th t,!? relgn ^^ter and the Minister’s Note in reply of the 30th October 1938'. 4 * This would seem to put the .heikh of Kuwait on the right side of the law, but as far as we understand it, the Judge may find a second difficulty under Article 10(b) (Mi) of the Land Settlement Law. The material date by which the age of the trees has to be Judged is the date of proclamation of Land settlement in any given year, in this case 1939. Por the land to be Kiri granted in Tapu, therefore, the trees on the land must have been not less than 10 years old in 1939. A committee of 'experts' has recently estimated the age of the trees, and in some cases their estimation falls short of the age necessary for the land to be granted as Miri in Tapu. The Judge may, therefore, maintain that this part of the land cannot be Miri granted in Tapu but only Miri Sirf or Laism *• Land held in L&amp;zaa cannot be granted to a non-Iraqi; this is not covered by Article 10 of Land settlement Law No. 29 of 1936, or by Article 1 (2) of the amendment Law No.26 of 1941, or there lore by the guarantee quoted above. There are a number of other legal difficulties also.3^ As a result ol‘ our discuss Iona with himf It appears that Nasrat al faritii went to the Ulnlstry of just ce and had them bring to the judge’s attention the guarantee which the Iraqis gave us in connexion with the Amendment Law* The Judge seemed to be somewhat surprised at this new turn* and at the 2nd June session of the Court he merely postponed the matter until June 14th for a final decision. On J'inc 14th the case was again adjourned to the 23rd June * and now we gather that there is to be a lurther postponement. There is nothing more we can do except await the outcome of the appeals. It looks as if the Judge is determined to do everything he can to take part of these properties away -.rom the dheikh of Kuwait. If the decision is unfavourable to the sheikh we shall have to consider whether it is worth His Highness’s while to appeal to the Court of Cassation. By article 26 (b) of the Luna settlement Law a judgment given by the Special Court is subject to Cassation ' on points ox’ law only”. ie are sending copies of this letter to Bahreini Kuwait and riaara.

We are attracted by tbe prospect of not Goncern ourselves in detail with the difficulties continually encountered by the Sheikh in respect of these date gardens. We doubt however whether the Treasury would be prepared to consider paying the Sheikh anything in the nature of £400,000 to obtain the Sheikh’s agreement to release us from the pledge given in 1914 by His Majesty’s Government, unless we could show conclusively that there was a very real risk that the Sheikh may be deprived of all the Fao gardens by litigation and that we should have to pay full compensation for them.

In today*s sitting on the Foa case, and in the presence of our Counsel Messrs. Nasrat al Farsi and Hasan Abdul Rahman, the Chief Judge announced the Decree,which is against us and runs to this effect :~ Garden No. 21 of the Foa goes to the Sabahs as per Settlement Order given by Mr.Good.This piece includes'almost the whole of the northern farm. Of gardens Nos.22 and 28 of the Foa, which include the long palm-trees of the northern farm and part of the southern farm which had its trees planted before the Disposal Law, only the shares of Your Highness are preserved as, the Decree runs, the Sabahs are foreigners and H.B.M.*s Government’s Undertaking applies only to Your Highness and not to the other members of the Sabah family. Gardens Los.24,25 and 26 of the Foa, comprising the important section including the central and southern farms, the Decree allotts to the farmers on the assumption that these pieces are Emiriya lands and the farmers are Iraqis while the Sabahs are foreigners. As to the Undertaking given by H.B.M.*s Government to the late Sheikh Mubarak,it was taken by the Court to apply only to your Highness and therefore the rest of the Sabahs are to be excluded.This,my Lord, is an obvious injustice, since while the Undertaking by H.B.M. *s Government includes all heirs in the Sabah family the Court took it only to apply to part of the palm-trees which belongs to Your Highness ,and deprived the other members of the Sabah family of their inler- itence on the basis that they are foreigners who are not entitled to possess Emiriya lands. I should therefore beg You,my Lord, to arrange for putting things right before they become out of control. Our Counsel have decided to lodge an Appeal, and they request that the Iraqi Government be approached by the British authorities concerned who will explain to the Government that the Undertaking applies to all heirs in the Sabah family. In the meanwhile I shall , my Lord, send You for Your perusal a copy of the Decree as soon as it is to hand.I am also v/aiting for further instructions form Your Highness, and will be glad to come to Kuwait for any explanations Your Highness may wish to have.Bo. Id &lt;13 (24/1/1-C). British Consulate-General, Basra, July 15th, 1949 . (Bear Arthur), * &amp;ith reference to our telephone conversation of Monday last, July 11th, on the subject of the Shaikh 01 Kuwait's Bate Gardens at Fao, I regret to inform you that things have gone very much as we anticipated. Shaikh Muhammad as Subah came to see me on Wednesday, the 13 th July. He informed me that the case has come up for hearing on the 12th July and the President of the Court of appeal had give judgment. i»usrat al Farsi came down from Bagdad to Basra for the occasion. When Judge Good was in charge of Land Settlement here the date gardens in dispute were divided into three categories. The President’s judgment dealt with each category separately. Plot Lo. 21 of a little over 1026 ddnums was, he decided, the property of all the Subah heirs and was to be registered forthwith in their name. Plots Imos. 22 and 2 B, about 3^00 dbnums altogether, which were planted over 28 years ago i.e. prior to the enactment of the law that foreigners may not hold agri cultural lands in Iraq, were, the President decided, exempt fcom the operation of that law only in so far as the personal share of the Ruling Shaikh himself in person is concerned. His share was therefore to be registered in his name; the rest was to be registered in the name of t e ta&amp;fos« The Shaikh’s share in these plots is a very small one. Finally, Plots Los. 24. 25 and 26, about 6,000 d 8 nums in all, were, in the President’s decision, not Subah property at all. They were to be registered in tne name of the taab s« A copy of the written judgment is unfortunately not available yet. It may be a month or so before it is coiuuunicated to the Shaikh’s representatives. Shaikh Muhammad as Subah has promised to let me have the text as soon as it is available. / Shaikh Muhammad says the President of the Court / of Appeal ruled that the agreements vdth the taab s which I were put in as evidence of ownership were inadmissible because they were given under duress aid were therefore not legally binding on the taab s. This applied equally to those agreements which were executed before a Rotary Public ad those not so executed. ^ Shai nhfid also points out that the- agree ment with his Majesty’s Government guaranteed the lands ktXj , by ShaikhJTaMr in ±914, not those held by Shaikh Ahmad In 1949. Owing to the number of successions which have occurred with resultant partitioning between heirs un der Islamic law the share of Shaikh Ahmad is only a fract ion of Shaikh Jabir’s holding.

The points set out in this despatch refer to matters dealt with in the minute, without further explanation. The Bheikh of Kuwait and his co-heix‘8 of the Al Sub ah family have been awarded the full title to one of the seven plots into which the estate is divided, that is to about one eighth of the area to which they wsre given title by the Te^fh Land Settlement Committee in 1943. The Sheikh himself has been given a share in about half the rest of the estate, but his co—heirs have been excluded. The Sheikh’s lasers are appealing against the decision. The appeal may be heard in the autumn before the Court of Cassation. Under Article 26 (Amended) of the Land Settlement Law, the Court of Cassation can only take into consideration points of law, but the Sheikh’s lawyer informs us that the Court is likely to give this a liberal interpretation. The lawyer first proposes to argue that the 1904 Bill of Commission is sufficient documentary evidence to justify registration of the land in the name of the whole family (Al Subah) in accordance with paragraphs (b)(ii) and (c)(ii) of Article 10 of the Land Settlement Law. If this is admitted the question of the nationality of the family or of guarantees made to them would not arise. If the plea fails, the lawyer will take up the question of Article 1 ( ii) of the Amendment to the Land Settlement Law in the light of the interpretation placed upon it In the letter addressed recently by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Court. This is the question with which His Majesty’s Government is principally concerned. extent of His Majesty’s Government’s guarantee to the Sheikh of Kuwait in 1914. First, it appears, pr&amp;iaa facie , that it must be held to be limited to gardens then in possess ion of Sheikh jrubarak and not to gardens then in possession of other members of his family, by inheritance from a common ancestor. The word “descendants' The first question for consideration is the /in The Light Honourable Clement H. Attlee, M.P., etc., etc., etc' / Government 1 s in the guarantee was interpreted in Foreign office letter to the Colonial Office 2.5244/1358/93 of the 19th October* 1929* as being limited to the actual heirs of the Sheikh’s body and excluding collateral successors. The precise proportion of the estate covered by His Uajesty* s Goverar- ment’s guarantee* in accordance with the above two interpretations, cannot be ascertained without some difficulty, since the shares of the original estate are divided into quint ill ions, quadrillions, trillions, etc., and the original docxmenta are in Kuwait. 5. The next question is the interpretation of the correspondence with the Iraq Government of 1936/1938 and 1941. As far as we are aware, the terms 'the sheikh' or 'the Sheikhs.!*, referring to the sheikhs of Kuwait and Muhanmerah, were used throughout, without more precise definition. The correspondence arose from the guarantee given by His Majesty’s Government in 1914 and it appears correct to interpret this term as applying to the lands covered by that guarantee. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs have argued that it applies to the lands claimed by the present Sheikh only, who was Sheikh in 1938, and the Court, acting on this, has not allowed the benefit of Article l(ii) of the 1941 Amendment to Land Settlement Law No.29 of 1938 to any land except his personal share. 5. I consider that we should now state our view to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the correct interpretar- tion of this correspondence, we can point out that in that correspondence His Majesty’s Government undertook not to make any claim against the 2 raq Government in respect of any change in the boundaries of the Sheikh’s lands in consequence of the Land Settlement procedure. This presumably meant that we waived our rights to demand the fulfilment by the Iraq Government under Article 8 of the 1930 Treaty of our obligation to the sheikh. The term Sheikh of Kuwait' in this undertaking must be given the same interpretation as in the undertaking given by Taufiq Sewaidi in his reply of the 30th October, 1938. If, therefor the correspondence is interpreted as referring only to the lands held by the present Sheikh, the anomalous position arises that it is still open to His Majesty’s Government to claim from the Iraqi Government the fulfilment of His Majesty’^obligations in respect of lands covered by His Majesty’s Government's obligation other than those now claimed by the present Sheikh. I should be grateful if I could have your opinion on tnia question as early as possible in order that I may take it up with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs before the case is heard in the Court of cessation. Meanwhile, I am informing the Ministry that I understand that their interpretation of the correspondence with this Embassy in 1938 and 1941 may well become a matter for consideration by the Court of Cassation and that I hope to be in a position shortly to discuss the &lt;£iestion with them, in the /light.light of our records. For that reason 1 an asking them to ensure that the appeal is not taken up until I have done so, ? • I am sending copies of this despatch and its enclosures, to the political Resident# Persian Gulf, political Agent# Kuwait# and His Majesty's Consul-General at Basra. I have the honour to he With the highest respect# Bir# Your most obedient humble servant, Humphrey - / eveiyajiTill SHBIKH OF KUWAIT * S !MT£ IN FAQ These gardens are covered by the undertaking given in the letter to the Sheikh of Kuwait from the Resident and Consul-General in the Persian Gulf dated the 3rd November f 1914, thus:- 'furthermore, I make to you, on behalf of the British Government, certain promises concerning Your Excellency personally, viz:- (1) That your gardens which are now in your possession, viz. , the date gardens situate between Fao and Qumah, shall remain in your possession and in possession of your descendants without being subject to the payment of revenue or taxes.* 1 At the time when this undertaking was made the :sheikh of Kuwait was Mubarak, the grandfather of the present Sheikh. It appears that Mr. Dobbs (afterwards High Commissioner) , who was in charge of Tapu in Basra during the occupation, 'registered the lands in the name of the Sheikh” (presumably this means the Al Subah family). The registration, according to Sir Edwin Drower, was known to be dubious In validity on account of the vendox% absence. No proclamation was issued to cover it. The 1950 Treaty It seems that Hia Majesty* s Government regarded the undertaking to the Sheikh of Kuwait as one of the international obligations which would devolve upon Iraq under Article 8 of the 1930 Treaty. It is not however clear from the papers we have whether the Iraqi Government ever accepted this. Indeed it appears from Foreign Office despatch to Tehran No. 416 (E 4396/1192/93) of the 15th August, 1930, paragraph 4, that the Iraqi Government did not accept the similar undertaking to the shaikh of Huharamerah as having devolved upon them. In 1934 however the Law officers of the Crown held that in the even/-of an arbitration it would be likely to be held that the Iraqi Government was bound to implement the undertakings given to the sheikhs of Kuwait and J/uhammerafc (Foreign Office desxmtch to Bagdad No. 58 of 1934). Between 1930 and 1936 efforts were being made to get the Sheikh*s title to his properties validated, but without success. Lana aettleaent Lag In 1936 the Foreign office, in their despatch No. 358 (E 3045/18/93) of the 2nd June, proposed that, subjrot to Bagdad’s concurrence. His Majesty*a Government should agree that Land settlement Law No. 50 of 1932 should be applied to the Cheikh* s properties in Iraq. After assuring themselves that the Bheikh of Kuwait could prove 15 years continuous usufruct, Bagdad agreed; and in his Note No. 347 of the 6th July 1936 to the Iraqi Minister of Foreign Affairs (then Huri Pasha), Mr. Bateman put this proposal to the Iraqi Government. Two extracts from this Note are worth quoting:-. - 2 - (a) - end of paragraph 8:~ ’♦His Majesty* a Govermaent assume that such orders as may be necessary 'will be issued by the pro x jer authorities to ensure that the sheikh* a nonr-lraqi nationality will constitute no impediment or delay to the completion of the registration.' (b) - paragraph 12s- M His Majesty’s Government are prepared to abide by the decisions of the Land Settlement Officer as to the boundaries of the lands in question and by any aodi- fications of these decisions which may result from sub sequent appeals to the Special Court provided for by the law* Yhey are further prepared to undertake not to any claim against the Iraqi Government in respect of any changes which may result to the present boundaries of the sheikh* s lands in consequence of the land settlement procedure.^ In his letter to the Mb as sa&amp;pruo* 14184/2440/100 of the 30th October, 1938, which was encxosed with Bagdad despatch No* 543 of the 3rd November, 1988, Taufiq sewaidi agreed, with certain reservations, to the terms of Mr. Bateman s Note, and the arrangement was finally confirmed by the iimbassador* s Note to Taufiq No. 586 of the 1st November, 1938. It is true that a new Land settlement Law waa passed in 1938, but we have never tried to claim that this mde any difference to the arrangement agreed upon in the above exchange of Notes. Land Settlement Law No. 29 of 1938 Article 10 of this law, which is the most for the present purpose, reads as follows*- All land not found to be Mulk or Matruka or Waqf in accordance with the provisions of this law shall be classified as Miri land that is*- either granted in Tapu; or granted in Lazma; or Miri Sirf.

The Appeals in tapu More than 2#Bee appeals were lodged against Judge Good* s decision hy the cultivators on the Pao estate. After much delay a Special Court was set up in accordance with the Land settlement Law to hear these appeals. The Court sat in Basra under the presidency of Judge Abdul Qadir Jamil* who gave his decision on the 12th July# 1949. The decision of the Appeal Court A summary of the judgment is given at Appendix 'A** to this minute. It reverses Judge Good’s decisions on all the plots except Ho#21. The Judge has argued as follows:- (a) The ract that the Dheikh of Kuwait and his partners did not appeal against Judge Good’s decision means that they accept his distinction between plot Ho. 21 and the rest# that is they admit that all the other plots are miri land. (b) The ta’ aba* agreements were taken under duress and cannot be regarded as valid evidence. The cultivators on the Kao estates are not therefore ta’abs but plantersee• (c) Neither the Bill of Comission issued in 1904 pursuant to an Imperial Decree# nor the Badalat al Jarib**'* 1 constitute sufficient documentary evidence for the purpose of Article 10 (b) (ii) of the Land Settlement Law. /*( d) •.... * 'ta* aba tathmiriya” - a complicated form of tenure. Itoughly# a relationship of cultivator to landlord by which the former gets a percentage (in this case 44ft) of the fi*uit cr&lt; but has no share in the land. 'planter” or ’’gharis” is a technical term here. A ’'planter' has rights in the trees # and the theory underlying Article 10 (b)(iii) of the Lana settlement Law seems to be that the land follows the trees. a Jar lb (said to be 3766 aq.metres) is the traditional unit of measurement for the Basra palm gardens. The 'Badalat al Jarib” are taxation-papers.(d) That being so the land must be dealt with in accordance with paragraph (c)(iii) of article 10 of the Land Settlement Law - paragraphs (c) (i) and (il) already having been ruled out. Note that only in paragx*aph (c) ( iii) was the law amended by the addition of the word ’'Iraqi’' before the word ‘'person”* (e) The undertaking given by the Iraqi Government in paragraph 5 of Taufiq sewaidi’s Note No* 14184/2440/ 100 of the 30th October, 1938# that 'the nationality of the tw &gt; Sheikhs shall constitute no impediment or delay in the completion of the registration of the properties which may be awarded to them in accordance with the provisions of the Land settlement Law’S applies to the person of the then sheikh of Kuwait only#(who is the present sheikh) # and not to other members of the Al Subah family. The most that the Sheikh can ever get out of any plot is the proportion of his share as inherited from Sheikh Jabir the First* (f) Miri land with trees under 10 years old at the time of the proclamation of Land Settlement in Fao camot be granted in tapu# but only in lazma in accordance with Article 11 of the Land Settlement Law* Lazma cannot be granted to non-Iraqis* Miri land with trees m2)re than 10 years old but which wen. planted after the Law for the Disposal of Immovable property (an Ottoman law of 1913) may be granted in tapu, but only to the planters and not to the Sheikh of Kuwait* (g) Mirl land with trees planted before the Law for the Disposal of Immovable property may be granted in tapu to the sheikh of Kuweit, but not to the family of Al bubah. The share of the latter therefore goes to the cultivators. Comments on the decision (a) Nasrat al Farisi, the 3heikh f a lawyer, has often remarked that Judge Good* s distinction between plot No*21 and the rest was mistaken and would cause difficulties. I am not aware on what the distinction 1 s based* (b) The evidence for this is extremely weak. Some of the ta’aba agreements were made and renewed after the end of the Mandate, ^hen the only people who could coerce the ta’abs were Iraqi Government officials* The Judge held that correspondence between local Iraqi administrative officials shows that the Administration interfered in the affairs of the Fao estate* Perhaps, but administrative action was the only way of protecting the Sheikh* a interests before Land Settlement came. The correspondence cited does not prove that the ta'aba agreements were taken under duress* If these agreements are admitted as evidence, the case of Al Subah is very strong. (c) and (d) The Judge held that the 1904 Bill of Commission has not the stren th of a title-deed. That is admitted: otherwise the land would be tapu or at least miri granted in tapu in accordance with paragraph (b)(i) of Article 10 of the Land Settlement Law. But, ahort of a title-deed# what stronger evidence for the purpose of paragraph (b) ( ii) of Article 10 could conceivably be produced ? /(e)*...*(e) This interpretation is not the Judge’s oyoi# I understand that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were asked for a ruling and gave one in this sense in a letter to the Ministry of Justice dated 24th or 29th June* 1949* The iheikh* s lawyers say that they theaselve are unahle to contest this ruling* If it is to he altered His Majesty’s Government* on behalf of the liheikh* must take toe matter up with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (f) and (g) There is much argument a&amp;out the age of the palm trees* and the honesty of the last Ooiiiaittee has been impugned, if the case qannot be dealt with under paragraph (b) (ii) of Article 10 of the Land Settlement Law* then the Judge is right to grant in lazma land on which the trees were less than 10 years old in 1939* and as the Law stands laaaa cannot be granted .to a non-Iraqi* I cannot see how the Law for the Disposal of immovable Property affects the case. It is quoted also in Judge Good’s decision, but there the sheikh gets title whether the trees were planted before or after the date of the Law. The Sheikh’s lawyers are also perplexed about this*Summary of the judgment given on the 12th July# 1949# by the Land Settlement Court of Appeal# Basra» In the case of the Fao Jate Cardens . A. PKNDIX ^ Appellant : obeld Shukur represented by bulaiman Shawwaf Appellees: Heirs of sheikh Jabir Ibn Abdullah Al Siibeh I the Appellant and of all the other appellants in the 8»768 Appeal Cases# appealed against the decision of the Tenth Land Settlement Committee# dated 3rd November# 1943# and published in the annexure to the Iraq Government Gazette of the 21st February# 1944. This decision registered plots numbers 22# 26 and 26 of muqata’a Ho. 6 ’ao as miri land granted in tapu in the name of kheikh Jabir Ibn Abdullah Al bub ah I. The grounds of the appeal were as follows 1. Jabir died nearly 160 years ago. According to the Land Settlement Law# title to miri land may only be vested in living persons. 2. The plots in question were planted by the appellants and should therefore be registered to their name in accordance with clause (c)(iii) amended of Article 10 of the Land settlement Law. 3. The trees were not planted in the days of Sheikh Jabir. Indeed the plots had not at that time emerged from the shatt-alwArab. 4. Clause (c) (iii) amended of Article 10 of the Land settlement Law does not allow the granting in tapu of miri lands to non-Iraqis. 6. The latter part of clause (c) (iii) amended of article 10 of the Land Settlement Law excepts those to whom the Iraqi Government had undertaken to grant miri land in the b a sra Liwa. This is not relevant to the case because the Government have given no such undertaking to the sheikh of Kuwait. Even if the Government had given such an undertaking to Sheikh ♦Mubarak Al StCbah. the undertaking applies to him alone# he being one of many successors to Sheikh Jabir I. therefore# Mdbarak alone may benefit from the undertaking n question: the other heirs of the Sheikh Jabir I re excluded. 1. That the muqata*a was the 4 property of Sheikh Jabir I and passed to his heirs the appellees who have been in enjoyment of it as owners ever since. ♦ It is interesting to note that the appellant’s lawyer is prepared to restrict the under tailing to Mbbarak# whereas the Ministry of Foreign Affairs went further and restricted it to Ahmed# the sheikh in 1936 and now. represented by Nasrat al Facial and Ha as an Abdul Rahman al Umar. INTRODUCTORY On the 28th March# 1944# the attorney of The attorney for the appellees argued: / 2 . . ...2* That the appellants were merely cultivators standing in the relationship to the owners of ta 9 aba tathmiriya# that is a contractual relationship which gives them no share in the land hut entitles then to ' 44$ of the produce of the trees f as proved by the documents on tfiich the President of the Tenth Land Settlement Coaaaittee based his decision. That the ownership of the land by the family of AX subah was iUrther proved by:- (a) A Bill of Oommisaion issued in 1904 pursuant to an Imperial Decree requesting the settlement by arbitration of a dispute about this land between members of the family of A1 Subah. (b) The Badalat al Jarib (some kind of taxation papers) which were given in the names of Al 3ubah. (c) Certain documentary undertakings signed by the appellants and certified by the Notary Public in Basra. The appellants’ attorney said that the appellants were not ta’abst but 'planters” on miri land. He impugned the papers certified by the Notary Public, on grounds not given here. He added that the appellants had signed the ta’aba papers under duress and as proof of tnis requested the production in Court of correspondence between the Mutasarrlf of Basra- the Qaimmaqam of xbul Khaslb and the Mudlr of Fao. Much of this correspondence was produced in the Court, and some of it is quoted in the decision* on the 22nd June, 1949, the appellees’ attorney declared before the Court that, of the muqata’a, one plot belonged to the appellees, having descended to them from its original owner, and that the remainder was mlri land planted by the appellees before the Law for the Disposal of Immovable property, the appellants being ta^bs. The Court found that the president of the Tenth Land Settlement Committee had appointed a body of experts to determine the age of the Palm trees. The Committee submitted their report, No.64 of the 29th June, 1941, dividing the trees into three categories !• Trees under 10 years average age. 2. Trees the average age of which ranged from 10 to 29 years. and 3. Trees over 30 years old. The president of the Land Settlement Committee had then ordered a new inspection, although no objection had been made to the result of the first estimation. In the second estimation, the trees were divided into two categories:- 1 . Trees over 10 years and under 30 years old and 2. Trees over 30 years old.v ■ * In view of this discrepancy a£d of objections raised by the appellants’ attorney, the Appeal Court decided on a third estimation* The Committee submitted its report on the 23rd Kay, 1949, dividing the trees into three categories:- 1* Under 10 years old at the proclamation of settlement* 2* over 10 and under 26 years old at the proclamation of settlement and 3. Qvex' 30 years old at the proclamation of settlement. The appellees’ attorney objected to the estimate of this third Committee. In order to clear up the nationality difficulty! the court asked the Ministry of Justice for the text of the undertalcing referred to in clause (c)(iii) Amended of Article 10 of the Land settlement Law* The reply from the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Foreign Affaire referred to paragraph 5 of the Minister of Foreign Affairs* letter to the British Ambassador No* 14184/3440/100 of the 30th October, 1938: tt As regards paragraph 8, the Goverx*- aent of Iraq confirm that the nationality of the two Sheikhs shall not impede nor delay registration in their names of land that may be assigned to them in accordance with the Land Settlement Law*' The two iheikhs means the sheikh of Kuwait and the Sheikh of Muhammerah. The text of the undertaking does not mention their families* As far as Kuwait is concerned it means the present Sheikh of Kuwait, and not the family of A1 Subah* THF DECISION : The president of the Land Settlement Committee divided muqata’a No* 6 into several plots and decided that plot Ho. 21 was mulk sirf of the family of Al Bubah, and the rest miri land. The Court considers this division and distinction as sound and legal. The appellees* attorneys request the confir mation of this decision. This is to be regarded as an admission that plot No.2l only is raulk sirf and the other plots miri. The so-called Commission Bill of 1904 is not a legal document having the strength of a title deed. It cannot be reckoned as proof of ownership of the land. It is merely a document drawn up by arbitrators for the settlement of an inheritance dispute. The statement of the appellees’ attorney on the 22nd June, 1949» that part of the auqata’a is mlk airf of the appellees and the rest miri land granted in tapu is tantamount to claiming that the planting of the trees by the appellees was before the publication of the Law for the Disposal of Imaovable property and that the land on which trees were planted after that date does not belong to the appellees. /The ...1% - 4 - ' X, The &lt;Jourt finds» after reference to correspondence between the Ministry of Interior, the 2^ Basra, the Qaimmaqaifi of Abul Khaaib and the -udir of ?ao, that the administrative authorities have interfered in the affairs of the Fao muqata’a ana that the ta aba documents were signed under duress* ,heae documents cannot therefore be regarded as valid e videuce• ^ 94 The a PP*2* laa ' t s not therefore ta’abs. but Planters # ^and therefore have the right to benefit i*roia T^ P ? 0 n? l0aS ^° f claU3e ( b )(iii) of article 10 of the Land Settlement Law of 1938, and clause (a) of Article 11 Ox ,aw Jo*5i of 1932 and the Regulation for the rrant of L&amp;znia No* 26 of 1940* in view of all these considerations, the Court has decided as follows:- ^ + Confirms the decision of the Resident of the Land settlement Ooiaaittee of the 3rd + ^ he P lot » °f 1026 donums and 6 oiks, is mulk sirf of the heirs of sheikh Jabir I* . . 2.2 Revokes the previous decision ro ohe^ Sr l!

Your excellency, In his bote bo.16/25/49 dated August 19th 1949) on the subject of the appeal pending before the Court of Cessation in the Case of the estates of His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait in Fao, Mr. Trevelyan informed your excellency that the question of the interpretation to be placed upon the correspondence between the Ministry of foreign Affairs and this embassy in 1936, 1938 and 1941 on this subject had been referred to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. His Majesty's Government observe that the Iraqi Government, in their bote of the 30th October, 1938, and the subsequent correspondence, accepted the proposals put forward in Mr. Bateman's bote of the 8th July, 1936. This note, as will be clear from paragraph 2 aiid subsequent paragraphs of it, concerned the properties covered by the guarantees given by His Majesty's Government in 1914; that is, the properties which were in 1914 in the possession of Shaikh Mubarak' and which have subsequently devolved upon his descendants inducing the present gheikh. I trust therefore that Your Excellency will make it clear to the Court of Cessation that this is the correct interpretation of the correspondence between the Ministry of foreign Affairs and this Embassy, since the interpretation of this corresponaence may become a &gt;uestion for consideration in the appeal shortly to be heard before that Court. In paragraph 12 of Mr. Bateman's ^ote of the 8th July, 1936, he informed the Iraqi Government of the decision of His Majesty's Government not to make any claim against the Iraqi Government in respect of the lands referred to in his bote, as a result of the decision of the Land Settlement Court. I feel I must inform Your excellency thd, shoula the oecision of the Land Settlement Court to confine the Iraqi guarantee of 1538 to the present shaikh be upheld, His Majesty's Government will regard its obligations under the guarantee of 1914 to the other lineal descendents of Shaikh Mubarak, as having devolved upon the Iraqi Government under article 8 of the 1930 Treaty.

He stated that the decision pronounced and appealed against, proves the'right of his clients for the following reasons; 1. The Chief of the 10th Committee of Land Settlement in Basra had pronounced the decision that the said plots belong to Jabir bin Abdulla as Subah, the 1st Ruler of Kuwait, who died about 150 years ago and this decision in in contrary to the decree of the lav/ of settlement which states that the Amereya land should be registered in the name of the living person who deserves to be authorized and in v/hose name could be registered. 2. The aforesaid plots appealed against and which are included in the plot already declared and whose land is Amereya Land appeared and was filled up and planted by the Respondent and by his predecessors and it should be registered in his name according to para (J2) amended from article 10 of the law of settlement 3. The Land Settlement Committee(51 DEPARTMENT/OFFICE. File No. Serial No. I. t)ate of despatch Dated 2. List of enclosures 3 decided the ownership of the said plots and to have them registered in the name of Jabir Abdulla as Subah, the 1st who died some 150 years ago, considering the land as Amereya Land, planted by him, while the plants in the plots are new and were not there during Jabir's time, not only that, but the said land was not brought out of the river on that date. 4. Paragraph (G.3) ratified from Article (10) of the Law of Settlement prohibits registration of Amereya land in the name of a foreigner, and as Jabir bin Abdulla as Subah the 1st and his heirs are not Iraqis, the registration jn their names is not allowed. 5. The last sentence of paragraph (G3) of Article 10 ratified, which exempts those to whom the Iraqi Government have given a guarantee for the rights of authorization inside Basra does not apply to this case because there is no guarantee given by Iraqi Government for the registration of the Amereya Land in the name of foreigners. Even if we suprose that there is EixxKKd; a guarantee given to Shaikh Mubarak as Subah, as it is claimed by the opronents, the said Mubarak is one of the many of the heir of Jabir the 1st in whose name the plots have been registered, and if there is any guaran tee, it should concern only Mubarak and ^is heirs and not the other heirs of Jabir bin Abdulla the 1st. to draw the benefit of this iS. 5 (Lat-ge), Mi-P—813 S&amp;P 6767—(M 1915)—9-3-45 126.000 Pads,(4) guarsntGG 9.s it do6s not concGrn thGiri s.nd tiiG decision nrononncGd by the Chief of Land Settlement Committee and which v/as appealed against does not depend on a legal proof as well and as the client of Appellant in this case has a free hand in these plots, i&amp;xtkESgxxlEtx^ being a planter of an Amereya land, thus the decision of the Chief of Land gs * Settlement ,fisaEK±t±EEXX according to the reasons already stated, becomes incorrect and he asked for its cancellation and that these planted plots which were planted by his client should be authorized in his client*s name, according to the law of land settlement and the Respondents be made to bear the Court exoenses, lawyers wages and other expenses* Thus the Conrt appointed a date for hearing the case and summoned the two parties.

As these documents were found to be v/ithout legal stamps, tne Court decided to order those who produced the documents to pay a legal fine and to fix stamps according to the law.

The appellants lawyers, depending on these facts asked for the reputation of the appeal and the sanction of Chief of Land Settlement * decision. The deputy of the Appellants denied that his clients were Taa’bas (farmers) in this area, but they were planters in it and had a free hand in it, being an Amereya land. They did not sign any document containing their state ment that they were TaaSas.

He also claimed that those who signed these documents were forced by the authority who had almost pressed his clients and compelled them to sign these agreements threatening them by imprisonment. In fact large numbers of them were sent to prison because they had refused to sign the agreements. Sucb-N documents, obtained through the use of force and compulsion are not taken into consideration^ a nd hav no legal value.

The Court received copies of other letters exchanged ar ng the administra tive authotities of Abul Khaseeb’s Region, among which was a letter from Mudlr of the ^istrict of Seiba No.52 dated 29.9.34, add^ssed to Qayemmaqam of Shat-al-ftrab and a copy of letter N o .6420 dated 4.10.34 addressed to the .

Thms the appellants* lawyer asked that the/^ document/ submitted by the Respondents should not be considered for the reasons stated above. When the Session iras held on 22.6.48 Abdul Rahman al Umar the deputy of the Respondent, declared during the hearing of the case that a part of Fao district is owned by his clients and that they inherited it from its first ov/ner as it is told by the decision of the CMef/...11 of Land Settlement; and the other post of this district is Amereya land which has been planted by his clients before the publication of the law relating to the disposal of Umimovable property. He then stated that all the appellants are Taabas in tktsr this district and when reference was made to the file of Land Settlement, it was found that the Chief of Land Settlement had passed a decree to the effect that the Palm trees at Fao district should be inspected and their ages be estimated by the Select Committee. The said Committee carried out the work and estimated the ages of the plants and submitted its report No.64 dated P9.ll.41 in which the Committee had classified all the trees in the gardens of Fao district into three classes. Class 1; w^ose plants average age is less than 10 years, and it was marked on the map by yellow ysnixx colour; Class 2: Whose plants' age differs from 10 to 28 years and it is marked on the map by gremcolour; Class 3: Zahaz whose plants age is more than 30 years and this marked on the map by red colour. It was discovered also that the Chief of Land Settlement had decided that the inspection should again be made and the ages of the plants should be estimated anew.by a hew Committee, without raising any object regarding12 the estimation of* the first experts . This wps done and the Comittee • classified the plants into 2 classes. Class Is whose plants ag© are more than ten years and less than thirty. Class 2s whose plants are is more than that. Due to the differences in the view of the experts in both the inspections and as the two inspections were not ^ according to the principals, and due to personal ii?|b^tions and the objection of the lawyer of the appellants and for the purpose of knowing the ages of the plants in a correct way, the Court decided to re-inspect the gardens and estimate the ages of the plants. When the experts were selected, the Curt deputed the judge of the Court of 1st Instance of AhdulKhaseeb to accompany the Committee for the purpose of supervising their work of inspection and estimation in presence of the deputies of the two parties and Land Settlement Engineer. The Select Committee did its work under supervision of the deputy of the Court and Submitted its report jzfrl dated 23*5.49 in which it is stated that they have completed their work and it is attached to the file of this Court case. According to this report, the Committee classi- fied the ages of the plants into three r&gt;i m13 three classes. Class Is whose plants are was less than ten years at the time when Land Settlement Law was announced, and which is marked on the coloured man by red colour. Class 2: whose ulants age is more than ten years and less than 23 years at the time w her Land Settlement Law was announced and which is nr rked on the map by water colour. Class 3: whose plants age is more than 28 years at the time when the Land Settlement Law was announced, and which marked on the map by nut- brown colour. As to the palm trees planted in plot No.21, this is marked on the map by green colour. The Respondents’ deputies protested against the estimation of the ages of the p^lants carried out by the majority of the Committee, and their protests were written down in the minutes of the hearing of the case. The gist of their protest was that the expert selected by the appellants^ made an arrangement with the expect chosen by the Court to estimate the ares of the plants in a way, which is in contrary to the fact, and that their expert disagreed with this estimation of the plants’ ages and many other protests which are written down in the minutes of the case. Then the Appellants lawyer protested against the nationality of theRespondents claiming that para (G3) of Land Article 10 of the Lew of/Settlement stipulates that the Amereyiah land autho rized by Tapu should be registered in the name of an Iraq} who complies with the conditions mentioned in the 3rd and 4th of nara (B) of the above » mentioned article, and it prevents the foreigners from having any authority. As the Respondents a^e foreigners and l not Iraqis, it is not allowed to authorise any Amereyia land in Iraq to them. The The Court enouired from the Ministry of Justice about t’ :* s and asked them to send s the text of the undertaking discussed in &gt; para (G.3) of Article 10 of the Law of Land Settlement in order to know who are the foreigners to whom the Government had previously gi en an undertaking of having the rights of being authorized in Basra Liwa axil and who are included in the specification mentioned in the previous para. A redy was received in form of their letter Nc.K.S.418 dated 20.6.49 in which they had copied the letter from Ministry of Foreign Affairs No.K.1792/ 1792/100 dated 29.6.49 addressed to them and confirmed by the Ministry of Justice stating that the undertaking queried and to which reference was made ip para (G.3) of Article 10 of Law of Amendment of Law of Land Settlement No.29 of 19af3, No. 26 of 1941 regarding what is stated in para (H) of the letter from H.E. the Minister for Foreign Affairs No.K.14184/2440/1100dated 30.10.193 8 addressed to Mr. Pitman, the British Ambassador in Baghdad, in reply to his letter No.247 dated 8.8.36, which reads as follows: As to para 8 the Iraqi Government confirms that the nationality of the two Sheikhs will not hinder or delay the registration of the property which may be granted to them according to the law of Land Settlement. $hat is meant by t he f, two Sheikas” is ’’Sheikhs of Kuwait and Mohammarah; and the text, as it is quite clear, did mention the families of the two Sheikhs and also what concerns Sheikh of Ku ait does not include As- Subah. Here ends the text of the letter. After hearing what the lawyer of the two parties had to say and after hearing their statements written down in details in the minutes of the Case and as the parties had no mor§ to say the end of the hearing of the Case was made known: DECISION: It has become clear to this Court that the decisions reached by the President of Settlement to the partitioned effect that Fao district No,6 into several strips and his consideration of strip No.21 a mere property of As-Subah and the other strips as Mini Lands (Amereyia was correct and the request made by the lawyers of the Respondents asking for sanctioning the decision of the President of the Settlement and to reject the appeal of the Appella nt16 and their submission of applications to the Court of 1st Instance of Basra : for t^e execution, by way of security » of the crops of date gardens, depending on decrees of the President of Settlement which states that part of the district is to be made owned property and the other is to be Miri Land (Amereyiah/Land) is considered this sanction and is mere property and the other strips are Amereyiah land. The claim put up by the lawyers of the Respondents later on claiming all of the Fao district being owned by their clients does not agree with the request for the approval of the decisions made by the Head of Land Settlement, as well as the document of settlement which is expressed as 'Commission document” and on which tV'e Respondents lawyer relied for the purpose of proving the ownership of As-Subah of Fao district as per the boundaries stated in that document; and is not stated; because this document is not a legal document having the same effect as that of submission that the strip No.21 alone Khakani document or Legal Documents to prove/...to prrve the ownership and which can be taken into consideration when the boundaries er st-ted in it are taken into considoratir^. This docurrert is a document of reco^ciliation - r* rede bv arbitrators selected by the heirs of ’'oh’d and Jarrah as-Suba.h and their uncle 1 ubarak as Subah to settle the ris- understanding th't had taken p^ace between the two parties regarding the heritage as : x rr per the 'IHA-DftT kS ZkVEYIk'. This on hand and on the other hand, the staterent j ade by A.b'du1 rahr,an al in the session held on f2/6/48, that a part of Fao District is owned by his clients and the other is ereyia Land authorized by • ■- » r • r' Tapu, and was planted by his clients before the law of having a free, hand of the untransferable property was published, is an acknowledgement ade by him also th-t all of Fao District was not owned and that what his dients had planted, it was before the publishing of the Law of having a. free hand, and that what is planted after the publishing of the law of having a free hand does not bele belong to his client. Fror the text of the copies of letters and coni unic-tions exchanged between the ! inistry of the Interior, 'utass- _ ft V* ariyiat at Basr-a, Qayemragarreyiat tbdul Khaseeb and T udireyat Faheyat al Fao, it has becore quiteclear thrt the reneging authoritie used to interfere in the rffairs of the Fao District in'such a Danner that they used to force the appellants to sig^ docui e^ts in which they acknowledged that/thpt they were 'Taabas', according to as Suhah's wish. And as it has become clear to the court that the acknowledgerents contained in the docure^ts produced were obtained by force, cor pell and pressure, there is therefore, no way for the respondents to stick to these acknowledge] er.ts alleged to be rrade by the appellants because according to the rules decided by the law 5 acknowledge: ents obtained by force and pressure are not to be considered. Therefore it is impossible to consider the appellants as Taabas in the gardens of Eao and the order of paragraph 3B of Article 10 of the Law of Settlement is applicable to the: with the order of Article (11) para (&amp;) of the law No. (If) of 1932 to be applied according to the issue of the system of the granting of Lazra No. 26 of 1940, whose Article No. 1 points out that the District of Fao which has been notified as 'Settlement Area' by the statement issued by the '’inister of Finance, published in 'Alwagaye al Iraqiu^ No. 1677 dated 9.1.39, an area for the purpose of granting the Lazrna, authorized by law No. (£1) of 1932, to the persons possessing the terms state' in Article No. (11) of the law of Land Settlement.
