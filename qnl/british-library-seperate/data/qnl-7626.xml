The subject matter is Britain's policy towards the development of civil aviation in Egypt; British policy being to restrict the influence of non Anglo-Egyptian companies and governments, with developments in Italian and German aviation being of particular concern. A policy given particular attention is a suggestion for closer collaboration between Imperial Airways and Misr Airwork, with a view to reserving local short-haul traffic for the latter firm. A couple of memoranda prepared on the topic by Group Captain Reginald John Bone, Director-General of Civil Aviation under the Egyptian Government, can be found on folios 91-93 and 136-139.A note outlining an informal meeting between Sir Francis Claude Shelmerdine of the Air Ministry and Mohamed Taher Pasha, Vice-President of Misr Airwork, at the House of Commons in July 1937 can be found between folios 23-27. Also included in the file is a letter from Kamal Eloui Bey, Managing Director of Misr Airwork, to Frederick Alan Irving Muntz dated 19 June 1937: see folios 29-33. A letter from George Beharrell, Chairman of Imperial Airways, addressed to the Foreign Office and dated 1 July 1937, can be found on folio 35.The correspondence included in the file has been periodically forwarded to the Under-Secretary of State for India by the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in order to keep the India Office updated on developments; none of the correspondence in the file is directly addressed to the India Office.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Frederick Alan Irving Muntz</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director-General of Civil Aviation</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Misr Airwork</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Misr Airwork, Vice-President</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Misr Airwork, Managing Director</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Imperial Airways</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Egypt</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Egypt</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Civil aviation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Airlines</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00022a#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00022a#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00022a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
