The Foreign Office have no special observations to offer on these points. I notice that you have not sent a copy of your letter to the Treasury. If you wish us to put the matter before that Department we shall want you to make out a strong case; in particular we shall need further information on the following points.

There is apparently already a water supply through the medium of water boats from the Shatt-el-Arab. If the proposed pipe line from Iraqi territory were stopped it should be possible for Koweit to fall back on the existing supply through the Shatt-el-Arab. 3. We could not presumably allow the Iraqis to put pressure on Koweit in normal timei through stopping the supply from the Shatt; and in war, if we lost control of the Shatt, it would appear to be of relatively little importance to keep control of Koweit. 4. An independent water supply for Koweit would no doubt be very desirable, but we do not consider that there is sufficient strategic need for it to warrant payments from Naval Funds. 5. If, as a result of the project for an Iraqi relief port for the Shatt, a site for this port is selected at Khor Abdulla (Shetana) or Koweit itself, the Iraqis would of course see to it that the water supply is assured. 6. I am sending a copy of this letter to Bagallay, Mallaby and Coryton. Yours sincerely, . Peel, Esq., M.C., India Office, S.W.l.^0 i (t&gt;b. 778fo MINISTRY, ADASTRAL HOUSE, p KINGSWAY. S E C R 21st November, 1938 KINGSWAY. W.C.2. Thank you for your letter PZ7245/38 of the 8th November. As you will know, we are averse to the possibility of any increase of f Iraq, influence in Koweit since, in the admittedly somewhat unlikely event of the ’Iraqis turning against us in an emergency, Koweit when developed, might provide us with a very useful base for Air Forces at the head of the Persian Gulf. We would, therefore, welcome any scheme which offers the possibility of securing an adequate and independent water supply within the Sheikdom. At the same time so long as 1 Iraq is our ally and our present relations are maintained the question seems to be almost entirely political. We think, tnerefore, that while it is desirable that the sum of approximately £300 should be made available for the purpose indicated, it would be difficult to justify any charge on strategical grounds or against Royal Air Force funds. Your R.T. Peel, Esq., M.O., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.7582 i (y % /D 2 November, 1938. Thank you for your letter PZ.7245/38 dated 8th November, 1938, on the subject of v/ater supplies in Koweit• As was indicated in the course of the discussions on the project of developing a new port for Iraq at the head of the Persian Gulf, the War Office would regard as undesirable any increase of Iraqi influence in Koweit which might tend to draw the Shaikh into a position of dependence on the King of Iraq. It is not impossible that, in v/ar, it might be necessary to send a small force to i-oweit to assist- in the protection of the State; this would be the more likely to arise if oil supplies were discovered and developed in the State. On general grounds, therefore, we should welcome the development of an independent v/ater supply within Kov/eit State. On the other hand, v/e consider that the matter is primarily political, and that, so long as Iraq is our ally, the strategical implications are not sufficiently definite or serious, so far as the Army is concerned, to justify a charge against Army funds.

As you are aware iiuwait at present gets its water supply from the Shatt al Arab by means of water boats. There is now a proposal in the air for water to be piped from Zubair (in Iraq territory) to Kuwait by an Iraqi- Kuwaiti Company, 'i’his would of course put the water supply of Kuwait, which naturally is a vital factor, under complete control of Iraq. Moreover, there is already the Kuwaiti-Iraqi llectric Supply Company in Kuwait as well as the Kuwaiti-Iraqi Transport Company, and another joint iraqi-ivuwaiti concern would tend to increase j_raqi influence in ivuwait. 2. It is true that the present Shatt al Arab supply is under Iraoi control but it would be a more difficult matter from the Iraqi point of view to deal with a number of water boats, than to turn off the tap, which is all the Iraois would have to do if there was a pip© line. 3. The only alternative to the pipe line is a local supply of water from wells, either artesian or otherwise, and it is possible that if there were reasonable prospects of a sunply from this source a local Kuwaiti Company might be formed to undertake the project. From the strategic and political point of view a local supply would be dis tinctly preferable to a piped supply from Iraq, and in this connection / R.T.Peel Esquire, M.C., The India Office, London.connection I enclose copy of letters dated the 18th duly and 23rd August 1938 from Messrs. A.Beeby Thompson &amp; Partners, Consulting Engineers, London. From these you will see briefly that Mr.Beeby Thompson, who has worked for the Colonial Office, is willing to undertake a hydrological survey of Kuwait territory. I am afraid that it would be no use asking the Kuwait Government to pay his expenses but I do think it would be worth the while of His Majesty’s Government considering the question of meeting these on strategical and political grounds. 4. As you will see Mr.Beeby Thompson places his fees at 10 Gs.a day and estimates his time in Kuwait at about two to three weeks. His expenses here would be nil as de Gaury would kindly put him up and the State would provide his transport. There would be his passage from England to Kuwait and back but if he proceeds to the Hadramaut on behalf of the Colonial Office, as appears likely, the cost would be reduced. I do not suppose that the cost of the Kuwait share of the activities would come to more than about £ 300/-. 5. You might like to get into touch with Mr.Beeby Thompson or his firm. I am sending copies of this letter to MetcalfeCopy of letter No. ABT/RLC dated 18th July 1938, from ?£r. A. Beehy Thompson of Messrs* A. Bee by Thompson &amp; Partners, Consulting engineers, 18, St: Swithin f s Lane, London, B.C.4, to captain G. 3. de Gaury, Political Agent, Kuwait. Major Holmes called a gew days ago and said Ihat you were very perturbed about the water question in Kuwait and that you were considering an investigation of the question. I promised to write you on the subject - hence this communication. As a matter of fact, I had a long conference recently with the new British Resident in the Hadramaut who is discussing with the Government a possible investigation by myself of the water supplies this autumn. From many years of experience in water surveys of desert- lil®, barren countries, I ha Tie proved that potable water can generally be located at a moderate depth at carefully selected sites. Where geological maps exist, the work of exploration is greatly simplified, but only an hydrologist with experience of desert conditions can accurately size up the prospects in any particular region. The initial work in all hydrological surveys is to make a preliminary hasty trip by oar or plane over the country it is desired to develop with maps showing the regions where water is most needed. In this way it is possible to decide jus t where surface run-off rain water concentrates and travels, ifrus giving a clue to localities likely to prove productive of ground water. CUam ** KSvo c Ur % ■ On mayy expeditions I have carried a portable outfit for testing shallow supplies quickly, as all the needful apparatus can be put into a Ford truck. In the course of a few hours it Is often possible to prove the presence and approximate quality of water in dry rdver beds or flood water courses. During the great War large supplies of pure ground water /&lt;■;&lt; ■ Xh - 2 - water were made available for troops at a few hours* notice as will be seen from references to ray little book 'BMSRQENCY WATER SUPPLIES’* a copy of which I am taking the liberty of forwarding to you under separate cover. My experience in desert or semi-desert country water supplies includes the Sudan, Egypt, Palestine, Iraq, Aden, Somaliland, Kenya, India (Nawanagar, Kutoh, Dhrangadra aid Punjab), Burma, Northern Nigeria, Peru and Cyprus. The most startling developments were in the dry belt of the Sudan where on my advice over a period of some 10 years piped water supplies were developed for Port Sudan, Kassala, Tokar, El Obeid, Gebait, Haife and a number of stations on the railway lines. Pump stations were erected at drilled wells across the country from El Obeid to El Jfcsher where formerly travellers and Militajy expeditions ha d to carry water. In most oases the prospects of developing potable waters were regarded as hopeless and often good water was obtained beneath water which could not be used by aninals or men» We have acted as Consulting Engineers to th e Crown Agsnts for the Colonies for many years and prepared water schemes for various West Indian Islands and Bri ti ah Guiana and in Africa for Somaliland, Kenya, Uganda, Somaliland, Nigeria and Iraq. I should be pleased to hear from you more about the water difficult! as of Kuwait and if I can be of any assistance, let me know.I 1 Cl ’ o \ 'ui lies srt-L^ompson Letter dated 23rd, August 1938 &amp; Partners, 18, St. Switdin's Lane, London, £.0.4, to to the Political Agent, Kuwait. Te are obliged for your letter of August 5th. and will endeavour to trace the references to water in the hooks you name. Holmes gave us very little information about the district. One way or another we expect to he able to obtain some useful data concerning the geology of the region which, after all, is not very different from that of Iraq on the North, where we have done much worK. Doubtless some kind of rainfall figures are available. We are aware that the linancial resources of the smaller States are very much restricted and one realizes the hesitation felt in advising expense when the results of our study might be disappointing. -Te also know full | well that it is useless to recommend schemes involving a heavy expenditure. If arrangements are made for a visit to the Hadramaut now under consideration by the authorities it would not be difficult to proceed to Kuwait from there, aiid naturally the cost of both trips v7ould be reduced by sharing on some equable basis the charges incurred in reaching Arabia. Te will endeavour to get some decision reached about Fadramaut and then write you fully. We presume that suitable arrangements would be made in Kuwait for accommodation and movements about the country in company with a guide and interpreter. Our usual charges for Crown Agents work are 10 Os. a day and out-of-pocket expenses whilst away from London, but it may be that a round charge would be more acceptable to the authorities covering both fees and expensesexcept each ae are incurred in Kuwait, and which we have no means of estimating. This will give you some idea of the costs involvec hut if the Hadramaut investigation is decided there would he somesuhstantial benefit to both in sharing expenses and fees on journey. Some date before Xmas would lively prove most suitable if a visit was decided upon. Te hardly thinic the investigation would he short!# of results after our experiences in other desert countries, and at Aden upon which I reported early in the war. We should imagine that two of three weeks in the country would suffice tc form a fair opinion as to what course to take. P.S. We got from Stanfords today a map of Kuwait giving a certain amount of sketch topography, hutmost of the Hadramaut area was a hlank beyond the coast line.Note by Political A^ent. Kowelt. (December 1933 : P. Z. «*»/34: ). | 3 faa NOTE ON THE DRINKING WATER AVAILABLE IN KUWAIT AND THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY. Inside the town proper of Kuwait, there are many salty and brackish wells which provide water for washing purposes, but only one exists which gives good sweet water, but this only in small quantities. Immediately outside the town walls and close to the official Bedouin camping grounds, there are two groups of wells known as - (a) A1 Dasma (b; A1 Shamiyeh. The former need not be considered in this note as there are only 40 wells, in poor condition. The latter i.e. the ’’Shamiyeh' wells, consist of nearly 600 small wells. They are situated in several groups to the Couth West of the Town, and from j a mile to a mile from the walls. Though the number sounds imposing, the wells themselves are poor affairs, scooped out by hand, and in some cases lying only a few feet apart. None of the wells are lined, and mostly are under a yard in diameter. The wells vary considerably in yield and quality, and also, to some extent, in accordance with the seasons of the year: some becoming rather brackish towards the end of summer. One recently tested was 40 feet deep, and had 2 feet of water, yielding 45 gallons which, however, soon refilled. In former years these Shamiyeh wells used to supply practically the entire population of Kuwait with water, but with the great increase in population during Shaikh ubarak s reign, they began to prove insufficient, particularly afte. a2 scanty rainfall. The rainfall during the winter of 1907-1908 was particularly had and in the summer of 1908 the water problem may, for the first time, be said to have become acute. It occurred to one boatowner to try importing water for sale from the Shatt-al-Arab, and, as it was found that water so brought could be sold very cheaply, and yet return a good profit, a regular fleet of water carrying boats, has grown into existence. At the present day there are 49 boats, of the type known as 'Bum', employed exclusively in this trade. Of these an average of 6 arrive daily, each with about 8,000 gallons of water worth roughly Rs.100/-. Many more people, especially the poorer classes now drink imported river water than water from the 'Shamiyeh' wells, as in view of the high rates of donkey and camel carriage from the latter, they find it cheaper and easier to do so, For a British force stationed at or operating from Kuwait, there would probably be sufficient water available from the Shamiyeh wells to supply all needs especially if such force were camped near to the wells themselves. As in the case of the townspeople, however, transport has to be considered and it might be found more convenient and economical to use imported water, which could always be made available in reasonable quantities, boats being brought to any part of the foreshore desired. No pumps or piping are available, as the water is always landed from the boats in skins or in kerosene oil tins. Large numbers of locally made v/ooden water tanks are available. One or two sweet water wells exist at Haweli (5 miles) and Birra (10 miles) but the cost of bringing in the water would certainly be prohibitive for the great majority of the population.i ' •••&lt; •' I The Hon’ble the Political Resident in'' the Periian Gulf presents his compliments to ^//2 !• H.M.

The Shaikh of Kuwait, v/hose first object was to discover wells suitable for use by a frontier post, has taken no action, because on second thoughts, as he says, a post, even with water, if v/ithout rapid communications would be no use. His intention is to wait the establishment of Cable and Wireless here, when ' he will approach them about a wireless set for the post and the training of personnel to work it. He feels fairly sure of finding water near and south of Cafwan, and anyway there are existing good wells at '^ashaniya, not very far away in Kuwait territory from the frontier. I have however little doubt that the over-riding consideration in his mind has been economy. 3. Reference (b). The Kuwait Oil Company agreed to help the bhai di by leaving down any piping to water they might discover during the geophysical survey last winter. lo water was found, but officials of the Company, so they have told the bhaikh, believe it might be found at points at which their work did not necessitate their drilling,in particular ^est and -N.v/. from Kuwait town I#e. betv/een the al Batin and Jahra village, and about the al Liyah. 4. In a general discusaion of the water problem with the Jhaikh recently he told me that he thought he mi_ T ht, with Ira^i permission, allow a company to be forraed v/hich would pipe water from the chatt al Arab to Kuwait* when I expressed my surprise he said that this would be only 'in the last resort', but I am inclined to think - since to dig wells here, he would have to expend money, and if a compan were to form he would receive at once concession 'jC payments from the company, and possibly a percentage on its profits - that he would prefer the company. To His Highness, I notice, economy is an increas ingly important criterion. 5. I think that you, considering the strategic aspect, would prefer that Kuwait be made independent of outside water supplies, by pipe line or otherwise, and that full exploration of local resources should be made. I shall therefore, unless I hear from you that you wish other wise, encourage the Shaikh in such exploration. dd G. 3. de Gaury, Gaptain. 3 olitical Agent, Kuwait.No. C/335 of 1937.

The bhaikh of Kuwait himself apparently realises that there is little to be gained by making representations to the •Iraq Government on the matter as he informed the Political Agent, Kuwait, on the latter 1 s return from recess at the end of September that he was taking steps to render Kuwait independent of , Irac, for its water supply by (a) exploring for new wells this winter, and (b) arranging privately with the Kuwait Oil Company for the handing over of certain wells and pumps. In all the circumstances I do not think that any represent ations to the ’Iraq government are either necessary or advisable. bd. T.C. FOWL*,, Lieut.-Colonel Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.
