From K. C. Sen, Esquire, Registrar, High court. Appellate Side, Bombay. To The Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department, Bombay. Proposed amendments of the Abyssinia Order in Council. Sir, In reply to your letter H0.3568-B, dated the 2nd November 1927, on the subject mentioned above, I am directed to state that their Lordships the Acting Chief Justice and Judges are still of opinion that it is undesirable in the present state of things that extra work of this kind should be imposed on this Court, for the work involved may be heavier than is now anticipated. I am also to point out that the jurisdiction exercised by this Court m Zanzibar from 1897 to 1914 was withdrawn and vested in His Majesty’s Court of Appeal for Xsxx Eastern Africa at Mombasa by the Zanzibar Order in Council of 1914; and I am to suggest that it would be more appropriate that the Appellate Jurisdiction over Abyssinian Consular Courts should be vested in that Court. I am also to request that a copy of my letter Ho. 4240, dated the 28th July 1927, may be forwarded to the Secretary of State for India in Council. 2. Subject to the foregoing remarks their Lordships views on the proposed amendments of the Abyssinia Order in Council, 1913 are as follows:- U)(1) The amendments of Articles 35, 50, 52, 56 and 123 being either consequential or as not affecting the jurisdic tion of this Court, do not call for any remarks. (2) The amendment of Article 76 allows a second appeal in cases of the kind mentioned in clause (II) read with clause (I). Their Lordships think that in such cases there should be conferred only a power to apply in revision, as provided in Chapter XXXII of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898. The Court ordinarily does not go into questions of fact when exercising its powers of revision, but can always do so if there appear to be good grounds for so doing* As to clause (a) (i) their Lordships think that the right of appeal should be further restricted by excluding cases where the imprisonment imposed is less than three months, or the fine inflicted is less than ten pounds. As to clauses (II) (a) (2) and (II) (*&gt;) (2) their Lordships would point out that leave to appeal 1 ^ ^ provision foreign to criminal law in India, and they are not sure how it will work in practice. (3) In respect of the amendment proposed to be made in draft article 104, their Lordships would point cut that the distinction made hetween a decision of the Court of the Consul General and a final decision of the Court roughly corresponds to the distinction hetween an 'Order' and a 'decree' in Section 2 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908. Their Lordships have considered whether it would not he better to have appeals regulated on the lines of Article 56 of the Zanzibar Order in Council, 1906, and of Article 28 of the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council, hut on the whole they think that the proposal in the amend ment may he accepted preferable. A good deal, however, will depend on the way in which the Consul General exercises his discretion in giving leave to appeal; and the question may hereafter require reconsideration* AsAs to clause (III), their Lordships are of opinion that the form of appeal prescribed in Form Uo.l of Appendix G of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, may be adopted with suitable variations for cases where the leave of the Consul General has been obtained* 3* I am also to point out that under Article 118 of the Abyssinia Order in Council, 1913 all Court Pees have to be credited to His Majesty^ Government, and this substantiates the complaint made in my letter No.4240 of the 28th July 1927 that the cost of these appeals, so far as the services of the High Court is concerned, will fall entirely on the Indian revenues. 4. Lastly I am to suggest that a provision similar to Articles 35 and 36(2) of the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council, 1907, should be inserted, to allow a party to an appeal, who is unable to arrange to be represented, to submit in writing any arguments which he desired to submit to the High Court in support of his case* I have, etc., Sd/- K.

I am directed by Lord Cushendun to transmit to you herewith, to be laid before the Earl of Birkenhead, a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Addis Ababa enclosing a memorandum by Mr. Consul Maclean on the subject of Section 74 of the Abyssinian Order in Council. 2* There appears to be no provision corresponding to the article in question in any of the other Foreign Jurisdiction Act Orders in Council under which Indian law is applied in countries in which His Majesty exercises ex-ueixitoria^- jurisdiction. The reason for this is that in all the other cases (for example Article 10 of the Persian Coasts and Islands Order in Council 1907) the Court established in the country concerned was put in the position of a subordinate Indian court and an appeal lay to some superior Indian Court in accordance with the ordinary Indian provisions as to appeals. Consequently no special provision as to appeals was necessary. In tne case of Abyssinia no appeal was provided to any Indian couru accordingly Section 74 provides for an appeal to the Court c, the Consul-General; thence there is %y special leave an appeal to the Privy Council. It may he, as Hr. Maclean suggests, that the wording of Article 74 is not consistent with the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure, which, under Article 28 of the Order in Council, is generally applicable. , -i j rueeive the ebserva— 3.

I have myself had experience of the difficulty to which the doubtful meaning of the section above-mentioned can give rise. Prior to my hearing of a recent appeal on a point of fact in a criminal case Counsel for the Respondent objected to being called upon to answer the appeal as it was then framed, and only withdrew his objection on the understanding that the vague terms of section 74 of the Abyssinian Order in Council should be brought to your notice and a ruling requested. 3. I trust therefore that you will give the enclosed memorandum your careful consideration, and. I snculd be grateful to learn in due course of any amendment you may decide to make in the relevant section ox the Order in Council in the light of Mr. Maclean’s observations. I have &amp;c., (Signed) R. Dunbar. The Right Honourable Sir Austen Chamberlain, K.C., etc ., etc ., etc.« PY 420/47/1) Enclosure in Mr. Dunbar's despatch No. 18C of July 31st, 1928. MEMORANDUM. Attention has recently been called to a curious point in connection with the Abyssinian Order in Council. Section 74 of that order reads ’’Where a person is convicted of any offence before any Court - (a) If he considers the conviction erroneous in law , then on his application within the prescribed time (unless it appears merely frivolous, when it may be refused); or (b) If the Court thinks fit to reserve for consideration of the Court of the Consul General any question of law arising on the trial; The Court shall state a case, setting out the facts and grounds of the conviction ana the question of law, and send or deliver it to tne Court oi t/ie Consul General’ 1 . In the first place this section appears to confuse the two quite different procedures of ’’Reference” and ’’Appeal”. According to the Code of Criminal Procedure in British India, Reference means the submission of a question of law which arises during the h earing to a Higher Court for decision and judgment is either suspended, until the decision is made known, or given subject to that decision. (See section 432). The sense of section 74 (a) of the Order in Council is quite different, since it is not m accordance - iwi t c Indian Code to 'state a case' when an appeal ia applied for. InIn the second place the Order in Council does not allow appeal except on r, question of law. The Indian Code on the other hand (Section 418) says clearly ”An appeal may t»iie on a matter of fact as well as a matter of law except 'where the trial was by jury, in which case the appeal shall 'lie on a matter of law only'. Thus in my humble and uninstructed opinion the framers of the Order in Council appear to have - if not confused- combined in Sections 74 and 75 the procedure f-oi Appeol and Reference which causes great difficulty in practice; ana also to have deprived appellants of a right which they possess under the Indian Code ~ viz to appeal on a matter of fact.

Under Articl | 118 of the original Order*’fees can be applied as the Secretary of State with the concurrence of the Treasury directs; apparently the fees could be credited to India under administrative arrangements similar to those made for the allocation of the charges for detention at Aden. From the Bombay High Court Article (6) I &amp; II of the draft which provides for appeals against convictions and sentences. In cases where convictions and sentences in the Consular Court are affirmations or amendments of those of another court (i.e. when the Consular Court is really acting &amp;fr an appellate capacity) the appealto the High Court should be limited to applications in revision as provided in Chapter XXXII of the C.P.C. 1898. Article (6) II (a) • No appeal (unless with the leave of the Consular Court' to be allowed against convictions in cases where the punishment awarded is less than three months imprisonment or £10 fine. Article (6) II (a) (2) and II (b) (2) ^-whiek provide for appeals against convictions and sentences respectively with the leave of the Consular Court in cases other than those expressly provided for. The High Court point out that leave to appeal is a provision foreign to criminal law in India, but they do not definitely suggest any alteration of the draft. Article (7) deals with Civil actions; it defines decisions and final decisions” of the Consular court and provides for appeal by leave from the former and fq£ a right of appeal, in certain cases, from the latter. The Hig n Court think the draft acceptable but point out that much will depend on the way in which the Consul- General exercises his discretion in giving leave to appeal, Article 7 (III) The High Court state the form of appeal which in their opinion should be adopted when leave to appeal is granted by the Consular Court in a civil action. But the point on which the Foreign Office desired advice was the form of the petition to be used 'm criminal cases under Article (6) III (see enclosure to Adis Ababa despatch of 20th January 1927, and paragraph 4 of the Foreign Office reply of 12th March 1927 - P.1282/27 : flae C) * Jt mi S ht be worth while to ask the Government of Inaia to obtain the view of the High Court as to the fo rm2280 5000 9.27 V Minute Paper. Department. ) 'l /^.^/’/zfy M. form of petition? If so we could at the same time ask the Government of India whether a further letter is to be expected expressing their views on the other points on which the High Court have commented. The point on which the Foreign Office specially desire observations is that of the limitation of the powers of the Court in the award of punishments (see last sentence of Foreign Office letter of 14th December 1926 - P.4405/26). As the High Court make no observations on this and i the Government of India did not suggest alteration of the draft Order ; it may be sufficient when we vrite to the Foreign Office to inform them that fjQ have no amendment to suggest on this point. v /^TL /ct-fWi jy Z+WJ ,l • H&gt;’. tfi In India Court fees are levied on all civil appeals and on aoma criminal appeals. I do not know what fees.if any,are levisi in the Consular Courts in Abyesinia^or whether any will be levied on aooeals so the Bigh Court oonba.y.

The Consul leneral will of course arrange is* to meet the expenses isxsuKxsi incurred under new Article 78 (Vli). I should think that the question how expenditure is to be * 9 t could be arranged without special provision in the Order,In civil cases the cest of pnccseclings will presumably fall on the parties under Rules of Court made under the Order, la iRdia fhe High Courts would be overwhelmed if second axoeals were a»]lowsd in criminal cases in India*. If criminal cases from Abyssinia are likely bo be few in number it probably does not matter much whether a sesRs^appeal or an application in revision is allowed. It certainly seems to be desirable to bar criminal appeals in smadl cases as suggested by the High Court. I would not interfere with the provision for a criminal appeajl by leave of the Consul general. Kor would I interfere with this similar provision regarding civil appeals. The form of an appeal is not of much consequence. It can be prescribed by Rules of Court. India the form is practically the same for civil and criminal cases. It is Quite unnecessary to ask the Covt of India about the form for criminal appeals. In my opinion the Consul General should not be allowed to inflict 3 . sentence of imprisonment exceeding ten years. / fT. si- JJsfi Conf i dential ‘A 1 No.3568-B. Political Department.

The Court ordinarily does not go into questions of fact when exercising its powers of revision, but can always do so if there appear to be good grounds for so doing. As to clause (a) (i) their Lordships think that the right of appeal should be further restricted by excluding cases where the imprisonment imposed is less than three months, or the fine inflicted is less than ten pounds. As to clauses (II) (a) (2) and (II) (b) (2) their Lordships would point out that leave to appeal is a pro vision foreign to criminal law in India, and they are not sure how it will work in practice. (3) In respect of the amendment proposed to be made in draft article 104, their Lordships would point out that the distinction made be tween a decision of the Couit of trie Consul General and a final decision ol the Court roughly corresponds to the distinction between an ’‘Order* 1 and a “decree’* in Section 2 of tne Civil Procedure Code, 1908.

Moreover there appears to be some misapprehension on the point of the Indian tax-payer being charged for the disposal of these cases.

The High Court of Bombay are not willing to take up &lt; 2 . appellate work from Abyssinia on the ground that they are at | present overworked. As will be seen from paragraph 4 ox my letter No.3568-3., dated the 10th September 1927, the Government of Bombay disagreed with the view expressed in the letter from the High Court Ho.4240, datec the July 1927. The present strength of the High Court is in excess of the normal, and the few cases from Abyssinia would not really affect their work in any way. The suggestion that some other Courts should be given this work can hardly oe accepted, as it is not likely that other Courts would have the status and efficiency of the Bombay High Couro. Court No.5239, dated the The letter from the High 19th October 1927, to which they refer in tneir letrer\ letter lTo.6358, dated the 20th December 1927, deals with the proposal to raise the permanent strength of the High Court Bench from eight to eleven. A copy of this letter has already been sent in advance to the Government of India in the Home Department, as desired by their Lordships. The official letter, together with copies of two further letters received from the High Court on the subject, was sent to the Government of India with the letter from the Government of Bombay in the Home Department Ho. 9450, dated the 11th February 1928. It will be seen therefrom that the conclusions which the Government of Bombay have reached after a very careful consideration of all the relevant facts and figures arethat, while a ninth Judge may be required for some years to come and a tenth Judge for the whole of the next financial year, no case has been made out on the score of an expected continuation of increased work either for the appointment of a temporary eleventh Judge or for any addition at present to the permanentNo.4240.

The Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. Subjects- Proposed amendments of the Abyssinia Order in Council. jr. Sir, * With reference to your letters No. 35S8-B., dated the 8th and 29th April 1927, on the subject of the proposed amendments of the Abyssinia Order in Council, I am directed by the Honourable the Chief Justice and Judges very respect fully to object to any appeals from the Abyssinia Consular Court being sent to this High Court. I am to point out that the Bench of this Court is already understaffed and overworked and that there are large arrears of v/ork in all branches C which cannot be overcome until Government appoints a suffi cient number of Judges. Despite repeated requests for an adequate Bench, the number of Judges has even been reduced recently. Thus for long periods since June lS2o trie Bench has been kept below its normal strength of 8 permanent and 2 temporary Judges. The June sittings this year began with only 8 Judges, and though a 9th temporary Judge is eXjjectud at •■Aie end of July, a 10th temporary Judge is not anticipated beiore next November. Accordingly any increased work would seriously prejudice the Indian litigant, who would have his cases still further delayed-* In this connection I may point out that on the originalOriginal Side (which, deals with cases originating in the City of Bombay) there are some 1300 suits ready and waiting to be heard for periods ranging up to 3 years and upwards. On the Appellate Side (which deals with appeals from the mufussil or country districts) there are 608 Civil first and second appeals ready and waiting to be heard, a large number more will be ripe for hearing in the near future. The Appellate figures show a tendency to rise particularly as regards first appeals, and as the latter involve questions both of fact and law they usually take longer to dispose of than second appeals which are confined to points of X»aw. Thus in the first six months of 19E7 350 new first appeals have been filed. This is at the -rate of 700 per annum, as compared with 536, 541, 475, 402, 393 and 368 for each of the six previous years back to 1921 respectively. To this must be added a heavy increase in criminal work. S’cr instance, Confirmation (murder) cases from the mufussil for the first six months of 1927 nearly equal the normal number for a whole year. And as regards the City of Bombay one of the heaviest criminal sessions on record is now in progress, which will occupy the time of t.. o •-' O: sitting singly for some four weeks. During that time criminal appeals from the mofussil have to remain in abeyance, and are consequently getting into arrears as they require a Bench 01 two Judges, but no more Judges can be spared for criminal work j; fi out of the present reduced number oi 8 Judges. o.p&amp;ri from these considerations, serious thougn they are, their Lordships would point out that appeals from lay Courts, such as a Consular Court, are almost sure to give a great deal of practical trouble in their disposal. And this means Wime which can ill be spared. This at any rate has been the experience of this Bigh Court in appeals from Aden, where the trouble has been aggravated by the fact that hither to lawyers have not been allowed to appear on behalf of their , , +v,tq t-rmible is in a. fair way to be clients. As regards Aden, this trouoxe w* +n thp recent Bill and to a trained Judge removed having regard to one recei 4 . w rnjrpmment. But their Lordships having been sent tnere by Grovernmenu. I- • &gt;1 VI Vll( 43 ) Lordships deprecate the present proposal to make Bombay a Court of Appeal from another lay Court. In this connection I am to urge that a burden of this nature should not fall exclusively on one High Court, and that other Courts, such as Mombasa, Ceylon or Karachi would seem equally, if not more, convenient in point of access or other wise . Some of their Lordships notice that the proposals under consideration do not involve any suggestion that the Abyssinia Consular Court should contribute to the expenses of the Appellate Court in a different country. But this would seem to them a fair matter for consideration, even though some of the parties concerned may be oi Indian biitn. At present in Bombay the costs of both the civil and criminal Courts in the High Court are borne in effect by the civil litigant resident in India. Thus in the Administration Report for 1925, the Original Side shows a net surplus of Es* 7 4 - lacs 01 re ce ip to over expenditure, and though the Appellate Side shows a deficit Ox about Ss.2 lacs, the net result is a profit of Es. 5£ lacs. This is irrespective of some Ss. 8 lacs collected by the Original Side for Probate Duty. But if even 10^ is allowed xor the cost of collection, this v/ould increase the net profit to about 6 lacs (See paragraphs 15, 17, and 28). The practical effect, therefore, of the present pro posal would be this, that while the civil litigant resident in India would have to pay for or at any rate contribute to the costs of appeals- from a foreign country, he would yet have his litigation still further delayed by the foreign appeals thus brought to this Court. Their Lordships then being opposed in principle to the proposed amendments, they with all respect would ask to he excused from advising on the details of the draft Order m Council or on the form in which appeals from the Consular Court should be presented.

Article 5 . The Government of India observe from paragraph 5 of the Foreign Office letter forwarded with your letter Ho.P.4405-26, dated the 18th Jamuary 1927, that 10 years was provisionally adopted as the maximum term of imprisonment xn the belief that this is the longest term of imprisonment awardable under the Indian Penal Code by a court in Brxtxsn India. Actually the’re are four cases in which the Indian Penal Code admits of a court passing a sentence of imprisonment 14 vears (see sections 115, 222, 392 and 457), extending up to i4 years &lt;^0 thp 'Executive Government to commute while section 55 empowers the Exeoax.iv .

The comment of the Government of Bombay on this article rests on a misunderstanding of the position* The statement in this Department telegram to which the Bombay Government refer regarding the necessity for legislation in the Indian Legislature to authorise the reception of prisoners in Bombay was made with reference to prisoners sentenced by the Abyssinian tribunal referred to in Article 35 of the principal Order in Council. The Court referred to in Article 56 of trie principal Order, which Article 5 of the draft Order reenacts without any amendment relevant to Bombay, is a British Court, and there has never been any doubt as to the competence of the officers in charge of prisons in Bombay to give effect to sentences passed by such court. 4. Articles 6 and 7 .

Subiect:- Proposed amendments to the Abyssinia Order in Council. Sir, I am directed t&gt;y the Governor in Council to reply to Major Parsons' letters MO.540-X, dated the llth March and Elst April 1927, inviting the views of the Government ol Bombay on the draft Abyssinia (Amendment) Order in Council, 1927. (1) On Articles 1, 2 and 4 of the proposed draft the Government of Bombay have no remarks to offer. (2) As regards Article 5, as British Courts in India can award 14 years imprisonment under the Indian Penal code, e.g. section 392, it seems desirable that the Courts in Abyssinia should have the power of awarding 14 instead of 10 years imprisonment as proposed in this Article. (5) As regards Article 5, 'Bombay* should be omitted , , ^ ar , d (o) as in the Foreign and Political from clauses (1) a t.w» HO.909-3, dat.l a&gt;' 29U &gt; M 1M5, *' Government Indie pointed out te the Secretary el St... + -r tbp Indian Prisoners Act III ot 1900 that the amendment oi the max a + lp ^ lise the detention at Bombay of prisoners with a view to legalise me convicted and sentenced before any Court in Abyssinia would require legislation in the Central Legislature and that they would be very loath to undertake it. u Jf ( 4) with reference to Articles 6 and 7 which propose to empower the High Court of Bombay to dispose of appeals m Civil and Criminal cases arising in the Abyssinia Courts the Honourable the Chief Justice and Judges of the Bombay High Court object to this proposal on the ground that they are already overworked and that it is not right that the Indian tax-payer should be charged for the disposal of cases coming from Abyssinia. Ae regards overwork the complaints of the High Court are reserving the attention of the Government of Bombay.

As a result of the report of the Indian Jails Committee the Governor General in Connci proposes to abolish transportation as a form of judicial punishment, and the Bill is designed to give effect to this decision. Sentences of transportation under the various laws concerned are usually admissible as alternatives to some other form of punishment. These alternatives are so various that it has been decided that the only practicable method of proceeding is to fix in the case of each offence the sentence of imprisonment which shall be substituted for a sentence of transportation for life or for a less period, if such less period is specified. In doing this it has been desired to retain generally the view of the Legislature as to the relative gravity of each offence when it enacted the law in question. 2. The Bill does not deal with sentences of transportation which maybe imposed under any local Act in force in any province in which a local Legislature has been constituted or under any Regulation. Such local Acts and Regulations are left to be dealt with by the local Legislature concerned and by the Governor General in Council under their respective legislative powers. 3. So far as Acts of general application are concerned, the Bill proposes to remove all references to transportation save where the retention of such references is necessary because of the possibility of a sentence of transportation having been passed before and being stU m force when the Bill comes into operation. These references will in due course become spent, and they will then be repealed in Repealing and Amending Acts. 4. With the abolition of sentences of transportation provision for.sentences of penal servi tude is also in a large measure unnecessary. In view of the provisions of section 66 of the Government of India Act, it is, however, necessary to retain penal servitude as a form ot punishment under the Indian Marine Act, 1887 , and this and the point mentioned m para graph 3 of this Statement are the reasons for^the retention of references to penal servitude in Acts of general application.

Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt on the 12th instant of your despatch No.407 (J 323 q/ 2/1) of the 13th ultimo forwarding for my observations draft of an amending Abyssinia Order in Council. 2 • I showed the draft to His Majesty's Consul and directed him to show it to Mr. A *L .Gardiner, LL.D., the British Barrister at Addis Ababa. I now have the honour to transmit herewith a minute from Mr.Maclean giving his observations after discussing the matter with Mr.Gardiner and myself. I am in agreement with Mr.Maclean's minute. 3 . I have the honour to draw particular attention to Mr. Maclean's suggestion that the limit of 10 years' imprisonment in substitution for the death sentence might be too short in certain very grave cases. I think the limit should be 20 or possibly 25 years. If you. Sir, consider this too long a term for H.M. Consul-General to be allowed to inflict, might not the interests of the criminal be guarded by retention of Article 52 of the Principal Order in Council o± December 19, 1913 and so modifying this article as to meet the case of any sentence exceeding 10 years? This might be done as follows '52 (1) Where any person is considered by the Court The Rt. Hon. Sir Austen Chamberlain, K.G*, etc., etc., etc..■«r- of H*M* Consul-General to merit a sentence exceeding ten years, the Consul-General shall forthwith send a report of the case with a copy of the minutes of the proceedings and notes of evidence in the case and with and observations he thinks fit, to the Secretary of State. '( 2 ) remains as written. ”(3) The Secretary of State shall direct what punishment is to be inflicted on the person convicted, and the person convicted shall be punished accordingly. ”(4) In such a case no appeal shall lie to the High Court of Judicature at Bombay ,1 . 4. As regards the draft enclosed in your despatch under reply, I assume that on page 3, (3 lines from the bottom) for 'in any other place', we should read 'in any other cas e', and on page 5 (8 lines from the bottom) for 'or on his own hand', we should read 'or in his own bond '. I have, etc., (Sgd) C.H. Bentinck.Enclosure in Addis Absba despatch No* 27 dated 20'*i _ 19‘ :; '7# Addis Ababa. 19th January, 1927. H. M. Minister . X have spoken to Gardiner on the subject of the proposed revision of the Order in Council and submit the following observations:- A. Gardiner considers, and I agree with him, that the limit of 10 years imprisonment in substitution of the death sentence is too light. In England, when a death sentence is commuted I think it is invariably penal servitude for life, and X do not think that such a light punishment for a deliberate murder exists under any code. This limit of 10 years would scarcely act as a deterrent to murder and would tie our hands unduly in the event of any very flagrant case occurring. It would also make it impossible to demand fitting punishment of an Abyssinian who murdered a British subject. I'suggest therefore that if the Government does not wish to give us discretion up to a life sentence, that the limit should be at least 20 years. As an alternative, in cases of High Treason, fcrder or other grave offences, the Court of the Consul General might convict, and remit the prisoner, and the full records of the case to the High Court at Bombay for sentence to be delivered - but this alternative is clumsy and I do not favour it. B. Nothing is said about appeals to the Privy Council from the Bombay High Court in Criminal cases, though provision is made for this in civil matters. I wonder whether*’ w ' whether this is an oversight, or deliberate. I consider that such appeals should toe allowed in cases where they are allowed in purely Indian cases. It may toe that this power is implied in the new article 76 (VIII) tout it is not clear. C. As regards Rules of Court I do not consider that any new rules are needed for Procedure and Forms : there are I think sufficiently provided for toy Rule 4 in the n Rules of Court No.1 of 1916”. Possibly there might toe an advantage in specifically applying, toy Rules of Court, the limitation laid down in the Indian Limitation Act of 1908 to the Consul General 1 s Court as thus:- (see first schedule, second division; appeals) • Art. 150 From a maximum sentence.

VSl to have a set form, which I doubt, the Court at Bombay might be asked to provide a draft of the form generally used there As regards Pees there will have to be an addendum to the Rules of Court. Here I would suggest that Fees Nos.49 50 and 51 in Rules of Court No.l of 1922 be repealed and the following substituted 'On appeal to the High Court of Judicature at Bombay. In Civil matter s. 49.

No.3568^15.^ dated the 14th June 1926. uith reference to the correspondence ending with the letter from the Government of India in the Foreign and i olitical Depart ment, No.340-X.., dated the 4th Larch 1926, regarding the detention at aden of persons convicted by an Abyssinian kixed Gourt, I am direct ( 3 d by the Governor in Council to propose under section 71(1) of the Gove mi lent of India Act, 1915, to the Governor General in Council the accompanying draft regulation. 2. The reason for proposing this draft regulation is the necessity of enabling sentences passed by any Court or tribunal in Abyssinia to bo served in Aden. 3. The Inspector General of Irisone, Bombay I residency, suggests the desirability of adding to the draft regulation an amendment of section 18 of the a ns on ers ret. III of 196C , to enable } ersons sentenced to death by rbyosinian Courts to be executed at Aden, because lie considers that the wording of the first three lines of section 15 of the Act is to some extent ambiguous find authorises detention only. The Government of Bombay considers that the view of the Ins actor General of Arisons, stated above is not correct. Bection 18 of the i r is oners act a ] lies, to territory beyond the limits of British India over which the Governor General in vouncil has jurisdiction, while section 15(1) of the act allies to all the Courts in territory where the Governor Genera] in Council may or laav not have jurisdiction.

It will be observed that Articles 2 and 5 deal with subjects which have already been discussed at length in previous correspondence. Articles 6 and 7 on the other hand contemplate the institution of an appeal from the Court of His Majesty's Consul General at Addis Ababa to the High Court of Judicature at Bombay. Sir Austen Chamberlain was led to put forward this suggestion for the reasons set forth in the enclosed despatch to Mr.Bentinck of the 10th June 1925. The proposal, however, in that despatch that appeals should go from Abyssinia to Alexandria was found on further investigation to be impracticable. 3. I am to invite Lord Birkenhead's concurrence m the proposed procedure and to request that Sir Austen Chamberlain may be favoured with His Lordship’s observations in detail on the provisions of the proposed amending Order in Council. 4. In Article 3 of the draft Order the Consular Court in Abyssinia is deprived of the power of inflicting a i The Under-Secretary of State, India office.a sentence of death. Sir Austen Chamberlain has no doubt that this amendment is desirable. 5. The sentence of transportation for life does not seem suitable for the circumstances of a Consular Court in Abyssinia which has no power to award penal servitude under the principal order. In these circumstances the maximum penalty that this Court can award must be some term of imprisonment. The maximum of ’’ten years” in the draft order is inserted because it appears that this is the longest period of imprisonment which can be awarded under the Indian penal Code by a Court in British India. On the other hand Courts in British India can award for the most serious crimes sentences of death, transportation and penal servitude. Sir Austen Chamberlain would welcome the observations of Lord Birkenhead on the question whether in the circumstances the Court in Abyssinia could or should be given the power to award a longer term of imprisonment than ten years and, if so, subject to what conditions, I am. Sir, Your obedient Servant,1 1405 No. 79. J 1500/1500/1] Mr. Austen C hamberlain to Mr. Bent inch (Addis Ababa). No. 103.) Foreign Office, June 10, 1925. I HAVE to inform you that your predecessor has called my attention to certain onsiderations in relation to the working of exterritorial jurisdiction in Abyssinia aider the Order in Council of 1913. 9 .. The nresent position, at any rate as regards important criminal cases, does not tppear to be'wholly satisfactory, seeing that the officers holding the courts are naturally lot trained lawyers, and that there is no body of English lawyers in ^Addis Ababa to •epresent the litigants and assist the court by their arguments. The judge has not wen the advantage of a jury, and, moreover, is empowered to disregard the opinion of he assessors who sit with him in serious cases. . 3. These facts were, of course, realised at the time when the Order m Council was ssued, but it was not anticipated that the court would be called on to hear any but jomparatively minor matters. Eecent experience, however, has shown that cases ot very serious crimes mav not infrequently have to be tried by. the court, and that it is lifficult to make use in practice of the provisions under which such cases can be tried it Bombay or Aden. From the court of the consul-general, which is alone competent :o try serious criminal cases, there is at present no appeal except by special leave ot the Privy Council, which, as is well known, that court is very slow to g^ ve -_ ® re ? U f&gt; diat a man who has not been defended by counsel may be convicted ot murder before i judge with no legal training, without a jury and without any appeal, buch a situation .s obviously not satisfactory. . . 4. It has been suggested that the record of the proceedings in important cases should be sent to this Department and the whole case examined by the Legal Aaviseis out I do not consider that this would be a satisfactory solution. It is very ditticuit form a useful opinion on cases of this sort merely from reading a paper recoi o trial, and the less complete such record is, owing to the absence of counsel on each s_ and consequently of full examination and cross-examination, tie giea ei 18 . is. Further, the only action which could be taken, if . such an mvest gation were considered to show that action was required, would be mitiga ion or lemis sentence under article 57, or the exercise, of the prerogative o par on, w • by article 58. Neither of these remedies is really adequate in a case w . er . ^ ought never to have been convicted at all. Murder cases w ere . e P i sentenced to death would, in any case, be examined m the Foreign Office u article 52. 5 . It seems to me that the best course would be to g 1 ^ 6 an appe • j s w h ere from the court of the consul-general to a court composed o pro essimr J a court can the case could be argued by competent lawyers on each side, an( ^ o r Her in be found in the Full Court at Alexandria established under the E yp ^ aud Council. This court is composed of the Chief Justice of the u a = There is newer the judge of the consular court, and there is an adequate ai aval a . lifHculties to provide such an appeal under section 9 of the Fonng 11 ^'L^ibjkve ; ’one difficulty of communication, though considerable, are, I understan , P (Wrt does is that, owing to the distance between Khartum and Affixandna the Ful Court do^ not sit very often, and a considerable period might some imes e ap doubt be could be heard, but if this difficulty proved serious in practice it could no douffibe remedied. An appeal might be given as of “n questions of fact or of leave of the court of the consul-general, or of the r ul i mixed law and fact, or against the sentence passed. ^ ^ [13646]6 The situation is not so difficult as regards civil cases, partly because, as a ru they are not important, and also because the appeal to the Privy Council provide* m adequate remedy in serious cases.

The Inspector General of Paulsons, Bombay Presiuency, suggests the desirability of ^i^ to the draft Regulation an amendment of section IB of the Prisoners Act, III oi 1900, to enable persons sentenced to death by Abyssinian Courts to be executed at Aden, because he considers that the wording of the first three lines of section 15 of tne Act is to some extent ambiguous and authorises detention only. The Government of Bombay considers that the view of the Inspector General of Prisons, stated above is not correct. Section 18 of the Prisoners Act applies to terri tory beyond the limits of British India over which the Governor General in Council has jurisdiction, while section 15(1) of the Act applies to all the Courts in territory where the Governor General in Council may or may not have jurisdic tion. As Abyssinia is not under the control of the Governor i General in Council, section 18 of the Act does not apply. ^4In this connection I am to invite the attention of the Government of India to paragraph 2 of Mr. Hotson's letter Ho.3589-1.B., dated the 13th November 1925, which gives the reasons why the Government of Bombay accepted the view of the Advocate General, Bombay, that section 15(l) of the Prisoners Act applies to all kinds of sentences including the execution of a sentence of death* Whereas it is expedient to amend the Aden Laws Regulation, 1891, for the purpose herein after appearing; It is hereby enacted as follows 1 . Tliis Regulation may be called the Aden Laws (Amendment) Regulation, 1926* 2* After section 4 of the Aden Laws Regula- Insertion of new tion, 1891, the followiiig section 4A in Regulation II of section shall be inserted, 1891. namely 4A.

( y&gt;' Foreign Office. i s.w.i. 22nd September, 1926 .fb^ With reference to the opinion of the haw Officers which was transmitted to you in Foreign Office letter of the 18th May under ho. 950 / 2 / 1 , I am directed hy Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain to inform you that consideration has been given in this department to the application of the Colonial Prisoners Removal Act of 1884 to prisoners convicted by the Mixed Court in Abyssinia. 2. The Colonial Office have stated that steps were being taken for the issue of an Order in Council extending the application of the Colonial Prisoners Removal Act of 1884 to the Somaliland Protectorate. This will render legal the removal of Somali prisoners convicted by the Mixed Court to the protectorate. In your letter ho. P 756 Oi. the 20th March, 1926, you state that you have invited the G-overnrnent of India to agree to analogous measures which when enacted will make it possible to move Indian prisoners to Aden or Bombay. 3. As regards the places to which such convicted prisoners are to be sent, Article 56 of the Abyssinia Order in Council, as it will be when amended in the form approved ty the law Officers, will provide for the removal to Bombay, Aden, Berbers and tialta of persons convicted in the Consular Courts under Section 7 of the i'oreipn Jurisdiction Act. It would seem that persons convicted before the Mixed Court should, under the macninerj 0l - tne Colonial..•. The Under Secretary of State, India Office. it £3 SEP kW- ■- , -y V' s/&gt;, h; ! Ill 117 —m r )C\ v- iV- x Colonial Prisoners Removal Act, 'be sent to the same places. As regards distribution, Sir Austen Chamberlain would suggest that a,ll British Somalis from Somaliland should be sent to Berbera, all British Indians to Aden and all other British subjects to Malta, Section 11 (l) of the Act provides that “the cost of the removal of any “prisoner under this Act and of his maintenance while in 'confinement and of his return and of his being sent after “discharge to any place shall be paid in such manner as “may be arranged between the Governments of the British “possessions concerned and the Secretary oi &gt;'_&gt;caoe, suojecw “as regards any cost to be paid out 01 monies pxoviced “by Parliament to the consent of the Commissionei s xoi 'His Majesty's Treasury.' It appears from your letter Ho. P 756 of the 20th March last that the Government of India will bear the cost of the detention of Br.itish Indians at Aden. Sir Austen Chamberlain presumes that the oomaxilanu Government will in the same way bear the expense of British Somalis sent to Berbera whose Somali nationality has previously been proved to the satisfaction othe Governor. In the case of a person sent to Malta, it would appear that the Maltese Government should be liable for those persons whom they recognise as Maltese British subjects. In all other oases the expense would be borne by the Imperial Government. This procedure would appear to be in conformity with the principles underlying the arrangement made in 1889 regarding the expenses of trial and maintenance of consular prisoners from Morocco, 4,,,.. *4 . Sir Austen Charnberlain will be glad to learn whether Lord Birhenhead concurs generally in the proposed procedure, Mr. Bentinck can then be consulted ana the appropriate instructions issued to the Charge d*Affaires at Addis Ababa.

From: - British Charge d'Affaires, Deportation of Haroon Jaleh from Abyssinia to Aden. iiddis Ababa Despatch No.163 July 9th,1926. (Enclosure in original)COPY. lfo.163 Addis Ab&amp;b&amp;, 9th July,1926. Sir, ■ ' i (i I iu&gt;ve the honour to transmit herev/ith copy of the records of Criminal case iJo.3 of 1926 in which I have sentenced the prisoner to deportation from Abyssinia under Section 73 of the Abyssinian Order in Council. Haroon Saleh has been preyiousiy guilty of breaches of the peace, and is a man of thoroughly bad character. I enclose herewith copy of a minute made by Mr. Consul Home on an occasion when Haroon Saleh was handed over to him by the Abyssi-nian authorities for maltreating a woman. He is furthermore much addicted to drink. I enclose herewith a copy of a medico-legal certificate from the medical officer of this Legation, to gether with a statement signed by various British subjects here. Haroon Saleh by descent a Yemen Jew is j^Qg^Q-^gyed as having been born at Aden in 1867 and has received a passport Ho.147 from this Consulate dated 13th May 1924, which however appears to have been mislaid. I therefore have the honour to request your sanction for the deportation of this man to Aden, and as it does not appear that he has sufficient meanstb pay the expenses thereof, I would also be grateful for authority to charge these to public funds. A copy of this despatch is being sent to Aden. I have etc., (Sgd) a.T.Maclean. The Bt.Hon. Sir Austen Chamberlain,K.C.♦ etc., etc•, etc.,COPY. CRILUHiiL CASE RO: 3 OP 1926. 0 O 0 O 0 YahodA Shileray (represented by Mr.A.L,Gardiner,M.A., • LL.B., Barrister-at-Law) So Haroon Saleh both present. •oOo. Mr, fflardlner opening ease says eomplaint is before Court and asks complainant to be put on oath, Yahoda Shilemy duly affirmed (Jew) states On July 1st at about 6 p.m, he went out to look for a tin of paraffin and entered the shop of Salem Finhos He found Haroon Saleh sitting there, who asked him why he prevented him from entering the Synagogue, which is situated in the compound of Shilemy. The complainant replied that he had been adjudged a troublesome fellow and for that reason he was not allowed in the Synagogue. Upon this prisoner began insulting him and his father and mother etc. then took off his coat and got up to beat him. Another Jew seized Haroon Saleh to prevent him attacking, but was not strong enough. Shilemy managed to escape from the shop and ran to his own compound followed by his servant. Prisoner caught up with the servant, pushed him aside, followed Shilemy into the compound and kicked him twice on the hand and in the stomach. Attracted by the noise Ato Kassa Detective entered the compound accompanied by another employee of the Municipality, separated the combatants and tooK prisoner out; prisoner meanwhile threatening to shoot one of the Jewish community. As Shilemy knew prisoner had a revolver they went at once to report to 3-eraz Saleh. Shilemy did not know for certain that prisoner possessed a revolver, but suspected it. Afterwards Shilemy went to a doctor and got a medieval certific ate. Certificate /Certificate read out by Court. Mr. Gardiner asks. When Haroon threatened to shoot did Shilemy think he was a man likely to carry out threat. Answer:- His reputation among Jewish Community is that of a dangerous man. CROSS iilXAUIHilD BY PRISONER : Is not Church established for 7 years now and is it not for the benefit of all Jews? The Jewish Community have the right to exclude anyone from the Church which is entirely a private place of worship, not a public church. Is not my subscription received every week ? Ocaasional sums have been received, but all subscriptions are voluntary. Did you (complainant) exclude Hassan Malaki from the Community ? &amp; Yes, because he was drunkard. Also this has /\ been done with other persons. What reason have you for preventing me from entering the Church? First he was excluded owing to a quarrel with a woman, and then he was allowed in again* Then he protested against the exelusion of Suliman, and he was excluded for unwarranted interference. Is it not a rule that unless a man makes disturbance within the Church he is not to be excluded. No. There is no such rule - it is a private p ace for prayer and the owner of the house can do as he likes. Did you not cause Gur^jies to beat me on Thursday ? (July 1st). •When my servants (Surajies) saw prisoner taking off his coat they pushed in upon him. Did you not report the Court that I threatened you with a revolver? x e s« ] iiWitness Mesha Josef, duly affirmed. Mr. Gardiner , Did witness see the assault? Answer:- He was in his shop and did not actually see blow. Does witness know anything of matter ? Answer: He happened to be in the shop when Shilemy came for paraffin, made the purchase, told his boy to take the case of paraffin, whereupon prisoner who was sitting there said 'Do you mean to s^y you have such a strong servant' ? Shilemy replied that it did not concern him. Prisoner then began abusing Shilemy calling him insulting names. Witness did not hear any arguments about Church matters, Shilemy went out of the shop, and witness caught prisoner, trying to prevent him leaving shop, but did not succeed and prisoner ran out of shop. Witness remained in shop until owner returned about 5 minutes later and he went out and saw prisoner being pushed by Abyssinians, He is a Jew, lives in Djibouti - is in Addis Abeba for a law case. Kmews Haroon Saleh by reputation as a trouble maker. OKOaS EXAM IHi£D 3Y PRISONhK . Did not Shilemy begin when he entered shop by saying to me 'you cannot enter Church again' ? Answer:- First Haroon Saleh made remark about servants, 2 nd,Shilemy replied that that did not concern him. 3rd. Haroon began insulting remarks. Did Shilemy try to beat me ? Reply. No. I did not see. Did Shilemy’s servant beat me on my bacK ? Reply - No. I did not see. Adjourned to July 7th. 7.7.26.7,7.1926. Ato Kfc-ss&amp;. Police detective duly sworn state At about 5 on the afternoon of July 1st, he left his house and came along the road leading past Shilemy T s compound, and hearing loud abuse in Arabic he stopped his rftule. He saw the two insulting each other. Suddenly Haroon ran backward out of the compound and continued to abuse Shilemy with abuse which in Arabic is very serious. Then one of the gate keepers of Benins, threw off his cloak and ran after Haroon and struck him. Upon which he mounted his mile and came up and caught h°lcl of Haroon to protect him from the gatekeeper. After handing over Haroon to another constable he arrested the gatekeeper, but. did not Jseep him under arrest, his object being merely to keep the combatantsapart. He asked the gatekeeper why he beat a foreigner, and the reply was that he had made a quarrel with his master. He wished to take the gatekeeper to prison, but Shilemy said he would be responsible for his servant. Haroon being in charge of a policeman, broke away suddenly and ran to Shilemy and kicked him in the stomach. Shileray appeared to be very badly hurt and for the moment he thought he would die. He (witness) then pulled Haroon away noticing then that hisclothes were torn. Haroon ran to his house, the Detective following. Haroon wished to come out again, but the Detective prevented this, asking why he wanted to do so. Haroon said he wanted to shoot u Shilemy. He therefore left a constable on guard over Harbon in his house and went and reported to his Chief. Examined by * Cardiner # He is a detective. Everybody knows that Haroon is a very bad character. He is always quarrelling and makes trohble with everybody. ThisThis is established by the records of the police and the Special Court, axtr.ined by Prisoner , Were we not both abusing each other ? Yes. Did you see Shilemy lift his foot to kick me? No. Did the gate keeper come for me direct or did I insult him? He came for you direct. Did the gate keeper beat me badly ? No. I prevented him. Where was Shilemy when the gate keeper was beating me? He was then present. When I said that I would shoot Shilemy, did you see any revolver ? No. Did the constable you left on guard remain during the night? I left him to keep the peace and do not know how long he remained. Tashoma duly sworn says:- He is a detective under Ato Kassa. On Thursday he saw something of the trouble between Saroon and Shilemy. He does not know Arabic. He arrived with Ato.Kassa and saw the same as him. He saw them talking then he saw the gate keeper run at Haroon and beat him, the latter falling on the ground* He took hold of Haroon and Ato Kassa took the gate keeper and sent him into his compound. Haroon broke from my hold and ran and kicked Shilemy he saw him kick in the hand and dollars he was holding were scattered. Then Haroon ran to his house, and attempted to come out again, but Ato.Kassa prevented him, putting a constable o n guard. He does not anything of the character of Haroon Saleh. Questie^eH by Prisoner . Did I speak with ato Kassa in Arabic or Aijiharic ? Both. Did you see anything in my hand when I came out of the house ? No. I&amp;eyush Auwan.Ueyiish Auw&amp;n duly wworn. Question by prisoner. He w^s in the shop of Meyush and left it to go to the compound of Shilemy because he heard the noise of the fight. He saw Haroon enter the compound and kick Shilemy and money was/scattered from his hand on the ground. The kick was in the stomach. Shilemy picked up his money and said he had lost one dollar. They were separated by Ato Kassa and Baroon went running to his house. Erfeoner. Were you there when the gatekeeper beat me.? Ho. Questioned by Mr. Oardiner . When you heard the noise could you hear words ? No. What are you ? Just a temporary visitor from Asmara. Questioned by Court. The kick appeared to inflict pain; but did not seem very serious. Shilemy said n Ah' and held his stomach when he received it, but afterwards seemed all right. Mr. Grardiner . Evidence so plain that comment not necessary. Asks for conviction under section 323 of Indian Penal Code for infliction of bodily hurt and also under the Abyssinian Order in Council for deportation. Prisoner refers to the matter of the Synagogue from which he was ejected, and says that the blame for the quarrel rests on Shilemy. He admits having kicked Shilemy but says that on account of the beating by the gate keeper he was nervous. As regards the revolver, it was one he had had in his house j or 7 months. He had no intention of shooting Shilemy with it. 0 O 0 — ' Judgment.Complaint was made by Jahoda Shilemy, a Jew, against Haroon i&gt;aleh a Jew, that he had inflicted bodily hurt by kicking him. The evidence called by both parties showed that the quarrel had its origin in religious matters, prisoner having been excluded from the Jewish place of worship by complainant, who is the agent of the owner of the property in which the place of worship is, this being private property. The evidence is also conclusive that prisoner did actually severely kick complainant• For this offence I sentence prisoner under Section 323 of the IHDlalf PMAL CODE to three months imprisonment. Furthermore, inasmuch as prisoner was in September 1925 bound over on security by Mr.Consul Home to keep the peace, and has by this offence failed to do so, I direct that he shall be deported to Aden on the conclusion of his sentence. ritish Consulate, ) ddis Ababa, ) uly 7th, 192 q. ) (Sd.) - G.T.Maclean, H.B.M.

Sir, With reference to the letter from this department of the 10th March regarding the place of detention of British subjects convicted in Abyssinia, I am directed by Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain to request you to lay before the Earl of Birkenhead the accompanying copy of the report on this subject given by the Law Officers of the Crown and to request that this report may be treated as highly confidential 2. It will be seen that the Lew Officers do not consider that the proposed amendment of article 35 of the Abyssinian Order in Council is a satisfactory method of dealing with the difficulty and they express the opinion that the points at issue can be dealt with under section 2 (d' of the Prisoners Removal Act 1884, which has been applied to Abyssinia by paragraph 79 of the principal Order. 3. Subject to any observations which the Earl of Birkenhead may desire to make, Sir A. Chamberlain proposes to proceed with the issue of the proposed article to replace article 56, and to instruct His Majesty^ Minister at Adais Ababa to deal with the removal of prisoners under article 35 in the manner prescribed by the Prisoners Removal Act ox 1884. I am, Si r, Your obedient Servant,[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government. 1 ABYSSINIA. [J 950/2/1/1926] subjects in Abyssinia. No. . [April 22, 1926.] Foreign Office to the Law Officers of the Crown. Gentlemen, Foreign Office, March 9, 1926. * I HAVE the honour, Indirection of Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain, to request Jurisdicticn the favour of your advice on a point which has arisen in connection with the exercise ov ®r lint V tJ of His Majesty’s rights of jurisdiction over British subjects in Abyssinia. 2. The extent of that jurisdiction is less well-defined in Abyssinia than it is in plher countries, and rests largely upon usage. His Majesty’s Government have, however, always claimed and obtained the benefits of article 7 of the Frauco-Abyssinian Treaty of Commerce of the 10th January, 1908, the text of which will be found in the memorandum enclosed as Paper A. It will be seen that the system of jurisdiction provided by that treaty for criminal cases between French citizens and Abyssinian subjects provides for such cases being heard by an Abyssinian magistrate^assisted by a French consul. This system differs, as regards cases where a European is defendant or accused, from that which exists in other countries where the system of extra territoriality prevails, since in those countries the rule is that the competent Court is that of the accused’s nationality. The Tribunal established, under the Franco- Abyssinian Treaty is known as the “ Mixed Court ” ; its constitution and procedure are somewhat indeterminate, but it may be assumed for present purposes that it is not an ordinary Abyssinian Tribunal but a Court possessing an international character set up by treaty, and the principle is well established, as will be seen fiom the memorandum enclosed as Paper A, that criminal cases between British and Abyssinian subjects are tried by that Court and not by the ordinary Abyssinian Tribunals. a. His Majesty’s jurisdiction over British subjects in Abyssinia is exercised m accordance with the Abyssinia Order in Council, 191o, (Paper B) Article 3o of that Order makes provision for the detention m custody of a British subject, either pending his trial or while he is serving his sentence, in cases dealt with by the Mixed Court (the “ Abyssinian Tribunal ” referred to in the article). This is effected either by a separate warrant by the Consular Court or by the Court’s endorsement on the warrant of the Mixed Court. Under that article, however, such detention can only take place in Abyssinia. , . . , , . , 4. Recent cases have shown the necessity of making provision under which British subjects sentenced by the Mixed Court can be sent to serve their sentence in British territory, since there is no British prison in Abyssinia which is suitable lor the reception of* long-term prisoners, while the conditions, of imprisonment m Abyssinian gaols are such that it is not possible to consent to British sub]ects convicted before the Mixed Court serving their sentences therein. In the case of British subjects convicted before the Consular Court, provision is made by article o 0 a^ 61 (under section 7 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890) for imprisonment at Aden Bombav or Malta. In view of the fact, however, that section 7 of the Act is confined to the case of offenders “ convicted before a British Court in a foreign coun ry, i is not possible to make provision under that section for persons conyic ec e °^ G ] e Mixed Court, and the question arises whether, without an amendmen o le c , i is possible to amend the Abyssinia Order in Council in such a way as to provide the eq T d Sterns to be no difficulty as regards legalising the detention of the persons in question in prison after their arrival at the Britis i possession o \wk i they are to be sent; this can be effected by local legislation, of which the India Office and Colonial Office respectively are prepared to obtain the enactmen . 1 ^ arises as regards the detention of the persons '.'oncerned m custo yin jssmia oi , their removal from that country and on their way from A yssima o le p ace o imprisonment. It has been proposed to effect this by making use o ne pioyisi of section 8 of the Act, and an article, of which a copy is enclosed (Paper C), amenta i 0 2856—13 [14492]i 2 ABYSSINIA. article 35 of the Abyssinia Order in Council, has been piepa,red^ for this purpose. Section 8 of the Act is the one on which are based the provisions in boreign Jurisdiction Orders in Council providing for deportation (see, e.g., article^ 73 of the Abyssinia Order) and in view of the fact that the word “ removal is used as well as “deportation” in the section in question, it is suggested that the section provides sufficient authority for the proposed amendment of article 35. It cannot, however, be $ denied that the effect of the proposed amendment would be to use section 8 to give power to do that which cannot be done under section /, and doubts have accordingly been expressed as to whether, in the event of the lawfulness of the detention in custody of a convicted prisoner on his way from Abyssinia to Aden or Berbera being questioned before a competent Court, the piovision in question would be upheld. 6. It has been suggested that an alternative method would be to deal with the cases in question under the Colonial Prisoners Removal Act, 1884, which was applied by article 79 of the Abyssinia Order in Council, 1913, to Abyssinia as if Abyssinia were a British possession, with the substitution of the Consul-General for the Governor of a British possession. Ro such express limitation as that contained in section 7 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act (the words “convicted before a British Court in a foreign country ”) is involved, and it is suggested that it could be argued that, even if the Mixed' Court is technically an Abyssinian Tribunal, it is nevertheless exercising His Majesty’s jurisdiction in the case contemplated ; that it would, therefore, not be improper that persons convicted by it should be removed under the Act, and that there is nothing in the Act or in its application by article 79 to Abyssinia to prevent this being done. 7. If neither of these two courses can be adopted, it would appear that no power exists to make the necessary provision except by obtaining an amendment of section 7 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act so as to make it applicable to British subjects convicted before tribunals of the nature of the Mixed Court, a proceeding to which it is presumed there would be no legal objection. 8. I am also to transmit for your consideration the draft of an article (Paper D) to replace article 56 of the Abyssinia Order in Council, 1913, under which offenders convicted before tLe Consular Court can be sent for imprisonment to Aden, Bombay or Malta. The object of the new article is merely 7 to add Berbera to the places in question, but, inasmuch as Berbera is in a protectorate and is not therefore “a place within His Majesty’s dominions,” it has been necessary to reword the existing article 56. 9. In these circumstances, I am to request you to take the enclosed papers into y T our consideration and to favour Sir Austen Chamberlain with your opinion on the followdng points :— (1.) Whether the terms of the proposed article to replace article 56 of the Abyssinia Order in Council (Paper D) are lit and proper to be submitted for His Majesty’s approval ? (2.) Whether the proposed amendment of article 35 of the Abyssinia Order in Council (Paper C) affords a satisfactory method of dealing with the situation described in paragraphs 2-4 above, and can properly be submitted for His Majesty’s approval ? (3.) In the event of y r our answer to question (2) being in the negative, whether the alternative method suggested in paragraph 6 above can properly be adopted ? In the event of your being unable to advise the acceptance of either of the two suggested courses, Sir Austen Chamberlain would be grateful for any alternative suggestions which you may be able to offer as to the means to be adopted for dealing with the question.

(1.) Our answer to the first question proposed is in the affirmative. (2) and (3). We do not think that the proposed amendment to article 35 affords a s-^hsfactory method of dealing with the situation described in the letter under replv. our opinion, sections 7 and 8 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890, deal with two contrasted situations. Section 7 is designed to deal with the case of convicted offenders; section 8 is directed to the case of persons who have not been convicted and sentenced, but whose removal or deportation has been ordered under powers such as those afforded by paragraph 73 of the Abyssinia Order in Council. We do not, therefore, consider that section 8 is apt to deal with the difficulty arising in the case of convicted offenders. We think, however, that a provision might he made by the alternative methods suggested in the Foreign Office letter, namely, by dealing with cases under section 2 of the Prisoners Removal Act, 1884. That Act has been applied to Abyssinia by paragraph 79 of the Abyssinia Order in Council; and the case seems tons to fall within section 2 (d) of the Act. We have nothing to add.

PQRSI® OFFICE. S.W.l. 24th February, 192 6 . Sir, With reference to the letter from this department of the 14th ultimo regarding British Somalis in Abyssinia, I am directed by Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain to request you to lay before Mr. Secretary Amery the accompanying copy of a despatch on this subject from His Majesty's Minister at Addis Ababa which crossed that enclosed in this department's letter under reference. 2. In the present despatch Mr. Ben tin ck furnishes his observations both as regards the proposed system of compulsory registration and as regards the status of the 9 Habr-Awal, Gadabursi and Esa Somalis. As to registration, Sir Austen Chamberlain inclines to the view -that only those who have had actual experience of dealing with this work in His Majesty's Consulates in Abyssinia are really competent to form an opinion of what can or cannot be done. He would suggest that the point could best be discussed at an interdepartmental meeting vhen Mr. Ben tin ck is on leave in June or July, at #iich perhaps the Governor or Assistant Governor of Somaliland might be present if in England. 3. It will be remembered that an interdepartmental conference, whose recommendations were embodied in your letter No. 3 6 627 of the 23rd July, 1919, considered the problem of the Gadabursi in 1919. It was then decided that Hie Under-Secretary of State, Colonial Office.that His Majesty’s Governmentshould adhere to their contention which they had already upheld as against the authorities of French Somaliland that the Gadabursi tribe, having a treaty of peace and friendship with His Majesty’s Government, should not be liable to taxation by the Abyssinians when grazing on the Abyssinian side of the frontier. It is possible that the records in your department of the actual discussion at this meeting may throw further li#t on the reasons which prompted this decision which apparently conflicted with the views previously expressed by the Somaliland Government and by His Majesty’s Minister at Addis Ababa. In any event and having regard to the defacto situation as disclosed by Mr. Plowman, I am to enquire whether in Mr. Amery’ s opinion it would be desirable to reexamine the possibility of regularising the status of the tribes in question byV ». 225# r 269/2/1), Addis iibaba# 22nd December, 1925 Sir, 1 hove the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch Bo# 280 U 3299/681/1) of the 19th ultimo on the subject of the registration of British Somalia* My des pot ch Bo* 120 of August 29th will show that all British subjects aro urged to register et the nearest British consul, ate, but my despatch bo* 161 of October 16t'h will show that this is not always easy in the cade of penniless British ■ r ails living several days* journey fro?!, the nearest Brltial consulate, and whose low $t if if Intelligence cannot always be expected to grasp the importune® of this tr&gt;ublesome and, for some of them, costly system.

Mr.Amery is advised that there should, in fact, be very little delay in dealing with cases under the Colonial Prisoners’ Removal Act, 1884, as, in modern practice, all the preliminaries to removal can be arranged by telegraph between the Secretary of State and the Governments concerned. Thus, in the cases now contemplated, on receiving a request to that effect from your Department, the Secretary of State for the Colonies would telegraph cretary of estate Foreign Office.OB) to the Governor of Somaliland anc the latter could telegraph his consent to the proposed removal. Then, as soon as the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had signed the order of removal and telegraphed to the Consul-General that he had cone so, the latter would be able forthwith to send the prisoner to Berbera, the escort taking the Consul-General ! s notification of concurrence and Removal Warrant. The actual despatch of the order of Removal and the completion of the other formalities laid down in Section 4 of the Order-in-Council of the 9th of September, 1907, could therefore be carried out subsequentlyaaxacm any further communication oi'l ns subject, please quote No. J 309/2/1 . and address— not to any person by name, but to— “The Under-Secretary of State/' Foreign Office, London, S,W. 1.

As regards the draft of the amending Articles which it is proposed to submit to the Law Officers, I am to say that, although the Law Oiiicers’ advice is requested primarily on Article I of tne draft Order in Council (amending Article 35 of the Principal Order) it appears to Mr. Amery desirable that Article 2 of the Draft Order in Council (amending Article 56 of the PrincipsJ. Order) should be placed before them in the form agreed to between the foreign Office o,nd the Colonial Office. In this connection reference is invited to the correspondence Fr.F.O. 23 Dec. noted in the margin. To F.O. 3. With regard to the request in the last para- 7 Jan.

Biitish possession, with the substitution of the Consul-General for the Governor of a British possession. 4. The Act of 1884 is, under section 15, applicable to ’ ,an y P.l ac P. out of His Majesty’s dominions in which His Majesty has jurisdiction*'. Ho such express limita tion as that contained in section 7 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act (of, the words 'convicted before a British Court in a foreign country') is involved, cmo. Mr. Amery is advised that it could be argued that even if the 'Mixed Court' is technically an Abyssinian tribunal, it is, nevertheless, exercising His Majesty’s jurisdiction in the cases contemplated, that it would, therefore, not be improper that persons convicted by it should be removed under the Act, and that there is nothing in the Act or in its application by Article 79 to Abyssinia to prevent this from being done. 5. The Colonial Prisoner’s Removal Act 1884 has not at present been applied to the Somaliland Protectorate but if it were decided to adopt the procedure suggested Mr. Amery would take immediate steps to secure the passing of an Order in Council for that purpose.

Thus, although the Abyaeinian government did not assent to this draft treaty, and no further progress was made in the matter, the principle that 'mixed' oases should be tried in a special court has repeatedly been admitted by us. 6 . It will bo seen from Has Taffari's letter to h. Coppet (French Minister) in A 50£8/50fce/l/l922, that the special or mixed' court established by the Abyseinians in 19E8 was set up in conformity with the Franco- Abyss inian/Abyssinian treaty of 1906, which continued to be applicable to the other legations.

In cases of murder or manslaughter, if either the death, or the criminal act which wholly or partly caused the death, happened within the jurisdiction of a Court acting under this Order, such Court shall have the like jurisdiction over any person to whom this Order applies who is charged either as the principal offender, or as accessory before the fact to murder, or as accessory after the fact to murder or manslaughter, as if both such criminal act and the death had happened within such jurisdiction. 30. Every Court may cause to be appre hended and brought before it any British sub ject being within the district of the Court and charged with having committed a crime or offence within Abyssinia, and deal with the- accused according to the jurisdiction of the Cburt and in conformity with the provisions, of this Order. 31. For the purposes of criminal jurisdic tion, every offence and cause of complaint committed or arising in Abyssinia shall be deemed to have been committed or to have arisen, either in the place where the same actually was committed or arose, or in any place in Abyssinia where the person charged or complained. of happens to be at the time of the institution or commencement of the charge or complaint. 32. —(1.) Where a British subject charged with a crime or offence escapes or removes from the Consular district within which the crime or offence was committed, and is found within another Consular district, the Court within whose district he is found may proceed in the case'to preliminary examination or to trial and punishment (as the case may re quire), in like manner as if the crime or offence had been committed in its own dis trict; or may, on the requisition or with the consent of the Court within whose district the crime or offence was committed, send him in custody to that Court, or require him to give security for his. surrender to that Court, there to answer the charge and to be dealt with ac cording to law. (2.) Where any person is to be so sent in custody, a warrant shall be issued by the Court within whose district he is found, and that warrant shall be sufficient authority to any person to whom it is directed to receive and detain the person therein named, and to- carry him to and deliver him up to the Court within whose district the crime or offence was- committed, according to the warrant. Apprehension and Custody of Accused Persons. 33. —(1.) Where a person accused of an offence is arrested on a warrant issuing out of any Court, he shall be brought before the Court within forty-eight hours after the execu tion of the- warrant, unless in any case cir cumstances unavoidably prevent his being brought before the Court within that time, which circumstances shall be recorded in the Minutes. (2.) In every case he shall be brought be fore the Court as soon as circumstances reasonably admit, and the time and circum stances shall be recorded in the Minutes. 34. —(1.) Where an accused person is in custody, he shall not be remanded at any time for more than seven days, unless circumstances appear to the Court to make it necessary or proper that he should be remanded for a longer time, which circumstances, and the time of remand, shall be recorded in the Minutes. (2.) In no case shall a remand be for more than fourteen days at one time, unless in case of illness of the accused or other case of necessity. 35.

In all other cases the Court shall ad mit the accused to bail unless the Court, hav mg regai d to the circumstances, sees good reason to the contrary, which reason shall be recorded in the Minutes. (3.) The Court of the Consul-General may admit a person to bail, although a Provincial Court has not thought fit to do so. (4.) The accused who is to be admitted to bail either on remand or on or after trial ordered, shall produce such surety or sureties as, in the opinion of the Court, will be sufficient to insure his appearance as and when required, and shall with him or them enter into a recognizance accordingly. 37.—(1.) Where a person is charged with the commission of a crime or offence the cog nizance whereof appertains to the Court, and it is expedient that the crime or offence be in- qmred of, tried, determined, and punished within His Majesty's dominions elsewhere than m England, the accused may (under the if oreign Jurisdiction Act, section f) be sent tor trial to Aden or Bombay. * (2.) Ihe Consul-General may, where it ap pears so expedient, by warrant under his hand and seal, cause the accused to be sent for trial to Aden or Bombay (as the case may require) accordingly. ' (3.) The warrant shall be sufficient authority to any person to whom it is directed o receive and detain the person therein named and to carry him to and deliver him up «&gt; Aden or Bombay (as the case may be), according to the warrant. Ai 4 ') W ? ere 1 an y person is to be so sent to Aden or Bombay, the Court before which he is cyarged shall take the preliminary examina tion, and shall bind over such of the proper itnesses as are British subjects in their own t -~ s to a Ppear and give evidence on A1 !, crime . s which ^ British India tln'o hA 3 s . la ’ subject to the provisions of witW^T’ bG tned by the Consul-General, with an Assessor or Assessors. orWW • Consul-General shall have an 2“ .

(2.) In other cases the Court shall, subject to the provisions of this Order, hear and deter- mi An a Char ^ e aild with Assessors. (i.) Where the crime or offence with which an accused person is charged before a Provincial Court appears to the Court to be such that, if proved, it would not be ade quately punished by such punishment as the Court has power to impose, and the accused is not to be sent for trial to a British possession, the Court shall reserve the case to! be beard and determined by or under the direction of the Consul-General. ( 2 j The Court shall take the depositions,, and forthwith send them, with a minute of other evidence, if any, and a report on the case, to the Consul-General. (3 ) The Consul-General shall direct in/ wbat mode and where, consistently with tho- provisions of this Order, the case shall be- beard and determined, and the same shall be- so heard and determined accordingly. Summary Procedure. 41. Where the complaint discloses an offence which is not required to be heard on a charge, and the Court does not think fit in direct it to be heard on a charge, the accused may be tried summarily on the complaint: provided that no greater punishment shall be imposed than imprisonment with or without hard labour for three months, or a fine of £20, or both. Preliminary Examination. 42.—(1.) Where the accused is before thm Court, and it appears to the Court that the complaint discloses an offence— {a.) Which ought to be tried in or re ported to another Court; or {b.) Which ought to be tried before the same Court with Assessors ; the Court shall forthwith so inform the ac cused, and proceed to make a preliminary examination in the prescribed manner. (2.) If after such preliminary examination- the accused is ordered to be tried, the Court shall bind by recognizance the prosecutor and every witness to appear at the trial to prose cute, or to prosecute and give evidence, or to- give evidence (as the case may be). 43.—(1.) If a British subject, having ap peared as prosecutor or witness at a pre liminary examination, refuses to enter into a recognizance to appear at the trial to prose cute or give evidence, the Court may send him to prison, there to remain until after the trial, unless in the meantime he enters into a recognizance. (2.) But if afterwards, from want of suf ficient evidence or other cause, the accused is discharged, the Court shall order that the person imprisoned for so refusing be also dis charged. (3.) Where the prosecutor or witness is not a British subject, the Court may require him either to enter into a recognizance or to give other security for his attendance at the trial,, and, if he fails to do so, may in its discretion dismiss the charge. 44.—(1.) The charge upon which an ac cused person is tried shall state the offencecharged, with such particulars as to the time and place of the alleged offence, and the per son (if any) against whom or the thing (if any) in respect of which it was committed, as are reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the matter with which he is charged. (2.) The fact that a charge is made is equivalent to a statement that every condition required by law to constitute the offence charged was fulfilled in the particular case. (3.) Where the nature of the case is such that the particulars above mentioned do not give such sufficient notice as aforesaid, the charge shall also contain such particulars of the manner in which the alleged offence was com mitted as will give such sufficient notice. (4.) For the purposes of the application of any Statute law, a charge framed under the provisions of this Order shall be deemed to be an indictment. 45. For every distinct offence of which any person is accused there shall be a separate charge, , and every such charge shall be tried separately, except in the cases following, that is to say : — (a.) Where a person is accused of more offences than one of the same kind com mitted within the space of twelve months from the first to the last of such offences, he may be charged with, and tried at one trial for, any number of them not exceeding three. (5.) If in one series of acts so connected together as to form the same transaction more offences than one are committed by the same person, he may be charged with, and tried at one trial for, every such offence. (c.) If the acts alleged constitute an offence falling within two or more defini tions or descriptions of offences in any law or laws, the accused may be charged with, and tried at one trial for, each of such offences. (d.) If several acts constitute several offences, and also when combined a different offence, the accused may be charged with, and tried at one trial for, the offence con stituted by such acts when combined, or one or more of the several offences, but in the latter case shall not be punished with more severe punishment than the Court which tries him could award for any one of those offences. , (e.) If a single act or series of acts is of such a hature that it is doubtful which of several offences the facts which can be proved will constitute, the accused may be charged with having committed all or any of such offences, and any number of such charges may be tried at once; or he may be charged in the alternative with having committed some one of the offences; and if it appears in evidence that he has committed a different offence for which he might have been charged, he may be convicted of that offence, although not charged with it. 46. When more persons .than one are ac cused of the same offence or of different offences committed in the same transaction, or when one is accused of committing an offence and another of abetting or attempting to com mit that offence, they may be charged and tried together or separately, as the Court thinks fit. 47. — (1.) Any Court, if sitting with As sessors, may alter any charge at any time be fore the opinions of the Assessors are ex pressed; if sitting without Assessor^, at any time before judgment is pronounced. (2.) Every such alteration shall be read and explained to the accused. (3.) If the altered charge is such that pro ceeding with the trial immediately is likely, in the opinion of the Court, to prejudice the accused or the prosecutor, the Court may ad journ the trial for such period as may be necessary. 48. —(1.) No error or omission in stating either the offence or the particulars shall be regarded at any stage of the case as material, unless the accused was misled by such error or omission. (2.) When the facts alleged in certain par ticulars are proved and constitute an offence, and the remaining particulars are not proved, the accused may be convicted of the offence constituted by the facts proved, although not charged with it. (3.) When a person is charged with an offence and the evidence proves either the com mission of a minor offence or an attempt to commit the offence charged, he may be con victed of the minor offence or of the attempt. 49. —(1.) If the accused has been previously convicted of any offence, and it is intended to prove such conviction for the purpose of affect ing the punishment which the Court is com petent to award, the fact, date, and place of the previous conviction shall be stated in the charge. (2.) If such statement is omitted, the Court may add it at any time before sentence is passed. (3.) The part of the charge stating the pre vious conviction shall not be read out in Court, nor shall the accused be asked whether he has been previously convicted, as alleged in the charge, unless and until he has either pleaded guilty to, or been convicted of the subsequent offence. (4.) If he pleads guilty to, or is convicted of, the subsequent offence, he shall then be asked whether he has been previously con victed as alleged in the charge. (5.) If he answers that he has been so pre viously convicted, the Court may proceed to pass sentence on him accordingly, but, if he denies that he has been so previously con victed, or refuses to, or does not, answer such question, the Court shall then inquire con cerning such previous conviction.

'7 % dear Takely, Your letter P 3948/25 of the 24th about people con- victed before the Mixed Court at Addis Ababa. I don’t think that formal official correspondence is a very good metnod of discussing a point of law, so I am writing to you to give my views on the point you raise; perhaps you would submit them to sir 3. Chamier,if, as I imagine, it is his opinion which is embodied in your letter, and, if .^6 w^uld like me to come across and discuss the point wit n±..i, I am entirely at his disposal. x confess triac I had some qualms about using the Foreign Jurisdiction Act in the case of persons convicted before That is, I suppose, really an Abyssinian tribunal, but iu certainly never occurred to me that the course pro posed was open to the objection taken in your letter that Section 8 'does not seem to authorise the making of an order for removal in custody to another country but only bo autnorise detention for the purposes of such an order The/ Jakely Esc., c.B., India o -o.* ui 11 ce.The Section says that ' removal or deportation and any deten- 'tion for the purposes thereof according to the provisions 'of the Order in Council shall be as lawful as if the order 'of the Court were to have- effect wholly within that country', and it seems to me that the interpretation put upon the Sec tion in your letter deprives the words underlined of any ef fect. Further, the Section in question is the one which is used in all our Orders in Council to authorise detention en route in cases of deportation (see e.g. the China Order in Council, 1904, Article 85(8) and Article 123), and it has never, so far as I know, been suggested that detention en route under provisions of this nature was not lawful: and, if the order made under that Section is effective for this par- pose in cases of deportation, I do not see why it should not be effective in cases of removal. If a provision under Sec tion 8 will cover the period up to the moment when the prisons^ is handed over to the authorities of the country he is being sent to, it would seem that the position would be secured, os after that moment the proposed local legislation authorising his detention in gaol would suffice. However, if you have any alternative suggestion to nmbe, we/we shall of course be only too glad to consider it. The Government of Lidia originally suggested (your letter P 2538/25 of August 14th) that the Consul-General should be empowered to make a declaration that it was desirable th t prisoners should serve their sentence outside Abyssinia and that the Government of Abyssinia should make legal pro- vision for the despatch of the prisoners in question to the place named in the declaration: I do not see what legal effect the first part of this suggestion could have, and tne second is out of the question, because we should not admit that the Abyssinian Government were in a position to provide for the legal custody of British subjects in Abyssinia, and nobody could suggest that they could do so outside that country. I very much hope we may be able to agree upon some means of dealing with the difficulty, because the recent developments in the case of the Somalis whom the Ras has just sentenced to death show that it is essential to pro vide some means by which persons convicted by the Mixed Court can serve their sentences outside Abyssinia; for, if the/the Ras discovers that we cannot provide for the imprisonment of such people, he will he all the more inclined either to sentence them to death or to claim to imprison them in an Abyssinian prison.No. 3589/1.

Dated 10 BEC 1925 Received ^ DEC 192 5 Sir, execution m the Men Special Prison of Muliammad Puri, a Somali, who has been convicted and sentenced to death by His ' es'oy’s Consul General in Abyssinia. I am directed by the Governor in Council to forward a copy of a letter No.10006, dated the 20th August 1925, irom the Inspector General of Prisons, Bombay Presidency, and of a warrant addressed to the Superintendent of the Aden Special Prison by His Majesty’s Consul General in Abyssinia in which he directs that the Superintendent should receive into his custody Muhammad Puri, who was convicted before him and sentenced to death for the offence of wilful murder under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, and that he should detain the convict until such time as His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State lor Foreign Affairs shall confirm the sentence or make any other such order as he may think fit. The Inspector General of Prisons considers that the detention of the convict in the Aden Special Prison is covered by section 15 (1) (a) of the Prisoners’ Act III of 1900, but is doubtful whether he can be executed there unless a special order is issued under section 18 of that Act. After careful consideration of the case in consultationconsultation with the Advocate General, the Goverment^of Bombay consider that section 15(1) (a) deals with all kinds of sentences. Part III of the Act deals with prisoners in bne Piesidency towns: Part IV in which section 15 occurs deals with prisoners outside the Presidency towns. In the opinion of the Government of Bombay the words “any sentence or order“ appearing in section 15 (1) (a) are unqualified and include sentences or orders for execution by hanging oi mapping, fne word B Warrant“ only is qualified by the ..oids m j.oi the detention of any person'. In section 15(2) tae v.ord Sentence' is not limited to a sentence of imprisonment. Ihe marginal notes, to which strictly reference cannot be made for construing a section, contain the words 'sentences of certain Courts' and not 'sentences ior bne detention of persons'. The Government of Bombay doubt whether the word 'detention' refers to a sentence of imprisonment only. o. In the opinion of the Government of Bombay the Phrase “acting under the general or special authority of Her Majesty' occurring in section 15 (1) (a) of one Act means acting in passing the sentence. The Consul General in Abyssinia is a 'Court acting without British India under the general ...... authority °i ner (His) Majesty'. Section 15 (1) (a) applies to any sentence passed by His Majesty's mxmt Consul General in Abyssinia and the Officer in charge of the Aden Special Prison is empowered by section 15 (1) to give efiect to a sentence of death passed in Abyssinia by the British Consul General's Court. The Officer in charge of the Prison could plead justification for executing the sentence of death under section 15. ^ There is another aspect of the case. This matter -squires consideration from the 2 x 1 point of view of the yiovisions contained in the Abyssinia Order in Council, -hich was published under the Foreign aid PoliticalBepartaent Notification No.180-G, dated the 17th February 1915, printed in the Gazette of India, Part I, pages 895- b80. iii oicj-6 58 of this Order 1*0Quires that a sentence of death awarded by His Majesty's Consul General shall be confirmed by the Secretary of State. Article 56 lays down chat an oireixiei convicued and sentenced to imprisonment in an Abyssinian Court may, if it appears to the Consul General expedient that the sentence should be carried into effect within His Majesty's dominions, be sent for imprisonment to Aden, Bombay or Malta. The question in the present case is whether the Somali convict Muhammad Puri could be executed at Aden or should be sent back to Abyssinia to be executed there. As stated in the foregoing paragraph the Officer in charge of the Men Special Prison has authority to execute the sentence of death if he has no reason to doubt the legality of a warrant or order sent to him for execution under Part IV of the Prisoners' Act III of 1900. In this case the question has been raised whether the Consul General has authority to send the prisoner for execution to Aden. It appears that the Abyssinia Order in Council does not authorise the British Consul General to send prisoners sentenced to death for execution to Aden. The Consul General has issued a warrant of commitment, which he is authorised to do under section 56 of the Abyssinia Order in Council. The Government of Bombay consider that before Muhammad Furi can be executed at Men an order or warrant must be sent to the Superinten dent of the Men Special Prison, in pursuance of the sentence of death, directing him to carry the sentence into execution. As the Order in Council does not make any provision for sending offenders convicted and sentenced to death in any Abyssinian Court to Men for execution, and as the warrant to the Superintendent of the Men Special Prison is a warrant of commitment, and as it seems that therevhe-re is no authority for the issue of a warrant for carrying the sentence of death into execution, the Government o± Bombay consider that Muhammad Puri should after the sentence of death is confirmed, be takenW to Abyssinia to be executed there. 1 bJn 00 1 bl5U£st that %he Government of India may be moved to pass such orders as they deem fit.

Sir, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Amery to acknowledge the receipt of your letter Ko. J 3121/681/1 of the 19th November enclosing the draft of proposed amendments to Articles 35 and 56 of the Abyssinia Order in Council 1913 on the subject of the place of detention of British Somalis convicted before the Mixed Court at Addis Ababa, and to request you to inform Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain that he concurs in the terms of article 1 of the proposed amending Order. 2. As regards article 2 it appears to Mr. Amery that this clause, even if read alone, would suggest that Berbera is a place 'within His Majesty^ Dominions' and when read, as it has to be, with article 56 of the Principal Order, it makes that suggestion a matter of necessary implication. * would seem, therefore, that article 56 itself requires slight amendment and that it would be preferable iX article 2 of the amending Order were to provide for the amendment of article 56 of the Abyssinia Order in Council 1913 by substituting the words'without the limits of this Order' for the words 'within His Majesty ! s Dominions' and, by adding Berbera to the places therein mentioned to which offenders may be sent for imprisonment as therein provided.

Th9 Coil a'ul-General may, by warrant under his hand and seal, cause the offender to be aent to Aden, Bombay, fclta or Berbers (as the case may require), in order that the sentence may be there carried into effect accordingly.

In reply I would point out that the case con templated in paragraph 3 of your despatch has already arisen in so far as concerns a Somali sentenced to death by me in the Consul-General’s Court, as reported in my despatch Ho. 97 or August 6th last* I sent the prisoner to Aden in compliance with article 56 (2) of the Abyssinia Order in Council, 1913* If the death sentence has unfortunately to be carried out, my presumption was, and is, that it should be carried out at Aden* I can see no .valid ground why a death sentence, passed either by the Court of His Majesty's Consul-General or by the Mixed Court, should not be carried out at Aden, so long as the Government of British Somaliland objects to it being done at Berbers. 3. As regards executions in Abyssinia, I understand that they are now carried out scientifically at Addis Ababa. I consider, however, that the execution of a British subject in an Abyssinian gaol would be most undesirable from every point of view. Our prestige would suffer very materially if we were to consent to such a. thing. Abyssinia is still very far from being a tie Kt. Hon. Austen Chamberlain, M.P., » &amp;c. , &amp;c.,a 'civilized' country. We have obtained the concession in this country that any foreign subject, when arrested, shall immediately be handed over to his own legation. There ne is deta ined until sent to the nearest colony or territory for execution of the sentence passed on him by either of the Courts above mentioned. It seems to me that we could scarcely yield this point alone. We have hitherto held to the Klobukowski Treaty until we have a treaty of our own. Until then we cannot possibly abandon the privileges in that Treaty. lor can we establish a precedent without first coming to an agreement with the other countries concerned. I asked my Italian colleague what his views were on the subject. He entirely agrees with me in seeing the strongest objections. He points out that the case might one day occur of a real Italian or an Englishman being condemned to death, and that we could not possibly allow them to be executed in Abyssinia. The G-overnment of Eritrea, for motives of economy, had suggested that Italian protected subjects might serve their sentences in Abyssinia. Count Colli had vetoed this. He could not keep them for long in the compound, and could not possibly consent to their being confined in an Abyssinian gaol, much less to their being executed in this country.

They seem to rely upon sso 8 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act 1890. But that section does not authorise an order for removal or deportation. It only authorises detention for the purposes of such an order. One must therefore look elsewhere for the power to authorise a British Court to order removal or deportation. We may assume that a British Court may be authorised to order removal or deportation in the sense of expulsion from the limits within which the Order in Council has affect i.e.the kingdom of Abyssinia. But is it possible by Order in Council to empower a British Court in Abyssinia to remove or deport a man in uha sense oc sending him in custody to another country ani oQc3*.:\a handing him over in custody to the authorities of that country ? Section 7 of the Act of l§§6 n r©inov!l in. this sense in certain cases ana there are other statutes which authorise such removal, but neither sec 7 of the Act of 1890 nor the statutes to which I refer apply bo the present case. It seems to me that the Foreign Office are trying to treat sec 8 of the Act of 1890 coupled with an order under Art 3o as if they were equivalent bo sec 7 of the Act. unless there is some statute- or some power inherent in the Crown of which I am not aware a British Court in Abyssinia cannot (except where sec 7 of the Act of 1890 applies) be empowered by Order in Council to order a man bo be taken in custody to Aden and there handed over in custody to the officer in charge of the jail. The amendment of the Indian Prisoners Act 1900 would by itself be of no use as, if I am right, the men sent to Aden under Art -35 would be entitled to go ashore there as free men. I should reply bo tbs B'breign Office that it is not clear to us that their proposed amendment of Art 35 will get- over the legal difficulty about the custody of the men on the way to the jail at Aden, that see 8 of the Act of 1890 does not seem to authorise the making of an order for removal in custody to another country hup only to authorise detention for the purposes of such an order and we are not aware what authority there is^outside cases coveredby 300 7 of the Aot of 1890 and oertain other statutory provisions which are not applicable here / for empowering a British Court in Abyssinia to order a man to be taken in custody to another country and there handed over in custody to the authorities of that country, that the power to deport may be assumed but deportation does not seem to be sufficient for the present purpose. Unless the right to bake the men in custody to the jail is clear it would appear that the amendment of the Indian Prisoners Act would be of no use. The foreign Office may be able to remove my doubts. If their proposalaasaa is accepted it is unlikely that men of the class concerned will challenge the validity of action taken but it is our business to see that all is in order. We had the same kind of difficulty in the case of a Ur Borniman who was deported from Bombay during the war. We wanted to make him come bo England bub we had no power to bring him here under arrest so we put him on board a ship at Bombay and arranged with the authorities at the different ports of call to prevent him from landing !*• - 'iPX'Sl ?s' ‘ ' In'aiiy further communication on this subject, please quote no.

The Under Secretary of State, India Office.(J 3121/681/1) 45809/25 ~~~Uq1 pni al Office, Dooming Street, 22 nd October, 1925, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Amery to acknowledge the receipt of your letter (ho J 2645/68l/i) of 10th October, on the subject of the place of imprisonment of British Somalis convicted in Abyssinia, 2, Mr. Amery has referred the correspondence prior to your letter to the Acting Governor of Somaliland for his information, but he would prefer not to instruct him to legislate so as to legalise the detention in Somaliland of prisoners sentenced by the Abyssinian Mixed Court and removed to Somaliland, until a decision is taken upon the connected question of the place of execution of British Somaliland natives convicted in Abyssinia, he notes that pending a reply from His Majesty's Minister at Adis Abeba on the las’D point, Mr. Chamberlain would wish to arrive at an agreement upon the arrangements to be made for ensuring that only natives of British Somaliland are brought within the scope of the arrangements xor removing prisoners to Berbera, and suggests tnat for this purpose the system of registration prescribed oy Article 133 of the Order-in-Council should be utilised.

Sir: - With reference to my despatch No. 192 of the 1st ultimo regarding sentences passed in Abyssinia on British Somalis, I transmit to you, herewith, a copy of a farther letter on this subject from the Colonial Office. 2. You will see that the Colonial Office do not propose to refer to the Acting-Oovernor of Somaliland ] the questions raised in my t despatch No. 181 of the 26th August, relating to the imprisonment of Somalis, until they are in possession of this department’s ob servations on the connected matter of the place of execution for Somalis condemned to death by courts in Abyssinia. 3. In the meanwhile, they are anxious that there shall be no misunderstanding as to yyho are recognised by the Government of the protectorate as natives o± bomaxiland. You will appreciate that the Protectoraue cannot be expected to accept responsibility for all those persons loosely termed TT Somalis fT who are widely distributed through out North-Bast Africa. In dealing with questions relating to Somalis, it is necessary to act with circumspection, and in cases where there is the slightest doubt youyou should refer at the earliest possible stage to Berbers for confirmation of the j British Somali status of any given individual especially if he has not registered with the nearest consulate. If the person in question is not recognised as a native of the Protectorate, he must not be regarded as a British subject or protected person unless he can prove his connection with some other Colonial administration -a connection which must be recognised as valid by that administ ration. 4. I recognise that owing to the backward character of Somalis in general, it will be extremely difficult to ascertain with any degree of certainty who are entitled to British protection. The process might per haps be simplified by utilising the machinery of registration of British residents in Abyssinia prescribed by article 138 of the Order in Council. If lists giving the necessary particulars of persons registering themselves were sent quarterly for confirma tion to the Dominion, Colony or Protectorate of which they claimed to be natives. His Majesty’s representatives in Abyssinia would know from the outset which persons were actually to be treated as British subjects or protected persons. Such lists would of necessity not be exhaustive in that, despite the penalties prescribed by the Order in Council,Co nr c IX, no X nlX BniXigh. lsiiIdtogXs End pro— toctod persons onn or do in fact register themselves, hut the system contemplated would at least tend to minimize the possibility of misunderstandings between the departments and administrations con cerned regarding financial liability. 5. The India Office and Colonial Office agree as to the desirability of making some such arrangement 'and I shall there fore be glad to learn whether you consider the procedure suggested to be practicable. In this event you should issue appropriate instructions to the consulars officers under your supervision.? &gt;? v il \ ; • on tins suojwu, ^ no.

The Colonial Office have pointed out that many persons throughout North Africa claim to be Somalis though they might not necessarily be recognised as such by the Somaliland Protectorate. In order to avoid difficulties arising over the question of pecuniary liability, Mr. Chamberlain is considering the possibility of instructing His Majesty’s Minister at Addis Ababa to arrange for lists, giving particulars of persons registering themselves under article 138 of the Abyssinia Order in Council, to be sent quarterly for endorsement to the Dominion, Colony or Protectorate of which they c 1 airn to be natives. Such lists would of necessity not be exhaustive, in that, despite the penalties provided by the Order in Council, not all British subjects register themselves, but the system contemplated would at least tend to minimize tnei n r 4' ^ 1 Q A O H v. 1 w w L. possibility of misunderstandings on the part of the departments and administrations concerned regarding financial liability. In cases of doubt, especially as far as unregistered persons are in question, the Minister would have to refer for a ruling to the Colonial administration concerned. In this way it will be possible to ascertain which persons in Abyssinia are actually entitled to British protection. 5. If the proceeding suggested above should prove practicable, I am to enquire whether the Earl of Birkenhead would be prepared to send appropriate instructions to the Government oi India ior the reception, checking and return of the lists.

Mr.Chamberlain will therefore be grateful if section 15 of the Prisoners Act for Aden can be amended so as to allow of the detention there of British subjects convicted by the Abyssinian Mixed Court. 3, As regards the cost of detention I am to suggest that the Indian Government should be called upon to bear that of British Indian prisoners in view of the fact that The the proposal that they should serve their sentence at Aden is based on humanitarian grounds and is designed to save them from having to undergo incarceration in an Abyssinian prison. 4.

Counsel for the Defence agreed to raise no objection. The irregularities in the Consular trial were very severely criticised by the assessors and I almost decided to quash the case. As, however, we were all satisfied that Abdul Kanni had indeed been guilty of an illegal act, and as he could not in all fairness plead ingorance of the law after after the warning given him by His Majesty’s Consul. I decided that it would be tantamount to a miscarriage of justice to let him off altogetner. In view, The Rt.Hon, Austen Chamberlain,M.P. etc. etc. etcview, therefore, of the extenuating circumstances mentioned in the judgment, and of the fact that Abdul Kanni was,the father of a family and not a rick man, I decided,-whilst confirming the conviction, to reduce the sentence and gave judgment accordingly on the ,16th instant. Out of the court, I caused a serious warning to be conveyed to Abdul Kanni that a much heavier sentence would be imposed if he were again found guilty of the same offence. I think the judgment will serve me a warning to other British subjects. Indeed, only to-day an Indian who ha.d just heard about the case came to ask what he ought to do. H e had sold certain rifles and cartridges in his possession to the Government, but had more to dispose of. ihe Government did not consider it necessary to give him a licence, as it appears they do not enforce their own laws. I have promised to look into the matter., I am aware that the Somaliland Government take a very serious view of offences of the nature described above, but at the same time I cannot allow questions of expediency to influence the course of kustice. I.must admit, nevertheless, that, had the sale for instance been matones, it would have been difficult to enforce article 62 (c) oi the Abyssinia Ordep in Council with the same severity wnen the Abyssinian authorities themselves frequently do not know their own laws and wink at their infringement. .. n transmitting the judgment in the appeal to His ajesiy’s Consul at Harrar I am drawing his very serious attention to the irregularities in the trial which have made such a bad impression in the appeal. I have etc. (3d.) C .31. 3EITTINCK.&amp; P.?465/I925 » Copy, Case Np .. 7 of l , sU-^Kanril I.^ohainad. Baksh . Abdul Kanui, a native of Peshawur in British India is charged with dealing in ammunition in Harar, an offence forbidden by Abyssinian law and therefore coming; within the limits of 62 (e) of the Abussinia Order in Council, 1913. Clown witness No..l deposes that, 5 or 6 months ago, he and witness No .2 went with Ao Ahmed, an Abyssinian Gala not present in Court, to accused's house where Ao Ahmed bought 08. worth of cartridges. Witness No.2 corroborates this in part, but says he did not see accused himself, but only his wife or daughter. Witness No.l further deposes that about the 1st May he took 12 empty cartridge cases to accused who agreed to refill them for him for 012 . Witness No .5 deposes that on the 1st May he went to accused's house and there purchased from him personally five cartridges for 01 . These cartridges are produced in Court, and show obvious signs of being old cases refilled and recharged. The evidence of witnesses Nos.3,4 and 6 does not support the three definite offences charged, but only goes to show that accused was in the habit of dealing in cartridges. Accused pleads not guilty to the charges, and denies absolutely having ever made or sold a cartridge. He wished to bring as witness his next door neighbour whose name he did not know, but who would say that he had never seen accused making or selling cartridges. I asked the two assessors whether they had heard enough to enable them to form their conclusions, and if so whether they might change their minds if this witness were produced and if he/%h© gave evidence as suggested by the accused. The assessors said that they had made up their minds, and that such evidence as was proposed would not make them change. They considered'the prosecution’s evidence trustworthy, and were of opinion that accused was guilty. I agree with the assessors, and have no doubt whatsoever but that accused has been clearly proved guilty of the offences charged. The discrepancy in the evidence given by 1st and 2nd witnesses is not, in my opinion, vital, as accused, even if he were not present at the sale, is in charge of his establishment, and must be held respons ible for the acts of his subordinates. Accused brings no evidence to show that the sale took place without his orders, he merely denies the whole series of transactions charged. It is a matter of com non knowledge that a considerable trade is carried on in Harar and the neighbourhood in refilling empty cartridge cases, which are then sold to abyssinians and Somalis, chiefly the latter. This trade is contrary to Abyssinia law, but no serious efforts are made by the local Government to put a stop to it. Offences of this nature are difficult to prove, but are extremely serious in their effects, as they direct ly encourage lawlessness and bloodshed among the naturally warlike Somalis on both sides of the Anglo-Ethopian frontier. Accused had been warned by me some months ago that I had heard reports of his alleged traffic in ammunition, but he took no notice, and. contined his work as before. Arrangements were accordingly made to institute proceedings against him. I find accused guilty under 62 (c) of the Abyssinia Order in Council, 1913, of selling or abetting the sale, or both, of cartridges on three separate occasi ais within the last/3 I hereby certify that the above is a true copy of the judgment given in Harar Criminal ''Case No .7 of 1925.

The Government of India consider that the amount (£77) paid by the Foreign Office as a compassionate grant to the relatives of the Abyssinian woman murdered by sowar Thakur Singh cannot be classed as a public claim against him, and cannot therefore be recovered from any pay that may be due to him. They further consider that there are no grounds upon which legal action could be taken to recover all or part of the amount from any bank balance that Thakur Singh may have.■ JA T , In any further communication on thi* subject, please quote , , N- T-itfiUUt h and address, j ( not to any person by name, but to— « q'he Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.VV. 1. 2 S’ TH E Under - Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to and begs to enquire, by direction of the Secretary of State, whether an answer may shortly he expected to the Foreign Office letter No. ‘7’■ ^ *J 0 (e-^ 0&gt; ft / 0 f |h e respecting 4 Foreign Office, C. / 2/^Minute Paper.

That however is the affair cf the Foreign Office. We have to consider the position in Aden. The risk that the prisoners will apply to the High Court at Bombay for an order in the nature cf a writ of Habeas Corpus is probably small. But I assumethat the Indian Prisoners Act 1900 is in force in Aden and if sc it is quite clear that the Superintendent of the Prison there has no rower to receive into custody prisoners sentenced by the Mixed Court at Addis Ababa. It would be the business of the Superintendent to refer the matter bo the Local Gcvern- ment. We should either have to 'square' the authorities or order them to commit an illegality. I am not in a position to say whether tne Indian Legislature would amend the law in the direction suggested by the Foreign Office. Moreover if my doubt as to Article 35 of the Order i n Council is well founded, in would appear uhai' something more would be required than a mere amendment of the Indian Act. to . 6 7290b 3000 5 / 24 , [6875] If, :,%In any further communication this subject, please quote J 1604/681/1. and address— not to any person by name, but to— “ The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.l. 1 O O * w t i URGMT. Foreign Office. S.W.l. 17th June, 1925. Sir, I am directed 'by Mr.Secretary Chamberlain to refer to the correspondence on the subject of the serving of sentences imposed by the Consular Court a.nd by the Mixed Court at Addis Ababa, which ended with the letter from your department No.P 1105/15 of 31st March,1915. 2, His Majesty’s Minister at Addis Ababa, has reported that some British Somalis have recently been arrested on a charge of murdering five Abyssinians in the province of Harrar. As will be seen from the enclosed memorandum, the ca.se is one which has to be tried in the so called Mixed Court, and not in the Consular Court, and it has accordingly been arramged that the preliminary examina.tion oi the case shall take place in the Mixed Court at Addis Ababa, ana the final sentence be pronounced by the Regent after consulta,tion with Mr.Bentinch. If the prisoner or prisoners are convicted, Mr.Bent inch has suggested that they should be sent to ^den to serve their term of imprisonment, in accordance with Article 56 of the Abyssinia Order-in-Council 1913; it is assumed from Mr. Bent inch ’ s telegrams that there is no question of the capital penalty being inflicted. 3. Under Article 35 of the Abyssinia Order-in-Council, “Where any person has been sentenced to imprisonment by any “Abyssinian tribunal, the Court may, either by separate “warrant or by endorsement on the warrant of the Abyssinian The Under-Secretary of State, India Office.% tm’’Court cause such, pi is oner to be detained in custody either 'pending his trial or while he is serving his sentence, as 'the case may be', Mr*Chamberlain is advised that this would enable a sentence imposed in the manner proposed in the present case to be served in any prison in Abyssinia in which British subjects convicted by the Consular Court serve their sentences but it is less clear that it would enable a sentence to be carried out in a prison in British territory. It is possible to argue that the words 'any Court' in Article 56 of the Abyssinia Order include a,n Abyssinian Court, such as the Mixed Court, which has jurisdiction over British subjects, in view of the definition of 'the Court' in Article 5, which contains the words 'subject, 'however, to the provisions of this Order with respect to 'powers and local jurisdictions', and if so, the accused persons could be sent to Aden as proposed by Mr. Bent inch. But the difficulty is that Article 56 is expressly based on the power given by section 7 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, which only refers to offenders convicted be!ore 'a British 'court in a foreign country’,’ a,n expression defined in section 16 of the Act as meaning 'any British Court having 'jurisdiction out of His Majesty’s Dominions in pursuance 'of an Order-in-Council'; this definition clearly cannot cover the Mixed Court. 4. From investigations made in this department it does not appear that the point has previously a.risen sii.ce the passing of the Order, It is on general and humanitarian grounds undesirable to allow these Somali prisoners or any otherother British subjects to be confined in an Abyssinian prison, and if arrangements to this end can be made, it would be most convenient for the accused to serve their sentences at Aden. Mr.Chamberlain hopes therefore that Lord Birkenhead will be prepared to agree to this course being adopted, despite such risk as may exist that the prisoners should apply for a habeas corpus, or whatever is the corresponding procedure under the local law, on the ground that they are not in legal custody at Aden. If this risk is considered a serious one,I am to suggest that the matter might be put right by local legislation, supplement-' ing Article 35 of the Abyssinia Order, under v/hich imprisonment at Aden of persons sent there under that article would be authorised. Mr.Chamberlain is advised that that article would be sufficient to enable the prisoners to be regarded as in lega.l custody while on their way to Aden. 5. If the Secretary of State for India sees no objection to the adoption of this proposal I am to suggest that it would be found convenient if the proposed legislation could also extend to imprisonment a.t Bombay, in case it might be desired in future to send British subjects convicted before the Mixed Court to serve their sentences there. 6. In view of the fact that the prisoners will come up for triad, almost immediately, Mr .Chamberlain will be glad to receive an ea,rly expression of Lord Birkenhead ? s views on the question. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,%,f recherche et 1’arrestation dee coupabiee, ^ ”charge par elie d»en informer immediatement '1® consu - L de • Franc e et de les remettre entre ’’see mains 1 *. -c. uniie we have, under our treaty of 1897, no right oi most-favoured-nation treatment, except in regard to import duties, and although we have never formally adhered to the Franco-Abyssinian treaty as regards jurisdiction, we have, however, always claimed for our subjects the benefits of the French treaty by usage and custom, and in all cases where a British subject has been brought before an Abyssinian court his Majesty*s Legation has been represented. 3. Our rights under the French treaty were iiisisted upon in July, 1912 when, in consequence of a dispute in regard to the handing over, under the last paragraph of article 7, of an Italian who had murdered an Abyssinian, a memorandum was sent to the Abyssinian government on behalf of the British, French, German, Italian, Russian and United States representatives at Addis Ababa, setting forth the claims of those countries under that article. 4. In April, 1922 a draft treaty respecting British jurisdiction in Abyssinia was forwarded to His Majesty’s Minister at Addis Ababa,' article 3 of the draft stipulating that:- 'Legal proceedings in Ethiopia between 'British subjects or British protected persons 'and Ethiopian subjects shall be subject to 'the jurisdiction of a special court in which 'an%an A ’ tySBlrilan Judge shall preside and His Britannic 'Majesty's consul or his representative shall he 'assessor to the judge for purposes of advice and 'consultation. In all actions before this court 'if the defendant he an Abyssinian subject the case 'shall be decided according to Abyssinian law and if 'the defendant be a British subject it shall be 'decided according to English law, provided that 'where there is a dispute concerning the property or 'esta-ce of a British subject, excepting disputes M arising out of the holding of real property in 'Ethiopia, any legal proceedings arising out of such 'dispute shall he conducted in accordance with English law and the case decided in accordance with English law. Should one of the two parties he dis satisfied with the judgment of the court the case 'shall he referred to the Emperor of Ethiopia, who 'shall hear the appeal in consultation with and in 'the presence of His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, 'and his judgment shall he final.' 5. Thus, although the Abyssinian government did nou assent to this draft treaty, and no further progress was made in the matter, the principle that 'mixed' cases should he tried in a special court has repeatedly been admitted by us. 6. It will he seen from Has Taffari’s letter to M. Coppet (French Minister) in A 5028/5028/l/l922 , that the special or 'mixed' court established by the Ahyssiniar in 1922 was set up in conformity with the Franco-Ahyssinis treaty of 1908, which continued to he applicable to the other legations.

Martin and Mr. Mody were present as Court interpreters. Phe accused, Ihakur Singh, a sowar of the 12th Cavalry I.A. was charged that he, on the morning of the 18th day of June 1924 at Addis Ababa, did commit murder, causing the death of a woman someti les known as Mulunash, and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, and within the cognisance of the Court of His Majesty^ Consul-General in Abyssinia. Accused pleaded not guilty. Mr. Thomas . Secretary to His Majesty*s Minister, sworn, states: On June 18th at about 3 a.m. hafadar halip Singh called, and reported that PhaAur Singh had killed a woman, I first understood him to say that an Abyssinian had killed an India. I went to the back door of the legation, where(Wyl I rnet; defendant, Indar Singh and, i thought at the time, the rest of the Escort. The defendant immediately said ”1 have shot a WOmanl ’- I Proceeded at once to the Escort quarters, to the defendants room, where a woman of about 18 or 19 years of age was lying on the floor apparently dead. I examined her as well as possible and came to the conclusion that she was dead. i put defendant under arrest, left the quarters, and went back to my room. on leaving the Escort quarters I looked at my watch and saw that it was 3.^0 a.m. I then went to bed, but an hour later it occured to me that, as the woman was lying in a twisted up position, it would save trouble later if I had the body straightened out before it stiffened. I went back and did this, and noted down the nature and position of the wound. Then I returned to my room. Shortly before 7 a.m. I sent a note to Dr. Henault asking him to come and examine the deceased. I then dressed and reported the matter to Mr. Bullock. At about 8 or 8.30 a.m. we went to examine the body (Mr. Bullock, Dr. Eenault and myself). Dr. Henault then wrote a certificate. The Kantiba was informed and requested to make arrangements to remove the body. At about 1 p.m. A to Mikael Eassa with some police arrived and asked if he could make investigations. I took him to see the Escort quarters and showed him the body; he took down such particulars as I v/as able to give, and attempted to ask some questions of the defendant which I disallowed. He then left. Eater in the day the body was removed, presumably by the relatives of the deceased. Between the time of the giving of the certificate and the appearance of Ato Mikael the defendant idefendant made a statement. (The witness ?/as not sure about the time of this statement).

Counsel...: said that the defence in this case is briefly unsoundness of mind of such a nature as to give the accused the benefit of Section 84 of the Indian Penal Code. Ihe death 01 the woman Mulunaish occurred on the morning of June 18th last. On the morning of the next day June 19th the accused was to have left Addis Ababa to return to his home in India having concluoeo a period of 3 years escort duty at the British .Legation, and in fact his comrades did so leave. The accused was happily circumstanced in India, having relations of whom he was both fond and proud. His father and grand-father served with honour in the Govern ment service and his brother is still serving. After long absence in a foreign country the accused was looking forward with intense longing to his return to his kinsfolk and motherland. How at last the orders had come, the relieving escort so eagerly awaited had arrived, and he and his comrades were on the eve of setting forth on the homeward journey. With this happy prospect opening at his feet, he kills a woman. .as far as the evidence given by the witnesses of the prosecution goes there was no motive for this act, save that put forward voluntarily by the accused himself, and the act was committed under circumstances which render ed detection inevitable, and in fact the accused made no effort to escape and himself went and woke his dafadar to report what he had done. And what was the motive put forward by the accused? 'The woman bewitched me'. 'She put charms in my bed which made me mad for love. It came upon me suddenly that I must kill her'. The killing was not premeditated. He did not....be• not call the woman to come She came that night of her OY/n initiative. The pair made merry together over a bottle o± wine. They slept together. Then came the awakening of the accused. The mad thought, put into his mind by the previous discovery of some papers in his bed and the inter pretation put upon them by an Abyssinian confidant, returns. ’’She has bewitched me. She must die”. ”1 felt a sort of sensation in me” he told the Consul, or, as he put it to the Consul, ’’Something happened in my brain”. He kills the woman and goes quietly to his superior officers and tells them he has killed a Y/oman because she had bewitched him. Auite evidently he believes he has justification - he believes he has done something which was right and not wrong. Were the processes of this man's mind rational? Assuredly not. The evidence, as far as it goes, is clear that he entertained delusions, that he suffered from a failure of reasoning power, in fact that at the time his mind was unsound and that this unsoundness of his mind prevented him from knowing the real nature of his act and from distinguishing right from wrong. Counsel sub mitted therefore that under Section 84 of the Indian Penal Code accused should go free. There was another aspect of this matter which should not be lost sight of. It might be said that when a defence of unsoundness of mind was entered, the burden of proof rests with the accused and this Counsel did not dispute, but the interests of the accused were not properly cared for, and it was morally speaking the duty of someone in authority to see that the ignorance and inexperience oi the accused did not act disadvantageously to him. It was clear from the start that the plea entered for him wouldbe unsoundriess of mind. why was no medical examination of the state of accused's mind made at once? why were his comrades allowed to depart without examination? Surely they if anyone cou,.d have given valuable testimony that he was known to be suffering from delusions and to have oeen in a queer state mentally. Their evidence should have been taken immediately. it was not. flow more than 7 months later it was obviously difficult to elicit facts and to elucidate matters which were not enquired into at the time. And why this delay? Because the affair had become the subject of a diplomatic tussle between the British and Abyssinian governments. There is something repugnant to the English sense of justice and fair-play that the agony of the accused should have been prolonged, and that his interests should have become the plaything of political factions. There have been many irregularities in this case - the accused kept in custody for seven months without any warrant being issued and without any charge being framed against him and without any proper investigation being made into the facts. The circumstances under which his confession was received - by a very young official who does not appear to have been either competent or properly authorised to receive it and without any warning being given to the accused that it would be used in evidence against him - were to say the least of it, peculiar. As a fact however, the frank confession of the accused, made of his own free will, without the warning of the officer who received it perhaps tending to make him less frank, is as favourable as any evidence available to his plea, for it shows clearly the queer irrational mind ofthe accuse( i at the time« That the Consul, Mr. Bullock, too was impressed by this at the time the confession was made is clear, for he stated ^Tke fact that he believed she used withcraft against him seems in his mind to be a justification for his action”. Counsel submitted that the evidence given and the facts as established showed the accused to have been in an unsound sta go of mind at the time the woman was killed by him, and asked the Court to find in that sense and to declare that therefore no offence was committed by the accused, and to let him go free. The Consul-General , summing up, said that he would ask the assessors to assist him in coming to a conclusion. He presumed they would have little doubt as to what had occurred. They would probably have accepted the accused’s statement as substantially true. That being so, there was no doubt that he had intentionally caused the death of the woman whose body was found in his room. healing with the defence, the Consul-General said that it was maintained that accused was insane. But he (Consul-General) could see little evidence of true in sanity. The accused was very possibly mad in the sense that he was mad about this unfortunate woman, but not madder, probably, than many men they (the assessors) had know under the influence of love which was known to produce all manner of aberrations. The accused was very possibfy honest in his belief that magic had been used on him, and that he was bewitched, but one could not consider belief in witchcraft a proof of insanity - especially not in a man of Asiatic race. It was not so long since our own law ceased to believe in witchcraft. Accused’s conduct after the commission of the deed had been that of an honest man but hardly that of an insane man. It.. . ..It was much to be regretted that the evidence of the accusers fellow-so Idlers had not been taken before they left for India. Their testimony would have been desirable, not only on the point of the accused T s mentality, but for other reasons. The defence complained that the accused was not examined by a doctor; no doubt that should have been done, but it should be remembered that the opinion of any available doctor on such a subtle point as the accused’s sanity would not be worth much. healing with the irregularities alleged by the defence, he (the Consul- General) must say that the case seemed to him to have been casually, even negligently, treated at the beginning, but he could not hold that there had been any irregularity such as would vitiate the present proceedings. If the accused were not to be held insane, there remained the question of his guilt in respect of the charge against him. The accused was charged with murder. That was to say, culpable homicide amounting to murder. The Indian criminal law recognised also culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The Consul-General proceeded to explain the distinction between them as laid down. regards premeditation, he could see no evidence of it in the accused’s acts. Had he planned to kill the deceased, he would not have chosen his quarters for the crime, and it was in evidence that his rifle was habitually kept in his room. He had probably acted on a sudden impulse, and without discernment, but that was not sufficient to allow one to hold that his offence ?/as necessarily less than murder. One ground which could differentiate murder from culpable homicide was provocation. The assessors would consider how far this man might have been provoked by the deceased woman. Provocation...%Provocation, as defined by the law, must be 'grave and sudden He (the oonsul-tTeneral) dia not think that by 'sudden', the law meant that the provocation must be immediately antecedent to its consequences. A man might brood on provocation, and give way to it after making an effort to control himself, The nature of the provocation, if any, was a question of fact on which he would De glad to have the assessors 1 opinion li«as it sufficient to deprive the accused of his power of self control? In determining that question it was admissible to take into account the condition of mind in which the offen der was when provocation was given. This could only be a matter of conjecture. He himself says that he 'felt a sort of sensation in him' which impelled him to the deed. The accused^ belief that he had been bewitched, even if genuine, could be no excuse for his action, but it was evidence of his state of mind which could be taken into consideration. Again the accused 1 s conduct after the deed should be noted. It could not be regarded as the conduct of a deliberate or conscious criminal. It was a matterfer consideration v/hether, in view of all the facts and presumptions, the accused 1 s offence should be regarded as falling short of that with which he was charged. After deliberation, the Court found the accused guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, that is an offence punishable under section 304 of the Indian penal Code. The Court sentenced the accused to rigorous imprisonment for six years. The assessors concurred in the verdict and sentence.Annex 1 STATEIf^ITT QJ THAKUR SINm . Ab^au - ye3-^ 3,go I saw the woman in the Abyssinian court; then I arranged with Waha Wally, cow-boy at the Legation, to geu oiie woman, ana after about two months he brought her to my quarters, for which I paid him two dollars. I arranged witn the woman to come to my quarters once a week, and agreed to pay her eight dollars a month, she agreed, and in return I gave her whatever she asked, in kind and in money, por about a month she fulfilled the conditions, and subsequently began to give me trouble and worry. i fell in love, but she showed none in return, she visited me once in twenty days, once a month, and so on. I used to send word to her by Waha, Wally who left the service of the Legation on June 1st 1924. I only met him once after he left the service. I think Waha Wally has caused mischief in connection with this affair. About five days before the incident I discovered in my bedding the papers. I gave these papers to Gabre Mikael, the servant of Dafadar La lip Singh, and asked him to have them inspected, which he did, and brought me information that they were charms which made me fall in love without control. For two days these papers were with the boy, and during this time I felt no inclination towards the woman; on return of these papers I felt again inclined towards the woman, and on Tuesday night she came herself to my quarters. I explained to her about these papers, but she denied all knowledge, whion I did not believe. She came about seven o’clock, I gave her half a bottle of champagne, I drank half oi the bottle. I slept with her, and on waking about 3 a.m. I xelt a sort of sensation in me, and taking the rifle, I loaded ic with four cartridges, and fired one round at her, 'aiming e.t bhe left temple; after this I went and reported the matter to Dafadar Dalip Singh, and before he came I tried to unload the..... {&amp; the rifle, ana one of the rounds went off. I then gave the rifle to Dafadar Dalip Singh. ?/h en I shot the woman I think she was half drowsy, and was lying on the cot. After she was dead, I threw her on the ground, she was dead instantaneously. fj True copy, (signed) li.E. Taylor.Annex 3. British Legation, Addis Ababa. June 24th 1924.

At about 3 o’clock on the morning of Wednesday, June 18th 1924, A/L Lafadar Dalip Singh was called by Thakur Singh, the prisoner, coming to look for him, who said that he had just killed an Abyssinian woman in his room. / After seeing the corpse, the Lafadar and other sowars l accompanied the prisoner to the Legation and woke up Hr. Thomas, who proceeded to the scene of the crime, and after ascertaining that the woman was dead, gave orders for the prisoner to be put in chains. I was informed of the matter at about half past seven the same morning, and about eight o’clock with Hr. Thomas and Dr. Renaud, who is acting as Legation doctor, I went to the sowars’ quarters, where the doctor examined the body and gave a certificate of death. A .303 bullet has passed through the brain. In my presence the bullet was found in the wall, at a slightly lower level than where the head must have been; it had also passed through the wood-work of the bed. This confirms the prisoner’s statement that the woman was asleep in bed when he fired. The body was lying on the floor where the prisoner says he threw it. Both of them had been drinking during the night, but appar e ntly not to excess. It appears that nobody heard the fatal shot, but that immediately afterwards the prisoner went outside and in unloadinghis rifle accidentally fired it again. x he p-.i soner had known the woman for ah out a year, and s ne visited him oceasi onally. I am informed that she had several other lovers, and kept a drinking shop. The prisoner was in love with her, and the motive for the crime appears to be that she would not accompany him to India. The fact that he believed she used witchcraft against him seems in his mind to be a justification for his action. He was quite calm when I saw him, and hr. Thomas informs me that he was equally so during the night. He made no attempt to deny or conceal the crime. The victim’s body was removed by the Abyssinian Authorities during the day. The prisoner has been kept in chains in the sowar’s quarters. At his urgent request the written charms, belonging to the woman, are being sent to the Abyssinian Government in order that they may express an opinion on them. (signed) G.H. Bullock.

Article 34 provides that the person should be remanded in custody* if necessary* but not for more than seven days, while under article 3b the court is instructed to issue a warrant for the person to be detained in custody pending his trial before the proper tribunal. There is no evidence of this having been done and the accused man seems to have been kept in custody with a charge of murder hanging over his head for seven months before anything whatever was done* These omissions are hardly mitigated by the facts that it whs intended • ***•* l:md Husaell, Msq.,,«y MtlPd- V J intended to &amp;end the accused for trial to Aden and that a discussion arose with the Abyssinian Government on tne question of jurisdiction. This dispute should not have prevented the taking of the necessary steps for making a preliminary investigation and providing for the legal custody of the prisoner before his trial, whether in Abyssinia or at Aden. 5. It is possible that if tneae facts were made public the accused person might apply to the privy Council to have the whole of the proceedings quashed on the ground of irregularity, and I shall therefore oe glad If you will call Mr* Bullock 1 s attention to these irregularities and will take steps to ensure that the procedure prescribed by the Abyssinian order in council is properly followed in any future ease which may jn&amp;vome before the Consular Court* 4.

Sir, I ajn directed by Mr.Secretary Chamberlain to refer to the letter from this department ilo.E 6267/5283/1 of the 8 th August, 1924, regarding the murder of an Abyssinian woman by a sowar, lhakur Singh, of the Indian escort at His Majesty’s Legation at Addis Ababa. 2. The procedure for the trial of the murderer formed the subject of correspondence v/ith the Abyssinian Government, who claimed that the trial should be conducted by their authorities and in their country. As it was extremely undesirable on political grounds to allow a British subject to be tried by an Abyssinian court on a grave criminal charge, His Majesty’s Chargfe d’Affaires was instructed to press for the removaJ of the prisoner to Aden for trial there. In the end the Abyssinian Government tacitly withdrew their claim, and the man was tried in the Court of the Consul General at Addis Ababa, was found guilty of culpable homicide and sentenced to six years rigorous imprisonment, and has been removed to Bombay to serve his sentence. 3. The Abyssinian Government, however, did not waive their claim to jurisdiction without demanding the payment of blood money to the relatives of the murdered woman. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires had been autnorised, witu Treasury consent, to pay blood money up to a maximum of fifty pounds. His Majesty’s Minister at Adais Ababa ne.s ftie Under Secretary of State, India 0 ffic e.%A I r r. 551) (500. £77. £77. now reported that he informed the Abyssinian Government that the practice of paying blood money was unknown to Indian law, but that he had been authorised to make a compassionate grant to the relatives of the deceased. The amount actually paid by His Majesty’s Minister was five hundred dollars, which, at the current rate of exchange is approximately equivalent to seventy seven pounds. The convict is believed to have a balance at the Allahabad Bank in India from which he could refund the amount disbursed and His Majesty’s Minister suggests that it may be possible to recover the seventy seven pounds from this balance. 4. I am accordingly to request that, if the Earl of Birkenhead sees no objection, the Government of Bombay may be instructed to consider the possibility of obtaining a refund from the man, whether from his bank balance or by stoppages from his pay.

Mr.Thomas, after ascertaining that the woman was dead, gave orders for Xhakur Singh to be put under arrest. The motive appears to have been unrequited love, and the woman*a refusal to accompany him to India. He seems to have considered himself justified by the fact that he discovered some papers belonging to her, which he believed to be love charms. Th© woman heal visited him at night occasionally during the past year, which is contrary to regulations. But enquiry has tended to show that th© Du ffadar and other bo wars were not aware of the fact. Bext morning, anticipating objections by the Abyssinian 0 ovomm&lt;i 2 t to the accused’s removal, I telegraphed to you for instructions, and on receipt of your reply, informed th© Government that I intended to send th© murderer to Aden for trial* The Government stated that they must insist on his trial here.

With reference to your memorandum No. 359-G., dated the 5th April 1917, I am directed to forward herewith a copy of the letter from the Political --Aj% Resident at Aden No. 6263 - 426 , dated tte 17th October 1914, and of Bombay Government letter No. 5530, dated the 24th September 1914, to which it was a reply. 2 I am to say that later inquiry from the Political Resident shows that the Abyssinian cases are not sufficiently numerous to justify special legislation, hut that the Governor in Council recommends that Act II of 1861 should be amended by some such provision as the following:—“ The Pirst Assistant Resident shall exercise all the powers of an additional Sessions Judge as defined in the Code of Criminal Procedure in the Court of Session of the Resident in any case which the Resident is empowered to try.” The Pirst Assistant Resident now exercises the powers of a District Magistrate, but the next senior Assistant can be invested with these powers under Section 18 of Act II of 1861. No. 6263—426, dated Aden, the 17th October 1914. From—M ajor-G-eneeal Sir James A. Bell, K.C.V.O., Political Resident, Aden, To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department, Bombay. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 5530, dated the 24th ultimo, forwarding copies of Articles 37 and.56 of the Abyssinia Order in Council, 1913, and to state that there is no objection to arrange ments being made for the trial and imprisonment at Aden of persons to whom the Order applies. I would, however, sugget the desirability of the Resident being authorised to delegate to one of his Assistants the power to try such cases, or alternatively, if this course is not approved, the First Assistant Resident may be specially invested with powers to try them. 2. I see no objection to the proposal contained in paragraph 3 of your letter under reply. No. 5530, dated Bombay Castle, the 24)th September 1914. From—A. F. Kindersley, Esq., Under Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department, To—The Political Resident at Aden. lam directed to forward herewith copies of Articles 37 and 56 of the Abyssinia Order in Council, 1913, and to request that you will favour Govern ment with your opinion at an early date as to whether there is an objection io the necessary arrangements being made for the trial or imprisonment at Aden of persons to whom the Order applies. 2. Under Section 6 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890 (see Statutes relating to India, Volume II, page 786), the Court by which persons sent to a British possession under an Order in Council for trial are to be tried is the Supreme Court of that possession. In the case of Aden, that Court will presumably be the Court of Session held by the Resident, sitting as Sessions Judge under Section 20 of India Act II of 1864. 3.. In view of the proviso to Section 21 of that Act, which excepts from the jurisdiction of the Resident any offence committed by an European British subject and punishable with death under the Indian Penal Code, Government propose, subject to any suggestions which you may have to make, to recom mend to the Government of India that executive instructions he issued to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General in Abyssinia that European British subjects charged with such offences should not be sent to Aden for trial. 4. With reference to Article 53 of the Order, I am to invite a reference to Section 15 of the Prisoners’ Act (India), 1900, by which the detention in British Indian jails of prisoners under the sentence or order or warrant of any Court acting under the authority of His Majesty, whether within or with*! out British India, is legalised, 5. I am also to forward a copy of Article 120 (1) of the Order in Council, and to state that it has been decided that the cost of maintaining at Aden and Bombay prisoners and others of British Indian nationality to whom the Order applies will be borne by Indian revenues, while that of maintaining persons of other than British Indian nationality will be recovered front Imperial revenues, the term “ British Indian ” being held, in this connection, to include subjects of Indian Native States.1917: SIMLA GENERAL.

Where a foreign country is not subject to any government from whom Her Majesty the Queen might obtain jurisdiction in the manner recited by this Act, Her Majesty shall by 'virtue of this Act have jurisdiction over Her Majesty’s subjects for the time being resident in or resorting to that country, and that jurisdiction shall be jurisdiction of Her Majesty in a foreign country within the meaning of the other provisions of this Act. 3. Every act and thing done in pursuance of any jurisdiction of Her Majesty in a foreign country shall be as valid as if it had been done according to the local law then in force in that country. 4.

I am sending a draft for this amount, but there are # certain points in connection with detention at Aden of prisoners rro?n Abyssinia which do not app-ar to m to be free from doubt* ^ 2. The bee catches tmc^r reference, and ail relevant ^ correspondence diiring 1925 and 1926 which I have been able to trace deals with the detention at Aden of prisoners convicted by the Abyssinian Mixed Court , and it was specifically in connection with such convicts that the Government of India limited their liability, 'for maintenance to convicts of British Indian nationality. This would appear to imply, prime facie, that no such limitation was made as regards persons convicted by the Consular Court, especially in view of the fact that the Consular Court may in some respects, though perhaps not legally, be regarded ss an Indian Court. 5. Amain, the Somaliland Government agree to bear the expense of Somalis, convicted by th© Mixed court and sent to serve their sentence at Aden, but I can find no such agreement in the case of convictions by th© Consular Court. 4. In order to make clear th© points on which I feel that a definite decision Is necessary, I put them, in th® form of questions as follows?*. (a) he Right Honourable Sir Austen Chamberlain, A* G*, etc&lt; etc. etc-(a) Is the Government of India liable for the cost of maintenance of all prisoners without distinction of race convict-d by Eis Majesty’s Consular Courts in Abyssinia? (b) If not, is the cost recoverable from the Gov eminent of that part of the js^pire to which the prisoner belongs? ( c) In this event, is such cost to be recovered direct by His Majesty’s Consulates in Abyssinia from the Government concerned, or should it b® shown in the quarterly accounts to be recovered eventually In London? (d) In the case of a prisoner convicted by a Consular Court, and serving his sentence in the Consular Prison at Addis Ababa Is the oost of his maintenance recoverable from the Government concerned* 5* My personal opinion Is that when a parson is convicted by a Consul Court, th© cost of maintenance, regardless of race, should in the case of imprisonment in Addis Ababa be born© by the Imperial Government, and in th© case of imprisonment at Aden or elsewhere be borne by the Government of India or Soiaaliland* If this be not accepted, and the Government of India claim reimbursement for prisoners other than British Indians detained at Aden, it would seem only Just that the Government of India and Somaliland should be responsible for the cost of Indian and Somali prisoners respectively detained at Addis Ababa* Convictions by th© Abyssinian Mixed Court on the other hand are on a totally different plane, imprisonment either in the Consular prison or at Aden having merely the object of saving the convict from the horrors of an Abyssinian prison, and it Is therefor© perfectly just that the cost of maintenance should be according to the race of the convict, though hare again I consider that if the sentence Is served In the Consular prison the cost should still be recoverable from th© Government concerned* I have, etc*, {Signed) 0* T* Maclean</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100057582487.0x000001_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/447/2</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100057582487.0x000001</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/447/2</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 959/1914 Pt 2 'Abyssinia: Order in Council.
