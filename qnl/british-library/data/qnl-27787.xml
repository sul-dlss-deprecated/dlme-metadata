This proposal should have the effect of ensuring the Company's rights and at the same time saving them money, since if the agreements were finally taken up their payments to the Rulers would be at a higher rate than under the tens of an exploratory or option arrangement. There do not seem to be any disadvantages attached and the Political Resident's proposals are, one imagines, likely to be very acceptable to the Company.

After discovery of oil in ccrrinercial quantities, Rs*90,000 per arjaum or royalty of Rs^i. In addition, payments of 4 annas per ton of all substances produced. The reference to drilling in Schedule I is to the effect that drilling will begin within 9 years of signature and that if the Company have not done geological and field work with every diligence within this period, the agreement will be annulled.

No, 350? o-nd. goes on to say that the Ruler on November 26th signed an agreement between and himself (i.e. the Ruler) to suspension, %io Managing Directors' proposals for extensions in both cases were submitted to the Political Agent and the Political Resident respectively, Mr, Packer hopes to obtain the Political Resident's view on the latter's arrival in Bahrein in the first week of December and he promises to report progress. Meanwhile Mr, Packer understands unofficially that the Political Agent does not favour the Managing Directors Ajman (?) proposals. The Political Agent (or Resident, the text is not clear) has been informed of the Managing Directors' alternatives in both cases. The cable as received was corrupt in parts and if the sense is not clear perhaps you will let us know in order that if necessary a repetition of the doubtful passages may be obtained.

There is no necessity to call for a repetition as the meaning is clear enough for present purposes. The first portion, regarding an agreement betvreen H.M.G, and the Ruler, obviously refers to Qatar and presumably we shall hear from you in due course on this matter. The remainder of the telegram refers to instructions sent by^ us to Packer regarding our .Agreements with the Shaikh of Ajman and the Sultan of Oman and Dhofar, The Ajman Agreement, which gives us survey and exploration rights only, expires in March, 1944 and we instructed Packer to endeavour to obtain an extension of the existing Agreement for a period expiring five years after the conclusion of an iurmistice between Great Britain and Germany and Japan, whichever shall be the later, on the grounds that our operations have been interrupted reasons beyond our control. if, however, the Political Resident does not favour such an approach, we gave Packer instructions as to the terms which he was authorised to offer the Shaikh for 1 a 75 year Concession in exercise of our right under Article 3 of the existing Agreement, Either of these alternative settlements are acceptable to us but we considered that the first alternative might be preferred by the Political Resident who might not wish to have negotiations for an Oil Concession opened at the present time in the Persian Gulf area. As regards Oman and Dhofar, we are prepared to accept either an/ F.A.K. Harrison, Esc,, India Office, Whitehall, S,W,1,f iAkmx-SteMjJ an extension of the 'option' period or to take up the Concession in accordance with its terms. Here again, we feel that.the interruption of our operations by the war might be considered y the Sultan as adequate reason and justification for the extension of the ’option' period. I will keep you informed of any further developments which may be reported by Packer, Yours sincerely, (Sd.) H.H. Wheat ley. 4|A. rCONFIDENTIAL , GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. Department.

This according to the Sultan prevents his own subjects, who may be employees of the Company, from having direct access to the State Officials should they have any grievance a ainst the Company. I think there is something to be said for the Sultan’s contentions and his suggested alternative sentence ( which he informed me he obtained from the first Draft Political Oil Agreement copy of which was given to him in Bombay vide my express letter No.T/101 of 8th December 1937), would appear to overcome the difficulty and might perhaps be agreed to, if you see no objection. sd.

Z. 3179/38 of the 10th May and connected correspondence on the subject of the Muscat Oil Political Agreements'^ In accordance with the agreed arrangements^ two Agreements have been concluded with the Company, viz. a 'General” Agreement, tijr which the Sultan has agreed to take cognisance in an exchange of letters, and a 'Pre-emption' Agreement, which will not be shown to the Sultan at all. Ten copies of each Agreement are enclosed. The 'General' Agreement is in the form accepted by the Sultan. The next step is the exchange of notes with the Sultan in regard to the 'General' Agreement, and provided that you see no objection we should be glad if you would now cause a letter to be addressed to His Highness in the terms of the enclosed draft. Here again the draft is in the form agreed to by the Sultan during the London'talks. As the Sultan has recently shown a disposition to prepare his own replies to our communi cat i ons we have not attempted to draft his reply in the present case; if, hov/ever, you think that a suggested draft /draft reply should he laid before him we are content to leave its preparation to you. The next step after the exchange of notes with the Sultan will be to obtain the Company’s formal acceptance of the arrangements referred to in the correspondence, and for this purpose we should be glad to be furnished with copies of the actual letters exchanged. The final step will be a letter to the Sultan (to which no reply will be expected) confirming the Company’s acceptance of the arrangements and stating, with reference to his father's undertaking of 1923, that H.M.G. have no objection to the concessions granted by the Company. Copies of this letter (with its enclosures) are being sent to the Government of India and to the Political Agent at Muscat. afnoer'efy. P, QIBSOfciftk CONFIDENTIAL. .•£ - 'US?' y. I £729 i ~2 O :?

It has, I believe, been recognised that though tne Convention may be useful as a guide it nas no value as a binding instrument so far aa tne Persian Gulf is concerned, and this view must apply equally to Muscat's adherence to it, From a more practical point of view I need only repeat the opinion expressed in paragraph 8(a) of Sir Vil L if Trenchard Fowle's demi-official letter i!fo.204-S dated the J 3 Sr ■ — 17th larch 1938 on tne subject of' the Muscat Arms Traffic subsidy, — tnat tnere is no real danger of renewal of gun running from Muscat. o X Si Sir In r «ga r d to your second enquiry X do not find any other undertaking given by Sultan faimur which mignt be affect, ed by the present Sultan's claim of right of repudiation. * I am sending a copy of tnis letter to Peel.

UvjuijJL Pz.s/Wgj. / In 1923 the then Sultan of Muscat gave an undertaking that he would not exploit any petroleum which may he found anywhere within his territories and would not grant permission for its exploitation without consulting the Political Agent at Muscat and without the approval of the Government of India. A copy of the undertaking is flagged helow. 2. In 1936 Petroleum Concessions Ltd. were permitted to open negotiations v/ith the Sultan on the understanding that any concession granted would he subject to the approval of H.M.G. and would he accompanied hy the usual 'Political” Agreement between the Company and H.M.G. 3. After some delay (due mainly to the absence of the Sultan from his capital) the Company was successful in obtaining two concessions from the Sultan, one in respect of the province of Dhofar and the other in regard to the whole of Muscat territories excluding Dhofar and the oversea enclave of Gwadur. Copies of the two concessions are flagged below. They are modelled on the common form which has been adopted by the Company for Arabian oil concessions and do not differ in any material way which affects Government from the drafts originally submitted by the Company in 1936 when they secured the approval of H.M.G. to open negotiations. 4. The concessions were signed without any concurrent reservation in writing to the effect that they are subject to the approval of H.M.G. (as is required by the 1923 undertaking), but the Sultan was informed orally at the time of signature by the Political Agent of the necessity for a Political Agreement between H.M.G. and the Company and Exchange of 7173 Wt 8900/111 10.000 4.38 Notes/ — x' Notes 'between H.M.G. , the Sultan and the Company. When, however, drafts of the Political Agreement and complementary Exchange of Notes were submitted to the Sultan Isst November (at Bombay on the eve of his departure on his R-oyal tour) His Highness first took the line that it had not been made clear to him before he signed the concession Agreements that they were subject to the approval of H.M.G. etc. and then proceeded to raise all sorts of objections to the terms of the drafts. The Political Agent’s report on his interview with the Sultan is flagged at P.Z.88/38 below. The Political Resident’s comments thereon are flagged at P.Z.603/38. Time did not permit of the matter being pursued further before the Sultan left India on his world tour and at his request discussions were resumed during his recent visit to London. In the interval the drafts were here in the light of the Sultan’s known objections in consultation with the interested departments of H.M.G. with the object of reducing them as far as possible to a form which might be more acceptable to him. For this purpose it was proposed that there should be two political agreements viz. (a) a 'general” agreement with which the Sultan would be associated by an Exchange of Letters, and (b) an agreement dealing with 'pre-emption' which would not be shown to the Sultan at all. At a later stage the possibility was considered of concluding a single comprehensive agreement with the Company without bringing the sultan into the matter at all; but as this course was felt to be rather a pis aller ^though not altogether impossible^it was decided, after hearing the Sultan’s views, to endeavour to secure his assent to an exchange of letters relating to the proposed 'general' agreement. Records of two discussions with the Sultan on the subject are flagged at A and B below, from which it will be observed/Minute Paper. Department. observed that the Sultan eventually agreed, subject to certain unimportant modifications, to an exchange of letters relating to the suggested general agreement. The present position is that the terms of this general agreement, of the complementary letter to the Sultan and of the separate agreement relating to pre-emption, ^draf Is of which will be found immediately below this submission) have been accepted by the interested Departments of H.M.G. and by the Company and sanction is now sought to conclude the two agreements forthwith.

P ,Z jZ 179/Z8. dated the 10th I.lay 1938, regarding the oil concessions granted by the Sultan of Muscat to Petroleum Concessions Limited? 2. You will have received Fowle f s comments contained 4 . 5*0 &lt;7 in his demi-rOfficial letter No.C/351 of the 20th June 1938 of which a copy was sent to you. The Government of India agree with these comments as stated in paragraphs 2 to 7 of his letter and with his proposals as to the procedure to be adopted regarding the Political Agreement and Draft Letter No.I. 3. Fowle has now produced a copy of Sultan Said Tsimur's letter of the 19th March 1923, which the present Sultan has quoted, but he has not commented on the effect which this letter has on the Sultan’s repudiation of his father’s ooligations. It seems to the Government of India that the matter is not entirely free from difficulty, since it is clear that Sultan Taimur in 1923 definitely declared that no agreement entered into by him would be binding upon his successors, unless the agreement itself contained a mention Of: his successors. The undertaking regarding oil contained January 1923 (v ldeI - 2 - (Vide Aitchison r s Treaties Vol.XI page 319) includes no mention of his successors, so that there is some force in the Sultan f s argument that, in view of his father T s letter, the undertaking with regard to oil did not descend to him and was not covered by his own letter of 10th February 1932 Kis Majesty f s Govt, can presumably reply that the Political Resident of the time declined to accept Sultan Taimur f s letter, and conveyed a personal message to the Sultan through the Political Agent,Muscat that it would be most inadvisable in the Sultan f s own interest for any such be general declaration as His Highness proposed to/forwarded to Government. The Sultan did not protest or insist upon his declaration being forwarded and since neither the Govt, of India nor His Majesty f s Govt, were informed of the letter, they do not consider themselves bound by its terms. The validity of such a rejoinder is perhaps open to doubt, but it appears from your letter P.Z.2210/38 of the 19th May 1938 that His Highness the Sultan is actuated rather by motives of prestige than by any desire to embarrass Government and if his M amour propre' is satisfied by the procedure now suggested by Fowle, it is perhaps un necessary to pursue the question further in connection with the undertaking of 1923 regarding oil.' -3- I am sending a copy of this letter to R.

As you will see, the Government of India have taken the view that Sultan Taimur's letter of March 1923 does not justify the present Sultan’s repudiation of his father's undertakings, since that letter was never accepted by His Majesty’s Govt, or the Govt.of India. I do not know,however, how far that argument would be valid and 1 have there fore examined as a matter of interest the other undertakings given by Sultan Taimur regarding which the present Sultan could take up a similar attitude • So far as 1 can discover from Aitchison’s ireaties the only other undertaking of a perpetual nature entered into by Sultan Taimur was No.XIX of the 17th February 1921 adhering to the Arms Traffic Convention of 1919. In this undertakirg; there is no mention of the Sultan’s successors, so that the position is precisely the same as in the case of No.XX regarding oil. I am not sure whether the Sultan of Muscat’s adherence to the Arms Traffic Convention of 1919 is at present of any practical importance or not. Would you be kind enou^i to give us your views on this point and also let us know if there are any other undertakings of Sultan Taimur s which might be affected by the present Sultan’s argument.I am sending a copy of this letter to Peel* « Yours sincerely, The Hon’ble Lt.Col.

Undoubtedly what Sir Percy Cox promised to our late father Saiyid Faisal for this important matter was for the State and not for him (S.Faisal) personally.

Your Highness once more represents that the grant was hereditary and not personal; and requests that the High Government be moved to reconsider the case, I regret to have to maice it quite clear to Your Highness that the High British Government's decision was absolutely final; and that no advantage whatever would come from representing the matter to it again; more especially as I myself was closely concerned in the negotiations which led to the suppression of the Arms Traffic, and would be obliged to confess to the High Government that tne subsidy in question was meant as a personal gift to sultan Faisal for his life time only? and » so it was understood by all of us. As your fatner’s death, which I have never ceased to deplore, followed so closely after the conclusion of that Agreement, the High Government no doubt, among other important reasons, thought it desirable that the Muscat ruling family should not thus be deprived of reasonable compensation for the loss to which they were put by the decrease of the Arms Traffic; and therefore continued the subsidy as a favour to Your Highness, the successor of Sultan Faisal.

These are:- (1) the araft 1 General 1 Agreement,^as accepted by the oultar^; (2) the draft Agreement relating to pre-emption. I also submit a fair copy of the draft letter to the Sultan in regard to (l). In his minute of the 25th April, 1938, (P.Z.3153/ 38, flagged ’K 1 ) Mr. Beckett suggested that if the Sultan was not to be associated with the Political Agreement^the recitals at the beginning of the Agreement should include a reference to the fact that the commercial concessions were suoject to the consent of H.M.vj-. and that H.M.G. had consented thereto . So far as the proposed 'General' Agreement is concerned, it is^of course^unnecessary to adopt Mr. Beckett's suggestion. In any case, I do not think that we could include the words under-lined since H.M.G. do not in fact approve the concessions until all the formalities connected with the Political Agreement have been concluded. Por these reasons, and also because it might oe dilficult to explain any difference of wording to the Company, I have left the recitals in both Agreements unaltered, and we might leave it to the Foreign Office to revive the question. 7173 Wt 8900/111 10,000 4.38At an earlier stage the Company made an oral suggestion that Article 4 of the uraft ’General’ Agreement should be-omitted on the ground that it would require the Company to keep a British subject more or less permanently in Muscat even in the earliest stages, when there would be really no wor*. for him to do. This point was recently discussed with Mr. Longrigg, who stated that it will meet the Company's point, if we indicate in writing that it is understood that the Company will not be required to appoint a Chief Local Representative until the Company's activities justify such an appointment. vVe must now ascertain whether the other interested Departments concur in the two drafts. The next step will be to submit the drafts to the Company for their approval, and if they agree the way is clear to conclude the Agreements. After the signature of the Agreements, it is proposed to authorise the Political Resident to address a letter to the Sultan in the terms of the draft flagged at ’M’ below. The final act will be a letter to the Sultan informing him, with reference to his father's undertaking of 1923, that H.M.G. have no objection to the concessions granted to the Company.

In the meantime we understand that a further approach has been made to the Sultan and that he has agreed to associate himself with an agreement, in regard to the Muscat and Dhofar Commercial Oil Concessions, between His Majesty’s Government and the concessionaire. i/ J.P. Gibson, Esq. SECd. rcrr.' - &lt; [.'AY 1938 i INDIA OFFICE] &gt;I nevertneless enclose a copy of a minute by Beckett, written when the question of no longer attempting to bring the Sultan into tne proposed political agreement was under examination.50 5/137/91) As Mr. Gibson states in his letter P.Z. 2255/38 of the 23rd April, the whole object of this elaborate scheme of the communication of the Political Agreement to the Sultan, the exchange of notes with the Sultan and the further exchange of notes with the company was to enable the Sultan to teminate the concession if the company broke the political Agreement and as far as possible to bind the Sultan to do so; in other words, to have the sanction of the termination of the concession to ensure the performance by the company of the Political Agreement. If all this procedure has to be abandoned then the sanction for the performance by the company of the Political Agreement becomes (l) the influence which H.M.G. can exercise with the company; (2) the enforcement of the Political Agreement in the courts here. As regards (l) other people are in a better position to express an opinion than I am. (^estion (2) is one on which the Treasury Solicitor might be consulted if more information is required, but I will make a few remarks upon it, taking the provisions of the Political Agreement in order to see how the position stands. The first question is whether the agreement is one which could be enforceable in the courts of this country at all, and I think the answer to this is in principle, in the affirmative, though except as regards the pre-emption clause, the provisions of the agreement are not very suitable for such a procedure. In order however to show that there is ' , consideration ,, (i.e. that there was■; oT) ■V a quid pro quo in return for which the company have thus bound themselves), I think the recitals at the beginning of the ii | agreement might be reconsidered and the fact that the concession V&amp;v ^ ! from the Sultan was subject to the consent of and that lb* r M J \ H.M.G. have consented thereto, in return for this agreement, \might be brought out. ‘ t U Sh'S* Clauses (l) and (2) of the Political Agreement provide ) that the company shall remain a British company and that shall not transfer the concession to anybody except It with H.M.G.’s consent. I think that these provisions (/v,&lt;^Arv( ( ^ would be enforceable through the courts and that provided H.M.G. V' heard of it in time, they could probably get clause (2) Cv/ ssj- (jA ^ 1 enforced by an injunction. Damages for an unauthorised Pitt transfer would hardly be a possible remedy or sanction. fofh &gt; / n I Conceivably, but I am not quite sure, clauses (3) to (5) ^ (MM CtfvwtkvW ,k*' might be enforceable through the English courts by orders s\ + . 1 ^ f or S p ec ifi c performance. fU tvvvito ^ v ( ^ ^ As regards clause (7) conceivably a claim for damages Ijs* Rtf' Su* [Mfrl % could be put forward so far as areas selected by H.M.G. were concerned and would be an effective deterrent. Clause (8) might possibly be made the subject of an injunction (I ought to have indicated above that this agreement would of course not merely be enforceable against the company so long as it remained British in the courts in this country, but also in the courts of the political Agent in Muscat). Clause (9) - pre-emption - would clearly be enforceable by the courts and under the new arrangement I do not see why it should not stay where it is, i.e. in the body of the political agreement and not in a separate document; it is a clause which could be enforced by an order for specific performance or by judgment for damages.

PETROLEUM DEPARTMENT (Mines Department), Dean Stanley Street, Millbank, London, S.W.l. dp April, 1938. v My dear GiBson, 11 I am sorry that I was unable to see you the other day when you called to see me about the Muscat and Oman Political Agreement. In reply to your letter (P.Z. 2255/38) of 23rd April, in which you ask for our concurrence in the proposal to conclude a political agreement with the Company leaving the Sultan out of it altogether, I am sure you appreciate that the original idea of- the political agreement was largely to ensure as strong a form of British control clause as was practicable with an international company like the Iraq Petroleum Company (or Petroleum Concessions Ltd.). There can be no guarantee that the status of the company will not be altered in the absence of a specific provision for a penalty which would involve cancellation of the concession. RECo. P t. If the provision in the commercial agreement 2 *7 APR 1938 (Clause 23) stands, a subsidiary company registered in the INDIA OFFICE ——— British Empire could hold the concession, and as such a J. P. Gibson, Esq., India Office, Kir&gt;g Charles Street, S.W. 1.H- C ^vtvvc [D i/) ktbfyb-J !%&lt;. 2 V f \company would not be required to have its principal place of business in this country nor a British Chairman, it seems to me that the prospect of being able successfully to impose any penalty on the parent company would be remote. If the commercial agreement had not been signed I should have been in favour of trying to get an amendment to meet the point, and Fraser, the Deputy Chairman of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co., with whom I have discussed the point confidentially, would have done all he could to secure this. As the agreement has been signed this is not practicable and we must, I think, concur in the proposal to drop the idea of tying up the Commercial and Political Agreement in this case, provided, of course, it is not to be taken as in any way creating a precedent for other concessions which may be negotiated hereafter. I assume that you will let us see the Political Agreement with the company in draft, before it is finally signed and sealed. I am sending a copy of this letter to Seal and Brenan.

As a matter of tactics we have felt that it would be best to postpone discussing this question with the Sultan until the 'treaty” talks were concluded. That stage has now been reached and the Sultan has himself told us tha.t he would like to discuss the question; but from casual hints which he has let fall it is abundantly clear that except under strong pressure he will not have anything to do with the agreement himself. In iUc such circumstances we have been reconsidering the whole question and particularly from the point of view whether it is really essentia.l to obtain the Sultan’s co-operation. Cur views are set out in the enclosed departmental note and we should be glad to hear as soon as possible whether th^Foreign 0 ^.! t «, iC Office would see any objection to bur proceeding on the lines suggested therein. The matter is of great urgency/H’rom casual hints which the Sultan has let fall since his arrival it is abundantly clear that^except under strong pressure^he will not h«ve anything to do with the proposed Political Agreement between H.M.G. and the concession Company. It is true that when the matter was discussed with him at Bombay last November he went so far as to criticise certain Articles of the draft which was put before him by the Political Agent, but since that time his has stiffened and in such circumstances it seems desirable to consider whether it is really essential to obtain his co-operation. The procedure which we^ had in mind (and which has been adopted in the case of two of the Trucial Sheikhs) is as follows:- First, the Agreement between H.l'.G. and the concession Company; next, an Exchange of Notes with the Sultan in which the latter v/ould take note that in the event of a. serious breach of the Agreement on the part of the Company he would have the right to terminate the Commercial Concession, and would agree to accept the advice of H.M.G. in regard to this right of termination; next, an Exchange of Notes with the concession Company in which the latter would accept the arrangements embodied in the Exchange of Notes with the Sultan as binding on the Company; and finally, a letter to the Company and the Sultan intimating that H.M.G. approve the commercial agreement. Stated bluntly the sole object of bringing in the Rulers concerned is to provide a sanction against the C om pany/I^ay H possible” because the most v/e can hope for is that the sultan would necree to accept our ”advice” in the matter and we oh-euld*^^ have no effective redress if he failed to do so. Company and what we have to consider now is whether^in x the case of Muscat^this ’’possible” sanction can be disregarded. The answer would seem to depend on whether we can rely on the concession holding Company remaining a British company. This Department is not in a position to form an opinion on thtr point, but from tentative soundings which have/been made at the Petroleum Department and at the Foreign Office it would ivG-vM?* that there is little likelihood of the Iraq Petroleum Company (the parent Company) or its subsidiaries becoming non-British; and even although the political agreement itself does not include a penalty clause (and it does not seem desirable that it should do so) it is thought that so long as the Company remains British we shall always be in a. position to see that tha Company fulfils its obligations to H.M.G. That being so it is ftfcvViAAAtt that we might take the risk of leaving out the Sultan. If this view is accepted we should then conclude an agreement with the Company, somewhat on the lines of the original draft, and thereafter inform both the Company and the Sultan that H.K.G. approve the commercial agreement. In communicating the decision to the Sultan it would seem advisable to connect it with the undertaking given by his predecessor in 1923. Sir Trenchard Fowle agrees with the foregoing.p. z.n V 2'lOt M. 01469/38 F !938 Military Branch, ADMIRALTY, S.W.l. 30th March, 1938.

The Political Agreement regarding our Oman and Dhofar Concessions will, of course, require the seal of the Company, and, as the form of Agreement is to vary somewhat from the form to which the Board have already agreed, it will probably be thought necessary to refer the matter back to them. I can do no more, therefore, at the moment than indicate what I think to be the probabi lity of the Board’s attitude. I do not feel that the Board will have any objection to the draft which accompanies your letter under reply, particularly if you could see your way to re instate Article 11 of the Sharjah Agreement, the omission of which from your first draft of the Oman Agreement was, you will remember, regretted by the Board: the second paragraph of my PC.31/464 of September 27 th, 1937* refers to this. Secondly, would it not be better that the Agreement should be made between Petroleum Development (Oman and Dhofar) Limited, which is now the responsible holder of the Concessions, rather than Petroleum Concessions Limited, which is no longer the holder? This would perhaps involve the alteration of the word ’’obtained” in the Pre-amble of your draft. Yours sincerely. J.P. Gibson, Esq., India Office, Whitehall.

In consequence of certain objections raised by the Sultan during the discussions v/hich took place last November at Bombay with Major Watts in regard to this matter, we have found it necessary to reconsider the form of agreement. 3. In a recent letter from America the Sultan stated that he propose^, to discuss the question with H.M.G. during use. jr&gt;Jt4A4. his forthcoming visit, and-, although f much will depend un the result^ of these discussions^ dur provisional view, is that it would be preferable to have / tv/o separate Agreements, viz. (a) a general Agreement, something on the lines of the enclosed draft, the prinerdes of which would have to be accepted by the Sultan in an Exchange of Notes; and (b) a separate Agreement in regard to •vicc^C pre-emption which weuld not be shov/n to the Sultan at all. 4. At this stage we should be glad ifyou would let us know whether the above procedure would be likely to be acceptable to the Company, and, if so, whether they have any observations to offer on the suggested draft General Agreement. If you think it would be useful, we might have an informal discussion one day early next week. 5. There are two points in regard to this General Agreement which it might be useful to put in writing at this stage, viz. (1) As regards A r ticle 4, you will see that the suggested redraft does not go as far as the corresponding original Article. We assume, however, that the Company will^as a matter of course^consult H.M. G. in regard to any important matter affecting their relations with the Sultan, and that the Company’s local representatives will at all times keep the Political Agent fully informed regarding local events. (2) As regards Article 7, it is proposed to include- in the Exchange of Notes &amp; sentence to tho offr^t that the words 'sites which may have been selected by, or on behalf of, the Sultan' must be deemed to include the sites which the Sultan has leased to H.

To The Honourable my respected frienvd Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle^ Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. After Complimentsj There is no doubt Your Honour is aware of the matter and you will also hear from the Consul at Muscat of my reply to him with further explanations. As you will understand from the purx)ort of my reply to the Consul, I never expected that such a matter as this would arise, after I had signed the agreement with the Oil Company, you had informed me that they would come to me to negotiate in respect of oil developments in my state, and for that I thank you. But my requesting you to find me a British Company for oil development in my state was due to the old firm friendship existing between me and the Honourable friend the British Government. Perhaps you will remember that when you visited Muscat in the month of April last, we discussed the matter of the lateness of the arrival of the Company’s representative, whom you said would arrive at Muscat at that time to discuss oil affairs. You did not mention to me that the question of an agreement with the Company you had introduced could not be concluded except with the conclusion of a political agreement between them and the British Government and that I also would be involved in this matter. All these months have passed since concluding the agreement with the Company in June last in the presence of the Consul, when suddenly I receive the letter in question and the documents which the Consul sent to me and which I had never expected, because the Consul had I did not at all understand that the case/ never informed me.2. case was so. Had I known then what I know now, I would not have entered into an agreement with the Company without first asking you to let me know about the political agreement. Then v/hon I had acquainted myself with it and seen what I considered best for my Government I would have intimated my views to you. As you are aware, entering into a commercial agreement is quite different from entering into a political agreement with a Government. There is no doubt that the Government would not wish me to be treated in a way which might bring trouble upon me from a political point of view. I am not accustomed to such things. How was I to understand or to know what to expect ’.hen the Company approached me for negotiation? I have read the documents sent to me. I frankly say, as you know, I habitually treat you without reserve in all matters v/hich concern you, because I rely on my own firm friendship with you and your friendship towards me. I do not fully understand the sentences written nor their object, neither do I know' what will be the result and effect to my Government in the future if I enter into an agreement such as this political agreement. I assure you that I w r as neither informed by the Consul nor did he ’write to me that this matter '/as dependent on conditions such as have now presented. Had I been informed or received a letter earlier or had I notified in 'writing the Honourable Government in •writing that I had been informed and had accepted such terms then there would have been no objection. Had the matter been as brief as I was led to believe from their Consul at Muscat on the day of the signing of the agreement with the Company, or even on the steamer on our journey to India in the month of June of last year, that is to say that a political agreement Y-ould be concluded bet’ween the Government and the Company which would not concern me nor would it affect the terms of theagreement concluded 'between me and the Company ? I would no o have- written this lonp letter to you. But as this matter nas arisen contrary to my expectation, I considered it necessary to explain the matter in my letter to the Consul and in this my letter to you, so that you and the Honouraole Government may know the real facts from the 'beginning and in order to ovoid misunderstandine which I believe the Honourable Government dislike as much as I. I wish to a- d that I do not see why I should not have been informed in writing before sending of the Company’s representative and the opening of negotiations with them or the Conclusion of the agreement that a political matter would arise. I hove fully explained above everything to you about the matter and how it came to me from the Consul and when. I request you to convey the text of my reply to the Consul and also this letter verbatim to the Honourable friend His Britannic Majesty’s Government, so that they may know the real facts, and I thank you. when I am in London, God willing, I shall point out this matter to His Britannic Majesty’s Government and I am sure that they will not agree to such an affair. In conclusion I offer you high regards. Your sincere friend. Sa’id bin Taimur. Dated 23th Dhil-Hijjah 1356 (1st March 1938).Copy After sincere greetings, on 37 November 1937 we received from your esteemed hand your letter No* Lblank] dated 37 November 1937 at Bombay, which we opened before you. Having begun to read its contents, we immediately informed you that we did not understand its contents: for you had not previously informed us, either before or after the jr-e-n and conclusion of the with the Company petroleum contract/^ which you brought to us in accordance with our request for that purpose, that we should receive a letter of this sort from you. On no previous occasion have you said or written to us, neither have we understood from you, nor does it fall within the conditions agreed upon between Is and this Company, that the matter is still in suspense, as you state in your aforementioned letter: in fact, according to what we understood and knew, the matter was concluded, and there remained nothing for us to enter into, such as this political contract or otherwise. All that concerns us and matters to us and is binding upon us is what accords with what is stated in the contract with the Company: this we accepted, and this the Company accepted; and you affixed your signature as witness, in your capacity as Consul of the British Government, to all the copies of the contract, in the presence of ourselves and of the Company’s representative who had come to Muscat. Accordingly, it is necessary that we should set forth in every detail all the circumstances, from the time when we applied to you, and you undertook to choose for us, an English Company, to come to us through your mediation to prospect for petrol in part of our territories, up to our receiving from you the above-mentioned letter, in order that Kis Brittanic Majesty’s Government, our friend, may be informed, and that there may be no ambiguity about the matter.wgmmm 2 Gins' Three years ago, before we journeyed to at the end of 1935, we asked you to undertake to look for and choose for us an English Company which should prospect for petrol in our territories, stating that we deliberately preferred and desiied that it should be an English company, because of the friendship which we entertain for our friend the British Government: and this is not concealed from the Government. In the year 1936, when you visited us at you informed us that you had discovered an English company which was desirous of entering into a contract with us, and that its representative would come to us after our return to Muscat. We were pleased with this ne/vs. After we had returned to Muscat, at the beginning of last year, and you had returned to Muscat from Karachi in March of the ssjue year, you delivered to us a letter from a gentleman named Mr Holmes, and stated that he would represent the Company, and that he desired to come as quickly as possible, for the purpose of negotiations. We immediately signified to you our agreement to receive him, and you promised that he should arrive very quickly: but he did not arrive quickly, as he had inxormed you. The Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf came to Muscat during last April, and I enquired about the said gentleman: he stated that he would arrive shortly. We continued to expect him: but he had not come, wnen the time came for our journey to India, in the month of June. A week before we were due to depart, you came to us, and informed us that you had learned from the Company that one of their men, LeryxiM-JL called Mr Laiafre* would reach Muscat during that week for this purpose, in place of Mr Holmes: you would therefore ask us to postpone our departure for another week, until the said gentleman had arrived, and conversations with him had taken place.■ — For the sake of general advantage we acceded to your request, and postponed our journey. Mr Lasae^t arrived at Muscat. You wrote us a letter, informing us of this, and stating that you considered it ^ to 'be appropriate to send him to us alone, 'because the matter was a personal one between us and a trading company, and no concern of yours. We immediately replied that that was not possible, because v/e did not know the Company: you had introduced it to us, and therefore we requested that you should accompany the gentleman, in order to make us acquainted with each other, after which conversat ions might proceed between us and him. You agreed that this 7 /as well, and did as we had requested. After we had been introduced to the Company’s man, he presented to us the Company’s terns, and negotiations proceeded with him, until finally 7/e and he agreed upon the contract on £4 June 1937. Before signing, we sent to you and asked you to be present with us. You came, and we then began to initial the copies of the contract: you signed them as a 7 /itness, in your capacity as consul of the British G-overnment. I You then said to us that our friend His Majesty’s Government would make a political contract with this Company, because it 7 /as an English company: since the Government had assisted the Company by introducing it to us, it would therefore be necessary for the Company to be bound in an agreement with the Government in respect of certain of its profits. You also stated that if this company had not been English, the British Government Y/ould not have been concerned at all with such a contract as this. We never heard or understood more than this from you. When v/e asked you whether this contract had any concern or effect on the conditions of our contract with the Company, or whether v/e were concerned in it, you informed us that we might rest assured that we were not concerned with this contract, which was only the affair of the Company and the Government. We replied to you that, since the matter stood thus, there was no objection.lufYnOi After we had finished initialing the contract, Mr Lameet said that he would travel with us in the same steamer in which we and you would proceed to Karachi, in order that he might sent the head copies of the contract to their/office in London for sealing. He paid over to us the sum required at that time, in consideration of the initialing of the contract. The said gentleman sailed with us on 25 June: during the journey on the steamer, we several times met you and Mr Lumeet, and in one of our meetings discussion centred round petroleum, and our territory, and in the course of conversation you spoke of the contract which the G-overnment would make with the Company, in the same terms as we have already mentioned. We neither heard nor understood from you more than that. After our arrival at Karachi, Mr Lomeet fell dll; but after a few days he recovered: for this reason we visited you in the hotel in which you were both staying, and in your presence Mr “£erwv&gt; Lame-et took from us a copy of the contract and the adjustments which we had made with him, and which were part of the terms. He gave us a receipt on receiving this, because he wished to send it to London with the other copies which he had, as we have mentioned above. Thereafter we signed receipts for the money, and you witnessed this: then we and the said gentleman went to the Eastern was Bank at Karachi: we met the manager, he paid us the money, and It/ put // into our account, and the matter was concluded. Then we journeyed to Kashmir, for a change of air, this being in the middle of July. After we had returned to Muscat, and you had returned there also, several days passed, during v/hich you neither mentioned nor wrote to us anything in this connection. Before we departed for Delhi, Mr Lameet came to Muscat, bringing with him copies of the contract: he desired us to sign certain adjustments which were in the contract, and we signed them. Ho enquiry passed as to whether the contract was waiting upon anything else. ThenI 11 ' k came the time for our departure for Delhi. We sailed: our visit ended, we came down to Bombay, and you came to us to talk over certain questions, and to meet Mr Loh^ri^^e, one of the said ^Company’s directors, who had come from London, desiring to meet us. We met the said gentleman in your presence, because you had brought him for the purpose of introduction. We and he conversed about the matter on behalf of which he had come, and you left us. Then on the following day he visited us again in your presence, and you mentioned nothing about this matter. On 27 November 1937, three days before our departure from India, you visited us, and delivered to us the letter referred to at the beginning of this letter, requesting that we should write you an answer before leaving Bombay. We replied that we could not write any answer, because we did not understand anything of the contents of the letter and the papers at that time; that we had not expected to receive a letter like that, since v/e had not previously understood the contents of what you had written in the said letter; that we must expose everything to the Government in a letter in | reply to you, and that after consideration; that when we came to London, God willing, we should be constrained to examine with the | officials there this matter about which we had known nothing oefore entering into the contract with the Company. As you know, an engagement by a trade contract is different from an engagement by a political contract: in such important political questions as this, it is necessary for you to write us a letter, in order that you may know from our answer to it whether we agree or not. lou also know that we do not desire to engage our government by any what will be political contracts,/the future influence of which/we do not know. V/e are certain that the British Government in London does not consent that we should be treated by you in this manner: we always have, and always shall treat you in all matters of negotiation between us with complete frankness, according as is demanded by the \ ... - .. - — —iw.m firm friendship existing between us and our friend the British ? Government. You neither wrote to us officially, nor informed us by word of mouth, before the conclusion of the contract with the ^Company, about this matter, in order that we might consider it, ^ and see what was the advantageous course fpr our government. If the matter is as you state at the commencement of your letter, why did the Company’s representative initial and accept the tenps, and why did he pay over the money? Why did you sign the contract? If the matter were still in suspense, waiting upon another condition beside the ter^is which were agreed upon by us and the Company when we initialed the contract , we should never have initialed the contract, nor received the money in July: and we have since received the amount due for the first half of this ye car, in advance. We cannot therefore understand anything of these matters, since we are now being treated in a manner different from that to which we were previously accustomed from you. «e hope this that you will communicate the text of/our letter to our friend the British Government in London as quickly as possible, in order that it may understand the actual facts: and we thank you. As you know, we do not like that any bad understanding should arise between us and our friend the Government at all: this is a matter which we do not desire,akd we trust that the Government also does not desire it. We hope that the question is now made clear to you, and that there is no ambiguity in it. When we come to London, we shall inform the Government about this matter, and we shall set forth to them other things beside of which we are acquainted, in order that they may know of them, and in order that the facts of the case may become clear to them: for we fear that other such matters may arise on the part of her representatives at Muscat, and we affirm our firm friendship for the Government.7 Up to the present, the Company has not returned to us the copy of the contract which belongs to us, and which it took from us for sealing in London and return to us. We hope that you will request ^ the Company to return it to us, because that happened in your presence at Karachi. It is understood that we will not agree to be bound to the Company by any condition over and above what is mentioned in the contract which was completed between us and the Company last year: whatever we have accepted in the contract with the Company, that we shall perform, and similarly the Company on her part will abide by its compact with us. In conclusion, we thank you. Farewell.

Dear Gibson, We have been going into the questions raised in your letter PZ 603/38 of the 2nd March on the draft Political Agreement between His Majesty’s Government and Petroleum Concessions Limited in respect of the Muscat Oil Concessions, and now have to offer the following observations on the various points set out in the note attched to your letter# 2 . Articles 1 and 2. We concur. Article 3. Presumably the words ’’Ruler concerned'' will be replaced by 'His Highness the Sultan of Muscat”. Unless there is some objection it seems reasonable, if only to satisfy His Highness 1 amour propre » to provide for his consent, as well as the consent of His Majesty’s Government, to the engagement by the Company of persons of any nationality other than Muscati or British. We suggest therefore that the word ’’consent” be followed fcy/ J.P.Gibson Esq.’ by the words ’’of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat and of •'His Majesty's Government' If this provision is made it might meet the Sultan's objections. Article 4 . For the reasons explained above, insert after 'approval' the words 'of His Highness the Sultan and'. Otherwise we agree to the omission of the whole article. Article 5. We agree, Article 7. On giving further consideration to the text of this article we feel that the draft as it stands does in fact seem to imply that His Majesty's Government can, ex nroprio motu. select any area in Muscat for the purpose of defence, aerodromes etc. wireless and telegraph installations and in connexion with the development of harbours. Clearly this is inconsistent with the Sultan's independence, so it is perhaps not surprising that he has not taken this fence. Furthermore it occurs to us that in view of our obligations under the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862 and of the need arising therefrom, to exercise extreme caution in concluding any lease in the name of His Majesty's Government of territory in Muscat and even greater circumspection in referring to such leases in agreements with third parties it would perhaps have been better to avoid putting forward such a draft article/&lt;s$&gt; article for inclusion in an agreement with the Company. (See Laithwaite's memorandum of the 2nd November, 1934 P.Z. 6811/38 paragraphs 26 et seq). We suggest therefore for consideration that it will he best to omit all reference to His Majesty’s Government in the text of the article and instead to put in note No.l to the Sultan a sentence to the effect that the words H sites which may ’’have been selected by or on behalf of His Highness the ’’Sultan” in Article 7 of the Political Agreement concluded between His Majesty’s Government and the Company must be deemed to include the sites which His Highness has leased to His Majesty’s Government, and that there should be a similar separate exchange of letters between His Majesty’s Government and the Company placing this on record. Article 9. This deals with the pre-emption clause. There is, so we are advised by Beckett, no reason why His Majesty's Government should not conclude an agreement providing for pre-emption with a British Company, not because it drav/s its oil from the territory of the Sultan of Muscat but because it jls a British Company, and it is no infringement of the Sultan’s sovereignty over the territory from which the oil comes for His Majesty’s Government to do this. But to this argument it would be open/4./ open to the Sultan to reply that His Majesty’s Government is at liberty to make their agreement with the Company without making him a party to it by including it in the Political Agreement which he has to concur in and enforce, as there is no reason v/hy he should enforce such a provision. For this reason it seems that the appropriate solution would be to take the pre-emption clause out of the Political Agreement and embody it in a separate agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Company which is not produced to the Sultan at all* From the formal point of view this arrangement would mean that His Majesty’s Government could not compel the Sultan to forfeit the Company’s concession because of failure to observe the pre-emption agreement. It is not thought however that this is of any great practical importance. There must be other ways in which the pre-emption agreement could be enforced through the Courts here against a British Company, and plenty of steps which could be taken under emergency legislation in Englai d against the Company if they failed to observe it. 3 . As regards the paragraph in Article 10 to which the Sultan has raised objections we agree v/ith the views set out on page 7 of Symon’s note.4. Finally there remains paragraph 3 (a) of the Draft Note No.l . The Sultan is not in fact being quite logical in objecting to this particular clause if he accepts the other clauses of the draft note, but to point this out to him might merely lead him to say that he must refuse the Draft Note altogether. The passage is not really of great importance if we make sure that there is, in effect, no conflict between the terms of the two instruments.

Subject to minor adjustments the draft agreement submitted to the Sultan of Muscat follows the lines of the Debai and Shargah Political Agreements. These Agreements, in their turn, follow the lines of the similar Agreements in respect of Koweit and Q,atar. 3. Before attempting to examine the Muscat draft in the light of the known objections raised by the Sultan it seems desirable to consider whether there is any real necessityin the case of Muscat to apply all the political conditions which were felt to be necessary in the case of the other Arab States. As regards the latter our aim has been to secure the most satisfactory terms which the Com pani es concerned could be persuaded to accept and hitherto it has not been necessary to give serious consideration to the position of the Rulers concerned; but our relations with Muscat are on an entirely different footing to those with the Arab States generally and in view of the gultan’s independent position we ought perhaps to ensure that as far as possible the proposed Political Agreement between H.M.G. and the concession Company does not contain anything which could be regarded by the Sultan as derogatory to his rights as an independent Ruler. 4. The more important provisions of the existing Political Agreements may be summarised as follows:- (a)/(a) (1) The C orapany shall he and remain a British Corr Tpany re^i st er ed in Gr eat Bri tain an d havin g ite 'p riTTcFpal pla ce of 'buaine aB in Great* 'Br'r tain (Xrt i cl e sub . para. (3 ) )V (^) The .Agreement b etv/een the Gompany snd the Ruler concerned shall not be t ransferred with out. th e pri o r con s ent in wr iti ng o_ f~ [Art! cle 2 T. H.M.G. attach considerable importance to these conditions and they ought to be included in the Muscat Agreement. As they do not affect the Sultan's interests it is difficult to see what grounds he could find for obj ecting. (b) The local emplo yees of the Company sh all at all times be British subj ects or subjects of the Ruler 'concerned . provided 'tliat wi tn th£ consent ^If.M .G. su ch 'persons of other nationa lity a s are requ ired for t he effic i ent carrying on o f the und ertaking * may bV empl *o*yed TA.~rti cl e ♦ As regards the Arab States generally H.M.G. attach great importance to the condition th^t the local % personnel operating the concessions should be either exclusively or as far as possible British subjects or the subjects of the Ruler concerned. The reasons for this are concisely set out in our letter to the Foreign Office of the 13th January.1934, No. P. Z. 28 6/34. (copy flagged *4- D -b ol ow'i.

Some provision of this sort is obviously desirable in the case of Muscat. (f) Provision for pr e-empti on in time of war The Admiralty attach considerable importance to the pre-emption condition and we must insist upon its inclusion in the Muscat Agreement. Great care was taken in drafting the pre-emption clause and it seems undesirable to make any attempt to modify it. 5. It is now proposed, in the light of the foregoing, to consider the Sultan’s specific objections. Artie 1 e 1 (Preamb 1 e) . His Highness objects to the following words in sub.para.( 2 ):- ’’whereas certain responsibilities will devolve on H.M.G.” 6474b Wt 22530/P 114 10,000 9.37 10P The/The Political Resident suggests that as the words objected to are in the nature of a preamble they might possibly be dropped unless the Sultan gives way. T ?e can agree to this - or alternatively the sentence might be redrafted as f ollows:- ”whereas by treat:^, capi tul ation, grsnt, u sage sufferance and other lawful m eans certairT responsibilities will devolve on H.M.G.' This should make it clear to the Sultan that we are referring to responsibilities derived from our Treaty rights etc., and since the words underlined are taken from the Muscat Order in Council they can hardly be objected to by the Sultan. Artic le 3. His Highness objects to the second part of this Article and the Political Resident suggests that his objections might be got over by substituting 'experts' for 'persons'. The Resident also suggests that it could be explained to the Sultan that the object of this clause is to ensure th^t the Company employs as few foreign nationals as possible. s e ei b pi* ^ j -a Ul s , ^ i u - 1 L/h L the -ui. x. anp ^3 objection goes deeper and that he is trying tp^rid himself as far as possible of interference/by H.M.G. If that is the case the Political Resident’s suggestion will not satisfy the Sultan and it ys suggested that it might suffice if the wording of pne Bahrein Agreement is used , viz.:- 'As many of the employees of the Company in Muscat as is consisrent with the efficient carrying on of the undertaking shall at all times be subjects of the Sultan or British subjsets.' If this suggestion /s accepted we might, perhaps, have a private understanding with the Company that they would in fact consult H.M.G. in remand to the employment of f c I'lLio aU+x*XJ Ih a** fu. fU* ^ lilfAAtXJ IZA^tA .

Department. in all matters without reference to the Agency or any other British representative. The Political Pesident comments as follows:- 'From our point of view the chief use of the local relations between the Ruler and the Company being conducted through the Political Agent is that we know what is going on. As far as these relations concern the implementing of the Commercial Agreement that is presumably a matter between the gultan and the Company. In so far as these relations concern the implementing of the Political Agreement they concern H.M.G. but I do not think that there is any practical danger of collusion between the Sultan ^nd the Company for the evasion of the terms of the Political Agreement and if there were such collusion this would come out sooner or 1 '’ter and the lack of previous knowledge on our part would not reduce their liability. Furthermore in regard to any important discussions between the Sultan r=nd the Company we can, I think, rely on the latter to keep us sufficiently informed. I am of opinion, therefore, that if the Sultan is obdurate this clause can be omitted'. There seems no need to question the Political Resident’s r~ opini on # qjwU we Might ucuepL—trhc suggestion anri~mrrg7r(T~T v He par n pr r m ph f nr thwi t h . In the nature of things the Company will inevitably consult H.M.G. on any major matter affecting their relations with the Sultan, while as regards local affairs it should not be difficult to arrange that the Chief Local Representative maintains close contact with the local Political Agent. Articl e 7. His Highness objects to the inclusion of the words (in line 6 and line 13) 'or His Majesty’s Government' as giving the latter certain rights in his territory which would amount to an encroachment on his sovereign rights. The Political Resident comments as follows:- 'The present right of H.M.G. to any areas for defence and the other purposes mentioned in this clause derives from separate Agreements with the* Sultan, e.g. the Civil Air Agreement. If H.M.G. require further areas in the future these can only be acquired from the Sultan by similar «474b Wt 22530/P 144 10,000 9.37 IOP agreement /agreement. This being so I do not think, therefore, that the words M or His Majesty’s Government” strengthen our position materially, ^nd I think that , in the last resort they might be omitted”. The position is as stated by the Resident but it would seem advisable to safeguard existing areas leased to H.M.G^, or their Agents, e.g. the N^val rest base at Khor Q,wai , the R.A.F. landing grounds and the Cable &amp; Wireless station maintained by Cable Sc Wireless Ltd. The Article might be re-drafted as follows:- 'Notwithstanding anything contained in the Agreement between the Company and the Sultan the Company shall not have the right to use or occupy and shall not include in the areas to be acquired or utilised for the purpose of its operations the surface of any sites which may have been selected by or on behalf of the Sultan or any sites which have been leased to H.M.G. or their Agents for del'ence purposes for^aerodromes, aeroplane or seaplane bases or for wireless or telegraph installations or in connection with the development of harbours provided that with the consent of the Sultan A the Company shall have the right to use for the purposes of its operations such harbours, aerodromes or seaplane bases as may be developed by the Sultan or His Majesty’s Government if there is not reasonable accommodation available elsewhere. Subject to the terms of the Agreement between the Company and the Sultan harbours developed by the Company shall be under its complete and exclusive control.” f this re-draft is regarded as suitable it^wfll be necessary^to require the Sultan to give ap^hmdertaking to the effect tXat he will not gr^nt oe^^ission to the Company to u^e, hqccupy etc.^^any sites leased to H.M.G. for aerodromes, etc\, jyifthout the prior consent of H.M .G.

He stated that his concurrence as to whether a stpte of national emergency or war existed should be required and in any case he objected to the right under those circumstances of H.M.G. to pre-emption all oil produced in hi =5 territory. The Politi cal Resident considers that thi&lt;= clause is essential ^nd should be insisted on and he thinks that the Sultan will 6 ILm.

As stated in an earlier part of this note the Admiralty attach particular importance to this provision and in some way the Sultan must be made tc agree. Article 1C. His Highness objects to the following words: - ’’In order th^t the Sultan may be in a position to fulfil his responsibilities for the protection of the Company”. The Sultan stated that he accepted no responsibility for any of the personnel of the Company when working in his territory, or for that matter any person, Muscati or foreigr^, and that he has laid down this condition clearly in Article 12 of the Commercial Agreement. As the Political Resident points out, the Sultan is of course wrong on this point. Under Article 17 of the concession he has definitely accepted responsibility for giving the Company 'all the protection in his power'. The Resident suggests that this should be explained to the Sultan and that it should be pointed out to him that the opening words of clause 1C strengthen clause 12 of the concession in his favour in regard to his 'prior pernission'. _ . . , &gt;WA. it is submitted, however, that this paragraph i* in, really^unnecessary *nd for thi=* reason.

That bein^ so it is unnecessary for us to include a similar provision in the proposed Political Agreement. For is it really necessary to say anything about arbitration since it is open to the Company (under Art.25 of the Commercial Agreement) to refer to the appointed arbitrators in any case in which they feel that the free movement of its personnel, within the concession area, is being unnecessarily restricted.

Z. 285/34. IFMEDI/T!3. P Z. ^86 Z-?^. : INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W.l. 13th January, 1934. Sir, In connection with the questions of granting an oil concession in Q,atr to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company acting on behalf of the Iraq Petroleum Company, and in Koweit to a company to be equally controlled by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and by the Gulf Company of the U.S.A., I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to ^tate that he has had under consideration one of the conditions to be laid down as a political safeguard in the case of either concession, namely, that the local personnel operating the concession should be either exclusively, or so far as possible, British subjects or subjects of the Sheikh concerned. 2. Sir Samuel Hoare attaches the highest degree of importance to this condition for well-known reasons, which need not be fully recapitulated. In view of the primitive conditions obtaining in the Arab principalities of the Persian Gulf, the backward state o^ the administration, and the uncivilised character of the local and neighbouring populations, it is impossible to ignore the risk of unfortunate incidents or disturbances which might result from the introduction of any considerable number of American or other foreign personnel of the artisan type into Q^atr or Kov/eit. The danger of incidents would be much greater in the case of foreign than in the case of British personnel, as the former would be less amenable to the advice and instructions of the local British authorities, ^nd at the same time any such incident in which a foreign national suffered might give rise to internationel complications, as the foreign Power concerned The Under Secretary of State, foreign Office. would / .LhZZ—,— —t— —T.L, JL.. : — ' TLIwould naturally demand that His Majesty’s Government should either take steps to enforce reparation, or permit it to intervene itself on behalf of its nationals. 3. The Secretary of State therefore considers that every endeavour should be made to secure the agreement of any company seeking an oil concession in any of the Arab sheikhdoms to a condition, providing the fullest possible safeguard that the circumstances of a particular case may permit, in regard to the nationality of its local personnel. He does not suggest that it is necessary to impose a condition in identical terms in all cases, since circumstances may differ, and in some of the sheikhdoms the safeguard desired is of even more importance than in others. 4. It will be remembered that the America-n-controlled Bahrein Petroleum Company agreed to a condition that as many of its employees in Bahrein as is consistent with the efficient carrying on of the undertaking shall at all times be British subjects or subjects of the Sheikh of Bahrein. This clause does not altogether exclude the employment of American personnel, and in effect it is largely left to the Company to decide whether the employment of individua-1 Americans is necessary for 'the efficient carrying on of the undertaking', since this is largely a technical point on which it would be difficult to dispute the Company’s opinion 5. The Secretary of State agrees with the suggestion, which has been made in inter-departmental discussions, that the various political safeguards desired in connection with the grant of oil concessions by the Sheikhs of Qatr and Koweit should be embodied in agreements to be concluded between His Majesty’s Government and the companies concerned He also agrees that it is desirable not to insist on such conditions as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the new Anglo-American Company in Q.atr and Koweit respectively,would clearly be unable to accept. But the importance of the saf egusrd/V sa.fe^uard in regard to the nationality of local personnel is so great that he suggests, firstly, that we should aim at securing its embodiment in the Q,atr and Koweit agreements to the fullest extent that may be possible, and secondly, that our minimum requirement should be a clause following thrt agreed to by the Bahrein Petroleum Company slightly mod ified so as to provide that as many of the local employees of the Company as is consistent, in the .judgment of the Company with the efficient carrying on of the undertaking shall at all times be British subjects or subjects of the Sheikh. This, it is suggested, should be the absolute minimum but every effort would be made to induce the Ccmpanies to agree to the omission of the words 'in the judgment of the Company' as otherwise it might not be possible to question in any way the action of the Company in regard to the number of its foreign employees. 6 . Sir Samuel Hoare would be grateful for a very early repiy to this letter. As the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs is aware, the matter is urment since agreements between the Companies and the Sheikhs concerned ca.nnot be brought into force - and ought, perhaps, not to be finally concluded - pending the conclusion of parallel agreements between the Companies and His Majesty’s Government. 7 • c °Py oC this letter is being sent to the Admiralty and the Petroleum Department.

Loch His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, Bahrein. India Office, 15th January 1934.- 2 - Sultan's eyes if 'subjects of tne Sultan' were put first and 'Britisn subjects 1 ' second# (to) Tne sultan's oDjections mignt toe got over cy substituting 'experts' for 'persons'. It could also oe explained to tne Sultan tnat tne otoj ect of tnis clause is to ensure tnat tne Company employs as few foreign nationals as possible. 5# .,i a.ior Watts * parser a pn 4 # jTom our poinu xa - view tne cdief use of tne local relations between tne Haler and tne company being conducted tnrougn tne roiitical Agent is tnat we Know wnat is going on. As far as tnese relations concern tne implementing of tne Commercial Agreement tnat is presumably a matter between tne Sultan and tne Company. In so far as tnese relations concern tne implementing of tne political Agreement, tney concern nis Majesty’s Government. But I do not tninK tnat tnere is any practical danger of collusion between tne Sultan and tne Company for tne evasion of tne terms of tne Political Agreement, and if tnere were sucn collusion tnis would come out sooner or later, ana tne lac*c of previous Knowledge on our part would not reduce tneir liability, purtnermore, in regara to arjy important aiscussions between tne sult&amp;n and tne company» we can, i tixinK, rei-y oii tne latter to Keep us sufficiently informed. 1 am of opinion, tnerefore, tnat if tne Sultan is obdurate tnis clause can be omitted. 6 « major Watts’ par agrapn o . Tne present rignt of His majesty’s Government to any areas for defence and tne otner purposes mentionea in tnis clause derives from separate agreements witn tne Sultan, e.g. tne Civil Air Agreement.If nis Majesty's Government require lurtner areas in tne future, these can only oe acquired iroxu tne bultaxi cy similar agreement, i'nis Oeing so 1 do not tninK tnereiure tnat tne words 'or His Majesty's Government' strengtnen our position materially, and I tninic tnat in tne last resort tney mignt oe omitted. 7. Major yatts* paragrapn 6 . Tnis clause, in my opinion, is essential and it snould oe insisted oii. 1 tnimc, nowever, tnat tne Sultan will agree if an explanation is given to nim on tne following lines. ■fnat it is immaterial to tne Sultan wno purchases tne oil i.e. nis Majesty's Goverxiinent or any otner customer as in any case ne will receive nis royalty. 1 ‘nat txie wnole tenour of tne schedule attached to txie pre-emption clause is in tne direction of increasing oil supply and in consequence tne royalties wnicn will accrue to tne Sultan. The Sultan may prove difficult over clause (b) of tne Scnedule out nere again it could oe explained to nim tnat tne ooject is to ensure and increase txxe supply of oil, witn consequexit benefit to nim. b. Major Watts' paragrapn 7. (a) Tne Sultan is of course quite wrong on tnis point, as Major Watts' pointed out to nim, under Article 17 of tne concession ne nas defixiitely accepted responsibility for giving tne Company 'all tne protection in nis power'. Tnis could again be explained to tne Sultan, and it could oe pointed out to nim txiat tne opening words of clause 10 strengtnens clause 12 of tixe concession in nis favour in regard to nis 'prior permission'.(b) Tne Sultan aid not apparently taice up witn Major Watts tne second point contained in tn4s clause, wnich ne inignt well nave done, as to tne relerence tor decision to tne Political Resident. Since tnis would seem to affect nis sovereign rignts to a greater extent tnan any ne will raise tnis point in London. Prom our point of view I tninic tnis provis© snould oe omittea. It tne Sultan declares tnat a certain area is unsafe, 1 do not see now tne Resident could possiOly taxe tne responsi di lity of maxing a decision to tne contrary. It is true tnat tnis proviso does occur in clause 10 of tne rrucial Coast political .Agreements out conditions in tnat area are quite different from tnose prevailing in unseat. Any dispute between tne Sultan and tne Company on tnis point snould be dealt witn by arbitration under Article 26 oi tne conces sion. Tnis part of clause 10 would tnen reads *»Tne sultan snail not unreasonably witnnoia sucn permission, and in any case in wnicn tne Company feels tnat tne free movement of its personnel witnin tne concession area is being unnecessarily restricted tne matter snail oe referred to arbitration under Article 26 of tne concession'. 9. Major iVatts 1 par agrapn S . Tnis is in tne nature of a general saf eguard. It is possible, nowever, tnat if nis Majesty* s Government are prepared to concede tne points I nave suggested above, e.g. in my paragrapns 6 and n ib), an exsmination or tne concession and tne political Agreement will snow tnat no inconsistency or conflict is lixely to arise. In tnis case clause 3 of tne latter mignt be omitted /- 0 - m omitt ed. 10* To sum up. X expect that tne Sultan on tne eve ol' nis departure on nis world tour, and douotless oein&amp; busy witn nis travel preparations, was not in tne oest mood ror nis discussions witn Major tfatts, tnou^n that was tne only opportunity tne latter could seize* i daresay tnat in lionaon ne will prove more amenable. In any case tnere would appear to De a number oi‘ points wnicn we can concede to nim. me two points lively to prove most difricult are tnose of pre emption and protection dealt witn in my paragrapns 7 and 8 (a) above respectively. sd.

MFP—601 S&amp;P-(M-820)—23-7-36—300,000. z(ffiy I replied that bo far as I understand this point* since PBtroleum Concessions Limited was a British Company who proposed to operate in a foreign territory* the question of looking after their interests and thetas welfare of their personnel generally was a responsibility which devolved on His ajesty*s Government in the same way as that of all British subjects dwelling in muscat limits was their concern* The Sultan said nothing further on this point but was clearlj not satisfied with the explanation given* 3* The Sultan took exception to the second half of paragraph 3 of the Draft Agreement* He declared that as worded it would enable either His Majesty's Government or the Company to get rid of all the kuscati or neighbouring Arab State subjects employed by the Company under Article 16(b) of the Commercial Agreement on the grounds that their labour was inefficient* 1 replied that Article 16(b) of the Commercial Agreement to which he had already given consent also laid down that if the Company found that the local labour was inadequate or unsuitable they should have the right to import labour* 1 added that the object and meaning of this clause in the Draft Political Agreement v»as perx'ectly clear to me* Oil prospecting and oil boring operations were* Z explained* a highly technical business of which all the specialised experts in the numerous branches thereof were not usually to be found in any one nation* It might well be found necessary to obtain the services of certain individuals who were neither British nor Muscat! * The Bultan however persisted in his objection./ &gt; 4• Reference paragraph 4 of Draft Political Agreement* Txie Multan said he failed to see why hie Government should not deal with the Company direct in all matters without reference to the Agency or any other British Representative* He declared that at present he and his officials dealt direct with British subjects when they had any business with them* I pointed out that this procedure &lt;ms only observed in routine or unimportant matters which as expressly provided for in the Draft Agreement could also be conducted direct by the Muscat Dtate authorities and the Company* The effect of this Article I said would be merely to bring the conduct of the Company*s affaire in line with what has been the procedure in the past for all dealings between British firms and subjects and the Muscat Government* * The Gultan was unable to refute this argument but obstinately persisted in his objection to the proviso in the Agreement* 5* Reference paragraph 7* The ouitan objected to the inclusion of the words {in iine 6 and line 15) 'or Hla Majesty’s Government' as giving the latter certain rights in his 'territory which would amount to an encroachment on his Sovereign rights* 1 replied that there was no question of any such encroachment of the Sultan’s rights being Intended and obviously before His Majesty’s Government proposed to acquire the use of any area of ground in Muscat territory for any of the purposes named they would, as in the past, obtain the Sultan’s consent beforehand* Reference paragraph 9* The Sultan objected to the tfiole of this paragraph* He said that his concurrence as to whether a state of national emergency or war existed should be required and in any case he objected to the right under those v.-irtancfcs of His Majesty’s Government to pre-emption of all oil produced in his country* As—4~ As regards tne lirat j^&amp;rx of tne Sultan 1 a objection 1 aaiced hiy whether he consiaered he was capable of judging the exact position of the relations wnich might arise between Great Britain and some .Foreign lower and whether it would amount to a national, emergency or state of war* The Sultan admitted he would not be able to Judge* Concerning ^re-emption 1 ^ointea out that under the terms of the Agreement entered into between him and the Company all the oil found in the State belonged to the latter and wnat was done with it was tne Company*s concern* The Sultan had no answer to this argument but refused to agree to the Article* 7* deference paragraph 10* The Sultan became very excited when he read the words * In order that the Sultan may oe in a position to fulfill his responsibilities for the protection of the Company* He accepted, he deciared# no responsibility for any of the personnel of the company »hen working in hie territory or for that matter any person isuscati or foreigner and had laid do*m this condition clearly in Clause 12 of the Commercial Agreement* l promptly produced a copy of tne Cormierclal agreement and snowed tne Buxtan the Article to which he referred and also Article 1? in which I explained that as X understood the question his responsibilities were more or less defined.

In accordance with instructions contained in your telegram No.1033 of 27th October 1937, I gave the aultan in Bombay a copy of the Draft Political Agreement together with copies of the letters drafts of which numbered 1 and 3 respectively were enclosed in India Office letter No.P.Z.4683/37 dated August 7 1937 and modified in India Office telegram No.5098 of 27th October 1937. I 3. The Jultan*3 reaction was startingly hostile. After giving a hasty glance at the letters he became very excited and declared that it would be quite impossible to go through all the numerous questions arising out of the draft agreement in the short time left before his departure from India. I then asked hii whether he would have liked me to have taken up this matter with him at Delhi while he was there or during the two weeks prior to his departure from Muscat when we were occupied in negotiations over the new treaty. The Sultan agreed that neither of these times would have been suitable for consideration of this question. I pointed out that there were four complete days left before the date of his departure from Bombay and that this would give more than sufficient time if he would peruse the two letters and the draft quietly with me he would find them both short and perfectly easy to understand.4. The Sultan by this tine was nearly in tears exclaiming that his subjects would have small respect for him if he decided such an important question in four days. I pointed out that he had completed the whole of the Oil Agreement with Petroleum Concessions Ltd. in 9 days and this was far more complicated, difficult and longer than the Political Agreement between the Company and His Majesty’s Government to which he was now being asked merely to give his concurrence. The Sultan replied that whereas the Agreement with the Company was merely one concerning money the Political Agreement involved matters affecting his control over his state. 5. After some further discussion 1 persuaded the Sultan with difficulty to read the Draft Agreement with me. The first point he raised was to ask what was the H TJnderstanding' referred to in paragraph 1 of my letter ( Draft Ho. I vide paragraph 1 above). I replied that I thought it was clear that this understanding referred to the communication I had made verbally to him at the time when negotiations for the oil concessions were being carried out in Muscat in JUne of this year that any concession to Petroleum Concessions Ltd. would be subject to a political Agreement to be concluded between the Company and His Majesty’s Government. The Gultan excitedly exclaimed that all he understood me to say at that time was that there would be a Political Agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Company but not that the Commercial Agreement would depend for its approval upon it. I replied that I remembered very clearly what I had said which was that I had reminded him of what I had already mentionedon a previous occasion at Dhofar that any agreement entered into between the Suit cm and Petroleum Concessions Ltd* would have to be approved of by Hie Majesty’s Government who would make a separate Political Agreement with the Company* I added that I had mentioned this matter on a second occasion during the negotiations at Muscat when Mr. Lermitte the Representative of the Company was present and that I felt certain that the latter would support my statement* The Sultan persisted in maintaining that he had understood my remarks in quite a different sense* 6* This is not the first time that the Sultan’s memory and understanding has become conveniently defective. IXiring his recent visit to Delhi he informed me that at an interview with H.3. the Viceroy, the Poreign Secretary Sir Aubrey Metcalfe had informed him definitely that the Arms Traffic Subsidy would be restored if the Sultan made a written official request for it* When I asked the Foreign Secretary the following day whether the Sultan’s statement was correct he entirely repudiated it and explained what he actually had said which was quite a different matter. (In this connection please see my express letter Ho.T/92 dated Kovember 26. 1937. ) In my opinion there is no question of the Sultan having so completely misunderstood the sense of what I told him in Muscat regarding the Political Agreement. He was anxious at the time not to raise any obstacle which might result in delaying the advance payment of the money coming to him under the terms of the Commercial Agreement and readily accepted Triiat I explained to him quite clearly of the necessity of obtaining His Majesty’s Government’s• appr^Yfed of tkat agreement. 7* The Bui tan after I had calmed him do%n a little, asked what was the object of having thiy Political Agreement sHiim him at all. He would have, he eaid, no objection to any sort of agreement which Kio Majesty »b Government might deal re to enter into with the Company so long as it would not adversely affect his interests. 1 pointed out that his query was exactly answered in paragraph 5 of the letter given him (Draft letter Ho. I) and all other matt ex's on which His Majesty'* Government desired their interests to be safeguarded wore fully explained and set forth in the various articles of the Agreement itself. The Gultan then exclaimed that he could not understand the Agreement, so I asked to tell me whnt points in it were puzzling him and'I would endeavour to clear thdci up. ’Ve then read over a portion of the Agreement the Jultan raising numerous objections to the various matters dealt with in the different articles. I do not propose ; unless you so deoire / to give now in detail his objections since I found that during the discussions we had on the subject on three successive days what the Buitan completely acquiesced in one day ho violently objected to the next and vice versa and in his reply which he has promised | send from Singapore to my letters mentioned in ( paragraph 2 above he will quits probably have altered his idea*ones more and raise different objections. Then his letter is received which should b&lt; shortly as he said he would despatch it by Air Hail before his departure from Singapore on December 14th, I can then, when forwai’ding it to you, comment if necessary on the various points he may raise with &amp;(/i4) Wqjte • view to elucld&amp;tfeng where poeeiW the reaeons for hie ol)Jectlono thereto. 8 .

As mentioned by you in your recent despatch giving an appreciation of his character the dultan is not always as ready to cooperate with as he is to ask for assistance and privileges from His Majesty’s Oovornment* r 9. The Sultan aeked me whether it would he possible f for him when in aiglend to call at the India Office and discuss this matter of the Political Agreement* I ByU* that time, he said, he would have been able to think over things and clarify his ideas on the * subject. I replied that I did not think there would be any objection to his doing so but that I should have - of course to refer the matter to you*— Minute Paper v A We have recently received an enquiry on 'behalf of a group representing British and American interests in regard to Gwadur. P. C. L. are not interested in this area. political Department. MUSCAT OIL. In 1923 (see page 319 Vol.XI Aitchison’s Treaties) the then Sultan of Muscat gave an undertaking that he would not exploit any petroleum which may he found anywhere within his territories and would not grant permission for its exploitation without consulting the Political Agent at Muscat and without the approval of the High Government of India. 2. It was decided at P.Z.1254/36 (Flag A in Coll.30/ 110(2)) to allow Petroleum Concessions Ltd. to open negotiations with the Sultan on the understanding that any concession will he subject to H.M.G.* s approval and would he accompanied hy the usual 'political” agreement between the Company and H.M.G. 3. After some delay (due mainly to the absence of the Sultan from his capital) the Company was successful in obtaining two concessions from the Sultan, one in respect of the Province of Dhofar and the other in regard to the whole of Muscat territories excluding Dhofar and the oversea enclave of Gwadur. Copies of the two concessions will be found immediately below. The concessions are modelled on the common form which has been adopted by the Company for Arabia oil concessions and do not differ in any material respect which affects Government from the draft Muscat concession originally submitted by the Company in March 1936, when they secured H.M.G. *8 approval to the opening of negotiations. 4. The concessions have actually been signed without any concurrent reservation in writing to the effect that they are subject to the approval of H.M.G., but it is understood that the Sultan was informed orally of the necessity for a political agreement between H.M.G. and the/ 7178 Wt 8900/111 10,000 4.382 Company and an Exchange of Notes between H.M.G., the i Sultan and the Company. The Company themselves are of course aware of this necessity (cf. at flag C, P.Z. 4683/37, the Company's letter of 16th July 1937). 5. The terms of the proposed political agreement have been accepted by the Company, and with the concurrence of the Foreign Office it is now proposed on the recommendation of Sir Trenchard Fowle to postpone signature until the Sultan's concurrence in the drafts and in the proposed Exchange of Notes has been obtained Sgd.

Dear Syinon, t We have been considering the points raised in your letter PZ 6286/37 of the 27th September to me in regard to the draft Muscat Political Agreement. These have been submitted to Sir William Malkin. 2. With reference to paragraph 3 of your letter, he does not much like the proposal to omit the words 'and approved by the Political Resident in the Persian 'Gulf'. He feels that if they are omitted the effect would be, at any rate in theory, that the Company might be subject to regulations made by the Sultan which had not been made applicable to British subjects by King’s Regulation. It would be possible, as previously pointed out by Beckett, to omit the article altogether, but if this is not done he would prefer the sentence to read ' 'made by the Sultan which are binding on British subjects. 1 ' His Highness could hardly object to that. 3 . With reference to paragraphs 4 and 7 of your jG i u?3 letter we agree. A.C.B.Symon Esq. 4 ./4. As regards paragraph 5 we concur generally but think that as we are, necessarily perhaps in the case of the Sultan of Muscat, substituting the principle of ’’consultation with” for ’’approval of” it might be as well so to v/ord the letters as to ensure that the Sultan will consult us at all stages i.e. before concluding as well as before entering into negotiations. This however seems to be a matter which could be left to the Political Resident. 5. One other point remains arising out of Longrigg’s letter of the 27th September to Glauson a copy of which you sent us in your PZ 6410/37 of the 1st October, viz. the reinstatement of Article 11 in the Political Agreement. On this point we adhere to the views expressed in Beckett’s minute of the 9th December, 1936. The company do not explain why they want to retain Article II nor do they answer the reasons given in Beckett’s minute for suggesting the Article should go out. It is difficult therefore to appreciate what underlies their request for the maintenance of a redundancy which really upsets the scheme on which the agreement and connected/“——-7 / 'HONE : NATIONAL 3S82 TELEGRAMS : INLAND^pfrCONCESS.

We have consulted Sir Trenchard Fowle regarding the next step and in his view it would be advisable to postpone signing the Political Agreements until we have obtained the Sultan’s concurrency in ( the Drafts in the proposed Exchange of Notes. But before doing this we should be glad to know v/hether the Foreign Office concur in the minor amendments which are dealt with in the enclosed telegraphic correspondence. 3. As regards the proposed amendment to 6 of the Political Agreements, you will probably remember that when noting on the Debai Political Agreement Beckett expressed the view that this Article was really unnecessary. In * such circumstances we think that Caroe’s point might be met by omitting the words ’’and approved by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf”. A King’s ♦ Regulation has already been issued applying the Sultan’s Air Navigation 5973 5000 3.372 . Regulations to all persons covered by the Muscat Order-in-Council and they thus become automatically bindin g on the Company. We do not think it is necessary to consult the Company regarding this amendment t^buir the omission will be brought to their notice when the final draft is sent to them for signature. 4. As regards Draft 2 , it is difficult to see what other form of words will achieve the desired object but we think that the risk of the Sultan objecting might be lessened if the relevant sentence of Draft 2 v/as omitted | carded and a new paragraph S^to Draft 1 on the lines suggested in our telegram to Bushire of the 4th September, addo4.- 5. As regards Drafts 3 and 4, we think that as under Article 27 of the Agreement with the Company only ’’consultation” is necessary^ 'Jt £&amp; will suffice if the Sultan is required to ’’consult” His Majesty’s Government in regard to the Bank. 6 . The Company are not affected by those suggested amendments to the Exchange #&lt; of Notes and we do not propose to consult them in the matter. At a later stage we shall have to send them copies of the actual Notes ^-exchanged and if it is thought desirable we can then explain any differences. 7. There remains the amendment to C paragraph 10 of the Political AgreementsDraft Paper. n fc H** r Department, (f »z Vi which is dealt with in Foreign Office / letter of the 7th September. While we ourselves see no objection to this amendment we feel that it might not be &amp; acceptable to the Oompany^nd we are inclined, unless you see any objection, to try it on the Sultan in the first instance. Our main reason for taking this line off is that the Sultan may have other amendments to propose and we think that as the Company have approved the Draft Agreements in their present form it might be best to take f' */ one bite *£ the cherry in the event of cat min lininry^t- approach them again CTJ- ^-4 regarding the^Agreements. 8 .

With regard to the text of the draft political agreement^ Mr. Eden would suggest one minor amendment namely that, in paragraph 10, the words 'The Sultan shall 'not unreasonably withhold such permission, and' might be omitted. It seems to Mr. Eden that these words, which add nothing to the sense, are open to the possible criticism that His Majesty’s Government purport to be saying what the Ruler of Muscat (i.e. a third party) will do. The second sentence of paragraph 10 should, he suggests, begin 'In any case in which....' 3. Copies of this letter are being, sent to the Admiralty, Air Ministry and Petroleum Department.

I shall be able to let you know definitely immediately after the September Board Meeting. The word 'Concession', occurring in the first line of paragraph 7 of the Draft Political Agreement, seems to be a slip for 'Agreement'. Yours sincerely. M.J.

Beer Warner, You spoke to oe auout the Draft i ichaiige of Notes enclosed with our official letter of the 6th Attiju.t Ko.i.2.4683/37 on the subject of tho tuscat Oil concessions. You were suxious to be mtrm that the points raised by heckett in his note oi %l* 9th December 1936 (; .7709/260/91) have been dealt with* The answer is that they have. The relevant points wore three in number. First, fleckett suggested that the arrange, ente whereby cueikh's right of termination ana the arbitration machinery under the Comaercial Concession is extended to apply to the Political Agreement should be accepted by the Company in one of two ways, either in tne political Agreei .eat itself (in which case Article 11 should be retained and expanded ) or in the Ixchaage of Notes (in which case Article 11 is superfluous;. We have *h*Warner aq., Foreign office.now omitted Artioie II (tus explained in my letter to arenan dated the 6th July i. 2 .4416/37, and have adopted Beckett'e eicond alte, native, making the neceastiry alteration in paragraph 3(b, oi the iiret draft letter to the Muler. fh* contents of this letter will he formally accepted by the Company in a concurrent ^change Of Botes between the* and us. X find that we did not enclose the draft fiotea to be exchanged with the Company in our official letter to you, but they will be the some muta-Us mutandis with the hotea exchanged with the Anglo- Persian Oil Company in June 193S in respect o: the liiatar Concession. I enclose a copy of the Atar print for ease of reference. Thus the sequence will be (1, Letter Lo.l to the huler, (*} letter Eo.2 from the Ruler, ( 3i Letter Mo.3 to the iuler, (4; Letter tio.4 from the Kuier, (5) though this might no doubt oe concurrent with (1) to (4), letter to the Company corresponding to the Letter of :let June to the A.i.O.C.

While the Trucial Coast negotiations were still proceeding. Petroleum Concessions Ltd. (the parent Company of the Trucial Coast Company) sent a representative to Muscat who (see the Resident’s telegram of the 3rd July - P.Z.4325/37) was successful in obtaining two concessions from the Sultan of Muscat, one in respect of the province of Dhofar and the other in regard to the whole of Muscat territories excluding Dhofar and the oversea enclave of Gwadur. We have received copies of these concessions from the Company. They are modelled on the common form which was adopted by the Company for Arabia oil concessions and do not differ in any material respect which affects Government from the draft Muscat concession originally submitted by the Company in March 1936, when they secured H*M*G. s approval to the opening of negotiations* 3. The Muscat concessions have actually been signed without any concurrent reservation in writing to the effect that they are subject to the approval of H.M.G, but it is understood that the Sultan was informed orally (jtwVM •to* Jfc* of the necessity for a political agreement and Exchange of Notes^ 'rrfl the , of course, realise this necessity. It is accordingly proposed to go through these usual formalities as soon as possible. The politcal agreement can follow the line of the Sharjah Political Agreement with minor adjustments. A copy of the Sharjah Agreement with the necessary amendments in red ink is attached. No progress is possible for tie moment as the aot.nnT /actual wording of a section of the pre-emption clause in the Sharjah Political Agreement is still under discussion between the Company, ourselves and the Admiralty, but it is to be hoped that this will, be settled very shortly. ^ aM ‘ UskTu&gt;Mi A&amp; Hi** *uU' AfZU* 4**^ 4.

Due to disagreement over the Sultan's obligations to British companies and the British Government when it comes to oil concessions, two political agreements were concluded: one involving the Sultan, PCL, and the British Government and in the form of an exchange of letters, the other between PCL and the British Government without the Sultan's knowledge.
