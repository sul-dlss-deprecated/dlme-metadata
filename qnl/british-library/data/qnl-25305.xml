After due consideration Sir Edward Grey is of opinion, and his opinion is shared by the Heads of the various other Departments concerned, that the agreement of Liarch 19th, 1914, has in the circum stances no longer any legal validity, and that they will decline to take this agreement into account when the moment comes to arrange for the future of the oil areas in these districts.

My Lords are prepared, in the circumstance^ to concur with the view of the Foreign Office, but I am to enquire whether Sir Edward Grey is of opinion that the repudiation of the agreement could be made without prejudice to any commercial rights to con cessions granted by the Turkish Government before _ the war. It is recognised that there is much uncertainty as to the nature and validity of these concessions and that if enforced on behalf of British subjects and in territory remaining under Turkish influence they would possibly also have to be recognised on behalf of foreigners and in territory coming under British influence. On the fcther hand the British preponderance in the Turkish Petroleum Company was secured on the strength of the concession held by the D’Arcy group, which His Majesty*s The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.Majesty’s Government always supported as a valid concession, and My Lords will be glad If Sir Edward Grey will consider how the rights of this group in Mesopotamia can be maintained If the agreement of March 1914 is repudiated. I am, etc., (Signed) W. Graham Greene.155286/15.

As regards the validity of the concession obtained by the d’Grey Group, I am to observe that, in so far as the rights of this group are based upon concessions granted before the agreement of i;arch 19th, 1914, they will be unaffected by the disappearance of that instrument. If these right* ' are assailed in any way it will be through the assumption by the Ottoman Government of a right to cancel the concession on account of the outbreak of the present war, - a course of action which the maintenance of the 1914 agreement viculd not affect in one way or the other. On the other hand it would be impossible to rely on the 1914 agreement to protect the right® of the d'Arcy group without ipso facto aci-nowlodging that it protects those oi the German group also.

In any further communication on the subject, please quote no. 123844/15. Foreign Office 8eptember_27th, 1915. OX I an directed ty secretary sir Edward Grey to acquaint you, for the infomation of Mr. secretary Chemberlain, that since the despatch of ray letter of the 13th of January last, relative to the rigits of the Turkish petroleum company under the Baghdad Railway concession, he has given careful consideration to the question of the attitude to he adopted by His Majesty*s Government towards the Agreement of March 19th, 1914, and the best means of safeguarding the British interests in the matters dealt with by that Agreement. Sir Edward Grey has caused further examination to be made of the documents bearing on this subject, and is advised that to recommend to the British interests con cerned that they diould take no steps to fulfil their obligations under the Agreement during the war would entail a responsibility on His Majesty* s Government which would only be justifiable on the assumption that the Agreement The under secretary of state, India Office.(123844/15) Agreement and the attendant arrangements have no longer any validity. Sir E. Grey is advised, however, that the effect of the war on the Agreement must either he to suspend It during the war or to dissolve It altogether, if the Agreement In Question was one concluded only between various commercial houses, the effect of the outbreak of war might have merely been to suspend its operation until the conclusion of peace, in the present instance, how ever, the arrangement was cane to, not only between the various commercial groups concerned, but also between His Majesty’s Government and the German Government. Moreover, the districts to which the Agreement relates are in enemy territory, which is now hostile, and have already, to a large extent, been occupied by His Majesty’s Forces. ^, in view of these circumstances sir Edward Grey cannot but feel that the Agreement of March 19th 1914, is legally no longer existent, and he considers that from political considerations it will be desirable to maintain this point of view, since it will clearly be advantageous to eliminate(123844/15) It - 0 eliminate German Interests iron regions vfcich in all probability will eventually fall witiiin a British sphere of influence. ^ He would propose, therefore, subject to the con- currence of those Departments of His Majesty’s Government which are also concerned, to announce without further delay that His Majesty’s Government regard the Agreement of 1914 as no longer having any validity whatsoever, and that they decline absolutely to take it into account when the time canes to arrange for the future of the oil areas | V in these districts. So far as sir Edward Grey is aware, the Ottoman Government had not actually granted any con cessions in consequence of this agreement at trie outbreak of the present war, and the situation is thereby, and to some extent, simplified. ^ in order to put the question on a satisfactory basis for the future, it would be desirable to deal with in the terras of peace, and, if Mr. secretary chamberlain is prepared to accept the considerations which have been advanced above, this point could be noted anong those subjects(123844/15) subjects which His Majesty 1 s Government intend to raise when negotiations for peace are eventually opened. ’ ^ Meanwhile sir Edward Grey would propose to infom the AngLo-persian Oil company that, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, the 1914 Agreement has no longer any validity and that it is therefore useless for any steps to be taken in accordance with its teims. sir Edward Grey would at the sane time infom the company that the whole question will have to be regulated on entirely different lines in the future. views in the matter. A similar letter has been addressed to the Board of Trade, Admiralty and Treasury. I am, Sir, Your most obedient, him hi p qp r'VM'n t. I am to request that sir Edward Grey may be favoured with an early expression of Mr. Chanberlain 1 sDate. Initials. SUBJECT.* • . MINUTE. The position appears to be this. The Ottoman Civil List held a concession of 'all known 'oil wells, as also those v/hich may be discovered” in the vilayets of Mosul and Bagdad - a concession transferred in 1908-9 to the Ministry of Finance. virtue of its existence^/the Bagdad Railway Coy. in 1903 were granted the right to work minerals within 20 kilometres on either side of the line; the Anatolian Railway Coy. entered into an agree ment with the Civil List for working certain mines in Mosul and Bagdad; and that Mr. D’Arcy’s negot iations were carried on. The Deutsche Bank acquired the^concessions, but transferred them to the Turkish Petroleum Co., ' • ^floated by the National Bank in October 1912, with a capital of £90,000^ in return for 2% participa tion. This Company also absorbed the interests of another claimant for concessions viz. the Anglo- Saxon Oil Co. (a product of the Shell). Finally the Company came to terms last year with Mr. D’Arcy and his group, the National Bank withdrawing from business, on the following basis: Mr. D’Arcy and group 50%, Deutsche Bank 2S%, Anglo-Saxon Co. 25%: the Chairman (with casting vote) to be for the first 10 years British, and the Vice Chairman German. A subsidiary Company was to hold the D’Arcy group’s shares, for which purpose the Burma Oil Co. was to find the capital (£100,000). The agreement ?/as made on 19th March 1914, and the necessary alterations were made in the original Company’s statutes, but owing to the delay of the D’Arcy group in taking up their shares, the transfer of interests had not been completed when war broke * out. 15616. I. 1178. 2000.—tt/1918.mmtfusmm L out. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company's letter of 2nd Nov. 1914 describes the position as it still is, and gives the arguments for and against proceeding to carry out the agreement of March 19th. The Company themselves are strongly in favour of proceeding, and the Admiralty support them (letter of 19th November). The Treasury on the other hand (see Company's letter of 11th Nov.) seem to have suggested that M the changed relations 'likely to result from the war might render it possible 'to secure the Mesopotamian concession for a purely 'British group'; and the Foreign Office now propose to say that 'the moment seems inopportune to proceed with 'this matter.' n'e have not been a party to the discussions, and are noo perfectly informed - there are obvious gaps in tne correspondence - and it is very inconvenient to be asked for an opinion at the eleventh hour. To the plain man it would seem that the Company and the Admiralty are right, and that the position at the end of the war will be very insecure if the Turkish Petroleum Co, - consisting (now that the National Bank has dropped out) of the Anglo-Saxon Co. and the Deutsche Bank - remains i sole possession of these valuable concessions. nIn any further communication on the subject, please quote no. 3884/15.

TK2 Ai-JGLC PERSIAN OIL CCi PANY P a ol* . / • ' i 4 a 24, OLD BROAD STREET. \ * LONDON, S.C. 2nd, November, 191/ Sir:- A With reference to the arrangements which were made in March last for a fusion of the Turkish Petrol eum interests of the D'Arcy Group M with those of the Turkish Petroleum Company I beg to draw the attention of His majesty's Government to the importance of these arrangements being carried through without delay in order that the interests of the D*Arcy Group (i.e. of tne Anglo-fsrsian Gil Company Limited) may be pre- served, no matter how the present war may eventuate, and also ^or the purpose of clearing up the present somewhat involved position as regards liability for expenditure already incurred, i The present position is as follows:- (1) Under the agreement signed at the Foreign Office on the 19th. Larch last the 'a'Arcy Group' are under obligation to take up uG,o of the Capital of the Turkish Petroleum Company. (2) For the purpose of carrying out this obli gation a Company was registered in June last under the name of the 'D'Arcy Exploration Company* with a Capital of *100,000 which Capital it is proposed should be subscribed for as follows:- Three- Under Secretary of state, Foreign office.ihree-lGurths by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited One-fourth ' o'Arcy tne latter being guaranteed by the /uiglo-Persian Oil Company in accordance with the arrangement discussed at a Conference held at the Admiralty on the 16th. June last. (a^j this Conference it was agreed, subject to the approval or the Treasury, that the whole of the Capital Siioulh oe subscribed for by the Burraah Oil Company Limited uuuer the guaraitee of the toglo-Persian oil oompc^*y .LL.Lifcc , the I^urmah Oil Company allowing Mr* -jhu'cy to participate in the subscription to the extent s,-i. one-lourtif* But the Governcaerit Directors hav f e since surgested that if the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited are to provide a guarantee there is no reason now that tne war has removed the reason which led to tii8 former arrangement, why the Anglo-Persian Oil Com pany Limited should, not itself subscribe for the shares in tne Pnxcy Exploration Company* In deference to this suggestion the Burmah Oil Company has agreed to cancel the former arrangement to cme extent of their 7b/o, out r, Dh^rcy still desires to retain his on the conditions then arrangedj and in view of the fact that the British claim to the ssopotamian Concession is solely based upon the nego tiations which Lr, D’Arcy has been carrying on for a number of years past it is felt that his claim to participation cannot be disregarded). (3) The shares in the O’Arcy Exploration Company have not yet been subscribed for, nor has the D’Arcy Exploration Company applied for its Chares in the TurkishTurkish Petroleum Company, or nominated its Directors. (4) in the meantime, pending confirmation by the Treasury of the proposed arrangements, various negotia tions were (prior to the outbreak of the war) carried on by myself and other proposed British Members of the Board oi the Turkish Petroleum Company, acting as Directors of the latter Company, in connexion with which expenditure to the extent of about £1,200 has been in curred by us for payments for options, geologists' fees, legal expenses, etc. in respect of our 50/o interest in tiie Turkish Petroleum Company* (0) Further expenditure of about £500 has been incurred in respect of Registration fees, legal expenses etc*, in connexion with the formation of the D'Arcy Ex ploration Company, The dangers connected with the present position are: (1) that as the Turkish Petroleum Company actual ly holds the kilonetric ‘ ining rights (so far as regards Petroleum) pertaining to the Baghdad Railway Concession we shall, if we fail now to complete the Agreement of the i^th, march 1914, lose all claim to am interest in these rights, inasmuch as v/hatever the result of the war may be the agreement in respect of these rights between the Baghdad Railway Company and the Turkish Petroleum Company will doubtless hold good inasmuch as it was con cluded long before the war with a Company of an osten sibly British character. As it was intended by the j aghdad Railway Company to select such an alignment for their Railways as would enable them under the kilometric Mining Concession to cover as far as practicable all the known Oilfields of Mesopotamia, a Petroleum Concession for the portion of Mesopotamiaprejudice our position should it later on be found prac ticable to secure the Concession of that portion of Mesopotamia not included in these rights for an all British group. 3y carrying out the agreement we shall secure con trol of the Turkish Petroleum Company, and be in a position to adopt whichever one of the following c may later on prove to be the most expedient. (a) wind up the Company if it be found yractic to secure both the Baghdad hailway rights and the esopotaraian Concession for an all British Group, and work the rights and Concession under the aegis of the D'Arcy Exploration Company. (b) carry it on for the purpose only of dealing with the Baghdad hallway rights, and let the B'nrcy Ex ploration Company deal with the Mesopotamian Concession. (c) carry it on entirely in pursuance of the original arrangement. Should course (a) be adopted we should not permit the calling up of any further Uorking Capital by the Turkish Petroleum Company and therefore the only finan cial obligation that would in such an event be incurre' by the Anglo-fersion Oil Company Limited would be a su - scription of, 1/-. per BhaUe on 75,000 Shares in the O’Arcy Exploration Company - S3 f 75C* and the guarantee of a suhscription of 1/-. per share by ..r, J’Arcy on 25,000 Shares in the same Company - 51,250 i.e. a total of £5,000* But as it is probable that the whole of the Capital called up would not be expended the total outlay involved may not be more than 53,000/3,500 in cluding about 51,700 already incurred as shown above. OutGut of the Capital of Go,OGC so provided to the O'Arcy exploration Company that Company would in its turn pay the call of 1/-. per share due to the Turkish Petroleum Company on the 66,000 Shares to be taken up by the D'Arcy Exploration Company in the latter Company - and have a balance in hand of 01,700 out of which to pay the Registration Fees, legal expenses etc. referred to on page and meet any other expenses. (This figure of 66,000 shares is arrived at by deducting from the 6c,COt shares to be held by the D'Arcy Ex ploration Company 10,000 shares which are to be issued as fully paid, and 4,000 shares to be paid by I.r. Gulbenkxan). With this explanation cf the position, and of the vital reasons which exist for protecting our f esopotam- ian interests, before then 1 trust that Mis ; ajesty's Government may see their way to authorising the carry ing through of the arrangements involved under the Agreement of the 19th.

Slade called at this Office on the 22nd instant to say that the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury had finally decided that they could not improve the arrangement which had been provisionally agreed upon with the various parties interested for guaranteeing the Burma Oil Company against the risk of loss owing to their financing the D’Arcy Syndicate in respect to the Mesopotamian oil concession. The matter having been further discussed between the Treasury and the Admiralty, it had been agreed that a much better and less complicated arrangement was to let the Anglo-Persian Company in the ordinary course of business make a loan for general purposes to Mr. D’Arcy. Such a transaction would not necessarily appear in any published document or statement, but even if it became known, would be no more open to objection than the originally proposed guarantee, from the point of view of an indirect connection between the Turkish Petroleum Company and the Anglo-Persian Company. On the other hand the former proposal for a guarantee was always thought to be faulty from the purely business point of view, as it involved His Majesty’s Government in liabilities for losses but gave no share in profits, and on this ground the Treasury had come to the conclusion that it could not be defended before Parliament. Admiral Slade explained that it was necessary to come to a decision at once, as the position of the company was getting an impossible one so long as this point was not settled. There was to be an early meeting, and the Admiralty wished to be in a position to say that from the Foreign Office point of view the new proposal was npt open to objection. The matter was fully discussed with Admiral Slade who was informed that any objection this Department might have to the new proposal was really applicable equally to the old, which had been accepted by the Foreign Office, and therefore it did not appear that objection could properly be urged against the arrangement now proposed.

(3&lt;i914) On torch 19th. last an Agreement was signed at the Foreign Office with reference to the Turkish Petroleum Concessions and the Turkish Petroleum Company. It was provided in this Agreement that certain changes should be made in the Articles of Association of the Turkish Petroleum Company, that the shares in the Turkish Petroleum Company held by the National Bank of Turkey should be transferred in equal moieties to the Deutsche Bank and the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company, and that new shares should be allotted to the d*Arcy Croup. The necessary alterations in the Articles of Association were completed on the 22nd April: but al though four months have now passed since the date of the Agreement, it has not been possible to carry out the alterations in the shareholding of the Turkish Petroleum Company, because the d'Arcy Croup have not yet u ^der Secretary of State \ Foreign Office.yet indicated to whom the shares assigned to them should he allotted. I am informed, hy a representative ol the Group, that their difficulty in giving this indication arises from negotiations with the Foreign Office which are still in progress. The present situation presents obvious and serious inconveniences, and, on behalf of the Directors repre- ^enuing tne National Bank of Turkey, I beg leave to call your attention to the desirability of bringing it to an end as soon as possible. Unless the.allotment of shares to the d'Arcy Group can be effected in the near future, the best course appears to be that the shares held by the National Bank of Turkey should be at once transferred to the Deutsche Bank and the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company, and that the Directors representing the National Bank of Turkey should resign their posts. The allotment of shares to the d*Arcy Group, and the nomination of their Directors, could take place subse quently. In the meantime, it appears preferable that the interim administration of the Company should be in the hands of parties who will continue to have a share inin it, rather than in the hands of those who are no longer concerned with its affairs. As ten days* notice are required for a Board Meeting, and as the holidays are approaching, I should esteem it a favour if I could be informed, at an early date, whether Sir Edward Grey sees any objection to the proposed procedure.

It is difficult to understand why so simple a question as amount of Turkish participation should form subject of discussion for two and a half months. Ottoman Government presumably realise that by thus protracting negotiation they indefinitely delay signature of our Monopolies Agreement, and, as the German Government are making their assent both to customs increase and to monopolies dependent upon settlement of Mesopotamian oil question, it is obvious that the effect upon Turkish revenues will be considerable, involving much more in amount than any possible Turkish share in the oil concession.

It may be necessary for Turkish Petroleum Company to constitute a subsidiary Ottoman company to work Mesopotamian concession, but, as you say in your telegram No. 393 of 30th June, these matters should be conducted by Company’s representatives. Question of presence of Turkish director, though there may be means of providing for this is not a minor point, in view of protracted negotiations between the several parties respecting distribution of shares and representation on the board, which preceded the agreement reached in London on 19th March last. It might have the effect of depriving the British element of control, and, though question must be settled by the Company with the Ottoman Government, I hesitate to abandon lever of monopolies agreement until it has been settled. At the same time I have no wish or intention to convey any threat to the Grand Vizier. As to payment of indemnity to third parties, the Company have always appreciated that they would have^ to compensate in some form or other (probably in the same way as the Anglo-Persian Company did m Persia) the local inhabitants who have derived profit from the wells in the past. As to other claimants, such as Ihose indicated in the second paragraph of your Excellency s telegram No. 405^ if the Ministry of Finance would furnish a list oft hem and the Ottoman Government would give an assurance that the list was complete and that they considered other claimants, who plead under the Mining Law, were without any vahd title, it might be possible to induce Turkish Petroleum _ Company to indemnify the Ottoman Government. But what Company particularly object to is an unlimited liability, which has been rendered still more formidable by the decision of the Council of State on 4th June (a decision which, according to Silley merely confirmed one given two years before), and by the unfortunate indiscretion by which it has become generally kn ° V As to Silley, whilst I am mindful of the arguments contained in Foreign Office letter of 20th May to his solicitors, an answer must now be sent to the reply which that letter evoked' and I should therefore be glad to receive a detailed reply to the last paraerauh of my telegram No. 292 of 2nd July, and to learn what is the exact position of th?Council of State.

They apparently consider it inconsistent with [? extreme] pressure [? recently] put upon them to grant the concession. I told Crawford that condition that company must indemnify claimants seemed inconsistent with grant of lease, and that, as Government admitted that concession existed, there could be no other legal claimants. Crawford agreed, and will advise Government to undertake responsibility themselves, but, as Hakki has communicated to them your apprehensions regarding Silley, to whose claims they did not previously attach importance, it may be more difficult to obtain a satisfactory answer. *Sir L. Mallet to Sir Edward Grey .—{Received July 3, 6-30 p.m.) Constantinople, July 3, 1914. (July 3, 6 p.m.) (No. 405.) R. YOUR telegram No. 292 Company could in any case be called upon to constitute itself as Societe anonyme ottomane, and tins cannot be disputed. In view of extent of enterprise, I consider that presence of Turkish director on the board might be mutually advantageous, but it is in any case a minor point. In anticipation of difficulties in this connection, I have already drawn up, in conjunction with my German colleague, formula of reply in the sense of my telegram No. 393 , adding that, in view of arguments therein expressed, possibility of having to indemnify any third persons seems to me to be excluded, unless there should be interested parties with whom Ministry qua concessionnaire had entered into any special engagements, which engagements could in the circumstances only have a temporary character. This addition is to cover any claim in respect of local lease of oil wells for short periods, some of which company might allow to expire normally. It is possible that company will in the end have to [group undecypherable : ? grant] some indemnity, but this is a matter for after-negotiation in my opinion, and in that of Whittall and Stock, with whom I discussed this question yesterday. Copy of this note goes to you by post this afternoon. Grand Vizier has referred in conversation to some decision of Council of State declaring original firman granting concession illegal, but his official reply to identic notes of German Ambassador and myself asking for lease states that Ministry of Finance, finding itself substituted for Civil List in respect of oilfields, grants lease to company. No mention is made of any decision of Council of State, precise effect of which it is difficult to estimate, but it may be presumed that Ministry do not attach much importance to it in view of terms of their reply. This gives one good ground for regarding Council as an advisory body. It would of course be impolitic to consult Turkish authority on the subject. In any case position of His Majesty’s Government up to date of this decision is unassailable, because until that time the validity of the firman was never for a moment disputed. I would, moreover, refer you to your letter to Silley’s lawyers enclosed in your despatch No. 321 of 21st May, in which they were told that Silley, in any case, has no claims. The memorandum enclosed in my despatch No. 354 clearly shows weakness of Silley’s case. Whittall anticipates that negotiations between company and Government will take a long time, and that great patience will be needed to bring them to a successful conclusion. If you desire to retain lever of monopolies agreement, it will not be possible to sign it for some weeks or even months. I would strongly deprecate conveying any more threats to the Grand Viziei at present.mrnmmsm CON KIULONTIaL. &lt;~ y x \3 Sir L.

My telegram No. 406 of 5th July. As Bin Saud is to be Vali of Nejd or Mutessarif of province, applications for “permis de recherche” should now properly be addressed to him. It seems probable that Silley is getting into touch with him, and it would therefore be advisable for Bin Saud to be in possession of His Majesty’s Government’s view, with regard to mining in his province, without delay. The moment he is appointed Turkish Vali, it will presumably be correct to address applications to him, but it would perhaps be advisable, in view of Turkish susceptibilities, to do so with caution and, if possible, through natives. The wisdom of introducing Turkish Petroleum Company, in which Germans have a large direct and indirect participation, into Arab provinces, has no doubt been fully considered by His Majesty’s Government in the light of policy hitherto followed of excluding introduction of foreign interests on Gulf coast and in Arabia, where Bin Saud is at present dominant. Appearance of Turkish Petroleum Company in these regions would afford German Government as good grounds as His Majesty’s Government for desiring to appoint consular agents in Nejd, which would enable them to intrigue with Arabs. 705 112]CONFIDENTIAL Sir Edward, Grey to Sir L.

My German colleague, in acknowledging announcement of proposed lease, will point out that basis on which lease was granted excludes in its possibility existence of claims of third parties. We wish, however, to avoid an argument with Porte, and I think that negotiations for contract should be begun as soon as possible. They will naturally be carried on by company’s representatives.

Our refusal to accept this had made a most disagreeable impression. Every other railway in Turkey had some Ottoman directors, including all the new French lines. English company was alone in refusing without giving any reasons. Turkish Government were unable to make a special exception in the case of this company. It was a question of amour-propi'e upon which they could not give way. I argued at length, but to no avail. I should have thought that this was a small point which company should be made to yield. As to oil, he went over all the old ground, but finally said that if we and Germany would support them in resisting similar demands by France and Russia for Syria and and eastern vilayets it would facilitate solution. I said that it would be useless to ask you for such an assurance. He may possibly prefer some form of words admitting that the case of Mesopotamia is exceptional, and recognising that the mining law is applicable in other parts of the Empire. I discussed the whole question of our relations with Turkey, and incidentally alluded to large concessions given to other countries in comparison with us. He denied this, and said that France was giving them more than the Porte had any right to hope [? group omitted: for]. In addition to the immense loan which had saved their lives, French capitalists were investing over 25 millions in railways which Turkey wished to see built. On all these lines there were two or three Ottoman directors. The French Government had treated with them in a most liberal spirit. His Majesty’s Government are, on the other hand, asking for feeder lines for riverain navigation, and hold out no prospect of construction of those [? lines]. If I could give him a list of [? lines] which English capitalists would put money into in the course of a year or two, he would give them at once. He asked for nothing better than British assistance, which was, however, not forthcoming. His Majesty’s Government merely wished to earmark certain districts in which no one else was to build railways, and of what good was that to Turkey ? As for 3 per cent., he affected to make light of threat to withdraw it, -which would affect the Debt much more than the Porte ; but this indifference is in part assumed, as I know from other sources that the Government are much concerned. The Grand ^ izier said that the fact of the threat having been made had rendered his position much more difficult, as he had been working for the conclusion of all the agreements, but that the Porte could not possibly give way to a threat of this kind. My German colleague is convinced that we shall certainly obtain what we want with a little patience. I told him that you must have everything settled before 1st July. He thinks that answer will be favourable to-morrow, but, if not, he will put in another note threatening to refuse monopolies, should I wish [? group omitted] it. In view of inclusion of oil question in 3 per cent, ultimatum, of which he is not aware, I have not thought it necessary to carry out that part of your instructions. As an immediate solution of pending questions does not seem to be probable, we must contemplate refusal of 3 per cent, after 1st July. I suppose that merchants should pay under protest. If so I should like early instructions, as consuls must be instructed as soon as possible.

Mallet to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received June 2.) (No. 379.) Sir, Constantinople, May 27, 1914. SINCE the presentation to the Grand Vizier by my German colleague and myself of the revised demand for the lease of the Mesopotamian oil concession to the Turkish Petroleum Company I have twice spoken to the Grand Vizier with a view to hastening a decision. On the 23rd instant his Highness said that our new proposal did not help them at all, because if they made the company the sole lessee of the Government it would amount to a monopoly and bring upon them similar demands from other Powers, which it was their object to avoid. I told his Highness that there was no use in disguising the fact that the company was asking for a monopoly which had been promised to His Majesty’s Government and to the German Government if we could come to terms. We had come to terms, and were asking fqr the fulfilment of this promise. The company would not be content with anything less. If they adopted the means which we had proposed they would have a perfectly sound argument to use to applicants for a monopoly in other provinces. Whereas if they maintained that all operations in these provinces must be undertaken in accordance with the mining law, and then proceeded under that law to give practically all the fields to the company, whom nothing else would satisfy, they would lay themselves open to claims cn the part of earlier applicants for “permis de recherches,” which had been refused, and involve themselves in hopeless incon sistencies, without escaping from the difficulties which they contemplated would arise with other Powers. I suggested that Mr. Weakley should go to the Ministry and explain the facts to those who were studying the question, an offer which his Highness said that he would be glad to accept when a preliminary investigation had been held. I asked his Highness again yesterday what progress had been made, and reminded him that he had not yet sent for Mr. Weakley. He replied that the question was still under consideration. I said that I sincerely hoped that it would be settled before the 25th June, at which he exclaimed that it would be settled in a week. It will be seen from the enclosed memorandum by Mr. Weakley that the Govern ment are evidently unable to make up their minds how to proceed. In the long run I think that they would be compelled to accept the fact and recognise the existence of the concession, but it may yet take some argument to convince them of this necessity. It may be observed that a firman cannot be illegal, and as the two existing firmans can only be cancelled by the issue of another firman this would only prove the validity of the previous firman and strengthen our present contention. I have, &amp;c. LOUIS MALLET. Enclosure in No. .1. Memorandum by Mr. Weakley re Civil List Firmans. THE Council of State has been called upon by the Porte to convene a general meeting of the Council in order to deliberate and to give a decision vith legald to 1. Whether the tenour of the two firmans which conferred the concession for prospecting and working the oilfields found in the vilayets of Bagdad and Alosui on tne Civit List must be respected ; 2.

The official is understood to have pointed out that the two firmans have been respected so far and have debarred the Department from issuing permits in the two provinces. He was asked whether any “permis” had really been issued, to which he replied that only three had been granted, and explained that these had been issued during the first year of Constitution, when affairs in general were not in a normal condition, but that legally they would have to be cancelled. He further explained that these firmans would have to be respected unless they were, of course, cancelled by the issue of another firman. The Council came to no decision on Monday, and the question was a^ain examined yesterday, but with what result I have not yet been able to ascertain.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Governn^t. 1 TURKEY.

I gathered from your telegram that they are not conditions, but I did not take up this point, and confined myself to pointin' on that clause respecting Shatt-el-Arab irrigation was proposed quite as much i Ottoman interest as m British, the commission being Ottoman. As for railway line, in view of number of lines which had been given to others we were asking for very little. Moreover, construction of “ feeders ” to the river was as important to Ottoman Government as to ourselves, as they were partners in riverain concessions. I he other request was conditional on lines ever being granted. Your wish was to clean the slate and remove all possibilities of further friction. His Highness said that Ilakki Pasha had already received instructions, but I appealed to him to use his influence to obtain these modifications. He finally said that he would consider question and see what could be done in the way of finding a formula. His Highness told me that German negotiations had begun well.

As the Germans make their assent to the 15 per cent, contingent inter aha upon grant of the Mesopotamian concession, the whole negotiations are interdependent.

Foreign Office, June 6, 1914, 3’15 p.m. HAKK1 PASHA has given me unfavourable replies about (i) the additional clause concerning irrigation works which might affect navigation on Shatt-el-Arab, (ii) short feeder railways, (iii) Arabian lines south of latitude 31, and (iv) he has no satisfactory information about Mesopotamian oil question, though I have impressed upon him my earnest wish to conclude all negotiations by 1st July at the latest. As to (i) the Ottoman Government appear to admit that navigation shall not be interfered with on Shatt-el-Arab by irrigation works, and I have been given no reason to explain their reluctance to embody this admission in an agreement in the wording 1 have proposed to which I attach importance. The clause I have suggested can do no possible harm to Ottoman interests, as the Commission itself is to be an Ottoman institution. As to (ii) and (iii) I am a little surprised that His Majesty’s Government should meet with a refusal in regard to such a moderate request, when Turkey has given such extensive concessions for railways to French and German groups. The complaint has frequently been made by Turkey that Pritish capital avoids that country as a field of investment; the present attitude of the Turkish Government, in refusing even an option for short feeders to an Ottoman company in which British subjects are interested, is perhaps the true answer to the above complaint. Our wish is to facilitate the economic development of Turkey, and to avoid the total exclusion of British enterprise from the regions where concessions have not yet been gi\en to others. . Hakki Pasha says that our requests are regarded at Constantinople as fresh conditions of our assent to the customs increase and monopolies^, this is a mis apprehension. Point (iv) has been a condition from the first, l oint (i) we regaid as essential to the harmonious and successful working of the Commission, and we have proposed it in the interests of Turkey as much as in those of international commerce. Point (ii) will be very important to the Navigation Company when irrigation is developed and the local traffic may become some substitute for the diversion of through traffic to the Bagdad Railway. I cannot understand why the Ottoman Government objects to giving the option desired.

[May 20.] Section 4. [22639] No. 1. Board of Trade to Foreign Office.—(Received May 20.) (Secret.) Sir, Board of Trade, May 20, 1914. WITH reference to your letter of the 13th May transmitting copy of a letter to the Admiralty with respect to the relations between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Turkish Petroleum Company, I am directed by the Board of Trade to state that they have now been in communication on the subject with representatives of the former company, and to offer the following observations for Sir E. Greys consideration. The arrangement described in the Admiralty letter of the 6th May as a method of providing the capital for the holding company which would represent the D’Arcy interests in the Turkish Petroleum Company, appears to the Board to be in effect not a loan to individuals, but a subscription by the Anglo-Persian Company for shares in the Turkish Petroleum Company, and therefore to make His Majesty’s Government in effect shareholders in that Company, but without full control over its operations. However desirable such a participation (even though subject to the reservation mentioned) may be from the standpoint of Admiralty policy, the Board have felt compelled, in view of your letter above referred to, to assume that it is inadmissible. The commercial reasons adduced by the representatives of the Anglo-Persian Company in favour of the arrangement proposed are that the primary object of the D’Arcy group in their efforts to secure control of the Mesopotamian concession was to protect the Anglo-Persian Company’s main enterprise—a purpose fully recognised by His Majesty’s Government; that although the arrangements as to Government participation in that enterprise will, if carried through, place the company in a much stronger position than formerly, such a measure of protection is still desirable ; and that the formation of a holding company, entirely independent of the Anglo-Persian Company (even if practicable) would not afford the desired protection, since the shareholders therein could not be restrained from disposing of their shares to British subjects who might enter into competition with the Anglo-Persian Company. There appears to the Board to be considerable force in these arguments, and if it be necessary to reject the arrangement outlined in the Admiralty letter above referred to, for giving the Anglo-Persian Company control of the holding company and thereby of the Turkish Petroleum Company, it becomes necessary to endeavour to secure that the holding company shall at least be constituted by some group having a permanent interest in the Anglo-Persian Company. As a result of the discussions which have taken place with representatives of the Anglo-Persian Company it has been suggested that the best solution would be for the capital of the holding company to be advanced by the Burmah Oil Company (which will be the sole holder, other than His Majesty’s Government, of ordinary shares in the Anglo-Persian Company), and for the shares to be held by, or in trust for, the Burmah Company. It is understood, however, that the Burmah Oil Company would not be disposed to enter into such an arrangement unless they received from the Anglo-Persian Company a guarantee against resultant loss, such guarantee to be limited to the amount of capital subscribed by the Burmah Oil Company, which would not exceed 100,000L It is further understood that there would be no difficulty in securing that the Burmah Oil Company would remain permanently British. The possibility from a financial point of view ol the proposed guarantee being given by the Anglo-Persian Company is a matter for the decision of the Admiralty and Treasury, but should they not be averse therefrom the Board are disposed to suggest, for Sir E. Grey’s consideration, that the scheme now outlined is not open to the objections taken to the original scheme in your letter to the Admiralty ot the 13th May. ^ It is true that under it His Majesty’s Government would have an indirect financial interest m the Mesopotamian concession, but it would be very limited in scope and of a negative character. His Majesty’s Government would have no^ voice or share in the .working of the concession, and no participation in any profits arising therefrom. [2136 u—F\Further, it is understood that the D’Arcy group would acquiesce in the election as chairman of’the Turkish Petroleum Company of some person not a director of the Anglo-Persian Company. It appears to the Board, however, in all the circumstances, impracticable and inadvisable to endeavour to stipulate that none of the directors of the Anglo-Persian Company shall be also directors of the Turkish Petroleum Company. The practical result of such a stipulation would probably be that the British directory of the Turkish Petroleum Company would be quite unable to hold their own as regard^ technical acquaintance with oil production with the able representatives of the Anglo- Saxon Company and the Deutsche Bank.

Sir E. Grey now gathers that this view is not fully shared by the Lords commissioners of the Admiralty, but he trusts nevertheless that it may be possible to devise other means than those suggested for ensuring that the Turkish Petroleum v-ompany shall remain, as regards at least 50 per cent, of its voting capital, British. A proposal indeed has been tentatively and informally put before this Department by the Board of Trade to the effect that the necessary capital should be furnished by the , lu ’™ a Company. If satisfactory arrangements can be made for securing that ne Burma Oil Company does not change its nationality, or that the control of its affairs does not pass into ioreign hands, this proposal would seem to meet the requirements dt the situation. It would not be objectionable from the point of view of foreign Policy, as the Bjirma.Oil Company will no longer have a controlling interest in the [2136 VD i £2 MAY 1914/ 2 Anglo-Persian Oil Company when the proposed agreement with His Majesty’s Govern ment is concluded.

(Apr-a 24, 8 p.m.) YOUR telegram No. [? 209] As D’Arcy’s application and our support were based on the argument that the German contract was annulled—a position which we and the Turkish Government have consistently upheld for years past—we should completely stultify ourselves by suggesting or recommending course favoured by the Deutsche Bank, and it might even be dangerous to do so. The German Embassy are constantly referring to their rights under this contract of 1904, but I have always replied by reminding them that His Majesty’s Government and the Porte consider that the 1904 contract has lapsed and that the promise to D’Arcy holds the held. In any case the concession to the Turkish Petroleum Company could not be based on the German contract and on the promise to D’Arcy as Greenway recommends. It must be remembered that the concession was originally given to the Civil List, who contracted to work it with the Germans in [? 1904]. This contract was, however, annulled in two notes from the Civil List in 190/. It was then promised to D Arcy. In 1908 the concession, which still existed as such, was transferred to the Ministry of Finance, who own it to-day, so that the natural procedure would be to transfer it bodily to the Turkish Petroleum Company. This would be a fair compromise for the Deutsche Bank to accept, if the Turkish proposal be found impracticable. 1 did, indeed, suggest it to the Grand Vizier, but he argued that the concession had been illegal throughout, and that, in order to avoid complications with other countries, they must work according to the Mining Law. If, however, they really work under the Mining Law, they cannot legally avoid revival of old “ permis de recherche such as Tahsin Pasha’s, in which Muriettas were interested ; nor can they refuse Grand \ izier s “ permis ” to other applicants. I have pointed this out to the Grand V izier more than once, and his answers have not been altogether satisfactoiy. . . . German Charge d’Affaires has, however, suggested that a secret undertaking should be given not to grant “permis ” to other companies, and in any case we have agreed to await the communication of a promised list of Government wells ™a&gt; move to be extensive. In the meantime I think it will be better not to commit ourselves to any particular course, nor will it be possible to [? push] the matter through in a great hurry.u In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote ^ IL? ^ and address— The Under-Secretary of iitate, Foreign Office, London 1 i I i 1 ^4 rhe Undersecretaryo, State for Foreign A fairs presents his compliments to the Undersecretary of State for and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith copU, 0 f under-mentioned Paper.

Admiralty to Foreign Office.—(Received May 7.) (Confidential.) Sir, Admiralty, May 6, 1914. WITH reference to the agreement of the 19th March, 1914, arranged in conference at the Foreign Office for the fusion of the interests in Turkish petroleum concessions of the D’Arcy group and the Turkish Petroleum Company, I am commanded b}’ my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to request that you will acquaint the Secretary of State that they have been verbally informed that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company intend to find the capital amounting to 100,000k for the holding company proposed to be registered to hold the D’Arcy group’s shares in the Turkish Petroleum Company. 2. If the proposal is finally approved by the directors of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company the decision will necessarily be taken, as the matter is an urgent one, before His Majesty’s Government subscribe for shares in that company and are represented on the Board of Directors, but it appears probable that except possibly the first instalment of Is. per share, the actual payments out of the funds of the company will be made subsequently to the Government becoming financially interested therein under the agreement which is now reaching its final stages. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company contemplate issuing the necessary funds by way of loan to some four persons—including two of the present directors of the company—on the understanding that the shares, together with blank transfers for the same, shall be lodged with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The amount of share capital to he taken in the Turkish Petroleum Company by the D’Arcy group under paragraph 3 of the agreement above referred to is 80,000k, but it is understood that further capital of about 20,000k is proposed to be provided for general working expenses of the holding company, and also to meet the contingency of a possible increase in the capital of the Turkish Petroleum Company. Four thousand of the shares, however, are to be subscribed for on behalf of M. Gulbenkian with financial interest only—those shares to remain registered in the name of the holding company. Ten thousand of the shares are proposed to be allotted fully paid. 3. Assuming that the arrangements indicated in paragraphs 5 to 7 of the agreement prove adequate for the subsequent raising by subsidiary companies fully controlled by the Turkish Petroleum Company of the necessary capital for the actual working of the concessions, and that the capital of the Turkish Petroleum Company will not be increased (if at all) to such an extent that the D Arcy proportion cannot be provided out of the 20,000k above referred to, it would appear that the sum advanced bv the Anglo-Persian Oil Company will be limited to 86,000k 4. As regards the financial risks which might be incurred by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, it appears to my Lords that this must be taken as part of the general risk of that company’s enterprise. The Deutsche Bank (and formerly the National Bank of Turkey), the Shell group, and the D’Arcy group, who possess between them considerable expert knowledge of oilfields in general and of the possibilities of the Mesopotamian concessions in particular, have all been extremely desirous of partici pating in the exploitation of those concessions. This may lie taken as fair evidence that the prospects of success are reasonably good. . 5. The important point arises whether the loan of funds by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, in which His Majesty’s Government are about to acquire rathei more than half the share capital, may present any difficulty from the foreign Office standpoint 6. The view which my Lords have always taken of the D Arcy claim to a shaie of the Mesopotamian oil concessions has been that not only was the claim deserving of the support of His Majesty’s Government on the ground that that group were pioneers m that particular field, but also that whether large supplies of oil from Mesopotamia may or may not eventually be required for naval purposes, the maintenance of B lltls control in the Mesopotamian field would be beneficial to the operations of the * ng o- Persian Oil Company, or conversely that foreign control in Mesopotamia mig it prove [2136 0—2] CCDV VO , * k A 2 MAY 1914/.o adverse to the interests of the Persian field. His Majesty’s Government by taking a direct share in the latter field must be held therefore to have an indirect interest in the manner in which oil produced in Mesopotamia may ultimately be marketed. &gt; ^' This mdnect inteiest will be somewhat strengthened if an arrangement is carried through which my Lords understand from the Board of Trade is proposed bi 1 ^ the Deutsche Bank group, viz., that over any exportable surplus of fuel oil which may be ultimately available from Mesopotamian fields, the German Government shall have an option of purchase up to one-third, and the British Government an option of the same nature and extent. 8. So far as naval interests are concerned, my Lords regard it as both unnecessary and undesirable that His Majesty s Government should be directly concerned in the exploitation of the Mesopotamian fields, and presumably if such direct intervention the German*(Mjver 1 ' lposs ’'^ e t0 res ' st an y claim to similar direct participation by 9. As three out of four, or possibly all four, of the directors who will represent the DArcy group m the Turkish Petroleum Company will be chosen from directors of t e Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and one of those directors is also proposed as the chairman of the Turkish I etroleum Company with a casting vote, the direct interest of the Anglo-l ersian Oil Company m the Turkish Petroleum Company will be a matter of public knowledge. My Lords are disposed to think, however, that a loan of very limited extent from the funds of the Anglo-Persiau Company, in which nearly a half interest will remain in private hands, to the British holding company in the Turkish ““T 4 b ?,, re f arded as a direct Participation in management by His Majesty s Government. The functions of the ex officio directors to be appointed to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company would not extend in this particular matter beyond seeing that the Government financial interests were protected in the same manner as in egaul to any other securities held by the company for loans of money, and the ex o&lt; ““s ”»' 10.

Parker of the Foreign Office to send you a copy of the enclosed statement which was prepared by us and revised by Mr. Parker, and which deals with the position of His Majesty’s Government in connection with oil concessions in Mesopotamia and of our client’s claims with regard to certain concessions. We should, perhaps, mention that the copy enclosed is in the form in which it was revised by Mr. Parker, and a copy has been sent out to our client, Mr. Silley, in Constantinople. YVe are &amp;c TREHERNE, HIGGINS, and Co. Enclosure in No. 1. Statement. BY the convention of the 5th March, 1903, made between Zihni Pasha, Minister of Public Works for the Ottoman Government, and certain gentlemen representing the Turkish Railway of Anatolia, known as the Convention of 1903, a concession for the Bagdad Railway was granted. Article 22 of this concession provides as follows : “ Le concessionnaire pourra exploiter les mines qu’il aura decouvertes dans une zone de 20 kilom. de chaque cote de 1’axe de la voie, en se conformant aux lois^et reglements y relatifs, et sans que cela constitue pour lui un privilege ou un monopole. It is doubtful what mining rights exactly were acquired by the Bagdad Railway under this article, but it is thought that although the Bagdad Railway did not acquire a monopoly in the mining rights over the areas concerned, they did at any rate acquire a very definite prior claim over a wide area. . ~ By an agreement made between the Anatolian Railway and the lurkish Govern ment (Civil List) in 1904, known as the Convention of 1904, the railway claims to have received a monopoly in respect of the mining rights over wide areas, including those concerned. This claim has, however, been held in some quarters to have lapsed Whatever mining rights were acquired under the conventions of 1903 and 1904 by the Bagdad Railway have been transferred to the Turkish Petroleum Company, in whose favour the British Government have asked for a concession in Mosul and Bagdad from the Turkish Government. , It may be confidentially stated that an agreement was come to on the 19th March 1914, arranging for the fusion of the interests of the D Arcy group and he Turkish Petroleum Company upon certain terms which dehne the t-nctalj^er t which the various parties concerned shall have in the Turkish Petroleum Company. The agreement does not, however, define what mm mg rig s ,, TO ud a nulled Company has or in what areas it is interested, but in 1905 the J ) 5‘ R L g a °7 B ?lld to the Turkish Government for a monopoly over ‘^ od areas of Mosu^ and were given definite undertakings and promises \ vosuc p g as the promises being confirmed to His Majesty’s Ambassador-and this g° u P “ a8 - “ beino first in the field, had ever since the diplomatic support of His Maj . &gt; .

Cocv to [ t» • r v } JULJ9UGovernment, and an agreement was prepared and is still under discussion with Hakki Pasha. This agreement does not aftect any questions in which Mr. Silley’s interests are concerned. It is stipulated that certain*British claims respecting the transfer of th “ permis de recherches ” for petroleum in the Farsan archipelago shall be respected Had Mr. Sdley approached His Majesty’s Government prior to July 1913 with reo-ard to his claim, it might have been possible for His Majesty’s Government to have inserted in their draft agreement with the Turkish Government stipulations as to Mr. Silley’s mining rights in the vilayets of Basra and Nejd, but it is too late to do so now, as His Majesty’s Government cannot possibly go back on the terms of the agreement which has been agreed, even although details of drafting are still under discussion. Generally speaking the policy of His Majesty’s Government is, so far as possible to use their influence to prevent oil concessions getting in the hands of groups or syndicates other than British. His Majesty’s Government have for several years urged the lurkish Government to give the concession in Mosul and Bagdad to Mr. D’Arcy. 1 hey cannot now support a claim against them in consequence of compliance with their His Majesty’s Government state that they cannot support Mr. Silley’s claims in respect of prospecting licences, options, and concessions in the provinces of Mosul and -Bagdad. Seeing that the Turkish Government have granted Mr. Silley the interests referred to in these provinces, it would appear, in the opinion of his London solicitors that he has some claim for compensation against the Turkish Government in consequence of the monopoly which they have now given to the Turkish Petroleum Company With regard to any such claims for compensation, the Foreign Office state that the c ance o ge ing any such claim for compensation admitted is extremely remote. As regards Mr. Silley’s rights in the vilayets of Basra and Nejd, His Majesty’s Government wdl be prepared to support him in respect of these claims, provided he gi es a written undertaking in the form required by His Majesty’s Embassy at Constantinople If an undertaking in the form requested is given His Majesty s Government will be prepared not only to support him but, in the event of his arranging to make over his rights to the Turkish Petroleum Company to use their influence o enable him to obtain fair and proper prices for them, P according to thefe proved value and, in the event of failure to obtain such prices, not opposf him in Ma^esty^Governmfnf 8 ^ ^sh-controlled companies P But His Majesty s Government can express no opinion as to the value of Mr. Silley’s claimsCONFIDENTIAL. v- \ T549 l—1 914 , Sir I^dicard Grey to Sir L.

Silley urges that his prospecting licences in regard to Mosul and Bagdad are fully in order, and that if Turkish Government disregards them he will claim compensation, and try to enlist our diplomatic support. It has been explained to solicitor that His Majesty’s Government have long been committed to support Mr. I) Arcy, who many years ago had been promised a monopoly m legard to Mosul and Bagdad ; that they have repeatedly pressed Ottoman Govern ment to fulfil this promise, and that they cannot now support a claim against Turkish Government for compensation owing to their having conceded to Mr. Silley prospecting licences which were ultra vires. It was further explained that His Majesty’s Government only became aivare of Mr. Silley s claims at a relatively recent date. As to Basra and Nejd, Mr. Silley urges that his claims should be supported by His Majesty’s Government in the same way as they are supporting claimants in Syria and Farsan, i.e., by making definite grant of a concession a condition of British assent to monopolies, Ac. It has been pointed out to solicitor that our conditions were formulated in July ; that we were then unaware of Mr. Silley’s claims; and that it is impracticable now to make further conditions; but that, if Mr. Silley gives the desired | undertaking in writing, we will support his claims in Basra and Nejd and, if they are valid, use our influence with Turkish Petroleum Company to secure equitable arrange ments ; if he cannot secure satisfactory terms from them he will, subject to above undertaking, be free to dispose of his rights elsewhere.

Memorandum by Mr. Ashley.—(Received at Foreign Office, March 18.) Mesopotamian Oil. IN accordance with Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith’s instruction, I have this morning had an interview with Dr. Bergmann, representing the Deutsche Bank. He was accompanied by Herr von Kuhlmann. Dr. Bergmann was acquainted with the outline of Sir Henry Babington-bmitn s latest proposal. He said that, whilst the Deutsche Bank would naturally prefer a deal with the British group, whereby each would have a 50 per cent, interest, they felt that it would be difficult for them to take such a course. In the first place, they are under certain definite obligations in connection with the lurkish Petroleum Company, and independent action by them might, and very probably would, give rise to litigation, which they were anxious to avoid. In the second place, there are business relations between the Deutsche Bank and the Anglo-Saxon Company m other fields, and the Deutsche Bank for that reason desire that the settlement reached should be as amicable as P 0 |® i 1 ^ eutsche Bank therefore do not object to a settlement on the basis now suggested by Sir Henry Babington-Smith, and Dr. Bergmann is of opinion that it offers a solution which should be satisfactory to the d’Arcy group. I said that I was not n a position to say what the decision of the d’Arcy group would be. but speaking only for myself, it seemed that there was a fair prospect of a settlement. R was suggested that ?f the d’Arcy group were favourably inclined to Sir Henry Babington-Smith s proposal, a metdng'of I the parties might be held, say, tc.mor^^at whicha record wouU give^th™ EHtSi^and 6 German 'Governments an adequate basis for action at Oonsta^ino^e,^and^the;for^l^d^etads^imile^t^e^su^seque^ ^ eariy next week.

Natioyial Bank n-f Turltvii .. will be satisfied if in addition to this 2^ per cent., he is given a sub-participation of ££ per cent, in the share of 50 per cent, which, in accordance with the wish of Mis Majesty s Government, would be assigned to Mr. d’Arcy’s group. The shares representing this 2J per cent, would stand, not in Mr. Gulbenkian’s name, but in the name of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, or whatever other name represents the d Arcy group, and the votes attaching to them would be exercised for all purposes by that group. Mr. Gulbenkian will sign any document that may be deemed necessary to remove any doubt on this point, and, further, he will enter into a binding engage ment that this interest should not be transferred to anyone else without first being offered on defined terms to the d’Arcy group. As an example of a method by which the price may be defined, I may refer to the article of the statutes of the Turkish Petroleum Company which deals with this point. This arrangement would secure to the d’Arcy group complete and permanent control of 50 per cent, of the share capital if, as I assume is the case, His Majesty’s Government have taken measures to ensure that the shares held by that group at the outset shall continue to be held by it permanently. Mr. Gulbenkian would have a financial interest, amounting to 5 per cent, in all, in the business, but he would have no voting rights of any kind. As regards the procedure to be followed, the shares in the Turkish Petroleum Company held in the name of the National Bank of Turkey (50 per cent, of the whole) might be transferred half to the Deutsche Bank and half to the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company, and then transferred afresh to the d’Arcy group. This was the procedure originally suggested by the Deutsche Bank. As an alternative, the shares might, with the concurrence of the Deutsche Bank and the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company, be transferred direct to the d’Arcy group. So far as the National Bank of Turkey is concerned, either procedure might be adopted. The question would arise whether the partnership thus to be established between the d’Arcy group, the Deutsche Bank, and the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company should apply to the whole of Turkey (as does the Turkish Petroleum Company) or should be limited to Mesopotamia, the region to which the attention of the d’Arcy group has been directed. But once the question of principle decided, this matter could be settled without difficulty between the parties concerned.
