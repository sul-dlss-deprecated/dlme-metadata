Muzdal’fah is a station of the hadj, where pilgrims camp gather on the 9th of
                           Dhul-Hijjah, as can be seen in this image.Here pilgrims pray, perform
                           wuquf(standing before God) and may collect stones for the stoning of the Jamarat at Mina (Muna). Left of centre, along the horizon, a lone white-washed structure, featuring a minaret, appears to be the only building on the plain. Just below the horizon, groups of people and trains of camels to the right and left of the image are visible. A group stands with their backs to the camera in the foreground. Either mist or over-exposure has rendered the horizon blurry. In the far distance ridges of hills are visible, however.The negative has had hand-work applied, creating a drawing-like quality, particularly in the background and around the three figures to the left in the foreground.Arabic script written directly into the image has been erased subtly, but is visible upon close inspection in the lower centre of the image as well as in the central sky area of the image.Inscriptions:Above image, on the right, in ink: ‘XII’Temporal Context:According to Durkje van der Wal in his publication
