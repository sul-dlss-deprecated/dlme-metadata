By far the largest number of these remittances have been forwarded by the Superintendent of the Bahrain State Police on behalf of police officers. However, other officials of the Government of Bahrain are also involved in forwarding remittances on behalf of their own staff; such as Charles Belgrave as Adviser to the Government and Commandant of the State Police, the Director of Customs, the State Engineer, and the Director of Education. Officers from the Royal Naval base and the Pilot Balloon Observatory are also involved, as are the private companies Gray, Mackenzie and Company Limited and the British Overseas Airways Corporation. They are addressed to either the Indian Assistant or the Political Agent.The Arabic language content consists of 31 folios of remittances, which are predominantly from departments of the Bahrain State such as: the Bahrain Court, Department of Minors Funds, the Manama Municipality, and the Police departments in both Manama [Al Manāmah] and Muharraq [Al Muḩarraq].</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Assistant's Court, Indian Assistant, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">recipient</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Superintendent of State Police, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000271#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000271#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000271#share">Creative Commons Attribution Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000271#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000271#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
