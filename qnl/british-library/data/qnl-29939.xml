The only local form of transport being donkeys, we ^ai: ed scrae three miles to Bilad as Gur where there are gardens with a plentiful supply of water and where the Gult&amp;n's Governor has his headquarters.

He there refers to it as a town of ?^eat political and eort^. ercfal importance and estimates the population at about lr,000 souls. The importance of the place has now cons! erably d^niniahed. The Gultan exercises effect ve control and p ace prevails. &lt;4th the increi se in steamer tra fic tlie trade of the place is no longer whet it vyec, but I wee informed that 5t still owns about 100 ocren»roiiu? country craft and t: at 50 of these left fer Aden and fcst Africe last eutuinn ca. : 'ryinr dates, ^hey are expected booh at the beginning of I ay with carrots of atagrovw poles and coffee. The population of Sur Itself ex cluding its suburbs is now estimated at about 6,000 Including about 900 I a2tie' is and 25 I Indus, the rest being mostly Arabs of the Janabeh end ? eni bu An tribes. They are sea-^ering folk ranging aion^ all the coasts of the In ian Cc* an and 1 found them Cf np&amp;rat: velyseph sttested end very polite. Supplies are adequate and I saw nc s’rns of distress, though as the dhow traffic and fishing are almost their only means of livelihood their existence amt be somewhat precarious. As yet none have migrated to s ek e plcyaent with the oil cotspsairs in the l ersian Gulf. As the bulk of the population spend a oart of the year in the date gardens at Belad as Gur U\ey suffer ’inch from malerir, 3.

The project proposed by h essrs.
