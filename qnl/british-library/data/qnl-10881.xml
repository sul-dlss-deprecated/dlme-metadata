In the foreground bushes can be seen and in the middle ground and background pilgrims are grouped together. A ridge of hills rises to the left and extends into the far distance on the right along the horizon.Tradition relates that she requested to be buried at this location, where she married Mohammed. A group of pilgrims form a circle to the right of the centre of the image.

The first is X463/7.Inscriptions:Above image, on the right, in ink: ‘VIII’Temporal Context:According to Durkje van der Wal in his publication
