Offers for the concession area are made by both companies and included in the volume, along with later discussion regarding the possibility of dividing the remaining concession area in two and granting separate concessions, one for the unalloted area on the mainland and the other for the Hawar Islands and other territorial islands. Copies of the draft agreement produced by Petroleum Concessions Limited, and later amendments can be found at folios 5-22, 91-107.Also discussed is the potential of over-lapping rights should a concession be granted for the unallotted area and suggestions that a concession for that area might contain a clause granting subordinate rights in some areas in order to respect rights granted to BAPCO in their agreement. The rights related to access to fresh water, roads and harbours.Further discussion surrounds the ‘Bahrain Islands’ focusing particularly on the Hawar group of islands and whether they were owned by Bahrain, as claimed by the Shaikh of Bahrain and could therefore be included in a concession for the unalloted area. The resulting enquiries made by the India Office concluded that it appeared Bahrain owned the islands, and that the burden of disproving ownership rested with any other potential claimant.A series of file notes which were maintained as a record of the correspondence in the volume can be found at folios 221-227.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Petroleum Company</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Petroleum Concessions Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Boundaries</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Bahrain</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000296#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000296#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000296#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
