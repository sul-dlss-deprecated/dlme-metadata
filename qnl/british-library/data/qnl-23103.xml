We now enclose two more copies of the enclosures to our letter No. W 2776/1801/802 of the 16th June. 3. Amendment No.l to Co-ordinating Committee Paper 48 (i) has now been published. We enclose three copies. 4. It is hoped to arrange for the implementation of facilities at Bahrain to be carried out by Cable and Wireless Limited, and International Air Radio. The two companies have agreed that Cable and Wireless 'should undertake the provision of point-to-point facilities while International Air Radio should operate air-to-ground channels, radio navigational aids and such other communic ations as form ^n integral part of the airport system at Bahrain. 5. Salalah and masirah are, as far as we know, maintained by the Royal air Force on a care and maintenance basis and are not 'joint-user' airfields. The principles outlined in Paper 48(1 do not therefore apply at these airfields. Yours ever, General Department. The Residency, Bahrain.Confidential R.31908A.7 ~ Co-ordinating Committee ( ^ 8 ) 1 . ' MINISTRY OF CIVIL AYIATIOH/AIR MINISTRY CO-ORDIHATIHG CCMilTTEE General Principles an d Practices to be followed at Joint-User Airfields Overseas INTRODUCTION 1 \ „ ThesG Principles and practices will apply equally to other stations overseas,^such as Air Traffic Control Centres, which it is decided to operate on a joint-user basis. . GUNKRAL RESPONSIBILITY 2 . Joint-user airfields overseas are those at which facilities are provided as of right on an agreed joint basis for both military and civil aircraft. The administration and organisation of such airfields will thus be the ' responsibility of the Air Officer Commanding concerned and of the local * Government in whose territory the airfield is situated. It will be necessary au each airfield for Air Officers Commanding to consult with local Governments in order to carry out the general policy which has been agreed. 3« The R.A.F. Commanding Officer will bear complete responsibility for the discipline and- administration of service personnel and, within the limits normally applicable on an R.A.F. station, of any Air Ministry civil staff and employees. The administration and discipline of civilian staff employed by or on behalf of the local Government concerned will be the responsibility of the local Government, An officer of the local Government concerned will be placed in charge of such civilian staff. 4* Notwithstanding the fpct that either the service or civilian interests on a particular airfield will always predominate, the R.A.F. Commanding Officer and the Senior Civil Ofiicerwill each deal with their own subordinates only, so 1 ar as disciplinary enquiries and disciplinary action are concerned, except that in any cases where both service and civilian interests may be affected, a general enquiry may be held by mutual agreement. The R.A.F. Commanding Officer and the Senior Civil Officer will each issue any day-to-day administrative instructions which may be required to their own subordinates. There will be no question of the direct subordination of the Senior Civil Officer to the R.A.F. Commanding Officer or vice versa but for operational convenience subordinate staff on duty may be placed in the charge of a Senior Officer either civil or R.A.F. 5. His Majesty’s Government are obliged, by international agreements, to provide facilities for the lawful passage of civil aircraft, both British and foreign, on the international trunk routes. Certain local air services, operated by local airlines will also use joint-user airfields. It is not possible for H.M.G. to deny the use of airfields open to international air traffic to international and local airlines (except in time of national emergency when ihe facilities may be denied to all operators, either completely or partially, on a non-discrininatoxy basis; action in emergency would only be taken on instructions from or with the specific approval of Departments in London), It yri.ll not therefore be open to an R.A.F. Commanding Officer at a joint-user airfield to issue orders precluding the use /of CIV# 16788,- 2 - of the airfield by civil operators, British or foreign. It will be the responsibility of the local Government to check the entitlement of civil operators* In the same way it will not be open to a local Government to prevent the passage of service aircraft in order to safeguard particular civil requirements* Clearance for the passage of foreign military aircraft will be co-ordinated by the Air Ministry. 6, In peace-time the R.A.F. have certain strategic obligations which can only be met by keeping open a certain defined route capacity, which may not be required in full except under threat of emergency, but which must be kept at all times available* It may therefore be necessary at joint-user airfields to formulate quotas for service and civil use. The service quota would take full account of strategic needs and the civil quota would be available for distribution among those civil operators who had been granted rights to operate to the airfield concerned. The quotas to be applied at each airfield would be a matter for separate discussion in each case and would be subject tc revision on account of any alteration by agreement in the balance of civil and strategic needs or of any physical alteration to the airfield which affected' its total capacity. FINANCE 1 , In order to avoid complicated and unnecessary accounting the formula for the division of cost between R,A*F, and civil accounts should be simple to -PPly even if this entails a certain .sacrifice in accuracy of apportionment. # Because of the difference between the. salaries, allowances conditions oi service, etc# of R*A*F. and civil staffs the cost of control and tcleconmunications staffs will be omitted from the pool account (see paragraph 1G below) ana an attempt will be made to obtain a fair division of cost by allocating the facilities to be provided by the R.A.F. and Civil Authorities respectively on a basis proportionate to service and civil re quire cents. 9. agreement will be reached from time to time on the capital expenditure or assets necessaiy to provide facilities for joint use, the ownership of which shall rest with one party. The owner of capital assets will then charge to the pool account a rental which will include amortisation of the capital value of the item over an agreed period of years. All equipment supplied ^ solely lor civil or R.n.F. use will be provided by the appropriate authority and no charge will be mudo to the pool accountj whore appropriate such equipment will be clearly marked. Fool Account 10. A pool account, normally maintained by the local Government, will be set up at each joint-user airfield to record actual expenditure and assess costs for the maintenance and operation of joint-user services other than expenditure on control and telecommunications staffs (see paragraph 8 above). These charges will be debited to the pool account and credited to the Department or Government that bears the expenditure in the first instance or is entitled to the rental. Capital works and other services used solely for civil or solely for R.A.F. purposes will be excluded. Landing fees and concession rentals on the civil site will also be excluded. /Division ..... CIV, 16788,-3- Division of Costs Vu * f ach ‘ P0 , 0 ^ account wil1 be adjusted after a period of six months from tne date on viiich the account is opened and thereafter annually. 1^* T ^ e P°ol^account will be in two parts, Part I of which will represent \ c of m 1 h! onance and rental of the runways and taxiv/ays and Part II of which will include all other expenditure or rentals appropriate to the pool account. Part 1 will be divided between the R.A.P. and Civil Authorities in the ratio of the total weights of the aircraft landing - the weight being taken as the certified all-up weight. Part II will be'divided m the ratio of the number of military to civil movements at the airfield, one movement of any military aircraft, except transport/communications aircraft based at the airfield, being taken as half a movement. This formula will be applied for a six month experimental period and thereafter if suitable. Should the formula prove unsatisfactory revised arrangements will be made. After the initial period of six months division of cost will take place annually. ADMINISTRATION Ownership 13» There will bu separate civil and R.A.P, sites each as self-contained as possible where the civil and service commitments respectively will be handled. 14* It is expected that the civil site will either be owned by the local GrOvernment concerned or held on long lease, e.g. 50 years, from the R.A.P. Landing Pees 15*^ Local Governments will normally be responsible for the collection of lancing foes and concession rentals. 16 . Until local Governments are in a position to take over the R.A.P. will continue to collect fees. ^ Porks Services and Maintenance 17* . hero there is no site owned or leased by the local Government, all works services in connection with the landing ground and buildings (doth R.A.P. and civil) will be the responsibility of A.M.. .D.. 10, Where works services are required by the local Government on a civil site owned or leased by them, the local Government concerned will be responsible' for arranging for the design and execution of the work. Responsibility for work on the landing ground, on the R.A.F. site and on any other area outside the Government-owned or leased civil site, will rest with A.M.W.D.* Pire fighting and Medical services 19. The measure of integration of fire fighting and medical services will depend upon local conditions; such arrangements should be settled locally. Petrol, Oil and Lubricants 20.

For example there might be a condition that the employee should be dismissed if an action in an English court established that he was negligent in discharging his duties; but there could not be a condition that the employer would not be liable to third parties for the torts of the employee. -rp* Liability as between the employing authority and the person suffering damage may be affected by any contract between them.

The- results of this trial will then be considered with a view to the establishment of agreed principles. TELECQIVMJNICATIQNS 46# Air movement radio circuits (point-to-qpoint, air/ground and landline circuits), navigation and landing aids and control facilities will be used jointly by R.A.F. and civil aircraft on common air routes# . . 47. On common air routes responsibility for the operation and maintenance of telecommunications facilities agreed to bo required for these routes will bo divided between R.A.F. and civil on an agreed ratio. 48.

As a broad principle common procedures will be *omplcyed on each common air route* 50* As far as possible joint-user radio and control facilities will employ I.C.A.O. standards and frequencies, 5*1. As a long-term policy adequate training in I.C.A.O. procedures will be included in the syllabuses of R.A.F. signals training schools. 52. A joint aeronautical communications traffic office will be required to deal v/ith aeronautical traffic as classified by I.C.A.O.. 53. It is hoped eventually that the aeronautical fixed telecommunications service will function as a separate organisation from other service and civil administrative and operational circuits, 54. Air/ground circuits at Air Traffic Control Centres will be civil manned. 55. Where the R.A.F. operate airfield and approach control they vdll as far as possible also operate and maintain the associated radio facilities and vice versa. 56* Where min point-to-point and air/ground channels are civil manned the traffic office will as far as possible also be civil manned and vice versa. 57* Appropriate arrangements will need to be made for the provision of any additional telecommunications staff required to meet any large and sustained increase in air movements that my arise. 1 58. During the initial period of build-up and development it will be necessary to review the joint plan as a whole from time to time. P.l. 2nd March, 1948.
