GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. ESTABLISHMENT. To The Most Hon’ble the MARQUIS of CREWE, K.G., His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Simla, the 19th September 1912. My Lord Marquis, In reply to Your Lordship’s despatch No. 48 (Political), dated the 10th May 1912, we have the honour to explain that, before authorising the provisional allotment of Rs. 6,740 per annum for the maintenance of the Koweit Agency launch, we caused enquiries to be made as to the circumstances which necessitated expenditure on this launch on a scale so much higher than that approved for the maintenance of the Consular launch at Mohammerah. 2. Our enquiries demonstrated that no comparison could safely he instituted, owing to the variation of prices obtaining in the different localities and to the dissimilarity of the work which these two launches are required to perform. The launch at Mohammerah, for instance, is a flat bottomed river launch stationed in fresh water and is only required for river trips, while that at Koweit is a sea-going vessel drawing 7 feet of water stationed in salt water and required to make comparatively long voyages. Eurther, as the Mohammerah launch, owing to her unsuitability and defects, has been very little used, there has been no opportunity to test the sufficiency or otherwise of the allotment sanctioned for her up-keep. 3. When the Koweit launch was first provided, the sum of Rs. 6,740 which was allotted for its maintenance was based on the following items : JRs. Coal and stores ... ... ••• 4,200 Repairs ... ••• ••• 2,300 Miscellaneous ... ••• ••• 240 At the time it was not contemplated that the vessel would be required to take up a regular mail service between Koweit and Lao, and, consequently, this estimate proved insufficient. As the launch ceased to perform this extra duty in May 1911, we proposed in our despatch No. 13 (Establishment), dated the 1st February 1912, to sanction expenditure at the rate originally provided, i.e. t Rs 6,740. Your Lordship will observe from the enclosure of our despatch, No. 99 (Secret), dated the 29th August 1912, on the subject of the reduction of expenditure in the Agencies and Consulates under the Bushire Residency, that we have now substituted a fixed contract grant of Rs. 12,000 for the previously existing allotments of Rs. 5,750 and Rs. 6,/40 on account of the establishment and up-keep of the Koweit Agency launch. /This allows for an expenditure approximately of Rs. 6,250 on the main tenance of the launch distributed as follows :— Us. Cost of coal, 120 tons, with handling ... ... 4,000 Cost of fresh water ... ..^ ... 250 Cost of ship’s stores and dockyard bills ... 1,600 Cost of miscellaneous petty repairs, cleaning ship, &amp;c. 400 In the circumstances the estimate appears to us reasonable and we trust that it may he approved. A further reduction will be made should the experience of a year’s normal working prove such a measure to be feasible. We have the honour to be, My Lord Marquis, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble servants, (jl1912. SIMLA. FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. ESTABLISHMENT. NO. 107, DATED THE 19TH SEPTEMBER 1912.

To The Most Honourable the MARQUIS of CREWE, K.G., His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Simla, the 29th August 1912. My Lord Marquis, In paragraph 4 of the Secret Despatch from Lord Minto’s Government No. 160, dated the 17th November 1910, Your Lordship was informed that Sir Percy Cox’s proposals for effecting a reduction of expenditure in the Agencies and Consulates under the Bushire Residency were under consideration, and that the economies resulting therefrom were estimated at Rs. 67,509 a year. 2. As Your Lordship is aware*, we deputed Mr. J. B. Wood, C.I.E., of our Political Department, to visit the Persian * Telegram from the Secretary of State, dated j n order to examine the question of the 19th February 1912. reduction of expenditure in these Consu lates and Agencies, and to report on the feasibility of introducing a system of office allowances somewhat on the lines of that obtaining in the Consulates under the London Foreign Office. 3. We now enclose, for Your Lordship’s information, a copy of the final orders which we have issued as a result of these Letter No. 2085-Est. A., dated the 6th July en q U i r i e s, together with a statement shewing 1Jl “' , their financial effect as compared with the sanctioned grants for the year 1910-11, which formed the basis of our original estimate. Your Lordship will observe that arrangements have been made to utilize the Bahrain launch to meet the requirements both of the Bahrain Agency and of the Bunder Abbas Consulate. Consequently the expenditure of Rs. 7,400 a year and Rs. 60,000 initial, which Your Lordship t Secretary of State's despatch, No. ioi Pol., sanc tionedf for the provision of a launch for dated the 4th September 1903. i xr the Bunder Abbas Consulate, will not be incurred. The total saving effected by these orders may, therefore, be taken to be Rs. 59,790+7,400= Rs. 67,190 a year. 4. We invite Your Lordship’s special attention to paragraphs 3 to 5 of the orders issued, which contain instructions regulating expenditure from the office2 allowance and fixing the status of present incumbents of pensionable appoint- ments who will, in future, be paid from the office allowance. 5. We trust that in the peculiar circumstances of the case the departure from the rules in the Civil Service Regulations and the Civil Account Code, which we ^ have sanctioned, will meet with Your Lordship’s approval. We have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient humble Servants, (Signed) HARDINGE or PENSHURST. „ O’M. CREAGH. „ R. !W. CARLYLE. „ SYED ALI IMAM. „ W. H. CLARK. „ R. H.

To Lieutenant-Colonel Sir PERCY COX, K.C.I.E., C.S.L, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Dated Simla, the 6th July 1912. Sir, ‘ I am directed to refer to your letter No. 2106, dated the 6th August 1910, regarding the reduction of expenditure in the Bushire Residency and subordinate offices. 2. I am, in the first place, to notice the following errors and omissions in the proposition and other statements accompanying your letter :— Muscat. {a) The sanctioned pay. of the 2nd clerk is Rs. 120 and not Rs. 125 as shown in the proposition statement. (b) The sanctioned grant for 1910-11 under the head “ Travelling allowance for Officers and Establishment ” is Rs. 1,250 and not Rs. 1.000 as shown in Statement B. (c) The sanctioned grant of Rs. 800 under the head “ Medical and Hospital Stores and Supplies ” has been omitted from Statement B. Koweit. The sanctioned pay of the Head Clerk is Rs. 120—5—150 and not Rs. 100—10—150 as shown in the proposition statement. 3. I am to inform you that the Government of India approve generally of the proposals for reduction of expenditure submitted by you. At the same time they recognise that in distant and isolated posts it is difficult, except at an exces sive cost, to maintain a clerical establishment capable of dealb g with accounts on the lines prescribed by the audit codes ; and they consider that economy should result from a suitable modification of the existing system of accounts. They ac cordingly propose to delegate to local officers increased powers in regard to details of expenditure and to relieve them of the obligation of referring for sanction to higher authority petty alterations in the Consulate or Agency charges, which it may from time to time be found expedient to adopt. In pursuance of this object the Government of India have now decided, subject to the approval of His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, and, on the analogy of the system prevailing in Consulates under the London Foreign Office, to place at the disposal of each Consul or Agent fixed annual allowances which will cover a large portion of the establishment and other charges hitherto met from separate fixed allotments. The details of the charges to be met from these contract grants will be left entirely to the discretion of each officer, who will be at liberty to vary the scale of charges from time to time without sanction of higher authority, subject only to the follow ing conditions:— (1) The annual grants must not be exceeded in any case, the Consul or Political Agent concerned being held personally responsible for any excess. (2) All establishment paid from the office allowance or other contract grants will be non-pensionable, but special arrangements will be made, 255 FDas explained in paragraph 4 below to, protect, in certain cases, the interests of officers now holding pensionable appointments under Government. % (3) No officer will have the power to bind his successor to the scale of charges adopted by him. (4) No officer will draw more than one-fourth of the annual contract al lowances, each quarter, without the specific orders of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. (5) Each officer will render an account of his expenditure from the contract allowances to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, in such form, and at such intervals, as the Resident may prescribe. The latter will inform the Camptroller, India Treasuries, of the amount passed by him, from time to time, as regards each office ; and the Comptroller, India Treasuries, will ask for no further accounts of disbursements from the contract grants, and w T ill content himself with seeing that the total grant is not exceeded. (6) The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf will have full powers of re- appropriation of surrendered savings on contract grants, but the grant of each Consul or Political Agent will be diminished by such sur rendered savings, and he will be personally liable for any excess over the contract grant so diminished. The Resident will inform the Comptroller, India Treasuries, of any such reappropriations. (7) Unexpended balances of contract grants will lapse at the end of each financial year. (8) Except as provided in paragraph 4 below the leave rules in the Civil Service Regulations will not be applicable to any members of the establishment paid from the contract grants, but they will be entitled to such leave and such allowance as the Consul or Political Agent concerned may decide to grant. (9) Sale proceeds of old furniture and other Government property will not in future be credited to Government in the ordinary manner, but will be added to the amount of the office allowance at the disposal of the Political Agent or Consul concerned. A separate account should, however, be maintained of all amounts realised from the sale of durbar presents and submitted annually for the information of the Govern ment of India. (10) The rules in Article 98 of the Civil Account Code, Volume I, as regards contingent charges, w ill not be appliable to any purchases made from the contract grants. (11) The cash in hand of each Consul or Political Agent will be limited to Tth of his sanctioned budget allotment. 4. With reference to conditions (2) and (8) referred to in paragraph 3 above, I am to explain that two classes of cases are likely to arise as regards the present incumbents of posts, which are now paid from general revenues and are pensionable, but which will hereafter be paid from the office or other contract allowance and will accordingly be non-pensionable, viz. :— (а) of men whose services will not be required in future by the Consul or Political Agent; and (б) of men whose services will be required in future by the Consul or Political Agent and who will be paid from the office allowance. (i) Cases falling under (a) should be dealt with under the rules in Section II of Chapter XVIII, Civil Service Regulations. (ii) As regards cases falling under (6), subject to the approval of the Secretary of State for India, the Government of India, are pleased to decide :3 (1) that all service paid from the office allowance will be treated as foreign service of the first kind in respect of which no contribu tion for leave allowancs and pension will be payable; and (2) that the officers concerned will continue to obtain leave under the Civil Service Regulations, subject to the discretionary control of the Consul or Political Agent. All allowances during privi lege leave whether taken by itself or in combination with other leave, will be met from the office allowance, while allowances during long leave will be met from general revenues, the rule in Article 335 (a), Civil Service Regulations, being relaxed for this purpose. the office allowance, the calculation of his emoluments counting towards pension will be based on the pay he was drawing immediately prior to his transfer to the t/wa-s'i-foreign service, following the rule in Articles 779 (b) and 754 (6) (ii), Civil Service Regulations, while his allowances during long leave will be similarly calculated. During privilege leave the Consul or Political Agent can give him any allowance he pleases, not less than the pay that he drew 7 in his last pensionable appointment under Government. If the officer is at a later date transferred to a pensionable post under Government he will simply be reverting from foreign service to Government service proper; and for the period during which he holds such pensionable post, the calculation of his emoluments for the purposes of leave allowances and pension will be based on the pay of the latter appointment. Should a Consul or Political Agent cease to require the services of an officer belonging to this class, he should give him three months’ notice of discharge, and at the same time advise the Government of India of his intention. If no suitable appointment in Government service can be provided for the officer he will be liable to be retired under the rules govering the grant of compensation pension. I am to request that you will furnish the Comptroller, India Treasuries, direct with a complete list of officers falling under this class. 5. In view of the peculiar conditions of service in the Persian Gulf, where incumbents of the pensionable posts will ordinarily be recruited by selection from the non-pensionable establishment, the Government of India are pleased to grant a general exemption from the provisions of Article 478 (a), Civil Service Regula tions, to all non-gazetted establishments in the Bushire Residency and other sub ordinate offices in the Persian Gulf. 6. In consequence of the introduction of the system described above, it has been decided to revise the various allotments for the Consulates and Agencies within your jurisdiction ; and the orders of the Government of India on each case are noted below. These orders are subject to the condition that the provision made in the office allowance of the different Agencies and Consulates for “ Care and Repair of Buildings,” though based on the sanctioned grants of previous years, must be regarded as tentative, and subject to revision as the result of the recom mendations, contained in your telegram No. 283, dated the 21st March 1912, and letter No. 630, dated the 24th March 1912. Under the above rules, for the period during which an officer is paid from Muscat. (a) Separate allotments are sanctioned under the following heads:— (i) Sal&amp;ry and allowances of gazetted officers as at present. (n) Establishment— Monthly. 1 Sub-Assistant Surgeon on emoluments as at present. 1 Second Clerk, pay (m) Travelling allowance (iv) Postage and telegram charges 1 Head Clerk, pay Shroff allowance 180 25 120 1,000* a year. 3,000* a year. ♦Fixed grant not to be increased or exceeded without the sanction of the Government of India.

The Shroff allowance of Rs. 25 a month paid to the Head Clerk for Treasury work w r ill be abolished on the next change of incumbents. If it is found neces sary to continue it after that event, the Political Agent will be required to find the money from his office allowance. In this connection I am to request that the present arrangement under which the duties of Treasurer and Accountant of the Muscat Treasury are combined in the hands of the Head Clerk may be discontinued. The pioper arrangement is, in the opinion of the Government of India, that the Head Clerk should be Ac countant and the 2nd Clerk Treasurer, or vice versa, as the Political Agent may decide. Pending consideration of the general proposals contained in your letter No. 630, dated the 24th March 1912, the Government of India are unable to cancel the arrangements recently sanctioned under which the care and repair of all public buildings in Muscat have been entrusted to the Bombay Public Works Depart ment.Bahrain.

(c) It will be observed that your proposal to increase the pay of the Head Clerk to Rs. 170 a month has not been sanctioned. In the opinion of the Govern ment of India an incremental pay of Rs. 120—6—50 should be sufficient. W ith reference to paragraph 4 of Mr. Wood’s letter No. 6, dated the 21st March 1912, • I am to explain that the Government of India consider it preferable to include the provision for the Second Clerk in the office allowance. {d) The Government of India approve of the suggestion that the Bahrain launch should be used to meet the requirements both of the Bahrain Agency and of the Bundar Abbas Consulate; the question of providing a separate launch for the latter station need not, therefore, be further considered. It is left to you to distribute the contract grant sanctioned to meet the charges on account of the launch between Bahrain and Bundar Abbas, should you consider desirable to do so. (e) These orders render unnecessary any further action with reference to the proposals contained in your letters Nos. 2064, 2405 and 3115 dated respec tively the 13th August, 16th September and 10th December 1911.

From— Major S. G. Knox, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 3586, dated the 27th Decemher 1908, on the subject of expenditure required for the upkeep of the steam launch Jjewis JPelly and the dinghy. 2. As directed in the last paragraph of your letter under reply, I have the honour to submit a proposition statement for sanction in duplicate. I would, at the same time, enquire whether the enhanced rate of ration money should be paid to the crew in anticipation of sanction next pay day or whether sanc tion should be awaited. 3. TV ith reference to the question of what savings can be reasonably anticipated in my budget for the current financial year for the working and upkeep of the steam launch and dinghy, I would express my regret that a careful examination of the balances under the various allotments leaves me doubtful whether much assistance can be expected from this Agency. 4. I have the honour to forward two statements prepared in my office showing (1) the anticipated expenditure on the working and upkeep of the steam launch and dinghy, (2) the utmost savings that can be anticipated under the various grants in my budget. 5. To the latter statement is appended a note showing that these savings are not all secure, and that some of the largest of them are contingent on the bills for articles already received or ordered and on their way not being received in time to be included in the accounts for the current financial year. 6. While repeating my expressions of regret from the little assistance I am able to afford in this matter, I would ask to be permitted to recall to your memory the fact that owing to an unfortunate accident to the mails, for which this office was in no way to blame, the accounts of the Agency began tne year crippled by the bills for February 1908, which amounted to Rs. 1,343-1 and had to be met by re-appropriation.

There will thus be a deficit under this head of Rs. 250 if the bill is received during the current year. Elags and stores. The balance appears large, but a set of signalling flags have been received and will have to be paid for and a reserve must also he kept for a lightning conductor estimated cost Rs. 216. It would therefore appear that there will be a deficit of Rs. 66, but against this must be entered credit for copper tape and nails received previously and returned to store undamaged. Cost of articles was Rs. 185 including a Jacob’s ladder for the flagstaff. Nothing can be expected under this heading unless the bills for signalling flags and supply of the lightning conductor are greatly delayed. Savings under feed of camels and tour charges will mean no more tours this year, but as the camels have been carried off and their return is uncertain, this saving seems probable. S. G.

In the circumstances explained, the Government of India are pleased to sanction an expenditure of Rs. 479 a month, as detailed in the margin, on account of the emoluments of the crew, with effect from the date of their arrival at Koweit, and up to the 31st March 3909. With effect from the 1st April 1909, however, the Government of India prefer to allot an annual grant for this purpose, as in the case of the Bahrein Agency launch, the details of dis bursement being left to you. I am accordingly to convey sanction to an annual expenditure of Rs. 5,750 on this account. The establishment employed under this authority will be non-pensionable. 1 Seacrniny ... Pay.

To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council.

Consular services m Persia in 1906-07 and 1907-08, I forward herewith a copy of a Memorandum prepared in this Office, and request that I may be supplied at an early date with the information desired therein. The most convenient course would be that a revised statement of expenditure should be furnished embodying the additional information required. 2. The increase in expenditure in 1907-08 is very considerable, amounting, even after deduction of the special payment of Rs. 60,000 in respect of Koweit under the Agreement with the Sheikh of the 15th October 1907, to 8,135L, and I request that, in addition to the information asked for in the Memorandum, I may be furnished with a brief statement in general terms of the chief causes of this increase. I observe that certain of the payments in 1907-08 are stated to include considerable sums in respect of 1906-07, but I presume that there were also considerable arrear payments in 1906-07. Some explanation is required of the continuous growth of the charges shown under the head of “ contingencies.” 3. A statement' 1 -' of the outlay at Imperial posts in Persia during 1906-07 and 1907-08 is inclosed # Inclosure in Foreign Office letter of p r . T prii 1909 (3194/09) ±or Purposes ol comparison. It will be observed that the total 1st April 1909 (3194/09). outlay in 1907-08 was somewhat less than in the previous j^ear. 4. With reference to the special item of expenditure at Koweit, I have to remark that such expenditure cannot properly be included in a statement of charges incurred in Persia. But it will be convenient to effect in connection with the annual settlement of the Persian charges an adjustment of the expenditure incurred at places in the Gulf and its 6314. I. 1416. Ai vicinity outside Persia which the British Treasury have agreed to share ; and I request that a statement of any charges of this kind up to the 31st March 1908 which have not yet been adjusted may be appended as a supplement to the statement of expenditure in Persia. I also request that this procedure may be followed in future. 5. It is extremely desirable, as I have said, that the information should be given to me at an early date. I have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) Morley of Blackburn.ENCLOSURES. Enclosure No. 1. MEMORANDUM. Persian Legation. Contmgencies. —The explanation given of the expenditure under the head “ Contingencies ” should apparently read as follows :—“ Of this “ amount Rs. 13,355 is on account of Jask Royalty for 1905-06 and “ 1906-07, being Rs. 17,647. 1. less Rs. 4,292. 1. (Krs. 14,593) repre- “ senting deductions, &amp;c.” Escort Charges. —The explanation given of the increase of Rs. 52,642. 1. 2. in the Escort Charges is not quite clear. The Government of India should be asked to state :— (а) The amount refunded to the Imperial Government in 1907-08. It is not clear from the statement whether this was Rs. 26,280. 1. 4. or Rs. 13,140. 0. 8. (б) How much, approximately, of the remaining expenditure in 1907-08 was for the first time charged in full to Indian revenues (in other words, what amount would under the system previously followed have been shared by the Imperial autho rities in the first instance or through the x\ccount Current, and so excluded from the statement) ? Special payment —The special payment of Rs. 60,000 by the Accoun tant-General, Bombay, being on account of Koweit, should be excluded from the statement of expenditure in Persia, and arrangements for recovery of the portion chargeable to Imperial revenues should be made separately in accordance with the instructions in the last paragraph of the covering Despatch. Seistan. Salaries. —The extent to which arrear payments enter into the figures of expenditure in 1907-08 makes it difficult to understand the exact position of affairs in the two years. If the expenditure in 1906-07 similarly includes arrear payments, the amount of these should be stated. In the correspondence between the Secretary of State and the Government of India regarding appointments in Seistan, the term “ Vice-consul ” has apparently been used only of the minor appointment at Koh-i-Malik Siah, held originally b} 7, Mahomed Ashraf Khan. The references to Lieutenant Daukes and Captain Kelly in connection with this appointment are not understood and should be explained. Contingencies. —No explanation is given of the increase under this head. Civil Buildings. —No information has apparently been furnished to the Secretary of State regarding the buildings in question. General. —The rate of expenditure at this Consulate appears to be very high. Excluding medical expenditure in connection with the plague (which shows a decrease in consequence of the cessation of the plague), there is an increase in the charges in 1907-08 of Rs. 29,343 (l,965h) 6314. BMeshed. Pay and Allowances .—It is not clear whether the figures given include the cost of the Military Attache, whose temporary appointment w-as covered by the terms of the letter from the Treasury to the Foreign Office of 25th January 1907, No. 1447 {see Enclosure No. 2 in Despatch from Secretary of State to Government of India, No. 34, 29th March 1907). The Government of India should also be asked to say whether the expenditure on the Military Attache prior to 1906-07 was' included in the previous annual statements of diplomatic and Consular expenditure in Persia. Permanent Establishment .—The increase under this head seems to have been very heavy. Contingencies. No explanation is given of the increase under this head. Turbat-i-Haidari. Salaries .—Presumably the payments to Captain Keyes and Captain Franklin in respect of periods in 1906-07 which are referred to in the “ Remarks ” column were made in 1907-08 ? Contingencies. Ihe increase under this head is not explained. General.—The rate of expenditure at this Consulate seems high, and the increase in 1907-08 considerable. Kerman. General.—-The increase of expenditure at this Consulate is very lar^e, the explanation given being that it is due to the inclusion of expenditure for several months of 1906-07 in the accounts of 1907-08. Before the accounts are forwarded to the Foreign Office information should be obtained as to the amount of increase under each head which is due to this cause. The Government of India should also state whether the expenditure in 1905-06 does not also include arrear payments, and if so to wffiat extent. ’ ’ ’ Bam. With reference to Enclosure No. 5 in the letter to the Foreign Office, °u “Iv ^ arc ^ l a8t ’ a c .°Py which was forwarded to the Secretary to inro ^ nc ^ a Foreign Department on the 4th June 1909, the Government of India should be asked to state whether the expenditure at Bam in 1906-07, which was shown in the statement accompanying their letter of 20th September 1908, No. 165, included the whole of the outlay in connection with that post. If not, particulars of the outlay omitted should be furnished. The date on which the expenditure in connection with Bam ceased, and the approximate amount ac 1 count of Bam in the accounts of expenditure at Kerman in 190/-08, should also be stated. Kermanshah. Supplies and Service and Contigencies .—Some explanation of the increase under this head is desirable. Arabistan. An explanation should be furnished of the increased expenditure on Allowances, and of the increase of Rs. 4,610, under Supplies and Services and Contingencies, independent of the amounts attributable to the Mohammerah launch and the Oil Syndicate Camp charges.Political and Secret ) Inference Paper.

Sir, We have the honour to reply to your Political despatch No. 6, dated the 13th January, 1905, regarding our proposals for providing in the cadre of our Political Department for the Consular posts at Bunder Abbas, Kermanshah, Ahwaz, and Kow jgjt, and also for the new post of Assistant to the Consul in Seistan. 2. Our main object in recommending that the five appointments should he provided on the scale proposed was to enable us to fill posts of such growing importance with senior officers if available, and to afford our Political officers the opportunities for promotion, which as we have explained in our despatch No. 2 (General), dated the 5th January, 1905, are inevitably required if the Department is to be reorganised and maintained on an efficient basis. The Lords Commissioners of the Treasury object to our scheme on the ground that, whereas a total charge of £4,560 per annum is proposed by us for four Indian officers, the total charge for 7 officers of the Persian Consular Service under the Foreign Office (including office allowances) is only £4,712 per annum. 3. Such a comparison between appointments filled by officers of the Indian Political Department and the Consular Service, respectively, must always reveal some disproportion on account of the higher scale of pay drawn by the former; hut we recognise the force of the Lords Commissioners’ argument, especially having regard to the fact that we are not likely, at present, to he able to fill the appointments in question with men more senior on the average than the present incumbents; and we are, therefore, prepared to abandon the request made in our Financial despatch No. 270 (Salaries, &amp;c.), dated the 21st July, 1904, for a permanent readjustment in the subsidy payable on account of the cost of Persian Consular establishments. 4. We now request that, in respect of the three posts at Bunder Abbas, ^ . u u Kermanshah, and Arabistan, the existing Cf. the last paragraph but one of Sir Horace ... . r i ° Walpole’s letter, dated the 29th September, 1904, to provisional arrangements for defraying the Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office. cos {. 0 £ appointments may Con tinue, and that the cadre of the Political Department may be increased with reference to these appointments by an addition to it of three permanent appoint ments of Political Assistant, 1st class, carrying local allowances of Rs. 200 a month. We also request that, for the reasons referred to in the last paragraph but two of Sir Horace Walpole’s letter, dated the 29th September, 1104, the Foreign Office may he asked to agree that, under the provisional arrangements mentioned above, half the actual cost of the appointments of Political Agent2 at Koweit and of Assistant to the Consul in Seistan may be defrayed from the Imperial Exchequer. We have separately recommended in our recent despatch No. 164 (General), dated the 24th August, 1^05, that half the cost of a new appointment of Assistant to the Resident at Bushire may he similarly provided; and, if these requests are acceded to, we would ask that the three posts may he included in the cadre of the Political Department by adding to it three permanent appointments—one of Political Assistant, 1st class, carrying a local allowance of Rs. 200, and two of Political Assistant, 3rd class, carrying local allowances of Rs. 100 a month each. Finally, with reference to your Political despatch No. 33, dated the 22nd April, 1904, in which you informed us of the acceptance by the Imperial Government of liability for half the cost of the tentative arrangements for the establishment of a Consul at Turbat-i-Haidari, we would ask that, in order to include this post also in the cadre of the Department, an additional appoint ment, carrying a local allowance of Rs. 200 a month, may be added to the grade of Political Assistant, 2nd class. We earnestly trust that our scheme, in its modified form, will prove accept able to the Lords Commissioners. The reduced rates of pay now proposed represent the maximum cost which can be incurred on account of the salaries attached to these appointments. The shared expenses will be actually cal culated with reference to the salaries drawn by the incumbents of the posts from time to time. 5. It will be clear, however, that the modifications now suggested will affect in a serious manner the proposals which we have submitted to you for the reorganisation of the Department. In the 18th paragraph of our despatch No. 2 (General), dated the 5th January., 1905, we provided permanent appointments in the cadre of the Political Department on the following scale, excluding local allowances, for the Consuls at Kermanshah, Turbat-i-Haidari, and Bunder Abbas, the Vice-Consul at Ahwaz, the Assistant to the Consul in Seistan, and the Political Agent at Koweit:— Rs. 1 Political Agency, 2nd class, @ Rs. 1,800 2 „ Agencies, 3rd „ „ 1,500 2 „ „ 4th „ „ 1,200 1 Assistant Political Agency, 3rd class, @ Rs. 500... 1,800 3,000 2,400 500 7,700 But in accordance with our modified proposals, the actual scale, inclusive of the new appointment of Assistant at Bushire, will be as follows :— 4 Assistant Political Agencies, 1st class, @ Rs, 900 1 ,&gt; ,, Agency, 2nd „ „ 700 2 „ „ „ 3rd ,, ,, 500 Rs, 3,600 700 1,000 5,300 6 . The effect of these changes will be to give a combined cadre composed of 70 officers of or above the rank of Political Agent, and 82 below it, instead of 75 and 76, respectively, as originally proposed. It is, however, essential that any reduction in higher appointments should be effected wholly on the military side, as changes in the civil cadre would vitiate the calculations upon which the scheme of the Government of India for the recruitment of the Indian Civil Service is based, and would also tend to make the prospects of Indian civilians less attractive in the Political Department than in the ordinary line. It is obvious, however, that the reduction of so many as five of the 49 higher appointments originally allotted to the military cadre and the simultaneous addi tion of six Assistant Political Agencies would seriously interfere with the promotion of military officers. Indeed, we estimate that, by reducing only two of the higher appointments, the result will be that the rate of promotion in their case will be on an average 1J years slower than for members of the Indian Civil Service. This somewhat slower rate of promotion for military99 C. L. TUPPER. officers is not incompatible with the intentions explained in paragraph 5 of our despatch No. 2 (General), dated the 5th January 1905. But we consider that it would be most inexpedient further to enhance the disparity between the prospects of the two services. Accordingly in revising the details of the reorganisation scheme to give effect to the changes discussed in this letter, we have proposed, while reducing the pay of five higher appointments, simultaneously to raise that of three lower ones. The net effect on the scheme as originally submitted is to reduce the number of Political Agents originally proposed by one in the second class and one in the third class, and to increase the number of Assistant Political Agents by one in the first class and one in the second class, an addition being also made in the third class to provide for the Assistant at Bushire. 7. The nature of these amendments will be more readily apprehended from tbe corrected copy of our original despatch which we now enclose for your information.

I am directed to address you on the subject of local allowances attached to posts in the Political Department of the Government of India. 2. As you are no doubt aware, the question of reorganising the Depart ment has been, for some time, under consideration. It has now been decided to recommend the introduction of a revised grading which, it is anticipated, will make service in the Department more attractive than it is at present. The cost of the new scheme is, however, very considerable ; and it is desirable, in the interests of economy, to minimise the increase of expenditure as far as may be found possible. 3. Incidental to the scheme, therefore, the question of redistributing, and, where possible, reducing local allowances, has arisen. These allowances have been granted, from time to time, for various reasons :—within India, in most cases for special work performed on behalf of a Native State ; on and beyond the frontier, as compensation for hardships undergone or as in Baluchistan to equalise the salaries of officers in charge of districts with those drawn in other provinces. It has now been determined, as a general principle to be acted upon for the future, to treat the latter class of allowances with as much liberality as is compatible with due economy and with the fact that the salaries of officers in the Department will approximate more closely to those received by officers in regular commissions in the provinces, and to curtail the former as far as is possible. 4. I am to enclose a statement which shows the allowances at present existing, and to invite an expression of your opinion as to the possibility of reductions, more specially in the allowances within India. In any case, as these appointments will now be classed as superior if the scheme is sanctioned it is proposed to abolish the Secretariat allowances drawn in Mysore, Central India, Hajputana, and Baluchistan (the Hyderabad allowances have already been abolished), and it seems to the Government of India that there are others for which no strong justification exists. I am, therefore, to request you to be so good as to examine each existing allowance in upon the need or otherwise for its continuanoe. I i 1 ’[Copy of Government of India despatch of 5th January 1905, amended m accordance with Government &lt;f India Despatches Nos. 16If. and 165 (General), dated the ftlfth August 1905.] No. 2 of 1905. GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. GENERAL. To The Right Hon’ble St. JOHN RRODRICK, Bis Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Dated Fort William, the 5th June 1905. Sib, In the eleventh paragraph of our despatch, No. 224 Frontier, dated 25th July 1901, we promised Lord George Hamilton that we would shortly present to him proposals for reorganising our Political Lepartment, so as to include the appointments and service which are required for the North-West Frontier Province, and to place the Department 'generally upon a sounder footing.^ The subject had been even then under our consideration for some time, since it had become evident that the service, which is constituted on the basis of the proposals which were submitted in,the despatch from Lord Elgin’s Government, No. 156, dated 14th November 1897, was not sufficiently strong to meet the demands upon it. The ever-increasing improvement and specialisa tion in the system of administration of the Native States in India necessitate the employment of a larger number of more highly trained officers to exercise the necessary political control over them. Further, if the internal administra tion of the North-West Frontier Province is to be maintained on its former lines of efficiency, the services of expert officers must be secured, and such officers are also required to ensure the full development of the tracts in Baluchistan and elsewhere that have come under our direct control. At the same time the introduction of Consular Officers trained in the diplomatic service of Foreign Powers into those tracts in Persia and in the Persian Gulf where our Political Officers formerly worked alone has rendered it necessary for us to select our Consular and Political Agents with special care in order to ensure that they possess proper qualifications for their delicate and important duties. All of these considerations have led us to the conclusion that a radical reform in the conditions of our Political Department was inevitable. 2. The desirability of a reorganisation of the Department has been greatly emphasised in recent years by the facts that the number of the appointments which have to be filled from its ranks has increased, and that there has for some years been an increasing difficulty in attracting to the lower grades members of2 the Indian Civil Service of suitable standing and attainments. As illustrating the first of these conditions we may men tion that there are at this moment 10 * members of the Political Department employed on special duties, while, as you are aware, 4) f othcers of the service are filling new Consular posts in Persia and on the Persian Gulf, which have not yet been added to the cadre. We have also to add the post of Resident at Indore, which must now become permanent, and we are anxious to provide, as a cadre appointment, the post of Political Agent for Bansvvara, Partabgarh, and Dungarpur. The difficulty of securing the services of suitable members of the Indian Civil Service of from four to six years’ service for political work is easily explained by the fact that such officers lose, at present, between Es. 200 and Rs, 400 a month by entering the Department, and they are naturally averse from incurring this loss without some very substantial prospective advantage;* and this, at present, is not afforded by the pay of the senior grades to which a member of the Indian Civil Service may claim to attain without selection. Colonel A. H. McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.E. Major K. D Erskine. Colonel F. E. Younghusband, C.I E. Mr. R. Hughes-Buller. Mr. H. li. C. Hobbs. Captain R.A.E. Benn, C.I.E. Captain C. B. Winter. Captain C. E. Luard. Captain A D. G. Ramsay. Lieutenant R. H. Cbenevix-Trench. Lieutenant T. H. Keyes. Captain H A. K. Gougb. Lieutenant D. L. R. Lorimer. Captain S. G. Knox. 3. The first remedy which suggested itself was the obvious one of levelling the pay of the Political Department up to the rates of salary attaching to the appointments in the ordinary line in the different Provinces ; and proposals were formulated on this basis. On examination we found that the cost of this scheme was prohibitive, and that it was further open to the objection that it raised the remuneration of that larger portion of the service which is officered from the Indian Army, beyond what, upon a review of the existing conditions of the Department, was considered necessary. It might, indeed, be argued that all officers doing the same work should receive the same pay, and that if it were found necessary to improve the prospects ot one branch of the service, then the remainder also should benefit. This argument cannot, however, in our opinion, be sustained. There are many posts—indeed, an increasing number—in the Department for which the training of a civilian is essential, and for which we must always he in a position to recruit from the Indian Civil Service; hut we do not consider that this necessity would justify us in raising the salaries throughout the Department to the level of that which members of the Indian Civil Service are entitled to expect. Moreover, the suggestion w'as disapproved of in Lord George Hamilton’s despatch of the 10th Pebruary 1898. As an alternative it was then suggested that members of the Indian Civil Service in the grades on Rs. 1,800 and below should be allowed to draw 10 per cent..over and above the pay of the grade in w hich they were placed. To this theie are the objections common to any system in which two classes of officers, graded together, receiv e distinct rates of pay; and though an examination of the suggestion disclosed the fact that, in the result, members of the Indian Civil Service would thereby be placed in a position which would in most cases leave them a salary approximating to what they might expect to draw in the regular line, we preferred to work out the third alternative which seemed to us somewhat less open to the objections noticed. 4. The scheme which w e have now decided to recommend for your approval is, in principle, that which was indicated in the despatch from Lord Elgin’s Government, No. 97, dated 30th June 1898, namely, to establish a separate cadre for members of the Indian Civil Service within the Department. This is not open in the same degree to the objections which exist in the case of the 10 per cent, proposal, while it will enable Government, by reserving a certain measure of freedom in effecting promotions and in importing members of the Indian Civil Service of higher standing, to prevent a too rapid rate of advance ment. In the event of a block of promotion, we would deal with it, in the civilian cadre, by a scale of minimum salaries based on length of service,3 or by permission to revert to the Province from which the sufferers had been recruited. The minimum that we would propose, should such a remedy here after prove to be necessnry, is the guarantee to each member of the Indian Civil Service of a salary (inclusive of allowances) of Its. 100 per mensem for each completed year of service up to a maximum of Es 2,500 for 25 years* service. If the maintenance of a dual cadre is found, after experience of its working, to be undesirable, it may be necessary to revert to a joint cadre, but by that time we shall have surmounted the initial difficulties connected with the amalgamation of the North West Frontier Commission with the Political Department, and the proportion of members of the Indian Civil Service in the service will have been so increased, and their positions so fixed, that it may be possible to constitute the whole service upon the basis of a regular Commission without entailing unnecessary expense ou Government or causing friction amongst the officers in the service. 5. Turning now to the considerations upon which our proposals, as affecting the military members of service, are based, while holding, as already stated, that it is not necessary to equalise the prospects of military officers in the Department with those of members of the Indian Civil Service, we are, never theless, of opinion that a material improvement in them is desirable. Under present conditions, the promotion of military officers is very slow. This state of things is due, partly to the necessity of working up to the strength sanctioned for members of the Indian Civil Service, the appointment of whom to grades suitable to their standing occasions the reversion of military officers; partly to the necessity of occasional selection from outside the Department for appoint ment to the higher grades, which, though notin strictness a legitimate grievance, as it is one of tne recognized conditions of the service, nevertheless causes the disappointment of expectations and a good deal of uneasiness and discontent; and partly to the numerous additions to the lowest grade, which have been made to meet the growing requirements of the service. As instances of slow promotion, we cite below a few typical cases :— Major LeMesurier, Captain Forbes, Captain Kennion, Major Windham, all joined in 1895, and are now Political .Assistants, 2nd class, on Rs. 600 a month. Captain F. C. Webb-Ware joined in August 1896, and received his first promotion in October 190U Captain E. Barnes, Captain A. B. Drummond, Captain A L. Jacob, and Captain F. B. Prideaux, all joined in 1895 and 1896, and have not yet been promoted above the lowest grade. * Our aim in elaborating the proposals detailed below has, therefore, been to arrange for members of the Indian Civil Service such a rate of promotion as will bring their prospects up to the level ot what they might reasonably count on in their own Provinces: and to provide for military men prospects which, though not so good as those of members of the Indian Civil Service, shall be somewhat more favourable than those to which they can at present look for ward. The necessary distinction has been made by arranging so that military promotion will be somewhat slower than that of members of the Indian Civil Service, particularly in the higher grades. This mode of differentiation appears to be the least invidious that could be adopted. As an additional reason for improving the emoluments of both the civil and military members of the Department, it may be mentioned that, in the majority of cases, Political officers serving in the Native States have hitherto occupied free houses and enjoyed the use of carriages supplied by the States to which they were accre dited. It has now, however, been decided to do away with these and sundry other privileges which, though sanctioned by long custom, are considered to be open to objection, and the enhanced rates of pay provided by our present scheme will synchronise with the loss of advantages hitherto enjoyed, the deprivation of which will necessarily entail considerable additional expenditure, on our representatives in N ative States, if they are to maintain in a suitable manner the dignity of the positions which they occupy. * /4 6 Prior to the creation of the North-West Frontier Province the Political Department was organised as follows :— Civilian s. Cadre posts* Furlough reserve 18 2 Military Officers. * Of these, of Ks. 1,000. 38 carry a pay in excess Cadre posts* Margin and leave reserve Probationers Total 20 ... 47 ... 19 ... 6 72 ... 92 The number oi cadre posts is now 66, owing to alterations which have smeebeen made m their details, certain appointmentshaving been created and others abolished, namely : catou Political Agent in Southern Baluchistan, abolished. Assistant Political Agent in Zhob, abolished. Assistant to our Agent in Khorasan, abolished. General Superintendent, Thagi and Dakaiti Department, abolished. Political Agent, Loralai, created. Assistant Political Agent, Loralai, created. Consulship at Kerman, created. „ Seistan, created. 1 Assistant Political Agent, Mekran, created. But the inclusion of the Political Agency for Banswara, referred to in paragraph 2, will render the appointment of an Assistant to the Resident n Mewar unnecessary; we therefore desire to abolish the latter appointment this arrangement would again reduce the number of cadre posts to 66. ’ The number of cadre posts in the North-West Province, excluding three appointments in Dir, Swat and Chitral, which are provided for within the cadre of our Political Department as at present constituted, is 31 param-inh 8 of »ur despatch No. 124, (Frontier), dated the 25th July 1901 and T nr!t ? fw 8 Ham,Hen’s despatch No. S9 (Political), dated the 2oth September l!? 01 of which 18 are c assed as superior and 13 as inferior. This proportion of in erior to supenor posts is m excess ot the proportion of 4-5 per cent usually observed between superior aud inferior appointments in the regular Provinces 7 Such an excess is, however, necessary as was explained in paragraphs 122 and 124 of the scheme which formed an enclosure of our despatch above refereed to f As was there pointed out the special nature of the work to be performed on the frontier both involves a high degree of wear and tear and requires an unusuJllv arge proportion of European officers in subordinate posts. Moreover the calculations in the next paragraph will show that the general clstHudon of the Department can be so arranged as to provide for these junior posts without unduly retarding the flow of promotion.

But as explained in paragraph 6 of our despatch No. 165-G., dated 24th August 1905, we propose to provide for 73 officers in the higher grades in order ta prevent the undue retardation of promotion in the military cadre. On the basis of 73 superior appointments, the strength of the Department according to the accepted method of calculation would work out as follows Number of superior posts ... ... ... . _ 73 Add 4&lt; per cent, for temporary appointments and deputations ... 3 Total number of appointments to be filled by men on duty of over 8 years'’service ... ... ... ... . t 73 Add inferior appointments at 42 5 per cent ... ... ... 32 Total number of appointments ... ... ... ... 1 Q 8 Total strength of service at IQfi'? per cent, of 76 ... ... 14.9 The circumstances of the Department, however, involve some changes in the method of calculation usually applied in the case of the Indian Civil Service. Thus in the case of the members of the Civil Service, they will not he generally taken into the Department till they have on an average completed about 4 years’ service, so that if the number of inferior posts is calculated in the same proportion as that adopted in the case of the Indian Civil Service for members between the 3rd and 8th years’ service there would be a block in promotion in the Political Department as compared with that prevailing in the Civil Service in the various provinces; in the military cadre, on the other hand, a higher percentage of inferior posts can be allotted without unduly retarding promotion, because one year’s training is generally found to be sufficient for a military officer in the Political Department, whereas, in the scheme for recruit ment of the Indian Civil Service two years’ training is allowed for. Taking these circumstances into consideration it is found by calculation that to give a rate of promotion to the superior grades in these cases equivalent to what is obtained in the regular line of the Civil Service the percentage of inferior to superior posts should be 27'9 in the case of the civilian cadre and 50 in that of the military cadre instead of 42‘o, the figure usually adopted in dealing with the Civil Service generally. In the case of the Civil Service, however, the officers of the 3rd and 4th years’ service who would ordinarily make up the remainder of the full percentage of 42-5 will remain in the grades of Assistant Collectors in the various provinces, while the members of the Indian Civil Service in training, to take the place of those holding the superior posts in the Political Department, will also have to he provided for in the grades of Assistant Collector with the exception of one who will be trained in the North-West Frontier Province. According to the above calculation, the number of inferior appointments in the civil and military cadres should be respectively 8 and 24. There are, however, as shown in paragraph G above, 111 cadre posts for which officers are required to he on duty ; and as we have provided for only 73 superior appointments, a balance of 38 inferior appointments remains to bo accountedfor. We therefore propose to add G more inferior appointments to the Military cadre. This addition will make the promotion of military officers to the superior grades slower than that of civilians, and is in accordance with the principles laid down in paragraph 5 above, but it will, as elsewhere shown, still leave their prospects considerably better than at present. We have further increased the military training reserve from 4 (the figure arrived at by the usual method of calculation) to 6 . We consider the higher figure necessary to meet the special requirements of the Department as explained below and to enable us to provide duly qualified junior officers when emergencies arise. Altering the calculation for total strength as explained above, the strength of the Department will work out as follows, on the assumption that the service will, in future, he composed as far as may he conveniently possible of 30 per cent, members of the Indian Civil Service and 70 per cent, military officers, and on this point we would desire to express our conviction that this is the result w hich should he aimed at in future in order to secure a sufficient proportion of the former element. At present the proportion is more nearly one-fourth to three- fourths, and difficulty is occasionally experienced in officering those posts adequately in wTiich the training of a member of the Indian Civil Service is essential :— — Civil.

J The seven officers who will be provided for in the grades of Assistant Collectors will be made up of three in training, three in the 3rd and 4th years’ service, and one for a leave reserve on the same. 8 . It is more than probable that, within a very short time, we shall he compelled to appoint other officers to the semi-consular posts in Persia and the Persian Gulf. You have already sanctioned, proposals to post officers of the Political Department at Koweit and Bahrein ; we have accordingly included these appointments in our present scheme. Katif and other places, which are attracting daily a greater share of the attention of Foreign Powers, may also at any time require, for the protection of our parnmpunt interests, the appoint ment of a representative of the Government of India, hut we have made no provision here to meet these probable cDntingencies. In these circumstances, u r e do not consider that a Department, recruited to provide a margin of only 4 per cent, for deputations will prove at all too large. Indeed we fear that it may prove, at no distant date, inadequate, as, owing to2 1.89,650 8 the distances to he traversed by officers on transfer, their services are lost to Gov ernment for a longer period than is the case elsewhere. Moreover, as explained in paragraph 2, the number of officers on deputation is, owing to the special nature of the duties to be performed by the Department, much larger than it would be in an ordinary Commission in India. The most scientific way of arranging for future recruitment would be largely to raise the percentage for temporary appointments and deputations in order to meet the special circum stances of the Department. This would, however, involve a greatly increased cost, and we believe that we can secure the necessary number of officers by add ing to the number of inferior appointments and probationers in the military cadre without unduly retarding promotion in that cadre. We do not, therefore, desire to urge this point now, and shall be content to rest the case for the adoption of our proposals on the above calculations which are based on the actual requirements of the Department. 9. It is now necessary to explain how we propose to grade the service and to distribute the appointments on the different grades between members of the Indian Civil Service and military officers. We propose to abolish two grades, on Rs. 2,000 and Rs. 3,000, which have no counterpart in the regular Commissions elsewhere, to reallot the appointments, throughout the grades, and to distribute them between the two branches, in the following manner: Suggested civil and military cadres.

This differs from the usual practice, but is considered desirable in view of the fact that with the exception of the two junior officers referred to in note (b) above, members of the Indian Civil Service will not ordinarily be taken into the Political Department until they have rendered from 4 to 6 years’ service and it is desired to avoid any possibility of any of them reverting to a pay of Rs. BOO which might occasionally happen however carefully the percentage for leave reserve may be calculated. The effect of making the provision in the higher grades is nominally to increase the total cost of the scheme, but such increase is to a great extent more apparent than real, as, even if provided for in the lowest grade, these officers would ordinarily be acting on salaries equivalent to the pay of the higher grades. 10 . In paragraph 5 of his despatch No. 89 (Political), dated 20th Septem ber 1901, Lord George Hamilton reserved his opinion on our proposal to include the posts in the North-West Prontier Province in the Political Department, until he should be placed in possession of our views with regard to the reorga nisation of the Department. These have now been described in general outline above, but we desire to explain, in greater detail, how they will work in practice when applied to individual cases and in regard to the administrative needs of the new Province. 11 . One point in regard to the dual cadre system must be emphasised. It is necessary to postulate that although, for purposes of recruitment, and in order to effect an equitable distribution of attainable posts throughout both cadres of the reconstituted Department, we have allotted a particular number of each class of the 12 highest posts respectively to the military and civil branches of the service, we regard it as essential, for the efficient working of the Depart ment, that these appointments shall be filled by selection, not only from either cadre, but, if necessary, from outside the Department. For the most important Residencies the Viceroy must have a free hand, and should be able to select the best men available. The distribution of such appointments between the military and civil cadres is, however, shown for purposes of recruitment, and will be adhered to as far as the exigencies of the public service and individual fitness permit. • Lientenant-Colonel E. Inglis. Major C. B. Kawlinson. Major C. P. Thoirpson. Captain B. C. Water field- Captain D. B Blakeway. Major J. 0. Roos-Keppel. Captain VV. J. Keen. 12. The military officers of the Punjab Commission (7* in number) serv ing in the North-West Prontier Province will, if our proposals are approved, be brought on to the civil cadre of the recon* stituted Department. In the Punjab Commission they have always been on the same footing as members of the Indian Civil Service and they are entitled to be treated as such, and to occupy positions, corresponding to those which they now hold with reference to members of tbe Indian Civil Service. It is of great importance to retain in the province the officers, or at any rate the senior officers, who have been serving there, and who know the country, and we anticipate that, unless their claims be recognised in this way, they will claim to revert to the Punjab Commission, in w T hich, owing to the exceptionally rapid promotion in the years to which these officers belong, the prospects of the majority of them are exceedingly good. Gradually, as general recruitment for the amalgamated Department progresses new men will grow up who will have acquired frontier experience, and free transfers between the North-West Prontier Province and the other political areas will he possible ; but for the moment we must retain the services of the senior officers whom we have transferred from the Punjab Commission. 13. One feature of the scheme, to which we attach considerable import ance because of the administrative convenience which should ensue, is the almost complete abolition of localised salaries; but to this reform there must be a few exceptions. One of these must occur in the ca*e of the four chief judicial appointments on the North-West Prontier. As you are aware, the judicial branch of the service is somewhat less popular and attractive than the executive line, and the judicial appointments in the Political Department10 are so few i n number that it is important to offer such attractions ns may induce some of the men who, in the early days of service, have acquired as Assistant Commissioners a certain degree of judicial training, to elect for the judicial line. In the Punjab the reluctance of men to elect for judical work has been recognised, and it has there been found necessary to increase the pay of the judicial appointments. After careful consideration of the matter, and after consultation with the Judicial Commissioner of the North-West Frontier Province, we propose that the appointment of Judicial Commissioner (on Ps. 2,750) be classed as a Residency of the 2nd class; and that the three chief judicial appointments of the Province (at present on Rs. 2,250, Rs. 1,800 and Rs. 1,500) which have been surrendered from the Punjab cadre be graded as Political Agencies of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd classes, respectively, and be localised in the North-West Frontier Province. A man holding the judicial appoint ment on Rs. 1,500 would, then, ordinarily officiate on Rs. 1,800 if the permanent incumbent in the latter post were away on leave, even although his seniors in the J'rd class of Political Agents were not officiating in the higher grade; while the localisation of the Judicial Commissionership as a Residency, 2nd class, will afford an inducement to officers holding judicial posts to remain in them in the hopes of being selected to that position. One other appointment in that province, for which also special qualifications are needed, is the Revenue Commissionership, which we have classed as a Residency of the 3rd class on Rs. 2,500. 14. We have caused to be prepared, for your information, two statements A and B, showing how our scheme of reorganisation, if it were introduced to-day, would affect individuals. You will see that, by including the Punjab Commission military officers in list A (the civil cadre list) the civil cadre will he just filled and that there is an aggregate improvement in salaries of Rs. 6,900. The improvement in the military cadre is Rs. 12,200. The result to the individual, it will he seen, works out an average increase •Including Messrs. Clarke and Davis in the 9,^ Ulilit.iry officer, and military list Rs. 141 for cachf member of the Indian Commission.^ military ° fficer8 ' tbe Puniab Ci . vi } Service, if those in the Punjab Com- mission be included in the calculation; but as the latter are already drawing average Provincial rates of pay, the effect of the scheme on the classes for whose relief mainly this reorganisation is demanded, will be better shown by including only those members of the Indian Civil Service already in the Political Department, and, in that case, the average increase amounts to Rs. 312 a month. These statements, it should be observed, show the ultimate effect of our proposals; for some time the cost will of necessity be greater, by the grant of personal allowances. 1 here are a few individual cases in which there will be an immediate loss of substantive salary, and this we think should he prevented; we accordingly propose that a personal allowance, of such amount as will bring his emolu ments up to the figure which he is drawing at the time the reorganization is effected, be granted to each individual whose substantive pay is reduced by the measure; such personal allowances to continue until the officers’ total emoluments rise to the amount which they are drawing at the time the scheme is introduced. We are unable to form an exact estimate of the cost of this part of our proposals, because, as will be explained below, we contemplate the grant of certain local allowances, and upon the allotment of these will, in some instances, depend the amount of compensation due. 15. We recognise that difficulties will occur in adhering strictly to the dual cadre in the case of temporary officiating promotions from the grades of Assistants to those of Political Agents in connection with the amalgamation of the appointments in the North-West Frontier province. To provide for this, it will be necessary to make it a rule that when an officer of one cadre is for reasons of administrative convenience appointed to officiate for an officer in the other cadre in charge of a district he shall draw the acting allowance admissi ble under rule, but that all other acting grade promotions consequent on such appointment shall be given in the cadre of the officer who creates the officiat ing vacancy.16. We now come to the question of local allowances which we have referred to in the preceding paragraph. As you are aware the whole present cost of the Political Department is not represented by the grade pay alone. Partly owing to the inadequacy of the salaries attached to particular appoint ments in the past, whether on account of the work and responsibility, or of the expense of entertaining, and partly in order to compensate for the unpleasant climate and the solitude which characterise many posts, it has, from time to time, been necessary to sanction allowances either local or special. Within 'India these allowances have, in practically all instances, been granted in consider ation of work done over and above the duties ordinarily attaching to the appointment, as, for example, the administration or management of a State during minority ; and they are in most cases paid by the States k for whom the special service is performed. On and beyond the frontier, where special knowledge and continuity are peculiarly valuable, and where, so frequently, life is an absolute solitude, while the work, though not always heavy, presents unusual difficulty and involves great responsibility, the allowances, which are local, generally represent the measure of compensation to officers for the hardships undergone or for their complete severance from civilised society. The general principle which we have determined should be acted upon in the future is to treat the latter class of allowance with as much liberality as is compatible with due economy, while curtailing the former so far as is possible. In the past we have been handicapped in our endeavours by the feeling that it was impossible for us to insist that our Political Officers should maintain the dignity and keep up the appearances which are desirable, on salaries which have been, in some cases, less than what would be drawn by an officer of cor responding rank with a regiment who Las no such obligations. TVe believe that, with the grading revised as we have proposed, we shall be able to dispense gradually with all allowances within Native States which are not specially fixed as remuneration for special work done. •A. .peciaed io .noiosure o attactad. The allowances at present* drawn are— Bs. In India (excluding sumptuary) ... ... 2,950 Foreign and beyond ... ... ... 5,380 Total ... 8,330 The first named are, as has been stated, for the most part paid by the Native States for whom the services are performed. For the two Assistant Secretaries in the Foreign Office Secretariat, however, when they are officers of and below the grade of Political Agent, 4 th class, we propose to give a local allowance of Rs. 300 a month. The work is extremely trying and responsible, and the expenses at Simla and Calcutta are very great. On thp other hand, it has already been necessary to recommend certain additional local allowances for officers appointed to newly-created Consular posts in Persia and the Persian Gulf, and, while we do not feel that we can undertake absolutely to limit the total sum of the local allowances attaching to apointments in the Department, we propose for the future to endeavour not to exceed a total of Rs. 8,000 a month. It is, of course, possible that, with the inevitable creation of new trans-frontier pests, necessitated by our increased responsibilities and interests in Persia, the Gulf, and elsewhere, we may also have to propose new allowances, and these are not included in our estimated total. But the allowances aggregating Rs. 2,450 shown in statement C as paid from Native States and which, for the most part, are fixed as special remunera tion for special -work done, are included. Excluding such contingencies, however, we trust that you will accord your general approval to our proposal to limit, if possible, the total allowances, excluding sumptuary allowances, approximately to Rs. 8,000, and to the principle that they shall, as a generalrule, be confined to frontier nd traus-frontier appointments and shall only rarely be granted within India, India, • Fide the undermentioned desp atches * Despatch from the Government of No. 307. dated 24th September 1889.

We enclose, for your information, a copy of a reference § we have , , made to the heads of our Political Admi- § No. 861-G., dated the 6th May 190 . nistrations on the subject of the redistri bution of allowances, and shall, on receipt of the replies, do ourselves the honour of addressing you further on this subject; inviting your sanction to each separate alteration we propose. Upon the decision that may be come to in that matter will also depend, as we have explained in paragraph 12, the total amount of personal compensation that may have to be paid to the very few officers whose substantive salary may be prejudicially affected by the reorganisation scheme. 18. It now remains to consider the additional cost involved in our proposals. A proposition statement is attached, from which the following figures are extracted, which will show at a glance the financial results of what we have proposed :— Present monthly cost of the Political Department, including allowances, and excluding temporary appointments ... Present cost of the North-West Frontier Province Commission, including the appointments sanctioned in Secretary of State’s despatch No. 89 (Political), dated 29th September 1901, including allowances...

The officers holding these seven existing posts at present draw the pay of their grade; in order to provide for them in the revised scheme, we have treated them as being— 1 Political Agency, 4th class, at Rs. 1,200 4 Assistant Political Agencies, 1st class, at Rs. 900 1 ,, „ t) 2nd „ at ,, 700... 2 „ „ „ 3rd „ at „ 500...

We venture to hope that you will regard this increase as justified by the circumstances of the case. The wide enlargement of the area over which the work of the Department now extends, the increasing reponsibilities thereby entailed, and the positive necessity of attracting the very best men whom \ve can procure to the ranks of the Political Service, are, in our opinion, conclusive reasons for an amelioration of conditions that no longer respond to the needs of the time. Our present proposals are the result of more than four years,discussion of a necessarily very complex and difficult question in the different Departments of our Government and they represent, in their final shape, a unanimity at which it has not been easy to arrive, and which we see no chance of obtaining by any more restricted scheme. We trust, therefore, that if we have been fortunate enough to convince you of the urgent need for reorganisa tion you will find a satisfactory solution in the plans that we now submit, and will enable us to proceed with them at as early a date as you may deem possible.

I have the honour to invite a reference to Foreign Department letter No. 3936-E. B. f dated the 9th November 1904, sanctioning estimates of the probable cost of the Political Agency establishment at Koweit, and with reference to paragraphs 2 (i) and 3 (d) and (g) thereof to forward copy of letter No. 138, dated 5th January 1905, from the Political Agent, Koweit, submitting his views with regard to the points upon which Government have called for further explanation. 2. Captain Knox does not consider it possible to curtail the number of Kawasses or to reduce their pay, but he proposes certain alterations in the boat establishment, the result of Which will be a net annual saving of Rs. 204. This saving, however, will not only be absorbed, but an extra expenditure of Rs. 71 per annum will be necessary to provide for the expenditure resulting from Captain Knox’s proposals regarding the dispensary. It appears that a sweeper has been already engaged from the 6th November 1904 on Rs. 10 per mensem, for which no provision was made in the dispensary establishment. Again, it is proposed to increase the allotment for “ Medical Contingencies ” from Rs. 25 per annum provided in the estimate to Rs. 180. 3. I think, however, that Captain Knox’s proposals regarding the dispensary are reasonable, considering the popularity which this institution is said to have acquired within so short a time, and I accordingly trust that the .Government of India Will be pleased te accord the necessary sanction. 4. The proposals as regards the boat establishment and the entertainment of a sweeper for the dispensary have been embodied in a Proposition Statement which is submitted in duplicate in accordance with Article 57 of Civil Account Code, and I would request that the entertainment of the dispensary sweeper may be sanctioned with effect from the 6th November 1904.

I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 1496, dated the 8th December 1904, in which an expression of my views is called for with reference to the points upon which further report is called for by Govern ment in letter No. 3936-E. B., dated the 19th November 1904, to your address. 2. With reference to the Kawass establishment, I have the honour to state that I consider the work cannot be carried on efficiently with fewer men nor is it possible to reduce their pay if men of the proper class are to be induced to serve. The conditions in Bussorah approach more closely to those of Koweit than other Gulf stations do, and I recently had an opportunity of enquiring into the pay and conditions of Kawass service there. I find that the Kawass Basbi receives Rs. 20 and the Kawasses Rs. 15 each, and that they are more liberally treated in the matter of clothing. Incidentally I would point out in addition that the cost of living and prices for men of that class are considerably lower in Bussorah than they are in Koweit. 3. An appreciable saving can however be effected in the boat establish ment. Only four men need be employed, but to induce them to serve, a higher rate of pay is required or they will desert in the pearling season. The rates of pay to which I trust to receive sanction are as follows Rs. 1 Nakhoda . . 20 per mensem. 2 boatmen at Rs. 15 each . .... 30 „ 1 boy 12 „ Total • 622 r 1 onT 11 r ° Su t in a savin 8 0n the original proposals of Rs. 17 per mensem or its. 204 per annum.

Fort William, the 19th January 1905. i/ ‘ Sir, With reference to your telegram, dated the 28th July 1904, we have V? 1 the honour to forward, for information, a copy of the correspondence detailed in the annexed schedule, relative to the probable cost of establishing a Political Agent at Koweit. 2. It will be seen that the estimates were framed before the question of the temporary withdrawal of the Agent had been mooted; but the expenditure now proposed in them will still be requisite in view of the periodical visits by him to Koweit, which are contemplated by His Majesty’s Government. With the slight modifications which we have made, they involve an annual recurring expenditure of Es. 24,843 a year on establishments, and of Es. 4,689 on other services, plus an initial outlay of Es. 5,500, as shown in the enclosed statement marked D. The estimates appear to us moderate, and we have sanctioned them provisionally, subject to your confirmation. We have called for a further report in respect of the charges for menial establishment and the annual recurring expenditure on other services. 3. It will be observed that the expenses connected with the British Post Office at Koweit have been incorporated in the estimates under reference, as this establishment will be under the supervision of the Political Agent. In , accordance with the instructions conveyed in your telegram, dated the 19th r October 1904, the Assistant Surgeon, previously detained at Bushire, has been ordered to proceed to Koweit in a professional capacity. He has, however, been permitted to take with him the postal peon, as he will be of assistance in many ways, and it will enable the immediate opening of the Post Office as soon as authority for doing so is granted by His Majesty’s Government. desirable to furnish to the Agency, no proposal will be made until the Agent’s practical experience has placed him in a position to advise on the subject. 5. Some explanation is due in regard to the item of Es. 1,200 in the amount of initial outlay on local allowance to the Political Agent. In our despatch No. 27tf of 21st July last, on the subject of additions to the cadre of the Political Department in Persia and at Koweit, a general proposal was made that each post should have attached to it a local allowance of only Es. 200. In view of the fact, however, that a local allowance of Es. 400 per mensem is granted to the Political Agent at Maskat, the Government of India agreed to Captain Knox receiving a local allowance at the same rate during the first six 4.

The recent decision that the Political Agent should not reside throughout the whole year at Koweit has, however, led to a reconsideration of the point, and it has now been decided that the usual rate of Rs. 200 will suffice. Captain Knox has accordingly been informed that, from the termination of the first six months of his stay there, the local allowance will he reduced to Its. 200 a month.

From—The Under-Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Depart ment, To—W. C. Macpherson, Esq., C.S.I., Chief Secretary to the Government of Bengal. I am directed to request that, if His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor has no objection, the services of Civil Assistant Surgeon Daudar Rahman Khan, M.B., may be placed at the disposal of the Foreign Department for deputation to Koweit, to hold charge of a Post Office, to perform such sanitary and medical duties as may he required of him, and to be the local representative of the Indian Government under the orders of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 2. The Assistant Surgeon will receive the pay of his grade, plus a local allowance of Rs. 100 a month, Rs. 30 a month sumptuary allowance, and Rs. 12 a month house-rent. He will also receive an outfit allowance of Rs. 150. He should be directed to proceed at once to Bushire; but, before leaving India, he should be directed to visit Bombay en route, so as to allow of his obtaining general instructions from the office of the Postmaster-General, and learning the simple departmental procedure which he will have to follow. When the Post Office is opened at Koweit, the Postmaster-General, Bombay, will depute the Superintendent of the Persian Gulf to see on the spot that the Assistant Surgeon understands the work which he will have to undertake. 3. A postman, to perform the work of packer and stamper, will be deputed to accompany the Assistant Surgeon to Koweit, and the necessary office furni ture, seals, forms, &amp;c., will be supplied by the Postmaster-General, Bombay, who will arrange to have them despatched by the steamer by which the Assistant Surgeon may travel. An allowance of Rs. 3 a month has also been sanctioned to cover the cost of office contingencies. 4. The Sheikh of Koweit will arrange for a house to be placed at the disposal of the Assistant Surgeon, who should report himself to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire, before proceeding to take up his appointment at Koweit, in order that he may there receive instructions in regard to his attitude generally, and to the duties other than postal and medical that he will be expected to perform. 5. Arrangements will be made for the supply at Bombay of a simple medical and surgical outfit sufficient to enable the Assistant Surgeon to begin professional work in a small way.1 No. 239, dated Bushire, the 30th July 1904. From Major P Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—L. W. Dane, Fsq., C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign De partment. In accordance with the telegraphic instructions received under Foreign Department No. 2317-E A., dated 21st July 1904, I have the honor to submit proposals for the Establishment of the Political Agent at Koweit. I have done my best to consider economy and, at the same time, to omit nothing needful. 2 . The proposals are embodied in— (t) The usual proposition statement showing the actual establishment; (ii) Statement A dealing with initial expenditure ; {Hi) Statement B dealing with annual recurring expenditure. 3. As regards {ii) and {Hi) such explanations as I have thought it neces sary to make have been entered in the remarks column of,the two statements A and B. With reference to the proposition statement, the establishment has been drawn up on the lines of the Maskat Political Agency after the exclusion of the Treasury establishment at that place. Higher rates have been proposed for the copyist and munshi because, in consequence of the greater distance from India and more expensive livin° , I it will be difficult to induce competent men to come and serve. The pay of the kavas bashi and kavases has been fixed at Basrah rates, as it has been thought that the conditions of service will approach more closely those of Basrah than of Maskat. I he rates for the boat tindal and the khallassies are somewhat cheaper than those recently applied for for Bahrein, but it is hoped that these cheaper rates will suffice, as there is not the same competition for labour at Koweit as at Bahrein. The expense at the latter place is due to the high wages paid for pearl divers. The door-keeper will not be required when a guard is provided. Water-supply is a difficulty at Koweit and for this reason it has been thought advisable to provide for a bhisti. 4. Passing from the actual proposals submitted, I find that there are one or two considerable items which it is difficult to handle at the present stage. I will take these seriatim {A) House Accommodation, Now that it has been decided to establish a Political Agency at Koweit j and that a certain amount of gossip has been aroused owing to the arrival of dis pensary and post office baggage at that port for the postmaster-designate, who is now in Bushire, it is advisable that the Agency should be opened without delay in order that time may not be given for obstructive intrigue on the part of the Turks to take shape. Under these circumstances it would be necessary, to start with, that the new Political Agent should rent a house or get on e lent him by Sheikh Mubarak. As soon as he is installed and has gained some local knowledge, he will be in a position to propose a site for Government quarters and make recommenda tions as to whether they should be built by local labour under his supervision or whether the work should be handed to the Public Works Department or a Government contractor.(B) Reception Room Furniture. For the time being, and probably for some considerable time, a suite of good Reception Room turniture would be out of place and likely to get spoilt, and provision has not there lore been made for it in the present estimates. (C) Guard. A havildar and 12 sepoys would, I think, be required for the Agency and Post Office which should be in the same building, if possible, but this is an item with regard to which political difficulties may arise and which will need special examination at the hands of Government. (D) Escort. A couple of mounted men to accompany the Political Agent when ridino out in the vicinity of the town (the only possible form of recreation for him) would be advisable to begin with and would give him weight in the eyes of the inhabitants. For travelling in the interior a mounted escort would, according to my experience, only be an incumbrance, as on such occasions the traveller cannot move without an escort of Arab Sheikhs in whose hands he has to place himself entirely and, while for protection one or two sowars would be useless, a larger number would only be a source of irritation and suspicion to the natives. Ihese two sowar orderlies should form part of the detachment of Bushire sowars who would, in future, be enlisted on a revised contract providing for their employment at Koweit, Bunder Abbas, etc., as well as at Bushire. At the same time, Captain Knox suggests the utility of a few, say four, locally enlisted levies mounted on camels on the lines of the Shutr sowars attached to Political Agent in Baluchistan. These men would have no uni form beyond a distinguishing head dress or belt; would provide their own camels and perhaps be armed with a Martini Henry carbine and a few rounds of ammunition, for which they would give security/ They would be useful as couriers when the Sheikh is residing outside Kow T eit as he sometimes does, and would also accompany the Political Agent on tours. 5 &amp; {E) Tours. A very moderate provision has been made under this head to provide for short trips in the neighbourhood in connection with work that may arise in the maritime vicinity. In Foreign Department letter No. 36-E. A., dated 6th January, the desira- hi.ity of our having more expert acquaintance with the politics of Nejd w^as discussed, and I am myself of; opinion that when the new Political Agent has been installed long enough to feel his way sufficiently, tours in the interior in the spring oi autumn should form a feature of his work. On such occasions, it would, I think, be advisable for him to adopt the course followed by the Political Agent at Maskat, namely, to submit with the report of his tour a bill for actual expenses for special sanction. I have provided for a simple field service camp equipage. I found that the use of anything more elaborate was impossible in Oman, and the same condi tions will probably exist in Koweit. (Fj Steam launch. The possibility of the provision of one being desirable in connection with the suppression oi piracy has occurred to me, but it is an expensive investment ■which Government may not care to embark upon to begin with, and 1 there- ioie merely mention the item for consideration in connection with the nature of the work which will be required of the Political Agent. 5.

I am directed hy the Secretary of State for India in Council to request that you will draw the attention of the Secretary of State for Foreign Adairs to the arrangements which have been recently made with a view to placing Consular appointments in Persia upon an improved footing, and for the representation of British interests at Koweit. As Lord Lansdowne is aware,* there lias hitherto been no provision in the cadre of the Indian Political t Se ^\7 nr « to a ,0&lt;11 m S t let,erS Department for the apj ointments of the 23rd March and 20th Ann! last. i-™ , . , , ,1' ,, at Bunder Abbas, Iver/nansliali, and Arabistan, which have been allotted to the Indian Service. This is also the case with regard to the appointment at Koweit, which lias been filled hy the deputation of Captain S. G. Knox, the First Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. The salaries, therefore, drawn by the officers holding the Persian appointments have been those of their military or civil rank, supplemented in the eases of Bunder Abbas and Arabistan by a local allowance of Rs. 200 per mensem, and in the case of Kermanshah by an acting allowance of Rs. 100 per mensem. No information has as yet reached this Office as to the salary at present drawn by Captain Knox at Koweit, hut it is probably that which he drew at Bushire, viz., Rs. 1,000 per mensem, including all allowances. In the ietterf from the Government of India, a copy of wh ch is enclosed for Lord Linsdowne’s t Xo. 2&lt;o (F. and C.), dated 2ist July ]n f orm ation, the Government of India propose to add to the cadre of their Political Department four appointments with a view to providing qualified officers for these four posts, vi z., a Political Agent, Secon d Class, on a salary of Rs. 1.500 pe r me nsem fo r Kouu fit^ two Political Agents, Third Class, on Rs. 1,200 each for Kermanshah and Bunder Abbas, and one Political Agent, Fourth Class, on Rs. 1,000 per mensem for Arabistan. In each ease it is proposed to add a local allowance of Rs. 200 per mensem. Under existing arrangements the increased cost of the Persian appointments would be divided equally between the Imperial and Indian Exchequers. With regard to Koweit, no arrangement has yet been arrived at between the Imperial and the Indian Governments. Lord Lansdowne will remember that, when the Agreement with the Sheikh of Koweit was originally concluded, Lord Salisbury stated* that “ he did not contemplate that bv t Sir T. Sanderson’s letter, dated 18th i• ii • * ji* T + iun( . ’ “ according that assistance the “ Indian Government would m the “ slightest degree pledge themselves to take any action or to accept any “ liability under any circumstances that might arise ia the future.’' The appointment of the Political Agent at Koweit is a direct conse quence of that Agreement; but, as regards the particular expenditure here involved, I am to say that the Secretary of State in Council is willing to accept as a charge on Indian revenues a moiety of the cost of the Agencv, so long as it is considered to be desirable to retain it. 1904. 'O' 15453. B1 The Government of India make a farther proposal, which has not previously been brought to Lord liansdowne s notice, viz., to have an officer in reserve to fill unforeseen vacancies in Persia, who should, when not required elsewhere, act as Assistant to the Consul in Seistan. Por this purpose they propose to add to the cadre of their Political Department a Third Class Political Assistant on a salary of Rs. 500 a month, with a local allowance of Rs. 100 a month, the' cost of which appointment would be divisible between the Imperial and Indian Exchequers. The monthly cost of these proposals appears to compare with the existing provisional arrangements as follows :— Subject to Lord Lansdowne’s concurrence, and to his consent to a moiety of the additional expenditure being home by Imperial levenues, the Secretary of State in Council proposes to approve the arrangements submitted by the Government of India for his sanction. I am directed by the Marquess of Lansdownc to inform you that he transmitted to the Treasury a copy of your letter of 29th September last, relative to Hie proposed tinancial arrangements for the maintenance oi the Consular posts at Bunder Abbas, Kermanshah, Arabistan, and Koweit.

No. 18,429/04. Treasury Chambers, 28th November 1904. The Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury have given their careful consideration to Sir Eldon Gorst’s letter of the 1st instant, relative to the proposed financial arrangements of the maintenance of the Consular posts at Bunder Abbas, Kermanshah, Arabistan, and Koweit, Their Lordships have been impressed by the number and cost of the proposals which have been put forward in recent years by the Secretary of State for India in Council in connection with the Consular establish ments in Persia. The additional annual expenditure agreed to on his suggestion since the beginning of the financial year 1903-04 (including that now in question) amounts, as they understand, to some 10,720/. (leaving out of account an annual increase of 2,957/. proposed by the Foreign Office). As these proposals have in the main been the direct outcome of the policy of His Majesty’s Government in Persia, my Lords have hitherto accepted without comment one-half of the resulting expenditure as a charge upon the British Exchequer; but the suggestions now put forward are of a somewhat different character. It is proposed to “ place Consular appointments in Persia upon an improved footing,” and for this purpose to incur an additional expenditure of 2,640/. per annum, of which half (1,320/. per annum) would normally fall upon the Exchequer. Out of this amount, a sum of 480/. (British share 240/.) is required to provide for “ an officer in reserve to fill unforeseen vacancies in “ Persia, who should, when not required elsewhere, act as Assistant to “ the Consul in Seistan,” the salary suggested being B,s. 500 a month, plus Rs. 100 as local allowance. The increased emoluments proposed at the remaining posts are equivalent to the following sterling sums, viz.:— — Salary. Allowance. Total. £ £ £ Koweit_ - 1,200 160 1,360 Bunder Abbas - &gt; 900 16o 1,120 Kermanshah - _ » . 960 160 1,120 Arabistan - - . . 800 160 960 Total - - 4,560 Add Reserve officer - 480 5,040 Deduct existing cost 2,400My Lords would ask the Secretary of State to compare these amounts with the emoluments of members of the Persian Consular Service under the Foreign Office, viz. :— — Salary. Allowance. Total. Tehran Vice-Consul - ‘ £ 300 £ 80/. as Local Superintendent of Works. £ 300 (? 380/.)

We desire to refer to onr despatches cited in the margin in which, when the 4th February, obtaining sanction to the three appoint ments of Captain Grey, Captain Gough, and Lieutenant Lorimer to the Consular posts at Bunder Abbas, Kcrmanshah, and Arab istan, respectively, we expressed the intention of addressing you shortly on the subject of a permanent increase to the cadre of our Political Department. At this moment we find ourselves with 12 of our Political Officers detailed for w »,n ^ ... — special work with boundary missions, or otherwise employed on duties for which no special provision is made in the cadre of the service. In ordinary circumstances, we should have been content to make such temporary arrangements as would tide over the stress of the moment, pending the completion of the scheme which we arc considering for reorganising the Political Department and incorporating the officers oi the Commission ot the North-West Frontier Province in the Department; but the present in convenience, which is likely to continue for an indefinite period is sufficiently grave to dislocate the arrangements for filling the^ posts m the Department within India; while we conceive that it is wrong m principle to undertake to supply officers to fill appointments which are not purely temporary from a department of fixed strength without adding to the cadre of that department. We desire, therefore, now to suggest that the posts at Bunder Abbas, Kermansha i, and Ahwaz may be added to the permanent appointments to be filled from our Political Department, and that, to this end, we should increase the cadre ot the department by 3 appointments of Political Agents, two ol the 3rd, and one of the 4th class, for Bunder Abbas, Kermansbah, and Arabistan, respectively. We propose to leave the Turbat-i-Haidari post for the present on its present footin' until it is known if a Consul is likely to be required there permanently , but we would add another appointment in the second class to meet Koweit, where, under the orders contained m your telegram, dated the 21th “Tune, 1904, a Political Agent will shortly be posted. These appointments are expensive and involve a very solitary life, so we propose to attach to them a local allowance of Rs. 200 a month on the analogy of most of the Consular posts in Persia.»&gt; II. DELE RICHARDS. 2. The proposal which follows is a corollary to the request we have made above, hut, if necessary, may be considered on its own merits. We have in the past frequently experienced difficulty in arranging for the relief of officers holding appointments in Persia, owing to the circumstance that comparatively few of our officers possess a knowledge of Persian affairs sufficient to enable them to undertake, at short notice, the duties connected with these appoint ments ; and the services of those who possess the requisite qualifications are, very often, not available. Wc consider it desirable to place this matter on a more satisfactory footing by posting, occasionally, junior qualified officers to posts in Seistan, Persia, and the Persian Gulf, subordinate to the Consular and Political Officers at present sanctioned. Eor the moment wo are not called upon to refer more particularly to the subject, except in its relation to the proposal that wo would now submit in regard to Seistan. For that district it is essential that the Consul should have time to devote to the affairs of Birjand which are becoming increasingly important; and, in order to enable him to do this without detri ment to his ordinary Consular duties, it is important that he should have an Assistant who, in the Consul’s absence, will bo able to carry on the current work. Further, owing to the great distances which must be traversed to reach such posts as Kerman, Seistan, Turbat-i-Haidari, and Meshed, serious delay and difficulty are caused in the event of one of our Consular officers in these places having to vacate his post at short notice. It, therefore, appears to us to be necessary to have one officer in reserve to fill such unforeseen vacancies. To meet this need we have posted Lieutenant T. II. Keyes, a qualified proba tioner of our Political Department, as Assistant to llis Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Seistan and Kainv 4. Since we arc convinced of the continuing need for an Assistant to the Consul in Seistan and for a reserve officer for the Eastern Persian Consulates, we trust that you will approve of Lieutenant Keyes’s appointment, not as a temporary arrangement, but as a permanent addition to the cadre of our Poli tical Department. The incumbent will ordinarily be in the grade of Political Assistant, 3rd class, on Es. 500 a month, with a local allowance of Rs. 100. As explained in paragraph 4 of Lord George Hamilton’s despatch No. 14 (Political), dated the Gth February, 1903, it will be necessary to obtain the consent of the Foreign Office to this proposal, and to the consequent permanent adjustment in the subsidy payable on account of the cost of Persian Consular establishments. 5. If you approve of our proposals, wc request that the Foreign Office may be asked to agree to a permanent re-adjustment of the subsidy, providing that the charges on account of these appointments shall be shared equally by His Majesty’s Government and by the Government of India.
