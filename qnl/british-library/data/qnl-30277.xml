ALI HD JAh , the iv ayor, who claimed to be an expert on rice cultivation and to know nothing and care less about municipal affairs, w,: s replaced by Dr. ABBASZADDH, the fomier head of the Health Deparment. There are many jobs urgently calling for his atten tion, the legacy of five years' neglect and Russian occupation* foremost is the rep ir of the city streets, which, apart from the two main avenues,are in shocking condition at present, it is to be hoped that t avam, after having personal and painful experience of the roads, will provide funds for their repair. 4* Another newcomer w„-s ALI A KB AH (AMIR V AFA 1 1) who came to hesht as head of Finance Cep? rtment. 6. For a while it w, s strongly rumoured that MCHAKDDS SIMwRGhD, who was for two years during the war Fayor of Be ht.wae to become Governor of iahlavi. Simorghe is an emigre from Russia,and s peaks the language perfectly. There is no doubjg that he is regarded with approval by the Russian authorities, but we have not yet acquired sufficient evidence to either support or refute conclusively the V accusation levelled at him of being a Russian Agent*~2~ Simor^ht is an astute and able man,who would not abate in from intrigues to further his ambitions. 6. The bi£ event of the month w. s the visit of the Prime iv-inister and the inisters of He 1th C Dr. and Agriculture (AmIK ALA 1 1) to Gilan. ^avam-es-oaltaneh spent most of his week's holidt^y at Lahijan,2G miles e st of Kesht, where he w^s visits i by numerous officials and by members of t e ijemocr t party On November 17th he came into 1- esht to attend a 7 Democrat partyrally in the municipal buildings. He later spoke to the large crowds which thronged the main square and gave him enthusiastic welcome. t avarn returned to Tehran on November I^th, and was 8 accompanied as far as ^azvin by Government officials On the direct order of the prime minister, Colonel 9 i AHLLVAN NLJAD, commander of the 29th infantry Kegt. stationed in Pesht, was appointed Governor of Bandar Pahlavi, and proceeded to remove many fussian stooges from positions of influence there. The Tudeh press at once set up howls of indignation -at this 'brutal treatment’'. Pahlevan hejad hopes that when the immediate job in hand is completed he will be al owed to return to his unit, and hand over the administration to a civil Governor. Apart from his spectacular purge of Tudeh officials, Pahlevan Nejad has annoyed the hussians in other ways. He has stationed troops on Pahlavi airfield, which is one over which the Kussians have been claiming monopolistic control. He has ordered the obliteration of Russian calligraphy on all shop signs,signposts etc. He hexs heckled the Russian Vice-Consul on small points of i procedure like the flyip*of flags ana the improper use of a diplomatic c^r number plate. And he boycotted a reception held by the local Armenian committee in celiebration of its 'National Day' because large posters of Lenin and *olotov were displayed. 10. H.1.m. the Shah flew to Bandar Pahlevi on November 29th, and lunched on board the royal yacht. It was his first visit since the occupation, and he received a great ovation. 11. election fever is,of course, now prevalent in the Reaht area. The Democrat party--2~ o €■ made excellent capital out of ^av&amp;m'a visit, but the rudeh party maintain a fairly strong: hold on the factory workers through labour unions, which flourish in the silk, cloth, tea, tobacco, jute, olive oil, fish canning: and flour milling indus tries. The Covernment is making great efforts to break their grip on industry,and has even gone to the lengths of moving whole sections of an industry-for instance the finishing processes in siiK manufacture- from Chalus to Resht in order to dislocate the Audeh party machinne and keep the factory under closer supervision importance is now attached to any party except the Tudeh and the Democrat. The ’Hezb-i-Jangal', which once offered such subborn oppsition to the Tudeh in this area, has now collapsed through internal rivalries and outside pressure from the Tudeh. The 'Hezb-i-lran”,composed principally of shcool students, has now formed a united front with the Tudeh. There is in addi tion an H Islami w party under the leadership of one of the •kollas* wh ich is likely to line with the Ifcwnocrat party* iv. According to Colonel hCGHBLLI, the officer commanding, the hesht Brigade is independent, dealing directly with the Ministry of «ar, and the plans for the formation oh an Uth (Gilan) Division have fallen through for lack of funds, fcoghbeli is an efficient officer, but his political activities are rather shady. He is over anxious to maintain good relations with the Russian Consul-General. 14. Brigadier ATAPCOK, one time Persian • ilitary Attache’ in London, spent six weeks in Resht recently, but not in any official capacity, he was busy with prblems regarding his estates. 15. The Goveraor-Ceneral of Gilan, ANSARI, returned to Resht on November I4th after a month’s absence, in order to be present during yt&amp;van.‘e stay here. Ke went back to Tehran on the 2cth November, but returned to Resht about a week later. Reports ofi hia dismiesal,circulated by his enemies, were thus proved to be at least premature.

The Acting Consul was present, but as it coincided with the period of mourning ordained for haji 3ayed Abol Hassan Isfcihani, the Chief 3hi*a Mojtahed , it was not attended by any Government officials of importance. There were some disgusting exhibitions of toadying by certain landowners, includ ing one MGJDbiHI, who is also prominent member of the husso-iranian ^u^tural society. The lavish sup lies of Vodka and cognac provided by the Russians inspired ilojdehi and his confederates to launch forth in fulsome praise of all things Russian.

Meanwhile preparations went on in Resht itself, in spite of considerable popular discontent, principally directed against HAoSAi. \KbAR and ARSANJANI. Two Mu Hag were put forward as the people ' s candid., tes, more as a^token of protest than as a serious attempt to oppose the Government candidates, which would be obvious ly hopeless. After polling actually commenced on January I7th a group ©f merchants and .ullas occupied the Post and Telegraph Office, taking Bast there, i.e. declining to withdraw until their demand had been satisfied. They succeeded in telegraphing te the prime inister and pretestirp against the conduct ©f the elections. *avam, however, only replied that ,! he could not interefere”. 8 . The following day, January ISth, remnants of the iudeh party combined with students of Iran party to stage a large protest meeting, against the elections, nfter the usual parades and harangues by demagogues, a mob tried to rush the Post and Tele graph office and seize the ballot box housed there.

PCLIIICAL 1 1 1 a (a) According to ^x^V. i .L.BhOWNING, the head of tha Aintrican iiiiiion, the youth of GILAN in general is digconttntod and openly turning to the U*3,o.P., and it doctrine a« affording the nearest resemblance to Utopia. The reasons given are:- the continued high cost of living,unemployment, corruption, and the Government's general lack of enterprise in all matters regarding reform. Little, if any , practical effort has been given to the promise of reform,either econo mic or social. (b) Official calls have been paid, and in most ca^es returned, on all local and foreign officials in K^SHT and PAHLSVI. Although here only three weeks, a few outstanding general impressionshave been obtained, which are considered to be sufficient importance to merit inclusion in this diary. Briefly, they are as follows Oue to the proximity of U.3.5.H,,Bussian influence in U1LAN has always been great, and is esoecially noticeable amongst officials. The Governor-Gener&amp;l # AN 3 ARI, appears to be very pro-hue^ian, and his subordinate officials naturally follow his lead, some willing ly and others through force of circumstances, with the absence of any thin; British for so long the populace in general has had no other alternative but to be pro-Russian in outlook and sentiment. The behaviour of the Russian occupation troops, particularly prior to their ev&amp;cation, when (having lived on the country) they more or less slipped it of everyth!n^ movable, even cown to doors and windows of barracks: recent events in AZAKBAIJAN: and the return of disillusioned refugees from U.S.3.R., have ail tended to lower Russian prestige. This, however, is kept alive by intensive propaganda, the distribution of films and the activities of the Eusso-lranian Cultural society (VGK«). In addition,receptions on a lavish scale are given by the Russian Consul-General as an additional method of impressing the local gentry.Phe pr«*#nt situation is that Eussinn prsstlf* 1 « lo» and consequently a temporary power vacuum exists. The opportunity should be sei/ej u0 iin this with something sound and healthy. One solution would appear to be an immediate lar ft 'e sctle extension of British Council activity throughout the rone of former iu»pian occupation. (c) One epontan«ou# request wa« made to H.i; .Consul by an official for an extension of British Council work. Tactful feelers to numerous people have elicited the fact that this would be welcome. A* a «hort-t*rm m policy thie 'showing the flag ' (in zones where the majority h»ve never seen it) and the practical demonstration of the British way and purpose of life should result in^apeedy gain of public prestige. Thinking Persians should soon know some thing' about the other side of the picture, and will then be able to judge and choose for themselves. As a long— term educational policy, the beneficial results are only too obvious. furti er attraction, to draw visitors to reading -room would be the regular local issue of bulletins of latest hot' news, ahead by two to three days of the ordinary newspapers received by post from TKHRAN. (d) Bailable sources report that disparaging;, remarks have and are being made in RfcSHT regarding the transport- a 16 cwt lorry- in which the British donsul drives. This i. compared with the saloon cars of the local Bus elan Coneul-C-eneral and also that of their Vice-Consul at PAHLEVI. The remarks and comparison made ere.unfortu- nsttly^NOT to our credit. It would help British prestige if this Consulate can be provided with suitable transport. (e) During the last week of April,Assyrians.Armenians and all others of non-iersian origin in BBSHT have had to report at • dice h. ,.., where their docur ents have been checked, names and addresses taken. This may be only a check on undesirable foreigners. Uiat U raay b * 8 ^ MT evacua- tlon^fro^i their present horrei 5 end re-distribution throughout PshoIAit) Confusing report# have been circulated rorarding an Incident on tb* 'rano-Ruaeian fronteir 4 kne &gt;' tat of AztASik on the rnorninp of 10th April, The correct official version, given on 2^th April to H # i:.Con#ul by Brigadier ^OOHBKLLI, O.C. Troope in GIlAH.ie as followe The body of a dead Rueeian «oIdler, a Jew aped about 22,wag found on the Rergian gide of the river, which congtituteg the frontier line. The body wag examined in the presence of Rergian end huseien immigration officers, the Persian Chief of justice and the military doctor. It was evident that death wag caused by a bayonet wound in the head. The next day a hu«»ian «oldier, armed with a rifle and light automatic, wag arrested on Persian soil about 7 tens lest of ASTAHA, fthen questioned, he stated that three Persian soldiers had created the Russian frontier, killed his friend for the sake ms of rifle,and then forceably took him back with them to Persian soil. While the Persians were drinking tea,however,he managed to escape. The Russian authorities demanded the return of their soldier, who wa* eventually handed back some days later, TTm* Russians declare that their soldier was killed by men of^Fersit-n army. Brigadier ^.OGHBPLLI, on the other hand,!# convin- r ced thrt this ii NOT correct. One reason,for example, is that the Russian frontier is far too closely guarded,especially by ni^ht (when searchlights are used), for any Persian soldier to risk hi# life on the chance of stealing a rifle. He ha# many possible explar -nations, but, of course,they are only eon^eettite. The Russians are not satisfied with the case and are demanding the removal of Colonel PAHLEVAN, C.C.Troops,ASTARA (see para 6 (i) of Diary for February,1947). In conclusion, the Brigadier said that there wag consider able intrigue even against himself. For example, he knew that anonymous letters had been sent to TEHRAN making absurd allega tions about his work and reputation. He stated that 'the Police ore behind it all' (see second paragraph of para 6 (iii) of Diary for February, 1947, regarding Colonel GHAFFARI, Chief of Police, RR3HT).Brigadier (XHBKLLl proniiaed that in future h« v.ould infold I; # 4 .,Conaul immediately rerardinf any event# of importance, #o a# to avoid the conaidereble delay experienced in the present case- the first report bein* only heard by chance on 17th April. 3&amp;CUKITY.

The Gcvernpr-Ceneral sated to H.B.&gt; . Consul that he had received many complaints regarding the present high price of rice, which is due to considerable Eussten purchases. He has, therefore, prohibited the export of rice from GILAN. The Russians have permit# to export up to 40,000 tons fro^t the present season*s crop. The Governor later corroborated to H.k.Consul the above i state of affairs, and gave the figure for Eussiin purchases as 35,000 tone. He stated that 40,000 ton* have been sent to other parts of IRAN, These two figures represent roughly one third of GILAN*S entire crop for one year. L ABOUR .

The Persian press reports that 'the Civil Aviation Department has decided to open three new aerodromes in RD3HT, RAiSAK and BABUD- SARf; also that the constructions of the Aerodrome at hj.3HT has been completed”.

Due to last minute ignorance of the SHAH^ route,all towns and villages between RiSSHT and l\Ak:Zhh had erected triumphal arches at considerable txptnct. As the 3HAH did not visit KAkdAR, this was a needless waste of money. In general,there has been adverse comment on the money spent by order on arches in IulSHT there were no less than 37 arches. In answer to a request to co operate in decorating windows .etc, the B.L.I.I;. kindly authorised us to decorate our Reading Room exterior.

The NAU SHAHR Security officer told the British •Consul that this Russian is frequently visited by Kuseisne from TJSHRAN and elsewhere* (h) . The British Consul accompanied by the Security Officer t walked all round the NAU SHAHR harbour. Details are as follows:- the two arms of the h?rbour fo out to sea about 700 yde. The entrance to the harbour from the sea is roughly ICO yds wide and has a small lighthouse on the Western aide. The chore breadth between the base of the breakwater arms is obout 400 yds end is open candy beach. There are 6 cranes and one floating crane in the middle of the harbour. Each side of the harbour has one quay with capacity of 2 sm^li «hipseach # with one small ship ir mid-herbour. The Eastern quay only is in use. Further dredging of the main channel and Western quay i s necessary before this latter can be used.Vessels up to I,ROC tons can use the harbour;the usual tonnage of ships is 800-900 tons. There is a small metre gauge railway,with trucks and motor trolly for use on both quays. Inside the harbour are 2,small stone warehouses used by.

This,iWlhl'explained, was the reason that he had purposely spoken to the ; ersian assis tant uiana, er in iront of the other TfihiiAN inspectors.beyond this, he was prepared to shut his eyes to the fact that British publi-^ cations were to be seen in several public institutions in ftfiSHT, knowing well that they contained nothin*- anti-Persian.

TOUR. The British Consul was on tour from 2oth-3lst October .during which period he was authorised to pay a liaison visit to the Consulate-General at ter,HAD, which proved to be of considerable value,3. i :3LJ.TAr(Y. 4^ on the morning of 3oth September .when proceeding to .•.UiUBiL t* fetch (see para X (a) of this UiaryJ, t)ie Consulate chauffeur reported considerable -nilitary activity m the form of a rtij^ery, machine-gun and rifle fire on the Russian side of the frontier between AST Ah A and the foothills. ;.6ny Persian troops were also encountered. On the afternoon of the same day f when coming from A.KDEBIL to I^'3IIT,iv:r.paiC^ reported that the Consulate car was stopped' a num ber of times by Persian military patrols on the frontier road, above mentioned, and his identity checked. He reported the presence of iersian trooos on the frontier,commencing from the top of the mountain pass,due West of A3I7'-R/.,to A3TARA itself. ( This confirms para c of our Diary for August,1947). His identity was again checked four times before reaching hiClHT,thus denoting considerable vigilance on the part of Persian officials in their attempt to keep a check on undesirable persons arriving, and departing'. c&gt;C OHOujXCS . In continuation of para 3 (a) of Diary for last month, information has been received from ivir.SINCLAIR, the new manager, that the merchants of RD3HT are very angry with AKSARI, the late Governor-General, for his completely incorrect statement to the Minister of the Interior regarding this year's rice crop. The merchants report that this year's rice crop in CILAK is interior in Quality,is 10-15 % below normal, and in price is roughly IOC * more expensive than this time last year. The cost of tea has also risen. Present prices in general will probably be increased later in the year.; 0 —4-- coaajKiCATiowr,. -'fien on tour-sec para s— the British Consul was able to confirm that;- (a) the road to BUJNUKD breaks off due West at the 77 km stone on the road KUCHAN»BAJGIRAK (distance 86 kn),i,e.,9 km due forth of KUCHAh.
