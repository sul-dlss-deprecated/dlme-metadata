It was copied in the 11th century AH/AD 17th in Ottoman Turkey. The text, on gold-sprinkled paper with tan tinted margins, is written in a variety of large-size scripts, including Thuluth, Muhaqqaq, Rayhan, and Tawqi', vocalized in black and blue. Illuminated rosettes with colored dots serve as verse markers.There is a bequest (waqf) statement (fol. 2a) in the name of Sultan 'Uthman Khan III (reigned 1168-1171 AH/AD 1754-1757), signed by Ibrahim Hanif, inspector of awqaf. The illuminated finispiece (fol. 7b) is inscribed with the basmalah and hamdalah in white Thuluth script in horizontal panels that frame a central lozenge containing Qur'anic verses in green and black Square Kufic. The binding of gold-sprinkled pink paper over pasteboard with central lobed gold-tooled medallion dates to the late 11th century AH/AD 17th or the 12th century AH/AD 18th. The fact that the flap is on the wrong side suggests that the manuscript may have been rebound at a later stage.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/11494", "Keywords": "Arabic; Binding; Book; Calligraphy; Codex; Illumination; Islamic; Manuscript; Ottoman; Prayer; Turkey", "Provenance": "Sultan 'Uthman Khan III, son of Mustafa II (reigned 1168-1171 AH/AD 1754-1757) [date and mode of acquisition unknown] [waqf entry in the name of the Sultan signed by Ibrahim Hanif, inspector of awqaf on fol. 2a and seals of the Sultan and the inspector erased]; Henry Walters, Baltimore [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": null, "Reign": null, "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2014-01-24T13:51:40.93", "Creator": "Abu al-Hasan al-Shadhili (died 656 AH/AD 1258)", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.578.binding_ClsdTop_DD_300.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.578.binding_ClsdTop_DD_300.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.578.binding_ClsdTop_DD_300.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.578.binding_ClsdTop_DD_300.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.578.binding_ClsdTop_DD_300.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1501112", "ExhibIDs": "112, 186", "Images": "CPS_W.578.binding_ClsdTop_DD_300.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not on View"}
