In return for this offering, the king was assured of protection and the power needed to maintain cosmic order, or <i>Ma'at</i>. He also received the gift of a uraeus for his crown, a symbol of the same forces embodied in the Eye of Re. The cycle of giving, receiving, and giving in return ritually affirmed that the king's possession of royal power was confirmed and renewed. </p>", "summary": null, "rank": 0, "label_date": "2008-08-01", "date_added": "2008-09-26 00:00:00", "approved_for_web": 1}], "artists": [], "collections": [{"id": 5, "name": "Egyptian, Classical, Ancient Near Eastern Art", "folder": "egyptian", "rank": 0}], "exhibitions": [{"id": 648, "title": "Egypt Reborn: Art for Eternity"}, {"id": 3329, "title": "Ancient Egyptian Art"}], "related_items": [], "geographical_locations": [{"id": 6863634, "name": "Egypt", "type": "Place made"}], "videos": [], "images": [{"filename": "CUR.36.838_wwg8.jpg", "id": 75277, "standard_size_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size2/CUR.36.838_wwg8.jpg", "thumbnail_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size0_sq/CUR.36.838_wwg8.jpg", "derivatives": [{"size": "0", "width": 52, "height": 96}, {"size": "1", "width": 104, "height": 192}, {"size": "2", "width": 208, "height": 384}, {"size": "3", "width": 417, "height": 768}, {"size": "4", "width": 835, "height": 1536}], "largest_derivative_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size4/CUR.36.838_wwg8.jpg", "largest_derivative": "4", "description": "West Wing gallery 8 installation", "caption": " <em>Ritual Object</em>, ca. 664-30 B.C.E.
