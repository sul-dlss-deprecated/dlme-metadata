Prior to 1900 India bore the whole charge, civil and mil it ary p of the Administration at Aden 9 In that year the Welby Commisaion reported that 'if the Empire were organised as a whole Aden would ba an Imperial charge 0 towards which the members of the Qnpire would ibu.,e 0 but in the absence of such an organisation another arranganent must be made and the equity of the case would perhaps be met if the United Kingdom were to contribute one half of the military charged (The civil charges, H aneuld be said 0 are comparatively insignificant; the expenditure is almost wholly military) 0 In pursuance of this recommendation it was agreed that from 1900 onwards a fixed annual ~ x conwribution of £72 0 OOO representing half the military expend ^ture on Aden 0 should be made by the Imperial Government (vide Treasury letter dated 11th September 1900 No 0 14137) in addition to the payment of half the capital outlay on special defence works 0 A Table is attached showing,, according to the latest information available in the India Office, the expenditure at Aden and its division between Indian and Imperial revenues from 1910 onwards 0 As the Imperial contribution has continued unchanged from 1900 and has not teen adjusted so as to accord with the heavy increase in the cost of the normal garrison since 1914 (the special arrangements made in regard to additional military expenditure during the War period having regard only to ~ been included in a payment of £00,000, made ^ ^e War Office, the balance representing a contribution towards the cost cl the India Office recomnended by the Welby Commission 0 J the2 0 the cost p shown in the Table under the head Aden operations, of military forces employed at Aden in excess of the normal pre-war garrison) India has, as will be seen from the Table, borne a share of the military expenditure on Aden much in excess of that which the V/elby Commission recommendedo When in 1917 it was decided to transfer political and military control to the Imperial Government the Government of India only .agreed to the continuance of the existing financial arrangements on the understanding that when revision took place the question of making it retrospective should be considered (vide Treasury letter to Foreign Office dated 11th June 1918 Noo 14686/104559 ) 0 The Secretary of State has since (in a private letter to the Duke of Devonshire) offered, in certain events,, to abandon any claim to retrospective adjustment prior to 1st April 1920o Any settlement must take into account the capital expenditure incurred by the Government of India on buildings at Aden, the amount of which is estimated by the Government of India to be 20 lakhs (say £130,000) for civil and 60± lakhs(say £400,000) for military buildings, these figures being exclusive of 5± lakhs spent on « temporary military buildings during the war Q In addition a sum of approximately £28,000 has been spent by the Government of India in providing a new station ship =&gt; the 'Lychnis* (now Cornwallis) - for Aden* The Government of India contemplate that the ship will be taken over by the Imperial Government if the administration of Aden should be transferred, in which case the question of a refund of the cost of the vessel will ariseo ItIt may be convenient to summarise the financial proposals that have already been made in connexion with transfer. In 1903 the Government of India (of which Lord Curzon was then the head) urged 'that the task of administering and guarding our naval base and coaling station at Aden and the adjacent territories^ which are necessary for its protection 0 subject to a contribution of £77 0 GOO a year from the Indian Government 8 may be directly assumed by His Majesty^s Governmento Financial and political responsibility will thus be united in the same hands Q in place of a system which exposes the Government of India to charges in the imposition of which they have had little or no voice while relieving the Home Government from the financial consequences of a policy the initiation and control of which have been almost exclusively their cm.* The figure £77 c 000 was a modification of the £72 0 000 payable by His Majesty’s Government under the Welby Commission’s report and the Government of India remarked that 'it is a far larger proportion than is demanded by the interests of India in the port and station' 0 but they were willing to pay it in order to be quit of all further financial liabilityo In 1917 the Government of India expressed the view that if Aden were to be completely severed from India 0 India could not thereafter be called on to bear any share of the cost; . but in 1921, on consideration of the Masterton-Smith Committee’s report, they were willing to make an annual contribution from Indian revenuesrevenues of £100^000;, subject to the clear understanding that this should be regarded as a final quittance,, and that His Majesty 9 s Government would then be responsible for all charges connected with Aden.; whether military or civil,, including subsidies to chiefs in the Protectorate 0 Later in the year Mr 0 Montagu, in agreement with Mr. Churchill, telegraphed a proposal that the Indian contribution should be 50 lakhs (say £330.000} a year for 5 years^ but the Government of India were unable to accept this, and explained that, oven if they were, the Indian Legislature would certainly decline to ratify the arrangemento The latest suggestion - which the Government of India have expressed their willingness to endeavour to pass through the Indian legislature ~ is that India 9 s annual contribution shouldbe assessed at one-third of the total civil and military expenditure. Taking the latter at £450,000, the figure of £150,000 nas been suggested, subject television after 5 years. An adjustment of capital expenditure, as indicated above, would also be necessary*</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000374_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/B378</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000374</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/B378</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Memorandum on Aden Expenditure'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1923/1923</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-03-10T18:33:47</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (5 folios)</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence for this description commences at f 31, and terminates at f 35, as it is part of a larger physical volume; these numbers are written in pencil, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file consists of a memorandum produced by the Financial Department of the India Office containing a summary of the civil and military administration charges for Aden c 1900 onwards.
