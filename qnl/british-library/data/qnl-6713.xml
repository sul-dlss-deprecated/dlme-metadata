This document is the property of the Secretary of State for India. Baghdad Railway. If we hold ourselves aloof and take no pnrl in the railway, the line will bo completed, at any rate to Baghdad, without ns. Our refusal or imwillingness to participate in the line will lead lo ill-feeling ugainst us. and to the consequent detriment of our trade iu those parts. Every official connected with the railway will bring his petty feeling and his influence to bear against our trade, and when this feeling is general it will be hopeless and too late to contend against it. Our trade in those parts will be ruined. Perhaps we can afford to regard this result with equanimity or indifference, but I think the outcry against the Government that allowed this to happen would be considerable, and would result in the alienation of much sympathy. If we hold ourselves aloof, we shall occupy, to a large extent, the position of the dog in the manger; we shall be mere obstructionists without the courage and most probably without the power to hinder the con struction of the line even to the sea-shore. We may be able to delay its progress and to thwart its objects to some extent, e.g., by occupying and seizing all the possible termini, but that will be a very undesirable attitude to adopt, and will probably bring on us retaliation in other parts of the world. Moreover, if we do not join it, the French or the Eussians, or both, may be induced to do so on exceptionally favourable terms, and that might result in a serious combination against us. With French, Eussian, and German influence combined against us in those parts we should find it very hard to maintain our position, and I do not think we should succeed in doing so. That the Germans will succeed in continuing their railway as far as they wish to continue it seems to me most probable. Their only difficuly is want of money, hut that is a temporary difficulty only, and, as the Kaiser and the German people—especially official Germany—seem bent on making the line there is but little doubt that means will be found for getting the money. We may, I think, take it as certain that the line will be made to Baghdad at least, and if that is so it seems to me that we shall gain far more by helping it and sharing in it than by any negative policy. S. 38. A2 There is only one condition, as it seems to me, that would enable us to hold aloof from a share in the line, and yet profit by it, and that is it we could secure the monopoly of the river traffic south of Baghdad on both the Tigris and the Euphrates (including the Hindia Canal). If we could do that, the railway would be a feeder to the river steamers which would 'then secure all the traffic between Baghdad and the Persian Gull'. The more goods tlie railway brought, the more would the number of steamers increase. And be it never forgotten that, especially in those parts, would the river-borne traffic eclipse and undersell the rail- borne traffic. I think that any one accustomed to compare the cost of river-borne and rail-borne traffic will bear me out in saying that river or canal-borne traffic is certainly cheaper though a little slower than traffic carried by railway. If, therefore, we secure the river-carriage we can afford to smile benevolently on the extension of the rail way to Baghdad, and the greater the number of the branches to the railway the greater will be our satisfaction, for there will be the more goods for the river steamers to carry. The railway, in short, will be directly increasing our trade. I beg to be excused for dwelling on this point, for it seems to me to afford a solution of all our difficulties. If w T e secure the river traffic south of Banhdad, not only on the Tigris but also on the Euphrates and the Hindia Canal, we are free from all responsi bility in connection with the railway, and free from all political combinations and their consequences. It is then immaterial to us whether the Arab tribes uproot the rails, destroy the stations, burn the coal stores, cut off the water supply, or do any other such mischief as upsetting the trains, robbing the mails, &amp;c. We shall be in a position to demand compensation from the llailway Company for any such losses, and shall also be in a position to enforce our demands by raising the rates of the river steamers. This monopoly of the river traffic seems to be such a desirable consummation as to be worth a high price, and the question is what we could offer the Turks or Germans to secure this. We might build for them at our expense good custom houses with proper wdiarves (badly wanted at present) both at Baghdad and Bussorah. We might build for them one or more permanent bridges (also much wanted) over the Tigris and Euphrates, at Baghdad, Musaiyib, or else where. We might offer the Turks some political guarantee that the railway should not be used at any time against their interests. I am not in a position to specify what we can pay them, but I think it might be something of a high value, for the control of the river traffic would be an increasing advan tage. Short of an absolute monopoly of the river traffic, we might descend to a practical monopoly under the Turkish flag, and failing that to a river- service in the name of the Sultan, taking over his steamers at a valuation and guaranteeing him a0 3 proportion of the profits. Lastly, it might suffice for our purposes if the rivers were thrown open to general trade. The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company would then seize their opportunity cf crushing all other competition and securing a virtual monopoly of the river traffic. If we do not secure the river traffic somehow, the Germans will do it (under their concession) when the railway reaches Baghdad or its vicinity. They will use their steamers to bring up material for the line, ai d once there the steamers will con tinue as trading steamers, and then the Germans and not the EngJish will have the monopoly of the rail and the river. This combination would first destroy the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Naviga tion Company and then the other English firms. The Germans have already started a service to the Persian Gulf, which shows that they are alive to the importance of this subject. Therefore if we do not share in the railway, we must secure all or nearly all the river traffic as compensation. I may note here that there is a certain a mount of traffic even now on the Euphrates and the Ilindia Canal; the latter from Musaiyib to Samawa is navi gable for boats of not more than 3 feet draught, and the Euphrates could be made as navigable though not quite as safe as the Tigris. Indeed, the river navigation is capable of much develop ment. The rivers would require a little training, a little blasting, and in places and at times a little dredging, but all this combined would not be nearly so expensive or so troublesome as the con struction of a railway from .Baghdad to the sea. The rivers exist, and are in daily use. The railway has yet to be made. The advantages of securing the river traffic seem to me to be overwhelming compared with the difficulties and consequences of joining in the railway ; but on the other hand the difficulties in securing the river traffic are also considerable. The Turks are jealous and suspicious of us ; I have heard it said that we are mal vus at Constantinople. They would probably be alarmed at and object to the idea of our controlling the river traffic, they would foresee annexation, or a protectorate, and another Ec?ypt. But provided we are willing to pay the price, I believe Sir N. O'Conor could arrange a bargain. To give us a concession for the navigation of the rivers south of Baghdad is, after- all, not more serious than to give the Germans the concession for a railway through the whole Turkish Empire ; perhaps not so serious. We were given this very concession in about 1841 or 18-12, but unfortunately it was not then seized, because we were hardly ready for it. It was, in fact, premature then, but might it not be secured now with the additional stimulant of a price or a consideration ? I do not think this is outside the limits of practical politics. The railway will certainly be made to Baghdad, and after that the goods will be carried by river to the sea. NowTfhat is to become of the river traffic? The Turks may wish to manage it themselves. They are incapable of doing so without European aid or supervision. At present they are mismanaging it, making little, if any, profit for themselves, but hindering the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navi- ^aiion Company from making their full 2 ) rofits. If we do not take charge of it the Germans will, and then we shall gradually disappear from the scene. Therefore, I suggest that we should cast about for some price wherewith to buy the control of the river traffic south of Baghdad and Masaivib. O * 2. The Hail way from Baghdad to the Sea.— I strongly believe that it will not pay to make this portion of the line, because it will not be able to compete with the river traffic, at any rate not until there is so much trade that the river cannot carry any more, i.e., until the Tigris is like the Thames, and Baghdad like London. That the line can be made as a piece of engineering is certain, because engineers will make a line anywhere if you give them enough money, but I think it will be costly whatever the alisrnment taken. From Baghdad to Nejf the line would be easy, and I would recommend that it should roughly follow the pilgrim route via Masaiyib and Kerbala, with a bridge at Masaiyib, or better still at the junction of the Euphrates and the Hindia Canal. From Nejf onwards the line, in my opinion, must go out to the west, because the country to the east is so extremely marshy and liable to inundation. I speak from personal knowledge. The country to the west is almost a pure desert, without timber or habitations, without supplies, and with but little water. It contains wandering Arabs who prac tically own no master, and they would probably give trouble to the construction and the upkeep of the line. They might be bought off and employed as line guards, like the levies in Baluchistan, but they are not nearly so tractable as the Baluchis, and would probably want far more money to keep them quiet. Still this could be arranged, and the line could be made to Bussorah, Koweit. or the sea. But it would not pay beyond Nejf. 3. From Urfa or Mosul to Baghdad. —This portion of the line would be quite easy to make, and I think it would pay. It would be certainly more profitable than the line from Nejf to the sea, or from Baghdad to the sea, because there would be no river competition (except on rafts for three months in the year), and it would be practically the only route for merchandise. The river is unsafe north of Mosul, and rafts are sometimes plundered on that portion of the river by the tribes on the banks. It is also somewhat but much less unsafe south of Mosul. In any case the rafts are slow and uncertain, and cannot compare with steamers as rivals to the railway. I think the line from Urfa or Mosul to Baghdad might pay after&lt;2) 10 years, by Avhich time the railway would have become established and familiar, and the local trade would have developed. Still 10 years is a long time to wait for interest on your money. 4. The portions that would pay are the branches from Baghdad to Khanakin (on the Persian border) and from Baghdad to Nejf, via Kerbala. The pilgrim traffic alone would make these pay, and that traffic would brinpr merchandise in its train. There is already a considerable transit trade from Baghdad eastwards into Persia, via Khanakin, and southwards to Kerbala and Xejf, and with these routes there is no river to compete. I know this country well, and can say confi dently that both these branches would be easy and cheap to make, and remunerative when made. Baghdad is commercially a strategical centre, and for imports it is the sea-port of that part of the world. Bussorah is to a large extent the sea-port for exports, especially dates, but imports only change steamers at Bussorah. At Baghdad, however, imports break bulk and change carriage. They are repacked in bales on mules or camels, and sent off literally in all directions, by far the larger part going eastwards into Persia via Khanakin. The Baghdad-Khanakin route is practically the only trade route into Persia. Some goods go from Baghdad via Balad-ruz and Mendali, but compara tively a small proportion of the whole. These branches of the railway, eastwards to Khanakin and westwards to Kerbala and Nejf would j)ay, and are in my opinion the only parts certainly worth securing, if we are to take any part in the line. 5. If we cannot secure the river traffic from Baghdad, I think we must take part in the line, and if so, what part ? Our trade and influence and prestige at present extend well up to Mosul. Therefore, 1 suggest that Ave should take the whole of the line (including all branches) south of Mosul. If we can get the exclusive construction, control, and management of this part so much the better, if not, let us get as much as we can. What are the best terms we can get? I would bring this portion of the line down the east side of the Tigris, through tlie fertile country of Birtella, Karakush, across the greater Zab (easily bridged), the lesser Zab (more easily bridged), to Altun Keupri, Kirkuk, Tez Khur- rnati, Kifri, Kara Tepe, Khauakin to Baghdad. All these towns are of considerable size with the exception of Tez Khurmati and Kara Tepe. (5. Summary. —I would try for (1) the exclusive, (2) the partial, control and construction of the line S. 38. B6 south of Mosal with all branches. I would also try for the exclusive control or partial control or, lastly, the free navigation of the Tigris, Euphrates, and Ilindia south of Musaiyib and Baghdad. •/ O And for these advantages I would offer a high priee, e.g. I would put down now enough money to complete the railway and its branches as far as Baghdad, with, of course, the additional stipulation that we should got the same interest on our money as the other shareholders, and that our control should at least he proportionate to our investment. 8. Details. —If we have the construction of the line we could use the opportunity to improve the custom houses at Baghdad and Bussorah. to build bridges over the rivers, and develop the communi cation generally. This would increase agriculture and tend to promote the settlement of the wandering Arabs. These might he given facilities for settling near the line and for guarding it. As regards guarding the line I would adopt or adapt the levy system of Baluchistan. This would bring the tribes into our pay and largely under our influence. The Resident at Baghdad should be given the payment of these levies, and in this way he would establish friendly relations with the tribes, and ultimately get much information and assistance from them in case of need. 9. Conclusion. —I have felt it necessary to be very brief, but I shall bo glad to re-consider or amplify any part of what I have written, if I can be of any assistance by doing so. My proposals are— {a) To secure the waterways, as far as may be, south of Baghdad and Musaiyib, and to leave the land line alone, because I feel sure the railway or land line will entail many difficulties which, though not insuperable, will be constantly troublesome. For example, if we take part in the land line, we may be involved in political complications with Russia, or Turkey, or Germany. Russia may object to our extensions, Turkey may he jealous of her internal sovereignty, and Germany may prove a greedy and intractable partner. Again, there would probably be difficulties in controlling the tribes in the neighbourhood of the railway, although we might pay them for guarding it. They might, and probably would, demand larger and larger payments, and if they failed to get them might destroy or injure the line. How to punish them for such conduct would be difficult, even if Turkey allowed us a free hand in dealing with them; it might be still more difficult if Turkey were to join us in coercing them. To employ military force, as seems to he contemplated by the Concession, would, in my opinion, be merely provocative, and I think, in that case, we should soon be engaged in a serious campaign against a general Arab risinir. The situation would he full of difficulties, and therefore I prefer limiting ourselves to the water-© s? r 5 ^ ways, for the use of which T would pay both Germany and Turkey a high price according to the extent of the control they would give us. T suggest that we should enter into partnership with the Concessionaires, leaving to thorn the land- line, and securing to ourselves the waterways, with, if possible, a separate concession from Turkey for our portion. I propose that the river steamers should be merely a continuation of the land line from Baghdad to the sea or to Bussorah, that they should work in conjunction with the railway, and lor this T suggest that we might advance to the Concessionaires enough money to complete their railway to Baghdad, including branches to Khanakin and iNejf. T would do this, if unavoidable, without guarantee and without raising import duties, but with the stipulation that on our total investment we should get the same interest as any other partici pator in the land line. If possible, I would keep the accounts of the water line separate, unless obliged to amalgamate with the land line in order to avoid being shut out altogether. (b) Ef we cannot secure the waterways or can only secure them to a much limited extent, and must in that case take part in the land line, I sug gest that we should go as far north as Mosal, in spite of all difficulties, rather than lose all.
