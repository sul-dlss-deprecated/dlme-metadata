India Office, 24tli July 1911. In continuation of previous correspondence ending with the letter of this Office dated the 18th April last, communicating copy of the Viceroys telegram of 13th April 1911, I am directed by the Secretaiy of State for India to enclose, for the consideration of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a letter* from the Grovernment of India submitting a draft of the proposed Order in * tti n , , 0 , Council for Bahrein. It will be * Foreign Department, Secret, No. 67, dated 8th June 1911 (with copy of Political remembered that, in view of the appended)?^ 0 28 ’ dated ^ April 1897 ’ local peculiarities to be provided for, that Government were requested to prepare the draft in the first instance. As regards what is said in the second paragraph of their letter, I am to observe that the Marquess of Crewe sees no reason to question the capacity of the Sbeik to divest himself of his responsibility of exercising jurisdiction over foreigners in his territory, or the effective ness for its purpose of the document that he has signed as between the Sheikh and the British Government. But the question still remains whether the jurisdiction could safely be exercised over subjects of foreign civilized powers without the assent given generally or in the particular case of the power concerned. On this point the Secretary of State will be glad to receive the opinion of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs before he proceeds further. The terms of the draft Order will, doubtless, receive the careful attention of Secretary Sir E. Grey, but Lord Crewe, as at present advised, sees no reason why they should not be agreed to, and he accepts the conclusions of the Government of India on the special points referred to in paragraph 3 of their letter. He would also suggest that, if Sir E. Grey sees no objection, “ the Foreign Jurisdiction (Admiralty) Order in Council 1910,” be extended to Bahrein, and the Political Agent be empowered to perform the functions of a Notary Public. Sir E. Grey will be able to judge whether this power will be best conferred on the Agent by the Order in Council or by separate notification. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient humble servant, (Sd.) R. Ritchie. The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. S. 85.| \J l*\ No. 67 of 1911. GOVEENMENT OF INDIA. FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. SECRET. j UN 1911 General. To ; v&lt;r, v my by \yy The Right Hon’ble the EARL of CREWE, K.G., Mis Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Simla; the 8th June, 1911. r k My Lord, With reference to Lord Morley’s Secret despatch, No. 11, dated the 21st May 1909, we have the honour to forward, for the information of His Majesty’s Government, the correspondence detailed in the annexed schedule in regard to the proposed Order in Council for Bahrein. 2. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has procured from the Sheikh of Bahrein a request in writing T%de enclosure No - 2 * that he may be relieved by the British Government of the responsibility of exercising jurisdiction over foreigners in his territory. We consider the document valid enough for the purposes for which it is required, as it distinctly surrenders all civil and criminal jurisdic tion over foreigners in Bahrein to the British Government. We, therefore, recommend that the Political Resident may he empowered to inform the Sheikh that following thereon, the needful provision has been made by His Majesty’s Government. 3. We also submit, for Your Lordship’s consideration, a draft of the proposed Order, and would draw attention to the following specific recommend ations made by our Political Resident ride enclosure No * in the Persian Gulf, viz. (а) the definition of the expression “ Foreigner ”, (б) the need for a set of regulations for Registration, and (&lt;?) the necessity for the Court of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf being constituted the “Chief Court” for purposes of Appeals under the proposed Order. As we agree in substance with the views expressed by the Political Resident the Order has been drafted to include provision covering the points detailed above. But in respect of the grant of the powers of a “ Chief Court ” to the Political Resident, in preference to subordinating the Bahrein Courts to the High Court at Bombay, we would, in drawing attention to the views expressed on a similar consideration in connection with Somaliland in paragraph 4 of Lord George Hamilton’s Political despatch, No. 28, dated the 8th April 1897, mention that the Political Resident will be instructed by letter that when exercising these powers he must hold his Court within the limits of the Order. Similarly the Judicial Assistant to the Consul-General for Pars and the Coast and Islands of the Persian Gulf, and to the Political ^ Resident in the Persian Gulf, to whom special powers are to be given, will hold his Court,2 * when required, within the limits of the Order. We do not consider that anv inconvenience will arise by the adoption of this course as it is not likely that either of the officers will be absent from Bushire together, or that they will be required to hold their respective Courts in Bahrein frequently. 7 .. . ,^? e Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has further intimated tlmi in 5 H //Tisable, if possible, to extend the provisions of « The Foreign . Juns ^ction (Admiralty) Order in Council, 1910 ”, to Bahrein.

(ii) Subjects of Turkey and Persia and other non-Christian Powers. (m) Dependents of petty Mohammedan Eulers on the shores or hinter- land ofthe Gulfs of Persia and Oman, such as the Trucial Coast Shaikhs and the Euler of Koweit, enjoying a greater or less measure of protection from the British Government. (iv) Natives of Katar or other semi-independent tracts not enjoying any measure of British protection outside Bahrein. Since the events of the winter of 1904-1905, ending with the Ultimatum to Shaikh Esa and the deportation of his nephew Shaikh Ali bin Ahmed, the protection or good offices of the Agency have been extended, when asked, to persons of all the above categories, and the usage has so far received the recoo*ni- tion and acquiescence of the Shaikh, that his officials are now in the habit of bringing members of them spontaneously to the British Agency for the investigation and adjustment of their claims. This development operates greatly in our favour, as enhancing our good name and influence among the trading classes of the Gulf and enabling the latter to obtain a measure of even-handed justice which otherwise they could hardly hope to get. J It operates especially in favour of the diving fraternity, an oppressed and deserving class, who can now count upon getting fair treatment at the hands of the Salifah Court, which, but for our good offices, would often be denied them. It will be understood, however, that under this comprehensive definition of the term foreigner, the onus of protection w r hicli has gradually been forced upon us and of which we can hardly now divest ourselves, becomes a somewhat heavy one, and necessitates in my judgment, the provision of a system of Eegistration for the restriction and control of it. On these grounds a set of regulations for Eegistration has been included, under w r hich a foreigner, wdiile in any case subject to adverse jurisdiction of the Agency when necessary, will not be entitled to claim it unless registered. In paragraph 2 of the Foreign Department communication under reply it was stated that reference to Eegistration had provisionally been omitted on the ground that the Political Agent does not exercise Consular powers, but as my opinion was asked on the subject, I presume that the application of regulations for Eegistration by a Political Agent is not considered wholly impracticable on any technical grounds. 6. The third fundamental modification which has been suggested and which needs explanation here concerns the quarter to which Appeals shall lie from the Court of the Political Agent at Bahrein. In this connection it will be noted that in my letter No. 76 of 25th February 1906 and in Government of India letter No. 1-G., 188 (Secret External) of 14th November 1907 to His Majesty’s Secretary of State, it w r as suggested that the District Court at Bahrein should he subordinate to the High Court at Bombay. The close examination of this question, however, from all points of view, has brought the Political Agents and myself to the unanimous opinion that it will be against the interests of the Bahrein community, and our political interests, that Appeal should lie to the High Court, and it is therefore hoped that the Government of India will see their way to recommend that the Court of the Eesident in the Persian Gulf be constituted the “ Chief Court ” for purposes of Appeals under this Order. I submit that the grounds in favour of the adoption of this course are cogent.4 firstly, it may be claimed under Article 4 of friendly Convention of 1861 with Bahrein, and by right of well-established usage since, that disputes between British subjects and dependants (now including foreigners since the Ultimatum of 1905), and Bahreinis on the _ other hand, are subject to the decision of the Political Eesident should the British Agent and Local Authori ties fail to settle them satisfactorily. Secondly, the general understanding prevailing among the Maritime Arabs is that the Besident is the Chief Authority empowered to settle all their disputes in the Gulf. Reference to the Bombay High Court with the contingent possibility of the Resident’s decision being upset will tend to lower the prestige of the powers of intervention which he exercises by dispensation from Govern ment. The High Court is greatly disliked by Gulf Arabs on account of the long delays involved in settlement of suits therein ; the heavy expenses entailed by the employment of Pleaders, and the practical impossibility for principals to attend in person. The distance separating Bahrein and Bombay and the slowness of communication would inevitably militate against the ends of prompt justice which is the only form of the commodity which the community appreciates. Great difficulty, expense and loss of time would be incurred by sending witnesses and parties from Bahrein to Bombay. In fact it would very often he practically impossible to obtain the attendance of witnesses. Appeal to the High Court might not be so fraught with objection were British subjects the only people involved, as the Hindoo Pirms often have representatives in Bombay, hut it is undesirable to force such procedure on Bahrein subjects and foreigners, and were it done, the native public would undoubtedly prefer the crude and uncertain jurisdiction of the Shaikh to our own. 7. In dealing with the section of “Bahrein subjects and Tribunals” it has been no easy matter to devise articles which will, wdiile locally workable in practice, be compatible with the exigencies of an Order in Council. I need only say here that the articles now suggested are the result of much deliberation between the Political Agents and myself and will, we believe, meet requirements. Respectfully commending the draft now submitted to the wise consideration of Government. $ vi | Enclosure No. 5 . Telegram, No. 357, dated the 19th April 1911. From— Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z.

I strongly advise equipment of Political Agent at Bahrein with powers of Notary Public either by the terms of the Order in Council itself or by separate notification pursuant to it. British subjects and European foreigners are steadily increasing in numbers^ and it (both) has proved in the past, and continues to he a great inconvenience to them that, whereas they cannot have Consular officers of their own to perform notarial functions for them either final or provisional, yet the British^ Gov ernment provides none. Such common requirements as the attestation of signatures to certificates of fact, &amp;c., are constantly required. ¥1907 .” (DRAFT) ORDER IN COUNCIL.

Political, No. 28. To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. My Lord, Proposed Somali Coast Order in Council. I have had under my consideration the Letter from yonr Excellency’s Government, No. 8, Eoreign, External, dated the 20th January 1897, with accompanying papers, relative to the proposed Somali Coast Order in Council. 2. Pending the completion of the negotiations entrusted to Mr. Eodd’s Mission, now on its way to Abyssinia, I am not prepared to take any immediate action in the matter. Meanwhile, how ever, I shall he glad to receive a more complete expression of the opinions of your Excellency’s Government upon certain matters to which I am about to refer, and upon any other points which may be suggested to your Excellency by an examination of the draft Orders in Council for the East Africa Protectorate and for Zanzibar, which were forwarded to India on the 19th Eebruary 1897, in Secretary’s Letter, No. 9. 8. The Memorandum of the Bombay Govern ment, forwarded with your Letter under reply, suggests that the exercise of jurisdiction within the Protectorate should be permissive, not obli gatory, and I understand that your Excellency’s Government do not contemplate any general control over the protected tribes; at a distance from the coast, by imposing upon them the jurisdiction to be established under the Order in Council. In this view I concur. But it appears to me question able whether, in the event of an Order in Council being brought into force, it will be possible to resist a gradually increasing demand for the exercise of British jurisdiction in the punishment of offences, the decision of disputes, and the redress of grievances generally. However desirable this extension of effective administration may be, in the interests of the people under our protectorate, it can hardly fail to involve a material augmen tation of expenditure. Before definitely adopting the system which the Order in Council would 5272. I. 555. ,introduce, I think it advisable to obtain the opinion of your Excellency’s Government on the question whether, from this point of view any limitations upon the eventual extension of the jurisdiction are desirable and can be practioa y maintained. 4. The recommendations of the Memorandum in regard to appeals also appear to me to require further consideration. It seems to me doubtfu whether the subordination of the Somali Courts to a distant authority at Bombay is expedient for judicial reasons, as well as upon considerations o± general policy. Your Excellency will observe that the East Africa Order already referred to provides that the Court at Zanzibar should exercise appel late jurisdiction over the Courts of the Protectorate, and I am inclined to think that in regard to the Somali Coast the Chief Court M Aden might be entrusted with the exercise of final authority over the Courts established in Somali Land. Possibly, if this were provided for, it might be advisable to improve the judicial status of the Aden Court, and to assign to the Somali Courts somewhat modified powers. Upon this suggestion I shall be glad to be favoured with your Excellency’s views. 5. The question of imprisonment also demands consideration, for it has sometimes happened that owing to tribal feeling it has become necessary to remove from the Somali Coast a man convicted of culpable homicide, and I think that some provision should be made for carrying out sentences of the Protectorate Courts either at Aden or in India. 6. Upon these and any other points which a perusal of the draft Orders in Council referred to above may suggest to your Excellency’s Govern ment I shall await an expression of your opinion. I have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) George Hamilton.draft telegram.

The reservation contained in the remaining words is an addition of the Sheikh's own. But as its effect is simply that such cases will be disposed of by the Joint Court, and gives Foreigners the same treatment that British subjects now receive, there seems no need for exception to be taken to it, and I trust the letter as now 2. The text of the letter down to the words 'foreigners only receivedreceived will be considered to suffice. If at an;/ time the procedure in regard to British subject is modified, by the same analogy foreigners would be covered by such modification. 3. The Sheikh* s indirect allusion to the Joint Court, however, makes it advisable for us to consider carefully in oringing out the Order in Council, the effect which the grant to the Political Agent of regular Civil Powers will have upon the working of the machinery at present employed for the disposal of Civil claims in Bahrein, and the extent to which those powers if granted need be published for the present. It would, however, be more convenient to go into this question with others when considering in detail the terms of the Order in Council, when its issue is finally decided upon. I have, etc., Sd.

I have, etc., (Sd) J. B. Hood, Demtfcv Secretary to the Govt, of IndiaUjcSb ' Secret, No. 11. India Office, London, 21st May 1909. To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. My Lord, The proposals made in Your Excellency’s Secret letter No. 188, Proposed Order in Council con- dated the 14th November 1907, for ferring on the Political Agent at regularising the judicial powers Bahrein jurisdiction over British exercised by the Political Agent at Bahrein, by the issue of an Order in Council placing both British subjects and foreigners under his jurisdiction, have been considered by His Majesty’s Government, in connection with the general question of the policy, political and com- meicial, to be followed in the Persian Gulf in order to meet the change in the situation consequent upon the development of the Bagdad Railway scheme. 2. The general conclusion at which His Majesty’s Government have arrived is that “ the competition to which British trade in the Persian “ Gulf is exposed is not merely commercial, but has a distinctly political object. British claims to political predominance in the Gulf are “ based mainly upon the fact of our commercial interests having hitherto “ been predominant, and should our trade, as a result of a German forward commercial policy, be impaired, our political influence would “ proportionately diminish. It follows that purely political action on our part, not having as its objective the development of material British interests, might have a prejudicial effect, both politically and “ commercially, by reason of the suspicions it would be likely to rouse.” 3. The proposals which you have made for the extension of the jurisdiction of the Political Agent at Bahrein fall within the lines of policy approved by His Majesty s Government. Their adoption would mark another stage in the development of the virtual protectorate which we exercise over Bahrein, to which the growing importance of the island as a centre of trade may be attributed. 4. It will tend to strengthen our position in Bahrein, and to remove usks of inteiference by other Powers, if jurisdiction over foreigners is placed in our hands. But our protectorate has never been formally notified, except to Turkey and Persia, and in the event of controversy arising with other Powers as to the assumption of jurisdiction overtheir subjects by the Political Agent, it will he preferable that our action should be based on a request from the Sheikh to be relieved of the responsibility of exercising jurisdiction over foreigners. When this has been arranged, an Order in Council can be issued. It does not seem expedient to make the Order in Council the medium of formally declaring a protectorate over Bahrein. Persian and Turkish claims to the sovereignty of the island have been repudiated by us in a form to preclude the necessity of any further discussion of the question with them. But neither Turkey nor Persia has formally abandoned its claims, and the Persian Government have not recognised, though we have consistently asserted, our right to protect Bahreinis in Persian territory. In the present political conditions of lurkey and Persia it is clear that we should scrupulously avoid any action that could be represented as an attempt to utilise their difficulties for selfish purposes. There is also the risk that the formal declaration of a protectorate might be regarded as a challenge by other Powers than Persia and Turkey, who might raise the question of our rights in a provocative form. 5. I request that the Political Agent at Bahrein may be instructed to approach the Sheikh, with the object of obtaining from him, as a necessary preliminary to the issue of the Order in Council, a request that the British Government will relieve him of the responsibility of exercising jurisdiction over foreigners in the island. 6. As regards British subjects, no difficulty arises in respect of the proposed Order in Council in view of the terms of Article 4 of the Treaty of 1861, and of the usage that has been established. 7. It will be convenient that the first draft of the Order in Council should be prepared by Your Excellency’s Government, with a view to providing for any local peculiarities that may require consideration.

My Lord, The proposals made in Your Excellency’s Secret letter No. 188, Proposed Order in Council con- dated tlie 14 th November 1907, for ferring on the Political Agent at regularising the judicial powers Bahrein jurisdiction over British exercised by the Political Agent at subjects and foreigners m Bahrein, -r, i • . P ^ , Bahrein, by the issue of an Order in Council placing both British subjects and foreigners under his jurisdiction, have been considered, by His Majesty’s Government, in connection with the general question of the policy, political and com- mercia], to be followed in the Persian Gulf in order to meet the change in the situation consequent upon the development of the Bagdad Railway scheme. 2. The general conclusion at which His Majesty’s Government have arrived is that “ the competition to which British trade in the Persian “ Gulf is exposed is not merely commercial, but has a distinctly political “ object. British claims to political predominance in the Gulf are “ based mainly upon the fact of our commercial interests having hitherto “been predominant, and should our trade, as a result of a German “ forward commercial policy, be impaired, our political influence would “ proportionately diminish. It follows that purely political action on “ our part, not having as its objective the development of material “ British interests, might have a prejudicial effect, both politically and “ commercially, by reason of the suspicions it would be likely to rouse.” 3. The proposals which you have made for the extension of the jurisdiction of the Political Agent at Bahrein fall within the lines of policy approved by His Majesty’s Government. Their adoption would mark another stage in the development of the virtual protectorate which we exercise over Bahrein, to which the growing importance of the island as a centre of trade may be attributed. 4. It will tend to strengthen our position in Bahrein, and to remove risks of interference by other Powers, if jurisdiction over foreigners is placed in our hands. But our protectorate has never been formally notified, except to Turkey and Persia, and in the event of controversy arising with other Powers as to the assumption of jurisdiction over s. 9.I their Subjecfs b\f the Political f\gent : &lt;t will be f&gt;refevab&lt;e that ouy cxchon sboolD be Ix\seS {hot on 05xofe which may be disputed bufjon a request jvow ibe Sheikh lb be relieve 1&gt; of ihe resf&gt;c,ns('t&gt;//ity of eferci'stng jU'rt.r 0 (c bon ovev foyeigoers. \fl(hen fL&lt;s has beev arra acjed / a/\ Order l K G&gt;ijr\Ci( can be issued ( jjhe jprea/Y\ble of which \s&lt;K recihe fAc c^cuf^rfbACri' in which traa^fer of jurisdiction has been nr\do\Il' does not seem expedient to make the Order in Council the medium of formally declaring a protectorate over Bahrein. Persian and Turkish claims to the sovereignty of the island have been repudiated by us in a form to preclude the necessity of any further discussion of the question with them. But neither Turkey nor Persia lias formally abandoned its claims, and the Persian Government have not recognised, though we have consistently asserted, our right to protect Bahreinis in Persian territory. In the present political conditions of Turkey and Persia it is clear that we should scrupulously avoid any action that could he represented as an attempt to utilise their difficulties for selfish purposes. There is also the risk that the formal declaration of a protectorate might he regarded as a challenge by other Powers than Persia and Turkey, who might raise the question of our rights in a provocative form. 5. I request that the Political Agent at Bahrein may be instructed to approach the Sheikh, with the object of obtaining from him, as a necessary preliminary to the issue of the Order in Council, a request that the British Government will relieve him of the responsibility of exercising jurisdiction over foreigners in the island. IrnAjf Ki J 6. As regards British subjects, no difficulty arises in respect of the proposed Order in Council in view' of the terms of Article 4 of the Treaty of 1861, and of the usage that lias been established. 7.

With a view to define and regularise the powers exercised over British subjects by the Agent, the Political * rwe paragraph e of enclosure No. 5. Resident in the Persian Gulf* has put forward the suggestion that he should be appointed to be a Justice of the Peace and endowed with the powers of a District Judge in direct subordination to the High Court of Bombay. We concur in this recommendation, but with reference to clause 2 of the Indian Foreign Jurisdiction Order in Council, 1902, we under stand that it would first be necessary for Bahrein to be declared by His Majesty in Council to be a territory in which jurisdiction is exercised by, or on behalf of His Majesty through the Governor-General in Council. We would accordingly request that, if His Majesty’s Government see no objection, the necessary Order in Council may be passed providing for the exercise of jurisdiction in Bahrein. 4. But, further, in view of the increase of foreign shipping and foreign interest generally in the Gulf, and of the establishment of foreign firms and missions in Bahrein, which has already caused practical difficulties, it seems desirable that, if possible, in maintenance of the status quo in the Gulf, provision should be made in the Order in Council for the exercise by the Political Agent of jurisdiction over foreigners in Bahrein, before foreign interests have so largely developed as to render the assumption of the legal duties of a protecting power a matter of greater intricacy and difficulty involving perhaps, as in the case of Zanzibar, diplomatic representations to foreign powers.

He reports that the fees leviable for the ser- vices thus rendered would have amounted to £8-17-6 according to the scale ot uonsuiar tees, had he possessed authority to levy such fees. 2. So far as the issue of hills of health, noting of Marine protests, etc are concerned, such acts can only be performed by officers possessing Consular rank, which the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein, does not possess, and with which, m view of the political status of Bahrein, it will probably be incon- vement to invest him. I do not, however, anticipate that much inconvenience will be experienced on this account, as the number of direct merchant vessels calling at Bahrein is not large. The mail steamers and most of the other mer chant vessels which call at Bahrein also visit Bushire, where application can be made for the performance of duties required under the Merchant Shipping Act It wiH be better therefore, I think, that the Assistant Political Agent should in future inform masters of merchant vessels, who make applications to him, that he has no authority to perform duties of a Consular nature. 3. With regard to duties of a notarial nature such as the legalization of signatures, execution of powers-of-attorney, and other acts which mio-ht be required of a Psotaiy Public, I think that it may be advisable that the Assistant Political Agent should be appointed by notification in the Gazette of India under the Negotiable Instruments Act, XXVI of 1881, to be a Notary Public for the islands of Bahrein, and authorized at the same time to levy fees to he credited to the Government of India, in accordance with the scale of fees levied under the provisions of the Persian Coasts and Islands Order in Council. 4 With regard to the issue of passports, I propose to instruct the Assistant Political Agent to forward any applications which he may receive to me for disposal.

Kemball, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 7, dated the 16th January 1902, requesting that the Assistant Political Agent, at Bahrein may be appointed to be a Notary Public for the islands of Bahrein. 2. I am to point out that the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (XXVI of 1881), under which you propose to appoint Mr. Gaskin to be a Notary Public, has not been applied to Bahrein, and that there is not at present any authorised procedure by which it can be brought into general operation there. Moreover, the appointment of Mr. Gaskin to be a Notary Public under the Act would only constitute him a Notary Public for the purposes of that specific enactment, and would not authorise him, as you apparently suppose, to do such other acts as might be required of a Notary Public. Special provision has been made by the Commissioners for Oaths Act, 1889 (52 Viet., c. 10), section 6, for the perform ance of Notarial acts in foreign countries by diplomatic and Consular officers of His Majesty, and, though the law both in England and in India recognises certain acts of Public Notaries appointed by foreign authority, it is inexpedient to rely upon such authority for the appointment of a diplomatic officer of a class not specified in the statute. 3. In the circumstances above explained, it is a mitter for consideration whether the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein should not be invested withConsular powers which would enable him to perform the funchons of a Notary Public bv virtue of his office and, if you think that there is sufficient justifica tion for the grant of such powers, the Government of India will be prepared to consider any proposal which you may make to this effect. 4 The Government of India are aware that the peculiar status of Bahrein may possibly render the investment of Mr. Gaskin with Consular powers a somewhat anomalous proceeding, but they are disposed to think that no practical difficulty need be apprehended from the step, and that there may be advantages in providing for the exercise of power and jurisdiction over His Majesty’s European subjects and others in Bahrein and on the southern shores of the Persian Gulf by an Order in Council similar to that which has been framed for Maskat and for the Persian Coasts and Islands. The Governor-General in Council will, therefore, be glad to be furnished with your opinion on this proposal, together with any alternative suggestions which you may have to offer. No. 10-S.A.., dated Shiraz, the ’Znd July 1902. Prom Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 914-E.A., dated 6th May, in which, after pointing ont the impracticability of the proposal submitted by me for the investment of the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein with certain notarial powers, yon say that it is a matter for consider ation whether the Assistant Political Agent should not be invested with Con sular powers which would enable him to perform the functions of a Notary Public by virtue of his office. 2. In my opinion, considering the requirements of Bahrein and the nature of our representation there, it is not necessary nor advisable that the Assistant Political Agent should have more than Vice-Consular rank, which could, as in the case of the Vice-Consul at Bushire, he conferred on him by warrant of the Consul-General at Bushire. At present, however, the Consular jurisdiction of the Resident at Bushire does not extend beyond the Persian side of the Gulf and the islands appertaining thereto, and although the question of Consular jurisdiction for Bahrein and the Arabian Coast of the Gulf was considered at the time when the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council was drafted— paragraph 5 of the Despatch No. 110-External, dated 22nd July 18S7, from the Government of India, to the Secretary of State for India—it is not clear to me whether at that time the issue of a separate Order in Council for that side of the Gulf was contemplated. The simplest solution of the question would be to extend the Resident’s Consular jurisdiction in the required direc tion without the issue of a separate Order in Council. He could then issue a warrant appointing Mr. Gaskin to he Vice-Consul at Bahrein. Mr. Gaskin would thus he enabled by virtue of his office to perform the functions of a Notary Public, and the powers conferred upon him would, for all the present practical requirements of Bahrein, be ample. If, however, a separate Order in Council is required, it should, I think, be framed with a view to extend the Resident’s Consular jurisdiction and not to create a separate and independent Consular appointment as at Maskat. 3. At the same time, I am inclined to doubt whether the requirements of the case justify the issue of a separate Order in Council to provide for Consular jurisdiction at Bahrein and the other places in the Gulf not already provided for by Orders in Council. The Assistant Political Agent is already invested with magisterial powers in criminal cases over British Indian subjects, and there are at present no European British subjects at Bahrein. The want, therefore, of Consular jurisdiction has not hitherto been felt to any appreciable extent, and the object of my letter No. 7, dated 16th January, was merely to suggest that notarial powers should he conferred upon the Assistant Political Agent so as to enable him to perform certain notarial functions and levy fees for so doing. As a matter of fact, Courts in India are not, I think, likely to dispute the validity of the Assistant Political Agent’s attestation of 26 ) thfw entS and the ofthB levy of fees is not of much importance. If, n^ A o£n* 1-fn n ate i rder ''i C i &gt;un0ll 1 is required to invest the Assistant Politi- * T l ^. nSU /. ar r c ank ’, 1 am deposed to think that there is at present no sufficient justification for the measure. ^ . 4. In connection with the extension of Consular jurisdiction to Bahrein it is I think, necessary to bear in mind that although we have an agreement with the Chief of Bahrein whereby Foreign Consuiar Agencies cannot be es. tahlished m Bahrein without the consent of the British Government, it mav perhaps he inconvenient to maintain this position in the event of British Con sular 3urisdiction being extended to Bahrein. The German Consul at Bushire informed me once in course of conversation that he considered his jurisdiction in the Gulf to extend wherever mine did, and I think he said that his instruc tions from his Government were to this effect. This point has not of course escaped the notice of the Government of India, but I mention it so as to make my present report as complete as possible. G. c: B. P., Simla -No. C.-471 F.

In the first place, I may mention that at the end of October last. Dr. .Listemann who had then recently taken over the duties of German Consul at Busmre, spoke to me informally on the subject of the position of German subjects m Bahrein. He began by saying that he understood from the corres pondence on his records that the Residency would take exception to his addressing Sheikh Esa direct on behalf of a German subject in Bahrein. I replied in the affirmative, on the grounds that the foreign relations of the Chief were in our hands. He then went on to enquire what amount of pro tection we shouW consider it possible to afford to German subjects trading in Bahrein. I rejoined that my instructions were that we should always give European foreigners our good offices as a matter of courtesy, and that, if necessary, thej should receive the same amount of protection as if they were British subjects, as had Mr. Bahnson at the time of the attack on him. As regards the commercial claims of European foreigners, I expressed the opinion that in ordinary cases it would be in their interests to endeavour to get justice from the Sheikh direct in the first instance, and that if this course failed they could then ask the good offices of our Agent. Reference was then made to the majlis or permanent committee of respect?* able native merchants appointed for the settlement of commercial disputes, which is a feature of the administration of justice in Bahrein. Dr, Listemann’s idea seemed to be that the interests of European merchants might be prejudiced by bring submitted to the arbitration of a purely native tribunal, I informed him that speaking from memory I believed that the majlis in such cases usually sat at the Agency, under the supervision of the^ Political Agent, and that ordinarily I thought that the finding of the majlis would be subject to his concurrence. . 0° conclusion of the conversation, my colleague said that he had been asking for personal enlightenment as a new comer, and since then I have heard no more from him on the subject in question. 3. The question of the formation and status of this majlis has recently been brought into some prominence in connection with the case of claims against the estate of one Seyyid Khalaf, deceased, with regard to which I have addressed the Government of India in my letter No. 75 of to-day’s date, Search has been made in the Bushire records for any correspondence throwing light on the origin of this tribunal, but nothing has up to the present been found, nor does it appear that it was an arrangement introduced specially at the instance of the Residency, nor that the Resident has hitherto exercised any revisionary powers over it. The institution seems to have been developed automatically in the days of our Native Agents and to have, up till recently, fulfilled its purpose quietly and adequately, I attach a memorandum on the subject compiled from some iucidental references to the subject in communi* cations received from our present Political Agent.4 With reference to the position of Foreign European merchants in Bahrein, I learn from Captain Prideaux that the four representatives of the German firm of which Herr Wonckhaus is the principal, are still in the habit, when in conversation with him, of harping upon their claim to extra territoria- lity in Bahrein both in regard to criminal and commercial matters. Captain Prideanx considers in fact that they would definitely refuse to go before the Sheikh’s tribunals, and that if we were to say that this majlis with local merchants sitting on it, and the British representative supervising the finding is a Territorial Court, they would perhaps object even to that. H, on the other hand, we say that the majlis is a Court which the Protecting Power in consultation with the Chief has evolved for the settlement of dis putes in which British subjects or Europeans claiming our good offices are concerned, it would seem to afford them an opening for asking us to define our position more precisely. For present purposes X asked the Chief informally at my interview on the 14th insiant to agreeXp that pending any further communication between us on the subject, findings come to by the ntajUs sitting at the Agency should he considered as subject to modification by the Political Agent in consulta tion with himself, Sheikh Esa, in the event of the European foreigner concern- ed not being satisfied with the settlement made by the majlis. I trust that pending full consideration of the subject, the Government of India will approve of this arrangement. 5. The present position being as described in the foregoing paragraphs, the Government of India will perhaps concur with me in thinking that the question of the administration of justice in Bahrein at the present time requires to be placed on a more precise footing, both in view of the gradual influx of Europeans into the island, and of the modified situation brought about by the appointment of a fully qualified gazetted officer of the superior status to represent our interests. 6. In connection with the question of the judicial position of the latter, I beg to refer to the correspondence ending with Colonel KembalPs letter No. 10°S.A., addressed to the Foreign Department on 2nd July 1902, on the subject of the appointment of the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein to be a Notary Public, and would ask that the question of the issue of an Order in Council for Bahrein may again be taken into consideration. If it is thought necessary to give our representative Consular status for duties in connection with merchant shipping, then perhaps the terms of his appointment in that capacity might nominally refer only to Katr and Katif, and not to Bahrein. As regards Bahrein, it would seem most convenient that he should be appointed a Justice of Peace and endowed with tbe powers of a Subordinate Judge with appeal to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, or with those of a District Judge in direct subordination to the High Court of Bombay. As, however, tbe precise nature of tbe powers which it is necessary to give him and the manner in which it should be done, is inseparable from the larger question of our own relations in regard to Bahrein, it seems advisable for me at this stage merely to commend tbe subject to tbe wise consideration of the Government of India in conjunction with the other questions affecting Bahrein which I am now reporting upon. Memorandum regarding tbe Bahrein mnjlis or permanent Native Court of Arbitration, dated 25th February 1906. For the last 49 years or more it has been customary here, when commer cial disputes have arisen between British subjects or proteges on the one hand and Bahrein subjects or persons of any other nationality on the other, for the British Agent, first Native and subsequently English—to assemble a Court of Arbitration, locally called a mailis formed from a body of respectable persons 2whose names are borne on a permanent list for the hearing and adjudication of the case. This practice at its origin received the assent of the Chief and the list includes a number of the most influential Sunni, Shiah, and Hindu Indian merchants of Bahrein. The Court has always had six permanent members and a few waiting members called in occasionally when any of the permanent members are sick or away from Bahrein. The six permanent members at present are— 2 Bahrein subjects (one Sunni and one Shiah). 2 Arabs of Nejd. 2 British Indian Hindus. When the services of the majlis are required it has not been the invariable custom to refer each time to the local authorities, as no person sits in the Court in a particular case whose presence is objected to by either party, and although a munshi of the Chief’s does sometimes attend at the request of one party or the other for the purpose of watching the proceedings, such is not always or necessarily the case. No doubt, however, if a witness refused to attend, it would be necessary to invoke the Sheikh’s assistance, but in practice this difficulty has never occurred. The services of this majlis are frequently invoked for the settlement of disputes between British subjects and between parties of different nation alities, and then it assembles at the Agency unless given special permission for purposes of convenience to assemble elsewhere. The Sheikh also refers to it occasionally cases between Bahrein subjects which he finds it inconvenient or difficult to settle off-hand himself. The reputation of the majlis locally is exceedingly high, and it does not appear that the Residency has ever interfered with or quashed its decisions which are usually in the nature of a compromise. During the last year only one case has come under the Political Agent’s notice in which the settlement of the majlis was not accepted without demur. In that instance the Political Agent re-assembled the Court, as the objector alleged that the whole of his evidence had not been examined, and finding the objection frivolous confirmed the Court’s decision. The position of the Political Agent towards the Court hitnerto seems to be more analogous to that of a Judge Advocate than a Court of Appeal. Where none of the litigants were British subjects or entitled to British protection he has really no locus standi, but yet under the peculiar circumstances of the case, principles may often be involved which affect the interests of the whole community. The litigants themselves have no right to nominate the members of the Court in their particular suit, but the interests of both parties are carefully considered in this regard, and the members selected either by the Chief or the Political Agent or by both in consultation according to the varying circum- stappes of the case. (s' &gt; 2 ^ No. 516 (Confidential), dated Bushire, the 4th (received 13th) March 1906. From—M ajor P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to submit the report called for in Foreign Department telegram No. 972-E.B., dated 1st March, together with an expression of my views as to the most convenient method of dealing with a member of the Persian community in Bahrein who has committed an offence on board a British ship in Bahrein harbour. 32. A copy of the Political Agent’s original report is enclosed. It treats of two distinct cases, with regard to the Bahre., No. 46, dated 26th January 1906. firgt&gt; of a reference wag made to the Government of India by telegraph on 19th February. At the time I received Captain Prideaux’s communication I was expecting to visit Bahrein a few days later and preferred to discuss the cases further with him before taking specific action on his report. 3. Under the older order of things the disposal of neither case would have presented much practical difficulty, but the critical vigilance of foreigners and agents of foreign representatives at the present time makes it advisable for us to shape our procedure as far as possible on lines which will pass hostile criticism should any be offered, and I therefore treated the present cases with some caution. Several possible solutions were discussed between the Political Agent and myself, but everyone carried with it some objection either local or legal, and I came to the conclusion that it would he best to refer both cases to higher authority on tbe broader issues involved and on receipt of instructions to carry them out as far as tbe local conditions admitted. I am now desired to submit a fuller report with my own views in respect of the case in which a Persian subject is concerned. 4. Primarily three alternative courses seem to admit of consideration (i) That the Political Agent should place the results of his preliminary enquiry before Sheikh JEsa and let him punish the man. From tbe correspondence leading up to the Ultimatum which was presented to Sheikh Esa last year in connection with the attack on Mr. Bahnson and on the Persian community, respectively, I gather that we have^ not definitely withdrawn the Persians in Bahrein from the Sheikh’s jurisdiction in ordinary matters, but have contented ourselves with asserting our right to interfere save th erri or any other persons not subjects of the Sheikh from oppression. If this he the correct view, there would be no primary objection to course (1). On the other hand, v there are attendant difficulties which Captain Prideaux mentions m paragraph 6 of his letter, and it is, moreover, probable that if the Persian were handed over to Sheikh Esa without any definite pronouncement of our decision in regard to the exercise of juris iction over Persians generally, the remainder of the Persian community would take alarm at this course and report the matter to their Government. («) The Persian might be forwarded to the Bushire Besideney with a statement of the case and might be handed over to the local Persian authorities at JBushire for disposal. Ihe Political Agent is averse to this course if it can he avoided for the reasons stated by him. ^ Apart from the latter the procedure has to be considered in its bearing upon the discussion which is now progressing between the representatives of the British and Persian Governments in Tehran or London, and it seems chiefly a question for the consideration of His Majesty’s Government as to whether this course would inconvenience them in any way. It would in any case bean indirect pronouncement to the effect that Persians were withwrawn altogether from the jurisdiction of the 1 Bahrein, and also were not justiceable in criminal mat ers by the British representative; and such a ruling would embrace the case of all foreigners in Bahrein. 4^ 5 to Ms 4 -l- r ° Sk the prisoner */ he consents to submit and 3Un l 7 l °7' md ^ he dnes he might be forttecith sentenced and punished under the Political Agent’s supervision. The the mere asking of the question would put right to deal with i n ' U S1&lt; T 1 -f ,' at t lei ' e was some doubt as to our r gut to cleat with him, and if he were subsequent!v ac-rrieved lw ^o hTs^t 1 - ted t° n him ’, “ W ° Uld P^bally oceuf S to him o^ auaoritie here r DS t0 C T P a 'S t0 Bushira - Moreover, the local autlioiities here have agents in Bahrein who report evervthino- to them which passes.

'' a - v - It; I s U^r, however, that the powers of our Political Agent need putting on a more satisfactory basis than they are at present, and I have addressed the Government of India on this subiect in a recent communication, No. 76 of 25th February 1906.

It only remains, letw w L i • C °, r,eur “ tbe ^commendations contained in this letter foi me to issue the judgments and senteuces. tiiis, however, I think that it is necessary for me to sub- ^• 1 ii • 10 0 observations on the general position in such criminal cases . l n . m y , P ltlc al jurisdiction, and also briefly to invite attention to the pom s in w nch the two cases that have arisen differ from each other. 4. In the sailing-boat case, though the vessel is registered in India and tRe owner is a British subject, the crew are all inhabitants of Gwadar, and presumably therefore subjects of Maskat : they are Baluchis in nationality. e consignee is a Bahrein subject, and the offence was first brought to my cognizance by the Chief of Bahrein, who formally requested me to deal whh 1 ‘ ,, , ? no ^ P ro P°se to sentence the accused to a term of more than six months imprisonment, and as arrangements can be easily made for the enforce- ment of this punishment with hard but useful and productive labour in .banrem, 1 venture to express the opinion that no considerations of any special intricacy affect this case. ^5. In the other case the circumstances are more serious. The offender is a Persian, who is proved to possess a very bad character, but who has apparently been allowed employment on board the British Indian Steam Navigation Company’s steamers on account of his influence over the class from which the coolies are drawn, this influence being due to his reputation for cruelty and general wickedness during a period of service as Eerrash-bashi and executioner under the Deputy Governor of Lingah. In an endeavour to involve in his own misfortune the permanent servant of the Steamer Company, whose office was immediately to supervise him, this individual has confessed to having committed not only the offence of which he is accused, but also of having habitually pilfered cargo. At the same time he has most successfully concealed the Bs. 300 now stolen. I am of opinion that this man’s punishment cannot be adequately fixed at less than two years’ rigo rous imprisonment. He is said to be practically impervious to the effect of floggings and hot-iron firings which punishments he was made acquainted with in his own person before he fled from Persia, so that if his present offence had been committed iu that country, there is not much doubt that he would now be condemned, by any but a friendly judge, to suffer the loss of his right hand. p. The Government of Bahrein have no arrangements for keeping convicts in durance for any but the shortest periods. In this particular case, too, the Sheikh would doubtless object, if he were asked to feed and imprison a foreigner who had committed a crime on board a vessel in his waters certainly, but claiming extra-territoriality against him. Were the offence sufficiently unimportant as to merit only a few months' imprisonment, the difficulty could perhaps be evaded by the constitution of a Court, composed of myself and a representative of the Chief, as is customarily done when an accused is a Bahrein subject or a foreigner who prefers not to invoke British good offices, and the other party is a British or foreign subject who does. J 7. Nor does it seem desirable that the trial of the accused should be informally completed by me and that he should then be made over to the Persian authorities to undergo such sentence as they may be capriciously pleased to enforce upon him. It is possible that in such circumstances he might suffer a no more worse punishment than imprisonment until the Maho- medan New Year s day, but, on the other hand, as a refugee from Persia, and more particularly if he is a fugitive from the jurisdiction of the present Governor of the Gulf Ports, his treatment might be worse than, the Government of India would care to contemplate. 8. It seems to me that such a case as this may occur again. Moreover, there are a number of foreigners, such as Native Christians, in the islands in regard to whom a sentence of a long term of imprisonment here or even the trial of a capital charge would be impossible. 9 - Under Poreign Department Notification No. 468-E.A.. dated the 22nd March 1901, communicated to my predecessor under your office endorsement No. 379, dated the 20th April 1901, the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein was granted the powers of a Magistrate of the 1st Class in respect of offences committed by Native Indian subjects of His Majesty. This seems to be the only enactment dealing with this subject affecting Bahrein, as the “ Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council, 1889,” so far as I understand, applies only to u that portion of the coasts and islands of the ,i :an . d ? ulf of 0mau w3lich is within the dominions of His Majesty the Shah of Persia. ’ No Sessions Court nor higher. Appellate Court have been yet indicated, nor have I any instructions as to whether in serious cases I am permitted to^ commit convicts to a jail in British India. I submit that the time is now ripe for a decision on all these points, and further I would beg to be granted the powers of a Justice of the Peace, as is almost invariably done, I believe, in India in the case of European 1st Class Magistrates. 6’'‘TP i f In 00 ° 0,l i s ipii ) I would be 'lad to receive instructions on the subject ustmg under-trial prisoners and short-term convicts, as also of anv other STth Tf ' naToidabl r b « incurred in relation to sulh persons dieting nf h e-tr st tWelTe months 1 submitted no bills on account of the cither prisoners or refugee-slaves, as I have always been able to . su ® h P e “P le °“ t 116 construction of Government buildings, and will still be able to do so for a little time longer. This method of meeting the difficulty will however eventually cease, and it would then appear necessary that I should be authorised to draw from some special allotment of my annual Budget Grant. .1 !&gt; f G.

As regards the general question, Lord Lansdowne is aware of the terms of our agree ment with the Sheikh, dated the 22nd of December 1880, and of our recent recognition of Sheikh Hamid as his father’s successor, which formed the subject of your letter dated 9th December 1898. The Sublime Porte has been repeatedly informed that the Chief of Bahrein is under the protection of the British Government, as in the note vei'bale delivered by Sir Philip Currie, No. 16, dated 8th Eebruary 1896, and it is presumed that, in the correspondence with the American Ambassador ending with your letter dated 18th December 1899 relative to the Missionary Mr. S. M. Zwemer, the same position was taken up. In these circumstances, it would seem that no diplomatic steps need he taken to place our position on a more definite footing as desired by the Viceroy, and that the proper course is that suggested' by Sir N. O’Conor in his Despatch, No. 168, dated the 5th of May 1901, namely, to give on our own part a material proof of our authority over the island, as, for instance, by inducing the Sheikh to appoint a British subject Director of the Bahrein Customs This suggestion has been forwarded to the Govern ment of India, and has been commended to them for favourable consideration. In this connection I am also to notice the fact that, although the Native News Agent at Bahrein has been replaced by a British official, no permanent arrangement has yet been made there by the Governor-General in Council, as will appear from this Office letter dated 27th Eebruary 1900, forwarding a report from the Political Besident, Persian Gulf, No. 19, dated 18th January 1900, to the Eoreign Secretary to the Government of India. Lord George Hamilton is inclined to think that when the Government of India are adequately represented at Bahrein, and if the Chief should be induced to appoint a British Director of Customs, a considerable advance will he made in securing the object which the Viceroy desires.
