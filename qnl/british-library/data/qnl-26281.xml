The Council would, however, he glad if an assurance can he given that nothing has transpired wxiich C M in any way interfere with existing rights to make use of the landing grounds at Jahrah, Suhaihiya and at Koweit town, I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, Copies of this letter are being sent to the Foreign Office and Admiralty,u.s.s. please see the letter from the Political Agent, Koweit, dated 29th April, with Colonel Fowled covering letter of 12th May on the subject of the acquisition of facilities for aircraft in Koweit. The question at issue is whether H.M.G. are prepared to spend a good deal of money in acquiring the old Bunder Shuwaikh site at Koweit for air purposes, or whether they are prepared to risk the Koweit Oil Company developing the site under their lease, in which case the site would not legally be available if it was required for Imperial air purposes and there might not be any alternative site available. This matter was discussed at great length in 1934. The Air Ministry apparently think that it is not likely to be possible for a number of years to decide whether the site is actually going to be required for Imperial air purposes or not (presumably it turns to some extent on how the position in Iraq develops) and they do not feel at liberty to spend large sums of money on the possibility that the site might come in useful later on. On the other hand there are the arguments adduced by Captain/g) @) 2 .

The Kuwait Oil Company, so their Manager privately informs me, are this Autumn likely to driP-s- for in the cents and central south of Kuwait territoi*y and they will u^e and Inevitably develop to a certain extent the harbour area known as cHGfWAIKH or the quarantine site, should they strike oil they will develop it fully, as they re entitled to do ; save for the following reservation which comes in Article a of the Agreement between the Kuwait Oil Company and His Britannic Majesty’s Governments- * f Kotwithstanding anything contained in the agreement ”b«t een the company and the shaikh the Company shall not ’♦have the right to use or occupy, and shell not include 'in the areas selected for the purposes of its operations, 'any sites which may have been selected by or on behalf of 'the shaikh or His Majesty’s Government for defence purposesj 'for aerodromes, aeroplane or seaplane bases or xor wire— 'less and telegraph installations or in connection with the j 'rt^v^ln-nment of harbours, provided that with the consent 'of His Majesty’s Government which shall not be unreasonably 'withheld the Company shall have the rii^it to use for the 'purposes of its operations such harbours as raay be develops 'by the shaikh or His Majesty’s government if there is not 'reasonable harbour accomodation available elsewhere. 'Harbours developed by the Company shall be under its 'complete and exclusive control . Once/LI - 2 • ^ * Qnoe however development has begun the iiir Ministry will have no rights againat the Ccanpany in respect of any area already developed (3ee India Office Letter 2408/34 of the 10th April 1934 f Mr.Gilbert Laithwaite to fing Commander kcClau^iry). 3. It will be remembered that the Air Ministry dropped the idea of a two years option at £.120 a year as being too it short an option but/is not too late to take up a raital at the figure already quoted (£.1200) should His Uritannic Majesty’s Govemmont wish to do so. 4. It seems conceivable that the admiraltyas well as the Air Ministry, and even perhaps the Committee of Imperial Defence may be interested to know that thif&gt; site which has three times figured in the history of Imperial Communication© (1775,1907 and 1914) is at last to be developed and will in a few months cease to be available fbr the use of His Britannic Ma je sty’s Government• 5. As the Air Officer Commanding in Iraq has pointed out - there is no suitable alternative sea plane mooring place on thif ’ coast. There is no other large landing ground with a town by it in this area except at Kuwait nor any other anchorage within a few yards of the shore and so good as in this area. 5. I have the honour to suggest therefore and before it is too late that the vc lue of this site in a territory under British protection should be once more considered, since it seems to form a potential base, alternative to Basra, which place in certain circumstances might not be available, end to be too valuable to abandon for the sake of the cum (£.1200 per annum) for which a lease can be obtained for the whole area; a portion if desired being sublet or re-leased for use of the Kuwait Oil Company.

Two years is too short a period to be of practical value and an option for 5 years, even if it were obtainable, is considered unlikely to meet the requirements of the Air Ministry. 2.

With regard to the Shaikh*s contention that while Bahrain was getting a £120 per annum from the Royal Air Porce in addition to what they received under the Civil Air Agreement, he - the Shaikh - was only receiving the rent provided for by the Civil Air Agreement, I took the following line: - 2. As Major Watts had already pointed out to the Shaikh, there were 2 H concessions M in Bahrain: 1. The Civil aerodrome in Mulharraq covered by the Civil Air Agreement; 2. The Royal Air Porce aerodrome and Royal Air Porce base in Manamah for which the £120 was paid. Likewise there were in Kuwait 2 'concessions” : 1. The Civil Aerodrome covered by the Civil Air Agreement; 2. The R.A.P. option on the Shuwaikh area for which £120 per annum rent would be paid. The Shaikh therefore was on all fours with the Shaikh of Bahrain, in fact better off since in the case of Kuwait £120 was being paid for actial use and possession. 3. The Shaikh seemed to see the force of these simple arguments and expressed himself satisfied with the arrangements. It now remains for the Political Agent, Kuwait, under the orders of Colonel Loch, by an exchange of letters with the Shaikh, to obtain the formal option of the Shuwaikh area for a period of 2 years at a rental of £120 perper annum and also to obtain the formal agreement of the Shaikh to rent this area for £1200 per annum at any time it may be required up to the expiry of the 2 years option. 4. It should be noted, of course, that under this agreement, if at the end of the 2 years option, His Majesty’s Government are not prepared to rent the area in question, and the Shaikh is not willing to extend the option, the latter will be lost.

Note of a conversation between Colonel Fowle and His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad, Ruler of Kuwait, on 18th of July, 1934 at which Major Watts, Political Agent, Kuwait, was present: on the subject of the Shaikhs attitude towards Jurisdiction over foreigners. //hile passing through Kuwait on leave on my way to catch the Westbound Airways* machine at Basra, I took the opportunity to do a 'holiday task',(I had already handed over to Colonel Loch) by having a conversation with Shaikh Ahmad on various subjects - the above amongst others. I found the Shaikh looking rather puffy and Dr.G-reenway informs me that he has given up the unequal struggle against corpulence: some years ago he was 16 Stone but by severe dieting reduced himself to 12. 2. The Shaikh was amiable as usual. I touched on the Mylrea Case. This case is now more or less closed, and was reported by Major Watts to Colonel Loch and myself verbally in Bushire. Major Watts is following this up with a written report. My object therefore was not te to exhume the case but (a) to impress on His lixrcellency that matters connected with British Subjects should be referred to the Political Agent before action is taken by him; (b) to ascertain indirectly, in connection with the new Order-in-Council, what the Shaikh's attitude would be towards handing over jurisdiction of non-Moslem foreigners to us. 3. With regard to (a). i pointed out that since Dr.Mylrea was a British subject, though employed by the American Mission, it would have been more correct for His Excellency/- 2 - r _ His ICxoellency to have brought his canplaint against Dr. Mylrea in the first instance to the Political Agent, instead of making it direct, without notifying Major Watts, to the headquarters of the Mission in America: the course His Excellency had actually adopted. The Shaikh frankly acknowledged that his action had been incorrect. With regard to (b). In order to test the Shaikh’s attitude I went on, purposely somewhat vaguely, to ask what he would do if at any time he had cause of complaint against individual foreigners, French, G-erman, American etc., within his territory. He replied that he had nothing to do with French, German etc. , Governments and would refer the case to the Political Agent. This satisfactory attitude indicates either (i) that he - the Shaikh - is under the impression that non-Moslem foreigners are under our jurisdiction not his or (ii) that even if he regards them as under his jurisdiction he is quite willing to transfer this responsibility on to us. 5. If (i) is the case then when we submit the new Order-in-Council to the Shaikh, presumably he will be made aware of the fact that non-Moslem foreigners are at present not under our jurisdiction. However, we are bringing in the new Order-in-Council not so much vis a’ vis the Shaikh as vis d vis foreign Governments, and presumably from (ii) we can deduce that his attitude should not be obstructive.

T*C.Fowle, Lieut.-Colonel.CONFIDENTIAL Note of conversation between Colonel Fowle and His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad, Ruler of Kuwait, on 18th of July 1934 at which Major Watts, Political Agent, Kuwait, was present, on the subject of Kuwait-Iraq smuggling;« With reference to Bushire telegram No,632, dated the 11th July 1934, I had a short talk with the Shaikh, and informed the latter that on my way through Baghdad I would discuss his infomal proposals for tightening up his sea manifests with Mr.Sievewright, Director of Iraq Customs. 2. He had no objection and his proposals are as follows: (1) That all concerned in Kuwait would be warned that no goods could be exported by sea without being manifested: persons found violating this order would be punished. (2) The Nakhuda of every boat sailing from Kuwait would be given a spare copy of the manifest of the gpods carried by him. On the ships return to Kuwait this manifest would have to be produced showing an endorsement by the Customs official of the port or ports of destination, certifying that the relevant goods had been duly landed at that port. 3. The Shaikh having shown by these proposals that he is willing to tighten up his manifests by sea, it will be for Mr.Sievewright, if he considers that these proposals are not sufficient, to indicate where they fall short of the requirements of the Iraq Government.

The R.A.F. option on the Shuwaikh area for which £.120 per annum rent would be paid* The Shaikh therefore was on all fours with the shaikh of Bahraih, in fact better off since in the case of Kuwait £.120 was being paid only for an option while in Bahrain it was being paid for actual use and possession. 3. The Shaikh seemed to see the force of these simple arguments and expressed himself satisfied with the arrangements. It new remains for the Political Agent, Kuwait, under the orders of Colonel Loch, by an exchange of letters with the Shaikh, to obtain the formal option of the Shumlkh area for a period of 2 years at a rental- 2 rental of £.120 per annum and also to obtain the formal agreement of the Shaikh to rent this area for £.1200 per annum at any time it may be required up to the expiry of the 2 years option. 4.

In these noteb the Sheikh of Koweit is stated to have agreed to allow us to have a lien upon the quarantine site (area la) at an annual rent of £100 for two year» only, after which time we are required to say definitely whether or not we wish to take up the site for development as an air base at an annual rental of i:1200. I fear that such an arrangement will be of very little use to us as it is highly unlikely that we shall oe able to make our decision within so short; a time. It is difficult to estimate what period is likely to elapse before we need make any decision on this point, out so far as if is possible to estimate now, five or six years would seem to be the minimum period which would oe any use to us. If we have to make an estimate I thinK ten years would be a more suitable period,thougn,naturally, it is very much preferable that we should not nave to specify any deiinire period* I understood from you on the telephone that you thought it possible the Sheikh could oe persuaded to oe more lothcoming and that you intend to take up the matter with Colonel Powle when he arrives home on leave. , £_,MT BY AIR MAR Yours sincerely. 30 26 •G.Laithwaite, Esq., India Office* , ly aj s. w. i, ■..*.« ^ P 0 LI ' ,CA A.

The Shaikh readily agreed, pointing out that 8hu»raildi was the obvious place for our flying Boats, and emphasizing once again that he was always out to help the fluting services of His Majesty's Government to the beet of his power. He, however, felt bound to make the following conditions; purely to safeguard, the ri$\ts of his owl people and local shipownersi- (1) Kuwait ailing Graft at all tl: eB to be allowed full use of the whole of Shuwaikh harbour, there being no question of the denying them access to the harbour, or any part of it.

The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, The Residency, Bushir e.Copy. D.o./S.10815/4 . Air Headquarters, British Forces in Iraq, Hinaidi. Secret . 22nd May 1934. Dear Dickson, We have been anxious for some time to get good moorings for our flying boats placed down at Kuwait. The open anchorage is not suitable for flying boats and the channel by the naval pier, which is the best mooring position, is too deep to allow of anchors being used. 2. As you know, in the agreement between His Majesty^ Government and the Oil Company it lays down that the Oil Company may have complete control over Kuwait waters, unless certain areas are definitely required for defence purposes and earmarked as such. The Air Ministry consider that if moorings are laid down in the area concerned it will be equivalent to our earmarking such an area for our own use, and they are anxious that this should be done as soon as possible. 3. I am sure you will agree that these moorings should be laid down as soon as possible before negotiations by the Oil Company proceed any further, and I should be very much obliged if you will be good enough to approach the Shaikh on this subject and obtain his formal permission for us to lay down the moorings. 4. I will then ask Group Captain Saul to select the actual sites and make arrangements for the moorings to be put down. Yours sincerely, sd. a.D.C unningham Colonel H.R.P.Dickson,CIS., Political Agent, Kuwait.P.Z.4435/34 SECRET. Extract from Kuwait Intelligence Summary No. 5 of 1934, for the period from 1st to 15th June 1934. ' - / 50. IMPERIAL AIRWAYS . On June 14th the Westbound Imperial Airways aeroplane n Helena n landed and stayed the night at Kuwait. Previous information had been to the effect that the 'Helena' would be flying over sometime in the morning and not alighting at Kuwait. The whole of that day a strong T, Shamal ,T wind reaching almost gale force at times had been blowing, accompanied by dense clouds of fine dust. Visibility was in consequence low. Just after 7 p.m. when the light was failing the 'Helens suddenly appeared over the Town and landed on the aerodro e. or so petrol in handpid had therefore decided to stay the night at Kuwait. The local aerodrome consists only of a landing ground and there are no hangars. Luckily the wind continued to blow steadily from the north all night and the machine was passengers by air at Kuwait. With great difficulty, accommodation, food, bedding etc., were obtained for the 8 passengers at a house belong ing to the A.P.O.C. which was put at their disposal by that Company^ representative. The 'Helena' departed early the following morning. The pilot stated that the strong head winds and lack ox visibility had so delayed him that he only had an hour*s able to get protection under the shelter of the Town walls There is no rest house or proper accommodation formm INDEXED, Air Ministry reference: S.31084/Pt.Il/D.O.I.

Will you please refer to Colonel Fowled despatch No. 539-S of 7th June, 1934, under cover of which he for warded correspondence relating to the Koweit Civil Air Agreement. 2, In paragraph 6 of that despatch the Resident suggests that our offer for an option on the quarantine site at Koweit should he raised from £100 to £120 p.a. As the Treasury authority allowing us to make the offer enables the Air Ministry to pay a sum of about £100 a year for the reservation of the site we will certainly not allow the negotiations to fall through over a small addition of £20 per annum if the Resident and Political Agent consider it necessary to offer the higher figure. That being so, you can inform the Resident that we will be prepared to pay £120 per annum for reservation of the quarantine site on the terms previously agreed between us in correspondence ending with my letter S#31084 of 24th April, 19.34. 3. As far as paragraphs 4-6 of Colonel Dickson’s letter and paragraphs 2-4 of Colonel Fowle’s letter are concerned, the latter explains very clearly the difference between the position at Bahrain and Koweit. 4. Koweit is obviously much more likely to require R.a.F. assistance than Bahrain and has, in fact, been given such assistance on more than one occasion, and, therefore, it was quite as much in the interest of the Sheikh of Koweit himself as of the R.A.F. that our landing ground was established in his territory. 5. Moreover, there is a further consideration which has not been mentioned by the Resident and that is, that the civil base at Bahrain is much more important than the civil landing ground at Koweit. Koweit will-provide less J.C. Laithwaite Esq,, India Office, Whitehall, s « w vk ■.■ah , COPY SENT BY Aha MAIL of t r • NO. 27. S r ‘ SECRET L i i*' 5JUU1954 I HCt\ V traffic than Bahrain and owing to its proximity to Basrah will probably be used much less than the latter place, -hat being so a smaller sum will be collected at Koweit in respect of landing fees than at Bahrain, but nevertheless the Sheikh of the former place is being paid the same amount in respect/^ of the civil air agreement as the Sheikhs of Bahrain and dwadui;. We certainly do not consider the Sheikh has any grievance and agree, as suggested by Colonel Fowle, that full use might be made by the Political .agent of these argu ments when an opportunity presents itself* 6. If, as suggested by Colonel Fowle, in paragraph 5 of his despatch, the Sheikh proposes charging duty on R.A.F. fuel, we agree that the case will have to be dealt with on its merits, but we regard it as important that the Air Minis try should have a further opportunity of considering the matter when the Sheikh has shown his hand. As far as fuel required for aircraft passing through Koweit on passage up and down the Culf is concerned, this duty would probably be quite negligible, but it might oe pointed out to the Sheikh &lt; that he would, - in any case, hardly be justified in charging duty on fuel in respect of flights of an operational charac ter which might be undertaken in his own interests. ■7. There is another aspect, however, in connection with this question of duty which I would like to bring to your notice f In the event of our eventually establishing a R.A.F. base at Koweit the sum involved in payment of duty on fuel might be quite considerable and it is possible the Sheikh might also wish to charge duty on other classes of R.A.K. stores, the bill for which would, no doubt, be considerable. That being so, it is obviously desirable to avoid establishing any precedent in the matter of payment of duty on R.A*K. fuel at this stage if at all possible. 8. I am sending copies of this letter to Rendel at the Foreign Office, Seal at the Admiralty and Starling at the Petroleum Department. ' Yours ^ Ld’-OLfi/fr ■+/P.Z. 4126/34.

Tho Hon’blo Lieut.Colonel T.C.Fowlo, C.B.K., Political Heeident in ttio Persian Gulf, Hie Majeety’e Secretary of State for India, The India Office, London. Sir, I hare the honour to enclose copy of letter Ko.C-199, dated the 29th Bay 1934, from the Politic*! Agent, Kuwait, with enclosures, from which it will he seen that the Shaikh has signed the Glrll Air Agreement. This refleets credit on Colonel Dickson 9 s persuasiTe powers as the Shaikh at first evinced a certain amount of suspicion towards the Agreement, chiefly I think on account of it* unavoidably voluminous nature. 2. with regard to paragraphs 4-6 of Colonel Dickson 9 e letter. The reason why Bahrain in tho first place (paragraph 6 of Colonel Dickson’s letter) cm* to be given £120/- P«r annum, *nd Kuwait nothing, ie I imagine quite simple. The Shaikh of Bahrain asked for £120/- per annum r&lt;nd the Shaikh of Kuwait asked for nothing. The reason, too, why the Shaikh of Kuwait « ve the use of hie landing ground rent-free, and the Shaikh of Bahrain asked for rent, ie I think not far to seek. Kuwait being part of the mainland in c«se of emergency is largely dependent on the Royal Air Faroe for protection, and Bahrain being an Island is not: os long as His Majesty’s Sloops are in the Persian Gulf no force can invade Bahrain from the mainland. In other words the coming of the Uoyml Air Force to Kuwait was more in the interests of the latter than of the former, while in Bahrain it was the Royal Air Force who chiefly benefited since Bahrain is an essential link in the strategical route to India, and no corresponding advantage of defence accrued to the State.3* llorftOTftr BnhrnXn Kuwmit in th« mntt«r of landing ground* are not on all four*. At the former there are two landing ground*! (a) On Manemah Inland, for u»e of which the Uoyal Air force pay the £120/* rent referred to by the ohaihh of Kuwait, and which i« now practically a military aerodrome. Further the £130/* not only cowera the uee of the aerodrome but also the aite for the Hoyal kir Force bsee, quartere for personnel, Heat Houee, etc. ehich ie situated on Manamah. (b) On Muharraq Island which is the eiril aerodrome, the uee of which by the Royal Air Force i* given free under the term* of the Civil Air Agreement. At Kuwait there is only one aerodrome, corresponding to th**t on Mtth?irraq, and no base. 4. X am not of opinion therefore that the Shalfeh has any claim to the 4X20/* in connection with the Civil Air Agreement, and I suggest that X be authorised to send him the attached letter. 1 have not mentioned in my draft the argument* contained in paragraph 2 above but the Political Agent, Kuwait, when presenting the letter might at his discretion elaborate these oja litre person*! . The Shaihh is not backward in stressing Ki* Majesty’s Gerernmmnt'* obligation* to him and it doe* no harm, X think, from time to time to point out to him the corresponding benefits which he receive*. 5. From the Intel paragraph of the Shaikh** letter it is quite possible that while relinquishing the reoue*t for the £120/- rental he may state thnt he wishes to charge duty on Royal Air Force fuel a* i* done by the Bahrain State. If he doe* so thi* point can be taken up on it* merit*. 6. In connection, however, with a poesible future Royal Air Force base at Kuwait, (vide correspondence ending(g!®| omns.mTU\h POLITIC kh ^SNCT.

Ae the Shaikh, I know, feels deeply that preferential treatment has in some way or other been wen by Shaikh Hamad for the Bahrain Government, at the expenee of himself, who (to use his own word*) before Bahrain wae ever visited by any R.A.F.aircraft, always did everything he possibly could to assist Military machines landing at or making use of the aerodrome at Kuwait, I should be grateful if the matter could, in seme way, be put before the Air Ministry in London for their consideration. 6.

Pending development there would he no interference on tne part of tne Air Ministry with the area. 2. The uir Ministry, with Treasury approval, now accept this proposal. They were originally anxious that we should endeavour either to fix a lower rent than £1200 a year for the development period, or to secure/—secure the necessary rights from the sheikn for a retainer rent of £100 a year on the understanding that the amount to he paia in the event of development would he fixea in the light of trie circumstances then existing. It was pointer out to them demi-officially that Colonel DicKson would already he faced with a somewhat delicate negotiation; that it was undesirable, the Sheikh having made what is, from his standpoint, a generous offer, to vary the figure of £1200 if this could he avoided; and that, apart from that, the value of this area was likely to increase rather than decrease and that hy accepting now the generous figure now offered we would safeguard ourselves against any risk of having to pay an economic rent of say two or three times as much at some remote period in the future. The question is urgent in view of trie possibility of an early conclusion of the Koweit oil negotiations, we might telegraph as in the draft? We need not go into tne question of moorings dealt with in para.4(a) of the air Ministry letter at tills stage.

To deal first with the point raised in your letter of the 13th instant, which seems to be a variant of the suggestion made in paragraphs 4 and 5 of my letter of the 12th instant. We agree with your proposal that the sum of £100 per annum should be paid to the Sheikh of Koweit for recognising the quarantine site as one reserved to His Majesty’s Grovernment for air facilities within the terms of the Grovernment agreement with the Koweit Oil Company until such time as we decide to develop the site. If or when it is necessary to develop the site, we should be prepared to pay a rent of £1,200 per annum. Whether any attempt should be made to get the land for less we feel we must leave to you, particularly in view of paragraph 8 of the Political Agent’s despatch Ho. C-120 of the 4th April, 1934, forwarded under cover of your letter P.Z.2588/34 of the 19th April, 1934. 3. In this connection I enclose copy of a telegram which we have received from the ^.ir Officer Commanding, Iraq, in reply to ours (also attached), which indicates that there is no suitable alternative to the quarantine site either as a base for land aircraft or for flying boats, and this, of course, makes it even more desirable than we previously thought that that site should be safeguarded.

Rental of huwalkh ropcrty iJ.ea . jal^ Sir, In continuati on of my telegram No. 118 of 3rd April 19 34, I have the honour to report somewhat fuller on the question of rental of the ohawaikh property, as it is diffi cult to express everything one would like to say by means of a cable message. 2. Owing to the recent visits of Colonel #ard f end Kr.3clmonds of the ’Iraq Forei:?i Office followed by the visits of the tiutasarrif of Basra am the .American Minister, Baghdad (the second and last or whom stayed in my house) I was obliged to postpone my discussions with the Bhaikh in the matter of the rent he was prepared to charge for area (a) bhuwailch , till the 30th of March and 1st April. 3. Matters were delayed still further by iiy having to make a rather important and extended tour (sot© 230 miles in all) on 25th &amp;arch, when I visited the camps of the large number of Mutair, Awazim, .ab and Adwan tribes vdio recently were forced to enter Kuwait territory from Kejd owing to complete lack of grazing in tbeir om country. 4. To revert to the question of rental: The Shaikh at my two interviews with him received me with more than usual courtesy and consideration, but showed distinct reluctancereluctance to quote me a figure for the rent he expected to get from ue in the event of the Koyal Air Force deciding to lease the 3huwaikh site. He pointed out that he looked upon himself end Kuwait as part of the British iuzapire, and when it came to the demanding of rent from the Koyal Air Force for an area they mi^t require for the por-sibl© defence of Kuwait, and the Kuwait Oil Company (should the latter get their concession), he felt faced with a real difficulty. It was of course up to him to assist, he said, in reducing the rent he would charg to as moderate a figure as he possibly could, seeing that the Royal Air Force were part of the armed forces of Hie Majesty’s Government etc. etc., but he felt that if he mentioned any figure at all he might fix on some- thing too high end so be accused of ingratitude, or of trying to squeeze money out of His Majesty’s Government. This was the last thing he wanted, and he would, he said, far prefer that Ris Majesty’s Government, advlsed by me . should make him an offer, which would be fair to himself and agreeable to them. Were he dealing with a commercial concern, he added, he would know how to get the best for himself, but the Royal Air Force was a different proposition. 5. On my pointing out the unfairness of placing the burden of a decision on His Majesty’s Government, the Shaikh turned to me and asked me to fix myself what I thought a suitable and fair rental, assuring me that he had such entire faith in my sense of what was fair, that anything decided on would be acceptable. I continued however to press him for some sort of gi figure, and eventually the .shaikh reluctantly agreed to £.1200/- per annum. 6. \he above figure as I said in my telegram, I do not consider at all excessive, in view of the large and valuable property involved and in view of the fact that tim Quarantine buildings would be thrown in also. One must always/i - 3 - always raiaamber that in 1907, thaigh X admit circnjtastances were tiian scnewhBt differant, leased the same area from shaikh Mubarak for Rs.60,000 per annum, 7. I of course mentioned to the shaikh tlxat the Royal Air Force if indeed they ever took over the site had already agreed to abide by his conditions viz (a) to allorc native craft to use the shuwaikh harbour: (b) not to interfere with persons using the Kuwait-Basra road which passes through the property: (o) not to expect him (the ohaikh) to aver undertake repairs to the Quarantine buildings. Thi s pie used the Shaikh, 8. ?hat stood out during the whole of our talks, was the fact tht.t the Shaikh appeared genuinely anxious to assist and make things as easy as possible for the l oyal Air : &lt;n orce 'for the simple reason that they were part and parcel of King decree’s fighting forces and so protectors of Kuwait' (his words). It is therefore not improbable that in the event of ttie figure £1200/- being ccnsldered excessive by the Mr Ministry, I might be able to get the Shaikh to agree to a sll^itly further reduction, I, naturally however, would net like to try end beat him down further as it would rather savour of my trying to take an unfair advantage of his expressed loyalty to His Majesty t s Government, I think also that the Shaikh*s feelings would be considerably hurt, were I to try and beat hi* dowi further.

LAfTHWAITE.Minute Paper rp&gt;z ^(^J . political Department Legal Auviser, The Air kin is try are proposing to acquire certain sites in Koweit for air purposes, with which the Koweit Oil Company, in the event of its securing a concession, will not, under the terms of Article 8 of the Government Agreement of which a copy is attached, he able to interfere. Some difficulty has, however, arisen over one of these sites, referred to in the Air kinistry letter attached as site (a). The ! Sheikh is willing to grant it to H.k.G# in return for a rent of £1,200 a year. The Air kinistry, however, think this is too much and will apparently he satisfied if they can he allowed to put down and maintain moorings in the sea opposite to the site in question for use in connection with a flying boat anchorage. Would you he so good as to advise whether in your opinion if the Sheikh were prepared to now give H.k.G. (a) the right to put down moorings opposite the site in question at some indefinite date in the future; (h) immediately to put down such moorings, the moorings would in either such event he covered by the terms of Clause 8 of the Government Agreement and immune from interference by the Koweit Oil Company? H Oj- rt-A “ /«•The primary subject matter of Clause 8 is sites - meaning apparently land sites - which have been selectee by His Majesty's Government for defence purposes or under heads specified in Clause 8. A flying boat anchorage with moorings in the sea off this quarantine site (which I take it is in a harbour) would presumably come under the 'development of harbours' just as much as e.g. building jetties or buoying a deep-water channel. The clause contemplates the development of harbours (a) by His Majesty's Government with a proviso in favour of the Company in certain events; (b) by the Company in which case their control is complete and exclusive. The Company could not therefore object to His Majesty's Government under the Sheikh's authority putting down moorings, either now or later (now for choice). This does not get rid of the proviso to (a) above but \\ seems preferable to allowing the situation in (b) to arise. If the sites contemplated by Clause 8 are not necessarily land sites, but might also include sea sites, it does not seem to lead to any useful conclusion in the present case to suggest that a demarcated area in the sea selected for seaplane moorings may itself be a site, because so long as it is in a harbour the proviso under Clause 8 would attach. On the question of the land site, it may be worth consideration whether, although acquisition of the particular site has, as regards the Sheikh, been refused for the present, it may still be open to His Majesty's Government, as between the Company and His Majesty's Government under the present agreement, to say to the Company that the site has been selected. The contention seems a fair one that selection does not necessarily involve/Minute Paper. Department, involve actual or immediate acquisition and taking over possession. Of course the Sheikh might not like this, if it came to his ears, and the suggestion has its perils inasmuch as in Clause 8 the expression is used for both parties and if we used it now the Company could certainly claim the same construction if it suited them.P.Z.2483/34. \\y aear McGlaughry, ^any thanks for your letter of the 12th hpril, 3.31084, about air facilities in Koweit. I note your viev/s. We are senaing copies of your letter to the Political Resident ana the Political Agent, Koweit by to-aay's air mail, with the connectea corresponaence. 2. I aoubt very much, on the otner hana, if there is any real prospect of advance on the lines suggested in paragraphs 4 and 5 of your letter. An alternative site, as suggested in paragraph 6, woula, of course, meet the case. But your previous corresponaence with the A#0.C. suggests that it will not be very easy to find one, 3. Woula you like to consider the following suggestion? (I cannot of course say to what extent it would have any prospect of going down with the sheikh). Your position is that it is important (ana may be very important) to secure site (a) or a corresponaing site in Koweit in view of possible ultimate development?in connection with Iraq or the2 like, and it is of course generally accepted that the strategic- importance of Koweit is potentially very great. On the other hand, the possibility of development wnich would necessitate the use of such a site is remote: it may well be that we should never nave to use it at all, and in any event it is unlikely that it will be necessary to use it for many years to come. In those circumstances you not unnaturally see objection to paying so substantial a sum as £1,200 a year (or even half thct amount) for a site of which you would be making no use. It might conceivably be possible for Dickson, if Fowie agreed, to take the line with the Sheikh that, as he was aware, we were merely anxious to secure area (a) as an insurance area in view 01 the terms of tne howeit Oil Company’s concession and the possibility of difficulty later if we do not take the necessary precautions now; that, on the other hand, there would be no question of our using this area, so far as we could at tne moment judge, for many years to come; tha.t in these circumstances, while much appreciating the generous offer which had been made by the sheikh, we were reluctant to incur expenditure on the scale suggested; but that His Excellency might- be prepared to consider recognising the site in question as one reserved by us for air facilities within the terms of the Government Agreement/3 J Agreement with tne Koweit Oil Company, on the understanding that we should in fact take no action for some time to come to develop it, that if and when we did find it necessary (after reference to him) actively to develop the site, we would pay him £l,200^(or a smaller figure if you thought fit); hut that in the meantime, inasmuch as we should he paying merely for something which was only a reservation and did not involve any interference with the ordinary use of the site hy its present occupants, the sheikh, etc., we thought a nominal rent of some sort, say £100 a year, would prohahly meet the case. What would you think of action on these lines? We cannot, of course, say whether, even if the Resident thinks it sound, there would he any difficulty with the sheikh. But it seems at any rate an avenue worth exploring, and, as I have mentioned above, it does appear, though that is, of course, a matter entirely for you to judge, to he prima facie of real Importance to acquire rights over this site valid against trie Koweit Oil Company. Yours sincerely, J.G. LAITHWAITB.lily dear Laithwaite, JmJ- 1. With reference to your letter P.Z.2408/34, of the 10th April, 1934, we are no less anxious than yourselves that future contingencies should he provided for as far as possible, but the insurance we are asked to pay in the case of site (a) is much too high for us, and we do not feel that any useful purpose would be 'Served by bargaining with the Sheikh regarding that site. Even if the rent were only half what the Sheikh now asks, we would, I think, still consider it to be too high in view of the uncertainty whether the site will, in fact, ever be required as an air base. 2. In coming to our decision not to proceed with the acquisition of that site, we had in mind that, if an air base should eventually be required in Koweit, one could perhaps be found on the coast some distance south of Koweit Town, or even north of Koweit Bay. While an inland site need not be ruled out altogether, it is obviously desirable for communication, supply and defence purposes that any air base should be on or near the sea coast. 3. Articles 5 and 9 of the agreement between the Sheikh and the company deal with the acquisition of land in connection with oil development works and give the company discretion to purchase or lease whatever land they may consider necessary, subject to consultation with the Sheikh. That being so, it is not easy to suggest a compromise proposition which would meet our possible future requirements in respect of land which is not leased or purchased now. 4. It is possible, however, that in the event of the company raising the question of acquiring site (a), the Sheikh could be persuaded to make an attempt to exclude it, more especially if an alternative area, which would suit J.Gr.Laithwaite, Esq., India Office, S.W.l. COPY SENT DY Alfi MAILW 1 ■ ■ ' jwm » mm - - the company equally well, were available. No doubt the Sheikh, with the advice of the Political Agent, could find some very good ostensible reason for attempting to exclude site (a). 5. We can hardly expect the Sheikh to adopt a course which would result in financial loss to himself, and if the company make him a good offer and decline to accept an alternative, then I fear we must resign ourselves to the loss of site (a). On the other hand, as an inducement to the Sheikh to reserve that area against our possible future requirement he could be told (i) that we have no intention of developing it at present, and he could therefore continue to use it himself; (ii) if we do eventually desire to use the area we would be prepared to pay a reasonable price to do so. 6. Another alternative would be for us to select and reserve some other area if one can be found which would be suitable for the construction of an air base. I attach draft of a telegram which we would be prepared to send to the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, asking him to carry out a further reconnaissance, if you agree. Action on these lines can be taken while you are continuing discussions with the Sheikh on the lines of paragraphs 4 and 5 above, and in the event of your further negotiations being unsuccessful we might then be in a position to put forward proposals for the safeguarding of some alternative area. 7.

Yours sincerely. G. LAITHWAITE.AIR MINISTRY ADASTRAL HOUSE. April, 1934. * Tfill you please refer to my letter of the 20th March 1934, on the subject of acquisition of certain additional facilities for aircraft in Koweit and to Political Agent KoweiVs telegram of the 3rd instant in which he states that the Sheikh proposes to charge an annual rent of £1,200 for the quarantine site, previously referred to as site (a). 2. While we agree that the Sheikh’s terms are probably not unreasonable and appreciate the fact that^he wishes to help as far as he reasonably can, we regret that we do not feel justified in paying an annual rent of £1,200 perhaps for the next 20 years or more when there is no certainty that the site will eventually be required as a base to accommodate R.A.P. units. Also if that site should eventually be acquired by the oil company and we then find that a base is required in Koweit territory, it is possible that an alternative site could be obtained elsewhere, not necessarily so close to Koweit town. 3. It is perhaps a little unfortunate that after a certain amount of pressure had been brought to bear on the Shieikh to fix a rent which he would be prepared to accept, we should now decline his offer, but I fear this cannot be helped. Will you, therefore, please ask the Polit ical Agent to decline the Sheikh’s offer as far as the quarantine site is concerned and, if you think it desirable, explain the reasons for our decision. 4. At the same time we shall be grateful if you will accept the Sheikh's offer to let us have the sites at Jahra and Subaihiya free of charge. We leave it to you to decide what form of agreement or exchange of letters is necessary to put the matter on a formal basis, but would, of course. J.G.Laithwaite, Esq., India Office, S.W.l. OOPY SENT BY AIR MAIL1 like the concession to extend for the longest possible period of time. 5 # The only outstanding matter then is the need for a flying boat anchorage opposite the quarantine site and we shall be obliged if you can arrange with the Sheikh for us to be allowed to put down and maintain moorings there. We must, of course, accept the Sheikh's stipulation contained in Political Agent Koweit's telegram of the 27th February, 1934, that the anchorage shall not be denied to local craft. 6. It is possible, of course, as we are not now taking up the quarantine site, that the oil company may do so and that they may develop a harbour there. In that event we may come up against the difficulty mentioned in your letter P.2. 1825/34 of the 19th March, 1934, that Clause 8 of the Government Agreement provides that 'harbours developed by the company shall be under its complete and exclusive control'• 7. As we have been informed by the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, that there is no suitable alternative anchorage for flying boats, this is a serious difficulty. Y/e would suggest, however, that if a claim is now staked which allows us to put down moorings opposite the quarantine site, we might be covered by the first part of Clause 8 of the Government Agreement. We would be glad to have your views on this point and would also welcome any other suggestions as to how our requirement for a flying boat anchorage can now be safeguarded, and in any case would like you to obtain tfhe necessary authority to put down moorings near the quarantine site. Presumably the Sheikh would not make any charge for this concession. ' « .... 8.

(iii) Conditions laid down with the approval of the Shaikh to govern the use of aerodrome ( C) with schedule connected with landing fees and housing fees.

The only thing that the Shaikh now asks is that the renewal of the Agreement should be left to the choice■■■ of both parties at the end of the four years specified; or as he verbally explained, that para. 17 (Agreement B) should be altered to read something as follows:- 'This Agreement shall be renewable at the option 'of either His lajeety 1 s Government or the Shaikh* 'at the conclusion of 4 years etc. etc.' 4. His Kxeellency the Shaikh came to the above decision after I had had two long and very friendly heart to heart talks with him at Dasman Palace.

We have now ascertained from A.O.C. Iraq, that site (a) is required not only in conjunction with the flying boat anchorage but also as a site upon which to accommodate one or more landplane units should conditions in the future make it desirable to locate such units in Koweit. The existing landing ground just outside Koweit Town is not considered suitable as a base for aircraft both for health and defence reasons. We would therefore be grateful if you could ascertain upon what terms the Sheikh would be prepared to let us have site (a). 3. As regards paragraph 4 of your above quoted letter and with reference to your subsequent letter PZ.1825/24, dated 19th March, 1934, and to the agreement attached therewith, we agree that clause 8 of the agreement will probably cover the point you mention sufficiently. 4. The final sentence of clause 8 of the agreement, however, might be very inconvenient if the Company decide that site (a) and the anchorage opposite it are the only ones suitable for their purpose. The A.O.C. has already informed us that there is no alternative flying boat anchorage. If we J.G. Laithwaite, Esq., India Office, — m ^mm -ROM secretary, political ahd ' SECRET bept. INDIA W.l.

We note the views expressed by the Air Officer Commanding. 2. , Permission for the free use of the existing land ing ground will presumably be covered by the arrangements which the Political resident has been instructed to endeavour to make with the sheikh of Koweit in regard to civil and military aerodromes in his territory. 3. As regards additional facilities to meet possible future requirements, the attitude of the Koweit Oil Company is, I think, an important factor. In their conversations with us they have emphasised their desire that we shoulu, so far as possible, have selected any areas we may wish lor defence etc. purposes in advance, and while the suggestion made the Qatar facilities, that the by you phrase in connection with 11 any sites wnich Commander W.A.

Unless, therefore, the Air Ministry see strong objection, we think it would be desirable to take immediate steps to select the actual sites which will, in the Air Officer Commanding’s opinion, be required near Jhaira a,nd Subaihiya. Once the sites have been selected the desirability of acquiring them ana also the site described in (a) of the Air Officer Commanding’s telegram of doth January, as an insurance against the future, could be considered. Pending a decision on this point it will probably be desirable not to let it become generally known locally that we may be requiring certain sites in the near future, since if the areas referred to by the Air Officer Commanding are not Government land the effect may be to put up the price against us. 4* The position in regard to the points dealt with in paragraph 2 of your letter under reply is generally similar to that in regard to Qatar.

This includes the selection of suitable sites for an additional aerodrome, should the British Government decide it is required, and the erection of moorings for flying boats. Most of the papers are concerned with Bandar Shuwaikh [Bandar ash Shuwaykh], also referred to as ‘area A' or the ‘quarantine area’. The papers cover the process of enquiring as to what terms the Shaikh of Kuwait will consent to sell or rent the area to the British Government, and subsequent discussion as to whether the Air Ministry is willing to rent the area in question. The later correspondence covers proposed developments by the Kuwait Oil Company in 1939.Some correspondence is also included in relation to the Kuwait Civil Air Agreement (1934): a copy of this agreement can be found on folios 73-86, including a letter from Shaikh Sir Ahmad al Jabir as-Sabah [Shaikh, Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ] granting the RAF priority use of facilities.The main correspondents are as follows: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Trenchard Craven William Fowle and Percy Gordon Loch, acting), the Political Agent at Kuwait (Harold Richard Dickson, Gerald Simpson de Gaury, and Arnold Crawshaw Galloway), officials of the India Office (John Gilbert Laithwaite and Miles John Clauson), and the Air Ministry (Wilfred Ashton McClaughry). There is no correspondence in the file for 1935 and 1938.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Bandar Shuwaikh</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Land</topic></subject><subject><topic>Rent</topic></subject><subject><topic>Air defence</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>District Magistrate, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Kuwait Oil Company</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Kuwait</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000205#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
