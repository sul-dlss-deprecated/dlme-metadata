D.O.No.473. fp British Agency, Sharjah, The 9th May, 1949. V During his recent visit^ Mr .Burrows asked me whether I considered that the Agency guard 'should be strengthened in view of the increased amount of touring off the beaten track which the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, is likely to be required to do in future, I replied that I was not clear in my own mind as to whether this would be desirable or not, as I had never given the matter much thought. I did point out, however^ that extra guards on tour would involve extra transport and that our transport was barely adequate at present for existing needs. 2, As you know, at the moment, we have four Baluchi guards who, in effect, are little more than armed farrashes. No body of men, short of a young army, could ever justify our breaking with the existing arrangement whereby the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, travels under the protection of the various rulers, and as far as I can see, a small increase in our guard would only be an expensive half-measure, although such a gesture might have some prestige value. 3, On the other hand, as you know, so far this year, the Political Resident has paid no less than three visits to Sharjah by air, and on each occasion, I am glad to say, spent the night at this Agency. I have never been quite satisfied however that our existing guard is adequate either for his dignity or his security and on these grounds, the employment of some three or four extra men might perhaps be justified. 4, No doubt you may wish to give your views to Mr.Burrows when he returns to Bahrain. .
