Enclosure I. —General Iraq has suffered in 1947, in common with the rest of the world, from an increasing disillusion with the hopes of the brave new world which she shared with so many during the latter war and immediate post-war years. Nevertheless, she has had no wave of strikes, no breaches of internal security and no serious disagreements with other nations, except on the question of Palestine. The hope expressed, however, in last year’s review that her political life might proceed in 1947 on sound and pro ductive lines has not been fully realised. II. —Domestic Affairs 2. During the first two months of the year the political energies of Iraqis were fully occupied with the elections, the first to take place under the slightly liberalised provisions of the Electoral Law of 1946. Everywhere the elections passed off quietly and the results were probably a fair reflection of the national will as a whole, though the more articulate and pro gressive elements were very disgruntled at their lack of success and were immoderate in their allegations of administrative inter ference. Such interference is inevitable in a country where political consciousness is so rudimentary as in Iraq and is the natural consequence of the imposition of a democratic constitution on a society which has only partially and recently emerged from tribalism. 3. The Government which emerged from these elections was not a strong combina tion although it was headed by perhaps the best of the younger front-rank politicians, Salih Jabr, and enjoyed the whole-hearted support of the Regent and of Nuri Pasha, who still retains his dominating position on the Iraqi political stage. The pro gramme of the new Cabinet was ambitious and extensive, it consisted for the most part of an outline financial and economic plan for Iraq, the realisation of which would, in the nature of things, and especially of things Iraqi, take several years to complete. Other important items in the Government’s programme were revision of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty and the improvement of Government machinery. This latter item is of cardinal importance, for on its successful achieve ment depends largely the success or failure of the economic development plans. 4. The parliamentary session ended on 19th July. In this session a mass of legis lation was passed, and it is to the credit of the Government that so much was achieved The main measures passed were economic or financial in character, and included the budget, the first since 1945. But even so a great deal of the Govern ment’s programme remained without being passed into law, let alone active imple mentation, and the most important reform, that of the machinery of Government administration had not been started. 5. The annual summer lull in Iraqi political life was intensified in 1947 by the absence of the Regent in England, of Nuri Pasha and the Minister for Foreign Affairs at Lake Success and of the Prime Minister at the various meetings of the Arab League on the subject of Palestine. 111-77During this period the position of the Government was becoming more difficult as a result of the lack of competence of those Ministers left in Iraq, and of the mounting economic difficulties occasioned by the world shortage of dollars and by the exceptionally bad harvest of 1947 in Iraq. The Iraqi Government partly in response to pressure from the powerful landed interests and partly in their natural desire to obtain foreign exchange had permitted the free export of barley, although they were well aware that the failure of the wheat harvest might well cause difficulties in feeding the populations of the large towns during the early months of 1948 before the next crop came on the market. The free export of barley has now been stopped. A standard mixed wheat and barley loaf has been introduced and strenuous efforts are being made by the Government to obtain imports of wheat. It is to be hoped that these efforts will be successful in obtaining sufficient wheat to avoid serious shortages in the months immediately before the harvest. 6. Perhaps the most notable of the developments in the climate of Iraqi politics has been the re-emergence of the type of thought which from its beginnings in the Bekr Sidqi movement in 1936 reached its culmination and consequent discredit in that of Rashid Ali al Gailani in 1941. The basis of this movement was two-fold, nationalist resentment at what were regarded as the fetters of the British connexion and a largely genuine dis approval of the corruption and inefficiency of governmental machinery in Iraq. These two motives are still operative and the disillusion caused by the disastrous failure of the Rashid Ali movement is beginning to wear off, while the pro gressive release or return from exile of his prominent supporters has added strength to the Right wing and the repressive measures taken by the Government against the Left have worked in the same direction. The events in Indonesia, the submission of the Anglo-Egyptian dispute to the Security Council and above all the vote at Lake Success on Palestine have helped to induce in young Iraqis a tendency to despair of fruitful co-operation with Western | democracy and to turn towards Pan- ! Islamic reaction against the West. It is noteworthy that the Independence Party, that of the extreme Right, although pro fessing its dislike of Communist ideology, is of all Iraqi parties except the illegal Communist Party the readiest for co operation with the U.S.S.R. III.—External Affairs 7. The revision of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance of 1930 was accorded pride of place in the Government’s pro gramme, and received further mention in the speech from the throne at the opening of the December session of the Iraqi liament. Although this treaty has workea ^ on the whole extremely well and to the satisfaction of both parties to it, there is a widespread feeling in Iraq that, although the treaty has still some years to run, the interests of Anglo-Iraqi friendship would be served by its modification now. Certain of its provisions are held to be unneces sarily rigid and to place Iraq too obviously in the position of a junior partner. Many of those who argue in this way are undoubtedly genuine in their desire for continued Anglo-Iraqi association, though, of course, there are others whose motives are less praiseworthy. Iraqi desire for the revision of the treaty has undoubtedly been increased by her impatience to be rid of the imputation frequently cast at her by her fellow-members of the Arab League of not being free from British interference in her national life. During the visit of His Royal Highness the Regent to London during the summer, there were some pre liminary exchanges of views and at the meeting of the Iraqi Parliament to discuss the reply to the speech from the throne on 31st December the Prime Minister announced his projected departure to the United Kingdom to undertake negotiations. 8. Iraq’s relations with Turkey and Transjordan have been strengthened by the ratification during 1947 of treaties with these two countries. Neither of these treaties was received very graciously by the Iraqi Parliament and the debates reflected the lack of self-confidence of Iraq in herself, since both treaties were attacked on the grounds that they gave to Trans jordan and Turkey the opportunity to interfere in the one case in the political and in the other in the economic affairs of Iraq. Nevertheless, both were passed by handsome majorities. 9. The increasing influence of the Arab League in Iraq has been illustrated in many ways. Iraq's recognition of the Indonesian Republic, her official interest in the future of the ex-Italian possessions of Libya and Cyrenaica and her semi official reception of a prominent North African political exile are cases in point. This influence, with its increasingly pan- Islamic tendency, has not always been welcome to the Iraqi Government, but the latter has never felt sufficiently sure of itssupport inside Iraq to resist it, especially in view of the overriding necessity for the appearance of Arab unity in resistance to the partition of Palestine. 10. Iraqi political opinion shares to the full the Arab feelings of frustration and ~““ , ear despair about the partition decision which seems to them a cynical disregard of natural justice out of deference to political and financial pressure. The pro ceedings in the General Assembly were anxiously followed and Iraq was not behind other Arab States in prophesies of violent Arab reaction against partition, by which they hoped to influence the Assembly’s decision. The Assembly was not deterred, however, and the Iraq Government is now to some extent the victim of their own brave words which the opposi tion is not slow to challenge them to make good. How effective the Arab resistance to partition will be and what Iraq’s share in it will amount to will appear in 1948. In 1947 the Palestine question has been a major preoccupation of the Iraqi Govern ment, it has caused the absence from Iraq of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and EXT of Nuri Pasha for much of the y^ar. The Prime Minister himself has 3tiend ed Arab League meetings on the siil ij-ec.t ; much to the prejudice of the functioning of administration in Iraq and consequent weakening of the position of his Govern ment. On public opinion in Iraq the effect has been to strengthen the hands of those who wish to turn their backs on Western civilisation, merely borrowing its technique in order the more effectively to resist it. 11. These latter are still few in numbers and small in influence and there is at present no reason to take a pessimistic view of the political future of Iraq. Her political future will depend to a great extent on the orderly development of her great natural economic resources and on a steady rise in the standard of life and education of her people. The Iraqi govern ing classes have recognised this and in their economic development schemes the present Government have begun to give effect to this recognition. They also recognise the value of Iraq’s association with Great Britain and will not lightly cast it aside.CGt'Y # jt . »- &gt; '• Ifhle 1200 ✓ /©. / ^‘* %)(?n # /c/oo*\ ^ .y* (S 9 88/19/9 3 &gt; No. 31 (I 66 /I 4 / 46 ) Sir, . s ^ ! r ^ ^ V j b i n?.'. r •• i :% r, .

There are her*/ever throe points that are appi'eeiated by the vast anority of the population and they are (i) that one of the issues of the Aserbaijan ©tru -gle ie Kuxdleh independence, (ii) tluit one of the treat r ©were of the world is active sympathiser in this stn ggls and (ill) that tulla uetafa and his follower©, whan the Iraqi Government with the help of Kurdioh tribee ux*ove out of Iraq, are important participant© in thi© struggle far freedaa* Kecognicinr: ns they do no ro/il frontiers hot veen the various part© of Kurdistan, they ©00 it as a logical and inevitable conclusion that once the situation across the frontier is etablised, Eulla Mustafa with the Kurds of Aserbaijan will turn toward© Iraq. oreover people coming across tlxe frontier bring report© that UxQJm tistrfa has ex reseed this ar. hi© intention, not only to free the Iraqi Kurds, but to punish thoiiS who last year were traitors to the Kurdish cause* (d'&gt; It may be objected that the Iraqi Government was considerably as elated last year by Kurdish tribe© and that the Stu e would probably happen again* In my opinion however there ar© several leasons, which make such an^event improbable * (i) There is no doubt in my opinion that the majority of tlxe tribal leaders, who helped th© ,Govex*nraont, were aiaong the worst type of KuiAq, almost universally dis liked and motivated in what they did by private emnity, jealousy and the desire for gain* instance only a few, Sheikh Bashid of bolan, Kheikh Haqib Surchi and the Sibari Aghas. hone of these people are popular ana the Sibnri Aghas have always been hated as cruel and oppressive* Hor has this bad reputation been impiovod by/by their actions of laet year. They know this and save in the case of Sheikh Rashid of Lolan I think it improbable that they would repeat their performance. (ii) Laet year, Kurdish independence seemed a very faint hope and the Iraqi Government’s struggle against Mulla Mustafa seemed no more than a government attempt to punish a difficult and obstinate family, who had traditionally always been at loggerheads with the government. Now however circumstances have changed cookietely and so has Mulla Mustafa’s position and standing. (iii) Nor should the ver/ effective propaganda of the local officials and of the Iraq Army last year be discounted. Britain, the one great power whose influence has always been great in North Iraq since the formation of the Iraq state and whom the Kurds of Iraq have always regarded as their friends and protectors, was published abroad among the tribes as the really great force behind the Iraqi Government’s struggle against Mulla Mustafa. The army pointed to their equipment, to their armt, to their aeroplanes, their artillery, their lorries and to the British military mission as all supplied by the British to help in the destruction of Mulla Mustafa. But now another equally great power has appeared on the arena and is showing itself, if not officially, at any rate privately sympathetic to Kurdish aspirations and at least to the extent of encouraging them. (e) Though the younger generation cannot remember, the older people of Rowanduz can recall with bitterness in their hearts the Russian invasion of the Rowanduz area, which they burned and pillaged until they left only the bare hillsides. Yet there are indications that this traditional hatred is bein^; tempered not only by all the many reports of Russian fair dealing and good relations with the Kurds of Persia, but also by a feeling of resignation that the present situation cannot be endured any longer and that the assistance of the Russians is better than no assistance at all. The terms Communist and Bolshevist are still words that frighten the tribal people and the older people will hesitate to consort with the Russians unless desperation arives them into their arms. (f) It is wrong to imagine that there is any widespread anti-British feeling. The Kurds realise that without the presence of the British in Iraq, their lot would have been much harder and that the British have done many good works in Kurdistan. There is still a hope that the British may even yet prove sympathetic, but that hope fades as the days pass. Among educated Kuras, it is not uncommon to hear Britain bitterly criticised on the grounds that, having spoken so long about the Atlantic Charter and the rights of small nations, she now appears to have forgotten its existence. But the tribal people remember only that in the early days, when Rowanduz was an area of desolation and starvation, British officers came and brought it back to life. (g) The calling up of the 1927 class for military service on 1st January, 1946 has added to the general depreasion, since the area has little reason to love the army after the unfortunate events of last year. The smell left behind will not be dissipated easily. Even the local administration has bitter memories of those days. The calling-up is being conducted with greater /severityseverity than usually 9 but tbe aucober of w bebelcbies H (those who pay IB .50 and do only three oionths) is reported to he high* 2* AZKiihAlviiI&lt; (1) A chanoe meeting on the Iraqi—Persian frontier at Zino Bheikh with three Kurdish notables from Persian Kurdistan f Mohammed Amin Agha of Shinawa f chief of Piran in Iran f uarani Agha of Kalat *iash of Piran and Lbeikh Muslih, a relation of &amp;heiKh Obeidullab of Zino f produced some colourful though interesting information about events in Azerbaijan* Notwithstanding the momentous events now taking place in Persia, events which they were at great pains to*describe and their share in which tb^y were at great pains to demonstrate, they had left the great arena to come to Iraq to ask for the hand of the daughter of L&gt;war Agh a Piran of nania# Unli ve tue situation of a fow months ago, when it was difficult to get the Kurds of Persia to speak freely about the political situation in that side of the frontier, there was no apparent hesitation on the part of these three.

Enclosure. p-is... d) -&amp;yyuisr\ cjjnJl Political Review, 1944. Introductory. THE year 1944 has been a quiet one for Iraq. The recession of the enemy threat to the Middle East and the recent Allied victories have led Iraqis to believe that the war is as good as over. Apart from supplying primary products required by the Allies, Iraq, like all other countries of the Middle East, is playing no active part in the fight. Indeed, it is only the presence of British and Indian troops that provides visible evidence that she is a belligerent. On the othei hand, the economic consequences of war have made themselves painfully felt. Ine country as a political unit has enjoyed continued prosperity, thanks to the main tenance, though on a reduced scale, of British war expenditure and to an adequate harvest. But the general population’s condition of life has been further depressed by restricted imports and rising prices. The measures taken to combat these tendencies proved in the mam ineffective, and the dismissal of Colonel Bayliss, the Director-General of Imports, was followed by a period of economic decontrol. 2. In the sphere of internal politics, Nuri Pasha’s Cabinet was replaced in June by an administration of similar type under Hamdi Pachachi. Apart from the endemic restlessness in the Barzan area of Kurdistan, internal order was well maintained. Relations between imperial troops and the Iraqi population veie unruffled. In the sphere of foreign affairs, the problems of Palestine and the Levant States were closely followed with increasing indignation against the Zionists and the French. 3. The excellent Anglo-Iraqi relations which subsisted throughout the year have again proved the value of His Majesty’s Government’s policy towards this country. While indications are not lacking of difficulties ahead, it is appreciated by the majority of thinking Iraqis that their country is too weak to stand alone in the world of our times, that Iraq therefore needs the help and protection of a friendly Great Power, and it is hoped that that Power will continue to be Great Britain. Internal Politics. 4. For the first six months of the year Iraqi politics were concerned mainly with the question whether or not Nuri Pasha was to continue to direct the administration of the country. He had been Prime Minister continuously from October 1941, but he had been obliged to reorganise his Cabinet no less than nine times. Having used and discarded twenty-four different colleagues, he seemed to be coming to the end of possible combinations. His last team, formed in December 1943, was in many respects a good one, but it was strangely unpopular and never r 62 - 12 i I az 4-Se&lt;,^o*a. 3A Ola •*?/ 2 i MAR I 94 »no:a ( : nc2 enjoyed the Regent’s confidence. His Royal Highness particularly dish 'e e inclusion of Taufiq Suwaidi, Umar Nadhmi and Ali Mumtaz. whom he regarce as disloyal to himself. In Parliament the personal opponents of the 1 Hims er and of his colleagues soon realised how the land lay, and, encouraged by la sin Ali, the chamberlain at the Palace, set out to make trouble. 1 he Gove rumen s request for an adjournment was refused and the Opposition Deputies, abetted by a sympathetic President, were able to sustain their attacks with such persistence that in the end they wore down the strength of the Ministers and forced them to resign. The first manoeuvre of the Opposition was to call in question the legality of the appointment of Taufiq Suwaidi to be Deputy Prime Minister, a post specially instituted for him by Nuri Pasha. Having brought about Taufiq Suwaidi’s resignation by compelling the Government to refer to the High Court for a ruling, they were encouraged to seek to open up a more general engagement on every occasion. The Ministers became disheartened and maintained that it was unfair of the Regent to put them into office and then to encourage their enemies by allowing it to be known that they did not enjoy his favour. His Majesty s Ambassador repeatedly warned His Royal Highness that the uncertain situation in which he placed the Cabinet was harmful to the Administration and advised him that he should make up his mind either to give them a reasonable trial or to replace them by others if he were sure that better men could be found. Through out the spring months His Royal Highness vacillated between these two courses, while the Cabinet’s critics, both in the Senate and the Chamber, continued to gain confidence and to increase the weight of their attacks. The climax was reached during the last days of the debate on the budget. The Opposition Deputies passed from criticism to abuse and an uproar ensued, which obliged the President to suspend the meeting. Nuri Pasha tendered his resignation, explaining that it was impossible for him to continue in office without the full and avowed support of the Regent. His Royal Highness thereupon called Hamdi Pachachi, a rich landowner of indifferent health, to form a Government. The invitation was accepted, but as the new Prime Minister was too unwell to collect colleagues, the Palace had to do it for him. The Cabinet which took office a fortnight later was everywhere known to be the Regent’s handiwork. The principal posts were filled by Mustafa al Umari (Minister of the Interior), Arshad al Umari (Minister for Foreign Affairs and Acting Minister of Supply), Salih Jabr (Minister of Finance), Tahsin Ali (Minister of Defence). Hamdi Pachachi offered portfolios to Nuri Pasha and Ibrahim Kemal, but both refused. Nuri was genuinely in need of rest and recuperation, and Ibrahim Kemal wanted nothing less than the premiership. 5. In a statement made in the Chamber shortly after the formation of his Government, Hamdi Pachachi regretted that, owing to his indisposition, no full programme for his Administration had been prepared. The Cabinet would, how ever, give their principal attention to three practical tasks, namely (a) to improve the organisation and work of the Supplies Department; (b) to take all measures to establish “ normal security and order ” throughout the country; (c) to improve efficiency and probity of Government officials. This statement made no reference to the Kurdish problem, but in a subsequent statement Hamdi Pachachi said that it was the intention of his Government to carry on the Kurdish policy of their predecessors and to implement an extensive programme of development in the north. 6. The extreme heat of midsummer, inducing as it invariably does frayed nerves and quickened tempers, usually produces a Cabinet crisis and in 1944 this supervened in August, when the Minister of Defence violently disagreed with his colleagues over General Renton's scheme of army reform. After a reshuffle of short duration, Hamdi Pachachi resigned and reformed his Cabinet. Apart from the dropping of Tashin Ali and a change-over in certain portfolios, the composition of the new Cabinet did not differ from that of the old. The Ministry of Supply, which for some months was held by more than one Minister in an acting capacity, was eventually filled by the promotion of its Director-General, no better- known politician being prepared to accept this invidious post or to associate him self with a Cabinet whose future by the close of the year had become very uncertain. Further changes took place in December at the Ministries of Social Affairs and Defence, the latter being awarded to the previous Chief of the General Staff. The parliamentary scene remains quiet, with the odds shortening at the time of writing on Nuri Pasha as the next Prime Minister. 7. Outside Parliament and the family circle of the Iraqi oligarchy there was a notable resurgence of political activity and discussion. This tendency was exemplified in the press. At the beginning of the year five Arabic daily'news papers were published in Bagdad. There are now eleven. Part of the press is, ofcourse, engaged in supporting the Government. The Opposition, whether in the press or out of it, is, thanks to a graduai lifting of the censorship, throwing off the restraint of the last three years. In many cases the old xenophobia and irrespon sible nationalism are apparent just below the surface, especially in attacks upon the “ imperialism ” of other Powers. But the general tone of the Opposition has not been by any means unconstructive. In the sphere of internal politics it has demanded an effective tackling of the supply problem, the purging of public life, decentralisation and the formation of political parties. As for the first two demands, no one could pretend that they were not justifiable. An important step towards decentralisation will have been made if the Government succeeds in its declared intention of placing on the statute book a revised Liwa administration law. The formation of political parties is unlikely to make rapid progress in a country where personalities count for more than principles, and where the mass of the population are politically uneducated. “ Communism ’ has undoubtedly increased during the year under review and “ Communist leaflets have been distributed on a wide scale. But these terms in Iraq imply no more than an academic and impracticable sense of frustration with things as they are. 8. Mention has already been made of the lack of confidence shown by the Regent in Nuri Pasha’s administration. While His Royal Highness’s behaviour , in this matter seemed at the time somewhat shortsighted, it must be allowed that he is on the whole a steadying and satisfactory influence in Iraqi politics and that his pro-British sympathies are above question. He is usually amenable to advice and determined to do his duty. That he is seriously alive to many of the problems facing his country is shown by a long memorandum which he drew up early in the year setting forth the lines on which he would wish the Govern ment to work. This was by no means a contemptible document and indicated an advance in His Royal Highness’s political capacity. It is not in his nature to inspire popular enthusiasm, and unfortunately over Kurdistan he has been stubborn in his reluctance to give Cabinet, Parliament and people any noteworthy lead towards the early implementation of a constructive policy. Nevertheless, throughout the year, he has been untiring in public appearances and military inspections all over the country. 9. The Regent’s interest in the Iraqi army has been timely Under a scheme prepared by General Renton, the new head of the British Military Mission, the army’s strength is being reduced from four to two divisions and one training division. This plan could hardly be expected to commend itself to all Ministers, especially as it involved the retirement of many old friends among the senior officers. But, except for Tahsin Ali, they accepted it under the impetus of last year’s military failures in Kurdistan. The reorganisation should improve the morale of the remaining officers, whose prospects of promotion are now better. Vigorous training is now in progress. General Renton is putting through overdue reforms which will result in better feeding and clothing of the army and a lower ] incidence of disease. The Iraqi Air Force now takes to the air more frequently , than before. Its proper role having been defined as that of army co-operation, His Majesty’s Government are selling it 30 Anson aircraft. They are to be delivered in February, 1945. , 10. In the past, the Iraqi army has been the centre of political danger and anti-British feeling. The work of General Bromilow in winning the confidence of the younger officers is now bearing fruit. The reorganisation of the Mission by General Renton, and the introduction of young British officers who have seen war service, have had an excellent effect. Some disaffection still exists but, happily, with less force. The principal use of the Army should, of course, be to maintain order in Iraq. This is now generally appreciated. The reorganisation and training now going on are popularly interpreted as preparation for a spring campaign in Kurdistan. Kurdistan. 11. Both Nuri Pasha’s Cabinet and their successors found themselves much occupied with Kurdish affairs. In January peace was made with Mulla Mustafa, the Barzani insurgent, largely through the exertions of Majid Mustafa, a Minister without portfolio charged with advising on Kurdish policy. It was an uneasv settlement and there were several occasions during the following months when a further outbreak of fighting seemed likely. 12. The Barzan troubles had, however, awakened the Government to a sense of the need for conciliatory action and they began to consider reorganisino- the [62-12] B 2 °—^— 4 grievances. INuri rasna inereaiier lwiuc ^ “*o ' , ' , tour in May spoke reassuringly to large gatherings of officials tribal leaders a notables and obtained from the mutasarrifs detailed memoranda on the admmis trative improvements, roads, schools, clinics and other works which were needed in their liwas. His Excellencv’s tours were rather too hurried. Many ot those to whom he spoke said openlf that they had heard fair promises before but had waited long in vain for their fulfilment. Nevertheless, his visits did something to improve the temper of the people. Unhappily, soon after his return tn Bagdad, his Cabinet fell and much of the good impression he had made was effaced. 13. When Hamdi Pachachi took office His Majesty’s Ambassador renewed private pressure on the Regent and his Ministers to adopt a sympathetic policy towards the Kurds and to take up the work of pacification and social and adminis trative development in the northern liwas from the point at which it had been left by the last Cabinet. Progress was, however, slow and the replacement of General Baha-ud-Din in August by a mutasarrif of the normal type caused an unfavourable impression. Meanwhile the Barzanis had established and cemented by marriage an alliance with their neighbours the Zibaris. Their control ovei the north-eastern confines of Iraq was thus complete. The state of the Iraqi army precluded for the time being the possibility of a successful punitive expedition. The Government were therefore disposed to be patient and sent Colonel 1 aufiq Wahbi, the Kurdish Minister of Economics, in September, to tour the north explaining the central administration’s good intentions. But hardly had the Minister returned to Bagdad, when Mulla Mustafa, backed by armed retainers, demanded the surrender of 100 tons of grain from a local Government head quarters. There was nothing for it but to release the grain. In December further symptoms of unrest showed themselves, of which details need not be recorded here. Mulla Mustafa’s demands of the Central Government were reported to include the fulfilment of the promises made by Nuri Pasha’s administration, the release of various Kurdish prisoners, the appointment of a Kurdish commissioner with wide powers in Bagdad and an agricultural loan” of ID.144,000 to himself. Some of the Ministers pressed for military operations but it was finally, and wisely, decided to make certain precautionary troop dispositions only. Mulla Mutafa has now retired to Barzan. In the meantime, grain and cloth have been distributed in most of the Kurdish areas. 14. This crisis and the preceding crisis—there have been quite a number of alarms—demonstrate the unsatisfactory and unstable situation which obtains in Kurdistan. Mulla Mustafa is a bandit. He is interested, not in the political or economic welfare of his people, but only in the maintenance of his feudal state. If he continues to make trouble, there would be no justification for dissuading the Iraqi Government from military action against him, provided that the opera tions are undertaken in accordance with the approval of the British Military Mission. It has been impressed upon the Iraqi Government that the Ambassador and General Officer Commanding-in-Chief expect, and are entitled to be consulted beforehand in such an event. Such consultation is essential as a precaution against a situation arising in which the use of British forces would be sought to rescue their Iraqi allies from difficulties. His Majesty’s Ambassador has, indeed, pointed out to the Iraqi authorities on numerous occasions that the latter can expect neither British assistance nor a solution of their Kurdish diffi culties so long as they delay the implementation of their promises of relief and administrative reform. Nevertheless, it must be appreciated that in the event of serious trouble in Kurdistan, it would almost certainly be necessary to deploy British troops defensively for the protection of our interests.5 Security 15. Political security remained good throughout the year. In March the case files of men interned at Amara were reviewed and twenty-nine were release. During the rest of the year 23 further internees were released from Amara Some 130 persons remain in the internment camp and it is to be anticipa that more will be released as time goes on, since the majority have already been detained for three years or more. Many of these men are, of c ? ur ®^ '° st e the Allied cause. In general it is His Majesty’s Ambassador s object to see that the more dangerous of them remain interned as long as possible. It is desirable that such releases as do take place should be made gradually a small groups so that those who are enlarged may be kept under police supervision, and to avoid the creation of a Uoc of political martyrs, which would cei tain y be exploited to our detriment once the war is over. I his policy is, in fact, bein 0 satisfactorlv carried out by the Iraq Government. 16. In April, 19 Iraqis who fled to Persia in 1941 and were there arrested by British troops and sent to Southern Rhodesia for internment, were returned to Iraq and taken into custody on various charges. Those accused of treason were tried and one (Kamil Shabib, a member of the notorious Golden Square ) was handed. Eight of these internees were subsequently released. 17 °p our Iraqis were dropped from a German aircraft on the 28th November west of Mosul. Two of these men remain at large. Arab Affairs. 18 At the beginning of the year Nuri Pasha was still pursuing the promo tion of Arab Unity. He visited Beirut and Damascus on his return from medical treatment in Palestine, and informed His Majesty’s Ambassador that he had agreed in principle with the Syrian Prime Minister that, whatever the other Arab countries might do, Iraq and Syria should establish a close understanding including a common policy for defence and foreign affairs. No such agreement has in fact been concluded; Nuri Pasha must have over-estimated the extent to which the Syrians were prepared to go forward with him. In lebruary ie Iraqi Government advanced their charge d’affaires in Syria and the Lebanon to the rank of Minister and a few weeks later a Syrian delegation, me aiding Jamil Beg Mardam, stayed for a few days in Bagdad on their way to discuss Arab unity with King Ibn Saud at Riyadh. They were cordially entertained and appropriately decorated. At the beginning of April a Lebanese delegation headed by the Prime Minister passed through Iraq on a similar mission. 1 he planning' of practical Arab co-operation was, however, left to the congress which, at that time, it was expected that the Egyptian Prime Minister womd summon during the summer. at • r&gt; u 19 Meanwhile, there was the Palestine question. In February Nuri Pasha received from Washington news of Senator Wagner’s resolution in Congress demanding that the United States Government should use their good offices to assist the creation of a Jewish State in Palestine. At his Excellency s instance, the Iraqi Presidents of the Senate and the Chamber sent telegrams of protest to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the United States Senate and to the Speaker of the House of Representatives. After an initial period of restraint, the press took up the theme in tones of moderated indignation. The Government refused applications made for permission to hold public demonstrations. The resolutions of the United States Republican and Democratic parties regarding Palestine came as a further blow. Displeasure was expressed in the newspapers, but no campaign was worked up. For this the Minister for Foreign Affairs was probably responsible. Unlike Hamdi Pachachi, who was now Prime Minister, Arshad-al- Umari is not at heart a keen pan-Arabist. His advice at this stage was that the Arabs should go gently until after the United States presidential elections, they should then try to make their case more widely known both in the United States and the United Kingdom. __ . ^ . 20 The preliminary conference on Arab Unity met at Alexandria, m September Its results were felt in this country to be unexpectedly practical, but it is doubtful whether their potential importance has yet been realised. Naturally this conference concentrated attention on the affairs of Palestine and Syria- nor was North Africa forgotten. About this time the press began to throw’off its previous restraint, thus coming more into line with the press in Palestine and Egypt. Violent comments appeared on Zionism, the Palestine problem and, in particular, the murder of Lord Moyne. Many of these effusions,6 27. During the period under review it is probably true to say that it was economic developments which chiefly occupied the minds of the people of this country. As in 1943, British war expenditure, reduced imports and lack of local which continue unabated, dealt sharply with the United States. Touching the United Kingdom, their general tone was one of friendship alloyed by nervousness. 21. Towards the end of the year Iraqi delegates attended the Arab Women s Conference in Cairo. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Nuri Said also visited that city for discussions preliminary to the Conference on Arab Unity, which, it was expected, would be held early in the New Year. 22. The Iraqi press and public are united in their hatred of Zionism, and both are apprehensive about the form any eventual Palestine settlement may take. The longer the settlement is delayed, 1 the greater the restlessness that will be felt here. The Arabs are not a match for the Jews in money, organisation or influence, and they know it. Their realisation of these facts merely increases their bitterness. Nor have the Iraqi authorities failed to notice the extent or the violence of Zionist propaganda or, in particular, the licence of the Hebrew press in Palestine—a fact which makes them unreceptive to counsels of modera tion. Zionism and the Palestine problem have not been the only subjects of indignation in the press or in discussion. French designs on Syria and the Lebanon were universally condemned. Iraq has close ties of sympathy and interest with these territories; they are not only a principal outlet for Iraqi trade and oil through the pipe-line, but also the resort of numerous well-to-do Bagdadis in the hot weather. They are of more practical importance to Iraq even, perhaps, than Palestine. Their future is therefore watched with care. It is very widely hoped in Iraq that the United Kingdom will be able to assist the Syrians to become independent of France. Latterly, however, some fears have been expressed that His Majesty’s Government’s policy in this matter may have taken the wrong turning. Foreign Relations. 23. War conditions continued to restrict Iraq’s relations with other Powers. Nevertheless, direct diplomatic relations were established with China, Czecho slovakia and Russia. The Ministers of the first two Powers live in Tehran. Relations with Russia were established on the 11th September after long searchings of heart on the part of the Iraqi Government, the leading members of which are nothing if not reactionary. The move attracted much notice and was welcomed by the press. It is understood that a M. Gregory Titovitch has been appointed as Soviet Minister, and at the time of preparing this report the Russian Consul in Kermanshah is in Bagdad searching for a legation house and other premises. It is anticipated that Soviet representation here will be on an impressive scale numerically. 24. In May the French Committee of National Liberation sent Colonel Spillman to Bagdad from Algiers to discuss the recognition of the committee by the Iraqi Government. The ensuing talks were interrupted by the fall of Nuri Pasha’s Government. Nuri’s successors were disinclined to take a decision, and, rather than dally in the heat of Bagdad, Colonej Spillman returned to Algiers. No French representation exists in this, country other than that afforded by a commercial agent whom the Iraqi Government do not officially recognise. 25. Iraqi-American relations were somewhat clouded towards the end of the year by evidences of pro-Zionism which have already been touched upon. The 1 publicity given to American plans for oil development in Arabia and the Persian Gulf attracted attention. In October a United States mission under Mr. Culbertson came to Bagdad to investigate the possibilities of American-Iraqi trade. The United States authorities have shown interest in future supplies for the Iraq State railways, and they would evidently like to see the procedure discontinued by which Iraqi Government Departments order stores through the Crown agents. In addition, Iraqi students and a representative panel of Iraqi merchants have visited America. In general, United States interest in Iraq is increasing, and with it United States propaganda. Iraq’s shortage of dollar exchange is a growing preoccupation to the Americans, who find in it a grave obstacle to the desired development of their exports to this country. 26. Towards the end of the year developments in Greece, Belgium and Italy were the subject of some public concern and doubts were cast upon the wisdom of the policy which His Majesty’s Government were pursuing towards those countries. Economics.7 (m production combined to produce a condition of limited but burdensome inflation. The currency in circulation amounted to some I.D.6 million in 1941. In October 1944 the figure stood at I.D.40-3 million. While the rate of expansion became less rapid during 1944. the general cost of living has continued to rise, causing, as might be expected, especial hardship to the urban population and the recipients of fixed incomes. The poorer Iraqis are hard put to it to clothe themselves, and, &gt; in view of the inordinate price of many common food-stuffs, particularly meat, fruit and vegetables, their diet is ill-balanced and often inadequate. 28. Acting on the pressing advice of His Majesty’s Ambassador, the Iraqi Government had set up towards the end of 1943 administrative machinery to establish rationing and to control prices, and secured the services of Colonel Bayliss from the Middle East Supply Centre to operate it. This officer embarked on his difficult task with all energy and rationing of tea, coffee and sugar began on the 1st January, while that of cotton textiles and numerous other commodities followed. Supplies of tea, sugar and coffee were large enough to enable a fairly adequate ration to be distributed, but the available quantity of the cotton cloth used for the clothing of the common people was not sufficient to provide more than about 4 metres for each person for the year, except for those who could afford to buy in the black market. Administrative corruption and the lack of experienced supply officials combined to impede the arrangements for distribution which, as a result of the haste and keenness of Colonel Bayliss and his staff at the Directorate General of Imports, were not always simple or well conceived. 29. On the 1st May Parliament passed a law creating a Ministry of Supply, thus giving effect to a scheme advocated by Colonel Bayliss for the concentration of the supply organizations hitherto dispersed among five different Departments of State. Colonel Bayliss’s anxiety to centralize this organization and to control it himself was understandable but, in the event, unfortunate. In spite of warnings, he aroused serious opposition in Ministerial and British Advisory circles and gave rise besides to many misunderstandings of M.E.S.C. policies. A series of disagreements with the Acting Minister of Supply culminated in the Colonel’s dismissal. His fall was hailed with delight by all who hoped for personal enrichment at the public expense and was felt at the time as a blow to British prestige in this country, as indeed it was. 30. The dismissal of Colonel Bayliss was followed by a relaxation of economic controls. The Government’s policy, so far as one could be discerned, was now to keep the price of essential goods low and to intercept the profits made on non-essentials, while maintaining the prices of such articles at a level sufficiently high to discourage smuggling out of the country. Mr. Grice, the present Director-General of Imports, has pursued these restricted aims quietly and with an understanding of the limitations which a primitive administrative system imposes. Meanwhile, there has been no reduction in the cost of living. A further distribution of cotton cloth (2 metres per person) is expected to take place shortly. 31. While Iraq is principally dependent on imports for her requirements of manufactured goods, she has a substantial surplus for export of certain primary products. Since 1941 it has been repeatedly made clear to the Iraq Government that the main contribution of their country to the war effort is the production of cereals, especially barley. The Iraqi Minister of Finance opened this year’s barley negotiations with an offer of over ID.18 a ton at collecting centres. This price was altogether too high. In the course of some three months discussions the Iraqi authorities were brought to a more realistic frame of mind, the price being finally fixed at ID.19/500 f.o.b. Basra cleaned and bagged, and at ID.15/000 and ID.14/500 for barley not exceeding 10 per cent, dirt on sief at Basra and Bagdad respectively. The quantity to be purchased was 200.000 tons. Though this price was very considerably lower than that paid in 1943, it was nevertheless above the world level but less than the price prevalent in other Middle Eastern areas. If the maintenance of Iraq’s economy is a political desideratum, then His Majesty’s Government were justified in paying a special price for the Iraqi barley surplus, for which there would have been no other outlet. 32. In the field of finance, mention should be made of the Bill passed by the Iraqi Parliament on the 28th May providing for two loans, one a short-term loan for ID.l million at 3 per cent., the other a long-term lottery loan at 4 per cent. The Iraqi Government sent strong delegations to the Middle East Financial Conference in April and to the International Monetary Conference held in the United States in July. In December representatives of the Treasury and Board of Trade after some weeks of successful negotiations in Egypt, allotted five and eight days respectively to Bagdad in an endeavour to persuade the Iraqi Ministerof Finance to agree to a new system of allocating dollar and other scarce foreign exchange for Iraqi s essential needs in 1945. These hurried discussions unhappily led to no result and at the close of the year no progress had been achieved. Conclusion. 33. The year 1944 saw the continuance of the good relations which subsist between Great Britain and Iraq, and it is probable that amongst Iraquis as a whole a more genuine desire exists than at any time in the past to strengthen the bonds of friendship and co-operation between the two nations. 34. As the war begins to draw to its close, however, various questions which have been held in abeyance are coming before the public notice and are causing grave anxiety to those who are interested in the preservation of Anglo-Iraqi relations. Foremost amongst such questions are the problems of Palestine and the Levant States. It was events in Palestine which produced and accelerated the deplorable deterioration of Anglo-Iraqi relations in the years 1935 to 1941. It is equally true now that good relations between Great Britain and Iraq could not survive a settlement which gave the Jews a dominating .position. Indeed, any settlement which did not safeguard what the Arabs believed to be their rights in Palestine and the Levant States would profoundly affect relations between Iraq and her ally. It seems inevitable that the Arab Unity talks in Egypt, even though they do not result in a formally constituted Confederation, will lead at least to some agreed scheme among the Arab States to oppose any unacceptable policy which may be adopted by foreign Powers. It must, unfortunately, be expected that Iraq will take a prominent part in any such plan and that her opposition which in the past has been instinctive and badly organized will in the future assume a more formidable character. 35. If, however, the end of the war sees a settlement of these questions which is not unfavourable to the Arabs, the chief political stumbling block in Anglo-Iraqi relations will have been removed, and provided that we treat the Iraqytis with wisdom, there is no reason why their present reliance on us should not continue indefinitely. But it must be remembered that complacency is always a mistake in this country and that the situation can change with dramatic suddenness. 36. The Iraqis are, at the moment, in the pleasant position of being wooed by the Americans, and it is probable that in the near future they will be made much of by the Russians as soon as the Soviet Minister takes up his abode in Bagdad. They feel nowadays that they have a definite position in the inter national scheme and that they are no longer dependent on us as they were in the past. They keep a careful watch on how we act towards their neighbours, and they are quick to notice and resent any more favourable treatment that we may give to others. 37. In these circumstances, it obviously behoves us to take nothing for granted. We must be zealous in preserving the predominant political position which we have gained, and in so acting we must realize that the Iraqis have grown up and must be treated as adults. We must take advantage of the undoubted opportunities which exist for British business enterprise, bearing always in mind that other nations are in keen competition. There are some major contracts which it is important that we should secure while a larger supply of manufactured goods to this country in exchange for its valuable primary products will both benefit our trade and assist us politically. It is worth while taking trouble over Iraq, and in this and other fields it should be treated as favourably as adjacent countries. The prompt provision of first-rate British officials for the Iraqi Government, assistance in schemes of public health and an extension of the excellent work of the British Council will also be of value. Given these things, together with the maintenance of our imperial resources, prospects are favourable for Iraq and for the strengthening of the Anglo-Iraqi connexion.of Finance to agree to a new system of allocating dollar and other scarce foreign exchange for Iraqi’s essential needs in 1945. These hurried discussions unhappily led to no result and at the close of the year no progress had been achieved. Conclusion. 33.

Sir, Bagdad, 8th February, 1944. ’ I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith, in accordance with standing instructions, a review of the major political and economic events in Iraq in 1943, which has been prepared by Mr. G. H. Thompson, counsellor to this embassy. . i , ™ 2. I am in entire agreement with the views expressed by Mr. Ihompson in the concluding two paragraphs of the enclosed paper. 3. Copies of this despatch are being sent to the Minister of State Resident in the Middle East and to the Government of India. IRAQ orovided little material for sensational head-lines in 1943. With the Z' ' the Barzan troubles, to which further reference will be made, and the usual minor (but sometimes murderous) inter-tribal affrays of no political ) f importance, internal order was well maintained. Relations between the British and Indian troops and the local population remained satisfactory. Although steadily rising prices imposed considerable difficulties on the urban populations especially, and upon officials and others in receipt of fixed incomes, a plentiful harvest and continued British war expenditures led the country as a whole to a remarkable level of domestic prosperity. Except in neglected and remote Kurdish areas there was no unemployment and no starvation. The sudden accumulation of wealth, coupled with restricted imports, inevitably resulted in widespread speculation and soaring prices, and, owing to the impact of the high cost of living on the fixed income groups, corruption attained an all-time high. The persistent political squabbling and intrigues in high places reacted seriously upon an administrative machine insufficiently geared, in any case, to cope with unforeseen and novel economic problems arising from the war. As the months passed these problems of supply and distribution became moie acute. In June the Administration, who in the previous October, under the influence of the then Minister of Finance, Saleh Jabr, had refused to contemplate such action, officially sought our help in recruiting a British expert who would function as Director-General of Imports and Economic Adviser to the High Supply Council, it being understood that he and his staff would enjoy executive powers. Unfortunately, serious delays occurred in finding a candidate for this impoitant post and it was not until towards the end of the year that Colonel Bayliss was obtained from the Middle East Supply Centre. A British officer. Colonel Le Blanc, had already earlier in the year been appointed Director-General of Transport and is still at work. In the summer a British official (Mr. Grice) became Director-General of Local Products, one of his most important tasks bein^ the application of the Cereals Control Scheme. In the purely political sphere General Nuri al Said remained Prime Minister throughout the year, and in doing so presided over several different Cabinets, each of which, howevei, contained personnel common to its predecessors. As the year waned his Excellency was being subjected to greater criticism than at any time since 1941, and the political horizon was distinctly clouded, with the Regent showing every sign of wanting a new deal not only in Iraqi politicians, but also in British advisers. Fortified by new and increased powers conferred upon the throne by -the new Organic Law enacted in the autumn. His Royal Highness, invigorated I have, &amp;c. KINAHAN CORNWALLIS. Enclosure. Political Review, 1943. General. rsi-ai2 by a highly successful official visit to the United Kingdom, seemed anxious to participate actively in the breaking and making of Cabinets. There is much to be admired in an attitude that reflects the Kegent’s patriotism and public spirit, but unfortunately His Royal Highness’s judgment of jnen does not always inspire confidence. In all these varied circumstances, the role of His Majesty s Embassy has been to act as a brake in matters political, advising steadiness and caution rather than rash experimentation, and as an accelerator in things economic, urging consistently the need for constructive action in lieu of i laissez-faire. As 1943 passed into history, no dispute ruffled the placid surface of Anglo-Iraqi relations, Anglophobia in the country and among the people as a whole appeared to be at a heavy discount, Iraq’s produce needed for the war effort had been acquired to the limits specified, and the policy of the Iraqi Royal blouse and Administration, headed by Nuri Pasha, continued to be one oi lull co-operation with the British ally in all essential directions. Iraq Enters the War. 2. At midnight on the 16th January Iraq became an active participant in the Allied struggle against Nazi-Fascist world revolution. A few days later she acceded to the United Nations Pact signed at Washington on the 2nd January, 1942. 3. Nuri Pasha would have liked to have taken these steps a year or so earlier. Allied reverses in 1942, and the general uncertainty of the situation until the tide turned against the Axis at El Alamein and Stalingrad, made it desirable to wait and see. When the moment finally came, the decision to enter the war aroused no opposition, but small enthusiasm. It was preceded by ten days or more of a press and radio campaign stressing the great benefits certain to accrue to Iraq from belligerency, and there was much ado, in particular, about the Atlantic Charter. Nothing was said in all this propaganda about the new obligations Iraq assumed as a member of the United Nations, so that in ensuing weeks it proved necessary to remind the Prime Minister and other personalities of realities in this connexion, the columns of the Iraq Times and Basra Times also being used for this purpose. Once the masses in the towns, and particularly in Bagdad, had grown accustomed to the idea of involvement in the war-—which, in the absence of any reaction on the part of the enemy, they did fairly rapidly— they probably gave the subject but few thoughts. To a great many other persons, however, including tribal leaders and the more solid elements who had remained quiescent in 1941, so that Rashid Ali then failed to enjoy anything like the majority support he had expected, Nuri’s policy was welcome as at least a partial atonement for the tragic errors of two years previously. It would be too much to expect that this feeling should make the idea of loss and sacrifice in the cause attractive, and it is, in fact, fortunate that, except for minor discomforts, the country has not so far been called upon to bear a very grave burden. Few men or women who are normal beings like war, and it would be unnatural, indeed, if people as a whole here failed to register satisfaction that the threat of invasion, which in the summer of 1942 was so acute, has since receded almost to vanishing- point. 4. While in certain unthinking quarters Iraq’s declaration of war was greeted with the “ loud guffaw that bespeaks the vacant mind,” the event in fact caused a considerable impression throughout the Middle East and certainly redounded to our credit. In Egypt it created considerable surprise and annoyance for a time, chiefly because it seemed that somehow Iraq had stolen a march on the remainder of the Arab world. In practice, Iraqi belligerency has been of considerable use in various ways and should continue to prove of value, perhaps especially when the time comes for the United Nations to turn their attention seriously towards Japan. 5. Inspired by his dreams about Iraq’s place at the peace table as well as by his desire to keep in the van of the Arab States, Nuri Pasha sought more than once to despatch Iraqi troops abroad for service in some sphere of operations under British command. Preparations for the formation of a special brigade, composed mainly of volunteers, were in fact actually begun. His Excellency’s most serious attempt—and also his last for the time being—was made in the late summer, when he offered this brigade for service in Syria to assist in the maintenance of “ internal order.” He was naturally warned at once that there would be grave political objections to the presence of Iraqi troops in Syria, and in due course the proposal was courteously rejected by His Majesty’s Government, who, however, had previously examined the possibility of employing the brigade on occupational duties in liberated North African territory. By the time the scheme was finally dropped many of the elements of the brigade had been sent3 north to cope with the rebel tribesmen of Mulla Mustafa, a task which pio\ed completely beyond their capacity. It was found that the r ^ en were quite untrained for mountain operations and, furthermore, that they had no heart in the business. The truth is that the Iraqi army, the reorganisation ot which continues to hang fire, has never recovered from the sad events of 1941. Its morale is shot to pieces, all too many of its officers are lazy, arrogant and inefficient, and it is unpopular in the country. It is possibly at the time qt ' writing the last focus of anti-British infection. Powerless at the moment, it remains a potential but remote menace to the domestic peace of the country. Enemy Propaganda and A ction. 6. The former has dwindled steadily and may scarcely be said to anc ^ ] enemy sympathisers find it wise to lie very low. Of the latter, the only , noticeable manifestation was the dropping in June in the north of three German parachutists, accompanied by a young Iraqi. Their objectives appear to have been espionage, sabotage and subversive activities among the Kurdish tribes. All were apprehended after a week or two, since when they have been extensively examined by the British authorities. It is expected that they will in due course be tried by the Iraqi authorities. During the year a considerable number of political internees were released from the Amarah concentration camp, but OI i|y in one case was a really dangerous character set at provisional liberty, and he was shortly afterwards reinterned. At the end of the year arrangements were under consideration for the return to Iraq for trial of the internees in Southern Rhodesia. Internal Politics. 7. It was not until the 23rd June that the Cabinet formed by Nuri Pasha in October 1942 was reshuffled after a life of about eight months. This was a fairly long run as Cabinets go in Iraq and, in retrospect, it may be said that the period of this particular Administration was not altogether barren of achieve ment. It passed the new “ Law for the Regulation of Economic Life,” which conferred wide powers upon the Government, it fixed the price of cereals, it embarked on and largely carried through arduous negotiations for the sale of 200,000 tons of barley to 'His Majesty’s Government, it appointed a British officer as Director-General of Transport, and it made considerable progress m various other directions which need not be described in detail. It fell for the reason that the great majority of Iraqi Cabinets fall, namely, as the result of quarrels between certain of its members. In this particular instance it was Saleh Jabi, the Minister of Finance, who upset the apple-cart. He resented the Prime Minister’s opposition to his proposed grant of several thousand acres oj. Government land to an old friend, and for other reasons he fell out with tne Minister of Justice and quarrelled with the Minister of Education, a coarse and stupid personality, who unluckily then became Rais of the Royal Diwan. But there were other and more unfortunate consequences. Saleh Jabi went back to the Ministry of the Interior, in which he had previously been a great success, and was succeeded in linance by Jalal Baban. Ibis appointment, which turned out to be a catastrophic failure, since the new Minister proceeded to sabotage the Government’s policy of economic control, was a typical example oi General Nuri’s apparently irresistible tendency to “ appease ” critics and opponents in the usually illusory belief that they will be tamed by the responsibilities of office. From the moment that new and cc reformed ” Cabinet was announced the political horizon began to grow hazy with the mists of personal intrigue and obstruction, which the approach of the elections scheduled for September did nothing to dismpate^ ^ j u iy } a brief bout of pneumonia rapidly and effectively dealt with by “ 693,” the Prime Minister proceeded to the Lebanon to recuperate and later visited Syria, Palestine, Egypt and Iransjordan. On his return on the 10th August his Excellency found renewed Cabinet trouble awaiting him. This time the Minister for Foreign Affairs and other Ministers were resentful because they had not been consulted in advance about General Nuri s conversa tions in Egypt and elsewhere on Arab unity. This difficulty was patched up, but five weeks later—by which date the Prime Minister was again indisposed and on the point of leaving for the Mount Carmel Sanatorium in Palestine—a much more serious squall blew up. This was a dispute with the Regent over the lists of candidates for election to Parliament. On the 28th September His Roval Highness was sufficiently worked up to be contemplating dismissing the Cabinet lock, stock and barrel, but his choice of a new team headed by the I ord Mayor of Bagdad left so much to be desired that His Majesty s Ambassador [51-5] ° B 2- felt compelled to counsel caution. Discussions between the Regent and the Prime Minister continued until the 4th October, when agreement was reached through the acceptance by the Cabinet of 99 out of 105 names on the Pa ace electoral list. The Ministers of Finance and Interior, however, immediately resigned and so followed their colleague of Foreign Affairs who had already gone out of office. The vacancy in Interior was at once filled by a newcomer to Cabinet rank (the comparatively youthful Abdulla Qassab, Mutessarii oi Diwaniyah), the other two posts being left vacant for the time being, and the elections duly took place without incident throughout the country on tiie 5th and 6th October. i „ ,, , i 9. The newly-elected legislature did not differ materially from the old, some sixty-five members of which were returned. While many of these had, under duress, supported Rashid Ali in 1941, all convinced adherents of the latter’s Anglophobe policy were eliminated. In a country where life counts tor little, and where nepotism and the more elementary and obvious forms of corruption are viewed with greater toleration than in Britain, it was no surprise to find in the new Parliament one or two murderers and a few other dubious characters 10. On the 28th October the Regent, accompanied by the Iraqi Acting Chief of the General Staff, Dr. Sinderson and an aide-de-camp, left by air on an official visit to the United Kingdom. Arrangements had previously been made for his uncle, the Amir Zaid, to return from Istanbul to function as Acting Regent during His Royal Highness’s absence. This is not the place to describe the° Regent’s stay in Britain. It will suffice to say that, arriving on the 4th November, he found an excellent programme awaiting him, had the honour of being entertained by Their Majesties The King and Queen for two days at Buckingham Palace and left on the 2nd December. His Royal Highness returned safely to Bagdad on the 13th December, having greatly enjoyed, and been impressed by, his weeks in England, which enabled him to form a persona appreciation of the extent and scope of the British war effort. 11 It is perhaps worth recording that the Regent had hoped to combine the above visit with one to the United States. After mature consideration over a period of months, however, the United States Government regretted their inability to receive him and mentioned as an excuse the perils of a tians Atlantic air passage in winter. Actually, it seems likely that they wished to concentrate on more potentially-valuable game in the persons of two sons of Ibn Saud, whose oil-bearing kingdom is now arousing much interest m America The two Saudi Arabian Princes arrived in London on their way home from the United States while the Regent was still there. Cards were exchanged, but no other contacts occurred. was res ting in Palestine between the Hth and 23rd October. On his return and after the departure of the Regent, it at last bj c ^ me P 08 ® 10 e to oin his Excellency down for a frank and lengthy discussion of the problems of the hour, and this'took place on the 30th October. His Majesty s Ambassador who spoke in no uncertain terms, complained particularly of the Persistent failure of the Government to deal with the economic crisis and of the steady deterioration in the morale and capabilities of the administrative services. Reference was also made to the low tone of public life and to the mishandling of the Kurdish question. The Prime Minister was strongly urged to get down to brass tacks 8 with out delav, for now was the time for reform and modernisation. He took these blunt remonstrances well, gave assurances of his anxi^ to improve matters and intimated his desire to call upon the services of an additional number of British experts in general administration, agriculture, forestry, co-operative societies 0 ed on the 9th October and soon passed the new Organic Taw ’ Notice was also given of the coming introduction of a new electoral law Pi^ittin- tU establishment of political parties.

Although the new Cabinet undoubtedly included men oi ability it contained no progressive elements and was representative of the old ruling class of established families. It aroused a storm of criticism throughout the country, while the Regent made no concealment of his dislike. As the y 6 ^ 1 * Cosed, l\ uri Pasha was once more indisposed and contemplating yet another period ox recuperation in Palestine, and the general political outlook was contusea ou uncertain in the extreme. , , A ^ 15. All observers of the Iraqi political scene are agreed that there is a caving need for new blood in the councils of State. The difficulty, however, is to find it. It is unhappily a fact that, even in normal times, there are only a limited number of men in this country at all suitable for the responsibilities of hmh office, and since 1941 their number has been reduced by the absence in enemy territory or concentration camps of keen-witted but mistaken men who, in that year, took the wrong turning. Under existing conditions it is very difficult for promising young men to come to the fore and, as it were, catch the Sneaker’s eye. The proposed new electoral law is being framed with a view i q removing 1 the obstacles that to-day impede the advance of the rising genera tion. and it may be hoped that, if or when passed, this measure will live up to the hopes it enshrines. It it proves a failure, then it can only lie a mattei of time and opportunity before trouble occurs. There is undoubtedly growing weariness of the “ old gang,” which one day is likely to find violent expression in some form or another. Arab Unity. 16 This is the darling ambition of General Nuri, and much was heard about it during the first half of the year particularly. Since then, and apart from constant references to the subject in the vernacular press which has a ^o displayed concern over the Arab population of North Africa to which area it is desired that the principles of the Atlantic Charter should be applied—there has not been so much activity. The idea of a general conference to plan the future of the Arab world did not go down in Egypt and elsewhere as well as was anticipated, and in March and April, when Jamil Madfai visited &gt; yna, Transjordan and Egypt as the Prime Minister’s special envoy he was rather disappointed by his reception. Later, m the summer, Nun himself went o Cairo and conferred with Nahas Pasha. He hoped to visit North Africa as well, but this plan was discouraged by the Fighting French and came to nothing. 17 While there is, therefore, but little in the way of concrete achievement on Pan-Arabism to report, this does not mean that the question is by any manner of means moribund. Ear from it. The Lebanese crisis in the late autumn powerfully stimulated the growing feeling of fellowship among Arabs and i ifn Iraq the Government, press and people behaved with restraint it \\as primarily owing to the widespread conviction that British policy and Britis opinion were on the Arab side. That the repressive and even violent attitude of the French aroused so unanimous an outcry throughout the Arab world is a sip-nificant illustration of the reaction to be expected if or when the Palestine oioblem becomes acute. At the moment, Arab hopes centre m the maintenance of the White Paper policy, any drastic modification of which would have the i. strong, trod th.ro ,llu.it- .bout the subversive prsp.r.tion. of Fascist methods of organisation enforced by them.

In July M. Maisky, who was on his way to Moscow by air, spent a few hours in Bagdad attired in a sports jacket and grey flannel trousers, with the result that he came near to collapsing from the heat. In October his Excellency, accompanied by Mme. Maisky, spent two days here on his way to Tabriz by road via Tehran. On this occasion he tackled the Prime Minister about the establish ment of relations with Iraq and found him reasonably accommodating. While General Nuri declined to follow the Egyptian precedent of a written request for the exchange of representatives, he agreed to this idea in principle, and later, when Parliament was opened, the Speech from the Throne contained a brief statement that the establishment of relations might be expected in due course. This statement aroused much interest, but no opposition. 21. In conversations at His Majesty’s Embassy M. Maisky spoke with remarkable frankness. Inter alia he said he envisaged a Regional Council for the Middle East with Soviet membership. He also viewed American oil enterprise in Arabia with some concern, and in general rather gave the impres sion that the Russian mind is yet suspicious of the right wing in Britain and “ big business ” in the United States. The Barzan Tribal Disorders. 22. In July Mulla Mustafa, a well-known Barzani tribal leader, who for some years had been residing under compulsion at Sulaimani on a meagre Government allowance, escaped and made his way back to his remote and mountainous native area in Kurdistan. His advent led to an armed outbreak which provided forceful evidence of the discontent which had long been simmering in these neglected districts. In September the Mulla was joined by the Turkish outlaw Said Birokhi and a number of Iraqi fugitives. Towards the end of the month attacks were made on a number of police posts in the vicinity of Mergasur, north-west of Rowanduz. Police reinforcements fared ill at the hands of the tribesmen, and withdrew in some confusion after suffering losses in men and arms. This was the beginning of a series of attacks on isolated Govern ment posts, a number of which were evacuated, while others surrendered. Drastic action was taken on the Turkish side, and before the end of October Said Birokhi had been killed and his followers dispersed. On the Iraqi side preparations for punitive military action went forward, and a force of about one mixed brigade was concentrated round Rowanduz and to the north-west. 23. These events apparently led Mulla Mustafa to think, and he contacted the Iraqi officer commanding troops in a conciliatory manner. Various exchanges followed, and, after His Majesty’s Ambassador had secured from Nuri Pasha certain assurances concerning the future treatment of the Barzani chiefs, his Excellency advised the Mulla to surrender. His reply was a categorical refusal. 24. On the 6th November Iraqi troops embarked on what was described as a “ reconnaissance in force ” from Mergasur in the direction of the Greater Zab River, the head of the British Military Mission and the Iraqi Chief of the General Staff being with the column, which soon met with such resistance that it retired with loss to its starting point. Two days later a similar initiative was also repulsed, while on the 10th November a military convoy was only extricated with difficulty and at some cost from a serious ambush. It became painfully clear that the Iraqi military and police, who revealed themselves as ill-led, ill-trained and of low T morale, were incapable of restoring the situation, which continued to deteriorate. In December it proved necessary, to calm the apprehen sions of Iraqi Royal Air Force Levy families isolated in Diana and another village north of Rowanduz, to despatch a company of Indian infantry, a mortar company and a Bren carrier company, plus a section of Royal Air Force armoured cars, for their protection. 25. In Bagdad there was some alarm in political circles. His Majesty’s Ambassador pointed out to the Regent, the Prime Minister and others that, since the Iraqi Government were clearly incapable of bringing Mulla Mustafa to heel by force, they would have to exploit conciliatory political action to the full. This attitude met with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, who in December suggested that Mulla Mustafa might be warned in emphatic terms that his antics were becoming an embarrassment to the British war effort. This warning was issued on the 21st December and extracted a conciliatory reply six days later, in which the Mulla undertook to keep the peace, &amp;c., if he were pardoned, his imprisoned followers released and his grievances investigated. 26. Meanwhile, the latest of General Nuri’s Cabinets, containing a Kurdish Minister without portfolio, Majid Mustafa, had been formed on theZl 7 25th December. The whole position was discussed with him at length and in detail. On the 1st January, 1944, he proceeded north, accompanied by two Kurdish officers, to meet Mulla Mustafa in person for further negotiations and to convert the truce already ordered by the latter into a complete cessation of hostilities. By the end of the year, therefore, events were taking a promising turn with reasonably bright prospects not only of the restoration of order in the affected areas, but also of a serious attempt being made to cope with long-ignored but legitimate tribal grievances. Economics. 27. Iraq is caught between the devil of major British military and other war expenditure in the country and the deep sea of drastically curtailed imports. As a result, not only has the currency in circulation expanded from 6 million dinars in 1941 to 34 million dinars at the end of 1943, but the general cost of living has risen most drastically. The consequence has been a form of inflation which, as it began to develop seriously in 1942, not unnaturally caused grave concern in Cairo and London, especially as it was accompanied by the evils of speculation, profiteering, corruption and hoarding. Great pressure has therefore been exerted, not altogether without success, to persuade the Iraqi Government to put their house in order, especially with regard to the control of prices and the distribution of imported material, produce and commodities. At the same time, it has been necessary to secure, on the most favourable terms possible, vitally needed quantities of Iraqi cereals—chiefly barley—dates, &amp;c., for the war effort. 28. As regards grains, there was finally concluded on the 23rd July a formal contract between His Majesty’s Government and the Government of Iraq for purchase of 200,000 tons of barley at 20^ dinars per ton. The negotiation of this contract took many weeks of arduous labour, involving long hours of discussion, chiefly with the Prime Minister and Ministers of Finance and Interior, whose opening bids on price had been 24 dinars or more. The final result was considered satisfactory in London and Cairo, and by the end of the year the contract had been largely if not entirely fulfilled, over 100,000 tons having been despatched to India in relief of famine^ conditions in Bengal. For the rest, the establishment of a ceiling for cereal prices in Iraq was undoubtedly a most important steadying factor in the general economic situation, for it cannot be doubted that in the absence of any such fixed price the internal cost level would have soared. I A further restraining factor on the rise of commodity prices was the conclusion I of an arrangement in the summer, whereby a British firm purchased for account ; of the Ministry of Food the entire surplus of Basra dates at fixed prices | considerably lower than those ruling in other parts of the country. 29. As regards imports and internal distribution, the Government—armed with ample powers by the new “ Law for the Regulation of Economic Life ”— finally agreed in June to recruit the services of an outside expert, who would be granted executive powers as Director-General of Imports and Economic Adviser to the High Supply Council. Unfortunately, months of delay occurred before a candidate for this post was obtained by the release from the Middle East Supply Centre of Colonel Bayliss, who, with a staff of five other officers, took up his appointment in November. He was accorded the fullest possible support by the Iraqi authorities and all others concerned, including the British advisers, and at once set about his task with the utmost energy. Indeed, he went a trifle too fast and, being at the same time disinclined to seek or follow advice, met with certain difficulties that might have been avoided. Nevertheless, by the end of the year Colonel Bayliss was still pushing on at speed, and if on occasion his methods seemed a shade theoretical—0-£7-&gt; the rationing ol tea and coffee, which weie in fair supply and not too expensive, in minute amounts per head—he had already accomplished most valuable progress in drawing up Iraq’s requirements for 1944 and in controlling the cost of a wide variety of articles. Furthermore, his obvious determination to check profiteering had a beneficial effect on the general prices of imported goods, manv of which showed declines by the end of the year ranging from 15 to 40 per cent.; and the cost of living index fell from 405 in November to 376 in early January. Certainly his most difficult task will be to ensure an adequate supply and distribution at reasonable prices of cotton piece- goods, the shortage of which formed a constant subject of Iraqi complaint throughout the year. . , 30. Having regard to the fundamental nature of the two factors mentioned in the first sentence of paragraph 27, it is hard to resist the conclusion that such initiatives as the sale of gold as a commodity to absorb surplus purchasing power can be but palliatives. Gold sales opened in Iraq at the beginning of August8 and have proceeded ever since to the accompaniment of daily telegrams to Beirut, Bombay, Cairo, Jerusalem, London and Tehran. These sales have earned the Treasury in Whitehall a useful profit. But here in Iraq they have had no discernible effect on the price level and but a negative one on the currency in circulation, the total of which might to-day be a million or so more than it actually is if no gold had been sold. At the time of writing the Minister of Finance is said to be seriously considering lottery or other loans, in which he hopes the public may be tempted to invest surplus funds. The sale of Government loans is also under consideration with the same object, but this is a matter which will require to be handled very carefully indeed in view of the tribal interests involved. Conclusion. 31. The experience of the past year has once again proved the high value of British policy towards this country. Iraq, indeed, to-day represents a political experiment the success of which has been so great up to date that it passes well nigh unnoticed, and so there is danger of its being taken as a matter of course. This is much to be deprecated. Although there is at present no demand for any revision of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, nor any wilful obstruction of British wishes by the Iraqi Government or people, it would be a grave error to suppose that we can safely sit back and relax either our constant political or economic watchfulness or our effective public relations work. The scene in this country can change with startling rapidity and complacency is not consequently to be desired. Indeed, as the events of 1943 tend to show, problems in Iraq will increase in number and complexity as the war recedes farther and farther from the Middle East. In the circumstances it may be hoped that there will be no tendency to assume that, because for the last three years Iraq has given no trouble, she may safely be discriminated against in favour of more tiresome or more powerful or more noisy neighbours. The Iraqis watch very carefully what goes on in Egypt, in Persia, even in Turkey and Syria, and they easily resent others receiving greater apparent benefits at British hands than they seem to do. Rightly or wrongly, ' there was in 1943 a disposition—not altogether confined to Iraqis—to feel that, in comparison with Egypt and Persia in particular, this kingdom did less well | than she had a right to expect. Although it has not yet become known here, the fact that twelve Persian officers are, for example, being trained by the Royal Air Force in the United Kingdom free, gratis and for nothing cheek by jowl with six young Iraqi brothers-in-arms who will each cost their Government £5,000, may one day be hard to explain convincingly. It is essential, if we are to retain and develop our valuable stake in this country, which is important to us politically and strategically and economically, to lose no opportunity of convincing its inhabitants that their close associations with Britain redound to their own concrete and material benefit 32. Iraq is likely to emerge from the present world war in a prosperous condition and, from our point of view, with a more healthy outlook than ever before. The latter will be in part due to the fact that it is becoming more and more widely appreciated here that small countries incapable of defending themselves must have powerful friends if their independence is to enuiiie and their politico-economic development to go forward. This must not, however, be taken to imply that Iraq will be prepared to play the humble role of an uncomplaining poor relation. The country is rich in undeveloped resources, especially agricultural, and should provide a valuable post-war market for manufactured goods, engineering products, &amp;c. It ought to be possible for us to take full advantage of many new opportunities for British enterprise. But initiative and investment will be necessary, and some risks will also have to be run. Now that post-war planning has actually begun in Iraq (projected railway developments, the proposed Bekhme dam, the establishment of new local industries such as, for example, modern tanneries), we should lose no time m studying possibilities. Others are already doing so, and in this connexion if perhaps worth adding that the Americans particularly are carefully surveying the whole position. Moreover, they are not blind to the importance of securing goodwill in advance. In 1943 much interest was aroused m Bagdad by a rumour that some United States foundation was contemplating building a new hospital and medical research institute in Iraq.

IN accordance with the instructions contained in Viscount Halifax s ^ s 0 despatch of the 4th November, 1939, I have the honour to submit the toilowing/, review of the chief events in Iraq during 1942, which is the work of air. Johp^ Chaplin, second secretary at this embassy :— *■ 2. After the storms of 1941 it is pleasant to be able to record that the surface of the political waters during 1942 was ruffled only by periodic breezes and occasional sharper squalls. There were anxious moments when it seemed that the Prime Minister’s leaky craft might founder, but in the event it came safely through the year. It would be tedious to chronicle all the many changes in the crew or the reasons—often personal and trivial—which led to them. Apart from the trial and execution of the rebel leaders, to which I shall refer more^ ft“l&gt; below, there were no further really dangerous waters to be negotiated. These once safely navigated (with but a single casualty), the subsequent recurrent Cabinet crises illustrated the inability of Iraqi public men to put their country, even in the hour of danger, before personal animosities, private gain, family ties or sectarian interests. They showed up, too, the lamentable dearth of able, honest administrators considered eligible for Cabinet rank. General Nuri-al-Said began the year with a Cabinet of two capable men, Saleh Jabr and Ali Mumtaz, five mediocrities; at the end of the year Saleh Jabr and one of the original medio crities, Tahsin Ali (under notice of transfer to the post of Rais of the Royal Diwan) alone remained, and five different mediocrities were neglecting or mis managing the affairs of their departments. I he Prime Minister endeavoured on more than one occasion to recruit Ibrahim Kemal and r I aufiq Suwaidi, the two outstanding men among ex-Ministers; but the former still nursed an apparently implacable grudge, while the latter formulated unacceptable conditions, patently designed to secure himself a position from which he could intrigue against the Prime Minister and eventually oust him from office. Inevitably, therefore, the main burden of administration rested throughout the year on the shoulders of General Nuri and Saleh Jabr, the latter first as Minister of the Interior and subsequently as Minister of Finance in the new Cabinet formed by the same Prime Minister after the resignation of the old in early October. 3. During the first half of the year the main preoccupation of the Govern ment was with the aftermath of the events of May 1941. In the penultimate paragraph of my review for 1941 I anticipated that General Nuri would continue his efforts to restore a healthier atmosphere. With the vast improvement in the military situation and the presence of a considerable body of British troops in Iraq the possibility of organised trouble has virtually vanished, and it is now right to give the Prime Minister his due for the resolution which he showed in darker days. On the 8th Januarv the court-martial which had been set up to try in absentia Rashid Ali and his associates delivered judgment, whereby Rashid Ali. Ali Mahmud-al-Shaikh Ali, Yunus Sabawi and three out of the four members of the “ Golden Square ” were sentenced to be hanged, the ex-Chief of General Staff, Amin Zaki, to life imprisonment and three others to different terms; the hearing of the charges against the fourth member of the Golden Square and a number of others was postponed on the ground that the accused had wished to o-ive themselves up for trial, but had been prevented from doing so. Following upon this verdict the Prime Minister approached me to secuie the surrender of those of the accused who had been apprehended in Persia on the entry of the British forces. After careful consideration, I came to the conclusion that, on balance comnliance with a formal request (which was duly forthcoming with the hack in 0, of the Cabinet as a whole) would be advisable in so far at least as those alreadv convicted were concerned. It seemed to me that the desirability of enabling the Government to give effect to its declared policK of rr'wintinni niatwflighfld, [39 82] nSSTpM.TSn | «NU»E , N WEEKLY tlTTlf No, 1 $ lyAPlt ^4.5 .

I recommended to you accordingly and arrangements were duly made for the return to Iraq oi those who had been sentenced in absentia. Meanwhile, Japanese successes in the r ar East had given the signal for a dangerous recrudescence of subversive activities, which at the beginning of the year had seemed to have been checked; the autho rities, however, reacted with energy, rounding up a gang of Palestinian and IraqVj terrorists on the 5th February and arresting later in the month for internment Fao twenty-five serving or pensioned army officers and twenty civilians. Steps were also taken to tighten up conditions of internment, and the help of the British military authorities was invoked to assist in the preparation of a new camp at Amara. 4. On the 13th March the former Colonels Fahmi Said and Mahmud Salman of the Golden Square, the ex-Chief of the General Staff, Amin Zaki Sulaiman, with Ali Mahmud-al-Shaikh Ali, Yunus Sabawi and Sadiq Shanshal were brought back to Basra and handed over into Iraqi military custody. Their re-trial in person before court-martial began on the 18th March and proved a long-drawn-out affair. Fortunately, the Prime Minister had obtained from his Cabinet colleagues satisfactory assurances of their determination to see things through. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdullah Damaluji, did indeed absent himself from public business on a plea of illness when the Regent refused to accept his resigna tion, and Tahsin Ali showed signs of wavering. Nevertheless, the expected volume of pressure in favour of this or that prisoner or all did not materialise; i rather, as the trial proceeded and public interest was stimulated by press reports of the hearings, opinion in general hardened against the accused. The unanimous verdict of the court, eventually delivered on the 4th May, condemned Fahmi Said, Mahmud Salman and Yunus Sabawi to death; Ali Mahmud-al-Shaikh Ali to seven years’ and Amin Zaki to five years’ imprisonment. The death sentences were executed in the early hours of the following day. Sadiq Shanshal, whom the tribunal acquitted, was at once rearrested and interned. This issue, which provoked no violent reaction and, indeed, met with a wide measure of approval, produced an undoubted salutary effect and will, it may be hoped, tend in future to deter unscrupulous politicians' and ambitious officers from attempting to over throw the constitutional order. It should be recorded that, after the conclusion of the trial, the Iraqi Government half-heartedly renewed from time to time, but did not press, their request for the delivery to them of those rebels in the custody of His Majesty’s Government whose original trial had, as recorded above, been postponed. One of them—Naji Suwaidi, Minister of Finance in Rashid Ali s Administration and brother of Taufiq Suwaidi—'died in internment in Southern | Rhodesia during August. The others remain as potential foci of embarrassment ’ in times to come. . . 5. Meanwhile, our security authorities had been engaged in preparing a list of the most dangerous characters still at liberty. On the 22nd May I presented this list, containing seventy-five names, to the Minister of the Interior and urged the internment of the men in question. Immediate results were not forthcoming, but I maintained constant pressure; Rommel’s advance in Egypt probably hastened the eventual decision, for with the grave deterioration in the military situation the dangers of fifth-column activity became correspondingly more acute. Eventually, on the 5th July, thirty-five suspects were rounded up and sent to the internment camp at Amara, followed a few days later by further trouble-makers from the Mosul district. This action of the Minister of the Interior, though not quite as extensive as had been hoped, nevertheless, exerted a steadying influence at a difficult time and checked pro-Axis activities and propaganda which had been tending to revive. It also all but caused the disruption of the Cabinet, who had not been taken into the confidence of General Nuri and Saleh Jabr over the proposed arrests; the Minister of Finance, Ali Mumtaz, was particularly aggrieved—he was concurrently quarrelling with the Minister of the Interior over supply matters—and was only with the greatest difficulty persuaded to withdraw his resignation. Prior consultation with the full Cabinet would inevitably have resultecf in immunity for a number of dangerous men. protected by this Minister or that, and it is well that the Prime Minister would concede no more than that the Cabinet should be informed of arrests which had been decided just before they were carried out. He was also fully prepared, should the German threat to the Middle East develop further, to proceed to a wide range of additional arrests in order to neutralise such potential fifth column as still remained. A number of additional single internments did, in fact, take place, but, with the 8th Army’s stand at Alamein and the holding of the German drive in the Caucasus, the like-lihood of military operations taking place in or near Iraq receded and ^ demonstrable necessity for severer security measures. 1 he Prime Minister, indeed, began to play with ideas of clemency, for which there was no justification to be found even in the admittedly striking turn in the course of the war; true, the great mass of waverers in Iraq came finally to the conclusion in November ant December that the United Nations would be victorious, the risk of a pro-Axis ' upheaval vanished and pro-Axis propagandists no longer had an eager ant Uncritical hearing, but releases from internment could only serve to promote clandestine subversive and anti-British activities. In mid-November e engineered a demand in the Senate for the release of political prisoners. ^Me Jabr, Minister of Finance in Nuri’s second Cabinet, energetically defended the action he had taken as Minister of the Interior, but the Prime Minister weakened so far as to appoint a committee of three to review all the cases. As a, result, out of 311 internees, thirty were released against personal security for tuture good behaviour and a further five were transferred to residence jorcee at Qalat baleh. The releases thus ordered are not likely in themselves to disturb internal tranquil lity, but the Prime Minister had been left in no doubt of the view of His Majesty s Government that the time is quite unsuited—especially when vigorous action against hoarders and profiteers is an urgent need—to the development of a policy of appeasement. . , • 6. If the general internal situation can be regarded as ha\ing been factory throughout the year, the cleaning of all the Augean stables which the ' Government had inherited did not proceed with equal determination and ceienn. The Prime Minister, as Minister of Defence, continued to lend his personal atten tion to the purging of the army. He professes in the main to be satisfied with the results, and it is certainly true that the senior officers have shown themselves friendly and co-operative in their dealings with the British military authorities; at the same time reports of the continued prevalence of anti-British tendencies and activities, particularly among the junior officers, have been so circumstantial and so persistent that it is impossible to discount them wholly. I he Minister ot Justice for one, considers the army to be still completely unreliable and is reported to have advised the Regent that it should be disbanded and replaced by a o-endarmerie force under the Ministry of the Interior. For myself, I think that n&lt;? little progress has in fact been made, though much doubtless remains to be accomplished. In the field of education Professor Hamley, after many delays and hesitations, eventually accepted the post of technical expert in the Ministry ot Education with a mission to reorganise the whole educational system of Iraq. He found himself thwarted at almost every turn by Dr. Sami Shaukat and, more particularly, by Dr. Fadhil Jamali, the two joint Directors-General, who despite their black record, were maintained in office, the former by his friendship with the Prime Minister, the latter by Shia influence. Eventually, General Nun was forced to the conclusion that they must go and, after lengthy and sometimes acrimonious negotiations with the Egyptian Government, succeeded m obtaining the loan of Sadiq Jowhar to be advisory head of the department; the arrival ot the latter was awaited at the end of the year. In other administrations, too, there is still much room for improvement. The Directorate-General ot Jails is a glaring example, about which I have spoken to the Prime Minister on more than one occasion. The courts, where magistrates are far too prone to acquit, or inflict derisory sentences on .offenders deserving of exemplary punishment, are another. 7 ^ All this will take determination, time and patience to remedy. Untor- tunately the Prime Minister, forceful and quick to action though he can be in an emergency, is prone to relax among his dreams so soon as the emergency is oyer and is also temperamentally averse from grappling with the mass of adminis trative problems which still clamour for solution, and which his col eagues-Saleh ijabr apart'—are too incompetent or too indolent to tackle. With en ough an more than enough to occupy him at home, he tended increasingly through 1942 o turn his thoughts to external policy. The signature at Washington of the United Nations’ Declaration on the 2nd January caught his imagination at once, and he jbe°-an to toy with the idea of Iraqi adherence and a declaration of war on the \xis Powers Nor did the rejection by King Abdul Aziz of the suggestion of His Majesty’s Government that Saudi Arabia should take such action influence him against this course, from which he was convinced that Iraq stood much tp gam Pending the trial of the rebels and later during the British retreat m the Western Desert the scheme was shelved, but with the turn in the development of the war was promptly resuscitated. On the 12th November the Chamber of Deputies voted by a two-thirds majority a resolution calling on the Government to adhere [39—82] ® 2to the declaration. The resolution had been inspired by General Nuri, who, fortified by this “ parliamentary pressure,” went on to seek the approval of His Majesty’s Government for the step in contemplation. He had already in March obtained an assurance that belligerency would not involve Iraq in any further commitments than those which she was already discharging under the Anglo- Iraqi Treaty, namely, the provision of facilities in Iraqi territory : and that the extension of these facilities to the United Nations would qualify her for adherence to the declaration. The initiative could hardly be discouraged (though Ir belligerency would entail no military advantage for the Allies), and at the close of the year the formal means of giving effect to it were under consideration, while the Prime Minister had set in motion a preparatory propaganda campaign. 8. The highest ethical motives did not underlie General Nuri’s yearnings after war with the Axis Powers. Convinced of the ultimate defeat of the latter, his aim was to secure the most advantageous position for Iraq and the Iraqi Government at the kill. There was no substantial immediate advantage to be reaped after the United States Government had extended Lend-Lease to Iraq on the 2nd May, but his eyes have always easily wandered in search of wider horizons. II faut cultiver notre jar din is not a political philosophy which appeals to him, and increasingly through the latter part of the year he reverted to his old preoccupation of ” Arab aspirations.” When Mr. Churchill passed over Iraq in August without making a halt General Nuri, who was much hurt, no doubt felt that an opportunity had been missed, but he did not fail, in acknowledging Mr. Churchill’s subsequent telegram of regret at not having been able to break his journey, to allude to “the hope of the realisation of Arab aspirations for unity ” as being bound up with the victory of the United Nations The visit, in mid-September, of Mr. Wendell Willkie, as the personal representative of President Roosevelt, provided a further opportunity for expatiating on the same theme in a speech of welcome. Mr. Willkie did not in his reply touch specifically on Arab problems, but his generalisations regarding the rights of small nations and a reference to the Atlantic Charter were hailed as proofs of his sympathy. He was also the recipient of a memorandum drawn up bv Muhammad-al-Sadr, President of the Senate, and the ex-Prime Ministers Jamil Madfai and Taufiq-al- Suwaidi, which consisted mainly of a criticism of French imperialistic designs in Syria. 9. Subsequently the Prime Minister continued, both in season and out of season, to allude to these topics. At one time in the autumn he was also toying with a grandiose scheme for a pro-democratic bloc under British segis, to include Turkey. Persia, Iraq and the mandated territories of the Levant; this was not publicly mooted and seems, for the time at least, to have been shelved. The Regent s speech from the throne at the opening of Parliament, however, contained an explicit reiteration of hopes for Arab unitv and emancipation. Finally the propaganda campaign initiated in November to prepare public opinion for a declaration of war had. as one of its main themes the idea that Iraq would bv participating, acquire a position enabling her to safeguard and further Arab mteiests as a whole. In contrast to all these high-sounding pronouncements were the actual steps taken during the year to achieve closer co-operation in the Arab world. A modest proposal put forward bv the Bagdad Chamber of Commerce to engage in discussions with other Chambers of Commerce to facilitate inter- territqrial trade and transport and to set up a central bureau for the collection and dissemination of information languished and died in the files of the Ministrv of Economics. In the cultural field, however, some progress was achieved with the formation m Cairo of an Anglo- Iraqi Bureau for Cultural Co-operation, whose fiist task was to draft a cultural treaty between the two countries - this would be open to subsequent adherence by other Arab countries. On the political side attention was in general focussed on the problems of Syria and the Lebanon whose Governments remained unrecognised bv Iraq throughout the Vear’ Palestine was less to the fore, though the reassertion of Zionist claims in connexion with the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Balfour Declaration provoked natural reactions in Iraq as elsewhere in the Arab world The Bagdad press went no further than to reproduce (no doubt with official encouragement) an ’ article from a Transjordan newspaper, in which the Jews were accused of breaking the truce voluntarily observed by the Arabs since the outbreak of war. General Nuri was nevertheless undoubtedly worried by what he regarded as the undue growth of Jewish influence and propaganda/more particular^ in the United States. When m Egypt, at the end of December, he discussed th-fquestion with the Egyptian Prime Minister with a view to a joint approach to the United5 States Government; to King Abdul Aziz ibn Sand he was also suggesting a demarche to His Majesty’s Government to restrain the agitation tor a Jewis Government in Palestine. . „ , T j „ 10. In the concluding paragraph of my review for last year 1 drew attentio 'to the increasing gravity of the economic situation. During 1942 it outweig ec in importance all other problems, though this was only intermittently realised JKy the Iraqi Government themselves. Our military disbursements grew liom ^Snth to month and, in the absence of any measures for absorbing surplus purchasing power, the currency circulation increased from LI). H million to almost I D. 22 million in the year. Simultaneously imports into Iraq were furthei curtailed, with the result that prices continued, to mount at an accelei atmg ia e mot only those of commodities in short supply, but even more markedly ol land and local products. Hoarding and speculation proceeded unabated, thus torcmg prices far higher than purely legitimate demand could have done and causing a phenomenal increase in the cost of living. For the lower classes this was certainly doubled during the year. Real hardship was caused to those m receipt of fixed incomes, but labour, on the other hand (particularly skilled) was able to obtain substantially higher wages, for the demand from the British military (authorities exceeded the available supply. The cultivators, except m the nort . where considerable distress prevailed, benefited from the inflated prices commanded by local produce of every description; landowners, merchants and contractors waxed prosperous as never before. The majority of the population, then, was not seriously affected by the inflationary tendencies, and discontent in regard to prices (as opposed, to shortages and maldistribution) was little in evTdence. Add to this the continued buoyancy of the State revenues, which permitted the grant of two substantial high cost-of-living allowances to Government employees, and it will be seen that there was small incentive for the Iraqi Government to embark on the comprehensive and drastic measures required to remedy the situation. In effect, too, the dinar being linked, to sterling, the British taxpayer was shouldering the main burden by paying for goods^ and services prices out of all relation to world levels, while Iraq was rapidly being transformed from a debtor into a creditor nation. Some endeavours were made, as recorded in the following paragraph, to regulate supply questions and eventually, after many representations on my part, the Government came also to realise that something must be done to deal with the fundamental problem of draining off the surplus purchasing power in the hands of the public. A committee was accordingly appointed and reported to the Minister of Finance in November. Their recommendations covered practically all the ^resolutions of the anti-inflation conference convened by the Minister of State in September and were still under study at the end of the year, the natural reaction of Ministers being to put in the forefront those which entailed assistance from His Majesty s Government (e.cj., the provision of dollars for investment pui poses, increased imports, &amp;c.) and to pass over such uncomfortable suggestions as increased taxation. It may, nevertheless, be hoped that the committee’s labours will not have been entirely in vam, and it may be noted that a pioposal foi an internal loan was under urgent examination by a committee at the end of the year. Apart from official action—or rather inaction some piogiess was made with encouraging the purchase by Iraqi investors of securities on the London Stock Exchange, while arrangements were also put in hand foi the supplv of diamonds to the local market through the U.K.C.C. H l n the field of supply rather more activity was shown, though the results achieved left much to be desired. On the administrative side the old Central Supplies Committee, under the Ministry of Economics, was reorganised m February under the Ministry of Finance by elimination of the non-official members and reduction to eight experienced officials, of whom three were British. This was followed, in March by legislation conferring extensive powers on the Minister of Finance to regulate 'the economic life of the country. The difficulties of organising an efficient Department of Supply and ingrained reluctance to inter fere with vested interests, particularly the landowners, meant, however, that these powers were far from fully employed. The price of wheat had been fixed early in January at prices ranging from about 25 dinars a ton downwards, but before the new harvest the Government encountered insuperable difficulties in buying enough at controlled prices to maintain supplies of flour in the large towns, and His Majesty’s Government had to come to their assistance with substantial imports. After the harvest the levying of the produce tax in kind helped to assure urban supplies, if somewhat precariously, and although the price of wheat on— 6 the black market rose in some areas to unprecedented levels, bread of a kind at »official prices continued to be available. Barley, millet and rice, of which the harvests were excellent, commanded even more exorbitant prices than wheat, partly owing to purchases for export, but largely thanks to hoarding and i speculation. Stocks of sugar held by merchants were taken over by the Govern ment in March and rationing was later introduced on the basis of 1 kg. per head per month at a price of 85 fils, which meant a profit of over 100 per cent, for the Treasury. Motor tyres were similarly taken over and their sale at li prices made subject to licence. Licensing was also introduced in respect of a other imported commodities (constructional steel, &amp;c.) which were not to any extent determining factors of the cost of living. Finally, late in the year the new ! Minister of Finance, Saleh Jabr, who on the whole is less inclined than his 1 predecessors to spare vested interests, ordered the seizure of the three woollen cloth mills in Bagdad and later of a soap factory, with the aim of providing these commodities at a reasonable price to Government employees. In general, however, the Government only scratched the surface of the problem during 1942. and, as I have continually impressed upon them, far more sweeping, vigorous and ruthless action is required. It is unfortunate in the circumstances that executive authority in the Supply Department should not have been entrusted to British officials. With an excellent harvest in prospect, Iraq has more to do than assure the subsistence of her own people; it is essential that she should make available substantial amounts to relieve the needs of neighbouring countries. To this double task the Prime Minister has paid much lip-service. It remains to be seen whether it will be successfully discharged. I have, &amp;c.

In the closing paragraph of his review tor 1940, Sir Basil Newton foreshadowed the relinquishment of office by Rashid Ali, who, in despite of increasing pressure not only from His Majesty’s Government but also from the Regent and from political elements both within and without his own Cabinet, had maintained himself as Prime Minister since Api il. Supported by the army leaders (Colonels Salah-ud-Din Sabbagh, Kamil Shabib, Fahmi Said and Mahmud Salman, alias the “ Golden Square ”) he continued during the month of January to cling to power, while Nuri Said, still in theory a member of the Cabinet, although his resignation was in the hands of the Regent, strove to persuade his colleagues that the ship was sinking, and that they should abandon it Eventually the continued firm attitude of His Majesty’s Government and the obstruction of’public business by the Regent led to the resignation of Naji Shaukat, Minister of Justice (published on the 25th January) and of Naji Suwaidi. Minister of Finance (28th January). General Taha-al-Hashimi’s resignation being also extant, this reduced the number of Ministers below the constitutional minimum of six. Rashid Ali, however, flouted constitutional precedent by refusing to resign and coerced the Regent into signing decrees for the appointment of four new Ministers—Ali Mahmud-al-Sheikh Ali, \unis Sabawi, Musa Shahbandar and Muhammad Ali Mahmud. He must, none the less, have feared the prospect of parliamentary criticism which had been growing increasinglv outspoken, for he also unsuccessfully endeavoured by threats of force to obtain the Regent’s signature to an iradah dissolving the Chamber. At this juncture the Regent prudently disappeared from Bagdad and took refuge with loyal elements of the army at Uiwaniyah, where he also had the support of the tribes. Faced with this Impasse and lacking the full support even of his own Cabinet, Rashid Ali eventually resigned on the 31st January. 3. On the 1st February General Taha, who had followed the Regent by air to Diwaniyah, accepted an invitation to form a Government. The claims of Jamil Madfai and Ali Jaudat, the foci of resistance in Parliament to Rashid Ali, who had proceeded by car, seem to have been outweighed by the Regent’s belief that General Taha could control the army, for whose entry into politics he had been so largely responsible; the chances of Jamil Madfai being able to do so weie certainly slender. In forming his Cabinet General Taha retained two members of Rashid Ali’s team, Umar Nadhmi, who took over the Ministries of Interior and Justice, and Sadiq Bassam, who remained Minister of Education; the new Ministers were Taufiq Suwaidi (Foreign Affairs), Ali Mumtaz (Finance and Com munications), Abdul Mahdi (Economics) and Hamdi-al-Pachachi (Social Affairs), the portfolio of defence being retained by General Taha himself. 4. In some ways the new Government entered upon office under favourable auspices, for the behaviour of Rashid Ali had aroused considerable opposition in circles which, while not necessarily pro-British, had viewed with apprehension the activities of the “ Golden Square ” and behind them of the ex-Mufti. The Prime Minister was well received in Parliament when he made his statement of policy and took the occasion to refute some of the accusations contained in Rashid Ali’s letter of resignation, including that of foreign interference in Iraqi affairs. He was unfortunately not the man to deal with the fundamental F 29 — 25] L J ENCLOSE IN WEEKLY LETTER RECo. POL. DEPt. 1 No. 2 0 , . ?ilVLAY‘942 48011 .

It was, perhaps, his hope that the ineie departure of Rashid Ali would satisfy His Majesty s Government , itiso, e was speedily disabused, and the forthright language held by President Roosevelt s emissary, Colonel Donovan, when he visited Bagdad on the 12th February eanno but have impressed him with the determination of the United States to suppor Great Britain. There were minor improvements, it is true, for example, m tnc&lt;gp tone of the press, but despite my predecessor’s repeated representations General Taha remained resolutely irresolute in regard to any attempt to esta &gt; is i Anglo-Iraqi relations on a satisfactory basis. A weak character and the slave of his past, his personal desires (assuming them to have been on the r !qht l mes ) and the influence of his more energetic Foreign Minister could not decide him to brave the antagonism of Rashid Ali and of that army clique which, having created it as a means to his own ends, he had had the mortification of seeing turn against him. To conciliate Rashid Ali (whom he actually consulted on his state ment of policy), Parliament (where increasingly outspoken criticism was being levelled at Rashid Ali and the army in politics) and His Majesty’s Government (who were no longer disposed to be accommodating) was an impossible feat even for an Iraqi politician. The plain words which you spoke to Taufiq Suwaidi when he flew to see you in Cairo on the 7th March and the Regent’s insistence on action a^inst the “ Golden Square ” seem finally to have determined General Taha to positive action. On the 26th March orders were issued for the transfer of Colonel Kamil o. Shabib from Bagdad to Diwaniyah and for the removal of Colonel Salah-ud-Din Sabbagh’s headquarters from Bagdad to Qaraghan. The officers, supported by their two associates, refused to obey, and General laha w T as unable, or too irresolute, to enforce the order. As a' weak compromise he pressed the Regent to accept an apology from the four officers for their conduct m January, which w r as to be regarded as closing that incident. His Highness’s refusal to do so (though in the absence of support he agreed, when it was already too late) must be held to have precipitated events. On the evening of the 1st April the Golden Square seized, without encountering resistance, military control of Bagdad and forced the Prime Minister to indite his resignation. Their intention to force the Regent to accept this resignation (or eliminate him if he refused, in preparation for which they are said to have been forearmed with a death certificate) and reinstate Rashid Ali was frustrated by a second hegira, this time via the United States Legation and Habbaniya to Basra. Without the Regent there could be no legal change of Government, and the position was thus still fluid when I arrived in Bagdad on the 2nd April to take up mv duties. General Taha was not, however, the man to attempt any opposition to the rebels, who lost no time in consolidating their position. The Regent, indeed, had hoped to be able to reassert himself in Basra, but the army there turned against him. and he had to take refuge in a British gunboat, together with Jamil Madfai and Ali Jaudat; they were later conveyed to Palestine by aeroplane. 6. Although Rashid Ali, with the Mufti at his elbow, had been the protagonist of rapprochement with the Axis Powers and was recognised by the latter as their principal tool in Iraq, it is significant that the army now publicly took the initiative. It was by proclamation over the signature of General Amin Zaki, Chief of the General Staff that a “ Government of National Defence ” was set up and its provisional direction entrusted to Rashid Ali : and the High Defence Council which was constituted consisted of the Chief of the General Staff and two other officers in addition to the 4 ‘ Golden Square, as against only three civilians—Rashid Ali, Yunus Sabawi and Ali Mahmud. In the light of later events it may reasonably be concluded that the rebel Government was the Government of the Golden Square, and not a Government of Rashid Ali relying on the unqualified support of the army. As a politician of practised cunning with a considerable following he was certainly more than a figure-head; as such a politician, indeed, he was indispensable, but at the same time far from all-powerful. The exact shape of Axis plans for utilising Rashid Ali can at present be only a matter of speculation, but the coup d'Etat seems at least to have been precocious. From the first Rashid Ali did his best to play for time. From the first he was scrupulous to present the coup as a purely internal matter, to invest the “election” by a forcibly convened Assembly of a new “Regent” in the person of Sherif Sharaf, a poor relation of the Royal family, with the greatest possible semblance of legality, and to profess to me—at first throughintermediaries and subsequently in person—his ardent wish to implement the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty both in letter and in spirit. \ he Cabinet which he gathered round him consisted of Musa Shahbandar, Nap Shaukat, Nap buwaidi, Ali Mahmud, Rauf Bahrani, Yunus Sahawi, Hassan Salman and Muhammad Ali Mahmud. 7. In retrospect our exchanges in the first two weeks of April seem strangely irrelevant, almost unreal. No doubt Rashid Ali hoped against hope that protestations and promises would once again impose upon the credulous British until German and Italian military support could become effective. His policy suited us well, for it was of great importance that we should have a respite for the maturing of our plans. The landing of a British force at Basra was feared from the first, though the Golden Square seem to have had some confidence in their ability to frustrate this and made their dispositions to do so. No opposition was, however, offered on the 13th April to the arrival, of which onl\ the \ery briefest notice was given, of the cruiser H.M.S. Emerald at Basra. On the same dav I received news of the despatch of British troops to Basra in order to open U p_P)y force if need be—the line of communication to which we had a treaty riMit Secrecy was preserved for so long as possible, and it was not until the evening of the 16th April that I informed Rashid Ali that air-borne troops were due on° the following day and a convoy of sea-borne troops on the 18th. He received the news without apparent perturbation and promptly agreed to afford all facilities, only expressing the hope that in return His Majesty’s Government would be speedy to accord to the new regime the recognition which they had. so far withheld. He carried the army leaders with him. instructions were sent to Basra not to offer resistance, and the arrival of the troops took place without incident. 8. Whatever may have been Rashid Ali’s intentions (and his persistence in seeking recognition argues that for the time being he desired to avert an open breach) the Golden Square was full of confidence. I was informed officially that the disembarkation of further forces would not be permitted until those who had landed had passed through the country. When, on the 28th April, the Ministry for Foreio-n Affairs were notified of the forthcoming arrival of three further ships carrying &amp; men belonging to the formations already landed, this decision was maintained and later confirmed to me by Rashid Ali. His attitude at our meeting was indeed, so menacing that I decided on the immediate evacuation ol British women and children and received from him a promise that they would be allowed to leave the country in safety. The next afternoon they were convened to Habbaniya with the help of ^the Iraqi authorities, but that same ni^fit the movement of considerable Iraqi forces to positions commanding our air base at Habbaniya began and at dawn on the 2nd May the Air Officer Commanding wab compelled to attack. , ^ , • ,i 9. This movement of Iraqi troops also decided me to put into action the pre-arranged plan for the protection of the remaining British subjects m Bagc ac and elsewhere. Accordingly, on the 30th April, all male British subjects and the few remaining ladies 'were concentrated either m the embassy grounds or. thanks to the generous co-operation of the late Mr. 1 aul Knabenshue in the United States Legation : a number of British subjects who had come into town from outlying districts joined us, as did also a few friendly neutrals. Hi Majesty’s Consul at Mosul was simultaneously warned of the situation, and he succeeded in o-athering the greater part of his scattered colony within the Bmited precincts of Bie consulate. Throughout the month of May over 350 British subjects were housed and fed in the embassy over 150 m the Tinted States Legation and about 100 in His Majesty’s Consulate at Mosul. A comparatue \ small number of British subjects in the outlying districts were apprehended and interned either locally or in Bagdad. They met with varying treatment, which in some cases was inexcusably bad and called for representations.^ bo far as e embassy and the legation were concerned, I am happy to say thin, apam mmi a natural anxiety, the •“ internees ” were of good heart and seemed none the worse forthe experience, but at Habbaniyah many of the women and children were subjected to the bombardment of the Iraqi forces tor several days and the aerodrome was being fired upon when they were assembling for evacuation by air to Basra In spite of this, their evacuation was effected without casualties. 10 ' Iraqi resistance was unexpectedly vigorous and, though it cannot be said that the country as a whole rose in arms “ to defend its independence (as Bagdad broadcasts claimed) for the active support given by the tribes was [29—25] B 2—— r - - negligible, feeling in the towns ran high in support of the movement. For una e \, the material assistance which Germany and Italy could supply, being then eaw &gt; engaged in Greece and later in Crete, was very limited, bmall numieis o technical personnel arrived in the country, some few aeroplanes were sen am the Vichy authorities in Syria were induced to despatch some war material. Aner some anxious days the measure of the Iraqi forces on the “ western front wa taken, and our troops, who had advanced from Palestine, were repulsed each time by the broadcast war communiques at shorter and shorter distances trom Bagdad. On the 29th May Rashid Ali, his colleagues, the Golden Square and some few of their most prominent supporters fled from Bagdad and crossed into Iran; the Germans and Italians had previously gone north to Mosul, whence they retired to Svria when the movement collapsed, \unus Sabawi, left behind m Bagdad as military governor to organise the final resistance, found jt P ru( ; eilt - after a few hours of office, to follow the others to Tehran, and on the 30 th May a temporary “ Committee of Internal Security ” sued for an armistice. Fighting ceased on the 31st May, and on the following morning the Regent was ceremonially welcomed back to Bagdad. His Royal Highness, although accompanied by Jamil Madfai, Ali Jaudat, Nuri Said and Baud Haidari did not succeed or forty-eight hours in constituting a Government, during which time the rabble of Bagdad, actively assisted by sections of the army and police, were able to indulge in the favourite Arab pastimes of rapine and pillage; many Jews were murdered or wounded and much commercial property looted before order was restored , • \\ After much persuasion Jamil Madfai was induced to form a Cabinet, to which he appointed Ali Jaudat. Mustafa-al-I mari, Jalal Baban, Ibrahim Kemal, Nasrat-al-Farisi, Ridha Shabibi and Ja’far Hamudi; Nun Said, as a potential embarrassment, was packed off as Minister to Cairo. ie new Administration fell in readily enough with the desiderata of His Majesty s Government, agreeing to the stationing of British troops anywhere in Iraq foi the duration of the war, to the establishment of a censorship, to British military participation in the control of Basra and to the expulsion of the Italian Legation. In this respect their intentions were good and. although difficulties arose from time to time over minor points, they proved co-operative and helpful. Jamil Madfai and his colleagues, however, seemed unable to handle the internal situation with which they were confronted. When they came to power the tri &gt;es, on the whole, were quiet.'and the support of the Kurds, who were stirring htfully, would have been won over by the satisfaction of some of their grievances. ^ e army, discredited with the public, had not recovered from a sound drubnmg. The enemy propaganda machine was disorganised. Rapid and drastic action against known Axis sympathisers and partisans of Rashid Ah could have been carried out without risk of opposition; and such action would have gone far towards convincing the large body of time-servers that it was pruoent _o idea.ify themselves with the democratic cause. In fact, however, the Madfai Ga nne^ acted as though the events of May had been comparable to any of the other cou V s d’Etat by which one Government had succeeded another since the death of King Faisal I—one more lamentable episode over which it was. charitable to draw a decent veil A number of Palestinian and Syrian teachers, long an undesirable element, were indeed dismissed; but Iraqi offenders, whether m the service of the State or not. were so tenderly handled as almost to give the impression that the Cabinet themselves lent belief to Rashid Ali’s promise to be back shortly with a German army. Nor did the Anglo-Soviet advance into Persia (which led to the capture of three members of the Golden Square and some of the rebel Government, though Rashid Ali and the Mufti escaped) seem to hearten them appreciably Inevitably the zeal of the mutessarifs and other responsible officials flagged when Ministers themselves interceded on behalf of the worst offenders; inevitably, too, anti-British propaganda grew in volume and in force even though at the same time our own propaganda was being organised in a vastly increased scale. The publication of notices calling upon Eashid Ali and the other rebel leaders to return for trial and dilatory preparations for the opening of a concentration camp at Fao did little to impress the public with any increase of firmness on the part ot the Administration, though the arrest of three trouble-makers from the Southern Euphrates area, chief among them being Sheikh Abdul Wahid, had a salutary effect in that part of the country. . ' 12 One member of the Cabinet, Ibrahim Kemal, was outspokenly impatient with the vacillations of his colleagues and eventually resigned early in September.5 Jamil Madfai found himself unable to carry on much longer in office, but agreed to do so until the Regent could arrange for a successor. From the British point of view Ibrahim Kemal appeared the most satisfactory candidate, but proved unable to form a Cabinet. Eventually Nuri Said was summoned back from Cairo and on the 9th October constituted his Cabinet, consisting of Salih Jabr (Anting Minister for Foreign Affairs in addition to being the first Shia Minister ot the Interior), Ali Mumtaz. Abdul Mahdi, Sadiq Bassam, iahsin An, Amin Zaki and Jamal Baban : Nuri retaining the portfolio of Defence himself. This was a stronger team than at first seemed likely and, while not entirely composed of harmonious elements and in spite of rumours of dissension, it remained ostensibly united at the close of the year, though Amin Zaki had ceased to attend to public business owing to persistent ill-health. I he Prime Minister, before his appointment, promised me full co-operation and announced his determination to pursue a vigorous policy. ... , i 13. In the implementation of the Anglo-Iraqi Alliance it must be recorded that the present Administration have been exemplary. They have raised no difficulties over acceding to any of the requests of our military authqi ities, though performance, in cases where (as, for example, the requisitioning of land and buildings) legislation is needed, has tended to lag behind promise. The Prime Minister further indicated his desire to see the Iraqi army allotted a definite role in the defence of the country against a German attack, to which His Majesty s Government agreed. In internal affairs, too, he has shown himself more vigorous than his predecessor. A considerable number of the more virulently anti-British officials and others were consigned to the concentration camp at Fao, some being later transferred to a new and less accessible camp at Salman in the desert. The long overdue reform of the Ministry of Education was pushed on with no little energy, and, at the end of the year, negotiations were in progress to obtain the services of Professor Hamle^ to assist m the wqik of reorganisation. More power was put into the hands of some of the British officials^ notably in the police. Finally, Nuri personally took in hand the reform of the army; conscription (always unpopular with the tribes) is being relaxed outside the towns, the eventual aim being that half the other ranks shall be volunteers; the weeding out of undesirable officers is in progress, though it may be Questioned whether anti-British proclivities cive heie the reftl touchstone ruc whether Nuri in certain cases is not primarily concerned with safeguarding his own position At the end of November the trials of Rashid Ali, his Cabinet, the Golden Square and the Chief of General Staff of the time were begun in camera before a military court, but had not been concluded before the end of the year; indications were that the sentences would be satisfactorily severe. It would be’foolish to suggest that in three months of office Nuri Said had succeeded in undoing the harm of years or that he had even seriously interfered with the subterranean spate of Nazi intrigue and propaganda, particularly m the towns, which Jamil Madfai’s supineness had allowed to regather volume m the summer: that there were not still at large many dangerous men from the British point of view because thev were protected by this Minister or that, oi even by the Pi ime Minister himself. Nevertheless, an important start had been made, and it may be anticipated that Nuri Said will continue his efforts. Outside the towns British influence had been strengthened by the work of my political advisory staff, and a very notable improvement in the general atmosphere was achieved over the last six months of the year. . ^ 14. A seriously disturbing feature of the Iraqi scene at the end of 1341 was the economic situation. For nearly two years the impact of war on the economic structure of the country had been of the slightest. 1 he period July to December witnessed a grave deterioration; a bad wheat harvest, restriction of imports in general and 1:he virtual cessation of Japanese imports in particular, the large increase in purchasing power resulting from local expenditure by the British fo'-ces led inevitably to a great rise in the price of almost every commodity, accompanied by wholesale profiteering, speculation and hoarding. Despite growing popular outcry, the Administration appeared incapable of coping with the situation Anti-hoarding legislation of a mild character was indeed promul gated but little use appears to have been made of it; price fixing for a few commodities was decreed, but not effectively enforced after the first week. Efforts to ensure the supplv of bread (the only essential of life m Iraq) at reasonable prices to the poorer classes had not overcome the difficulties by the end of theyear. Steps were, however, taken to control existing stocks of wheat and to obtain supplies from abroad with the help of His Majesty’s Government. No steps weie taken to deal with the fundamental problem of draining oh surplus purchasing power; indeed, it was naively hoped that His Majesty s Government would grant a loan to cover the anticipated budget deficit and thus further increase the volume of purchasing power and accelerate the upward movement of prices. ^*4^ inherent unconcern of Iraqi politicians for the people of the country and the x^ct that many in high places are among the most arrant profiteers and hoarders do not foreshadow the adoption of a sound economic policy, without which British assistance in such matters as the supply of wheat loses much of its practical value, though remaining useful in the field of propaganda. Whether the situation will deteriorate so far as to lead to widespread civil disturbances remains a matter of conjecture, but the outlook in this respect at the end of 1941 was hardly reassuring, though some vicarious comfort might he derived from the fact that popular resentment in this instance was directed mainly against those who were in fact responsible and only fitfully against ourselves. It is. however, to be hoped that the engagement of a British supply expert and other measures of reorganisation will result in effective attention being given to these grave and urgent questions. • I have, &amp;c.

Eden.—(Received February 25.) (No. 23.) 7 7 T t &gt;7 in/ii gj r Bacjdad, January 17, 1941. IN accordance with the instructions contained in Viscount Halifax s circular despatch of the 4th November, 1939, I have the honour to submit the following review of the situation in Iraq during 1940 2 . The cloud of war, which a year ago loomed no larger than a man s hand on the horizon of Mesopotamia, grew with biblical rapidity until by the end of September it had darkened the greater part of the sky. Since then it has receded appreciably, but its presence in larger or smaller shape throughout tne year must be accounted the major determinant of the course of local events. Above all it provided a test of Iraq’s loyalty to her alliance with Great Britain, a test in which she notably failed. , , AT • &amp; -a ^ 3 At the beginning of the year the Government formed by INuri feaid on Christmas Day 1938 was still in office and, despite growing opposition showed no sisrns of disintegration until on the 18th January Rustam Haidar, Minis r of Finance and one of the ablest members of the Cabinet, was shot in his ofhce bv an ex-inspector of police and received wounds of which he subsequently died Two ex-Cabinet Ministers and opponents of Nuri were, among others, arrested on the strength of the murderer’s statements. The Prime Minister was thus exposed to two fires: acquittal of these men would infuriate the Shias (of which sect Rustam Haidar had been), while their conviction would lay him open to a charge of political persecution. On the 18th February he therefore tendered his resignation to the Regent, it being understood that a new Government would be formed by Rashid Ali-al-Gailam, who was then chief private secretary at the Palace and had been Prime Minister from March to October 1933, with Nuri as Minister for Foreign Affairs. These arrangements fell through owing to the opposition of the Chief of the General Staff (General Husain Fauzi) and General Amin-al-Umari, the Officer Commanding the First Division, but when these officers sought to impose their views on the Regent they were relieved of their appointments and placed on pension. I he search for altei native combinations having failed, Nuri returned to office on the 21st February. This stop-gap Government, in which the only change of note was the omission of All Jaudat, previously Minister for Foreign Affairs, lasted a bare five weeks, during which time the Prime Minister’s position became less and less tenable. The Rustam Haidar murder trial, indeed, passed off without overt trouble; the murderer was sentenced to death and the other accused were acquitted of complicity, although one of them, Sabih Najib, was given a year s imprisonment for ‘‘exciting hatred against the Government. But the time was ripe foi a change, as Nuri had lost most of his popularity and following and at the second attempt the formation of a new Cabinet under Rashid Ah was successfully accomplished. resi d on the 2 8 th March, and three days later a new Administration had been formed by the first Prime Minister to enter upon office in a constitutional manner since the death of King Faisal I All members of the outgoing Cabinet, with the exception of Dr. Sami Shaukat, found places in the new—Nuri taking the portfolio of Foreign Affairs-and an important section of the potential Opposition was neutralised by the inclusion of Naii Shaukat and Naji Suwaidi. Rashid Ah, who doubtless realised that his previous record might make him suspect, was profuse with the most emphatic assurances of his intention to collaborate wholeheartedly with His Majesty s [Ifi—20] ItrStc 2X2 Government. His subsequent story has been a sorry one of attempted b ac max over Palestine and Syria, disregard of treaty obligations, eneouragemen o an i British sentiment and intrigue with our enemies. , 5. During 1939 the presence of the cloud of war at so safe a distance exertea but little influence on developments in Iraq. After the initial cloudburst m Poland the gentle drizzle which issued from it over Western Purope mei ‘eiv had occasional value as news and gave rise to hopes that it might hasten t ^ emancipation of Palestine and Syria. With the rapid gathering of the stoim in the spring and summer of 1940 the Iraqi had as rapidly to readjust his ideas. The Allied defeat in Norway, the enslavement of the Low Countries, the sicmificant entry of Italy into the war, the capitulation of France, with its consequences for Britain both at home and in the Meditei i anean, bioug t im face to face with the possibility that the deluge might spread even to this distant desert. Naturally he found the prospect alarming, and the attitude ot the average Iraqi was well expressed by one of the chief and most anti-Butish newspapers, the Istiqlal, when it said : I he policy of the Ai ab nation is dictated by the desire on the one hand to avoid the dangers of war, and on the other to exploit any opportunities presenting themselves.” 6. Since Iraq could not hope to stand alone, Rashid Ah had some excuse in feeling that a policy of reinsurance with the Axis would be prudent in itself and useful as a means of extorting concessions from Great Biitain. Geiman successes and Allied reverses, grave enough and vastly magnified by unceasing propaganda, at one time induced a wide-spread belief in Iraq that Great Britain might well be defeated; it was an easy course for the Prime Minister to maintain his position at home by beating the pan-Arab drum, which, with the ex-Mufti of Jerusalem and his henchmen active in Bagdad, inevitably sounded an anti- British note; enemy agents were also busy and spent freely. Whether any Iraqi politician honestly believed that the country could stand to gain from a victory of the Axis—or even retain a shadow of independence—may be doubted; many, however, despite their rhetorical expressions of love for independence, might be content with the post of a Gauleiter or something similar. At all events Rashid Ali, while continuing to pay occasional lip-service to the British connexion, embarked on a policy fundamentally opposed to British interests. 7. Up to the time of Italy’s entry into the war the Government conducted itself fairly well and, while refusing to give any positive lead to public opinion, Rashid All, in response to my urgent representations, did take steps to check the dissemination of German propaganda and paid some heed to the lessons about internal treachery taught by Norway and the Netherlands. The testing time came on the 11th June, when—probably at the instance of Naji Shaukat—the Cabinet decided to disregard the precedent set by their predecessors in regard to Germany and to postpone the rupture of diplomatic relations with Italy, who had declared war on the Allies the previous day. Despite my strong and repeated representations and the example given by Egypt this decision was maintained and seemed, unhappily, to many Iraqis to have been a wise one. when France collapsed a week after the Italian declaration of war. At the end of the year the Italian Minister, with a considerably reinforced staff, was still in Bagdad. “Absolute neutrality” became the slogan of Rashid Ali’s foreign policy and was assiduously advertised throughout the Government-controlled press, while the good advice regarding the wisdom of firmly supporting Great Britain which Nuri Said received when he visited Angora at the end of June was disregarded. British prestige had reached its lowest ebb, and even Nuri seems to have concluded that Iraq and the Arab nations should consider what steps they could take to safeguard their future irrespective of Great Britain. The position in Syria (where Nuri stopped on his return from Turkey) resulting from the collapse of France now became a major issue, and here, too, Iraqi policy, aiming at “liberation,” came into conflict with that of His Majesty’s Government, who for the time being wished to see the authority of the mandatory Power upheld. This divergence vied with, and almost superseded, the Palestine problem as the alleged obstacle to true Anglo-Iraqi co-operation. It was another opening for the 'second end of policy, namely, “to exploit any opportunities presenting themselves.” With France defeated and Great Britain struggling for her existence, there appeared to have come a golden opportunity for Iraq to intervene as the saviour of downtrodden Palestine and Syria and the champion of the pan-Arab cause. The mission of Colonel Newcombe to establish contact with3 the Palestinian nationalists encouraged hopes that Great Britain was yieldn g, but, of course, in doing so was thought to show a readiness to considei tnen ambitions in an unofficial way. It may, therefore, have helped to tide ovei a critical period for us of particular difficulty and weakness. Many schemes were propounded for Syria, ranging from occupation by the Iraqi army to a polite demarche at Vichy by the Arab Powers calling for the Constitution to be ’“'stored. Many suggestions were brought up for I alestme in discussions w Colonel Newcombe, but none acceptable to His Majesty s Government. The return of Colonel Newcombe to England, followed by the intimation on the 29th August that His Majesty’s Government could not depart from their declared po icy regard to Palestine, and the failure of Nuri Said during an impetuous visit to Transjordan and Egypt in mid-August to obtain any support for joint action in the J matter of Syria, dashed these hopes, engendered bitterness, and drove the pan-Arab and anti-British elements to seek their aims by leikless a subterranean methods. Blackmail having failed, the stage was set for moie SlU ' g How long reinsurance had been under surreptitious negotiation is not clear, though an approach to the Axis Powers was being advised already in July by the Iraqi representative at Vichy. Early in September Naji Shaukat left Istanbul ostensibly for reasons of health, but, in fact, to establish contact with Herr von Papen, the German Ambassador to Turkey. Meanwhile the attitude of the press, censorship of which was in fact, though not in theory, large y controlled by the Ministry of Defence, continued to deteriorate; ant]-British and pro-Axis propaganda increased rapidly throughout the country. An official declaration of the sympathy of the Axis with Arab aspirations, broadcast from Berlin on the 21st October and subsequently repeated from Ban, received wide nublicitv and no criticism of it was permitted for some time to appeal in press On the 28th October Naji Shaukat returned from Turkey, the bearer, it was believed, of German proposals Three days later the telegraphic communication between Iraq and Geimany and , ' / ' t in the press. Whether or not there was any connexion between the nvo events, the latter could only be regarded as a direct provocation to ourselves Atjdm same time irrefutable evidence was reaching London that Rashid Ah hume waTintriguing with the Axis, and stories derived from a variety of sources were circulating that Iraq was about to resume diplomatic relations with Geimanv The Regent’s Speech from the Throne at the opening of Parliament on the 5th November contained only the most perfunctory reference to the Alliance with Great Bntaim ^ ^ November the patience of His Majesty’s Government was exhausted, and it was made plain that unless a new Government could be formed without Rashid Ali British relations with Iraq must continue to deteiioiate untn they reached a crisis. The Regent and Nun Said had for some time been anxious to bring about the elimination of the Prime Minister; important political nersonalities out of office professed the same view; and there was no evidence of any popular support in the country for the Cabinet’s policy—rather the contraiy. Thl P fr^v noliGcal clique led bv Colonel Salah-ud-Din Sabbagh and in which oro NazLnfluenoe wa^strong, were, however, opposed to a change as a resu t of Whidl theii own wings might be clipped, and in the background the ex-Muf i was exercising both directlv and indirectly, the strongest and most undesnable Tfluence Rashid Ali himself offered, indeed, every assurance of his intention of ^continuing to fulfil the Treaty of Alliance (from which he « never to have departed), but it was too late foi any such assurance to pe accent able The fertile brain of Nuri Pasha evolved scheme upon scheme for his elimination buLione progressed beyond its initial stages. An intimation to RaXd Ali’by the Regent that he would be well advised to resign was rejected with a hint from the Minister of Defence, General 1 aha, that such advice was unconstitutional- there were periodical rumours, not wholly unfounded, that tic a ™v were preparing to resist any change of Government; and enquiry was made fn LoX whether 'the represen tations which I had made were upheld by the Secretary of State The attitude of His Majesty’s Government was unequivocal; secretary ox oca . ith t \ :u ,, promises, and the opportune success of Brrtisharms in the Western Desert lent force to their words. They were secmi'lcd British ai ms i d Turkish Governments, who both indicated the importance Chich they attached to the maintenance of good relations by Iraq4 t with Great Britain. Economic pressure was initiated. None the l ess &gt; characteristic delays, hesitations and personal jealousies impeded the fall of Rashid Ali. Although there seemed to be an increasing realisation in political circles that he must go, the end of the year saw him still obstinately, if desperately, clinging to office. . . . 10.

CONFIDENTIAL. 1 235 Februijry 5, 1940. 1940 J 7 Section 1. y (15819) [E 500/500/93] Copy No. 0( Sir B. Newton to Viscount Halifax.—{Received February 5.) (No. 31.) My Lord, Bagdad, January 20, 1940. IN accordance with your circular of the 4th November last, I have the honour to submit the following review of the general attitude of Iraq during 1939 :— 2. It has been an eventful year. It has seen the Palestine Conference, the death of Iraq’s second King, and the outbreak of war between Britain and Germany. The Government of Nuri Said, while passing through some difficult moments, has kept steadily on its course, exceeding the average duration of Iraqi Administrations without having had to broaden its basis or, indeed, make any changes in its structure except minor ones dictated by local considerations. The end of the year found it, while its chief was not over-happy and its members not over-united, yet maintaining its hold over the destinies of the State in the absence of any other political combination capable of taking its place. 3. The first event of the year was the Palestine Conference, at which Iraq was represented by the President of the Council, his place being taken later by Taufiq Suwaidi, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs. The course of the conference is too well known to need description here. Suffice it to say that, agreement between the delegations to the conference proving impracticable, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom were obliged to announce their own policy, which they did in the white paper of May. The Iraqi Government, in company with the Governments of Egypt and Saudi Arabia, adopted the attitude that they could not recommend the Palestine Arabs to accept the proposals in the white paper, and they have never, in effect, departed from this non possumus attitude. So far as Iraq is concerned, it would be misleading to say that the Government base their objections on one aspect of the white paper more than on another, since there is no guarantee that, assuming that satisfaction were given to them on certain points to which they have drawn attention, they would not find further pretexts for complaint. In so far as their attitude is definable at all, it is that they dislike the whole principle of Jewish settlement in Palestine; that they do not believe that His Majesty's Government can, or will, carry out in practice the terms of the white paper; and that they are convinced that, as matters at present stand, the Jews will find means of asserting their preponderance in Palestine. There are, of course, various shades of opinion in Iraq as regards Palestine, and the Government, though pan-Arab, do not represent the extreme pan-Arab element; but they have to take account not only of the use of Palestine as a political counter* by the Opposition, but of the activities and influence of the various members of the Arab Higher Committee and the other Palestinian refugees who have sought sanctuary in Iraq. The arrival of the Mufti of Jerusalem in Bagdad on the 16th October from Syria naturally complicated the problem, since, although the Government’s assurance to me that he would not be allowed to indulge in political activities seems, in the main, to have been kept, his presence in Iraq has furnished the occasion for numerous pan-Arab gatherings and demonstrations, and has stimulated interest in the Palestine question. This question is, in fact, the only serious respect in which the interests of the two States allied by the treaty of 1930 still publicly diverge. 4. The second fateful event for Iraq was the death in a motor accident, on . the 4th April, of His Majesty King Ghazi I. While this tragedy, with which the crown passed to a small boy of 4, was a great test for the young Kingdom of Iraq, and even now renders thie future somewhat uncertain, it cannot be denied [2-82] w *2 that it removed a ruler who was not calculated to lead the country to great heights. King Ghazi was not anti-British; indeed, he co-operated on the whole well with His Majesty's Government and their representatives, although only a few months before his death his vanity led him into espousing, on his private wireless, the “ cause of certain “ Liberal Arab elements in Koweit who were being “ground down ' by a reactionary sheikh behind whom, of course, stood His Majesty’s Government. But he had neither the application nor the stability of character to make him a fitting ruler of so politically-minded a people as the Arabs of Iraq. Happily, the appointment as Regent of his cousin, the Emir Abdul Illah, a more serious member of the Hashimite family, who already shows signs of political capacity, has encouraged the hope that Iraq will traverse the minority of King Faisal II without injury, and perhaps even with profit. 5. The death of King Ghazi was in one respect remarkable, in that it provided a telling illustration of the widespread and unscrupulous nature of German propaganda in Iraq. As relations between Britain and Germany deteriorated, so did German propaganda in the Middle East in general, and in Iraq in particular, become more active. The German Minister in Bagdad, with the assistance of money, a host of agents and broadcasts in Arabic on the German wireless, worked unceasingly to spread pro-German, if not pro-Nazi, ideas among public opinion in Iraq, particularly the army, the students and the tribes, and naturally did not fail to make use of the Palestine question in his efforts to blacken the British name in this country. The Koweiti controversy also came as grist to the German mill, and when, at the height of it, King Ghazi met with his fatal accident, the opportunity which this combination of circumstances offered to the German propagandists was too good to be missed. Within twelve hours of the tragedy rumours were in circulation that the British were responsible for the King’s death (Dr. Grobba, indeed, later openly hinted at ways in which they might have caused it) and a fanatical mob had surged into the British Consulate at Mosul and murdered His Majesty’s Consul. 6. The Mosul tragedy was a shock to Iraqi opinion. It showed to what extent that opinion had been misled by propaganda and rumour, and it also showed the Government how far public security in Iraq had in consequence deteriorated. General Nuri lost little time in removing from office the Minister of the Interior, Naji Shaukat, who was fanatically nationalist and had refused to take effective steps to prevent the agitation and demonstrations to which the combination of Palestine and German propaganda was constantly giving rise. The Germans, however, did not abate their efforts and, indeed, became increasingly active as the date of the outbreak of wai* between Britain and Germany approached. 7. The events of the 3rd September, 1939, provided the acid test of the Iraqi attitude towards the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Allumce of 1930, article 4 of which was now for the first time invoked. On the whole, while the Iraqi Government’s attitude might have been better, it might also have been considerably worse. They announced their intention of fulfilling the letter and spirit of the treaty. Influenced by the example of Egypt, they did not (as indeed they were not bound to do) declare war or a state of war with Germany. Public expression to Iraqi sympathies was, however, given by a telegram addressed to The King by the Prince Regent, and the Iraqi Government did at once take all the measures (such as breaking off diplomatic and trade relations with Germany, interning German nationals and guarding the essential lines of communication) which they were obliged to take if they were to fulfil the obligations of the treaty. Some members of the Government had clearly not been prepared to go so far as others, and, in particular, the Minister of Defence was concerned to circumscribe, so far as possible. Iraq's obligations to the United Kingdom, not only for political reasons such as Palestine, but also because of Iraq’s relative unpreparedness, the younger officers’ inexperience and fear of war, and the consequent disinclination of the army to take any step which might be calculated to involve Iraqis in the fighting. 8. If. however, there has been cause for disappointment with Iraq’s initial attitude with regard to her treaty obligations, the same cannot be said of the attitude towards the war of Iraqi public opinion in general. Important factors were the suppression of all German news and the ready help given by the Iraqi Press Department to the publicity work of the embassy. The German attack on Poland produced a revulsion of feeling against Germany, and it was at last clearI 3 to all Iraqis that Hitler, so far from standing for the emancipation of small and weak nations from “imperialism,” was simply concerned to rivet upon them the yoke of the swastika. While not losing sight of their former conception or the Arabs chafing under the “ tutelage ” of the great Western democracies, the Iraqis have recognised quite clearly the definite menace of Hitlerism and are anxious to see it defeated, although they hope that Britain and I ranee may find it expedient, during or as a result of the war, to accord full independence and self-determination to the Arabs of Palestine and Syria. 1 he Russian onslaught upon Finland has likewise produced a healthy reaction here, although it has perhaps given a fillip to some of General Null’s not altogether well-considered schemes for reinforcing the security of Iraq and her neighbours by attempts to strengthen the Saadabad Pact or to conclude new pacts.

ONE of the minor inconveniences attaching to the position of His Majesty’s representative in Bagdad lies in the circumstance that half the Bagdad police force salute his passage (for “Auld Lang Syne! ” and the days of the High Commission) while the other half do not. A drive through the streets is thus a long drawn-out dilemma between the risk of failing to acknowledge a courtesy and the loss of “ face ” attendant upon the premature return of a gesture which may not in fact be made. 2. The Iraqi attitude towards the British connexion is not dissimilar, either in proportion or in quality. About half those Iraqis who count accept the British alliance: the other half remain suspicious of it. Few of the former are wildly enthusiastic : few of the latter actively hostile. 3. But in recent years, more particularly in recent months, the shadow of Palestine has tended to falsify these estimates and obscure these divisions. Every Arab Iraqi has some measure of sympathy with the Arabs in Palestine: *[18698] b 2 3 few, indeed, are those whose horizon is wide enough to let them see the danger, even on a difference which arouses national and racial pride, of sniping an ally on whom the continued existence of Iraq as a sovereign State depends. 4. This is perhaps intelligible, though hardly excusable, if one remembers that most of the influential men in Iraq were “out' against Britain in 1920, and retain to this day a regrettably tenacious conviction that the independence of the country was won in that year and not by subsequent process of mandate, treaty and emancipation. 5. It is, then, a matter for some satisfaction that, when the crisis of last September came, the hard realities made themselves felt, and the Government of Iraq stood firm by the alliance. It is true that they were not asked to go very far, and that the crisis—dimly and belatedly realised in Iraq—was not sufficiently protracted to test the temper of the people. But the first steps, at least, towards the implementation of the alliance were promptly and firmly taken. Help was rendered, or promised, towards the securing of imperial communica tions. And the German Minister was given to understand, in no uncertain terms, that, should war break out, he and his colony would be evacuated. 6. Internally, the year has been notable chiefly for the fact that the Govern ment remained unchanged until the very end of the year—in itself a healthy departure from Iraq’s practice of short-lived Cabinets. The Administration, headed by Jamil-al-Madfai, passed through some anxious moments, and for the greater part of the year it was true to say that it owed its continued existence to the circumstance that the parties, or leaders, on either side of it —Nuri and Hikmat Sulaiman—disliked each other much more than they disliked the Prime Minister. But towards the end of the year the Government seemed to have driven its roots into soil somewhat deeper than mere tolerance by others. It seemed, indeed, to have acquired as firm a hold on the country as is possible for any Government so long as the alliance with Britain is overshadowed by Palestine, and so long as it cannot count on any degree of consistent or effective support from the King. It contained three men who are much superior, either in ability or in character, to the Iraqi average. Jamil-al-Madfai is honest of purpose and has been unswerving in his pursuit of internal appeasement: Taufiq- as-Suwaidi is something of a statesman, despite the obviousness of his personal ambitions over Palestine: Ibrahim Kemal, the Finance Minister, is personally incorruptible, has big ideas and has pushed the programme of public works to the limit of financial solvency; were his tact equal to his ability he would be the “coming man.' 7. These three men were making their impression on the country, and it is therefore a matter for regret, as well as for surprise, that a military movement based on relatively trivial grievances, but fortunately bloodless, should, on Christmas Eve, have brought about the fall of the Government and its replace ment by a Cabinet formed by Nuri Said. 8. It is too early to say what dangers to the country may lurk in the renewed incursion of the Iraqi army into the political field—an incursion, as I feel, some what wantonly provoked by Taha-al-Hashimi in the interests of Nuri, himself a statesman whom I have always considered, and still consider, to have lost much of his prestige and something of his judgment in recent years. But, up to the coup cTEtat of Christmas Eve, the chief danger to the continued internal tran quillity and the economic progress of Iraq had seemed to lie in the discontent of the tribes. This discontent arises from a variety of causes : alarm at the progressive establishment of the Central Government’s administrative authority over the country; the inveterate contempt of the Bedu for the town-dweller; a general feeling that not enough is done for the tribes, and that such efforts as are made on their behalf are misdirected (a leading sheikh has complained to me that the one aim of the Government engineers is to bore a well, irrespective of whether or not it lies within grazing territory). 9. However well- or ill-founded the discontent may be, it is in the immediate future to the reconciliation of the tribes that the attention of the Iraqi Govern ment may, in my opinion and so far as their British advisers can direct them, most profitably be turned.4 ■'fa HI 10. With Nuri Said at the helm, the relation between Government and palace must also become a matter of acute concern. II.— Internal Affairs. The Royal Family. 11. In March their Majesties The King and Queen sent a fitted dressing case to King Ghazi as a token of friendship and esteem and in return for the replica of the Golden Harp of Ur which King Ghazi presented to Her Majesty the Queen at the time of their Majesties’ Coronation. 12. King Ghazi remained in Bagdad throughout the year. 13. In June a negro youth employed as personal servant to His Majesty was found shot in the palace precincts. His death was due to the accidental discharge of a revolver which fell to the ground from his hip-pocket as he was lying down. The facts were, however, little believed outside the palace, and the incident gave rise to many stories damaging to the personal reputation of King Ghazi. 14. In April a law concerning the Royal Family was passed by Parliament. It superseded the Royal Family Ordinance of June 1936, but repeated its main provisions with a few unimportant amendments. The main purpose of the law is to set up a council composed of the King, the Prime Minister, the President of the Senate and Chamber, and the Ministers of the Interior and Justice to deal with matters of personal status connected with members of the Royal Family. The Cabinet and Parliament. 15. At the beginning of the year there was some uneasiness about the intentions of Nuri Pasha, but his departure in January put an end to the persistent stories which had been in circulation since his return in December 1937, that he was engaged in intrigues to overthrow the Government, and the Cabinet were then able to settle down to their parliamentary work. 16. The first debate of importance occurred early in February during the second and third readings of a Bill to indemnify all those who had taken part in the events which followed the murder of Bekr Sidqi in August 1937. Most of the speakers strongly condemned the intervention of the army in politics, and many spoke harshly of Flikmat Sulaiman’s Administration. The Prime Minister used the opportunity to reaffirm his Government’s policy of appeasement and their determination to keep the army out of politics. 17. The next event to arouse public interest was the debate on the ratifica tion of the Iraqi-Iranian Frontier Treaty signed in Tehran on the 4th July, 1937. For reasons which it has never been possible wholly to explain, this treaty has aroused wide dislike. The main cause of its unpopularity was probably a general misunderstanding of its provisions. Few people read it (though its text was published in the press), but it was commonly supposed that it gave away the Shatt-el-Arab to Iran. Popular feeling was expressed mainly through strikes and demonstrations of students and an uneasy agitation among officers in the army. The Government dealt with the situation with more than customary firmness, and the Bill for the ratification of the treaty was passed by the Chamber on the 7th March by 81 votes to 10. This success enhanced the prestige of the Ministers, who thereafter continued their work with greater confidence. 18. Another debate of political significance occurred when a Bill to indemnify^ those who had taken part in the events which followed the murder of Bekr Sidqi in August 1937 came before the Senate. On this occasion Rashid Ali-al-Gilani attacked Hikmat Sulaiman’s Government, and with much sanctimoniousness deplored the methods which they had adopted to overthrow Yasin-al-Hashimi and his colleagues. The Prime Minister (who had himself been turned out of office by a tribal insurrection engineered by Rashid Ali and Yasin) thereupon rounded on Rashid Ali and upbraided him with unparliamentary frankness for his own political past. This wordy quarrel in the Senate was taken up gleefully in the newspapers, and for a short time their columns were filled with the mutual recriminations of the rival partisans. So outspoken were some of the attacks made on the work of Yasin’s last Cabinet that the surviving5 members thereof felt obliged to take action to defend their reputation. They accordingly submitted a joint petition asking that Parliament should order a judicial enquiry into the charges which were being made against them. 19. When this petition was discussed there was a good deal of public washing of dirty linen, and Rashid Ali was the particular target of some of the tribal Deputies’ sallies. The Prime Minister, however, true to his principles, appealed to the Chamber to bury the past and the majority of the Deputies were clearly in favour of this course. The result was that the petition was passed to the Legal Committee, which ruled that it was not within the competence of the Chamber to act in the manner requested by the petitioners, and the matter was thereupon dropped. 20. The session should normally have ended on the 23rd April, but it was prolonged by Royal iradah for a further period of fourteen days and not prorogued until the 7th May. The standard of the debates was above the average; this was the result of the Prime Minister’s wisdom in including a number of able men among his official candidates at the election of December 1937. The work of the committees was efficient, and there was a noticeable increase in the sense of responsibility shown in the speeches of the members of both Houses. 21. In all, over sixty laws were passed, the more important of which are summarised below:— The law amending the Land Settlement Law No. 50 of 1932 : to restrict the grant of Lazma right to Iraqi subjects and to control the acquisition of title of this kind by pump-owners. The law for the prevention of harmful propaganda (Ordinance No. 44 of 1937). The law for the indemnification of those who took part in the National Movement of the 11th August, 1937 : to indemnify those who defied the authority of the Government after the murder of Bekr Sidqi. The Royal Family Law : to set up a council to control the affairs of the Iraqi Royal Family. The law for the ratification of the Frontier Treaty between Iraq and Iran, signed at Tehran on the 4th July, 1937. The Metropolitan Passengers Transport Board Law: to create a body to control urban and suburban passenger transport in Bagdad. The Budget Law for 1938-39. The law amending the National Defence Law : to prolong the period of liability to service from 10 to 20 years and to raise the cost of exemption from full colour service-from I.D. 30 to I.D. 50. The Five Years Capital Works Law. The Railway Capital Works Law. The Radio Tax Law; to impose a tax of half a dinar on all private wireless receiving sets. The law for the control of banking institutions. The Residence Law : to repeal the law of 1923 and substitute stricter control of foreigners living in Iraq. The law for the collection of Istihlcik tax on animals and animal products : to abolish the Koda tax and substitute a tax at the place of consumption. 1 Changes in the Madfai Cabinet. a P' Ja - lal Baban ’ the Minister of Economics, resigned on the 15th May. He had become involved in a dispute with the Minister of Finance concerning certain payments to a contractor, and when the matter came before the Cabinet the ruling of the Minister of Finance was upheld. Jalal Baban thereupon resigned. His personal relationship to the contractor lent credence to circumstantial stories that his support of the contractor’s claims was not disinterested. 23. Further Cabinet changes were made on the 29th October. Mustafa-al- Umari was transferred from the Ministry of the Interior to the Ministry of Justice and Abbas Mahdi from the Ministry of Justice to the Ministry of [18698] r&gt; q •Economics and Communications. The Prime Minister gave up the Ministiy o Defence to Sabih Najib (the Director-General of the Ministry for Foreign Allan s) and took over instead the portfolio of the Ministry of the Interior. 24. During the year Mustafa-al-Pmari had become increasingly unpopular as Minister of the Interior. He was undoubtedly efficient, but he had acquired a bad reputation for taking bribes, though nothing had been proved against him. The Prime Minister therefore thought it well to transfer him to another ministry before Parliament met. Sabih Najib was a competent Director-General of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, but his service in the army as a comparatively junior officer was too fresh in the memories of many senior officers for his appointment to a position of authority over them to be welcome. The New Session. 25. King Ghazi opened the autumn session of Parliament as usual on the 1st November. In the Chamber Maulad Mukhlis was re-elected President, and in the Senate Saiyid Muhammad-al-Sadr once more returned to the chair. 25a. Early in November a debate of importance took place in the Chamber on the second and third readings of the convention concluded between the Govern ment and the Iraq Petroleum Company for the exploitation of the oil in the Basra Vilayet. Several good debaters, including Rustam Haidar, Taha-al- Hashimi and Sadiq-al-Bassam, criticised its terms severely, but the Government’s majority stood firm and the convention was approved by 67 votes to 8. 26. On the 30th November a Royal iradah was issued adjourning Parlia ment for a month. The Prime Minister stated in the Senate that the Government had recommended King Ghazi to do this as there was no further legislation ready to submit to Parliament. 27. Apart from the oil convention already mentioned, the only enactment of importance passed by Parliament was a law restoring to Sheikh Mahmud, the Kurdish leader, the properties confiscated from him in 1931. The Fall of the Madfai Government. 28. Towards the end of November and during the first fortnight of December a number of bomb-throwing incidents occurred in Bagdad. The result of the police investigations satisfied the Cabinet that these were organised by dissatisfied political elements with the intention of embarrassing and discrediting the Government. Accordingly, on the 15th December, using their powers under the Harmful Propaganda Law of 1938, the Cabinet banished the following six men from Bagdad : Shaki-al-Wadi, Ismael Ibrahim Hakari, Ali Ghalib, Ali Mahmud, Daud-al-Saadi and Jamil Abdul Wahhab. The first three are officers who had been closely associated with Bekr Sidqi, the last three are lawyers who have for long been active in politics, while Ali Mahmud was Minister for Justice in Hikmat Sulaiman’s Cabinet. A little later, on the 21st December, Rashid Ali-al-Gilani was banished to Ana. As he is a former Prime Minister and one of Iraq’s leading public men, his banishment created a sensation. At the same time two more turbulent lawyers were also sent to cool their heads in the remoter parts of the country. 29. On the 20th December Nuri Said returned from Egypt, and political events then began to move quickly. On the evening of the 24th December a strong detachment of armoured cars and cavalry was moved from the military cantonment on the right bank of the Tigris at Washash and concentrated at Hmaidi, where it came under the direct control of the Chief of the General Staff. Shortly afterwards small parties of these troops were sent to the houses of Nuri Said and Taha-al-Hashimi to protect them, and at the same time a deputation of officers, headed by the Chief of the General Staff, sought and obtained an audience with King Ghazi, to whom they represented the dissatisfac tion of the army with Jamil Madfai’s Administration. They begged His Majesty to call upon the Cabinet to resign and to replace it by another which should 1 i lc i ude , S 611 , who 1 !. ad fayhfuUy served his father, such as Nuri Said and Taha-al-Hashimi. King Ghazi thereupon sent for the Prime Minister and his principal colleagues, who (it is said) found on their arrival that His Maiestv was himself m no condition to discuss the situation. In any case, they were taken7 [18698] B 4 completely by surprise and resigned. His Majesty thereupon summoned Nuri Said and asked him to form a Government. Nuri accepted the task, and at 2 o’clock the following afternoon (the 25th December) a Royal iradah appointing the following Cabinet was read out with the customary ceremony in the Serai :— Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs : Nuri Said. Minister for Finance : Rustam Haidar. Minister for Defence : Taha-al-Hashimi. Minister for Justice: Mahmud Subhi Daftari. Minister for Education : Salih Jabr. Minister for Economics and Communications : Umar Nazmi. Three days later Naji Shaukat, then Iraqi Minister at Angora, was appointed Minister for the Interior. 30. The new Government cancelled the banishment orders issued by their predecessors and adjourned Parliament for another month with effect from the 1st January, 1939. 31. The immediate reasons for this military revolt were seemingly trivial, but its root causes lay deep in the graver events of recent history. Superficially, it was the result of the irritation caused to the Chief of the General Staff by the tactless and over-forceful behaviour of the Minister of Defence, Sabih Najib, whose service in the army as a junior officer was too recent for such behaviour to be acceptable. Fundamentally, however, it was the breaking into flame of the smouldering resentment of the officers who had been displaced and humiliated by those who had won preferment and influence as the friends of Bekr Sidqi. Of these, Taha-al-Hashimi, the Chief of the General Staff whom Bekr had deposed and whose brother Yasin he had driven from office, was the natural leader, and it is to him that the chief part in the movement must be attributed. Nuri Said’s share was probably much the same as Hikmat Sulaiman’s in the military revolt led by Bekr Sidqi; but it is doubtful whether any of the other members of the new Cabinet were in the plot. They were gathered together later, just as Hikmat Sulaiman gathered his colleagues after Yasin-al-Hashimi’s Cabinet had been driven out by the army in October 1936. 32. Judging from their past record, the new Ministers form as competent and reasonable a Cabinet as can be expected in this country, but the manner in which they came into office is disquieting. For the third time in succession the army has set up a new Government, and this unconstitutional method of bringing about changes of administration now seems to be well established. I have done my best to heighten the sense of guilt which I find most of the new Ministers entertain regarding the method of their entering into office, and I have in particular spoken frankly both to Nuri and to the King about the dangers and discredit which these methods bring upon the country. 33. Nuri Said’s Cabinet had made no statement of policy before the end of the year. Indeed, it is unlikely that when they came into office they had any common purpose or political principles. The general administrative policy of the new Ministers is not likely to differ widely from that of their predecessors, but there is one important constitutional question concerning which the course followed by the Prime Minister will need to be watched. It is doubtful whether he has ever forgiven King Ghazi for what he regards as His Majesty’s base and cowardly abandonment of a loyal and faithful servant when Bekr Sidqi marched on Bagdad, and in his talks with many people, during his exile, he spoke much of His Majesty’s shortcomings as a ruler and the need for his replacement by a stronger and abler monarch. It is in consequence not unlikely that he may seek in some way to give effect to these ideas. The Assyrians. 34. In January the Iraqi Government were informed by the Italian Legation that the Italian Government had not approved of or accepted the scheme for settling Assyrians in Abyssinia which Signor Pastori had put forward in the previous June. The Iraqi Government 'thereupon refused permission to Signor Pastori to canvass his scheme among the Assyrians and the matter was dropped.1 B 8 35. In March Mr. C. H. Ditchburn, a British official in the Ministry of the Interior, was sent on special duty on a second visit to the Mosul and Arbil provinces to report on the economic conditions of the Assyrians. He was instructed to give particular attention to :— (a) The transfer of the Lower Tiyari groups from the unhealthy villages of the Nahlah district to the villages left vacant by other groups which had gone to the Khabur. (b) The application to the Assyrians, equally with all other Iraqis, of the policy of land settlement, i.e., to give them title to the Government lands in their possession. 36. The report was finished in May. It showed that there were twenty-six unoccupied Government-owned villages vacated by those who had gone to the Khabur. As regards ownership, it showed that there were fifty Government villages in which the Assyrian inhabitants could expect, under land settlement, to obtain title to their lands, and forty-nine in which they were the tenants of private non-Assyrian landlords. The report revealed that the economic situation of the Assyrians remaining in Iraq was good, and that many of their villages could be classed as prosperous. 37. When offered the choice of transferring to the empty villages, the Assyrians in the Nahlah elected to remain, preferring their rich but unhealthy rice lands to less remunerative but more salubrious lands elsewhere. The empty villages were therefore given to the nomadic Ashuti tribe who number in all about 500 families. 38. Mr. Ditchburn’s report was communicated to the League of Nations in September, but it was not discussed at the autumn session of the Council. 39. In September 1937 the Council of the League of Nations approved of (a) a scheme for reorganising the Khabur settlement on a self-supporting basis costing approximately £50,000; and (b) continued administrative expenditure for the settlement at the rate of £14,000 for the ensuing year (i.e., the calendar year 1938). The Iraqi Government undertook to contribute towards this expendi ture on the same basis as that which they had accepted for the Ghali scheme, i.e., five-twelths of the whole. Before the end of the financial year 1937-38 they made a payment of £10,000 on account, and in the Iraqi budget for 1938-39 a further £17,000 was provided. Of this sum £5,500 was paid to the Assyrian Committee of the Council in October, and a second payment of £4,000 was promised early in 1939. 40. The 1939 budget for the administrative expenses of the Khabur settle ment was drawn up in Geneva in October 1938 for a total expenditure of £6,977, and at the same time it was decided that the Trustee Board should, if possible', bo dissolved during the year and all administrative expenditure brought to an end. If this does not prove to be possible, it is hoped that the committee will be able to meet further expenditure on administration out of savings in the reorganisation budget. It should not, therefore, be necessary to ask the Iraqi Government to allot any further money either for administration or for the reorganisation scheme. 41. In March the Archbishop of Canterbury informed the Foreign Office that Mar Shimun wished to arrange a meeting in Cyprus with Mar Yusuf (who is in Iraq) and Mar Timotheus (who is in Malabar) to discuss questions of Church organisation. He asked if the Iraqi Government would object to Mar Yusuf’s attending such a meeting. I was consulted and advised that a meeting of Mar Yusuf with Mar Shimun would probably react unfavourably on the attitude of the Iraqi Government towards the Assyrians remaining in Iraq and would tend to unsettle the Assyrians themselves. The Foreign Office accordingly warned the archbishop that a meeting between Mar Yusuf and Mar Shimun would not be likely to further the true interests of the Assyrians in Iraq. Nevertheless, in June the archbishop personally interviewed the Iraqi Minister in London and asked for permission to be given to Mar Yusuf to establish contact with the various Assyrian elements in Iraq and then to proceed to Cyprus to meet Mar Shimun. The request was referred to the Iraqi Govern ment, who received it badly and turned it down. H9 42. The conscription of Assyrians began towards the end of the year, and fortunately they seem to have answered the call to the colours without protest. The Kurds. 43. The Kurdish districts remained quiet throughout the year and there were no signs of any further development of national sentiment. 44. A normal administrative organisation was established in the Pizhder tribal areas in August. This area, which lies on the Persian frontier between Sulaimani and Ruwanduz, had remained unadministered since the British officials were withdrawn in 1920. 45. In November a law was passed through Parliament providing for the restoration to Sheikh Mahmud of the estates which had been confiscated from him in 1931. The Euphrates Tribes. 46. After several months’ forced detention in Bagdad permission was given in February to the Euphrates sheikhs, who had been imprisoned by Hikmat Sulaiman in July 1937, to return to their homes. Before leaving they took solemn oaths never again to take part in any movement against the Government. To judge from experience, such pledges are of little value, but the Government evidently hoped that the sheikhs were chastised enough to make it preferable, on the whole, to take the risk of allowing them to go back to their tribes rather than to face the constant agitation for their release which would have attended n prolongation of their detention in Bagdad. 47. For a while they remained quiet, but by the autumn Abdul Wahid was once more beginning to become the centre of tribal agitation and unrest. Tribal Disturbances. 48. Early in May fighting occurred between the Azairij and the Bazzun tribes of the Amara Province. The trouble had its origin in an ancient dispute over land. The casualties, though never accurately established, seem to have been unusually high for tribal fighting and cannot be put at less than three figures. After the fight the Bazzun sheikhs submitted and came into the Government head quarters at Amara. Tribal arbitrators were later appointed from the Muntafiq, and the affair was settled under the Tribal Disputes Regulations. It cannot, however, be said that the quarrel has been ended, for the disputed land remains in the hands of the Azairij i. Murder of an A merican Missionary. 49. The Rev. R. C. Cumberland, an American missionary who had been working in Dohuk in the Mosul Province for some ten years, was murdered in his house by a Doski tribesman on the 12th June. The Royal Air Force sent up an aeroplane a few hours later and removed Mr. Cumberland to Mosul Hospital, but he had been shot three times and was too severely wounded for medical treatment to be of any avail. Circumstantial evidence suggested that the crime was arranged by the relatives of a local schoolmaster who had been converted by Mr. Cumberland. 50. The Iraqi Government expressed their regrets to the United States Legation and undertook to take all possible steps to bring the murderer to justice. Nevertheless, though there is little doubt of his identity, no arrest had been made before the end of the year. Labour. 51. The Bagdad Light and Power Company lost the case which was brought against them in January in the Bagdad Peace Court for the payment of holiday wages under the Labour Law of 1936 (see paragraph 61 of last year’s report). The company took the case to the Court of Appeal, where the peace judge’s award was upheld. The company thereupon paid holiday wages to their workmen, with retrospective effect to the date of the coming into force of the Labour Law. Messrs. Humphreys (Limited) (the contractors building the Royal Air Force air base at Habbaniya) were, however, dissatisfied with the judgment of the court of [18698] c*— 10 cassation and sought to defend a second test case early in April. Before the case had been heard their workmen struck, and the company then decided to abandon further resistance to the official interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Labour Law and to accept the men’s demands for holiday pay. The company were also obliged to concede pay for the first five days of the strike before the men would return to work. 52. No new labour legislation was enacted during the year and there were no other labour troubles of importance. A rchceology. 53. The contract of Dr. Jordan, the German archaeologist who had held the post of technical expert in the Department of Antiquities since the spring of 1931, ended on the 15th November and was not renewed. Two successors were appointed, Mr. Seton Lloyd, an Englishman, and Herr B. Opitz, a German, but neither had arrived before the end of the year. The Iraqi Government made these appointments without reference to His Majesty’s Government. 54. Only one archaeological expedition, that of the Deutsche Forschungs- Gememschaft working at Marka-Uruk, was operating in Iraq at the beginnintr of the autumn season of 1938. 55. In the spring, and again in the autumn, Sir Aurel Stein carried out a detailed investigation of the Roman lines in the Northern Jazirah in the vicinity of the Syrian and Iraqi frontiers. I he Air Officer Commanding gave him much help in this work by providing aircraft for rapid aerial surveys of large areas of country (see paragraph 274 below). 56. Iiaqi Department of Antiquities were themselves excavating at Samarra, Wasit and Khorsabad. Distinguished Visitors. 57. Lord De La Warr spent the night of the 27th-28th February in Bagdad when passing through Iraq on his way from Singapore to London.* 58. Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir Edward L. Ellington stayed in Iraq from the 21st to the 26th February when returning to the United Kino-dom from a tour of inspection in India. 59. Her Royal Highness Princess Alice and the Earl of Athlone, accom panied by Lord Frederick Cambridge, spent the night of the 20th-21st March at the Royal Air Force air base at Habbaniya. They were flying from Bahrein to Egypt after their visit to Saudi Arabia. Their stay in Iraq was private. 60. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, the chief of the Political Bureau of King Abdul Aziz, paid a private visit to Bagdad in April, and Fuad Hamza, the Saudi Arabian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, remained in Bagdad for a few days in November while passing through on his way from the Lebanon to Riyadh. 61. Captain H. H. Balfour, Under-Secretary of State for Air, visited Habbaniya air base in September during the course of a tour of all the Royal Air Force stations in the Middle East. J Nuri Said. 62. The possibility of Nuri Pasha’s return to public life has been an important factor m Iraqi politics ever since the murder of Bekr Sidqi, in August 1937, enabled him to come back to Iraq from his exile in Egypt. For the greater part of the year, however, he remained abroad occupied mainly with his private endeavours to bring about a settlement of the problem of Palestine. Nevertheless each of his three visits to Bagdad caused lively political rumours to be put into circulation. 1 63. He left Iraq early in January and went to London by way of Cairo. In London he had talks about Palestine with Mr. Ormsby Gore and Lord Cranborne and returned to Bagdad on the 8th February. On his way back he visited the Mufti of Jerusalem in the Lebanon, and discussed with him what are known as the Hyamson-Newcombe proposals for the future of the Jewish ational Home. He left Iraq again for Syria towards the end of March and[18698] c* 2 remained there throughout the summer in close touch with Arab leaders, many of whom spent the summer in the Lebanon. On the 12th September he set out once more for London, where he joined forces with Taufiq-as-Suwaidi, the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, in early October and co-operated with him in representing the Arab case to the Foreign Office and the Colonial Office. 64. On the 22nd October he reappeared in Bagdad, but set out for London once more a few days after the publication of the report of the Palestine Partition Commission. On his way he stayed several days in Cairo, where he discussed the Palestine question with members of the Egyptian Government. In the course of this visit to Bagdad, Nuri conveyed to me, through the counsellor of His Majesty’s Embassy, an intimation that a coup for which Nuri himself disclaimed all responsibility was in contemplation. I was myself at the time unwell, but Mr. Houstoun-Boswall communicated to Nuri, at my request, a warning against the dangers of disrupting the administration of the country by unconstitional movements of any kind. 65. On the 20th December he returned suddenly, and a few days later became Prime Minister in circumstances already described in this report. Repercussions of Events in Palestine. 66. All classes of people in Iraq continued closely to follow events in Palestine throughout the year. 67. The text of the despatch of the Secretary of State for the Colonies of the 23rd December, 1937, to the High Commissioner for Palestine, on the subject of the policy of His Majesty’s Government in that country, was published in Iraq on the 5th January. Comment in the press was uniformly unfavourable. There had, it was declared, already been more than enough commissions, enquiries and white papers to make the facts perfectly clear, and nothing helpful to the Arabs could be expected from the work of the so-called technical commission which was now to be sent out. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, in discussing the matter with His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, said that although the aim of the despatch was avowedly to dispel if possible the uncertainty which appeared to exist with regard to the course of action which His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom had in view, he found it so cautiously worded that it was difficult to understand what it really meant. 68. Meanwhile, the Palestine Defence League and other associations of a political and semi-political kind were keeping alive agitation and strengthening their propaganda in the provinces. The 28th January was declared a day of prayers and intercession for the souls of the Palestinian martyrs. Special editions of the newspapers were published and the services in the mosques were crowded. Telegrams of protest were sent to the League of Nations and to foreign legations in Bagdad. 69. About the same time several communications were addressed to me protesting against the outrages which it was alleged were being committed by the British troops in Palestine, and a resolution was passed in the Chamber of Deputies expressing deep concern at the situation and urging His Majesty s Government to hasten a just solution of the whole Palestinian question. 70. When I arrived in Bagdad in the middle of March I was authorised to inform the Minister for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty’s Government appreciated the efforts made by the Iraqi Government to ensure that public feeling about Palestine did not manifest itself in objectionable forms, and to explain the principal points of the Secretary of State for the Colonies despatch of December 1937. The Minister was gratified with this message, and renewed earlier assurances that the Iraqi Government were genuinely anxious that nothing should take place in Iraq which might prove embarrassing to His Majesty’s Government. 71. Early in April the situation in Palestine was once more discussed in the Chamber of Deputies during a debate on the budget vote for the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. All speakers referred to their desire for close friendship with~ , ■ 12 Great Britain and to their regret that British policy in Palestine should have had so disastrous an effect on the old friendship between the British and Arab peoples. 72. The Minister for Foreign Affairs recalled his speech on Palestine at the last meeting of the Assembly of the League of Nations, and assured the Chamber that the Iraqi Government would not cease to make representations to His Majesty’s Government with a view to protecting the interests of the Arabs in Palestine. 73. A short while after, the Minister for Foreign Affairs handed me a memorandum in which the Iraqi Government made formal representations on the subject of the situation in Palestine. It contained nothing objectionable in tone and nothing original in argument. Its conclusion was that the only just solution would be a settlement on the lines of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930, with a final limitation of Jewish immigration which would preserve permanently an Arab majority in the country. At the same time similar memoranda were, by agreement between the Governments concerned, communicated to His Majesty’s Government by Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. 74. The arrival in Palestine of the Technical Commission was the signal tor renewed agitation. Branches of the Palestine Defence League despatched protests to the President and the Bagdad newspapers forecast complete failure for the commission’s work. Shortly afterwards, the Prophet’s Birthday, which tell on the 12th May, was made the occasion for special manifestations of hatred tor the policy of partition and of sympathy with the Palestinian Arabs in their struggle against Zionism. 75. In the meantime the Palestine Defence League had been organising collec tions throughout Iraq on behalf of the victims of the disturbances in Palestine r^ U /^^ W i S i hed hy ^ e Lea g' ue in June showed that up to the end of May a total ot f 1 ’* 40 had been collected and remitted to the Women’s Committee in Jerusalem and the Central Palestine Relief Committee in Damascus. A little later it was stated that a further remittance of £500 had been sent to Palestine. 76 - 5 n 1 ( l. u l r ^ es rev ealed that as regards Syria, no such body as the Central Palestine Relief Committee existed, and that the £800 sent from Iraq to Damascus had gone to the Syrian branch of the Palestine Defence League, which was mainly occupied with the purchase of arms, the recruitment of terrorists and the payment of compensation to wounded insurgents. As regards Palestine it was established that the total amount received by the Arab Women’s Committee since the beginning of the year was only £70. 77. In these circumstances, and acting on instructions, I addressed a note to the Iraqi Government drawing their attention to the fact that funds which were being collected in Iraq for an ostensibly charitable purpose, were being directed to organisations whose purpose was to encourage the insurgents in Palestine, and enquired what steps the authorities proposed to take to ensure that the money collected was devoted to the purpose for which it was subscribed. 78. In their official reply, the Iraqi Government merely stated that it had been ascertained that most of the money collected for relief work in Palestine had been sent to the Secretary-General of the Central Committee for the Relief A u a l*r tmia ? ^ uffere . rs at Dama scus, and that £70 had been remitted to the Arab Womens Committee at Jerusalem. No information was offered con cerning the control of future collections. Unofficially, however, the Minister for roreign Affairs told me that a strong hint had been given to the league to send more money to the Women’s Committee at Jerusalem and less to the Relief Committee at Damascus. 79. In July Jewish reprisals on Arabs began in Palestine and Arab feeling i WaS at ° nCe inc 1 ensed - A Palestine Day, similar to that held on the mh M a y, was organised on the 5th August by the Palestine Defence Lea-ue and three days ater fatwas were given by leading Shiah and Sunni Divines declaring that all Arabs were in honour bound to join their brothers in Palestine13 &amp;&gt; in their struggle, and that jihad for the sake of Palestine had become a duty for all Moslems, not only by the law of religion, but also by the rulings of conscience and right thinking. 80. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at once made representations to the Iraqi Government, and urged them to take firm measures to prevent disorder breaking out and to check the activities of the Shiah and Sunni Clema. The response was immediate. Permission for public processions was refused and the press were told to give no support to the fatwas. The Minister for loreign Affairs also gave an undertaking that the Government would do their best to prevent men from going from Iraq to join the insurgents in Palestine, and to ensure that money was not sent from Iraq to help the insurgents. 81. On the 13th August a bomb exploded in the garden of a Jewish social club and injured two children. A second bomb was found unexploded in another Jewish club on the following morning. For a while there seemed to be a danger that an organised attack on Jewish lives and property might develop, but the Government again acted with energy. Stern warnings were given to those likely to be behind such a movement, and the fullest police protection was arranged for the Jewish quarter. The result of these measures was excellent and no further outrages of the kind took place until the 22nd October, when a bomb was again thrown into the club gardens where the first explosion had occurred. Three young men were hit by fragments of metal and one of them died from his injuries a few days later. 82. On the 7th October, at the invitation of Muhammed Ali Alubba Pasha, what was called an Arab Parliamentary Conference on Palestine was opened in Cairo. Iraq was represented by a delegation of nine Deputies, headed by Maulud Mukhlis, the president of the Iraqi Chamber of Deputies. 83. The conference ended on 11th October. The principal resolutions passed were :— That the Balfour Declaration should be declared null and void; That all further Jewish immigration into Palestine should be stopped; That a constitutional Government should be set up with proportional representation for Jews and Arabs; and That a treaty of alliance should be concluded between Great Britain and Palestine similar to the Anglo-Iraqi treaty of 1930; That a permanent executive committee should be set up in Cairo to continue the work of the conference. 84. A delegation, headed by Alubba Pasha, afterwards went to London to present these resolutions to His Majesty s Government, but no Iiaqi lepiesenta- tive accompanied them. 85. In the meanwhile, the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, Taufiq-as- Suwaidi, had been representing the Arab view of the Palestine question to the League of Nations at Geneva, and, afterwards, to His Majesty’s Government when during the first week in October, he was an official guest in London. 86 The scheme which he recommended to the Secretary of State for the Colonies had four main points, viz. : (i) the limitation of the Jewish population to one-third of the Arab population; (ii) the autonomy of the Jewish community in matters of personal status; (iii) the grant of wide municipal powers to Jewish towns' and (iv) the conclusion of a treaty of alliance between Palestine and Great Britain which would safeguard British interests and provide guarantees for the rights and liberties of minorities. 87. On the 9th November a demonstration of students and school boys was worked up by the Palestine Defence League to voice public displeasure with British policy in Palestine. In spite of the leaders’ undertakings to the authorities that the demonstration would be peaceful, the disorderly elements soon got out of hand and much damage was done to shop-fronts in the main street of Bagdad. Many British subjects suffered and their total losses m broken shop-fronts and looted goods amounted to over £200. In Basr a effoits were made to organise a similar demonstration. There, however, the mutessarif dealt [18698] c * 314 firmly with the situation. The police dispersed the students with a heavy hand and half a dozen boys were soundly flogged. Questions were asked in the Chamber, but the Government loyally supported the mutessarif’s action. 88. The statement about Palestine made by His Majesty’s Government on the 9th November was, on the whole, well received by the Iraqi Government. The Minister for Foreign Affairs urged, however, that, in order that the discussions might be conducted in a favourable atmosphere, sympathetic consideration should be given to the following proposals before they began :— That Jewish immigration should be stopped until the discussions had been concluded. That an assurance should be given that if the Arab insurgents dispersed they would not be hunted down individually. That arrangements should be made for the Arabs of Palestine to be fully represented at the discussions. 89. It was not possible for His Majesty’s Government to contemplate the stoppage of Jewish immigration into Palestine pending the result of the London discussions, as it was held that to do so would be to prejudge one of the most important questions to be discussed. Nor was it possible for them to agree immediately to give the assurance suggested concerning Arab insurgents. At the same time I was authorised to inform the Minister for Foreign Affairs that his suggestion would receive careful consideration and that some such step might be possible when the Palestine Arab delegation had been formed and was ready to go to London. As regards the representation of the Arabs of Palestine, I was instructed to tell the Minister for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty’s Govern ment considered it important that the Palestine Arab delegation should be really representative of Palestine opinion and that active consideration was being given to the means by which the Palestine Arabs might choose their own delegation. 90. After protracted conversations with Taufiq-as-Suwaidi the latter, on the 20th November, and in accordance with a suggestion advanced by myself, addressed me a note informing me that the Iraqi Government, after taking note of the statements of His Majesty’s Government that the necessary arrangements had been made to afford to the Palestinian Arabs an opportunity to choose their representatives in a manner which would satisfy their wishes/had pleasure in accepting the invitation which had been addressed to them to send a representative to the London discussions. 91. The remaining weeks of the year were devoted to efforts to persuade the Iraqi Government, in collaboration with the Governments of Egypt and Saudi Arabia, to recommend to His Majesty’s Government a delegation of suitable persons to represent the Palestine Arabs at these discussions. 92. During the latter half of the year the private broadcasting station set up by King Ghazi in his residential palace frequently included in its news bulletin some of the worst of the allegations of cruelty put into circulation against the British troops in Palestine. It also emitted scurrilous reports about the'Amir Abdullah of Transjordan. On more than one occasion I remonstrated with His Majesty, who responded with reassuring promises that the news bulletins would be purged of objectionable matter. It seems, however, that King Ghazi cannot for long resist the temptation to be mischievous, and shortly before their fall at the end of December the Government were considering ways and means of putting the palace station under departmental control or even of suppressing it altogether The Pan-Arab Movement. 93. A number of opportunities were found during the year to continue the work of strengthening racial solidarity among Arab countries. 94. In February the Tenth Annual Congress of the Egyptian Medical Asso ciation took place in Bagdad. About 230 doctors from Egypt, Syria and Iraq took part. The Syrians and Iraqis were disposed to give the proceedings a pan-Arab political character, but this tendency was, on the whole, resisted by the Egyptians Nevertheless, at the many social gatherings arranged for the congress the pan Arabians found ample opportunity to propagate their political views’and thev were well supported by the Iraqi press. ’ J[18698] c * 4 15 95. At about the same time, at the invitation of the Ministry of Education, thirty members of a Damascus athletic club paid an official visit to Bagdad. They were well entertained and played several football matches against Iraqi teams. Between the games and the parties they talked a great deal about pan-Arabian ideals. 96. February also saw the elaborately organised celebrations which marked the first anniversary of Yasin Pasha’s death. Delegates from Palestine and Syria (all well-known extreme Nationalists) came to Bagdad for the occasion and their speeches, and those of the Iraqi organisers, especially, praised Yasin for his work for Arab political unity. 97. At the end of July a party of thirty Iraqi boy scouts joined a camp in the Lebanon organised by the Syrian Scouts’ Association. They visited Damascus en route and were cordially entertained by the local Arab societies. 98. The Iraqi Ministry of Education continued to encourage young Arabs from other countries to come to Iraq for their education. During the year groups of students arrived from Aden, the Yemen, Hadhramaut, Bahrein, Zanzibar, Sumatra, Lahaj, Oman and Muscat. Many of these were given bursaries by the Ministry. 99. At the Arab Parliamentary Conference on Palestine in Cairo in October a resolution was proposed advocating the union of Syria, Iraq and Palestine and Transjordan as a means of saving the Arabs of Palestine from becoming over whelmed by the Jews. This was the first occasion for a long time that such a project had been seriously discussed at so representative a gathering. The resolution was not adopted, because the majority were persuaded that it was better to deal with Palestine separately as an independent issue, but, in principle, it received general support. 100. In the speech delivered by King Ghazi at the opening of Parliament on the 1st November there was a noteworthy passage which gave much satisfaction to the political press as an indication of the Government’s intention to go on working steadily to strengthen Arab unity. King Ghazi said: “Our Government are sensible of the responsibilities which devolve upon Iraq as an active member of that community of Arab States who are charged with the mission of peace and civilisation in the Near East and on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. For this reason, our Government follow with great interest the success of our neigh bour Syria in her cause so that she may be able to take up her position as a member of this community.” 101. A delegation of about twenty members of the Arab Club of Damascus visited Bagdad in November. They were the guests of the Ministry of Education and remained in the capital for about a fortnight. During this period they were shown all the best achievements of the Iraqi public services, hospitals, schools and bridges and the most up-to-date units of the Iraqi army. In addition, they were made much of by the Arab clubs, which entertained them with dinners and speeches. 102. The organisation which is most actively fostering pan-Arab ideals in Iraq is the Nadi-al-Muthanna, a club named after the Arab hero Muthanna-bin- Harithah, one of the early conquerors of Iraq. It was founded in 1935 by Dr. Saib Shawkat, who is still its leading member. Round him are gathered a number of enthusiasts, mostly Syrian and Palestinian teachers working in Bagdad. The club’s chief activities are lectures, meetings organised to pass resolutions on current events of importance, and tea parties for Arab visitors of note. During the year the club has given ready support to the Palestine Defence League and has allowed the league to make their headquarters in the club’s premises. 103. On the 30th December the Muthanna Club organised a Tripoli day as a protest against the Italian absorption of the four provinces of Libya, All newspapers published articles denouncing the action of the Italian Government, and at a meeting held at the Muthanna Club speakers called upon the Arabs of Iraq to help and support their brother Arabs in Tripoli.16 Public Opinion on the European Crisis of September. 104. Ihroughout the latter stages of the critical events which preceded the conclusion on the 30th September of the Munich Agreement concerning the Sudeten German population of Czecho-Slovakia, public interest in Iraq was keen and groups of eager listeners gathered in the streets and coffee-shops to hear the Arab news bulletins broadcast from London, Palestine, Cairo and Bagdad Luring the last few days before the Munich meeting anxiety became acute. Many nervous householders began to hoard food, and the market prices for imported tood-stuffs rose rapidly to as much as 30 per cent, above the normal. The press reflected the public mind by giving front-page positions to the day-to-day news trom Europe, but were chary of offering criticism or attempting to appreciate the potentialities of the situation. Such comment as was offered was however unanimous in the praise of Mr Chamberlain’s efforts for peace; and on the mh September the Iraqi Prime Minister sent telegrams to Herr Hitler at Munich and to I resident Benes at Prague appealing to them to continue unceasingly to search for a peaceful settlement of the questions at issue and to save the world from the calamity of war. Notable Iraqis, when speaking to members of the embassy staff, paid similar tributes to Mr. Chamberlain, but many were anxious for the future and some openly wondered what Great Britain would do about Germany’s colonial claims. Education. nf eff ? r [ s m ade in 1937 to obtain for Iraqi students easier conditions of entry into British universities resulted during the current year in a decision y authorities of the Universities of Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester Sheffield, Leeds, Wales, Bristol, Beading and Durham to accept, as a qualification tv a . dl “ ss . 10 , n ’ th ® secondary school certificate, plus a certificate given by the Iraqi Ministry of Education to the effect that the student is fitted to undertake the course of university studies which he desires to follow. ;E: “i™ Ei n »“;“ a * o ' 107. At the close of the year under review over fifty Iraqi students were in thTulftedtingX. 0 ” ° f University or P^duate studies ITS. The matriculation school organised in 1936 to prepare secondary school graduates to continue their studies in foreign universities now carries on the same work under the name of School of Languages.

During the second half of the year the possibility of profiting fiom Egyptian experience in public education was studied in the Ministry of Education, and there was some talk of working towards a common curriculum lor all Arab countries based on that used in the Egyptian schools. In November Ai baiyicl Jabil Jawad, an Iraqi inspector of schools, visited Egypt to study this proposal in detail. Communications. 114. Good progress was made during 1938 with the construction of the Tel-Kotchek-Mosul-Baiji Railway extension. Mechanical excavators have facilitated rapid work on the northern (Tel-Kotchek-Mosul) section, which has been completed as far as Subaniyah station. As track-laying is pro ceeding at the rate of 1 kilom. a day, the line should reach Mosul before the end of January 1939. The foundations of the new station and rest- house at Mosul have been laid. On the Mosul-Baiji section work is being carried out simultaneously at various points, and the track has already been built up to a point 50 kilom. north of the junction with the old line. The Railway Administration hope that the entire line will be ready for service in October next. Expenditure on the line, including the purchase of rolling-stock and equipment, already amounts to £1.900,000, and a further £1 million will be required in 1939^ making its total cost nearly £3 million. Orders for rolling-stock to a value of over £700,000 have been placed in the United Kingdom, in addition to substantial contracts for the supply of construction materials 115. At the beginning of the year the Kampsax consortium made a further bid for a monopoly of road construction in Iraq by offering to execute the Govern ment’s 5,000 kilom. scheme on a 5 per cent, commission, as against 6 per cent, in their original proposal, provided that the annual expenditure was not less than £150,000. Their offer was again turned down, partly owing to shortage of funds. 116. The Capital Works Eive Years’ Plan approved in April 1938 includes an expenditure of I.D. 450,000 on bridges and ED. 750,000 on roads. Some I.D. 360,000 of the former sum is earmarked for the two bridges now in course of construction over the Tigris at Bagdad. In November the Minister of Finance announced that road construction had been suspended throughout Iraq, as the methods used were not giving satisfactory results, and that further expenditure would not be undertaken until a definite road policy had been formulated. To that end it had been decided to recruit an expert road engineer from Europe with experience of conditions similar to those in Iraq (see paragraph 164). 117. In April the Iraqi Government informed His Majesty’s Embassy that certain of the improvements to the section of the Bagdad Haifa road lying in Iraqi territory, which His Majesty’s Government desired should be undertaken, had already been put in hand, and that the other improvements had been sanctioned in principle, provision having been made for them in the Capital Works budget for 1938-39. Parliamentary sanction was subsequently obtained, but the work has not been started owing to excessive rains. The bridge oyer the Wadi Hauran, west of Rutbah, the building of which was commenced in the spring, has, however, been completed and the Iraqi Government is negotiating with a local firm of British contractors who have offered to carry out general repairs to the Bagdad—Damascus track along a stretch 50 miles east and west of Rutbah. A tender has been submitted and is now being studied by the Ministry of Finance. ' III. —Foreign Relations. British Empire. General. British War Graves in Iraq. 118. Brigadier-General Sir Herbert Hart, the Chief Administrative Officer of the Imperial War Graves Commission (Eastern District), visited Iraq, as last year, in the early spring and attended on the 28th March, at His Majesty’s Embassy, the third meeting of the Iraq Committee, which was held under my [18698] D*18 chairmanship, the other members present including the Air Officer Commanding, the acting head of the military mission and the adviser to the Ministry of the Interior. 119. Various matters were discussed, with the following results : — (1) Following the resolution passed at the last meeting of the committee, the Imperial War Graves Commission resolved in April 1937 that Captain G. H. Peek should be appointed secretary to the committee. (2) It was reported that a schedule of the lands in Iraq used for war cemeteries, graves and memorials, complete with plans, had been duly prepared and lodged at His Majesty’s Embassy in case it should be required by the Iraqi Government. (3) The Chief Administrative Officer reported that the Indian Association and the Moslem authorities concerned had been asked whether they would consent to the removal of the Hindu and Moslem graves in the Bagdad (right bank) cemetery to the Bagdad (north gate) cemetery, since no title had been acquired by the commission to the former cemetery, and land in its vicinity was likely to be built upon. The Indian Association had agreed, but the Moslem authorities had objected. The committee therefore agreed that no further steps should be taken concerning the proposed removal of the cemetery in question. (4) At its meeting last year the committee had asked the adviser to the Iraqi Ministry of Justice to ascertain from the Iraqi Government the nature of the steps to be taken to have the titles to the cemeteries and memorials in Iraq re-registered in the names of the Governments of the United Kingdom and the Dominions, in accordance with the exchange of notes attached to the agreement of 1935 regarding British war cemeteries, &amp;c., in Iraq. Mr. Drower reported that there had been a certain delay, but that the Iraqi Department concerned now required all Tapu certificates to be produced at the Registry Office, Bagdad, when the necessary re-registration would be effected and the Tapu certificates amended accordingly. The meeting therefore recom mended that the Tapu certificates held in London should be produced at the Registry Office, Bagdad, as requested. (5) The committee also supported a request being made to the Iraqi Govern ment for all requirements of the Imperial War Graves Commission to be admitted into Iraq free of customs duties and dues. 120. By the end of the year the re-registration of some of the Tapu certificates referred to under (4) above had been effected and lodged with the embassy. The others are awaited. So far as (5) above is concerned, the difficulty was that, whereas before the agreement of 1935 with Iraq all the commission’s requirements were admitted into Iraq free of customs duties and dues subse quently to the agreement such charges were levied on all articles not specified in article 7 thereof {'Le all articles not directly used for the maintenance or construc- tion of graves), the assistance of the adviser to the Ministry of the Interior was ®®j* st ® d ?. vl &lt;? w to g| v ; n g effect to the committee’s resolution of the 28tfi Maich, but by the end of the year the matter had not yet been settled Civil Procedure Convention. venti^of^owTqlf 8 the ?

No result was obtained; and in May I learned that they were, in fact, on the point of refusing to participate. They particularly disliked, apparently, two features of the proposals under which they would have to retuna to His Maiesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, by way 01 subsidy, any amount over and above the sum of £6,000 per annum which they (the Iraqi Government) might receive annually from duties on petrol and oil used m the service, and would be bound to pay for the transport of mails between Bagdad and Lake Habbaniya. As a result the embassy were authorised in June to submit yet further proposals to the Iraqi Government, under which the latter wo 0i d T® absolved from refunding the amount received m duties on fuel over ^£6,000 provided they increased their annual contribution to the scheme (the postal payment ”) from £6,000 to £12,000. His Majesty’s Government felt unable to modify the principle that each participating country should make its own arrangements to collect and distribute the mails, but they signified their readiness, as a substantial contribution towards the cost of transport, to reduce the above- mentioned payment by the Iraqi Government from one of £12,000 to one of £10,500 per annum. The arrangement would, however, be subject to revision if the fuel duties levied on the service were to be increased. 123. The embassy placed these new proposals before the Iraqi Government in July, but again without any immediate result. In the meantime, the embassy received instructions to invite the Iraqi Government to participate in a conference for the purpose of drawing up a convention regarding the exemption from taxation of liquid fuel and lubricants used in air traffic. As it seemed that to issue such an invitation to the Iraqi Government might well prejudice the chances of the latter accepting the Empire Air Mail Scheme, the embassy referred to the Foreign Office for instructions and was authorised to assure the Iraqi Govern ment in inviting them to attend the conference, that if for any reason fuel duties were abolished or reduced in Iraq, their proposed contribution of £6,000 in respect of such duties under the Empire Air Mail Scheme would be reduced in proportion. 124. During the visit to London in the autumn of the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs the Secretary of State took occasion to refer to the delay which had occurred and to tell him that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom hoped to hear soon that their proposals regarding the air mail scheme were acceptable to the Iraqi Government. 125. In March the embassy under instructions asked the Iraqi Government that the facilities enjoyed by Imperial Airways for the flight of their aircraft across Iraq might be extended to the Indian Trans-Continental Airways and Quantas Empire Airways (the latter being nominated by His Majesty’s Govern ment in Australia), who it was proposed should collaborate with Imperial Airways in operating over the route between the United Kingdom, India and Australia. The Iraqi Government in July acceded to His Majesty’s Government’s request. 126. On the evening of the 27th November the Imperial Airways flying- boat Calpurnia, carrying mail (but no passengers) on the eastbound flight to India, crashed in attempting to alight on Lake Habbaniya, and, of a crew of six, the commander and three other persons lost their lives. United Kingdom. Iraqi Diplomatic Representation. 127. During the year there was yet another change in the Iraqi military attacheship in London (see paragraph 117 of last year’s report), Colonel Ismail Hakki Ibrahim being replaced by Colonel Hamid Nasrat. The new military attache graduated at the Iraqi Staff College, where he later returned as an instructor. Military Mission. 128. Major-General H. W. M. Watson, who was appointed Inspector- General in 1937, died, while on sick leave in England, on the 23rd March, 1938. In his place Major-General G. G. Waterhouse, M.C., an engineer officer and graduate of the Staff College, who served in the European war in France and Salonika, and was military attache in Paris in 1931, was appointed. Major-General20 Waterhouse who had also served in the military mission in Iraq as Inspector of the Q.M.G.s Branch from 1934 to 1937, arrived in Bagdad and took up his appointment in August. 129. At the end of March the Iraqi Government asked for two British officers to serve as instructors at the Iraqi Staff College on three-year contracts. ^ The officers eventually appointed to these posts, with the agreement of the Iraqi Government, were Major J. L. Spencer, Hampshire Regiment, and Major J. R. Waters, R.A. 130. Colonel M. Everett, D.S.O., Inspector of Army Training, whose contract was due to expire on the 22nd January, 1939, left Iraq for good on accumulated leave of absence on the 25th July. The inspector-general was anxious that he should be replaced, but the Iraqi Government resisted this idea, and by the end of the year the inspector-general had decided not to press it. 131. In July the Iraqi Government asked for a British officer to be engaged, on a two years’ contract, as instructor at the Small Arms School. After certain considerations had been represented to the Iraqi Government with a view to making the officer’s proposed terms of service correspond with those of the rest of the mission (to this the Iraqi Government duly agreed) the application was forwarded to the Foreign Office. In December His Majesty’s Government suggested that Captain J. M. Sym, Seaforth Highlanders, as a suitable candidate for this post, and his name was communicated to the Iraqi Government at the end of the year. 132. In September the Iraqi Government requested His Majesty’s Govern ment to nominate a British squadron-leader for the appointment of Inspector of Air Training in Iraq. The officer selected for this post, which will be a new appointment in the military mission, was Squadron-Leader N. C. Ogilvie-Forbes. 133. On the 20th December the members of the mission were received in audience by King Ghazi. This was the first occasion upon which His Majesty had received the mission as a whole. 134. The following were the officers of the military mission at the end of 1938 :— Inspector-General: Major-General G. G. Waterhouse M C Inspector, Q.M.G.’s Branch : Colonel D. 0. W. Lamb, O.B E Inspector, Artillery : Major H. M. J. McIntyre, R.A. Staff Officer to the Inspector-General and Inspector of Infantry • Maior F. D. S. Fripp. J Inspector, Weapon Training : Major C. P. Warren M C Instructor, Staff College : Major J. L. Spencer. ’ ' ' Instructor, Staff College : Major J. R. Waters. Inspector, Ordnance Services : Major A. H.

Culley, D.S.O Assistant Inspector, Royal Iraqi Air Force : Flight Lieutenant W. S. Reed. Courses for Iraqi Officers in the United Kingdom and India. a In 5 ’ r Early 111 the / e T ar , His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India agreed that the number of Iraqi officers to be admitted as students to the Staff College at Camberley should be maintained at four, and of those admitted to the Staff College, Quetta, at a maximum of two annuaHy. i his decision, however, took effect at the same time as a reorganisation of the com ses at these colleges, under which there were to be as from the 1st January 1939, junior and senior courses of one year each, and foreign officers were to be admitted to the junior courses only. In informing the Iraqi Govern ment, however, of this decision, the embassy was authorised to explain that His Majesty s Government would endeavour to arrange that in 1939 and future years such facilities for attachments and training-school courses as the Iraqi Govern ment desired should be afforded to officers who had completed the shortened course[18698] D * 3 21 n 4s* in the United Kingdom. The Government of India shortly afterwards gave a similar undertaking and also expressed their readiness to raise the number of Iraqi officers admissible annually to the Staff College at Quetta from two to four. 136. The Iraqi Government appeared to be satisfied with these arrangements yrs and in November nominated four officers to take the revised staff course at Quetta. 137. Good reports have been received of the Iraqi officers who worked at the Staff Colleges at Camberley and Quetta during 1938. Iraqi officers who have attended other courses in the United Kingdom have worked hard, but have m many cases been handicapped by an insufficient knowledge of English. The Chief of the General Staff of the Iraq army fully realises the necessity of officers who study in the United Kingdom being equipped with a good knowledge of English, and has authorised the granting of money rewards to officers who pass language examinations. Visit of Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs to London. 138. Taufiq-as-Suwaidi, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, accompanied by Mr. Edmonds, adviser to the Ministry of the Interior, paid a visit to London during the first half of October, after he had attended the meeting of the League Assembly at Geneva. While in London he discussed with the Secretary of State and members of the Foreign Office such questions as Palestine, Alexandretta, the Syrian Treaty, Koweit and the question of guards for the Royal Air Force bases in Iraq. He also had an interview with the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the subject of Palestine, at which Nuri Pasha, who had arranged to be in London at the same time, was present. 139. The Iraqi point of view on these questions, as presented by Taufiq-as- Suwaidi, is dealt with in detail under the relevant headings in this report. Air Defence Force. 140. It will be recalled that at the end of 1937 the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs informed Sir Archibald Clark Kerr that he had been instructed by the Cabinet to reopen discussions with a view to creating, in a manner agreeable to both Governments, the special force for the protection of the Royal Air Force bases in Iraq for which provision was made in article 4 of the annexure to the 4 reaty of Alliance of 1930 (see paragraph 122 of last year’s report). Accordingly, in February Taufiq-as-Suwaidi wrote to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires a letter, su^resting the formation of this force from the Iraqi army, the force to ha\e as its commander a British officer (a member of the British military mission) and to include in itself a portion of the Assyrian levies. After consultation with the Foreign Office, I submitted to Taufiq-as-Suwaidi for his consideration at the end of May a’draft law establishing the Air Defence Force (based on a draft which had been prepared in 1932). The principal features of this draft law were that the force should be at the sole disposal of the Air Officer Commanding for all purposes connected with the security of the Royal Air Force in Iraq, that it should be under the command of a British officer; and that it should be composed of Iraqi personnel not exceeding 1,250 and such British officeis and othei lanks as might be necessary. 141. Nothing further was heard of the matter from the Iraqi Government until the autumn, when Taufiq-as-Suwaidi, during his visit to London, submitted to His Majesty’s Government a proposal that the defence force should be formed either from the regular Iraqi army (in which case the commanding officer should be a British officer attached to the military mission) or from the Iraqi police. In view, however, of the difficulties arising from the divided control of such a force, His Majesty’s Government countered with a suggestion (which they explained would need further examination before it could be considered a definite proposal) that they should waive their treaty right to ask the Iraqi Government to provide special guards, and that the Royal Air Force should themselves provide for their own ground defence without maintaining the present levies or any other force composed of Iraqi subjects. 142. Taufiq-as-Suwaidi said that this was an entirely new suggestion and indicated that he would obtain the Iraqi Government’s views upon it. These views, however, had not been received by the end of the year.mmm ’ •'&gt; ’’ A 22 The Purchase of Armaments. 143. It will be recalled (see paragraph 127 of last year s report) that, so far as the seven reconditioned 3* 7-inch howitzers offered by His Majesty’s Govern ment to the Iraqi Government (in response to the latter’s original demand for ten) were concerned, the position at the end of 1937 was that four of these guns could be supplied by about May 1938 and three during the winter of 1939. - Early in 1938, however, the Iraqi Government were informed that the last three of the howitzers could be ready for shipment by about July 1938, subject to certain qualifications in the case of ancillary stores. The Iraqi Government accepted the offer of the total seven howitzers on these conditions, and the guns arrived in Iraq during the course of the year. 144. In May the Ministry for Foreign Affairs succeeded in obtaining from the Ministry of Defence, and forwarded to the embassy, a complete list of the guns and other warlike stores required by the Iraqi Government during 1938-42. This list included 96 18-pounder guns (32 during 1938), 20 4-5-inch howitzers (from 1939 to 1942) and 24 3* 7-inch howitzers (8 during 1938). The Minister for Foreign Affairs pointed out, however, that so far as he understood, the M ar Office intended to arm British field artillery with the new 25-pounder gun. This gun would not be available for sale to the Iraqi army until 1941 or 1942. Mean while, that army had to obtain guns for their new batteries and 18-pounders and 4-5-inch howitzers were the only types available. The Iraqi Government proposed, therefore, that they should accept and pay for good second-hand 18-pounder and 4-5-inch howitzer equipments on the understanding that His Majesty’s Government would accept the money paid for them as part payment for the 25-pounders by which they would eventually be replaced. (Taufiq-as-Suwaidi mentioned, incidentally, that a German firm had offered delivery within two years of a dual purpose gun similar to the British 25-pounder on attractive terms.) Of the items on the Iraqi Government’s list, sixteen of the thirty-two 18-pounder guns required during 1938 were already in course of delivery from India (with one further such gun from the United Kingdom they arrived in Iraq during the year), while the figure of eight 3-7-inch howitzers for 1938 similarly included the seven guns referred to in paragraph 143 above. It was estimated that the total number of 25-pounders wdiich the Iraqi Government would eventually require (though this was not stated in the list) would be 116. 145. The Iraqi requirements were duly forwarded to His Majesty's Govern ment. The latter replied in July that, so far as the 3-7-inch howitzers were concerned, no new guns of this type were available in 1938, but that reconditioned ones could be supplied, which would complete the eight required by the Iraqi Government during the year. They also explained that, provided a formal order were received in July 1938, the Government of India could supply two complete equipments a month from July 1939, which would give the Iraqi Government a total of eighteen equipments in place of the twelve which they said they required from April 1939 to March 1940. As regards the 18-pounder guns and 4-5-inch howitzers, these would be supplied at 50 per cent, and 60 per cent, of vocabulary prices respectively, and as and when they were returned to the United Kingdom in good condition credit would be allowed in abatement of the charges for the eventual 25-pounder equipments, this credit being the prices paid by the Iraqi Government for the two items in question less certain deductions in respect of handling by the War Department, depreciation, &amp;c. His Majesty’s Government also pointed out that there was another type of gun (the converted 18-pounder/ 25-pounder) which was considerably lighter than the 25-pounder, although almost equal to it in range, and suggested that the Iraqi Government might care to consider the advantages of this gun (which could be delivered earlier) before ordering the 25-pounders. 146. These proposals were duly put to the Iraqi Government. The latter replied that, as regards the 3-7-inch howitzers, they did not wish to accept the offer of one extra reconditioned equipment; that indents had been sent to India for thirteen new equipments; and that four more equipments would be required in 1940 and would be indented for later. As regards the 18-pounder guns and 4-5-inch howitzers, they accepted the proposals of His Majesty’s Government regarding price and credit towards the eventual 25-pounders, but pleaded for[18698] d* 4 reconsideration of the charges suggested for handling, depreciation, &amp;c. (They also signified that only twelve (not sixteen) 18-pounders would be required during 1938-39.) 147. His Majesty’s Government, on being informed of the Iraqi reply, agreed, in November, to waive the proposed depreciation charges in respect of the 18-pounder guns and 4-5-inch howitzers, but were unable to waive the cost ot handling, &amp;c., by the War Department, which represented essential services rendered. They agreed, however, to certain other modifications of terms suggested by the Iraqi Government, and their final offer was substantially more favourable than their original one. The new terms were put to the Iraqi Government at the end of November. 148. In the original list of Iraqi requirements there had been an item of 50,000 gas masks, to be supplied in four yearly instalments. The War Office were prepared to meet this demand, but in August the Iraqi Government signified that the demand had been “ postponed.” As this development coincided with rumours that a local agent had obtained an order for 50,000 German gas masks for the Iraqi army, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires made enquiries in the matter of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Mr. Houstoun-Boswall discovered that it was indeed the case that 50,000 German masks had been ordered, but was able, by his representations, to secure the cancellation of the order, and the acceptance by the Iraqi Government of British masks on the terms offered by the War Office. 149. Early in the year the embassy learned that the Iraqi Government had bought a number of anti-aircraft guns from Germany {cf. paragraph 125 of the report for 1937). The Minister for Foreign Affairs admitted this was so, but said that these guns had been ordered and paid for before the Government of which he was a member took office. Acting on instructions, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires expressed surprise at the failure of the Iraqi Government to notify His Majesty’s Government of this commitment as soon as they learned of it, and added that, but for the fact that the guns had been ordered by the preceding Government, the matter would have justified a very strong protest indeed. Mr. Morgan also asked for an assurance that this order exhausted the list of commitments which the Iraqi Government had inherited from their predecessors. Taufiq-as-Suwaidi assured Mr. Morgan that, apart from the anti-aircraft guns ordered from Germany and the aeroplanes ordered from Italy (see paragraph 211), the Government had inherited no commitments for arms purchased outside the United Kingdom; and that since it had taken office no orders for arms and ammunition had been given to countries other than Great Biitam or India. The official (written) reply of the Iraqi Government was that, prior to their takino- office, the Ministry of Defence had purchased eighteen “ anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns ’ ’ from Germany, and that these guns were expected to be delivered early in Setember 1938. Towards the end of the year the embassy learned that these eighteen guns had, in fact, arrived. 150 Six hundred and fifty light Bren machine-guns, manufactured in Czecho-Slovakia, also arrived for the Iraq army during the year. Anglo-Italian Agreement of April 10, 1938. 151. Shortly before the conclusion of this agreement I was instructed to inform the Iraqi Government, in confidence, of the principal features of the agreement regarding certain areas in the Middle East which it was proposed to conclude as part of the main instrument. In doing so I explained that His Majesty’s Government had wished to give the Iraqi Government this information in regard to their intention in the spirit of the Anglo-Iraqi Alliance, and that I hoped they would agree with His Majesty’s Government in regarding an agree ment on these lines as of considerable advantage both to the United Kingdom and to Iraq and as being entirely in consonance with the spirit of the Treaty of Arab Brotherhood and Alliance. His Majesty’s Government felt sure that the Iraqi Government would share their desire to exclude other foreign Powers from gaining a foothold in any part of Saudi Arabia and the Yemen or interfering in their24 aftairs, and the only prospect of achieving that result had been by means of a self- denying ordinance applying inevitably to all Powers without distinction whether friendly neighbours or not of these two States. 152. While welcoming this explanation, the Iraqi Government were not altogether satisfied by it, and in May they asked His Majesty’s Government for a clarification of certain points in the Middle East Agreement. Hinting that they ^ would have preferred to have been given more time to consider the question, they stated that the agreement seemed to diminish the freedom of Saudi Arabia and the Yemen and so impede that closer co-operation between the Arab States, which was a principal object of the Treaty of Arab Brotherhood and Alliance; and they asked for assurances that there was nothing in the agreement to prevent:— (1) The exchange of territory with Saudi Arabia by mutual agreement. (2) A political union between Iraq and one or both of her Arab allies. (3) Any action by Iraq, concerted with Saudi Arabia, to suppress revolts in Saudi Arabia under the Arab Brotherhood Treaty. (4) The fulfilment by Iraq of her obligations under that treaty in the event of a conflict between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. 153. The Iraqi Government also asked for an assurance that nothing in the Anglo-Italian Agreement tended to prevent the enjoyment and execution of Iraq’s rights and obligations under article 7 of the Treaty of Arab Brotherhood (which provided for the parties’ co-operation with a view to unifying the cultural and military systems of their respective countries) or closer economic and financial co-operation between Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. 154. These questions were referred to His Majesty’s Government, who in June sent instructions enabling me to return the following replies. In the first place, I explained to the Iraqi Government that the Pome negotiations were of a complex character and that it was not possible to consult the Iraqi Government until the agreement had taken definite shape and His Majesty’s Government were in a position to give them a clear idea of its terms, which was not the case until the closing days of the negotiations. So far as points of substance were concerned, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the Yemen were not bound by the agreement, to which none of them was a party, and in consequence they were free, so far as the agree ment was concerned, to take any action which they thought desirable in their own interests, subject only to their treatv obligations, if any, to other Powers The provisions of the agreement designed to protect Saudi Arabia and the Yemen from foreign domination or intervention were, His Majesty’s Government considered, entirely consonant with the declared objects of the Treaty of Arab Brotherhood. Subject to certain general considerations and reservations the agreement could not deprive Iraq of the liberty of exchanging territory with her neighbour; a political union, however, between Iraq and one or both of her Arab allies, if it meant the merging of two States in one, would mean (1) that the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance would cease to operate unless amended by agree ment, (2) that so great a change had taken place that the Middle Eastern Agreement no longer applied. His Maiesty’s Government would not seek to oppose any action which Iraq might wish to take under the Arab Brotherhood Treaty, with the agreement of Saudi Arabia, to suppress disorders which wTre clearly of concern to both States; nor was Iraq committed not to take with her two Arab allies the measures of military, cultural, economic and financial co-opera ion described m paragraph 153 above. Finally, although that treaty appeared to make no prowsion for a conflict between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen P ff Imo felt herself bound to intervene m such a conflict His Majesty’s Government were not committed to oppose such intervention, but Iraq would be obliged under the ^ctfon aqi 7 e ’ t0 COnSUlt Great Britain befoire taking such 155. With these answers, which formed part of a detailed exnlanatirm appearedto b^satlsfied^ ^ M ' idIe EaStern A S reement . Iraqi Government Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance, 1930. 156. During the critical stages of the Central European crisis in Sentemlw His Majesty s Government kept the Iraqi Government, as their ally, regukrlyinformed of the development of the situation. There is no doubt that this action was appreciated by the Iraqi Government and made them all the more ready to take, towards the end of the month, certain precautionary measures (such as the reinforcement of police guards on bridges and a watch on foreign nationals) suggested to them by His Majesty’s Government in view of a possible outbreak of hostilities. 157. On the 28th September the Iraqi Prime Minister informed His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires that he had drawn the attention of the German Minister to Iraq’s obligations under the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance, and had told him that in the event of war German nationals could not he at liberty on Iraqi territory. Saiyid Jamil-al-Madfai said that he wished to con firm to Mr. Houstoun-Boswall in the most formal manner the assurance of Iraqi co-operation with His Majesty’s Government, and the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs handed Mr. Houstoun-Boswall a note stating that in the event of war the Iraqi Government would be ready to do all that was required by the existing undertakings between them and His Majesty’s Government. 158. The complete spontaneity with which the Iraqi Government assured His Majesty’s Government of their readiness to fulfil their obligations under the treaty was much appreciated by His Majesty’s Government, and lent additional emphasis to certain suggestions which I had made to the Foreign Office in July, with a view to bringing home to the Iraqi Government the full value to them of the alliance. It is easy at times to overlook the fact that considerable sections of Iraqi opinion tend to regard the alliance as a some what one-sided affair, from which Great Britain derives most of the advantages and Iraqi most of the obligations; and it is quite possible that this impression might be removed by, for instance, a greater show of intimacy in our diplomatic relations with Iraq, a greater measure of consultation with her in foreign affairs, and a more accommodating attitude towards her in matters of Iraqi interest, such as the supply of armaments. 159. In one important respect, indeed, a step forward was taken during the year. The Iraqi Government have always been anxious to learn the extent of the material assistance which His Majesty’s Government would afford to them in the event of Iraq being attacked by one or more of her neighbours. At the end of the summer His Majesty’s Government decided that this and other kindred matters could best be dealt with by drawing up a regular Anglo-Iraqi defence plan, and in October, acting on instructions, I suggested to the Iraqi Govern ment the holding of staff conversations with a view to such a plan being drawn up. This suggestion was being considered by the Iraqi Government at the end of the year. Registration of the Lands occv/pied by the Port of Basra. 160. In the course of his visit to London, Taufiq-as-Suwaidi asked the Foreign Office that the registration of certain property in the Port of Basra in the name of His Majesty s Government should be replaced by its registra tion in the name of the Iraqi Government. Under paragraph 5 of Sir Francis Humphrys’s note of the 19th August, 1930, to Xuri baid (the separate financial agreement appended to the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930) His Majesty s Government were only obliged to effect this transfer upon the establishment by the Iraqi Government of a port trust in accordance with agreed legislation. Despite this fact, however, and the Iraqi Government s manifest intention not to set up such a trust, His Majesty s Government signified their willingness to agree to the Iraqi request on condition— (a) That the Iraqi Government accepted full responsibility for any claims and liabilities relating to this property which had already arisen oi which might arise in the future. (b) The Iraqi Government would continue to repay the debt owing to His Majesty s Government in respect of the Port of Basra on the same terms and conditions as at present.K 26 (c) The rights of His Majesty's Government under paragraph 5 of the separate financial agreement with regard to the eventual constitution of a port trust for the Port of Basra remained unchanged. (d) Hie Iraqi Government would meet any dues, charges and expenses incidental to the transfer and reregistration of the property. 161. A draft exchange of notes for this purpose was submitted to the Iraqi Go\ernment in November, but by the end of the year that Government had offered no observations upon them. British Officials. 162. Mr. G. N. Loggin, C.M.G., who retired in 1936 as Director of Works in the Sudan, arrived in December and took up his duties as adviser to the Ministry of Economics and Communications, in succession to Mr. A. H. Wheatley, who had resigned in May 1937. 163. In December Mr. J. D. Atkinson, chief engineer to the Municipality of Alexandria, was selected by the Iraqi Government to be chief advisory expert to the Irrigation Department: he had not arrived in Iraq by the end of the year. 164. Thus two important posts were satisfactorily filled. Two other experts, a road engineer and an architect, required by the Minister of Economics and Communications to assist in his plans for economic development on sound lines, had not been secured by the end of the year. 165. Considerable difficulty was experienced in finding a suitable candidate to fill the vacancy in the court of first instance caused by the resignation in the spring of 1938 of Judge H. I. Lloyd. No suitable candidate had presented himself by the end of the year, and it was hoped by the Iraqi Government that they might be able to induce Judge Lloyd to return to Iraq. No doubt the dearth of candidates for these judgeships arises from the fact that the obligation on the Iraqi Government to employ a number of foreign judges ceases in October 1942. Consequently, contracts for only three years, with but scant prospect of renewal, have little attraction for men of an age at which they can best adapt themselves to local conditions and learn the local language 166. It is satisfactory to record that in a report submitted to the Chamber of Deputies by the Finance Committee, tribute was paid to the good work performed by the British Land Settlement Officers. 167. In September the Iraqi Government requested His Majesty’s Govern ment to recruit four British teachers of English for the Iraqi secondary schools. Ihese teachers were to be paid by the Iraqi Government, but it was considered to be more practical to recruit them yari passu with five further teachers whom the British Council had offered to provide (see paragraph 173 below). The Iraqi Government accepted His Majesty’s Government’s nominations, and by the end of the year five out of the total of nine teachers had arrived in Iraq.' 168. The Iraqi Government also, in September, asked His Majesty’s Govern ment to assist in recruiting a teacher for employment in the Technical School of Bagdad. A candidate was recommended to the Iraqi Government for this purpose m November, and by the end of the year he had been accepted by them. 169. At the end of December the number of British officials employed in the Iraq State Kailways was fifty, and of those employed in the Port Directorate at Basra, ninety. Insurance Companies Law. 170. By the end of the year the amendments to the law of 1936, which were desired principally so that the position of Lloyd’s thereunder might be regulated, had not yet been passed. It was understood that the Iraqi authorities required information with regard to the precise character of Lloyd’s and their position under insurance legislation in India, which appeared to have a bearing on the question, and attempts were being made at the end of the year to provide them with this information.Iraqi Visitors to the United Kingdom. 171. In February and March Dr. Jamali, Director-General of Educational Instruction at the Ministry of Education, paid a five weeks’ visit to the United Kingdom as the guest of the British Council. A full programme was arrange for him, in the course of which he visited various universities and saw a number of prominent educationalists in England and Scotland. Altogether the visit was important as affording a prominent Iraqi educational authority who is largely responsible for placing Iraqi students abroad (Iraq herself has, as yet, no university), an opportunity of making himself acquainted, at first hand, with the features of British university education. British Council. 172. The British Council authorised the following grants during the financial year 1938-39 : — (1) Four English teachers for Iraqi Government schools ... (2) One bursary for an Iraqi student of English (3) Three bursaries for Iraqi technical students ... ... (4) Entrance fee and bonus for Cambridge proficiency certificate students ... ... ... ••• (5) Presentation of books to the Faculte de Droit, Bagdad (6) Presentation of prizes and textbooks for Cambridge certificate classes £ 2,200 300 900 100 100 100 Total 3,700 173. By the end of 1938 (which included the first three months of the Iraqi academic year 1938-39) the bulk of these grants had been utilised. The British Council also increased their offer of four teachers to one of five, which was grate fully accepted by the Iraqi Government. 174 Lord Lloyd, the chairman of the Council, visited Bagdad from the 18th to the 22nd March, in the course of a general tour of the Near East, to discuss with the embassy details of the Council’s programme in Iraq during 1938-39 and to make contact with local officials. It was one result of his recom mendations after this visit that the Council offered to provide the five teachers of English for the Iraqi secondary schools mentioned above, and to reimburse the Iraqi Government in respect of the teachers’ salaries and other incidental expenditure. A rabic Broadcasts. 175 The inauguration on the 3rd January of the daily British Broad- casting Corporation broadcasts in Arabic from Daventry was well advertised in the Iraqi press and followed by many listeners. Comment m the local press ranged from welcome of these broadcasts to suspicion with regard to their object while one newspaper merely regarded them as the commencement of an era of competition between two “ imperialism,” Great Britain and Italy, for the favour of the Arab world. 176. On the whole, it may be said that the broadcasts are popular in Iraq, not so much on account of items such as music or talks on domestic matters, as because of the news service which they provide. Iraqi interest is centred on political matters and there is little doubt that well-presented news and instructed comment on world affairs are the lines which will most repay development here. 177 The official Arabic news service broadcast from the Jerusalem wireless station (see paragraph 162 of last year’s report) continued throughout the year and letters received by the Palestine authorities from Iraq and Syria showed that the broadcasts had, at any rate, the beginnings of a public outside Palestine. India. Pilgrims. 178. It was recorded in paragraph 155 of the report for 1937 that the Government of India had undertaken to obtain from applicants for pilgrim passes a guarantee that thev would return to India on the completion of their pilgrimage,——• 28 and the Iraqi Government were informed of the action contemplated by the Government of India in response to their representations. However, in the absence of any action by the Government of India, the abuse of pilgrim passes by Indians, who used them merely as a pretext to enter and settle in Iraq, continued unabated, and in August the embassy again drew the attention of the Government of India to a state of affairs which gravely compromised the whole system of these passes. It was then with some concern that the embassy learnt from the Government of India that on further consideration it had been decided that it was neither desirable nor practicable to insist on intending pilgrims furnishing a guarantee for their return to India on completion of their pilgrimage. The embassy protested strongly against this change of attitude and pointed out that the refusal of the Government of India to control by any system of guarantee the authenticity of their own certificate could only create such an unfortunate impression in the mind of the Iraqi Government that the embassy was reluctant to communicate it to the Iraqi Government unless it were qualified by some assurance that the Government of India were prepared to adopt alternative measures to check the nuisances of which the Iraqi Government had complained. The embassy suggested that the Government of India mio-ht require intending pilgrims to Iraq, direct or via Iran, or to the Hejaz via Iraq to deposit 60 rupees, which would be declared forfeit if the depositor did not return to India within a reasonable period. In reply, the Government of India informed the embassy that they were investigating the feasibility of this suggestion. Smuggling of Tea. 179. In order to assist the Iraqi Government, who had complained that tea illicitly exported from India to Koweit was being imported openly into Iraq the Governments of India and Ceylon suggested that the Iraqi Government should require certification of lawful exportation from India in respect of all Indian tea imported into Iraq (see paragraph 161 of the 1937 report). Although this suggestion was communicated to them in November 1937 it was not until the following May that the Iraqi Government replied that they did not feel that such a would improve the position. They put forward as an alternative and m their opinion, a better remedy that the authorities in India should take further and stronger measures on their side to prevent the unlawful export of tea to ports of the Persian Gulf. Accordingly, m June, the Government of India issued a notification restricting the export of tea from British India to the State of Cutch to consignments covered by permits granted by the Tea Licensing Association. I he Government of India brought this decision in November to the knowledge of e ei ^kj ss y.’ which, in communicating it to the Iraqi Government, explained that, it having been ascertained that the ports of this State were the princinal centres of the illicit export of tea to the Persian Gulf, it was expected that this restriction would do much to put a stop to the traffic of which the Iraqi Govern ment had had cause to complain. A fghanistan. 180. During the year King Ghazi presented the King of Afghanistan with tour thoroughbred Arab horses. Belgium. Diplomatic Representation. ISi. In April M. Egbert Graeffe presented his credentials to Kins' Ghazi as Belgian Minister to Iraq. M Graeffe, who is also Belgian Minister to Iran will continue to reside at Tehran. ’ Egypt. Provisional Iraqi-Egyptian Commercial Agreement. t , l 82 ' f 0n $e 16th May the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed to the Lgyptian Minister in Bagdad a note embodying the terms of a provisional commercial agreement between Iraq and Egypt. The agreement accorded most- favoured-nation treatment, subject to the exceptions necessitated by the special arrangements already established between the two contracting Governments and the Governments of neighbouring territories.29 4&lt;\ Egyptian Officials. 183. In May an Egyptian irrigation official named Najib Ibrahim Beg arrived for a short stay in Iraq for the purpose of advising the Iraqi Government upon certain reservoir projects. The Minister for Foreign Affairs explained to me that this official had been offered to the Iraqi Government by the Egyptian Government in replacement of Ahmed Raghib Bey, who had come to Iraq in 1937 (see last year’s report, paragraph 171) and should have returned this year, but was unable to leave his work in Egypt. It was intended that Najib Ibrahim Beg should spend from three to five months this year and a similar period next year in Iraq. I reminded Taufiq-as-Suwaidi of the terms of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930 under which Iraq was obliged normally to employ British officials if she needed foreign technical assistance, and insisted that no permanent appointment of a non-British adviser should be made without due notice. France. 184. M. Paul Lepissier was succeeded as French Minister in Bagdad by M. Jean Lescuyer, who presented his credentials on the 26th February. 185. During the year the Iraqi Government abolished the post of Minister in Paris and left their legation there in the hands of a Charge d’Affaires. 186. French interests in Iraq are almost non-existent, and Iraqi interest in France revolves mainly around the question of Syria. As the result of an enquiry made by His Majesty’s Embassy in Paris of the Quai d’Orsay in October on the subject of the ratification of the Franco-Syrian Treaty, it was learned that the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs had broached this subject to the French Govern ment during his visit to Paris some weeks previously. According to the Quai d’Orsay, the French Government informed Taufiq-as-Suwaidi, in a very general way, of the results of a recent visit to Paris of Jamil Mardam, the Syrian Prime Minister, which had served to clear up certain “ misunderstandings ” and pave the way to an early and complete agreement. Taufiq-as-Suwaidi was apparently informed that, just as France was concerned to ensure that her policy in the Levant did not range be}^ond the territories under her authority, so she expected her attitude in that respect to be reciprocated by her neighbours—a delicate hint, perhaps, to the Iraqi Government that France would resist any active Iraqi inter vention in the affairs of Syria. Germany. General Relations. 187. The year saw, on the whole, an intensification of Germany’s efforts (see paragraph 177 of the annual report for 1937) to strengthen her relations with and improve her position in Iraq. S} r mptomatic of these efforts were an increase in the number of Germans in Iraq, a lavish display of German political propa ganda, ostensible sympathy with the Arab cause in Palestine, and a keen endeavour to secure orders for German trade. 188. In September a detachment of Iraqi secondary school cadets visited Germany, at the invitation of the German Government, to take part in the Hitler Youth rally at Nuremberg; while, earlier in the year, the Iraqi Director-General of Educational Instruction paid a visit to Germany to see German educational institutions. No very remarkable results appear to have ensued from these visits. The Director of Protocol in the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs, on the other hand, returned from a trip to Germany much impressed by national socialism and by the lavish hospitality accorded to him while he was in that country. 189. Towards the end of the year the German Government loaned to the Iraqi Government for propaganda purposes the film of the 1936 Olympic Games. 190. Although, during the Central European crisis of September, the attitude of the Iraqi Government was eminently satisfactory the settlement of the Czecho-Slovak question reached at Munich undoubtedly enhanced Germany’s reputation in this country. The Iraqi press contrasted German “ achievement ” in this matter with Arab ‘ ‘ failure ’ ’ in regard to Palestine, and concluded that in this world only the strong could obtain just treatment.191. The determination of the Iraqi Government during the crisis to imple ment the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance was naturally not to the liking of the German Minister in Bagdad, Dr. Grobba, who proceeded, during the last three months of the year, to foster various influences, for example, in the army, which were suspected as being anti-governmental and pro-German; so much so that shortly before the fall of the Madfai Cabinet, Taufiq-as Suwaidi told me he was convinced that Dr. Grobba was trying to overthrow the Government! It is doubt ful, however, whether Nuri Said’s new Cabinet will be much more to Dr. Grobba’s liking than its predecessor. Press. 192. Investigation into the various wireless news services received in Iraq has shown that the German “Transocean” service is more popular with the local press than the corresponding British services available. It is preferred to Reuter’s because it is both clearer and cheaper, and to British Official Wireless Nev s because it is longer, gives more “ world ” news, and is regarded generally as being more interesting. For various reasons this state of affairs is not as harmful as it might be, and, moreover, at the end of the year the possibility was being explored of providing Iraq with additional Reuters’ services on more favourable terms. 193. A permanent branch of the Deutches Nachrichten-Biiro was set up in Iraq early in the year. A ustro-Jewish Doctors. 194. During 1938 the Iraqi Government engaged a few Austro-Jewish doctors for service in hospitals in Iraq. It is understood that the German Minister represented to the Iraqi (government the unfavourable impression that might be caused in Berlin by this action, owing to the fact that the doctors mndit carry on anti-German propaganda, but that he was assured that the doctors had behaved correctly and had taken no part in politics. Iraqi Representation. 195. During the year the Amir Zaid was withdrawn as Iraqi Minister in Berlin and the legation was left in the hands of a Charge d Affaires. Hungary. Treaty Relations. 196. On the 2nd November a Treaty of Friendship between Iraq and Hungary was signed at Angora. Article 2 of this treaty provided, inter alia, for most-favoured-nation treatment for each party’s diplomatic representatives in the territory of the other. Before the conclusion of the treaty, the embassy had mentioned this article to the legal adviser to the Mnmstry for Foreign Affairs who subsequently replied that he had advised the Minister that, in order to avoid conflict between the proposed treaty and existing Iraqi commitments to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom it was most desirable that the Iraqi Government should, in some appropriate manner, inform the Hunoarian Government of the position of His Majesty’s Ambassador under the Treaty of Alliance of 1930 whereby he was accorded permanent precedence in relation to the representatives of other Powers. Taufiq-as-Suwaidi, however, showed the greatest reluctance to do anything of this kind, and maintained that,’as there was no reasonable possibility of Hungary wishing to appoint an ambassador it would be unnecessary and invidious to invite her to take special note of the privileges of the British representative. 1 197. The Foreign Office, on being apprised of the circumstances, stated that His Majesty’s Government must insist that the Iraqi Government fulfil their treaty obligation in respect of the status of His Majesty’s Ambassador but that it was for the Iraqi Government to decide what methods to adopt’for that purpose. They could, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, either arrange for it to be placed on record whenever they concluded a treaty of the kind contemplated with Hungary, that if the other party to the treaty sent an ambassador to Bagdad he must rank after His Majesty’s Ambassador,' or, if any Power with which Iraq had no treaty containing' such a stipulation desired to31 send an ambassador to Bagdad, the Iraqi Government would refuse to receive him unless they could arrange for his Government to recognise the special position of His Majesty’s Ambassador. 198. His Majesty’s Government considered it unnecessary for any action ^ 0b to be taken in this connexion in regard to the treaty with Hungary, but their views were explained informally to Mr. McDougall. Iran. General Relations. 199. Generally speaking, relations between Iraq and Iran, although they may be said to have improved, are not yet characterised by any great confidence. The Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, for instance, mentioned to me in June information (which was subsequently confirmed by His Majesty’s Charge d'Affaii •es at Tehran) regarding new armament orders given by Iran to Czecho slovakia; this information, Taufiq-as-Suwaidi said, had caused some alarm to the Iraqi General Staff and had increased their desire to strengthen their own artillery without delay. As regards general relations, Taufiq-as-Suwaidi thought that these had recently improved, but that feelings of real confidence and sympathy had not yet been established. He thought, however, that the Shah had recently given orders that care should be taken to avoid difficulties developing between the two countries. 200. Another symptom of the uneasiness in the relations between the two countries was manifested when, later in the year, the Iraqi Government made enquiries of the embassy with regard to the large Iranian colony existing in Koweit. Frontier Question. 201. Little progress was made during the year in the matter of the conven tion for the conservancy and navigation of the Shatt-al-Arah which, under article 5 of the treaty and article 2 of the protocol attached thereto regarding the Iraq-Iranian frontier, signed on the 4th June, 1937, was to be concluded by the two parties in the course of one year from the entry into force of the treaty. It will be recalled that the position at the end of 1937 was (see para graph 188 of last year’s report) that the Iraqi Government had instructed their Minister at Tehran to endeavour to obtain the agreement of the Iranian Govern ment to an exchange of notes (to be ratified with the treaty itself) providing that, in all circumstances, the existing services of the Shatt (for which under the status quo the Iraqi Government are responsible) should be maintained until the convention came into force. According to the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, the only result of this proposal to the Iranian Government was that the latter complained to Turkey and Afghanistan of the Iraqi Government’s attitude, accusing them of intransigence, and both the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Afghan Ambassador to Turkey spoke to the Iraqi Minister at Angora urging a change of heart. Taufiq-as-Suwaidi accordingly instructed the Iraqi Minister at Angora to explain the Iraqi point of view to the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs and to suggest to him that, if no written assurances could be obtained from the Iranian Government, a representa tive of Iran should give verbal assurances to one of Iraq in the sense desired, in the presence of a Turkish representative, in order that the promises might be more trustworthy and that, if necessary, Turkish support could be invoked to persuade the Iranians to keep their word. To this the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, apparently, responded deprecating any future bargaining by Iraq about the Frontier Treaty before ratification and strongly advising the Iraqi Government to ratify it. (It should be explained that Taufiq-as- Suwaidi had told the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs in November 1937 that the Iraqi Government wished, if possible, to negotiate the Shatt-al-Arab convention before the Frontier Treaty came before Parliament, as he feared that, if this was not done, difficulties might be made about the ratification of the treaty.) The Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs promised the good offices of his Government to help in the solution of any difficulties which might later on arise concerning the Shatt-al-Arab Convention or article 2 of the protocol to the treaty.32 202. Taufiq-as-Suwaidi told His Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires that, in view of this promise, he had decided to ratify the treaty. He would, however, have the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs informed that as a result of falling in with the Turkish suggestion, the Iraqi Government considered that Turkey was bound to ensure that Iraq got fair play from Iran. 203. There was, in fact, a certain opposition to ratification of the treaty on the part of Iraqi public opinion, particularly among the Senate and the army, and it seemed likely that the Cabinet might find itself in difficulties over this question. The ratification of the treaty, when it came before the Chamber in March, was, in the event, approved by eighty-one votes to ten (see paragraph 17 above). Opposition was, however, forceful and students demonstrated outside the Chamber during the debate. Ratifications of the treaty were finally exchanged on the 20th June, 1938. 204. Under article 3 of this treaty a special commission was to be appointed by the two parties for the purpose of demarcating the frontier. Preparations for the formation of this commission were at once begun, and at the end of the year the commission were, it is understood, almost on the point of being ready to start the work of demarcation. 205. The question of the conclusion of the Shatt-al-Arab Convention was more or less dormant at the end of the year, the Iranian Government making no more and the Iraqi Government being content to let matters rest for the time being, at any rate so long as the status quo in the Shatt was preserved. Other Treaties. 208. Ratifications of the Treaty of Friendship of the 18th July, 1937, and the Treaty for the Pacific Settlement of Disputes of the 23rd July, 1937 (see paragraphs 193-194 of last year’s report), were exchanged on the 20th June, 1938. New Iranian Minister. 207. During the year M. Mousa Noury-Esfandiari was appointed Iranian Minister at Bagdad in succession to M. Muzaffar Aalam, and presented his credentials on the 5th September. M. Noury-Esfandiari had previously been, in succession, head of the Consular Department in the Iranian Ministry for Foreign Affairs, head of the Department of Industry and Mines, and Director-General of the Administrative Division of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. A ir Service. 208. On the 15th March a weekly air mail service was inaugurated between Tehran, Kermanshah and Bagdad by the Iranian State Airlines. The aircraft carry four passengers (in addition to freight and mails) once weekly in each direction. They provide connexion with Imperial Airways’ east- and west-bound services at Lake Habbaniya. Italy. Recognition of the Italian Position in Ethiopia. 209. In company with other Governments, the Iraqi Government were informed in advance of the procedure which Flis Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom proposed to adopt in order to clear up the anomalous situation arising from the fact that some members of the League of Nations had taken action which amounted to formal recognition of the fact that the Italian Govern ment exercised sovereignty over Ethiopia, while others had refrained from doino- so. The procedure proposed was that the matter should be handled by the Council of the League at its meeting in May. The Iraqi Government raised no objection to this proposal, the adoption of which resulted in the President of the Council expressing the opinion of its members that it was for each particular member of the League to deteimme its attitude in the light of its own situation and obligations. 210. On the 16th November the Anglo-Italian Agreement of the 16th April 1938, was bi ought into force, and His Majesty s Ambassador at Rome com municated to the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs new letters of credence33 accrediting him to the King of Italy, Emperor of Ethiopia. At about the same time the Iraqi Government likewise instructed their representative in Rome to signify to the Italian Government recognition by Iraq of Italian sovereignty over Ethiopia. ^ Purchase of A eroylanes, &amp;c. 211. At the end of February the Minister for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty’s representative that the “ Breda ” aircraft ordered from Italy (see paragraphs 131-133 and 205-209 of last year’s report) would shortly begin to arrive, and that three Italian civilian mechanics (one armourer, one fitter and one rigger) would accompany them. (The actual position regarding the arrival of Italian aircraft and staff in Iraq is recorded in paragraphs 322-324 below.) Taufiq-as-Suwaidi stated that it was intended that these men should be engaged for two years. As this was a much longer period than had originally been fore seen, the embassy consulted the inspector of the Royal Iraqi Air Force, who expressed the opinion that one year’s contract for the armourer and three months’ contract for the fitter and rigger in each case would be reasonable, and undertook to press this suggestion on the Officer Commanding the Iraqi air force. Under instructions from the Foreign Office, I spoke to Taufiq-as-Suwaidi on the subject at the end of April and, on learning from him that it had been decided to offer one year’s contract to all the Italian mechanics, expressed regret that Wing Commander Gulley’s suggestions had not been followed, and said that His Majesty’s Government attached great importance to an early return to the position in which the Iraqi Government had none but British advisers and employees in military matters. I expressed the hope that there would be no suggestion of extending the men’s contracts before the end of the first year. The Minister replied that he thought this was unlikely. 212. The position, however, was not improved by a proposal on the part of the Ministry of Defence, towards the end of the year, to send a number of Iraqi “ other ranks ” personnel to Italy for training in the maintenance of the Italian aircraft. Major-General Waterhouse and I both protested to the Iraqi Govern ment against this proposal, pointing out that there were British non-commissioned officers available who could easily master the details of the maintenance of the Italian aircraft in a short time; and I informed Taufiq-as-Suwaidi that the proposal would be a direct breach of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance. Never theless, the Iraqi Government persisted in the proposal, and at the end of the year the matter had been referred to the Foreign Office for instructions. Banco di Roma. 213. A branch of the Banco di Roma was opened in Bagdad on the 3rd January. Koweit and the Gulf States. General Relations. 214. Relations between Iraq and Koweit continued, during the year, to be uneasy. On the Iraqi side there were the usual complaints regarding smuggling into Iraq from Koweit; the desire for an Iraqi port in Koweit Bay and for an extension of the Bagdad—Basra Railway to Koweit in order to provide Iraq with an outlet on the Persian Gulf; and even a disposition to question Koweit s international status—while on the Koweiti side a further incursion by Iraqi police into Koweit, during the summer, was alleged, and complaint was made of the attitude of the Iraqi press. 215. During his visit to Europe in the autumn, the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs made plain to His Majesty’s Government the attitude of his Government with regard to Koweit. In an aide-memoire handed, to the Parlia mentary Under-Secretary of State on the 29th August at Geneva, Taufiq-as- Suwaidi explained that in the Iraqi view Koweit not only had become an entrepot for extensive arms traffic and smuggling, but barred Iraq s access to the open sea. Before the war, he stated, Koweit was an autonomous qadha of the Vilayat of Basra; and the Iraqi Government considered that, as the successor of the Turkish Government in that vilayat, Koweit should properly be incorporated in Iraq. Should this occur, the two above-mentioned problems would, he said, be automa-tically solved; otherwise, other means must be found. So far as the smuggling and arms traffic was concerned, Taufiq-as-Suwaidi suggested three possible courses, in order of effectiveness: — {a) A customs union between Iraq and Koweit, Koweit to receive a fixed annual sum in lieu of its present customs revenue. (b) The northern frontier line of Koweit to run from west to east at about latitude 29 35 , instead of about 30 c north as at present, so as to give the Iraqi preventive services more space in which to operate south of Zubair, Shaiba and other villages south of the Hammar Lake. (c) Combined preventive operations. 216. As regards direct access to the sea, Taufiq-as-Suwaidi suggested two alternative positions for a port and railway terminus :— {a) A suitable site on Koweit Bay. (b) The inland extension of the Khor Abdullah, named on the map Khor Zubair. r In the first event Iraq would require to lease from Koweit a site for the port a^nd a corridor for the railway line. In the second event a slight rectification of jL . on ^ ier wou ld, faufiq-as-Suwaidi affirmed, be necessary so as to give sufficient room at Uum Qasr (a probable site) and leave the whole of the Khor Abdullah m Iraq. 217. Taufiq-as-Suwaidi developed his proposals while in London, and they were being considered by His Majesty’s Government at the end of the year. But, so tar as the status of Koweit was concerned, he was informed by the Secretary °f State, on the 4th October, that His Majesty’s Government would hnd it very difficult to admit any Iraqi claim based on legal or historical grounds it the Iraqi Government were ever to put forward such a claim, to sovereignty over Koweit. The Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that he did not wish to insist on this point, and thought that the legal issues of the case might be entirely set aside m the discussion of the two practical points which he had raised. r^ he v .^ ws °? His . Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom with regard to Koweiti nationality were, at about the same time, made plain to the fraqi Government in another connexion. These views were that the Sheikhdom ot Aoweit was for a considerable period in an anomalous state of semi-dependence on the Ottoman Empire; that His Majesty’s Government had nevertheless been m treaty relations with the Sheikhs of Koweit since 1841; and that Koweit finally became completely independent of Turkey and Koweiti nationality finally came into existence on the same date as Iraq and Iraqi nationality. Nationality Law. 2 19 . During the year the embassy continued to press the Iraqi Government tor the release of certain persons of exclusively Bahraini nationality who had been called up by the Iraqi Government for military service. 'As stated in paragraph 222 of last year’s report, the Iraqi attitude appeared to be that Bahrain was not finally detached from the Ottoman Empire until the date of the ratification of the Treaty of Lausanne, and that, in consequence, its inhabitants came within the scope of article 3 of the Iraqi Nationality Law, whereby former Ottoman subjects habitually resident in this country were declared to have acquired Iraqi nationality on the 6th August, 1924. At all events the Iraai Government professed inability to come to a decision on the question until thev were furnished with information regarding the inception of Bahraini nationalitv In consequence, the embassy obtained authorisation to inform the Iraqi Govern ment of His Majesty’s Government’s views on this matter, namely that His Majesty’s Government had consistently dealt with the sheikhdom of Bahrain as an independent State for the past 130 years; that they had been in treaty relations with the Sheikhs of Bahrain since 1820; and that, without prejudice to the position before that date, His Majesty’s Government regarded Bahrain as having been an independent State at least since then. At the end of the year the embassy was still pressing the Iraqi Government to accept the British view of the international position, or at any rate to state what criterion they adopted in arriving at the conclusion that the conscripted men were liable to military service in Iraq. J35 The Properties of the Sheikh of Koweit in Iraq. 220. The case brought against the Sheikh of Koweit concerning the validity of his title to the Faddaghiyah estate in Iraq was heard in the Basra courts in June. A well-known Egyptian lawyer was briefed to direct the defence on behalf of the sheikh. Unfortunately, judgment was given against the sheikh whose lawyers thereupon appealed. The appeal had not been heard before the end of the year, and as the Appeal Court is likely to uphold the judgment of the court of first instance, it is to be hoped that, in the manner indicated in the following paragraph, it may be possible to have the whole question of the sheikh’s titles to his properties in Iraq transferred to the Land Settlement Court before a final judgment is given. 221. At the end of October, after prolonged discussions, the Iraqi Govern ment accepted the proposal which His Majesty’s Government had made in July 1936, that the Land Settlement Law should be used to determine the validity of the title of the Sheikh of Koweit to his properties in Iraq. The embassy thereupon began to press for the declaration of Land Settlement in the districts of Fao and Siba, where these properties are situated. The year ended, however, without the required declaration having been made. 222. In April the local authorities in Fao, acting on behalf of the Basra Port, cut down about 100 date trees on one of the properties of the Sheikh of Koweit without his Highness’s permission. Representations were made by the embassy to the Iraqi Government, with the result that in November an under taking was obtained that the damage caused would be assessed by a special com mittee and appropriate compensation paid by the port authorities. League of Nations. Iraqi Delegation at Geneva. 223. In February the Iraqi permanent delegate at Geneva informed the Secretary-General of the League of Nations of the Iraqi Government’s decision to close on the 15th March, for administrative reasons, the offices of the permanent Iraqi delegation at Geneva, and to depute in future temporary delegations as and when they might be necessary. Saudi Arabia. General Relations. 224. The new Iraqi Charge d’Affaires, Saiyid Thabit Abdul Nur, on his arrival at Jedda early in the year, proceeded to display great activity in fostering Iraqi-Saudi Arabian relations. This activity culminated in his putting forward, with the sanction of his Government, proposals to the Saudi Arabian Government for— (a) A military agreement to implement article 7 of the Treaty of Arab Brotherhood and Alliance of 1936; {b) The unification of the currencies of Saudi Arabia and Iraq; and (c) An arrangement whereby any country importing goods into Saudi Arabia should buy from the latter produce up to 20 per cent, or 30 per cent, of the value of such goods or, if such produce was not available in Saudi Arabia, then from Iraq, who would pay Saudi Arabia a commission of 10 per cent, or 15 per cent, in sales thus effected. 225. By the end of the year, however, there was no evidence that these schemes had come to fruition. The Iraqis’ initiative in these matters was in marked contrast to their unhelpful attitude in day to day matters on the frontier, such as the raiding of Nejdi tribesmen’s camels by Iraqi tribesmen, where the Saudi authorities’ attempts to settle the matter according to tribal custom have encountered persistent resistance from the Iraqi side. Frontier Demarcation. 226. By notes dated the 7th February and the 2nd March respectively, the Iraqi and Saudi Arabian Governments agreed to certain arrangements for the demarcation of their common frontier. These arrangements consisted, in essence, of the provision of a network of triangulation along the frontier zone, followed3G by a topographical survey of a zone extending to a depth of 5 kilom. along each side of the frontier and the erection of boundary pillars. Work was begun at the eastern end of the frontier, but had not progressed far west before the summer heat put an end to it. Operations were resumed at the beginning of October, and towards the end of the year triangulation had been completed as far as Jumaima. Frontier A greements. 227. On the 19th May the Iraqi and Saudi Arabian Governments concluded agreements dealing with the control of the Neutral Zone, tribal grazing and watering rights, and the nationality of border tribes Representation. 228. During the year the Saudi Arabian Charge d’Affaires was replaced by a Minister, Sheikh Hamza Ghauth, who presented his credentials to Kino- Ghazi on the 12th October. Syria. Franco-Syrian Treaty. 229. In the course of his visit to London (see paragraph 138 above) the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed to the Secretary of State his perturbation at the delay in the ratification of the Franco-Syrian Treaty, and asked that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom shoud use their influence with the French Government in favour of the early ratification of that treaty and against the setting up of any special regime in the Upper Jezireh. Lord Halifax replied that His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to bring to the notice of the French Government the anxiety which Taufiq-as- Suwaidi had expressed, more especially as regards the position in the Jezireh, and to ask for any information which the French Government could give them as to the progress of negotiations. Instructions in this sense were sent to His Majesty’s representative at Paris during October. 230. The embassy in Paris duly approached the Quai d’Orsay on the subject, when the latter informed them that the French view had been explained to Taufiq-as-Suwaidi during his visit to Europe, as described in paraoraph 186 above. &amp; F Palestine. 231. The Syrian Government and press continued to demonstrate their support of Iraq in her espousal of the Arab cause in Palestine, and the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs was given a warm welcome during his passage through Syria both before and after his visit to Europe in the autumn. Tribal Incidents. 232. In October trouble arose between the Shammar tribe of Iraq and the Agaidat of Syria. The first incident occurred at the salt lake of Buwara through which the Iraqi-Synan frontier runs; the headman of the Shammar posted guards on the salt lake and demanded a fee from an Agaidat tribal salt caravan seizing some of their animals. This incident was followed by further raids by the Shammar on the Agaidat, and at least one retaliatory action by the latter but by the end of the year the Iraqi and Syrian authorities had concerted with a view to settling the dispute. Turkey. Sanjak of A lexandretta. 233 When in May the result of the communal registration held under the Organic Statute and Fundamental Law adopted by the Council of the League of Nations on the 29th May, 1937, made it plain that, although the “ Arab ” element was m the majority, the Turks were determined to secure their ends by other means, the Minister for Foreign Affairs made a strong appeal to me that His Majesty s Government m the United Kingdom should use their influence with a view to inducing the Turkish Government to moderate their attitude And in June, when it became apparent that the French and Turkish Governments were likely to reach a bilateral agreement which would practically hand over thesanjak to Turkey without any reference to the League of Nations, opinion in Iraq generally was aroused, and articles appeared in the press criticising His Majesty s Government for their acquiescence in what was held to be a betrayal of the Arabs. The Minister for Foreign Affairs again spoke to me strongly on the subject; he said that the attitude of His Majesty's Government on this question was incom prehensible to people in Iraq, and that it looked to many as if Great Britain were abandoning her old friendship with the Arabs in favour of a rapprochement with the Turks. He contrasted the ease with which Turkey had obtained from His Majesty’s Government a credit of £6 million with the difficulties experienced by Iraq in obtaining his own modest requirements of armaments. If the Turks were allowed to have their own way in the sanjak there was no knowing but that their next claim would be based on the Turkish minorities in the Mosul vilayet. Taufiq-as-Suwaidi said that His Majesty’s Government ought to use their influence to bring about an honest plebiscite to be followed by frontier adjust ments which would leave the Turks in Turkey and the Arabs in Syria. Under such an arrangement he was prepared to see Alexandretta itself go to the Turks, for he was convinced that the Statute of Alexandretta as drawn up at Geneva would be a source of endless trouble and would be exploited by the Turks as a basis for further demands. A week or two later the Minister for Foreign Affairs told me that the Turkish Minister had informed him that, provided Antioch as well as Alexandretta were given to Turkey, the Turkish Government would be prepared to settle the sanjak question by partition between Syria and Turkey. To this the Minister for Foreign Affairs had replied that he could not support any Turkish demand for Antioch which, if adopted, would mean Turkey acquiring the most fertile part of the sanjak and only desert being left for Syria. 234. Having reported the Minister for Foreign Affairs' views and suggestions to the Foreign Office, I was instructed at the end of June to inform him that the Iraqi Minister in London had called at the Foreign Office on the 17th June and had been told that, although the Turkish Government had declared their wish that the Geneva arrangements for the autonomy of the sanjak should be carried out, the French Government were convinced that the only Government which could maintain itself would be one in which the Turkish element had the preponderant role. As a member of the League of Nations, His Majesty s Government were concerned that there should be adequate safeguards for the minorities. I also told the Minister for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty’s Government sympathised with Iraqi interest in the question and understood the reasons which had led Taufiq-as-Suwaidi to make certain enquiries and suggestions. His Majesty’s Government had, however, no locus standi to intervene save as a member of a committee appointed by the Council of the League. It was thus not open to them to suggest a decision, such as partition, on lines different from those approved by that committee. As for His Majesty’s Government’s attitude towards Turkey, British friendship with Turkey was based on recognition of Turkey’s position as a stabilising element in the Mediterranean and the Balkans. His Majesty’s Government were fully alive to the need for preserving their traditional friendship with the Arabs. There would be no comparison between the credits granted to Turkey and the supply of specific arms, &amp;c., to Iraq. Finally, in His Majesty’s Government’s opinion, Turkey would continue to regard herself as a territorially sated Power for some time to come, provided the settlement of the sanjak dispute did not leave her with a sense of grievance. 235. The Minister for Foreign Affairs did not seem to derive much comfort from this message, and maintained with vigour that what the Turks really wanted was Antioch. However, he said that Iraq and Syria would agree even to that, though neither wished to see such a solution, for the Arabs would regard partition even with the loss of Antioch as preferable to the indeterminate solution evolved at Geneva. 236. The conclusion of the Franco-Turkish understanding on the subject of the sanjak much irritated the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who maintained that it had robbed the Iraqi Government of all chance of arranging a settlement on the basis of partition. His Excellency told me that Dr. Aras, the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, had, on*about the 8th July, sent for the Iraqi Minister and told him that the Turkish General Staff was opposed to partition and that no further representations from the Iraqi Government on this point could be considered. Taufiq-as-Suwaidi was convinced that the French policy38 was deliberately to maintain an uncertain situation in Syria, and that the Turks, not to be satisfied with what they had got in the sanjak, were already beginning to covet Aleppo. 237. On the 2nd August His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires was instructed to inform the Minister for Foreign Affairs that, while His Majesty’s Government would bear in mind the views expressed by him on the subject, they felt sure that he would appreciate that, Turkey on the one hand and France representing the Syrian Arabs on the other having reached an agreement, it would be difficult for His Majesty’s Government to intervene with some entirely new solution. In principle His Majesty’s Government welcomed the fact that Turkey and France had been able to agree, and they would be reluctant to take any step which might reopen the dispute. There was, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government &amp; no hope that the Turks would abandon their claims to Antioch, but Turkey would loyally adhere to her agreement with France. i. ^ or -^ ore ig n Affairs was not consoled by this message and said that he had handed to the Turkish Minister a letter setting forth the further views of the Iraqi Government. A translation of this document was forwarded to the Foreign Office, and shortly afterwards a written appeal from the Ministry tor Foreign Affairs for His Majesty’s Government’s intervention reached the embassy. r P 9 ' ^ ^ ms . ter for Foreign Affairs then proceeded to Geneva and London and while in Europe reached a decision to leave the question of Alexandretta on one side for the time being. However, his Excellency, when visiting the Foreign Office, did express the hope that His Majesty’s Government would be able to support at some suitable moment in the future a proposal for a new settlement on the basis of a partition of the sanjak between Turkey and byna. He was told that His Majesty’s Government, for their part would not see any objection to such a proposal provided it was acceptable to Turkey and France as the parties chiefly concerned. j d a United States of A merica. Treaty Relations. 240. Negotiations which had been pursued during the year for the conclu- sion of a commercial treaty between the United States of'America and Iraq culminated on the 3rd December in the signature in Bagdad of a Treaty of Commerce and Navigation on broad most-favoured-nation principles It was considered probable that this treaty would be followed up by the negotiation of a special trade agreement between the two States, in the course of which increased facilities for the import of Iraqi dates into the United States of America would be asked for by the Iraqi Government. Palestine. 241. Some press agitation against the United States developed in Iraq towards the end of the year on account of what was alleged to be sympathy on the part of the United States Administration with Zionism.

Royal Air Force. Command. 246. On the 20th September, 1938, Air Vice-Marshal J. H. S. Tyssen, M.C. 1 ' ° ver command of the British forces in Iraq from Air Vice-Marshal C. L. Courtney, C.B., C.B.E., D.S.O. Strength. 247. Although the number of fighting units in the command has remained uncnanged, their disposition has been altered as a result of the occupation of the new cantonment at Habbaniya. 248. I he distribution of units at the end of the period under review was as follows : — Habbaniya— iMo. 30 (B.) Squadron. No. 55 (B.) Squadron. No. 70 (B.T.) Squadron. ^o. 1 Armoured Car Company (less one section). Shaiba— No. 84 (B.) Squadron. One section of No. 1 Armoured Car Company. Basra— No. 203 (G.R.) Squadron. Re-equipment. 249. The re-equipment of No. 30 (B.) Squadron with Blenheim aircraft has continued throughout the year, and the last of twelve initial equipment and ten reserve aircraft was collected from Aboukir during October. Air Headquarters were subsequently notified that aircraft to bring the reserve up to twenty-four Blenheim aircraft would be shipped to Basra in the summer of 1939 „ m 250 o. ^formation was received from Air Ministry that the re-equinment v«nd Shi ve:™; B/r'B «t 'fiiy Dhihban (Habbaniya). 251. The transfer of units to the new cantonment at Dbihhan * j by the 10th January, 1938, and the handing over of the Hinaidi cantonment tothe Iraqi Government was completed by the 17th January, 1938. 11 tn changed from mibL^Vafba’nlJr 81 ' 6 ° f ^ Cant0nmeilt WaS offidalI y Landing Grounds in Iraq. 253.

Three flying boats of No. 203 (G.R.) Squadron were based at Bahrein, Khor Jarama, and Ras-al-Khaimah to act as safety aircraft for the crossing of the Persian Gulf by the three long range Wellesley aircraft on their record flight from Ismailia to Port Darwin. Inter-Command Flights. 256. The Singapore Reinforcement Scheme was again practised in January 1938, when nine Valentia aircraft of No. 70 (B.T.) Squadron, fifteen Vincent aircraft of No. 84 (B.) Squadron, and four Singapore flying boats of No. 203 (G.R.) Squadron flew to Singapore and there took part in combined defence exercises with the Royal Navy. 257. Twelve Vincents of No. 55 (B.) Squadron left Habbaniya on the 7th August and proceeded along the Arabian coast to Aden, where they arrived on the 31st August. On the 7th September these aircraft left Aden for Port Sudan, Khartum. Luxor and finally Heliopolis, which they reached on the 26th September. The squadron returned to Iraq from Heliopolis on the 7th October. 258. On the 5th September four Vincents of No. 84 (B.) Squadron left Shaiba and proceeded via Habbaniya to Heliopolis, whence they carried out flights to several stations within the Middle East Command. On the 6th October the flight left Heliopolis, and returned to Shaiba via Habbaniya. 259. Twelve Blenheim aircraft of No. 30 (B.) Squadron were detailed to proceed to Egypt on the 30th September. During their stay at Heliopolis, these aircraft continued with squadron training, and finally were ordered to return to Habbaniya on the 10th October. 260. Four Blenheim aircraft of No. 30 (B.) Squadron are at present carrying out a flight to Aden via Egypt and the Sudan. These aircraft left Habbaniya on the 25th November and arrived at Nairobi on the 2nd December. On the 6th December they left Nairobi and proceeded to Khartum. From Khartum they proceeded to Aden, and returned to Habbaniya before the end of the year. 261. Aircraft of Nos 30, 55, 70 and 84 Squadrons have periodically carried out flights to Egypt during the year in the course of service training. Liaison Flights to Syria. 262. Courtesy visits have been exchanged by the Royal Air Force in Iraq and the French air force in Syria; on five occasions French aircraft have visited Iraq, and on seven occasions aircraft of the Royal Air Force have pioceeded to Syria. 263. One French aircraft attended the inauguration ceremony of the Basra airport. It is intended to send three Blenheim aircraft to Syria on the occasion of the opening of the new Beirut airport, and it is anticipated that this flight will be accompanied by the Air Officer Commanding. Summer Training Camp. 264. The summer training camp at Ser Amadia was again opened on the 13th June, 1938. The twelve parties visiting the camp were flown to bimel as in previous years, and thence were conveyed to the training camp by road T e camp was closed on the 12th September, 1938, after o3 officers, 14 sisters of Princess Mary’s Royal Air Force Nursing Service and 516 airmen had visited it. A ir Liaison Officers. 265. The post of air liaison officer at Bahrein, which became vacant with the death of Wing Commander A. R. M. Rickards O.B_E. was filled on the 29th March, 1938, by Flight Lieutenant (Acting Squadron Leader) K. K. Coates, who arrived in the Iraq Command on the 12th April, 1938. 266. Air liaison officers have been maintained at Mosul, Bagdad, Sulaimam, Basra and Bahrein.44 Surveys. 267. Survey work within the limits Nukhaib, Machmi Well, Lussuf, Tuqtagana and Shithatha has been carried out during the year, but this work was to a certain extent delayed by extensive floods and by the international situation in September 1938. Armoured Cars. 268. During the past year normal training exercises have been undertaken, in the course of which most parts of the country have been visited. On two occasions a half-section proceeded to Amman on convoy duties. Advantage was taken of a visit to Koweit to carry out a combined exercise with the sheikh’s local armed cars and guards. Y a ! ua ble experience in co-operation with semi regular forces was obtained, and it is intended to repeat these combined exercises during routine visits. 269 During the emergency the armoured cars were responsible for guiding ^ P rot ® cfcm f the ground echelon convoys of squadrons across the desert to the Transjordan frontier. They prove extremely valuable in this connexion, and excellent training was obtained. ’ Visits.

An Imperial Airways rest-house is being constructed at Lake Habbaniya. Iraq Levies. Organisation and Establishment. 278. The present location of the Iraq Levies is as follows : — Habbaniya— Nos. 1 to 4 (Assyrian) Companies. No. 5 (Arab) Company. No. 8 (Kurdish) Company. Makina— No. 6 (Arab) Company. Shaiba— No. 7 (Arab) Company. 279. No. 1 (Assyrian) Company was located at Ser Amadia for guard duties during the period of the summer training camp, and when the camp was closed the company returned to Habbaniya. Training. 280. Normal training has been carried out during the year. In the spring all companies at Habbaniya went into camp for a fortnight to carry out company and inter-company exercises. 281. Each company has now been reorganised into three similar “rifle’' platoons, each containing two rifle sections and one Lewis gun section. Each company has also a support platoon consisting of one section of Vickers machine o-uns and a mortar detachment. This reorganisation has simplified training and made companies more self-contained. All companies have been trained on this organisation during the summer. 282. Excellent practical training was experienced during the emergency period as the levies had to guard and maintain certain desert staging posts. Also, owing to the various labour troubles in the Habbaniya cantonment, considerable experience in internal security duties has been obtained. Iraqi Army. General. 283 The year 1938 was for the most part one of steady if slow, P^gress in expansion and organisation, and promised to be free from the storms of 1936 and 1937- but at Christmas it was marred by anothei incursion of the ar } to politics, the result of which can only be to shake confidence and breed ill-feeling and suspicion in the army. 284 Under the firm leadership of the Chief of the General fetaff, Husain Fawzi who enioyed the support of Jamil-al-Madfai, political intrigue among t le officers appeared to have been reduced, and more attention was given to training, while for the first time a really serious attempt was made to oiganise some of the administrative services. 285 At the end of October a Cabinet reshuffle gave the portfolio of Defence to Sabih Najib, who after twenty years in the Turkish ^ Ira ^ ^ snent the last seven years in various civil governmental appointments. A man of wide views, he embarked on a policy of drastic retre g hl 'g‘ of finding extra funds for equipment, and more especiaily of building up a force somewhat on the lines originally suggested by the late unpopular and his interference with promotions a f nd , Jfi also his economies') brought to a head a latent discontent amon the offleeis H aiso ms economies; uiuu^ h December was Al Amid successor, as a result o± tne coup a niai ui me46 (Lieutenant-General) Taha-al-Hashimi. Taha had been Chief of the General Staff for seven years until 1936, when he was placed on the retired list as a result of Bekr Sidqi’s coup d’Etat. An able administrator, with a tremendous capacity for work, he had been responsible for the growth of the Iraqi army from a few battalions and regiments to a strength of nearly two divisions. 286. The army was not called upon during the year to undertake any fighting in aid of the civil power, though a force of about one infantry brigade with two batteries was concentrated on the upper reaches of the Lesser Zab in the summer and autumn. This demonstration helped to persuade the Pizhder Aghas to accept peacefully the administrative control of the Iraqi Government (see paragraph 44 above). 287. At the time of the international crisis in the autumn the Ministry of Defence readily made arrangements to give full effect to the obligations of the Iraqi Government under article 4 of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance of 1930 Guards were posted on the principal bridges and other main points on the line of communication between the Persian Gulf and the air-base at Habbaniya, and willing help was given to the Air Staff in planning the requisitioning of ’civil transport to meet the possible requirements of His Majesty’s Government As a result of these developments steps are being taken to consider in detail the total available mechanical transport in the country and its allotment in time of war to meet the needs of the Iraqi army, the Royal Air Force and the economic life National Service. 288. The application of conscription was continued with less general resistance from the tribes, and a more steady flow of recruits was maintained a total of over 14,000 passing through the depots. This improvement was partly ffi 6 Rec ™l tmg De P a T rtm 1 ent bein g Placed under the control of one of the a lest officers of the army. In the past recruiting has been in the hands of officers who were unemployable elsewhere, and steps have been taken to replace these inefficient officers by more energetic ones.

The following new units were formed in the course of the year:— Three field batteries (18-pounders). One 6-inch howitzer battery (by expansion of the existing section). Three infantry battalions (for the 9th Infantry Brigade). One tank company (armed with Italian light tanks). One depot company, M.T. 295. The headquarters of the 3rd Division was formed in November, and this division, which is to be located between Qaraghan and Bagdad, has been allotted the 1st Infantry Brigade and the 5th Field Artillery Brigade from the 1st Division and the new 9th Infantry Brigade. Its 3rd Infantry Brigade and the remainder of the artillery have yet to be formed. A nucleus of signals and M.T. units has been made available. The 1st Division was reorganised to comprise the 2nd, 3rd and 7th Infantry Brigades and the 1st Field and 4th Mountain Artillery Brigades. It is located in and between Bagdad and Basra. 296. The signal personnel for regiments, battalions and batteries was incorporated in these units, instead of being part of the signal battalions. 297. The animal transport companies were disbanded, and regiments and battalions now have their 2nd line transport animals in their own establishments. 298. Some progress has been made in drawing up war establishments. Hitherto few administrative units had been included, but a beginning has now been made. M.T. is now organised for war on the British system, with supply, baggage and ammunition companies for each division. Supply organisation is a problem, for practically none at present exists. Fortunately the feeding of the Arab soldier does not present so many difficulties as elsewhere; for his staple diet consists of stew and bread. 299. The offices of the Ministry of Defence were moved at the end of November from their old insanitary and unsatisfactory quarters to a new building (also in the citadel) on the banks of the Tigris. The building was opened by King Ghazi. Training. 300. Nothing more ambitious than brigade training was attempted, and the value of even this training was reduced owing to the absence, in practice camps, of the artillery. 301. Efforts to bring the training year more into line with modern require ments have not met with much success, although a stait has been made by planning somewhat further ahead. Infantry training generally is weak, while any real grasp of the tactical problems of modern war is woefully deficient. 302. The artillery, as usual, acquitted itself well at its annual practice camps, and, in spite of a reduction in the allotment of ammunition, due largely to uncertainty as to the international situation, progress was registered both technically and tactically. 303. The lack of any uniform tactical doctrine and the general weakness of higher training has given grave concern to the Chief of the General Staff, who initiated a series of carefully prepared training exercises without troops. The first exercise took place in December and others are to be held in 1939. Armament and Equipment. 304. In the summer an army five-year plan (part of the Government s capital works plan) to meet the needs of Iraq in the major items o f ammunition and other military supplies was submitted to and accepted by the War Office (see paragraph 144 above). 305. Ammunition demands were based on the provision of a war reserve of 1,000 rounds per gun for the artillery of three divisions, on a scale of forty-four’ ■w— 48 guns and howitzers per division. The crisis of September, and suggestions put forward from London as to the difficulties of sending further supplies after the outbreak of war, have caused this estimate to be drastically reviewed. A reserve of 2,000 rounds per gun is under consideration as the minimum that will provide safety. 306. The position regarding the supply of guns is dealt with in para- ^ graphs 143-147 above. The following ammunition was supplied during the year :— 4 • 5-inch howitzers : 500 smoke. 3-7-inch howitzers : 3,480 H.E. 6-inch howitzers: 200 H.E. German A A/AT : 36,000 rounds of each. S.A.A. : 10 million rounds (from the continent). 307. The rearmament of the infantry with Bren light machine guns, in replacement of the obsolete Lewis gun, was started (see paragraph 150 above), but progress was delayed by a shortage of pack saddlery and by the necessity of training sufficient instructors in the new weapon previous to its issue. Administrative Services. 308. The M.T. workshops were moved during the year from the citadel in Bagdad to A1 Rashid cantonment. Existing buildings have been greatly enlarged and, with the extra machinery now being installed, the maintenance of M.T. should improve still further. The great difficulty still lies in the shortage of satisfactory mechanics. 309. Two mobile repair units, equipped with workshop and breakdown lorries, have been formed. 310. The outstanding items of work completed during the year are :—■ (a) The overhauling and making serviceable of fourteen Italian light tanks which, although new, arrived in a deplorable condition. (b) The mechanisation of one 3 • 7-inch howitzer battery by the conversion of lord lorries so as to carry both guns and personnel. (c) The conversion of Scammel heavy lorries into tractors for 6-inch howitzers. {d) The increase of repair and overhaul output by 300 per cent. (e) The completion ol one armoured car and the commencement of the construction of two others. 311. The following additional mechanical transport vehicles were acquired : 250 lord 2-ton lorries (purchased in 1937 and delivered early in 1938) and fourteen other vehicles. 312. Ihe Mechanical Transport School has been expanded, and the output ot trained M.T. personnel for the year was thirty-one officers and 370 n.c.os. and men. Both individual and collective training of units has taken place during me year. output of s.a.a. from the factory in Bagdad amounted to approxi mately 9 million rounds. The construction of the rifle factory at Musayib is progressing, and machinery is being installed. It is hoped to start production ol rifles before the end of 1939. The arrangements for housing the personnel are so far totally inadequate, and this fact is certain to lead to labour difficulties later on. 314. The army now grinds its own wheat; mills for this purpose have started in Bagdad, Kirkuk and Mosul. The quality of the flour is excellent the monetary saving involved considerable A ccommodation. Barracks are under construction at Table Mountain and Qaraghan for the 3rd Division. Their walls are only one-brick thick supported by wooden framework, so that the buildings will be hot in summer and cold in winter while 1 bey cannot be expected to last long as the work is of a very low standard49 316. A1 Rashid, previously the Royal Air Force station of Hinaidi, has been much neglected, only a fraction of the sum expended annually by the Royal Air Force on maintenance being allotted for repairs there during the year. Washash, on the right bank of the Tigris, has also been sadly neglected, as the sale of this area is now under discussion with the municipal authorities. r 317. Several of the recently constructed barracks, e.g., Rowanduz and Musayib, are already in need of extensive repairs owing to the original contractors’ very bad work. All existing barracks are overcrowded, in spite of the army being under strength, and little or nothing has been done to house the officers, who seldom live in the vicinity of their lines and take little interest in the comfort or welfare of their men. Royal Iraqi Air Force. General. 318. The air force has, during the whole of 1938, been commanded by A1 Aqid (Lieutenant-Colonel) Akram Mushtaq, with considerable grace but with lack of energy, determination or strength of character. 319. Discipline has perhaps improved during the year among both officers and other ranks owing, in the case of the former, to the dismissal or transfer to the army of four officers, including the “hero” of the Mosul murders of August i937. 320. The maintenance, overhaul and repair of aircraft has been organised on a very much sounder basis, in spite of apathy and even obstruction on the part of those in command. This improvement has been due partly to the dismissal of the Iraqi technical officer, but principally to the efforts of the British staff. Aircraft. 321. Fifteen Gladiator fighter aircraft were received and put into com mission during the year. Fifteen Italian Breda fighter-bomber aircraft have been received, six erected, but only one flown. Four Savoia twin-engined bombers have been received, of which one has been used to give dual instruction. Two Iraqi pilots only have flown solo on the Breda and four on the Savoias. No ammunition or bombs for the Italian aircraft have been purchased. 322. The cost of these Italian aeroplanes (which, as stated in paragraph 206 of last year’s report, were ordered in 1937 by the late Mohammad Ali Jawad) was £11.000 per Breda and £20,000 per Savoia, the total order amounting to between £270.000 and £280,000, and including a small amount of spares and extra accessories. Of the Savoia aircraft ordered one more has yet to arrive in Iraq. 323. The Italian aeroplanes are at present maintained and flown by two civil Italian pilots and five Italian civilian mechanics, with the help of Iraqi personnel. Budget. 324. The air force budget for 1938-39 amounted to a total of I.D. 183,000 for current expenditure and I.D. 55,000 for the five-year plan, of which approxi mately I.D. 95,000 and I.D. 55,000 respectively has so far been expended, not including commitments during the last two months of the year. These sums are included in the total figures mentioned in paragraph 292 above. Organisation and Training. 325. The force is at present organised into four squadrons. Of these Nos. 1 and 3 are army co-operation squadrons, equipped with Audax, No. 2 is a com munication squadron with various types, and No. 4 is a provisional unit with one flight of Gladiators, one of Bredas and one of Savoias. T here are also a flying training school, an apprentices’ school, and an aircraft depot with repair facilities. 326. On the whole, little progress in the organisation and training of the air force has been made during the year. It is not too much to say that for any maior operations the Iraqi air force would be of little or no use. I he appoint ment of an additional Royal Air Force officer to advise on purely training matters (see paragraph 132 above) should result in improvements.wmmm 50 327. No real attempt has yet been made to enlarge the supplies organisation of the air force with a view to bringing it into line with the expansion of the force itself. Civil Aviation. 328. The exceptionally well organised and equipped airport at Basra was opened in May. This airport was built, and is entirely directed, by Sir John Ward and his very capable staff. The Director of Civil Aviation in Iraq has not been and is not concerned with this organisation in any way. 329. The airport at Bagdad is in a lamentable state. The all-weather runway has been in course of reconstruction for over five months and is still less than half finished. During the heavy rains in December it was necessary for all civil aircraft to land at the Royal Air Force aerodrome at Habbaniya, which caused inconvenience and discomfort to all concerned. The River Flotilla. 330. Four river craft (built by Thornycroft), each of about 100 tons displace ment and armed with one 3-7-inch howitzer, two 3-inch mortars and 4 Vickers machine guns, have been commissioned, with headquarters at Amara. They are at present considerably overmanned and generally overloaded, but they are well kept and the crews are smart and workmanlike. Their value in connexion with tribal disturbances has yet to be proved.9745 [16798] B T V t e &lt;_/ » (Co\J ^ 1 i-&lt;-4 !

THE outstanding event of the year was the sudden and violent end of the Administration which had come into power with the coup d’Etat of the 29th October, 1936. The murder of General Bekr Sidqi on the 11th August removed the mainstay of Hikmat Sulaiman's Government, and the demonstration of sullen hostility from the army which followed compelled their hasty resig nation. There were noteworthy points of similarity between the events of October 1936 and those of August 1937. In each the assassination of a conspicuous public figure and the disaffection of the army played a decisive and disturbing part. But both were attended by a general public calm, alike among the tribes and the people of the towns, which did much to allay the misgivings to which the crises themselves naturally gave rise.I [16798] c* 3 regretted, or to have had any cause to regret, the death of Bekr Sidqi. The successful movement to overthrow Yasin, which he had led, had some justilications, but Bekr Sidqi was no honest reformer reluctantly resorting to force to right the people’s wrongs. His record did not belie his character. Though he had been hailed as a national hero at the time of his march on Bagdad, ten months later his abuse of power had so destroyed his popularity, even m the army, that when he was murdered his brother officers were the first to defend those who had done him to death. 3. For the Prime Minister, Hikmat Sulaiman, his association with Bekr Sidqi was his worst misfortune. At first his efforts to confine Bekr Sidqi to his military duties and to exclude him from other national affairs had appeared to meet with success, but very little of the year under review had passed before Bekr Sidqi’s activities began to cause the Prime Minister serious embarrassment. His murderous attacks on his enemies and his profligate way of life deeply shocked and disgusted public opinion, and when Hikmat’s honest but too superficial efforts to restore peace to the Euphrates failed, Bekr s brutal use of the army, air force and police to stamp out insurrection forced the resignation of four members of the Cabinet and all but brought about the fall of the Government. 4. Hikmat Sulaiman’s relations with His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom were also troubled by Bekr Sidqi's influence. It was Bekr who was behind the urgent demands for'modern weapons for the army, and when difficulties were met with in obtaining what was asked for, it was Beki again who pressed, in the teeth of the objections of His Majesty’s Government, that orders should be given to Germany and to Italy. Nor can it be supposed that in so doing he was acting disinterestedly, for there is good reason to believe that he stood to gain much for himself from all orders placed in these two countries. In most other matters concerning Great Britain’s relations with Iraq, Bekr Sidqi’s influence was little felt, and the Ambassador was always able to do business in the frankest and most friendly manner, both with Hikmat Sulaiman and Naji-al-Asil, the Minister for Foreign Affairs. 5. The chief concern of Jamil Madfai’s Government, which succeeded that of Hikmat Sulaiman in August, was, to use their own words, to bring the waters of political life back into their former channels. Their official programme was sound but commonplace, and the Prime Minister s first urgent preoccupation was with the demands pressed upon him for revenge by Bekr Sidqi s victims. Of these the most insistent were the relatives of the late Jafar-al-Askari, who naturally demanded that his murderers should be brought to justice. But these men had protectors in high places. They rallied round them and urged that no action should be taken against Jafar s murderers, unless Bekr Sidqi’s assassins were dealt with in the same manner. The Prime Minister saw clearly the dangerous unrest to which the pursuit of revenge by the party would lead and his own wish, shared by most thinking people in the country, was that Bekr Sidqi’s death should be held to have avenged the death of Jafar and that there should be an end to the chapter of murder and violence, whether political or judicial. He wisely refused to undertake any special measures to punish those who had plotted or committed the murder of Jafar or Bekr, and determinedly left both crimes in the hands of the courts. The charges brought against Jafar’s murderers were dismissed, the courts holding that the crime was covered by the act of indemnity passed by Hikmat Sulaiman s Government, and the soldier who killed Bekr was committed to a criminal lunatic asylum. 6. Jamil Madfai applied his principles of purification to his use of patron age and continued the same policy in his choice of candidates for the new Chamber. 7. It is too early yet to say how far he will proceed in his efforts to restore stability and tranquillity to political life. Many officers in the army continue to give themselves to political intrigue. There is one group seeking opportunities to support Nuri Said’s return to power; another sides with the present Govern- ^ ment; and the third is formed of those who hope somehow to regain what they ^4 lost through the passing of Bekr. It does not seem probable that any one of these groups is yet ready to undertake direct political action, but the harm which their differences and intrigues do to the morale and discipline of the army is serious and, if the army is called upon to deal with tribal disturbances, it may not be able effectively to support the authority of the Government. In Parlia ment, too, groups of different kinds are already being formed and some fusion of these with those of the army is not improbable. There is also the unsolved problem of the Lower Euphrates. The tribes there have been quiet since the change of Government last August, but the control of the local authorities is still weak and the administration uncertain and disorganised. This area, therefore, continues to offer a tempting field for political intrigue to any group unscrupulous enough to exploit the tribal situation in a campaign against the Government. 8. On the other hand, it is satisfactory to see that in many quarters the lessons of the events of the last two years have been taken very much to heart and there is a widespread determination not to allow Governments to be overthrown or power to be seized by force, whatever the pretext may be. Nor must the important fact be overlooked that the three violent changes of Government which have occurred in recent history scarcely disturbed the even tenor of the everyday 1 life of the people. The administrative machine, on each occasion, was disorganised for a while, but for the most part the man in the street, in the village and in the tent was untouched and almost unconcerned. In spite, therefore, of the number and diversity of the factors of unrest and uncertainty in the political life of the country, the steadiness which the people as a whole have shown in trying circum stances, and the faculty of learning from experience with which many of their leaders are clearly endowed, provide grounds for a hopeful view of the future and a belief that ultimately more good than evil may well result from the period of political turmoil through which the country has been passing. 9. In the field of foreign affairs, the most important happening of the year was the signature of the frontier treaty with Iran in July. This brought to an end the long negotiations which had been necessitated by the refusal of the Iranian Government to recognise the frontier delimitations completed just before the outbreak of war in 1914. By this treaty Iraq secured the recognition of the 1914 frontier at the cost of the cession of an anchorage at Abadan, and an agreement to admit Iran to an equal share in the control of the administration of the Shatt- al-Arab. This was not a bad bargain, but, unfortunately, through his failure to heed the urgent advice of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs did not secure in the treaty proper safe guards for the maintenance of the existing organisation of the services of the Shatt-al-Arab until such time as the convention for Irano-Iraqi co-operation in this work should be concluded. This omission may lead to serious difficulties in the near future. 10. The position of King Ghazi was much discussed in high political circles towards the end of the year. There seemed to be a general consensus of opinion that His Majesty was not playing, or capable of playing, the part of Monarch as effectively and vigorously as it was desirable that it should be played in Iraq, and that his failure to do so disturbed the balance of the Constitution. There was a general feeling that, had King Faisal still been on the throne, the stormy events of the last two years would not have been permitted, and a desire made itself felt to restore somehow to the Crown the prestige and the influence which 1 it had lost. Critics of King Ghazi tend, it is true, to forget the difficulties to j which King Faisal’s active participation in affairs often gave rise, but his mastery of politics and his sure understanding of the Iraqi mind have been sadly missed since his death. The plan for strengthening the authority of the Crown which seems to find most favour is that of setting up a Crown Council to advise the King on important matters. It is true that there are constitutional and other difficulties in the way of the creation of such a council, not the least of these being the dearth of men whose position and character would fit them to be members. For this reason the plan may not be pursued. Nevertheless, the position of the King is likely to become a question of increasing urgencv whenever acute difficulties of national importance arise.[16798] c * 2 II.— Internal Affairs. The Royal Family. 11. In April King Ghazi’s second sister, the Princess Rajiha, married a subaltern in the Royal Iraqi Air Force named Abdul Jabar Mahmud, a young man of a good but undistinguished family. The Princess was deeply in love and had apparently been secretly in touch with him for some time. The marriage brought no new dignity to the Royal House, but the betrothal of the Princess with King Ghazi’s consent disposed of the real risk that, like her sister, she might have made some rash runaway match if she had been kept much longer in unnatural seclusion in the palace. 12. The Amir Abdullah of Transjordan continued from time to time to show uneasiness about the attitude of Hikmat Sulaiman’s Government towards his nephew King Ghazi. The Prime Minister had hoped that the Amir s visit to Bagdad at the end of December 1936 would allay these anxieties, but unfortunately it did not have this result. Towards the end of February His Highness frequently telephoned pressing requests to King Ghazi to meet him outside the borders of Iraq to discuss important matters. The Prime Minister feared that it was the Amir’s intention to turn King Ghazi against his Ministers, and on the ground that the Amir was acting improperly and abusing his prerogatives as a relation of the King, he asked the Ambassador to arrange that a hint should be conveyed to the Amir that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom regarded his suggestions as inopportune. In April the Prime Minister again spoke to the Ambassador about the mischievous activities of the Amir Abdullah, and showed particular annoyance at a letter which His Highness had caused to be written to an Iraqi journalist, who was then carrying on a campaign in Syria against Hikmat’s Cabinet, expressing approval of his work and inviting him to visit Amman. These incidents were brought to the notice of His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Transjordan and, through the British Resident at Amman, the Amir was advised to refrain from interfering in the affairs of Iraq and to restrict his avuncular guidance to purely family matters. 13. In August King Ghazi invited the Amir Tallal, son of the. Amir Abdullah, to visit him at Bagdad. On the advice of Jamil-al-Madfai, who had then become Prime Minister, the visit was, however, postponed. The Cabinet and Parliament. 14. At the beginning of the year Hikmat Sulaiman still retained much of the popularity which he had enjoyed when he became Prime Minister after the military revolt of the preceding October. He was beginning to realise, however, that the task of governing the country was harder than he had imagined, and though he had shown skill in keeping his colleagues together, it was already clear that their differences were likely to widen as time passed. He was, moreover, under the irksome necessity of placating the Chief of the Geneial Staff, who became more and more pressing in his demands and more impatient of ci\ilian control as the months passed by. 15. The Prime Minister’s chief preoccupations were the pacification of the Euphrates, the re-equipment of the army and the provision of the money needed for this purpose, and for the many schemes of development which he wished to carry out in all branches of the administration. 16 To deal with the Euphrates he relied on his own political skill, but from the outset he begged for the help of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to obtain munitions and money. I he story of the failure of his policy on the Euphrates, of his difficulties in obtaining munitions from Great Britain and of the disappointments of the first Iraqi loan is told under appropriate headings later in this report 17. The Prime Minister’s worst troubles with his own colleagues were due to Bekr Sidqi. Although not a member of the Cabinet, Bekr Sidqi was the man who had put Hikmat and the other Ministers into power, and his influence was therefore strong, while his views were determined and often at variance with those of the Ministers. Hikmat hoped at first that he would be able to keep Bekrquiet and amicable if only he could give him all the guns, tanks, aeroplanes and other material which he was demanding for the army. Unhappily, owing to rearmament in Great Britain, military stores were hard to obtain for Iraq, and the Prime Minister’s efforts to satisfy Bekr Sidqi from other sources involved him in serious trouble with His Majesty’s Government. The Prime Minister also found that, as the man morally, if not actually, responsible for the murder of Jafar Pasha, Bekr Sidqi was the focus of a bitter hatred from many quarters in which he himself became involved. Furthermore, Bekr’s use of a gang of lawless army officers to intimidate all those in public life who criticised his activities added considerably to the Prime Minister’s embarrassments. 18. Two incidents illustrated Bekr Sidqi’s methods. On the 20th January a well-known notable of Mosul named Dhia Tunis, who had held the important post of Secretary to the Cabinet during the latter part of Yasin-al-Hashimi’s term of office, was assassinated in the street, close to his house, in one of the new suburbs of Bagdad. The available evidence suggested that the murderers were probably Iraqi officers, but no arrests were made. It seems that Dhia Tunis had been in correspondence with Yasin-al-Hashimi (then living in the Lebanon), and that he paid for this indiscretion with his life. 19. Three weeks later an attempt was made to murder Maulad Mukhlis, a Senator and former leader of the Arab revolt against the Turks, who had been openly criticising the attitude of Hikmat Sulaiman’s Government towards the pan-Arab movement and had dubbed Bekr Sidqi a Kurdish upstart. The attempt happily failed, but Maulud Mukhlis thought it safer to leave the country. He withdrew to Syria, and did not return until after the fall of Hikmat Sulaiman’s Government in the autumn. 20. These incidents shocked the better elements of public opinion and strengthened the reaction against the Government to which other events gave further force as time passed. 21. While Bekr Sidqi was in this way following his own methods of suppressing opposition, the left wing group in the Cabinet were trying to organise a party of active supporters for their programme of land and social reform. The leaders of this movement were Jafar Abu Timman, Minister for Finance, Kamil Ghadirji, Minister for Economics and Communications, and Yusuf Iz-al-Din, Minister for Education. They called their party the People’s Reform League, but in spite of a vigorous propaganda in a daily newspaper the party received very little public support. In January the committee appealed to the Prime Minister to give his patronage to the league, but he refused, and proposed its absorption in a new Government partv with a less radical creed The league was thereupon dissolved, but the scheme of organising a party to support the Government was soon dropped on account of the discussions to which it gave rise among those to whom the task of organisation was entrusted. 22. Meanwhile, fate seemed to be helping the Government to dispose of their enemies. On the 21st January Yasin-al-Hashimi died in exile at Beirut. He had been suffering from heart trouble for some weeks, and rumour had it that the shock of the news of the murder of Dhia Yunis was fatal. The Government gave permission for the body to be brought to Iraq for burial, but, fearing disorders, they refused to allow it to be accompanied by the large delegation of Syrian Nationalists who wished to attend the funeral. In Bagdad several prominent politicians, including Sadiq Bassam, Yasin’s Minister °for Finance who were suspected of planning demonstrations for the day of the funeral were placed under preventive arrest. In view of these difficulties, the familv gave ud the idea of a funeral m Bagdad, and Yasin was buried with full honours in Damascus by the side of Saladm. .. . 2a „ A days afterwards Muhammad Zaki, the President of the Chamber died in Bagdad. 1 he coincidence of his death with that of Yasin-al-Hashimi of whom he was an old and close political friend, gave birth to the sinister ofo that Azrael (the Islamic Angel of Death) was a member of Hikmat SulaimU Cabinet I his jest was revived towards the end of March, when one of thT latf Jafar Pasha s brothers was found dead in his house. Everything pointed t been murd^red^ 1101 reaS ° nS ’ St ° rieS ^ natUrally P Ut ^ ^at he hac[16798] c* 3 Parliament. 24. The general election finished on the 20th February. In all 114 candidates were elected, an increase of eight over the number returned at the election of 1935. These increases were made ostensibly to bring the representa tion of the constituencies into line with the latest census figures. The seats given to the Diwaniyah and Muntafiq Provinces were not, however, justified by the census, but were part of the Prime Minister’s plan for pacifying the Euphrates tribes. He hoped in this way to satisfy the claims of all the contending factions. Unfortunately, the Government went too low in the social scale of their choice of candidates, and, as there were hundreds of minor tribal sheikhs who could claim to be as good as those elected on official nominations, there were many who felt jealous and slighted, and the popularity of the Cabinet suffered in consequence. 25. A feature of the new Chamber was the number of entirely new Deputies. Fifty-two out of the total of 114 had not been elected before. Among those were many young men holding advanced views and called by their critics Communists or Bolsheviks. By contrast, the tribal representation was particularly large, and the Cabinet soon found that it was no easy matter to keep the peace between these two naturally antagonistic elements. 26. King Ghazi opened Parliament on the 27th February, and the following officers were elected :— President of the Senate, Muhammad Ridha-al-Shabibi. President of the Chamber, Fakhri-al-Jamil. From the political point of view the characteristic feature of the session was the issue of communism. The Cabinet’s declared intention “to settle the land question on principles of equity and public interest and to divide State lands among the people in such a way as to preserve the right of individuals ’ ’ had been interpreted in many quarters as a plan to dispossess the large landowners and to break up, for the benefit of the peasant class, the estates which they hold on lease from the Government. This suspicion was strengthened by the advanced theories which several Ministers were known to hold and by the presence in the Chamber of the young Radicals mentioned above. Moreover, those who wished to create difficulties for the Prime Minister and his colleagues played on the fears of the propertied classes by attributing to the Cabinet extreme communistic proclivities. Several heated debates took place on this issue, but, in spite of his categoric denials, the Prime Minister never quite succeeded in cleansing his Cabinet from the “ Red ” stigma with which his Administration was branded by his opponents. 27. For the first time for many years there was no prolongation of the session, and Parliament was prorogued on the 26th June. Little legislation of first-class importance was enacted. The most interesting of the measures passed are summarised below :— The law for the attachment of revenue labels to articles of merchandise: giving powers to the Government to prescribe by regulations that specified articles shall bear a special label as evidence that customs or excise duty has been paid on them. The Supreme Defence Council Law : providing interdepartmental co-ordination in all matters concerning the defence of the country. The law for the indemnification of persons who carried out the national movement: to indemnify those who took part in the cou'p d’Etat of October 1936.

Probably the most important problem to which Hikmat Sulaiman, both as Prime Minister and as Minister for the Interior, had to attend was that of pacifying the tribes of the Middle Euphrates. Ever since the spring of 1935, when he himself, with Yasin-al-Hashimi and Rashid Ali-al-Gilani, had over- thrown a Government by means of an organised agitation among these tribes, they had been turbulent and defiant. In 1936 Yasin’s Administration had tried without lasting success to subdue the tribes of Diwaniyah by force, and the severity which they had employed had been one of Hikmat’s chief justifications for the movement by which he had supplanted his predecessors. He was therefore on his mettle to show that he could handle the situation better than they. 29. His first step, taken shortly after he came into office in October 1936, was to move King Ghazi to pardon all the tribesmen who had been sentenced to imprisonment by the military courts set up by Yasin’s Government and to restore to their owners all the properties which had been confiscated by orders of these courts. He next endeavoured to alleviate the economic distress, to which the military operations of the past two years had led, by organising irrigation and other public works on which the many hundreds of destitute men could be employed. Early in February he made a personal tour of the Middle Euphrates area and did much to restore confidence in the Government among the shaken and embittered tribesmen. 30. The central figure on the political side of the problem was Khawwam-al- Abbas of the Bani Zuraij tribe of Samawa. In 1935 he had been banished to the north and his property had been confiscated and the greater part of it transferred to his rival and second cousin, Shanshul. When Hikmat Sulaiman became Minister of the Interior, Khawwam was pardoned and the confiscation of his estates cancelled. But Shanshul refused to give up the land and the perennial trouble-makers, Abdul Wahid of the Fatlah and Saiyid Muhsin Abu Tabikh, encouraged him to be obstinate. Khawwam responded by rallying to his cause the tribal elements opposed to Abdul Wahid and Saiyid Muhsin, and both sides began to threaten the local authorities. 31. In addition to this main dispute a host of minor sheikhs and tribal leaders were taking advantage of the weakness and the dislocation of the civil administration to revive old quarrels, to extort favours and to busy themselves with intrigues of every kind in the manner so characteristic of the Middle Euphrates people. 32. The Prime Minister exerted himself tirelessly to bring about a peaceful settlement. At first he was full of hope, but he soon began sadly to realise that he was being no more successful than his predecessors and, slowly but inevitably, he was driven to coercive measures. By the end of April Abdul Wahid and Muhsin Abu Tabikh were distributing large numbers of rifles among the tribes, and their activities threatened to lead to serious disturbances. Hikmat Sulaiman thereupon had them suddenly arrested and removed to Kirkuk, and obtained unanimous approval of this action from both Houses of Parliament. The two men were later tried under the Tribal Regulations and sentenced to three years’ rigorous imprisonment. Shanshul, the rival of Khawwam, was also dealt with in a similar manner. 33. Hikmat Sulaiman, in conversation with the Ambassador, claimed that by this action he had gone a long way towards bringing quiet to a district where disorder was endemic and that his Government had gathered much strength. Once again events proved him to be over-optimistic. 34. About the middle of June fighting broke out in the Samawa district, where the tribesmen attacked the forces sent there to erect several police posts. Air operations were then undertaken and a number of villages destroyed. Decisive results were not, however, achieved by these means, and towards the end of the month a determined but unsuccessful tribal attack was made on Samawa town In this and other engagements the Iraqi police inflicted heavy casualties on the tribal forces and ugly stories reached Bagdad of the shooting of a number of tribal hostages.[16798] c * 4 The Resignation of Four Ministers. 35. These events had important political consequences. Four Ministers, Jafar Abu Timman, Salih Jabr, Kamil Chadirji and Yusuf Iz-al-I)in resigned publicly, declaring that they could no longer retain office in a Cabinet which had acted with such unwarranted harshness in dealing with these tribal difficulties. A further reason was undoubtedly their dissatisfaction with the dominant influence of Bekr Sidqi over the military and police operations which had been undertaken. They complained that things were done by Bekr Sidqi’s orders of which they did not approve and for which they would not accept responsibility. 36. These resignations were a heavy buffet to the Prime Minister. He first tried to restore his position by persuading Naji Shaukat (who was in Bagdad at the time with the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs) and Jamil-al-Madfai to join him, and they would have accepted office if he could have satisfied them that he would confine Bekr Sidqi’s influence to the proper sphere of the Chief of the General Staff. Hikmat was, however, unable to do this and he was in consequence obliged to turn to men of second rank to fill the gaps in his team. In such a position it was perhaps wise to choose among the more experienced officials rather than among untried politicians, and he eventually reorganised his Cabinet in the following manner :— Prime Minister : Hikmat Sulaiman. Interior : Mustafa-al-Umari. Finance : Muhammad Ali Mahmud. Foreign Affairs : Naji-al-Asil. Economics and Communications : Abbas Mahdi. Justice : Ali Mahmud-al-Sheikh Ali. Defence : Abdul Latif Nuri. Education : Jafar Hamandi. 37. The inclusion of Mustafa-al-Umari, a senior civil servant, brought valuable administrative experience to a department where it was much needed. Muhammad Ali Mahmud had made something of a reputation as president of the Finance Committee of the Chamber, and Abbas Mahdi, though a weak and colourless personality, had had earlier experience of the Ministry of which he assumed control. Ali Mahmud-al-Sheikh Ali had served many years at the Bar, and, although in the past he had been a violent nationalist, it was hoped that time had moderated his ardour and that he would be tamed by the responsibilities of office. None of the new comers, however, brought any political strength to the Cabinet or offered any promise that an effective restraint would be put on Bekr Sidqi, against whose public and private conduct dissatisfaction was now evidently increasing, both in the army itself and among the public. 38. For a little over a month the reorganised Cabinet appeared to be working reasonably well. The Minister for Finance handled the loan negotia tions with sense and diligence and the Minister for the Interior (who knew the district well) made a good beginning with the tribes of the Middle Euphrates. But an event soon took place which entirely changed the political situation and brought Hikmat Sulaiman s term of office to an abrupt end. The Murder of Bekr Sidqi. 39. On the evening of the 10th August, General Bekr Sidqi left Bagdad for Mosul by train en route for Turkey, where he was to attend the autumn manoeuvres. The following morning he was joined by Major Muhammad Ali Jawad, the Officer Commanding the Royal Iraqi Air Force. ^ In the evening, while they were both in the garden of the Iraqi air force officers mess, Beki feidqi was shot through the head by a corporal who had concealed himself in the verandah close by. Muhammad Ali rushed at the assassin and in his tuin was shot through the chest. Both victims died immediately. At the sound of the firing several officers hurried out of their rooms, and the corporal was seized and placed under arrest, 40. As soon as the crime was reported to military headquarters at Mosul, a cordon was drawn round the camp and the military assumed control of the town. The bodies were sent to Bagdad by air the next morning, where they were buried with imposing military ceremonial.10 41. No details of the crime appeared in the press, which merely reproduced a brief official communique, and none except Bekr Sidqi’s own organ Defence expressed any admiration for the deceased officers or any regret at their death. 42. Enquiries revealed that the murder was the outcome of a conspiracy matured by the friends of Bekr Sidqi’s political victims and by his personal enemies in the army. The assassin himself was a distant relative of Dhia Yunis, whose murder early in the year has already been related. It is possible that Nuri-al-Said knew of the plot, and that it had the tacit approval of General Amin-al-Umari, the military commander at Mosul. 43. This general played an important, perhaps a decisive, part in the events of the next few days. He refused to obey the orders sent to him to arrest and despatch to Bagdad a number of officers whom the Government suspected of complicity in the murders, and he indicated that the troops under his command would resist by force any action taken by the Government to enforce obedience to these orders. Two days after the murders he issued a manifesto justifying his attitude, and at the same time, by adroit manoeuvres, he won over the commanders at Kirkuk and Bagdad. The Cabinet of Jamil-al-Madfai. 44. Hikmat Sulaiman seems at first to have thought that he would be able to deal with the situation by a show of firmness and determination, but in a few days he was forced to realise that it was beyond his control. He then tendered his resignation to King Ghazi, and recommended that Jamil-al-Madfai should be invited to form a Government. 45. The King acted on this advice, and on the 17th August the following Ministers were appointed by Royal Iradah :— Prime Minister and Defence : Jamil-al-Madfai. Interior : Mustafa-al-Umari. Justice: Abbas Mahdi. Foreign Affairs : Taufiq-al-Suwaidi. Finance: Ibrahim Kamal. Economics and Communications : Jalal Baban. Education : Muhammad Ridha-al-Shabibi. All of these, excepting Ibrahim Kamal, had been Ministers before, and the Cabinet was well up to the Iraqi average in ability and influence. 46. The Prime Minister’s first task was to deal with the army. General Husain Fawzi, who was next in seniority to Bekr Sidqi, was appointed Chief of the General Staff, and Amin-al-Umari was promoted to the command of the Bagdad district. Some fifty officers, who had been conspicuous supporters of Bekr Sidqi, were put on the retired list, and three of his aides-de-camp were placed under arrest and charged with the attempt to murder Maulad Mukhlis. The Prime Minister also announced his intention of keeping the army strictly out of politics and of restoring normality in political life in°general. ' He then dissolved Parliament, following the practice which is becoming firmly established whereby a general election is required after each change of Government. 47. His measures to deal with the Euphrates were the release from prison of Abdul Wahid, Muhsin Abu Tabikh and Shanshul, and the completion of the ten new defensible police posts in the Samawa district planned by Hikmat Sulaiman. 48. There was no further outbreak of disturbances in the Diwaniyah Province before the end of the year, but these measures alone will not be enough to ensure lasting tranquillity or effectively to restore the authority of the Government. The New Parliament. 49. The general elections finished on the 18th December. The Government devoted considerable care to the choice of candidates, and the result was a Chamber which compared favourably with any which had been returned before and included men who represented nearly every shade of opinion and most of thevdio ) . [16798] d* 11 important community interests. Hikmat Sulaiman was not, however, nominated as an official candidate, and with the exception of Muhammad Ali Mahmud, none of his Cabinet colleagues was elected. In the Chamber Maulud Mukhlis was elected President, and in the Senate Saiyid Muhammad-al-Sadr once more returned to the chair. The Assyrians. 50. After the breakdown in the spring of 1936 of the scheme for settling the Assyrians in the Ghab area of the Lebanon, the Assyrian Committee of the Council of the League were instructed by the Council to continue their efforts to discover an alternative plan of settlement for those who still wished to leave Iraq. At the time of the autumn session of the Council in 1936 it had become clear that the only remaining possibility of finding a home for the Assyrians outside Iraq lay with the British Empire. Reconsideration of the situation in 1937 revealed, however, that the practical difficulties which had been found to exist had not diminished, and in the end this hope too had to be abandoned. Meanwhile, in June, the Council Committee sent a small mission to the Khabur to collect data to enable it to make recommendations to the Council at their meeting in September 1937 for the reorganisation of the Khabur settlement on a self- supporting basis. 51. The commission reported that it would be possible to do this, provided that further capital expenditure was authorised for the purchase of additional land, euipment and live-stock, and that the reorganisation of certain villages was undertaken, including the removal southwards of the population of the few most northerly villages. They estimated that the total cost of these measures would be about £51,000 sterling. 52. In September the committee made a report to the Council explaining the impossibility of arranging a comprehensive scheme for the settlement of the Assyrians who wished to leave Iraq or of moving elsewhere the Assyrians on the Khabur, and recommending the adoption of the scheme prepared by the mission referred to above for making the Khabur settlement self-supporting. As regards the Assyrians in Iraq, the committee pointed out that it was desirable that these Assyrians should become finally incorporated in the Iraqi population as ordinary citizens. They considered that they were no longer in a position to deal with the question of the Assyrians in Iraq, and recommended that the Council should terminate the relevant part of their mandate of October 1933. At the same time they suggested that the Council should invite the Iraqi Government to take all necessary and possible steps in the spirit of the Council’s resolution of December 1932 to help the Assyrians remaining in Iraq to settle down as a prosperous and y . contented community. 53. The Iraqi representative (the Minister for Foreign Affairs) stated that, subject to ultimate parliamentary sanction, his Government were willing to contribute, yari passu with His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, towards the reorganisation of the Khabur settlements, and declared that the Assyrians remaining in Iraq could rely on the Government to help them equally with other elements of the population. The Iraqi Government would, moreover, send to the north as soon as possible an expert from their Land Settlement Department to conduct an enquiry into the economic situation of the Assyrians and the neighbouring population. He undertook to inform the Council in due course about the expert’s report and the effect which his Government would give to his recommendations. The committee’s report was supported by the United Kingdom delegate and adopted by the Council without opposition. 54. In November the Iraqi Government deputed a senior British official to ^ visit the Assyrian villages and to draw up a report on the measures which were necessary to give effect to the undertakings given to the Council regarding the economic future of the Assyrians remaining in Iraq. The Assyrians in the Harir. 55. On several occasions the future of the Assyrians (about 400 families l mostly of the Shamsdin tribe), now settled on the Harir plain in the Arbil district, was considered by the Council Committee, and the conclusion was reached that it12 would probably be in the best interests of these people if they were transferred to the Khabur, when the settlement was made permanent. The commission of enquiry which visited the Khabur in June estimated that the additional cost of money for establishing the Shamsdin on the Khabur would be £20,000, but the Council Committee ultimately decided that, in view of the uncertain political future of the Khabur regime, they would not be able to take the responsibility of transferring the Shamsdin to the Khabur, even if the financial and political agree ment of all the interested parties could be obtained. Nevertheless, it was left open for the committee to deal with this question in direct negotiation with the Iraqi Government if circumstances became more favourable in the future. A Scheme to send A ssyrians to A hyssinia. 56. In July an Italian named Pastori, who stated that he was a railway contractor, came to Bagdad and sought the permission of the Iraqi Government to recruit labour for Eritrea and Abyssinia among the Assyrians in Iraq. He offered free passages, a contract for a year's emplojunent with wages and rations, and in addition a cash advance to each family to buy 15 hectares of land repayable over fifteen years. 57. A short time later he went back to Rome where he reformed the company with German, Italian and Swiss capital. In October he renewed formal applica tion to the Iraqi Government for permission to establish direct contact with the Assyrians. The Iraqi Government had no objection in principle to his proposals, but before giving him the permission for which he had applied they asked the Italian Legation to advise them regarding the bona fides of the company which Pastori was representing. No reply had been received to this enquiry before the end of the year. The Yazidis. 58. The Sin jar district remained quiet throughout the year, though the Yazidis have not yet altogether recovered from the rough treatment which they experienced at the hands of the army in the autumn of 1935. Nevertheless, the release in November 1936 by Hikmat Sulaiman of all remaining Yazidi prisoners did much to restore confidence and to relieve distress in the villages. 59. The Sammoqa, a nomadic section of the tribe, again sought to avoid conscription by crossing into Syria in the spring, but returned without incident later in the year. Conscription was and is likely to continue to be the main cause of difficulties between the Yazidis and the Government. It seems that many different expedients have been tried to make service in the army more palatable to them but without much success. Although details are not available, it is known that a number of Yazidis have submitted under pressure to the law and joined the colours, but many desert very soon and flee to the Sinjar, where they often take to robbery and other forms of lawlessness. With a people so primitive and wild it is difficult to find a solution for this question, especially as the only plan likely to succeed, the creation of class units where the Yazidis could serve together, is one to which the Iraqi Government, not without good reasons, are, in principle, very much opposed. 60. During the year the Mutessarif of Mosul again intervened to prevent Shammar penetration into the Sinjar, and seems to have held the balance wisely between the conflicting claims of the two tribes. Labour. 61. During the year labour questions have for the first time begun to assume importance in internal affairs. Although on coming into office Hikmat Sulaiman’s Government made no specific promises to help labour, it was well known that Kamil Chadirji, the Minister of Economics and Communications, and two other Ministers held Left-Wing views on social matters, and for this reason one or two habitual agitators, feeling confident that they would have support in the Cabinet, very soon began to encourage the workers in the larger enterprises to put forward demands for improved conditions. In December 1936 the day labourers employed by Messrs. Balfour, Beatty (Limited) on the Kut Barrage struck for shorter hours,and in January the men employed by the British Oil Development Company followed their example. Both strikes failed. In January the weavers in Najaf struck for higher wages and won their point. About the same time there was also a series of small strikes among railway employees, and most of their demands were met by the Railway Directorate. In March the day labourers of the Port of Basra struck for a wage increase of §\d. a day and food. They returned to work on being conceded a minimum wage of 2s. a day without food and compensation for serious injury suffered while on duty. A short time afterwards the employees of the Bata shoe factory in Bagdad came out on strike, but soon returned with their demands unsatisfied. In June there was a serious strike in the Kirkuk Oil fields of the Iraq Petroleum Company. The object of the workers was to obtain payment of wages for the weekly holiday provided for in article 3 of the Labour Law enacted in April 1936. The meaning of this article was ambiguous and the company had begun payment only with effect from the date of an explanatory circular issued by the Ministry of the Interior in March 1937. The men demanded retrospective payment with effect from the date of the coming into force of the Labour Law itself. They were supported by the Government and ultimately the company gave way and accepted their demands. Other British concerns which were then confronted with similar claims from their work-people were Messrs. Balfour, Beatty (contractors for the Kut Barrage), Messrs. Holloway Brothers (contractors for the Bagdad bridges), Messrs. Humphreys (contractors for the Dhibban cantonment), and the Bagdad Light and Power Company. The Bagdad Light and Power Company took a test case to court. Their contention was, firstly, that the Ministry of the Interior had no power to interpret legisla tion, and, secondly, that the Ministry’s interpretation was false. The other firms stood out against the claims pending the result of this test case. The hearing of this case opened on the 28th December, and no judgment had been given before the end of the year. 62. British commercial houses and banks operating in Iraq which employ mainly clerical labour on monthly wages complied with the law from the date of the Ministry’s notification referred to above, and received no claims from their employees in respect of the earlier period during which the law was declared to have been in force. In any event the number of claims which could have been put forward would have been few and relatively unimportant. 63. The following regulations were issued under the Labour Law of 1936 :— A regulation fixing the hours of work in industrial undertakings (issued under the second clause of article 2). A regulation for the payment of compensation (issued under article 11). A regulation for the proportionate distribution of compensation to the dependants of deceased workers (issued under article 26 (i)). A regulation defining occupational diseases (issued under article 18). A regulation for workmen’s associations (issued under article 26 (i)). A regulation for workshops and factories (issued under article 2, paragraph 22). 64. Laws were also passed enabling Iraq to accede to the following inter national conventions dealing with labour questions :— The International Convention concerning the Employment of Women by Night (Geneva, 9th August, 1934). The International Convention concerning Workmen’s Compensation for Occupational Diseases (Geneva, 19th May, 1925). A rchmoloqy. 65. Only two archaeological expeditions came out to Iraq for the season of 1937-38 :— (1) The German expedition of the Deutsche Forschungs-Gemeinschaft, of Berlin, under Dr. Arnold Nolecke, which continued its work at Warka-Uruk. [16798] d* 214 (2) The joint expedition of the American School of Oriental Research, Bagdad, and the University Museum of Philadelphia, under Mr. Charles Bache, which continued its work at Tappa Gaura (near Khorsabad) and took over at Khafaji the excavations begun by the Oriental Institute of Chicago. Distinguished Visitors. 66. In January Sir Ferouz Khan Nooni, the High Commissioner for India, spent a night at the Embassy when passing through on his way to England by air. He met the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs and discussed the possibility of supplying some of the military and other stores required by the Iraqi Government from the Indian Stores Department in London. 67. Mr. Rendel broke his journey to Riyadh to stay at the Embassy for three days in February. During his visit he had opportunities to meet a number of the leading Iraqi personalities. 68. In April General Sir H. ap Rhys Pryce, Master-General of Ordnance in India, passed through Bagdad on his way to the United Kingdom. He discussed with the head of the military mission the question of guns and ammunition required by the Iraqi Government, and was able to make several useful offers to supply material from India. 69. In May His Holiness Sardar Saiyidna Saifuddin, the High Pontiff of the Dawoodi Bohra Community of Bombay, passed through Bagdad on his return from a pilgrimage to Mecca. He visited Karbala and Najaf and distributed alms generously to the poor. The Lord Mayor of Bagdad gave a garden party in his honour. 70. His Highness the Agha Khan spent the night of the 21st November in Bagdad on his way through to India by Imperial Airways. He had tea with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and dined at the Embassy. 71. In early December Prince Peter of Greece paid a short visit to Bagdad on his way to Iran. He was travelling incognito. 72. For the visits of His Royal Highness the Amir Saud, Dr. Tewfiq Aras, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, Colonel Muirhead and M. Samii respectively, see para graphs 228, 235, 229, 264 and 195 of this report. The Political Exiles. 73. The murder of Bekr Sidqi and the fall of Hikmat Sulaiman’s Government enabled all those to return to Iraq who had thought it best to leave the country after the military revolt of October 1936. Nuri Said came back at the end of October, and Rashid Ali-al-Gilani followed him about a fortnight later. Maulad Mukhlis, the attempt on whose life has been related in an earlier para graph, and Rustam Haidar reappeared in Bagdad soon afterwards. Others of lesser importance also returned unobtrusively and some were reinstated in their old posts in the Administration. 74. Nuri-al-Said left Bagdad again on the 15th December for Syria and the Lebanon, where he got in touch with the exiled Grand Mufti of Jerusalem and with other Arab leaders. His intention was clearly to try to discover some plan for a better understanding between the Jews and the Arabs about the future of Palestine. His own idea, as explained to the Ambassador, was that this would be possible on the basis of the inclusion of Palestine in a confederation of Arab States united under one Crown in the manner of the British Dominions. Much that he said suggested that his own views favoured King Abdul Aziz, rather than King Ghazi, as the titular head of this confederation. The views of the other Arab leaders with whom he discussed his somewhat hazy ideas are not yet known. 75. The departure of Nuri-al-Said from Iraq was encouraged by the Prime Minister, and probably by the King. The Government offered him'the post of Minister in London, but Nuri Pasha preferred to work out his destiny free fromofficial obligations and evidently felt that the Palestine question, linked with pan-Arab aspirations, offered a hopeful field in which to recover his somewhat tarnished prestige as an Arab statesman. Reactions to Events in Palestine. 76. On the 2nd January a delegation of Palestinian Arab leaders returned to Jerusalem from Bagdad, taking with them identic letters from King Abdul Aziz and King Ghazi, advising the Arab Higher Committee to drop their boycott of the Boyal Commission, then in Palestine, and to co-operate in the commission’s work. This advice was accepted and the boycott of the Royal Commission was called off on the 6th January. 77. Subsequently frequent informal discussions took place between the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Ambassador, regarding the recommendations which the Iraqi Government might make to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom on the Palestinian question. Their views were ultimately embodied in an official memorandum which was handed to the Ambassador on the 15th April. The measures which were advocated in this memorandum were :— The total suspension of Jewish immigration for a limited period. The future control of Jewish immigration on the basis of the maintenance of the existing ratio of the Arab and Jewish population. The strict control of the sale of land to the Jews by Arabs. 78. About the same time several Iraqi newspapers reproduced forecasts made in the British press that the report of the commission would favour a division of Palestine into separate Arab and Jewish zones. They hotly criticised this proposal, declaring that Great Britain could commit no greater act of perfidy towards the Arabs than to take half of Palestine and give it to the Jews. The Prime Minister also took alarm at these rumours and warned the Ambassador that the Arabs would never accept any such arrangement. 79. The official summary of the Royal Commission’s report, together with His Majesty’s Government’s statement of policy, were published in Iraq on the 8th July. The impression made was bad; the Prime Minister called on the Ambassador, formally protested against the decision to partition Palestine, and maintained that it was everywhere regarded as unjust and unfortunate. He added that he feared public opinion, which was already excited, would find expression in meetings and demonstrations. Nevertheless, he said that he was fully alive to his responsibility for keeping order, and undertook to use all the resources at his command to prevent breaches of the peace. 80. On the following day he gave an interview to the press, in which he stated that, by their recommendations, the Royal Commission had struck to the heart every Arab and Moslem, and, as head of an Arab Government, he proclaimed that the hour had come for the Arabs everywhere to rise and stand as an impregnable barrier for the defence of their right to live. He also bitterly attacked the Amir Abdullah for his alleged willingness to support the partition scheme. At the same time, the Iraqi Government instructed their Minister in London to make a written protest to His Majesty’s Government. 81. Acting on instructions from the Secretary of State, the Ambassador visited the Prime Minister and informed him that, while His Majesty’s Govern ment appreciated the delicacy of his position, they must protest strongly against his expression of sympathy with the Arabs of Palestine being so formulated as to increase the difficulties' of a settlement, and that they could not regard his recent action as compatible with the spirit of the Anglo-Iraqi Alliance. The Prime Minister expressed regret that his statement to the press had given offence to His Majesty’s Government, but explained that no Iraqi Government could remain in office that did not give some measure of satisfaction to public hatred for the proposed partition of Palestine. To representatives of the Arab Higher Committee in Palestine, who visited him in Iraq, he gave the advice that they should remain quiet and await the verdict of the Council of the League of Nations on the British proposals. [16798] d* 316 82. From this point, although a number of public meetings were held at which resolutions were passed, public manifestations of dislike of British policy in Palestine were kept within the limits of the newspapers. Press criticism was at first extravagant, though there was no real incitement to violence. Gradually, however, the heat of the daily attacks on the Royal Commission s repoit and on His Maiesty’s Government began to cool and, after the debate on Palestine in the House of Commons on the 21st and 22nd July, a faint hope dawned that, after all, the partition of Palestine might not become a fact. 83. The next events of importance took place at Geneva. At the end of July the Iraqi Government instructed their delegate to the League of Nations to communicate a memorandum to the Permanent Mandates Commission (then holding a special session) protesting against the British proposal to partition Palestine, and claiming that the best solution of the Palestinian question lay in the early setting up of self-governing institutions in that countiy in accordance with article 22 of the Covenant of the League. 84. The political crisis which was caused by the murder of the Chief of the General Staff in August diverted attention for a time from the Palestinian question, but the new Government formed by Jamil-al-Madfai made speedy arrangements for Iraq to be represented at the autumn session of the Assembly by a strong delegation headed by Taufiq-al-Suwaidi, the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Although his official instructions were to oppose any scheme of partition, Taufiq-al-Suwaidi discharged his mission with great tact. He maintained close touch with the British delegation and, while stoutly defending the Arab point of view, he avoided any action likely to cause serious difficulties for His Majesty’s Government. In the debates in tlie Sixth Committee he made a particularly able speech. On his return to Bagdad he informed His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires that, having made the Arab point of view perfectly clear at Geneva, he saw nothing to gain from encouraging irresponsible clamour in the press or in the street. ° He gave effect to these views by exercising a restraining influence over the local journalists. 85. In the meanwhile, Iraqis had taken a prominent part at the Bludan Congress (the 8th-10th September) organised by the Arabs as a reply to the Zionist Congress at Zurich. Twelve Iraqi delegates attended, and Naji-al- Suwaidi, the brother of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, presided. Resolutions were passed rejecting the partition of Palestine, which was declared to be an integral part of the Arab fatherland. 86. After his return to Bagdad Naji-al-Suwaidi gathered together an influential committee to reorganise and strengthen the Palestine Defence League. He also headed a representative deputation to the Embassy to protest against British policy in Palestine. A formal written protest against “ the policy of rigour and severity ” adopted by His Majesty’s Government after the renewed outbreak of terrorism which began with the murder of Mr. Andrews in late September was also made by the Iraqi Government through the diplomatic channel. 87. The creation of special military courts in Palestine in November and the execution of Sheikh Farhan-al-Sadi for illegally carrying arms caused a fresh outcry in Iraq. On the day of Farhan’s execution students demonstrated outside the Cabinet’s offices, and 'violent attacks on British policy in Palestine were renewed in the press. 88. Towards the end of the year public excitement had subsided and in general people had once again relapsed into quiet hopefulness that in the end British statesmanship would find a better solution than partition. Nevertheless, the press and the Palestine Defence League, by frequent articles and meetings, did their best to keep the question of Palestine and the fate of the Arabs there constantly alive in the public mind. Education. General. 89. In the course of the summer, the Minister of Education hinted to Sir Archibald Clark Kerr that the Iraqi Government would find it difficult to go on sending boys to the United Kingdom to complete their education unless17 facilities at least equal to those granted by foreign countries were offered thera. In July this hint was followed up by an official note from the Iraqi in which obiections were raised to the present practice whereby iiaqi s who are desirous of entering universities in the United Kingdom are retired t pass the usual matriculation examination. I he attitude of the Butis uni contrasted unfavourably, it was stated, with that taken up b Y educationa authorities in certain other countries, where the Iraqi official ceitificates we recognised as equivalent to local tests; and as a result Iraqi students were beginning to go elsewhere than to the United Kingdom for purposes of study. With a view, therefore, to maintaining the flow of students to the United Kingdom, the Iraqi Government asked that the appropriate authorities in Ureat Britain might be requested to recognise certificates granted by Iraqi secondaiy schools as equivalent to their own matriculation tests. 90 The request was duly referred to London. As there appeared, however, to be considerable doubt whether the university authorities would a^ept the certificate, which is not itself a very valuable test of knowledge, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr thought it best—with a view to forestalling a flat non possumus to suggest the possibility of a compromise solution. According to this suggestion the Iraqi secondary school certificate would be accepted as equivalent to the British matriculation test if combined with a certificate-—possibly the Cambudge Certificate for Proficiency in English—which could be gained after an extra vear’s study at a continuation school, where a limited number of subjects would be studied under British teachers (employees of the Iraqi Government). 91. If as the Embassy have reason to believe, the chief object of the Ministry of Education in raising the issue under discussion was to secure the accep ance by the British educational authorities of tests applied in Iraq by officials of Iraqi Government, this compromise might well prove acceptable, tbe e ^. d the vear His Majesty’s Embassy had still heard nothing of the attitude of the British universities concerned towards the original Iraqi proposal or the suggested compromise. 92 In the meantime, scarcely any of the students who have left Iraq to take educational courses have entered British universities; and unless something is done to meet Iraqi wishes in the matter of matriculation tests, it seems piobable that nearly all students who go abroad will, m fact, take their degrees in foreign universities—with results clearly harmful to Anglo-Iraqi relations. Matriculation School. * 93. Of the thirteen students who had been preparing for ^ matriculation examination at the special school opened for the P« r P&lt;^M paragraph 93 of last year’s report), only five passed. U‘s w^s “6 cause considerable disappointment to the Iraqi educational au *orities who had expected better results, and the matriculation school as o At, amount of university authorities, were consequently subjected to a certain am criticism. 94. In October, when the school reopened, its scope was enlarged to include external students, who pay a small fee, as well as Government students (now on y seven in number), who live at the school free of charge and receive free tuition. In addition to their duties at this school, the teaching staff, who can spaie the time as a result of the reduction in the number of Government students, are now entrusted with the English instruction, which is the most important feature of a new Government school for foreign languages (evening classes). These evening classes, at which French and German are also taught, were being attended at the end of the vear by about 400 pupils (mostly Government officials) ihe Dnector- General of‘Educational Instruction has approved the principle that the work of the English classes should be directed towards gaming the Cambridge University Certificate for Proficiency in English; and steps are being taken with a view to instituting a centre for'that examination in Bagdad The existence of tne evening classes has on the whole strengthened the probability of the continuance of the Matriculation School, as they provide more work for the staff and leave less ground for the criticism to which the school was subjected last year on the ground that the expenditure involved was not justified for the sake of so ew students. [16798] D95. Nevertheless, in the opinion of the headmaster of the school, its existence is, to say the least, precarious, and it is perhaps unlikely to continue for long in its present form. It might have some future if British educational authorities agreed to the compromise mentioned in paragraph 90 above, in which case it might be made use of for the continuation course whereby students who had passed the secondary school examination would qualify for entry to British universities. Communications. 96. Work on the Tel-Kotchek-Mosul-Baiji railway extension, which was inaugurated in November 1936, went forward more slowly than the Government had hoped. The Baiji-Mosul section is being constructed almost entirely by manual labour (recruited from the nomadic Shammar tribesmen), and rapid progress is unlikely. On the Tel-Kotchek-Mosul section up-to-date American machinery is being used, and it is hoped, perhaps over-optimistically, that the first train will reach Mosul in the autumn of 1938. The site of the Mosul Railway Station is being levelled and enclosed. 97. The ambitious road construction programme of Hikmat Sulaiman, which was to involve a total expenditure, over five years, of 2,500,000 Iraqi dinars, did not get beyond the stage of being a £ ‘ project.” The Kampsax consortium tried hard to persuade the Iraqi Government to entrust them with the execution of the proposed development, and Messrs. Balfour, Beatty and Co. put forward a scheme. Financial considerations led to the shelving of the whole project in June. Nothing more has been heard of it. 98. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom sanctioned, early in 1937, the expenditure of £200,000 on the construction of the Transjordan section of the Bagdad-IIaifa road. It accordingly became necessary to take up with the Iraqi Government the question of carrying out improvements on the section of the road which lies in Iraqi territory. His Majesty’s Ambassador approached the Iraqi Government in the matter, and a note was received in reply stating that, although the Iraqi Government were devoting attention to the track between Ramadi and Rutba, they could not commit themselves to the required expenditure on the road between the latter place and the Transjordan frontier. His Majesty’s Embassy, after consultation with the chief engineer, British Forces in Iraq (who in his turn consulted the Public Works Department of the Iraqi Government), replied that only minor improvements were necessary; that all these would be on that porfion of the track which is also the regular route to Damascus; and that the total cost would be less than £3,000. They hoped, therefore, that something might be done. 99. In December the Iraqi Government agreed to carry out certain of the improvements suggested. A little later His Majesty’s Embassy learned from the Foreign Office that the whole question of constructing the road would have to be reconsidered in view of a renewed estimate whereby the Transjordan section would cost three times as much as had been expected. As, however, the part of the road which the Iraqi Government had been asked to repair lies east of the place where the Haifa track branches off from the Damascus road, it did not seem necessary to cancel any of the suggestions made by His Majesty’s’ Embassy to the Iraqi Government. Internal Civil Aviation. 100. In Iraq, by an unfortunate arrangement which, however, is unlikely to be altered, civil aviation remains under the Ministry of Defence, and its director is also Director of the Royal Iraqi Air Force. 101. The late Director, Mohammad Ali Jawad, told the British Inspectcr of the Iiaqi An Foice in January that early action would be taken to found a National Airway Company. The Iraqi Government, he added, would probablv require the help of a British company in carrying out this project, but, before reaching a decision in the matter, he wished to put his proposals before various foreign missions in Bagdad, in order to see how Iraqi requirements could best be met. Nothing more was heard of the matter, and it does not look as though at19 [16798] e* the time of his murder, Ali Jawad had gone so far as to consult any foreign missions. There is, indeed, no progress to report in civil aviation during me year. The new Director (Akram Mushtaq) has scarcely had time as yet to come to grips with the problems which beset him, and a beginning has not even been made with certain new works at the airport which have been promised tor some time and are much needed. III. —Foreign Relations. British Empire. General. Their Majesties' Coronation. 102. The occasion of the Coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth was appropriately celebrated in Bagdad. The day began at 7 o clock in the morning with a parade of the Royal Air Force at Hinaidi, at which His Majesty’s Ambassador took the salute. The parade, in which some 1,200 men took part, was attended by the Iraqi Prime Minister and Cabinet, the whole of the Diplomatic Corps, and large numbers of the British and British-Indian communities. At lO’SO a special service was held at the St. George s Memorial Church. Special services were also held in the temples of the various Indian communities. At midday Sir Archibald Clark Kerr received a visit from the Chaldean Patriarch, who was accompanied by the bishops of the I niate Churches in Iraq. At his Beatitude’s request, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr promised to convey the good wishes and congratulations of the Iraqi Uniate Churches to their Majesties. In the afternoon the Ambassador attended a garden party given by the Indian Association in Iraq, at which a loyal address was presented for submission to their Majesties. In the evening Sir Archibald and Lady Clark Kerr gave a party in the Embassy garden which was attended by some 900 guests, including all the members of the Iraqi Government, a large number of officials, military officers, notables, tribal sheikhs and Kurdish chiefs, as well as by the officers of the military mission and of the Royal Air Force and by the British community. Most of the Bagdad newspapers devoted leading articles, the tone of which was markedly friendly, to the Coronation. His Majesty s consuls at Mosul and Basra both gave receptions in honour of the day, at which the local notabilities were present; and a service at the English church at Basra was attended by His Majesty’s consul and the British community. Messages expressing loyalty and devotion to The King and Queen on the occasion of their Majesties’ coronation were received from the following :— t The Arya Samaj, The Jamiat-al-Ahmadiya, and The Central Sikh Committee. Iraqi Representatives at the Coronation. 103. In February the Iraqi Government informed His Majesty s Embassy that Iraq would be represented at their Majesties’ Coronation by a delegation consisting of the Amir Abdulillah, first cousin of King Ghazi, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Iraqi Minister in London. Difficulties about the Amir s presence arose, however, on the ground that His Highness was not an Iraqi subject. The Minister for Foreign Affairs was prevented by private reasons from attending; and in the end the King of Iraq was represented at the Coronation only by his Minister in London, who acted as special envoy. 104. Lest the nomination of Saiyid Rauf-al-Chadirji to be sole repre sentative might be regarded in England as discourteous or inadequate, Hikmat Sulaiman proposed that, if the idea appealed to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, the Minister should be raised to Ambassadorial rank for the period of the Coronation ceremonies. His Majesty’s Government replied that the reasons which made it impossibe to send a delegation were fully appreciated in London, and that there was no need for any special rank to be conferred on the Minister.20 mmm 105. At the request of His Majesty’s Ambassador, seats on the Coronation route were reserved for Shaikh Ajil, of the Shammar tribe, and some other prominent Iraqis. 106. His Majesty King Ghazi having unofficially expressed a wish to confer the Hashimite Order on The King, His Majesty’s Ambassador was instructed to inform the Iraqi Government that King George would be pleased to receive the order, but would prefer that it should be delivered through the Iraqi Minister in London some little time after the Coronation. British War Graves in Iraq. 107. Brigadier-General Sir Herbert Hart, the new Deputy Controller of the Imperial War Graves Commission for the Near East, visited Iraq in the early spring and attended, on the 2nd March at His Majesty’s Embassy, the second meeting of the Iraqi committee which was held under the chairmanship of His Majesty’s Ambassador—the other members present included the Air Officer Commanding, the acting head of the military mission and the adviser to the Ministry of the Interior. 108. Various matters were discussed and the principal decisions reached were as follows :— (i) 1 hat either Sir Herbert Hart or Captain Peek should be recommended for the post of secretary to the committee. (ii) That a schedule of the lands in Iraq used for war cemeteries, graves and memorials should be drawn up and kept at the Embassy in case it should be required by the Iraqi Government. (iii) That as no title had been acquired by the Imperial War Graves Commission to the Hindu and Moslem Cemeteries (Bagdad West), while land in that vicinity was likely to be built upon, these graves should be removed, if possible, to the Bagdad North Gate Cemeteries. (Captain Peek was instructed to approach the Indian Association and the Moslem authorities concerned and to enquire whether they saw any objection to the proposal, but though a favourable reply had been received from the former before the end of the year, nothing had been heard from the latter.) (iv) That the title to the Mosul Post-War Cemetery (registered in the name of the Imperial War Graves Commission) should remain unchanged and that an offer made by His Majesty’s consul at Mosul to administer it should be accepted. (v) That it was now desirable that steps should be taken to re-register in the name of the Lnited Kingdom and the Dominions the cemeteries and memorials registered in the name of the secretary of the Imperial War Graves Commission, and that a power of attorney should be given to Captain 1 eek to enable him to carry out the necessary formalities. Civil Procedure Convention. 1°9. During 1938 the provisions of the Anglo-Iraqi Civil Procedure Convention of July 1935 were extended to Scotland, Southern Rhodesia New Zeaiand and Australia (including the territories of Papua and Norfolk Island and the mandated territories of New Guinea and Nauru). His Maiestv’s Rmbassy were also m correspondence with the Foreign Office rekrdinV feasibility of extending the provisions of the convention to Palestine 0 g ^ Empire Air Mail Scheme. m Tu® Iraqi , Government made it clear by their general attitude throughout the year that they would not be willing to 'narticinate iu tL p • air mail scheme on the conditions originally proposed In December the V K 1 ”™ were authorised by His Majesty’s Government in the IWedT; L ^'ibassy more ? h 'i”o?. P hS it was hoped that they might consent to participate, and at the end of the veer a note explaining the nature of the new proposals to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs was under preparation. ^ 101 ^ oreign21 111. The inauguration of the Empire Air Mail Service in Octobei was preceded by a series of hitches resulting from the unexpected opposition ot the Iraqi Government to the proposed arrangement whereby flying-boats operating the service should alight on Lake Habbaniyah. The use of the lake was an essential part of the scheme, as it is the only piece of water between the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf on which machines can conveniently descend on the 1,000-mile stretch from sea to sea, which is too long to be covered m a single flight. 112. Although the scheme has been frequently discussed with successive Governments, no objection had previously been raised to the use of Lake Habbaniyah; and it was not until the Iraqi Government had failed to reply to several notes raising small points in connexion with the use of the lake and the carrying out of survey flights that His Majesty’s Ambassador suspected that something was amiss. Finally, as the result of semi-official enquiries, made in July, His Majesty’s Ambassador discovered that the Ministry of Defence was opposed to the whole principle of the use of Lake Habbaniyah by the air force. Sir Archibald Clark Kerr endeavoured to find out from the Prime Minister the nature of the suspicions behind the Government’s attitude, but discovered nothing but a muddle-headed idea that the scheme would somehow mean a strengthening of British air control over Iraq which, it was claimed, would be contrary to the spirit of the treaty. 113. Sir Archibald Clark Kerr pointed out to Hikmat Sulaiman that the scheme, which had been approved by successive Governments, was perfectly consistent with the treaty, and was in fact a commercial enterprise from which Iraq would draw many obvious advantages; he also dwelt on the irritation which would be caused in London by a last-minute refusal of the desired facilities. 114. Eventually, permission was grudgingly given for the first experimental flight. Special permission had to be obtained, however, for each of the two further test flights; and if Bekr Sidqi had not died it may be that permission for the regular service would have been indefinitely postponed. As it was, it was not until a few days before the time fixed for the inauguration of the regular service that general permission was finally accorded—on certain conditions—by the Jamil Madfai Cabinet. These conditions were as follows : — (1) That facilities should not be confined to Imperial Airways, but should be granted, if desired, to other air companies. (2) That the Iraqi Government should have the right of general supervision of the company’s arrangements at Habbaniyah, where duties imposed by Iraqi laws in force should be paid. (3) That permission to use the lake should be confined to civil flying-boats. (4) That the Iraqi Government should be put to no expense in respect of buoys, customs, buildings, &amp;c., and should have no responsibility in connexion with the water level of the lake. His Majesty’s Embassy pointed out that the question raised in clause (3) did not arise, as the Royal Air Force aeroplanes already have the right to alight on the lake; and the Iraqi Government admitted that this was so. 115. The flying-boat undertaking the first flight of the regular service left Southampton on the 3rd October and alighted at Lake Habbaniyah and at Basra on the 5th October. On the return flight it reached Basra on the 10th October and Lake Habbaniyah on the 11th October. Subsequent flights (making allowance for occasional variations due to weather conditions) continued to operate to an identical schedule weekly. United Kingdom. Iraqi Diplomatic Representation. 116. Rauf Chadirji took up his appointment as Iraqi Minister in London early in the year. 117. The retiring military attache not having been replaced, His Majesty’s Government expressed their regret at the suppression of this post, as the duties attaching to it were of a highly specialised nature, and could not be satisfactorily [16798] E * 222 performed by a layman. Although His Majesty’s Ambassador on several occasions urged that a military attache should be appointed, it was not until after the murder of Bekr Sidqi that, in August, one of the late general’s aides-de-camp, Lieutenant-Colonel Shakir-al-Wadi, was appointed to the post. It is understood that the main object of the appointment was to get him out of harm’s way, and ^ he was only left in London for two months, being replaced in October by Colonel Ismail Hakki Ibrahim, another of Bekr Sidqi’s favourites. Military Mission. 118. The contracts of ten members of the military mission expired during the year. Among those whose contracts expired were the Inspector-General of the Iraqi Army (Major-General Hay) and the Inspector of the Royal Iraqi Air Force (Wing Commander Howard-Williams). 119. The Iraqi Government expressed a wish for the appointment, in General Hay’s place, of Brigadier T. A. A. Wilson; but for various reasons, including the desirability of the post being held by an officer of the substantive rank of major-general, the War Office felt unable to comply with this request, and after an abortive proposal for the appointment of Major-General Lindsay, Major-General Hugo Watson, an infantry officer and graduate of the Staff College, with a record of active service on several fronts, was appointed to be Inspector-General and arrived at Bagdad at the end of March. 120. The Iraqi Government made difficulties about the acceptance of two of the officers (Colonel Lamb and Major Fripp) who were recommended to fill the vacancies in the military mission on the ground that they were members of the Indian army. These objections seemed illogical in view of the fact that the Government had themselves requested the appointment of Brigadier Wilson; but the latter’s name only seems to have been put forward because he was a personal acquaintance of Bekr Sidqi, and there can be no doubt that the prejudice felt in Iraq against the Indian army is deep-rooted and real. Indeed, Major-General Watson only succeeded in persuading the Ministry of Defence to withdraw their objection to the appointment of these two officers at the price of telling Bekr Sidqi that he would ask His Majesty’s Ambassador to recommend that they should be the last to be appointed from India. It was on this basis that the two appoint ments in question were made. 121. At this point it may be convenient to indicate in tabular form the changes which have taken place during 1938 in the cadre of the military mission:— Inspector-General .... Inspector Q.M.G.’s Branch Inspector of Artillery Inspector of Cavalry Inspector of Infantry Inspector of Infantry Inspector of Signals Inspector of Mechani cal Transport Inspector of Royal Iraq Air Force Asst.-Inspector of R.LA.F. Outgoing. Maj.-Gen. C. J. B. Hay Col. G. G. Waterhouse Maj. A. F. B. Cottrell .... Maj. J. B. Browne Maj. A. Low .... Maj. B. S. Challen Capt. W. G. L. Kennard Maj. G. A. Sims W/C E. L.

Capt. J. H. Jeffers. W/C C. S. D. Culley. F/Lt. W. S. Reed. Air Defence Force. 122. Throughout the period of Hikmat Sulaiman’s administration nothing was said about the creation of the special forces for the protection of the Royal Air Force air bases in Iraq, for which provision was made in article 5 of the annexure to the Treaty of Alliance of 1930. At the beginning of December, how ever, Taufiq-al-Suwaidi, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, informed the Ambas sador that he had been instructed by the Cabinet to reopen discussions with a viewto creating this force in a manner agreeable to both Governments concerned. Sir Archibald Clark Kerr reported this request to His Majesty’s Government and suggested that new proposals should be drawn up by the Air Ministry based on the results of the discussions which had taken place with Nuri-al-Said both in Bagdad and London during the spring and summer of 1936. This suggestion was still under consideration by His Majesty’s Government at the end of the year. The Purchase of Armaments in the United Kingdom. 123. When Hikmat Sulaiman assumed office one of his earliest requests to the Ambassador was that Great Britain should do her utmost to supply as speedily as possible the munitions which were required for the reorganisation of the army. The Ambassador undertook to do all that he could to help and asked for a detailed list of the material needed, to be given to him without delay. It was not, however, until the end of January that this was ready for transmission to His Majesty’s Government. It covered a wide field and included, in addition to aircraft, anti-aircraft guns, howitzers, field guns, machine guns, light auto matics, tanks (heavy and medium), armoured cars, and artillery and small arms ammunition. 124. His Majesty’s Government were able to offer delivery, within a reasonable period, of most of the important articles required, except medium tanks and anti-aircraft guns, provided that the Iraqi Government would agree, in most cases, to accept reconditioned material. The Iraqi Government, however, disliked reconditioned material and the Iraqi Minister in London was instructed to make representations to the Secretary of State which were clearly intended to prepare the way for purchases to be made from other countries. The diffi culties, arising mainly from Great Britain’s rearmament programme, which stood in the way of the speedy manufacture of new material (especially guns and light tanks) were thereupon explained both to the Iraqi Minister in London and to the Iraqi Government in Bagdad, and, as a concession to Iraqi insistence. His Majesty’s Government agreed that temporary derogations from the provisions of the Treaty of Alliance, i.e., that the armament of the Iraqi forces should not differ in type from that of the British forces, might be made if it were established that essential requirements could not be supplied in a reasonable time from the United Kingdom or India. Fortunately, about this time the Government of India were able to offer to supply from stock 18-pdr. guns and to manufacture the gun ammunition asked for by Iraq, and thereby they somewhat relieved the embarrassing situation which seemed to be developing. But even this offer gave rise to new difficulties. India could supply the guns, but not all of the smaller component parts, for many of which indents had to be sent to the United Kingdom. The Iraqis, reasonably enough, stipulated that they would only pay for complete and serviceable equipment, and, at the close of the year, though the first consignment of eight guns had been landed in Basra, the Ministry of Defence would not take them over or pay for them because sights and other parts had not by then been delivered from the United Kingdom. 125. In the meanwhile, from the beginning of the year, the German Legation, among others, had been pressing attractive offers of early deliveries and easy payments on the Ministry of Defence, and in April the Prime Minister admitted to the Ambassador that the Ministry wished to buy certain types of artillery in Germany. He was persuaded, however, to agree that, if similar weapons could be obtained from Great Britain on terms as good as those offered by the German firms concerned, he would give the orders to the United Kingdom instead. The assassination of Bekr Sidqi (in whose pocket it is said that orders to German firms for munitions to the value of £500,000 were found) put an end, however, to this chapter of the story and under Jamil-al-Madfai, the Ministry of Defence, though still pressing for their needs to be met quickly, became less exigent in their demands and ceased the flirtations with foreign manufacturers which had been encouraged under Hikmat Sulaiman’s regime. Nevertheless, the delays which are experienced in obtaining their military requirements from the United Kingdom are still a grievance in the Ministry of Defence, and a cause of suspicious criticism in many quarters. Iraqis often say openly that, with the vast resources of the British Empire, it cannot really be difficult for His Majesty’s [16798] E * 324 Government to supply out of hand the few guns or tanks for which the Iraqi Government ask, and they persist in their belief that the delays which occur are due to a desire to keep the Iraqi forces weak and ill-armed. 126. In addition to the 18-pdr. guns (sixteen) mentioned above, the Iraqi Government ordered the following artillery ammunition from India : i — ^ 5,000 rounds 3-7 howitzer ammunition. 1.500 rounds 4 -5 howitzer ammunition. 3.500 rounds 18-pdr. ammunition. Deliveries were promised at the rate of 1,000 rounds a week, starting six months from the receipt of the order, and, after some initial difficulties, terms of payment were settled which were satisfactory to both sides. 127. The original list of Iraqi requirements included ten 3 -7 howitzers, and the story of the response which was made to their request for these guns may help to an understanding of the irritation which the Ministry of Defence showed from time to time with His Majesty's Government about the arms question. In January ten new guns were asked for. The War Office offered seven reconditioned guns: four at the end of 1937 and three more during 1938. But the Iraqis wanted new guns, and in April hope was given them that these could be obtained at once from stock in India. A few weeks later, however, this hope was shattered by a telegram from India saying that, after all, no 3-7 equipments could be spared from stock, but that new ones could be manufactured by the end of 1939. The Iraqis showed keen disappointment, and, as these guns were urgently needed, this event was probably one of the main reasons for their willingness to turn to the Germans or to anyone else who seemed able to give them new arms quickly. How these overtures failed, through the murder of Bekr Sidqi in August, has already- been told, and in October the Ministry of Defence, in despair, accepted the War Office offer of seven reconditioned guns, asking, in addition, for thirteen new guns to be manufactured for them as soon as possible. But the chapter of difficulties was not yet closed. In December the War Office intimated that, owing to the heavy repairs found necessary after the seven guns had been brought from Hong Kong to the United Kingdom to be reconditioned, the best they could do was to deliver four guns about May 1938, and the balance of three in the winter of 1939. Delivery of the new guns could not be offered before July 1940. Thus, at the end of the year, after twelve months’ correspondence, the Iraqi Government had no prospect of obtaining any 3-7 guns until the middle of the following year, when four could be hoped for, and the three more guns urgently needed could not be expected before the winter of 1939. Purchase of Aircraft in the United Kingdom. 128. The plan of expansion for the Royal Iraqi Air Force—of which details are given elsewhere—included the creation of two fighter squadrons and one bomber squadron. 129. Negotiations were opened with the Air Ministry to supply the necessary aircraft, but, owing to the exigencies of the British rearmament programme, the best offer which His Majesty’s Government could make in respect of the fighter aircraft was the delivery of one squadron of fifteen modern “ Gladiator ” aero planes in instalments, beginning in the late summer and finishing at the end of the year. The offer was accepted. 130. Meanwhile. Mohammad Ali Jawad, the Director of the Iraqi Air Force, was sent to Europe in order to see what could be done about supplying Iraq with a squadron of fighters to fill the gap which must elapse before the delivery of the “Gladiators,” and also to negotiate for the purchase of the bomber aircraft required. 131. In his conversations at the Air Ministry in London in May, Mohammad Ali Jawad did not commit himself to a decision about the remaining aircraft, though he seemed interested in an offer to deliver twelve “ Blenheim ” bomber aeroplanes by October 1938, and promised to communicate it to his Government. On his way back to Iraq, however, he allowed himself to be inveigled into placing an order for Italian fighters and bombers (cf. paragraph 206 of this report), in support of which a cash advance was made. As the British “ Gladiators ”ordered by the Iraqi Government cost only £6,000 each, while the Italian “ Bredas,” which are in no way superior to them and are more difficult to handle, fetched the sum of £11,000 apiece, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that a certain amount of bribery and corruption was involved in this transaction. How ever that may be, when informing His Majesty’s Ambassador of the purchase of the Italian aeroplanes, Hikmat Sulaiman pleaded that, as the offers of aircraft made to Jawad in London had not satisfied the immediate needs of the Iraqi Government (the full complement of “ Gladiators ” not being due until the end of the year, while the ££ Blenheim ” bombers would not be ready till the end of 1938), the Iraqi Government had no choice but to accept the Italian offer of immediate delivery. 132. On the 25th June, the Ambassador, on instructions from His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, addressed a strong protest to the Iraqi Government against the manner in which this transaction had been con cluded. He pointed out that the fact that His Majesty’s Government were neither consulted nor informed beforehand was in complete variance with the spirit of the alliance, as it excluded any possibility of advice from His Majesty’s Govern ment. In conclusion, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr said that His Majesty’s Government expected the Iraqi Government to revert to the terms of the treaty as soon as adequate conditions of production were established in the United Kingdom. 133. Although considering that, on political grounds, every effort must be made to prevent Italian air personnel from obtaining a permanent footing in Iraq, His Majesty’s Government felt that they had no choice, as the aeroplanes had been ordered, but to acquiesce in the temporary employment of a small number of Italian (civilian) mechanics, whose assistance was necessary for technical reasons. In November Taufiq-al-Suwaidi told Sir Archibald Clark Kerr that he quite understood the reasons for the dislike felt by His Majesty’s Government to the idea of a permanent Italian air mission coming to Iraq, and assured him that the Iraqi Government did not wish to employ any but British experts or instructors in their air force, and that they readily accepted the British point of view in this matter. The Loan. 134. It has already been related that, so soon as he came into office, Hikmat Sulaiman begged the Ambassador to do all he could to help him to obtain arms for the army and money with which to finance the reproductive works and works of development which he wished to undertake with all possible speed. The story of the difficulties encountered in trying to provide the Iraqi army with modern weapons has been told, and it remains to give an account of the efforts made to find the money needed for the Government’s programme of works. The chief items in their programme were roads, bridges and buildings (£1,300,000), and the railway extensions Baiji-Mosul-Tel Kotchek (£1,750,000), to which had to be added a probable liability for several hundred thousand pounds for the canalisa tion of the Kut Barrage scheme. One of Hikmat Sulaiman’s first acts as Prime Minister was to open the work of the railway extension, and money was soon urgently needed to pay for the material required to construct the line. The Iraqi Government were advised that the best plan was to float a loan in the City of London and, although some members of the Cabinet were not well disposed in principle to borrowing, tentative negotiations were opened with Baring’s in December 1936, and were continued in 1937, with the approval of His Majesty’s Government. By April general agreement in principle had been reached for a loan of £3 million at an interest of 4 per cent., to be issued in instalments of £1 million each and to be secured on the oil royalties received from the Iraq Petro leum Company, and Mr. Hogg, the adviser to the Ministry of Finance, left Bagdad before the end of the month to settle details in London. After this, correspon dence between Baring’s and the Ministry of Finance proceeded so satisfactorily that by June all important points had been settled for a 4 per cent, loan to be issued at 97^ and purchaseable by Baring’s at 94J, and the Iraqi Government were talking of increasing the total to 5 million or 6 million by a further issue of bonds in the autumn. By the end of June all the documents were ready, and the Government had prepared a Bill for Parliament authorising them to borrow £3 million and to issue State bonds for this amount. At this point, however, a [16798] E * 4serious hitch occurred. The Iraq Petroleum Company indicated that they could not accept a letter which, as part of the security arrangements, it had been pro posed that the Iraqi Government should write to the company instructing them to pay to Baring’s each year, from the royalties due to the Iraqi Government, the sum required to make good the interest and redemption charges of the loan, and for a while it seemed that the whole scheme would fall through at the last moment. The Prime Minister told the Ambassador that, unless a way could be found out of the difficulty, he would be forced to approach some other foreign Government for help. He pointed out that, in confident expectation of financial help from the United Kingdom, the Iraqi Government had entered into serious commitments, and the possibility of the breakdown of the loan negotiations faced them with a most difficult situation. 135. Urgent representations were made to His Majesty’s Government for assistance to find a solution to the problem, and on the 20th July, Baring’s telegraphed an offer to issue bonds immediately for £1 million at 4J per cent, which they would themselves buy at 87-2- an d issue at 93. By this time the approach of the summer holidays had made time a vital factor, if the loan was to be issued before the autumn, and the Iraqi Government were given only three days in which to decide whether to accept or reject the offer. Their heavy commitments really left them little choice and they accepted, though protesting bitterly against the unfavourable terms offered. In the end market conditions in the City improved slightly, and Baring’s were able to put the bonds on the market at 94 and to increase their price to the Iraqi Government to 90|, the interest remaining at 4^ per cent. The difficulty with the Iraq Petroleum Company was overcome by a provision in the general agreement which provided that the Iraqi Government should inform the company that the bonds had been secured by a first charge on the royalties payable to the Government, but no acknowledgment was required from the company. 136. The Iraqi Government were keenly disappointed that the original terms had to be departed from, and in spite of the Ambassador’s reiterated explanations of the position of His Majesty’s Government in the transaction they were left with the feeling that the British had failed to do what they had expected of them and were very sore. All idea of raising the remaining £2 million of the loan of £3 million originally contemplated was at once dropped, nor did the Government formed by Jamil-al-Madfai in August make any attempt to hide their dislike of embarking on any further financial adventures in the London market. British Officials. 137. Mr. H. H. Wheatley, British adviser to the Ministry of Economics and Communications, who had been in the Iraqi Government service for seventeen years, resigned his appointment in May. He had not been replaced by the end of the year. J 138. On several occasions during the year, the Iraqi Government showed sings of wanting to engage a really competent irrigation engineer to study major irrigation problems m Iraq, and several persons, including an Egyptian expert [cf. section 171 of this report) were suggested as likely candidates In October Mr. R M Macgregor, the former Sudan irrigation expert, offered to visit Iraq for a short while, with no remuneration other than his travelling expenses in order to examine the general irrigation problem and advise the Iraqis how best to cope with it; and at the end of the year it seemed probable that the Iraqi Government would close with this offer. 4 13 9 The Iraqi Government have been disturbed for some time by a real or fancied deterioration in the quality of British officials recruited for service with the Iraqi Health Department. Importance is attached by the Irani Govern ment to the appearance, manner and personality of the candidates as well as to their professional attainments, and some of the more recent recruits are said to have fallen considerably short of the standard required. 6 d 140 ' Jn July the matter was raised with His Maiesty’s Ambassador hv tt.e Minister of the Interior, Mustafa-al-Umari, who said that he regretted d tlJkore to hear so many complaints about British doctors because their reputation had27 once stood high in Iraq. In spite of the complaints, it was intended, he added, to appoint British subjects to three posts which would shortly require filling, but he begged that Sir Archibald Clark Kerr would see that great care was taken to secure the appointment of men who were in every way suitable for the vacant professorships. 141. His Majesty’s Ambassador, who promised to offer all the assistance in his power, pointed out that the practice adopted at present (whereby the Iraqi Legation in London advertised for doctors in the medical press and made a choice from among the applicants) gave His Majesty’s Government no opportunity either to suggest candidates or to offer advice. Sir Archibald Clark Kerr suggested that a better plan would be for all nominations to be made in London by an official committee, to be called together for the purpose. 142. As this idea appealed to the Minister and to the Directorate of Health, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr mentioned it to the Foreign Office, who agreed that, at any rate as regards the next batch of candidates, they would be willing to help the Iraqi Government, and arranged with the Colonial Office and Health Ministry for the formation of a suitable selection committee. In November an official note from the Iraqi Government requested that the three specialists might be recruited as early as possible, and stated that the Iraqi Legation had been requested to co-operate with the Foreign Office in this matter. 143. In August the Iraqi Government applied for a successor to Mr. Wheldon in his capacity as headmaster of the technical school. It was explained that they required a man of practical rather than theoretical bent, with up-to-date knowledge of industrial matters, previous experience in the administration of technical schools, and a knowledge of continental methods of instruction. In the autumn, His Majesty’s Government suggested as a candidate Mr. G. E. Hutchings, of the Kent Education Committee, who appeared to possess nearly all of the qualifications mentioned; and it seems probable that he will be accepted by the Iraqi Government, although possibly under the condition that he shall first be employed on trial for a year. So far as can be ascertained, the Iraqi Government have at present no intention of engaging an expert, either British or foreign, to occupy the other (and more important) of the two positions vacated by Mr. Wheldon, viz., that of Adviser in Technical Education. In fact this post would appear to be extinct. 144. Three more teachers were brought out from the United Kingdom to teach English in the secondary schools. A physical training expert from Great Britain was also engaged at the request of the Ministry of Education. 145. In the autumn of 1936 the Minister for Foreign Affairs had expressed a desire for the loan of the services of a member of the clerical staff of the Foreign Office to advise on the organisation of the clerical establishment and the archives of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. In view of the desirability, on political grounds, of securing the highest possible degree of efficiency in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, His Majesty’s Government decided that it would be expedient to comply with this request and, suitable terms having been arranged, Mr. H. K. Grey was seconded for service with the Iraqi Government for a period of four months and arrived in Bagdad in September. At the end of the year, the work of reorganisation, which is being carried out under his supervision at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, was proceeding satisfactorily. Insurance Companies Law. 146. This law, which had passed in 1936, contained certain undesirable features, and His Majesty’s Embassy reminded the Iraqi Government that amending legislation had been promised, notably to regularise the position of Lloyd’s underwriters. No Bill to amend the existing law was, however, brought forward. Towards the end of the year, the Ministry of Finance requested the insurance companies to transfer their deposits to Bagdad (in the case of United Kingdom insurance companies, these deposits, by arrangement with the Ministry of Finance, had been made in the form of British Government securities deposited with the London offices of banks operating in Iraq). When it was ascertained ‘I \ Mlthat this demand did not involve a change in the form of the deposit, but merely concerned the actual repository of the bonds, the companies decided to comply, and the transfer of the bonds to the Bagdad offices of the bank was effected. Customs Duties on Iraqi Dates. 147. No progress was made during the year with the negotiations held with a view to removing or reducing the customs dues charged in the United Kingdom and India on imported Iraqi dates. On the 20th December, 1936, His Majesty’s Government authorised His Majesty’s Ambassador to conclude an agreement whereby such concessions on the part of the United Kingdom should be balanced by certain modifications in the Iraqi customs regulations designed to favour the United Kingdom trade in cotton textiles and automobiles. His Majesty’s Ambassador, however, did not feel that he could well take the first step and as, from exploratory conversations with officials of the Iraqi Customs and Ministry of Finance, it was clear that the Iraqi Government had lost interest in the matter, it remained in abeyance throughout the year. Telej)hone Service. 148. The opening of a telephone service between Iraq and Great Britain took place on the 1st September without much ceremony. Ahmad Zaki, Director- General of Posts and Telegraphs, however, spoke to the Postmaster-General in London, and various conversations followed—including one between the editor of the Iraq Times and the foreign editor of the Times. In Iraq the service is restricted to Bagdad. Iraqi Visitors to the United Kingdom. 149. The Mayor of Bagdad, Arshad-al-Umari, visited the United Kingdom in August under the auspices of the Ministry of Health and the Department of Overseas Trade. A detailed programme was arranged for him during two days, and he was entertained to luncheon by the Comptroller-General of the Department of Overseas Trade. The mayor appears to have been genuinely pleased and impressed by his visit. 150. Among other distinguished Iraqis who visited the United Kingdom during the year were Mohammad Ali Jawad, the Director of the Royal Iraqi Air Force (subsequently murdered), Rashid Ali (the former Minister of the Interior), who was invited to one of their Majesties’ garden parties, and the Minister of Defence, Abdul Latif Nuri. It had been hoped to arrange for the latter to be received in audience by His Majesty the King, but the general’s state of health did not permit the realisation of this plan. British Council. 151. The British Council made a grant of £750 for the year 1937, which was spent on : — (a) English book prizes for Iraqi secondary schools (£50). \h) A gift of books to the Royal Medical College (£100). (c) Bursaries enabling two Iraqi teachers to take a year’s English course at the universities of Exeter and Southampton (£300 each). The British Council, moreover, presented four sets of linguaphone records to the Ministry of Education for use as an aid to the teaching of English in Iraqi schools. The British Council have undertaken to make an even more generous grant for 1938. Commonwealth of Australia. 152. In connexion with the celebrations to be held at Sydney early in 1938 to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the foundation of Australia, the New South Wales Government expressed the desire that the Governments of foreign countries might be approached with a view to presenting a national flag and addressing to the Government and people of New South Wales a message of goodwill appropriate to the occasion. Having been informed by His Majesty’s Ambassador of this desire, the Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed a cordialmessage, together with a flag, to the Premier of New South Wales, who replied, through the Embassy, thanking the Iraqi Government for their gift and warmly reciprocating the friendly sentiments expressed by Dr. Naji-al-Asil. India. Pilgrims. 153. Early in the year the Iraqi Government informed His Majesty’s Embassy that they were, after all, willing (cf. paragraph 165 of the report for 1936) that the amount of the deposits paid by pilgrims to the Hejaz by the overland route should remain unchanged. These deposits at present amount to I.D. 8 for pilgrims with return tickets and I.D. 18 for those without. 154. In November, however, the Government of India forwarded to His Majesty’s Embassy a resolution by the Bombay Port Haj Committee, whereby it was suggested that a reduction should be made in both amounts. After careful consideration His Majesty’s Ambassador informed the Viceroy in December that he did not feel able to recommend the reduction of the basic deposit of I.D. 8 which—however rarely drawn upon—remained a valuable cover for expenditure incurred on the repatriation of destitute pilgrims. He added, however, that it might, in his opinion, be equitable to reduce the additional charge of I.D. 10. No decision in the matter had, however, been reached at the close of the year. 155. In August the Ministry for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty’s Embassy that the Iraqi authorities had discovered that many Indians, whose real object of entry was to settle in the country, entered Iraq on pilgrim passes. The Government of India, to whom the matter was reported, accordingly took steps with a view to obtaining from applicants for pilgrim passes a guarantee, if necessary in the form of a security bond, that they would return to India on the completion of their pilgrimage. 156. It was learned during the year that pilgrim passes would be revised by the Government of India in such a way as to make them valid for the Hejaz in the case of pilgrims proceeding thither by way of Iraq as well as by the alternative routes. Pilgrims continued to arrive at the end of the year, however, without such endorsements. The Late Mir of Khairpur. 157. The remains of His late Highness the Mir of Khairpur, who died in December 1935, were brought to Iraq in February for burial at Karbala. At the request of the Government of India the Iraqi Government arranged for official salutes to be given on arrival of the body at Basra and also at Karbala : and the funeral arrangements made by the authorities appear to have been both adequate and dignified. Treaty Relations. 158. In April and May an exchange of notes took place between His Majesty’s Ambassador and the Iraqi Prime Minister (Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs) regarding the extension to India of the Extradition Treaty of the 2nd May, 1932, between the United Kingdom and Iraq. The chief consequence of the accession, which took place on the 5th April, would seem to be that the requisition for the surrender of a fugitive criminal who has taken refuge in India must henceforth be addressed to the Government of India and not to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. Indian Interest in the Karbala Shrine. 159. In November His Majesty’s Ambassador received from the Govern ment of India—for such action as seemed appropriate—a copy of a petition which had been addressed to them by the secretary of the All-India Shiah Conference at Lucknow, referring to the demolition (on grounds of safety) of the Kashi Minaret of the shrine of the Imam Husain at Karbala, and enquiring whether any steps were being taken to rebuild it. His Majesty’s Ambassador passed on the petition to the Minister for Foreign Affairs with a letter in which he emphasised the devotion felt by the Jafariyah community in India for the shrines in Iraq, and requested information as to the intentions of the Iraqi authorities regarding the minaret. No reply had been received by the end of the year.30 ■■ Arya Samaj. 160. During the summer of 1936 the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Nuri-al- Said, had promised His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires that the Arya Samaj (a Hindu religious body) would be allowed to build a temple on a piece of land which they had bought for the purpose in Bagdad West (cf. paragraph 167 of the report for 1936). In January, however, Naji-al-Asil told His Majesty’s Ambassador that the Ministry of the Interior were making difficulties about the fulfilment of Nuri’s promise, which, they said, might result in attacks being made on the Government on religious grounds. There would have been no difficulty if the Arya Samaj had only wanted a club, but the word “ temple ” always suggested Idolatry and angered devout Moslems. As it seemed unwise to use the subterfuge of building a temple while calling it a club, the society had no choice but to abandon the idea of building, and it is understood that they contemplate selling the site which they bought for the purpose. Smuggling of Tea. 161. In April the Iraqi Government informed His Majesty’s Embassy that it had come to their notice that tea was being illicitly exported from India (and Ceylon via India) to Koweit, whence it was imported openly to Iraq after the payment of the usual customs dues. His Majesty’s Embassy, in referring the question to Delhi and Colombo, suggested that an end could be put to the traffic if the Governments of India and Ceylon issued certificates of origin in respect of all tea exported to Iraq. Both India and Ceylon replied that it would be preferable that the Iraqi Government should require, in respect of all tea imported into Iraq from either country, certificates of lawful exportation, and it was proposed that these certificates should take the form of export licences granted by the India Tea Licensing Committee, or certified copies thereof. The proposals were passed on to the Iraqi Government in November, but no indication as to whether they would be adopted or not had been received by His Majesty’s Embassy at the end of the year. Palestine and Transjordan. Arabic Broadcasts. 162. In order that the British view on current events at home and abroad might be more adequately presented to the inhabitants of the Near and Middle East, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom decided in the summer to make fuller use of the facilities offered by the wireless station at Jerusalem for the broadcasting of news in Arabic. The new service came into operation in September, it was further extended in November; and at the end of the year two Arabic news bulletins were being broadcast daily from Jerusalem, one at 8 p.m. and one at 10-45 p.m. (Bagdad time). The Palestine broadcasts would appear to serve a useful purpose because they supply trustworthy news in the language of the country, and the inclusion in them of items of Iraqi news certainly enhances their popularity. Customs Agreement. 163. The Iraq-Palestine Customs Agreement, signed at Bagdad on the 14th December, 1936, came into force on the 14th February and was simultaneously published on the 20th February in Iraq and Palestine. In April, at the urgent request of the Palestine Government, the Iraqi authorities consented, as an exceptional measure, to waive their right to six months’ notice of certain tariff changes (in connexion with the import of poultry and eggs) which it was considered essential to bring about without delay. In July the Iraqi Government suggested that the concessions made under the Special Customs Agreement to Iraqi products imported into Palestine by the Bagdad-Haifa route should be extended to goods despatched to Palestine from Mosul via the direct route through Syria. This suggestion having been referred to the Government of Palestine, the latter found it°necessary to consult His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom; and no decision in the matter had been reached at the close of the year. Iraqi Consular Representation. ' 164. Early in the year the Iraqi Government informed His Majesty’s Embassy that they wished to transfer the place of residence of their consularrepresentative in Palestine from Haifa to Jerusalem and to make his consular district conterminous with Palestine. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Palestine Government having agreed to these proposals, the new arrangements were brought into force before the end of the year. Deportations to Transjordan. 165. Owing to difficulties caused by the deportation to Transjordan from Iraq of persons of a third nationality, the Amman authorities decided in August to refuse entry into Transjordan of all persons of other than Transjordan nationality in respect of whose journey to their country of origin adequate arrangements had not been made by the Iraqi Government. A fghanistan. 166. As stated in paragraph 189 of this report, Afghanistan was one of the co-signatories with Iraq of the Middle Eastern Pact of Non-Aggression (Treaty of Sa’adabad) signed at Tehran on the 8th July. Egypt. Egypt and the League of Nations. 167. In February, as the result of a hint from the Egyptian Government that such a gesture on the part of other Middle Eastern States would be welcome, the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs sent a letter to Cairo cordially inviting the Egyptian Government to make early application for admission to membership of the League of Nations. Dr. Naji also sent a letter to the Secretary-General of the League on the subject. Much gratification is said to have been felt in Egypt at this action on the part of Iraq, the first Arab country to secure independence. Pleasure was felt and expressed in Iraq at the election of Egypt as a member at the special session of the Assembly held on the 26th May. Proposed Iraqi-Egyptian Alliance. 168. The Minister for Foreign Affairs told His Majesty’s Ambassador in January that the Iraqi Chargd d’Affaires had been instructed to sound the Egyptian Government regarding the possibility of an alliance between Iraq and Egypt. The idea underlying this proposal was that, as Egypt and Iraq were now both allies of Great Britain, it was appropriate and desirable that they too should be allies. Dr. Naji, who said that the Egyptian Government had given the proposal a favourable reception, explained that he had a special bilateral instru ment in mind and not merely accession by Egypt to the Saudi-Iraqi treaty. He suggested that the treaty might be on the lines of the Pacte d Entente balkanique.” Dr. Naji asked what the views of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom were likely to be and in due course Sir Archibald Clark Kerr was instructed to state (if the matter were raised again) that the attitude of His Majesty’s Government was one of general goodwill towards any proposal for strengthening bonds between their allies. At the same time they hoped that they would be closely consulted during negotiations and given an opportunity, as in the case of the Saudi-Iraqi treaty, to suggest amendments to the draft of any proposed instrument. No further allusion was, however, made to the matter by any responsible Iraqi. The Egyptian Minister, to whom the proposal of an alliance had generally been attributed (by Dr. Naji, among others), said that it had actually originated with Nuri Pasha, and that he himself felt that Egypt stood to gain little by such an alliance, though, if brought into being, it might increase Iraq’s prestige in the Middle East and thereby indirectly benefit Great Britain. Egyptian Officials. 169. The tendency on the part of the Iraqi Government to turn to Egypt for assistance in technical and educational matters {cf. paragraph 177 of the report for 1936) continued to be very noticeable. 170. Dr. Abdul Hamid Mutawalli, who came to Bagdad in 1936 as professor of constitutional law, was made acting principal of the Bagdad Law College in place of Dr. Sanhuri; Dr. Mahmud Azmi, a noted Arabic scholar, who32 was at one time suspected, apparently without reason, of being an Italian agent, was appointed professor of economics; while the services of Muhammad Mustafa-al-Mahi, of the Egyptian Waqf, were obtained to advise on the reform of the Waqf Department. His Majesty’s Ambassador, who was consulted about these appointments, felt that they were justified on the ground that the posts in ^ question demanded a good knowledge of Arabic, while the salaries offered were too small to attract fully qualified British professors. 171. In April the Egyptian Government, knowing that the Iraqi Govern ment were contemplating the engagement of an irrigation expert, offered to lend the services of Ahmed Raghib Bey of the Egyptian Ministry of Public Works, free of charge. The Iraqi Government, who knew that His Majesty’s Government would wish to be consulted about a matter of this kind, and were not certain in any case that Ahmed Raghib would suit their purpose, seemed embarrassed by the offer, but agreed to the expert’s coming to Iraq in June on a tour of inspection. He made wholesale criticisms during his short visit and announced his intention on departure of returning in the autumn with four Egyptian engineers; but nothing more had been heard of him at the end of the year and it looks as though all idea of employing him had been dropped (cf. paragraph 138). France. 172. The French Minister, M. Paul Lepissier, was transferred to Bangkok, and left Bagdad in October for his new post. No successor has yet been appointed. 173. There were rumours that the Iraqi Government v ould abolish the post of Minister in Paris and leave the Legation permanently in the hands of a Charge d'Affaires, but nothing had been decided at the end of the year. 174. An unofficial visit was paid to Bagdad in April by the High Com missioner for Syria, the Comte de Martel. As this visit happened to coincide with that of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia {cf. paragraph 228), the Turkish Minister, influenced by irresponsible rumours in the press, felt uneasy lest M. Martel’s object in coming to Bagdad had been to concert Arab resistance to Turkish demands regarding Alexandretta. His unfounded suspicions were, however, successfully allayed by Dr. Naji-al-Asil. 175. Abdul Aziz-al-Mudhaffar, the counsellor to the Iraqi Legation in Paris, who had abused his position by selling false arms certificates to a Spanish gun-running organisation, and is said to have made some £50,000 thereby, was dismissed from his post in April and arrested on arrival at Beirut by the French authorities. An official Iraqi demand for his extradition was, however, refused by the French authorities in the Lebanon and, after a short time, Mudhaffar was released. The Iraqi Government of the time were so incensed at what they considered to be the disobliging attitude of the French authorities in this matter that they talked of withdrawing their Minister in Paris and their consul-general at Beirut by way of protest. Wiser counsels prevailed, however, and towards the end of the year it was announced that the charges brought against Mudhaffar, who now had relatives in high places, were to be dropped and that he would soon return to Iraq. 176. With a view to strengthening cultural relations between Iraq and France, the French Ministry of Education presented to the Iraqi Government a quantity of books on science, history and literature, of the approximate value of 40,000 fr., to be distributed in accordance with the wishes of the Iraqi educational authorities. Germany. General Relations. 177. In the earlier part of the year a significant tightening of relations with Germany took place. This was due, no doubt, to the influence which the German Minister had succeeded in establishing over the Chief of the General Staff, partly, it is thought, through the agency of the latter’s Viennese wife. Dr. Grobba succeeded, by fair means or foul, in persuading the Chief of the General Staff to embark on large schemes of arms purchase in Germany by offering the immediate delivery of aeroplanes and early delivery of arms and ammunition of British types% which would, if necessary, be specially manufactured, and Bekr Siiiqi was on his way to Europe to negotiate these purchases when the assassin’s bullet at Mosul put an end to his schemes. On the 16th August Dr. Naji told His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires that, since Bekr Sidqi’s death, the Government had cancelled orders for £500,000, which were to have been placed chiefly with Krupp s, whose representative had been in Iraq for six months. Arms Traffic Scandal. 178. In April it was discovered that the Iraqi Legation in Berlin (acting presumably on behalf of a Spanish gun-running organisation) had been receiving arms from a Danish firm in return for false certificates to the effect that the material was required in Iraq. The counsellor of the Legation, Musa-al- Shabandar, was recalled to Iraq and arrested on arrival, but, when photostatic copies of the documents in the case were received by the Iraqi Government (having been obtained through the Danish Legation in London), the signature on one of the two documents appeared to be that of the Amir Zaid, Iraqi Minister in Berlin and uncle of King Ghazi. This embarrassing fact gave fresh importance to the affair, though the view generally taken was that the Amir's signature was a forgery, and His Royal Highness, after a hurried visit to Bagdad, returned to his post. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs asked for the help of His Majesty’s Government in finding an expert investigator to be sent out to Berlin, but this was not found possible. Towards the end of the year, Musa-al-Shabandar (who had been under remand for eight months) was acquitted of the charge brought against him, and the full circumstances of the forgery will probably never be brought to light. German Aviation. 179. In connexion with the desire of the Luft-Hansa to operate a mail and passenger service from Germany to the Far East, permission was obtained from the Iraqi Government in April for the aeroplanes operating this service to fly over this country; the projected route being by way of Greece, Syria, Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan. 180. The Luft-Hansa air liner inaugurating the service arrived at Bagdad in August. When questioned as to its ultimate destination, the German Minister at Tehran, who was a passenger, and the pilot would not commit themselves to any statement. Actually, an attempt was made to reach China, but the mishap which befell the machine in Sinkiang, where the airmen (who were thought to be lost) were stranded for several weeks, is believed to have brought home vividly to the German Government the perilous nature of the route adopted; and it seems possible that the Luft-Hansa, if they decide to pursue the idea of a Far Eastern service, may abandon the Afghanistan route and give favourable consideration to a provisional offer of facilities for flight over India which has been made to them by His Majesty’s Government. 181. German military aircraft, as Dr. Grobba admitted to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires in August, did not seem to find favour in the eyes of the Iraqi air experts, who visited Europe in the early summer. Hungary. 182. The Hungarian Government, having decided that their representative at Angora should also be accredited to Bagdad and Tehran, M. Zoltan de Mariassy came to Bagdad, and in the course of a short visit presented his letters of credence as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of the Magyar Kingdom. M. de Mariassy is the first Hungarian Minister to be accredited to Bagdad. It is understood that a trade agreement between the two countries has been drawn up and will shortly be signed. Iran. Frontier Question. 183. The new direction which had been given by the Iraqi Government’s note of November 1936 (see paragraph 194 of the report for 1936) to the negotia tions regarding the Iraqi-Iranian frontier dispute, resulted, before the summer of 1937 was over, in the conclusion of a frontier treaty between the two countries.184. The unexpectedly favourable reply of Iran (which was received in January) to the above-mentioned note, first brought a solution of the frontier question within sight, and the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs at once proposed that the two notes should be regarded as forming the basis for a final settlement. Drafts and counter-drafts passed between Bagdad and Tehran, and the advice of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom was regularly asked tor and obtained by the Iraqi Government concerning them. 185. Unfortunately, Dr. Naji’s judgment was to some extent clouded by his desire to obtain as early a settlement as possible, and no serious attempt was maxle to obtain the adoption by Iran of certain provisions recommended by His Majesty’s Government, which, if included, would have clearly safeguarded in many respects the common interests of Iraq and Great Britain, and would have resulted in the avoidance of difficulties of interpretation to which the treaty, as signed, is likely to give rise. 186. The treaty, which was signed at Tehran on the 4th July, provided for the recognition by both parties of the frontier delimited in 1914, with a modifica tion at Abadan, were Iran was given an anchorage about 4 miles m length and extending in width from the left bank to the thalwsg of the bhatt-al-Arab. Ine treaty also stipulated that the Shatt-al-Arab should remain open to the merehant- ships of all nations and to the warships of the two conti acting parties. It had been hoped by His Majesty’s Government that it would have been found possible to embody in the treaty an explicit recognition of the right of British warships to pass along any part of the Shatt-al-Arab. Iranian opposition to such a provision was, however, obstinate, and the most that it was found possible to obtain was an article providing that the Iraqi right of user throughout the whole course of the Shatt should not be prejudiced by the cession of the Abadan anchorage. This article can be interpreted as covering the right of British ships, with the agreement of the Iraqi Government, to pass through any part of the Shatt-al-Arab between Basra and the open sea. 187. In the fifth article of the treaty, the two Governments agreed that they would conclude a convention concerning the maintenance and improvement of the navigable channel, dredging, navigation dues, quarantine and the prevention of smuggling. A protocol appended to the treaty stipulated that the convention in question should be concluded within a year from the date of the ratification of the Frontier Treaty. At the same time the Iranian Government agreed that, during this period, the Iraqi Government should continue to control the services already organised (by the Port Directorate at Basra) to deal with the matters included in the convention. The protocol contains provision for the prolongation, by mutual consent, of the period stated. The defect of this article is that, if a convention has not been concluded within the time stipulated, the Iraqi Govern ment will not be able to continue the services of the Shatt-al-Arab in the present manner without the consent of the Iranian Government. 188. When the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs visited Bagdad in November, Taufiq-al-Suwaidi discussed with him tentatively the manner in which negotiations for the conclusion of a convention could best be opened. Taufiq explained to M. Samii that the Iraqi Government wished, if possible, to negotiate the convention before the Frontier Treaty came before Parliament, as he feared that, if this was not done, difficulties might be made about ratification. M. Samii, who was vague about the form which the convention should take, though he made it clear that Iran would be unwilling to accept any idea of participation by His Majesty’s Government, thereupon took the line that the matter was one of no urgency, as Iran would be willing for the status quo (i.e., the arrangements whereby the Iraqi Government are responsible for the services in the Shatt) to continue indefinitely. Pressed, however, to confirm these assurances in writing, M. Samii refused to do so, subsequently explaining to His Majesty’s Ambassador that any written undertaking would annoy the Shah, who thought that everything has been settled already. In these circumstances the Iraqi Government, con sidering that an oral undertaking was of little value, sent instructions to their Minister at Tehran to endeavour to obtain the agreement of the Iranian Govern ment to an exchange of notes (to be ratified with the treaty itself), providing that, in all circumstances, the existing services of the Shatt should be maintained until the convention came into force.35 Four-Power Pact {Treaty of Sa’adabad). 189. The settlement of the Iranian frontier dispute removed the last obstacle felt by the Iraqi Government to the conclusion of the Pact of Non-Aggression between the four Middle Eastern Powers—Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Afghanistan; 4k and on the 8th July the pact, which received the name of the Treaty of Sa’adabad, was signed at the Sa’adabad Palace by the Foreign Ministers of the four countries, who had met at Tehran for the purpose. 190. The text was identical (except for the modifications needed to make it include Afghanistan) with that initialled at Geneva in October 1935, and con tained promises by each country to abstain from interference in the internal affairs of the others; to respect the inviolability of each other’s frontiers; and to enter into consultation about all international conflicts affecting their common interests. Thus the obligations to which the pact committed the contracting parties were almost negative in character, and its chief importance, from the point of view of the signatories, was that it showed their desire for fraternisation and good relations in the future. From a broader point of view, as Dr. Aras pointed out on a later occasion, the treaty may, moreover, be expected to restrict, by the area of the four contracting States, the field for speculation left open to the exponents of power politics in the world to-day. 191. Another section of this report {cf. paragraph 237) gives particulars of the protocol signed immediately after the Sa’adabad Pact, whereby arrangements were made for a permanent “ Council of the Eastern Entente ” to be set up and for support to be given by the other three Powers to Iran’s candidature to a seat on the Council of the League. 192. His Majesty’s Ambassador had been instructed in December 1935 to inform the Iraqi Government that it would be desirable that, when the Four- Power Pact was signed, some form of unilateral declaration should be made to the effect that the Iraqi Government considered the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930 to be one of the “other treaties to which the signatory Powers were parties” mentioned in the pact. No written declaration was, in fact, made, but on his return from Tehran, Dr. Naji-al-Asil assured the Ambassador that he had made an oral statement in the sense desired. In reply to a request from Sir Archibald Clark Kerr for further particulars, Taufiq Suwaidi in December informed him in writing that his predecessor had, upon signing the pact, declared that the Anglo- Iraqi Treaty was among those to which allusion is made therein. Other Treaties. 193. As well as the Middle-Eastern Pact of Non-Aggression and the Frontier Treaty, the following two treaties were signed by Dr. Naji-al-Asil at Tehran :— (1) A Treaty of Friendship (signed on the 18th July) and (2) A Treaty for the Pacific Settlement of Disputes (signed on the 23rd July). Both treaties followed conventional lines, though the last-named contained one unusual feature in the shape of a provision {cf. article 20) for the application of the instrument as between the two contracting parties, “ even when a third Power had an interest in the dispute.” It seems possible that this article was included in anticipation of difficulty arising out of the attitude of His Majesty’s Govern ment towards the future regime in the Shatt-al-Arab. 194. The most far-reaching clause in the Treaty of Friendship was that, whereby both Governments undertook to conclude treaties and conventions dealing with— Neighbourly relations; Residence and nationality; Commerce; Judicial assistance; Consular status; Posts and telegraphs,36 Article 2 dealt with the reciprocal grant of privileges and immunities to the diplomatic representatives of the two countries, but made no reservation xegai ding the special precedence accorded to His Majesty’s Ambassador in Bagdad by the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance of 1930. This point was raised by His Majesty s Embassy with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and, in November, Taufiq-al- £ Suwaidi informed His Majesty’s Ambassador that a note had been sent to the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs drawing attention to the special position enjoyed by the Ambassador in virtue of the Treaty of 1930. The Iranian Government replied that, although they could not, in principle, recognise this arrangement, they would not, for the duration of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, raise the status of the Iranian Legation at Bagdad. Visit of Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs. 195. While at Geneva in September, Taufiq-al-Suwaidi invited the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs to pay an official visit to Iraq on his way back to Tehran. M. Samii accepted the invitation and arrived on the 5th November at Bagdad, where he spent six days. He was accommodated in the Koyal Palace, and the customary entertainments, to which were added a Ramadhan supper with the King of Iraq, took place in his honour. Frontier Raids. 196. On the 27th May the Iranian Minister presented a strongly-worded note to the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs protesting against the alleged activities of brigands, who were said to be using the Kurdish frontier districts as a base for armed incursions into Iranian territory. The note, which went so far as to suggest that the Iraqi Government had been extending financial assistance to the bandits, gave great offence, and elicited a reply which expressed indignation at the Iranian attitude and made counter-allegations against their frontier authorities. In the Iraqi view, the Iranian note was the result of an ,incident which had just occurred near Penjwin. Three Iranian frontier guards had, it appears, entered Iraq, possibly in pursuit of a brigand, and had fired on Iraqi police. In the skirmish which followed, three guards had been killed and their bodies had been removed by their comrades to Iran, doubtless with a view to con cealing the whereabouts of the clash. A distorted version of what occurred reached the Shah, hence the violence of the Iranian note. 197. In spite of the high feelings aroused on both sides, the situation was ultimately met by arrangements whereby Iraqi troops were sent to Kurdistan to co-operate with Iranian troops across the border in restoring order. Although the Iranian forces were at first unhelpful, pleading that their commander was ill, the presence of the Iraqi troops did something to improve the situation. After two months some measure of co-operation with the Iranian forces was arranged, and from the middle to the end of October, when the Iraqi troops had to return to winter quarters at Sulaimani, concerted movements were carried out on the frontier. Italy. Italian Propaganda. 198. The intensive development of Italian propaganda throughout the Arab world was less noticeable in Iraq—still something of a back-water—than in other countries of the Near and Middle East which are doubtless more susceptible to European influences. At the same time Iraq was not altogether neglected as a field for pro-Italian propaganda. 199. In February the Italian Legation sent copies to all the Bagdad newspapers of a book about the Abyssinian war called The Greatest Colonial Conquest in History; but, as the only paper to give any space to the book described it as “a piece of propaganda of the usual sort,” Signor Gabbrielli cannot have felt adequately rewarded for his pains. On the other hand, the Italian Legation found in a local newspaper called the Saut-al-Shab (the Voice of the People) a pliant instrument for the dissemination of Fascist ideas. 200. This newspaper reported enthusiastically on the Duce’s triumphal progress through Libya in March and on his claim to be the Protector of Islam. Other papers, however, referred in hostile fashion to the Fascist leader’s37 £t antics,” which they compared to those of Wilhelm II before the war, and his utterances on this occasion were generally regarded in Iraq as so much ridiculous bombast. Indeed, the Mufti of Mosul was doubtless expressing the views of many when, in an open letter which he addressed to Signor Mussolini in April, he fc. ^ rebuked him for his presumption in assuming the role of defender of the Moslems, and reminded him of the ruthless methods whereby Italian rule had been established in North Africa. 201. It must be admitted, however, that towards the end of the year, when anti-British feeling ran high as a result of the Palestinian policy of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, several newspapers not normally friendly to Italy spoke of the possibility of Arab countries being obliged to turn elsewhere for the help and protection which they had looked for in vain from Great Britain. 202. In November some publicity was given in the press to false reports derived from Italian sources to the effect that Great Britain had designs on the Hadramut. At the request of His Majesty’s Embassy, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs arranged for an official denial of these rumours to be published. 203. During the summer a small party of Iraqi students (from the two American schools in Bagdad) visited Italy at the expense of the Italian Government. Iraqi Visitors to Italy. 204. The Minister of Defence, Abdul Latif Nuri, who visited Europe in the summer with an Iraqi military delegation, received a particularly warm welcome in Rome, where he was the guest of the Italian Government. The Order of the Crown of Italy (first class) was bestowed upon him; and the other members of the delegation received minor decorations. The chief of the Iraqi air force was also warmly welcomed when he visited Rome. Purchase of A erof lanes, &amp;c. 205. The preparations that Italy had made for the Abyssinian campaign put her in a more favourable position than other countries to meet demands for modern aircraft; and in June the Iraqi Government, egged on by Bekr Sidqi and tempted by offers of immediate delivery, instructed the chief of the Iraqi air force, who was on a visit to Europe, to come home by way of Italy and negotiate the purchase of aircraft with the Italian authorities. 206. Mohammad Ali Jawad, who was made much of in Rome, eventually placed an order for fifteen Breda fighters and seven Savoia bombers with the £ Italian Government. Jawad, who was accompanied by two Italian mechanics, flew back to Iraq in one of the bombers; but, unfortunately for himself, in a demonstration which he gave at Bagdad shortly after his arrival (in the presence of the Prime Minister and the Italian Minister) he crashed with the new machine, which was completely ruined. 207. This mishap had a demoralising effect on the Iraqis, as also had the murder of Ali Jawad at Mosul a few weeks later. When, therefore, Akram Mushtaq (now chief of the Iraqi air force) returned shortly after the assassination from Rome, where he had been sent on a visit of inspection, and reported that the newly-acquired aircraft made demands on Iraqi flying skill far beyond the standard yet attained, the Jamil Madfai Government determined to do their best to get out of a bad bargain. All they succeeded in achieving, however, was the replacement of the Savoia part of the order by the slightly less objectionable Breda planes. 208. In the circumstances His Majesty’s Government thought it necessary to acquiesce in the temporary employment by the Iraqi Government of a small number of Italian civilian mechanics whose assistance was necessary on technical grounds. The action taken by them to ensure that Italian air personnel should not secure a permanent footing in this country and the question of the extent to which the Iraqi Government may be considered to have infringed the provisions of the Treaty of Alliance, when placing the above order, is treated elsewhere in this report.38 209. In September eight tanks of Italian origin were delivered in Iraq and more are expected. As there were no trained tank crews in readiness to take them over, these constitute a further proof of the recklessness with which the late Chief of the General Staff and his advisers responded to Italian blandishments, regardless of the needs of their country or the state of its Exchequer. Koweit and Gulf States. General Relations with Koweit. 210. There was no improvement in relations between Iraq and Koweit during 1937, and the prospects of a comprehensive settlement between the two countries seemed as far off at the end of the year as at the beginning. On the Iraqi side exasperation continued to be felt at the continuance of smuggling, which, as stated in last year’s report, is the root cause of all the troubles; while, on the Koweiti side, frequent incursions into the sheikh’s territory by Iraqi police gave rise to justifiable complaint on the part of his Highness. Moreover, the deadlock over smuggling hampered the efforts of His Majesty’s Government to obtain the consent of the Iraqi Government to the proposals made in the summer of 1936 whereby the question of recognising the Sheikh of Koweit’s title to his date gardens would be dealt with under the procedure laid down by the Iraqi Land Settlement Law. Smuggling. 211. In August the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs wrote to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires informing him that the Iraqi customs police had arrested two Bedouins on camels laden with smuggled goods from Koweit, which included two rifles and much ammunition. Abbas Mahdi reminded Mr. Scott that the sheikh had told Dr. Naji in November 1936 that he had forbidden Koweitis to smuggle arms into Iraq, and requested that steps might be taken to put an end to smuggling in general and arms smuggling in particular. Mr. Scott wrote requesting the Officiating Political Resident in the Gulf to have the alleged facts investigated, but, owing to Iraqi uncertainty as to the names and nationality of the two Bedouins concerned, no further light had been cast on the matter by the end of the year. Frontier Incidents. (i) On Land. 212. In January the Iraqi Government agreed, at the request of His Majesty’s Government to allow the Political Agent at Koweit to be associated with a British official in the Iraqi service in the investigation of eight cases of alleged intrusion into Koweit which occurred during 1936. (One of the eight cases concerned alleged violation of Koweiti waters.) 213. Major Sargon, a police officer 4 in the Iraqi service, was chosen to conduct the enquiries which were carried out, in conjunction with Captain de Gaury and the Iraqi Commandant of Police at Mosul, at or near the places where the incidents have occurred. The enquiries took place in January and February. In the opinion of the Political Agent the alleged incursions were proved in five out of the eight cases examined. Nevertheless, in a letter regarding the enquiry which the Minister for foreign Affairs addressed to His Majesty’s Ambassador in June, Dr. Naji said that no incursions into Koweiti territory or waters had been proved to have taken place, and laid much stress on the light cast by the investigations on the smuggling activities of Koweit. 214. In April, at the request of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, His Majesty s Ambassador informed the Iraqi Government of an incursion of Iraqi police which occurred on the 6th March, and asked that the incident might lie investigated in accordance with the Sargon-de-Gaury precedent. The reply, which was not received until September, denied that any police had crossed the frontier and ignored the suggestion for an enquiry. 215. In October the Sheikh of Koweit reported a raid by armed Iraqi police on a caravan 15 miles inside the frontier. This raid resulted in several casualties and the loss of sixty camels and, as the Political Agent visited the scene of the39 ^ A onslaught, of which he saw many traces, a few days after it occurred, there could be no doubt as to the facts, though it turned out that the victims were not Koweities at all, but Iraqi tribesmen carrying goods obtained in Koweit. Under instructions from His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, His Majesty’s Ambassador in November lodged a strong protest with the Iraqi Government against the incursion demanding the early investigation of the incident, the punishment of the offenders and assurances against the recurrence of such raids. The Iraqi Government were not in this instance asked to associate the Political Agent at Koweit with their investigations. By the end of the year His Majesty’s Ambassador had still not heard what steps the Iraqis were taking to comply with the demand of His Majesty’s Government. (ii) A t Sea. 216. In March His Majesty’s Ambassador, at the request of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, drew the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to two incidents which were reported by the Sheikh of Koweit to have occurred in Koweiti waters earlier in the year, the one involving the arrest and ill-treatment by Iraqi police of some woodcutters who were in a jolly-boat on their way to collect brushwood; the other affecting a party of prawn-catchers who were driven away from one of their accustomed fishing resorts and threatened with arrest if they returned. Sir Archibald Clark Kerr suggested that these incidents should be referred to a committee similar to that which had investigated some allegations in regard to police raids earlier in the year (see paragraph 212 of this report). No reply was, however, received for two months, and when it came, it was to the effect that the first incident had taken place within Iraqi waters, and that the woodcutters were in reality smugglers, while the second incident had not taken place at all. 217. In June, again at the request of the Political Resident, His Majesty’s Ambassador brought a further statement by Koweiti fishermen, alleging inter ference by Iraqi police with their fishing rights, to the notice of the Iraqi Government. After three months the Ministry for Foreign Affairs replied denying in plausible fashion that the fishermen in question had had any just cause for complaint. Service of Documents. 218. As has been mentioned above, no progress has been made in settling the sheikh’s title to his estates in Iraq, and in August the Iraqi Government, reverting to an attitude which they had already adopted on more than one occasion, informed His Majesty’s Embassy that they could no longer accept the situation whereby the sheikh was able, through his accredited agents, to have ^ recourse to the courts of Iraq, whereas Iraqi plaintiffs were debarred from bringing suits against him in the courts because of the refusal by His Majesty’s Government to act as a channel for the service of documents on the sheikh. While the position created by this decision was still under consideration by His Majesty’s Government, the Iraqi Government (in November) forcibly served summonses on the sheikh’s attorney in Basra, citing his Highness as a defendant in suits concerning the title of some of his properties. 219. On instructions from His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Ambassador, in December, informed the Iraqi Government of the concern felt by His Majesty’s Government at the action taken. He warned them that His Majesty’s Government still held the Iraqi Government ultimately responsible for the fulfilment of the pledge safeguarding the sheikh’s title, and urged that the threatened legal proceedings should be suspended until the proposals made for the settlement of this question made in the summer of 1931) had received attention. Nationality Question. 220. Pursuing a subject which they had originally raised in May 1934, but which had been allowed to drop, the Iraqi Government in April approached His Majesty’s Embassy with a request for information about the date of origin of Bahreini and Koweiti nationality. On being asked why they required this information, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs replied (in December) that it was40 needed in connexion with the application of the Iraqi Nationality Law and in order to put an end to unjustified claims to excemption from military service by persons claiming to be either Koweitis-or Bahreinis. 221. It thus became clear that, as had already been suspected, the point was being pressed as a result of the endeavours made by His Majesty’s Embassy f to establish the exclusive Bahreini nationality of several men who had been conscripted or threatened with conscription during the year. One of these men (a Bahreini-born Bahreini) was released as a result of the Embassy’s representa tions, but another was still serving at the end of the year, while several more were in danger of being called to the colours. 222. In November His Majesty’s Embassy learned unofficially that the Iraqi departmental experts were disposed to take the line that Bahrein, as well as Koweit, was not finally detached from the Ottoman Empire until the date of ratification of the Treaty of Lausanne, and that in consequence the inhabitants of both territories came within the scope of article 3 of the Nationality Law whereby former Ottoman subjects habitually resident in this country were declared to have acquired Iraqi nationality on the 6th August, 1924. The matter was fully reported to the Foreign Office, and instructions were requested as to what action should, in these circumstances, he taken by His Majesty's Embassy. 223. In December the Ministry for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty’s Embassy that the Iranian Minister, on instructions from Tehran, had called on him regarding a rumour that the Sheikh of Bahrein intended to visit Bagdad shortly to discuss some questions of common interest with the Iraqi Government. The Iranian Minister had stated that he was to inform the Iraqi Government that Iran regarded Bahrein as an integral part of her Empire, and would hold the participation of the Iraqi Government in any such discussions to be an act unbecoming in a friendly State. The Minister for Foreign Affairs had said that there was no truth in the report, and that in any case the dispute between the Iranian Government and His Majesty’s Government about Bahrein was not one in which the Iraqi Government was in any way concerned. Sir Archibald Clark Kerr pointed out that, inasmuch as the Iraqi Government were conscripting Bahreinis on the ground that they were ex-Ottoman subjects, the reply might perhaps have gone a little further. Visa Fees. 224. In 1932 it was laid down by the Iraqi Department of Passports, Residence and Nationality, that visas for Iraq should be granted to nationals of the Arab States in the Gulf for a fee of 1 rupee only. It was also recommended that reciprocal treatment should be accorded to Iraqis desirous of obtaining visas for these States. This recommendation, owing to some oversight, was not put into effect, but as a result of representations made by His Majesty’s Embassy, the Treasury, in the course of 1937, sanctioned the reduction from 10 gold francs to 1 rupee of the fee for visas granted to Iraqi nationals travelling to any of the States in question. Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabian Representatives. 225. Early in the year both Hikmat Sulaiman and Dr. Naji complained to His Majesty’s Ambassador about the unseemly conduct of the Saudi Arabian Charge d'Affaires Sheikh-bin-Moammar, against whom similar complaints had been made by former Cabinets, was accused of keeping in touch with the political opponents of the Government and of encouraging fanatical Sunni elements in their hatred of the Shiahs. It was also said that the Saudi Legation was frequented by Iraqi tribal leaders, among whom Sheikh Ibrahim carried on a subtle propaganda designed to enhance the reputation of Ibn Saud and to bring King Ghazi and his Government into contempt and disrepute. 226. The Iraqi Government took the opportunity of the Amir Saud’s visit to Bagdad in April to make lengthy complaints, both to His Royal Highness and to Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, who accompanied him, about Sheikh Ibrahim’s conduct. The Amir, who seemed shocked by these revelations, undertook to report the matter to King Abdul Aziz, and to suggest that the Charge d’Affaires should41 * A be removed. The Amir’s advice was taken, and in the course of the summer Sheikh Ibrahim was replaced by Sheikh Muhammad ’Id-al-Rawwaf, a discreet and dignified person, whose appointment appears to have given satisfaction to the Iraqi Government. Treaty of A rab Brotherhood. 227. In June King Abdul Aziz informed the Iraqi Government of his approval of the Yemeni instrument of accession to the 1936 treaty (see para graph 247 of this report). Since the Yemeni instrument is in effect a separate treaty (which will henceforth govern the relations between the Yemen on the one hand, and both Iraq and Saudi Arabia on the other), the question arises, what effect, if any, it will have on relations between Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Generally, the position would seem to be that, as between the last-named two countries, the 1936 treaty will operate unchanged. Visit of the Amir Sand. 228. His Royal Highness the Amir Saud, who was accompanied by Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, paid an official visit to Iraq at the end of March. The Amir arrived at Bagdad on the 28th March and remained in the capital as King Ghazi’s guest until the evening of 3rd April. The programme of official ceremonies followed closely that which had been arranged for the Crown Prince of Sweden in 1934, and included banquets given by the King, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. His Royal Highness did Sir Archibald and Lady Clark Kerr the honour of dining at His Majesty’s Embassy. A military review was organised for the Amir’s entertainment, in which over 5,000 Iraqi troops of all arms and about thirty aeroplanes took part. His Royal Highness is under stood to have been pleased by the arrangements made for him and gratified by the warmth of the popular welcome given to him when he appeared in public. On leaving Basra on his return journey, the Amir telegraphed to King Ghazi a message of thanks, in which he referred to the pleasure which it had given him to observe the progress of Iraq and the “ truly Arab spirit ” which animated the Iraqi people. Intervention in Palestine. 229. After the concerted appeal by Iraq and Saudi Arabia made in January to the Arabs of Palestine to drop their boycott of the Royal Commission, no further joint action was taken by the Arab Kings. After the publication of the Royal Commission’s report and the adoption by His Majesty’s Government of the policy of partition, King Abdul Aziz sounded the Iraqi Government as to the line of action which they were likely to take, but these overtures did not lead to any further concerted action, and from conversations which took place between members of the Embassy staff and Yusuf Yasin, when he was in Bagdad in October, it would seem unlikely that King Abdul Aziz would endeavour to concert a move with the Iraqi Government without at first consulting His Majesty’s Government. King Abdul Aziz is known to be intensely suspicious of Iraq’s competition for the leadership of the Arab world and, from what Sheikh Yusuf Yasin said, he would appear also to be somewhat jealous of the limelight which Iraq enjoyed in September at Geneva, a stage on which he himself can play no part. Syria. Treaty Relations. 230. A “ Bon Voisinage ” Agreement was signed at Damascus on the 24th April, in the course of a visit to Syria by the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs. The agreement, which was to remain in force until three months after denunciation by one of the parties, was chiefly concerned with the activities of the nomadic tribes in the frontier districts, and made provision for the submission to arbitration of those tribal disputes which could not be settled by the frontier authorities. Both Governments agreed not to encourage or entice nationals of one country to settle in the other. A law, authorising the King of Iraq to ratify the treaty, was published in the Official Gazette in July.42 Proposed Mediation by Iraq between Syria and Turkey. 231. The Minister for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty s Ambassador in April that he had received a report from the Iraqi Minister in Angora, according to which the Turkish Government were much disturbed by the constant raids, from Syria into Turkish territory, of bands of Turkish and Armenian ^ brigands who, they believed, were encouraged in their predatory activities by the French authorities in Syria. The Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs had enquired, said Dr. Naji-al-Asil, whether the Iraqi Government could help by giving a friendly warning to the Syrian Government of the dangerous consequences to which these incursions might give rise. His Majesty’s Ambassador told Dr. Naji that he could not see what the French would have to gain by encouraging such activities and doubted very much whether they had done so. It would not appear that any representations of the kind suggested by Dr. Aras were actually made by Iraq to the Syrian authorities. Turkey. Sanjak of Alexandretta. 232. The Minister for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty’s Ambassador on his return from the visit to Damascus and Angora, which he paid in the spring, that he had found the leading members of the Syrian Government disposed to believe that Turkish policy aimed at the eventual annexation of Alexandretta and Aleppo. He had done his best to allay these fears and had agreed, in his capacity as an Arab desirous of promoting good relations between Turkey and Syria, to do what he could to persuade the Turkish Government to pay more attention to the Arab point of view when considering the future of the sanjak. Dr. Naji confessed, however, that his well-meaning efforts had received no encouragement from the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs. Although it was regretted that such large concessions had had to be made to the Turkish point of view, the news of the settlement of the Franco-Turkish dispute over the sanjak in May was on the whole received with relief in Iraq. Exchange of Visits. 233. Owing to the Turkish origin and sympathies of Hikmat Sulaiman, it was only to be expected that the friendliest relations between Iraq and Turkey would prevail while he was in power. Such expectations were fully realised. 234. In April Dr. Naji-al-Asil, Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Hikmat Cabinet, paid an official visit, lasting three days, to Angora, where he was feted in the manner usual on such occasions and expressed himself delighted with the warmth of his reception. In the communique issued at the conclusion of the visit, it was stated inter alia that Turkey, as well as Iraq, desired to establish good relations with all the Arab States. 235. On 22nd June Dr. Aras, who was the first prominent Turkish statesman to enter Iraq since it began its independent existence, arrived in Bagdad on a visit of courtesy. His Excellency, who was accompanied by the Minister of Economics (now Prime Minister) and a number of secretaries and experts, stayed five days in the Iraqi capital. A busy programme was arranged for the visit, which included an audience and dinner-party at the Royal Palace and receptions by the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Turkish Minister in Bagdad. There could be no doubt about the gratification felt by the Hikmat Cabinet at this visit, which also, to judge by the acclamations with which Dr. Taufiq Aras was everywhere greeted, was popular with the general public, who must none the less have been vividly reminded by the lavish display of Turkish flags of the days of Ottoman rule. Dr. Aras and three secretaries were flown from Bagdad to Tehran on the 25th June in a Royal Air Force “ Valentia” aeroplane. M. Jalal Bayar flew to Basra on the same day in the Port Director’s aeroplane, returning that evening to Bagdad where he remained until the 29th June, when he left for Turkey. It is understood that during his time in Iraq M. Bayar raised the question of direct supply to Turkey of oil from the M!osul oil-fields and also of direct railway communication with Turkey (see paragraph 239). An official communique issued by the Iraqi43 Government stated that the conversations held during Dr. Aras’s visit showed that the policy of the two countries was identical. In conversation with His Majesty’s Ambassador, Dr. Aras said that he had made a point of impressing upon King Ghazi and his Ministers the great importance of maintaining the closest and most friendly relations with Great Britain and had warned them against the dangers of German and Italian propaganda. Treaty Relations. 236. On the 28th April, at Angora, the Iraqi and Turkish Ministers for Foreign Affairs exchanged notes extending, as between Turkey and Iraq only, and with slight modifications, the provisions of Chapter 2 of the treaty of the 5th June, 1926, between the United Kingdom, Iraq and Turkey (see paragraph 231 of the report for 1936). The notes were subsequently ratified both by the Turkish and by the Iraqi Parliaments. Turkey and the Four-Power Pact. 237. The fact that the signature on the 8th July of the Four-Power Pact (Treaty of Sa’adabad) proved possible was doubtless largely due to the influence of the Turkish Government and particularly of Dr. Aras, who, anxious that the pact should become a fait accompli during 1937, and realising that the Iraqi Government were reluctant to sign until a satisfactory settlement of the Irano- Iraqi frontier question was reached, did his best to persuade the Iranian Government to take up a more conciliatory attitude. A protocol to the Four- Power Pact, also dated the 8th July, provided for a council to be formed consisting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the countries concerned, who, it was agreed, would meet at least once a year at Geneva or elsewhere. At a meeting held at Tehran it was, moreover, decided that the signatories of the pact would support the candidature of Iran to the seat on the Council to be vacated by Turkey in the autumn; and would also support the re-election of Turkey as a semi-permanent member. When the time came, however, it was only Iran who secured a seat. Heirs of Sultan Abdul Hamid. 238. Judgment was entered in November in favour of the claimants in the test case brought in the Land Court of Jaffa against the Palestine Government by the heirs of Sultan Abdul Hamid. This judgment, if upheld on appeal, may have considerable importance, and will probably encourage the heirs to make claim to other lands, notably in Iraq. Railway System. 239. A delegation of Turkish experts visited Bagdad in the spring to study the question of linking up the Turkish with the Iraqi railway system. The delegation made it clear that their Government desired to proceed with the work immediately and, if possible, to secure its completion within four years. The Iraqi Government, however, while professing agreement as to the economic and other advantages which would accrue from the linking up of the two systems, refrained from making any practical proposals. Their attitude was probably due to the fact that the building of the line from Mosul to Nisibin is likely to absorb their resources for the present, while some misgivings may also be felt on account of the strategic advantages which the new line would give to the Turks. These difficulties might well hold matters up for years, were it not for the apparent determination of the Turkish Government to proceed with the scheme energetically. 240. On the 16th November the Turkish Prime Minister, in the presence of Kemal Ataturk, officially inaugurated at Diarbekir the new line of which one branch is to end at the Iranian, and the other at the Iraqi, frontier; and if, as seems probable, the Turkish Government offer to facilitate the financing of the comparatively short sector of the new line which would be required to link the Turkish and Iraqi railway systems, it may be that the hesitations of the Iraqi Government will be overcome.44 United States of A merica. Iraqi Consular Representation. 241. From a chance allusion in a note received from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in August, His Majesty’s Embassy learned that an Iraqi vice-consul had * been appointed to New York. Subsequent research revealed that the post was held by Sheikh Mustafa-al-Ibrahim, who was appointed honorary vice-consul in February 1937, and duly received an exequatur from the United States Govern ment. Sheikh Mustafa’s consular district is confined to New York City, and he is authorised to grant visas on personal application. In November His Majesty’s consul-general handed over to Sheikh Mustafa, in so far as the City of New York was concerned, the consular functions which he had hitherto exercised on behalf of the Iraqi Government. The consul-general retained responsibility for Iraqi interests and nationals in that part of his district which lies outside the city. Sheikh Mustafa is the first Iraqi consular representative in the United States. Proposed Abolition of Visa Fees. 242. In August the Ministry for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty’s Embassy that the Iraqi Government desired to conclude with the United States Government an agreement for the abolition of visa fees (except in respect of immigrants), and asked that, in view of the fact that His Majesty’s consular officers in the United States act on behalf of Iraqi subjects, the observations of His Majesty’s Government might be obtained regarding this proposal. The Embassy were instructed to state that His Majesty’s Government had no observations to offer upon the conclusion of such an agreement. They were to explain, however, that it would not be possible for His Majesty’s consular officers to waive their fees in respect of visas granted by them on behalf of the Iraqi Government to United States citizens. No more had been heard of the proposal at the end of the year. Vatican. 243. The question of appointing a Papal representative remained in abeyance throughout the year; and Vatican interests were looked after by Father Rice, the Superior of the Jesuit College, in the capacity of Acting Apostolic delegate, although his recognition as such was neither asked for nor accorded. There is some reason to suppose that the Holy See sounded the Iraqi Government in the spring with a view to the appointment of Father Rice to the position of Apostolic delegate. Since nothing more was heard of the matter, it may be presumed that the suggestion did not commend itself to the new Iraqi Government, who perhaps shared the objections raised by Nuri-al-Said to the presence of a foreign Papal representative in this country (see paragraph 237 of last year’s report). 244. In October the Chaldean Patriarch, who was stated in the press to have been specially summoned by the Pope, left Bagdad for Rome. He returned shortly before Christmas. Yemen. Yemeni Cadets in Iraq. 245. In the course of the summer five Yemeni cadets at the Iraqi Military School, who are understood to have passed the examination creditably, graduated as officers. At the graduation ceremony, held in July, the Chief of the General Staff expressed the hope that their success would help towards the adoption of a uniform system of military education in Iraq and the Yemen. The young officers took copies of all Iraqi military textbooks (mostly Arabic translations of the standard British manuals) back to the Yemen, where they expect to be employed as instructors in the military school at Sanaa. Five other Yemeni students completed a course of wireless telegraphy. It was announced in the press in August that the Imam had decided to send a second party of cadets to the military college.Treaty Relations. 246. In reply to King Ghazi’s proposal to send a delegation to the Yemen (see paragraph 243 of the report for 1936), with a view to securing the adherence of that country to the Treaty of Arab Brotherhood and Alliance between Iraq and Saudi Arabia, Imam Yahya replied in February that, while approving the general purpose of the treaty, he felt difficulty about adhering to it as it stood owing to the manner in which its provisions were conditioned by the Covenant of the League of Nations and other international instruments. He explained that, in his view, it was unnecessary for the foreign policy of his country to have a wider aim than peace and friendship with the rest of the Arab world, and he therefore proposed a new treaty, from which all reference to Iraq’s other treaties and to the League of Nations should be excluded. 247. Though somewhat puzzled to know what action they should take as a result of this communication, the Iraqi Government decided to send a delegation, consisting of Jamil-al-Madfai, Said Thabit and Mahdi Kubbah, which arrived at Hodeida in April. The mission were told to try to induce the Imam to accept the Iraqi-Saudi Treaty of 1936 without reservations; and Ibn Saud’s good offices were also enlisted with this end in view. The Imam, however, proved obdurate, and the instrument of accession, which he signed on 17th April, although following the general lines of the original treaty, differed from it in several respects, everything being omitted which, in the eyes of the Imam, would be likely to involve his country in international complications. He seems to have over looked, however, the consequences which might conceivably result from the omission of the provisions included in article 4 (c) of the original treaty, whereby certain acts are defined as not constituting aggression. In view of this omission, if Great Britain were to take action against Iraq in enforcement of article 16 of the Covenant, or pursuant to a decision emanating from the League Council, such action might be held by the Imam to constitute aggression, and he might, under article 4 of the instrument of accession, concert with the Iraqi Government in resisting it. Other hypothetical complications can be imagined, but both the treaty itself and the Yemeni act of accession offer so many loopholes of escape from all possible embarrassments that, in practice, it is doubtful whether the omission of proper safeguards is likely to give rise to any considerable difficulties either to Iraq or to His Majesty’s Government. 248. On the whole, after carefully considering the terms of the new instrument, His Majesty’s Government decided that there was no ground for taking exception to it; and, indeed, the accession of the Yemen is probably little more than a gesture intended to give concrete expression to the feelings of racial fellowship, sympathy and common interest which bind that country to the two original signatory States. 249. The Iraqi delegation returned to Bagdad in May, having—so it was announced—successfully accomplished their mission; and in July a law authorising King Ghazi to ratify the instrument of accession was published in the Iraqi Official Gazette.48 IV.— Air and Military Matters. Royal Air Force. Command. 251. On the 26th February Air Vice-Marshal C. L. Courtney took the place ^ of Air Vice-Marshal W. G. S. Mitchell as Air Officer Commanding, British Forces in Iraq. Strength. 252. The number of fighting units in the Iraq Command remained unchanged. The distribution of the units at their permanent stations at the end of the period under review was as follows :— Dhibban— No. 70 (B.T.) Squadron. Nos. 30 and 55 (B) Squadrons. No. 1 Armoured Car Company (less one section). Shaibah— No. 84 (B) Squadron. One section of No. 1 Armoured Car Company. Basra— No. 203 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron. Re-equifment. 253. During the year the Air Ministry decided to re-equip No. 30 (B) Squadron with Blenheims. These aircraft began to arrive in November. No. 55 (B) Squadron was re-equipped with Vincents in March. Dhibban. 254. The construction of the new cantonment at Dhibban is almost complete and the transfer of units effected by the end of 1937 when Hinaidi cantonment was in course of being handed over to the Iraqi Government. Landing Grounds in Iraq. 255. During the year landing grounds in Iraq were handed over to the Iraqi Government in accordance with the 1932 treaty. Although the Iraqi Government have undertaken to maintain all these landing grounds, it is doubtful whether they will, in practice, keep up those which are not in regular use. Inter-Command Flights. 256. In January 1937 the Singapore Reinforcement Scheme was practised. Nine aircraft of No. 70 (B.T.) Squadron, twelve of No. 84 (B) Squadron, and four aircraft of No. 203 (G.R.) Squadron flew to Singapore, and there Nos. 84 and 203 Squadrons took part in combined operations. 257. In October No. 55 (B) Squadron carried out an inter-command flight. Twelve aircraft left Dhibban on the 4th October and proceeded to Aden via the Hadramut coast. After remaining at Aden for five days, they left on the 15th October and flew to Fgypt via Port Sudan and Khartum. The squadron returned to this command on the 26th October. 258. At the request of the Government of India a flight of four aircraft of No. 70 (B.T.) Squadron flew to Risalpur arriving on the 31st May. During the period May to September this flight took part in the Waziristan operations. They were employed in ferrying supplies to isolated garrisons and evacuating casualties. The flight returned to Iraq at the beginning of September 1937. Liaison Flights to Syria. 259. On the 5th April Colonel Roques, Commanding the French Air Forces in Syria and the Lebanon, visited Hinaidi. At his suggestion, flights of Nos. 55, 84 and 30 Squadrons visited Syria during the summer. These flights flew to49 Rayak, where they were very hospitably entertained by the French air force. They stayed five days, in the course of which they visited a number of French landing grounds in Syria. A party of French air force officers, headed by Colonel Roques, again visited Iraq during November at the invitation of the Air Officer Commanding and inspected the stations at Ohibban, Basra and r ^ Shaibah. Summer Training Camp. 260. The annual summer training camp opened at Ser Amadia on the 6th June, and between that date and the 13th September eighty-seven officers and 524 airmen visited the camp. Parties were flown to Simel by aircraft of Nos. 70 and 55 Squadrons and thence carried by road transport to the camp. The usual friendly relations with the local inhabitants were maintained. Air Liaison Officers. 261. Air liaison officers were maintained at Bagdad, Mosul, Sulaimani and Basra. An air liaison officer, who took up his appointment at Bahrein in May, was unfortunately killed in a flying accident in October. He is to be replaced. Surveys. 262. During the year survey work has been carried out in an area about 80 miles wide astride the trans-desert track for a distance of 120 miles west of Ramadi, and also in A1 Wadyan as far south as the border of Saudi Arabia. Armoured Cars. 263. During the past year the usual number of training exercises have taken place. Sections have visited most parts of the country and on two occasions composite sections have proceeded to Palestine. Visits. 264. (i) Under-Secretary of State for Air .—On the 10th September, Lieutenant-Colonel A. J. Muirhead, M.C., M.P., Under-Secretary of State for Air, arrived in this country in a Valentia of No. 216 (B.T.) Squadron. During his stay he inspected the stations at Dhibban, Shaibah and Basra and left for Palestine in a Valentia of No. 70 (B.T.) Squadron on the 15th September. Colonel Muirhead was received by King Ghazi and a dinner was given in his honour by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. 265. (ii) The General Officer Commanding British Troops in Egypt .— Lieutenant-General Sir George Weir, the General Officer Commanding British Troops in Egypt, with the Brigadier, General Staff, and two infantry officers visited the Iraq Command during May. Discussions took place on the subject of the reinforcement of Iraq by one or two battalions from Egypt in the event of emergency. Imperial A irways Services. 266. The civil air route through Iraq and the Persian Gulf to India has been in full operation for some years. Imperial Airways have now started a number of flying-boat services, for which facilities have been organised on Lake Habbaniyah. Moorings for the flying-boats were laid by the Royal Air Force. 267. Civil wireless stations are maintained by the Iraqi Government at Rutbah, Bagdad and Basra; at the latter place an Adcock direction-finding station of the latest pattern was installed at the beginning of the year. 8o far the Iraqi Government have not provided wireless facilities at Lake Habbaniyah but Imperial Airways have a standard wireless launch on the lake, and flying- boats are able to ‘ ‘ home ” on this. 268. Progress with the lighting of the air route is slow. A survey of the pumping station at H. 3 was made during the year to decide the best position for a beacon; and a beacon is being erected at L.G. 5.. 1 l»J#p ’ ^ 50 Iraq Levies. Organisation and Establishment. 269. The present location of the Iraq levies is : — Nos. 1, 2 and 3 (Assyrian) Companies at Hinaidi. No. 4 (Assyrian) Company at Dhibban. No. 5 (Arab) Company at Dhibban. No. 6 (Arab) Company at Shaibah. No. 7 (Arab) Company at Makinah. No. 8 (Kurdish) Company at Dhibban. During the period of the summer training camp No. 2 (Assyrian) Company was located at Ser Amadia for guard duties. When the summer training camp closed down this company returned to Hinaidi and No. 4 (Assyrian) ( ompany moved to Dhibban. By the end of the year Nos. 1, 2 and 3 (Assyrian) Companies had been transferred to Dhibban. Training. 270. Normal training has been carried out throughout the year. All Assyrian companies have been given mortar training, and necessary defence crews are now partially trained. Teams from each company have been trained in the use of A.A. light automatics. Iraqi Army. General. 271. For the first seven months of the year, military policy was in the hands of Bekr Sidqi, who had been appointed Chief of the General Staff after the cou'p d Etat of October 1936. From the beginning he pressed the inspector-general to give him all possible help in obtaining supplies of new weapons and equipment for the army. His requirements were sometimes extravagant, and he often overlooked the need for having personnel trained to use modern weapons before large sums were spent on making new purchases. The military mission did their utmost to temper his extravagance and were to some extent successful. They also made every effort to find the best means of obtaining the arms really needed for the re-equipment of the army. 272. The policy of army development, both during Bekr Sidqi’s time and under his successor, has been mistaken. The out-of-date idea of gaining more strength by increasing the number of infantry units still holds the field, and the advantages of mobility and fire-power over slow-moving masses of men are not appreciated. Even the best brains in the army prefer to create a third division, rather than to increase the efficiency, mobility and fire-power of the two divisions which already exist. In the two existing divisions, leaders, both officers and non commissioned officers, are already sadly lacking and, if those who are available are distributed over three divisions, the fighting value of the army as a whole will be lamentably reduced. Ancillary services of transport and supply main tained are neglected and the mission have constantly to contest the idea that the value and strength of the army lies in the nominal number of its fighting units. 273. During Bekr Sidqi’s regime the relations of the officers of the military mission with the Iraqi officers of the General Staff were often difficult, and they worked in an unhappy atmosphere of suspicion and distrust. After his death there was a substantial improvement and, under the friendly influence of Jamil- al-Madfai, his successor, Husain Fawzi, showed an agreeable willingness to co-operate with the mission. National Service. 274. It has been found in practice that the numbers of men of military age who purchase their exemption or discharge from compulsory service is on the increase. For this reason the price of exemption and discharge will probably be raised. The work of the recruiting officers has been unsatisfactory, and plans are being made to replace many of them by better men.51 Strength. 275. (a) cers .—There is a serious shortage of officers. The present strength is 384 below establishment. The shortage is mainly in the infantry, where the number of officers is 45 per cent, below establishment. Though 200 cadets passed out of the Royal Iraqi Military College in December, they will be of little use for another six months, as the period of training at the Royal Military College is now r only one year. 276. {b) Other Ranks .—The army is 12 per cent, below establishment in other ranks. Organisation. 277. One new infantry battalion was raised during 1937 to complete the 6th Infantry Brigade, which lost one infantry battalion when the Guard Battalion was formed. One Light Tank Company is being formed. At present it is only a cadre. Operations. 278. Operations were undertaken in May to subdue recalcitrant tribes near Rumaitha on the Middle Euphrates. Most of the work was done by the Iraqi air force, but some battalions of infantry and armed police co-operated. Training. 279. A certain amount of useful training was carried out from a mountain war camp by the 2nd Division in the early summer. Training in the Bagdad area was interrupted, first by the operations in the Middle Euphrates area in June, and then by the August assassinations. In October, however, the artillery of the 1st Division went to a practice camp at Iskanderiyah on the Euphrates near Hillah, and at the end of the month were joined by one infantry brigade and the mobile troops of the division, which included a combined armoured car and motor machine-gun unit. 280. Some rather elementary and unrealistic training was carried out in the desert. The infantry, as is only natural now that the bulk of it is conscripted, is backward and of indifferent quality. In other units, notably the artillery, efficiency is far higher, but tactical conceptions are old-fashioned and often wrong. 281. The efficiency of the younger officers of the army is fairly satisfactory and is improving', that of the senior officers, especially of battalion commanders, is low and shows no progress. A rmament and Equipment. 282. The inability of the War Office to supply much of the material needed for the army has caused the mission considerable difficulty. 283 The Iraq Government’s experiences of buying military equipment outside the United Kingdom have not, however, been happy. The tanks bought during the year from Italy were delivered in an almost unserviceable condition and the aeroplanes ordered in the same country proved to be entirely unsmted for use in the Iraqi air force. The first Savoia was crashed by the Officer Commanding the Air Force very soon after its arrival, and the Iraqi pilots are practically terrified of flying the high-speed Breda fighters, of which fifteen have been paid for. 284. Stocks of artillery ammunition are inadequate. The total supply would be exhausted by a war of ten days’ duration. Reserves of small-arms ammunition are also insufficient, but it is hoped shortly to increase the daily output of the factory by about one-third. Five thousand rounds were ordered from India, but this is not enough, and some of the money spent on guns should have been devoted to buying more shells.Ordnance. 285. The maintenance of mechanical transport is still bad. Except for some 200 or 300 new vehicles, the mechanical transport of the Iraqi army would be useless after a month of active service. A proper supply service does not exist. Administrative Services. 286. The handing over of Hinaidi by the Royal Air Force to the Iraqi Government will provide the Iraqi army with some better accommodation, but many units are still housed in very unsatisfactory quarters. Royal Iraqi Air Force. General. 287. The Iraqi air force began the year with promise. Its training was good, discipline was fair and a squadron at Mosul, although detached from head quarters control, had maintained its efficiency. A plan of expansion had been made which, if carried out, would have further improved and strengthened the force. Unfortunately the murder on the 11th August of Muhammad Ali Jawad, who was in command of the force, interrupted the progress which had been maintained from the beginning of the year. After his death discipline deteriorated, training was interrupted and plans for expansion fell to the ground. Towards the end of the year his successor, Akram Mushtaq, had taken steps to repair much of the damage caused by Muhammad Ali Jawad’s death. Operations. 288. From the 9th May to the 7th July most of the available aircraft were employed in joint operations in the Middle Euphrates area. One pilot and one air gunner were killed. Co-operation with the Army. 289. Very little training in army co-operation seems to have been carried out. During the autumn manoeuvres of the Bagdad division, aircraft were included in the scheme, but the part they played was very small and of no value from either an army or air force training point of view. One day’s co-operation with staff school students in making a reconnaissance of some distance was arranged} but the reports of the pilots were mediocre. Expansion. 290. Six new Gladiator aircraft were received for the equipment of two new fighter squadrons and the remaining five are expected early in 1938. Fifteen Breda fighters were bought in Italy, but none had been delivered in Iraq before the end of the year. New Station. 291. A large new hangar is being built at Kirkuk where the Gladiator and the Breda squadrons are to be stationed. This is certainly the best place for these squadrons, as it covers the air routes from Turkey and Iran, to Bagdad. Training. 292. Except for the flying training school, which continues to function in a most creditable manner, further ground nor air training has progressed. Courses. 293. The Ministry of Defence continued to send officers to the United Kingdom to take courses, but fewer vacancies were available than had been hoped for.-v \V THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT i v I Printed for the use of the Foreign Office.

THE past year has been one of some liveliness. It has been marked by the spilling of much blood on the Euphrates, by a crisis that shook the throne and by a military revolt that overthrew a Government and drove three of Iraq’s leading statesmen into hasty exile. 2. The beginning of the year saw the Yasin Cabinet still firmly in power. When in March they reached their first anniversary the Prime Minister was able to look back upon his past twelve months of office with some complacency. Many mistakes had indeed been made, but much had been achieved. Where he had failed, and where he continued to fail as the year went on, was in the3 E* fulfilment of his undertaking to bring peace and stability to the country and much needed reform to its administration. As in 1935 failure was due in the main to the presence in the Cabinet of Rashid Ali, a mischievous and, as it turned out, a disastrous influence from which Yasin had not the will to shake himself free. In the hands of Rashid Ali the administration of both the Interior , and of Justice was oblique, shortsighted and clumsy. Its effects were to be seen in the sustained ferment on the Euphrates which cost the Government much in human life and treasure and something in prestige. And again in the growing restlessness of Nuri, who was impatient of the blunders of Rashid Ah and o Yasin’s apparently heedless acquiescence in them and uneasy about whither they were leading the Government. 3. The affair of the Princess Azzah, which so damaged the position of King Ghazi that it seemed at one time likely to destroy the dynasty, had the happy, if passing, effect of recementing the alliance between Nuri and Yasin. At first a break seemed bound to come, for Nuri was plunging towards something in which Yasin saw disaster. But little by little Nuri was brought to wisdom, and, when they reached agreement upon how best to deal with the crisis, he and’Yasin pledged themselves to be loyal to each other. The way they took was well advised and led to the success it deserved in the patching up, as time went on, of the tattered prestige of the throne. 4. Soon after, the prolonged absence abroad of his fidgety colleague gave Yasin some breathing space. But in October Nuri returned with his old lessness hot upon him. Wishing to meet Parliament with renewed stiength, Yasin was bent upon reinforcing his Cabinet and eager for Nuri s help, but Nuri hung back, sulky and grumbling about Rashid Ali. Just when they seemed to be about to find common ground again they were swept, all three ot them, out of office and out of the country by a military coup d'Etat, which was as unexpected as it was swift and complete. 5. When the blow fell the partnership of Yasin and Nuri had the air of being unassailable from without, and free, as it was, of the swing of political influences which had stultified the work of so many Cabinets m the past, i seemed to promise the continuity of government which this country so bad y needed The tribes were cowed and quiescent. The already diminished power of the palace had been almost destroyed by the crisis of June The opposition seemed to be insignificant and inarticulate. So far as could be s 66 * 1 ^ othei weapon than intrigue lay at hand for those who wished to attack the Govern ment. This had been tried and had failed, for Yasin and Nun still held together. Yasin had even hinted at ten years of office, and Nuri was making more modest but no less confident plans for what was to be done a year hence. 1 o the country as a whole no Government could have appeared to be more securely m office. The Iraqis therefore were taken rudely by surprise. They were bowled over, but they were incontinently relieved, and in a day or two they were telling themse \es that with Yasin they had been living under a terror. 6 The circumstances in which the new Cabinet came to power, combined with the murder of Jafar-al-Askari, left a situation full of disturbing possi bilities. Its worst feature was the introduction of the army into politics. I hat force should have been used to oust the Government was no new thing, lasin himself had resorted to it in 1935 when he used the tribes to serve his purpose. Hikmat Sulaiman’s instrument was now the army, which hitherto had been appropriately aloof from all but its own affairs, and at first glance he seemed to have made it his master. At the army’s head was a general, who, to put things at their mildest, was known to be an ambitious and a pitiless man. 7. It was not therefore unnatural that it should have been assumed in this country and still more abroad that Iraq had fallen under a militaiy dictatorship. From the first the new Prime Minister denied this assumption He admitted that he had taken a risk m using the army to seive his ends, tut he claimed that his influence was strong enough to put it back mto lts P I i°P^ place. Time would show that his claim was justified. And it must be admitted that by the end of the year, things seemed to suggest that Hikmat bulaiman had been right. Bekr Sidqi had kept himself scrupulously clear of any inter ference in the councils of the Cabinet. For the appointments he made when be became Chief of the General Staff there were none but sound military reasons. [14956] B 2No one could point to a case of victimisation. So far as could be seen he was confining his attention to the army, and the army was accepting his leadership. 8. The change from Yasin to Hikmat Sulaiman did nothing to disturb the relations between Iraq and His Majesty’s Government in the United King dom, which had been put upon a pleasant footing of trust and co-operation. In his attitude towards the treaty of 1930 and the more recent commitments of his predecessors the new Prime Minister was more than correct, he was cordial. In his time Yasin had shown a fitting niceness in his observances of all agree ments by which Iraq was bound. But Hikmat Sulaiman seemed to wish to give things a new shape and to put into his relationship with ourselves an eagerness 'Which was as gratifying as it was novel. While Yasin had tended to ask for advice mainly when he was in serious trouble, his successor asked for advice all the time, not only of His Majesty’s Ambassador but of the British advisers to the Iraqi Government, who in the past had often been ignored. 9. It is possible that all this may be due in part to Hikmat Sulaiman’s awareness that his Government has made a bad start and to his anxiety to regain some lost ground, but there is nothing to show that the friendliness which he professes is not genuine enough. At the same time he is a realist. While he is keenly alive to the value to Iraq of her connexion with Great Britain he means to do his best to get out of it every advantage that it can bring to this country and by that we have nothing to lose. 10. At the end of the year he had been some two months in power and there were no signs of his having lost any ground. The people appeared to believe in him and in his will and his power to better their lot. Christians and Jews were reassured by his declared intention to protect minorities. He had been wise in his handling of the Euphrates tribes and in his clemency towards those who were suffering for the part they had played in the risings against his predecessor’s Government. Indeed, the future seemed to hold some hope if only Hikmat Sulaiman could achieve a long term of office. But in the mean while he had gathered no strength. His colleagues were weak and inexperienced. In effect he carried the Cabinet upon his back and that offered no promise of permanence. At the same time, although, as has been shown, it was not acute, the classic problem of the relation of the praetorian instrument to the civil machine remained unsolved. 11. Although last summer Hikmat Sulaiman was probably the harshest of His Majesty’s critics he has apparently shown forbearance enough to win King Ghazi’s confidence. He has been obliged somewhat to ease the fetters put upon the King by Yasin, with the result that some of the old influences are at work again. But he has kept a watchful eye upon His Majesty and the appoint ments he made to the palace were prudent. II. —Internal Affairs (Political). Cabinet and Parliament. 12. The beginning of the year found the Yasin Government still firmly in office. The Cabinet was as follows :— Prime Minister : Yasin-al-Hashimi. Foreign iVffairs: Nuri-ad-Said. Finance : Rauf Bahrani. Interior : Rashid Ali-al-Gilani. Justice: „ „ „ Defence : Jafar-al-Askari. Education : Sadiq Bassam. Economics and Communications : Amin Zaki. 13. The parliamentary session, which opened on the 2nd November, 1935, was twice prolonged, and Parliament was not prorogued until the 15th April, 1936. 14. During January both houses were chiefly occupied with the budget for the year 1935-36. As nine months of the year had already passed, these estimates were little more than stop-gap figures. The debates gave members5 and Ministers opportunities to review all branches of the administration of the country, but nothing was said that calls for record. One or two Deputies criticised the Prime Minister for doing nothing to amend the Anglo-Iraqi i reaty of Alliance of 1930, which, while out of office, he had so often and so hotly attacked; but Yasin Pasha knew how to defend himself and this slight opposition 'made no impression on the Government’s solid majority. 15. When it had dealt with the budget, Parliament gave its attention to a number of Government Bills. The more important measures which were passed are summarised below :— The Legal Interest Law. To limit to 7 per cent, the maximum rate of legal interest on loans. The Labour Law. . ^ To establish general control over labour conditions in Iraq. Drattea largely in accordance with principles recommended by the Inter national Labour Office. The Antiquities Law. 1 . . ... .

In late March the budget for 1936-37 was voted and, during the first two weeks of April, laws providing for the ratification of the Railway ment with the United Kingdom and the Treaty of Alliance with Saudi Arabia were passed. These measures are discussed elsewhere m this report. The Royal Family. 17. The prestige of the Royal family was severely shaken in the early summer by the runaway marriage, to a Greek hotel servant, of 1 rmcess Azzah, one of King Ghazi’s sisters. [14956] B 3• 6 18. In May, accompanied by her younger sister and a junior official fiom the palace, the princess set out for Vienna for medical treatment but the paity got no further than Athens. On the 28th May a telegram reached the palace from the secretary in charge of the party to the effect that Princess Azzah, after being received into the Greek Orthodox Church, had married a na tive o v o es of Italian nationality. The full story, slowly pieced together alter the first excitement had passed, showed that the affair had begun m the year befoie during her holiday in Ehodes where she had fallen in love with one Anastasios Charalambos. The news came as a great shock to King Ghazi and the Govern ment. The Master of Ceremonies was at once sent by air to Athens to see it anything could be done, and an effort was made to keep the story out ol the newspapers. This was .soon found to be impossible. Both the bride and the bridegroom had given liberal interviews to the Athenian press, and full details were soon published in newspapers throughout the world. The Master ot Ceremonies was unable to prevent the consummation of the marriage and a few days after his arrival in Athens Charalambos took his bride off to Rhodes by air, not without, it seems, the blessings of the Italian Legation. 19. The first reactions in Bagdad were violent. A daughter of one of the most noble Arab houses had been guilty of apostasy. She had married a man of humble birth and of despised race. Arab honour had been disgraced; the faith of the Prophet insulted. Great indignation was everywhere expressed, and there was an alarming revulsion of feeling against King Ghazi. Stories of his immoral private life—many of them, unfortunately, well founded—became common gossip and added to the general discredit brought upon the Hashimite family by the affair. In accordance with Arab tradition, Yasin and other Ministers insisted upon the necessity for killing the princess as the only means of restoring King Ghazi’s prestige and calming the outraged feelings of the people. 20. In the midst of the crisis Nuri returned from Europe. He took the gloomiest view of the situation. In his eyes King Ghazi had been so disgraced that he was no longer fit to reign. At one moment Nuri urged that the Government should depose him and set up a regency. The Prime Minister, though no less indignant than Nuri, was perturbed by this dangerous suggestion and turned to His Majesty’s Ambassador for help. Sir Archibald Clark Kerr advised that, above all, no action should be taken as long as heads were hot, that the bad influences about the court should be removed and that an effort should be made gradually to restore His Majesty’s lost prestige. With time the affair would blow over. Any such plan as Nuri’s would be likely to expose the country to the danger of internal strife. At the same time, he made it clear that, however much the murder of the princess might appeal to Iraqis, it would be condemned with horror and disgust by the entire non-Moslem world. This advice had its effect, and turned the minds of Ministers from murder to the possibility of dissolving the marriage. The Iraqi Minister in Rome appealed, without success, to the Italian Government. As no flaw could be found in either the civil or religious ceremonies, all thought of proceedings to invalidate the marriage was eventually abandoned, and outwardly, at any rate, the unfortunate affair had been forgotten by the end of the year. 21. It would, however, be a mistake to regard the monarchy in this country as having safely ridden out the storm aroused by the affair. Moslems have been wounded in their deepest feelings, and the King may yet have to pay dearly both for his sister’s and his own indiscretions. Disorders on the Euphrates. 22. From the beginning of the year until their fall at the end of October, the Yasin Cabinet had to deal with persistent trouble among the Euphrates tribes. This state of affairs was due in the main to the unrest caused by the intrigues of Yasin himself and Rashid AH during the early months of 1935. Contributory causes were the partisanship shown by the Government in dealing with tribal disputes, the enforcement of conscription and the inefficiency and misconduct of local officials. 23. The first outbreak occurred in February in the Shatrah district of the Muntafiq (Nasiriyah) Province. The tribes concerned were the Hatim, the Bani7 [14956] b 4 Rikab and the Khafajah. The trouble took the usual form acted promptly. Operations were successful, and by the 1st had submitted. The Government March the leaders 24. About the same time, some lawless elements in the neighbourhood of Suq-al-Shuyukh also took a hand in the game and fired on the local police post. The responsible leaders were immediately seized and sentenced to long terms ot imprisonment and rifle fines. The tribes concerned m these disorders are among the most unruly and warlike in Iraq, and the Government were elated that they had brought them so quickly to heel. For the rest of the year the Muntafiq tribes were kept fairly well under control. For this success the skill of the mutessani was largely responsible. But the fact that Ministers themselves did not intrigue with the Muntafiq sheikhs was also an important factor. 25 Bv contrast, in the Diwaniyah Province, where the mutessarifs were stupid and inexperienced and Bagdad intrigue was rife, the tribes were constantly in revolt. The first signs of dangerous restlessness appeared towards the end ot April when some skirmishing with the Dhuwalim section of the Bam Huchaim confederation in the Rumaitha district (between Samawa and Diwaniyah) led to the suspension of the train service between Bagdad and Basra. Early m May, m a two-day battle, a tribal force of about 1,200 men was defeated with heavy loss. The armv suffered some ninety casualties in this engagement, and two aeroplanes were shot down. During the following week many villages were destroyed and crops were burned. When tribal resistance had been broken, a number of men many of whom, it is to be feared, were innocent, were summarily executed, and many more sentenced to long terms of imprisonment under martial law. 26. These events had political results, the full extent of which was only made clear some months later. They aroused ill-feeling against the Government for ao’ain resorting to arms to suppress discontent, and the Opposition groups adduced this as evidence of the incompetence of the Government to deal with internal affairs. 27. Two deputations of Senators and Deputies, led by Jamil Madfai and Hikmat Sulaiman, visited King Ghazi to protest against the shedding of Arab blood and against the brutality with which, they alleged, the tribes were being treated by the army. Flis Majesty did not give these deputations much encourage ment, and declared, with apparent sincerity, his entire confidence in Yasin and his colleagues. Nevertheless, the Euphrates disturbances undoubtedly shook the Government’s position. 28. There was further trouble only a few weeks later, when Sheikh Shalan- al-Atiyah, of the Akhra Confederation, suddenly came out at Daghara, 10 miles north of Diwaniyah. The Government again acted with energy. The sheikh’s fort at Daghara was destroyed, and the tribal losses in dead and wounded were heavy, whife those of the army were light. Several of Shalan’s close relatives were killed or captured, but he himself made good his escape. For a while he remained a fugitive, but towards the end of June, having received an assurance that his life would’be spared and that he would not be imprisoned, he gave himself up and was sent to live at Ramadi. 29. As a further measure to deal with this insurrection, martial law was extended to cover practically the whole of the Diwaniyah liwa, and was not brought to an end until the 26th July. No report has been published of the number of persons tried or sentenced, but information from various sources indicates that about 125 persons were convicted, including twenty sentenced to death and about thirty-five to imprisonment for over ten years. 30. Towards the end of August disorders again broke out, this time at Khidr, near Samawa, where the Safwan tribe attacked the local police. The tribesmen were dispersed but not subdued, and in October the police were still engaged in stamping out the last embers of the revolt when Yasin’s Government fell. The tribe then speedily submitted. 31. One of the first acts of Hikmat Sulaiman’s Government was to release all those who had been imprisoned by the military courts or removed from their homes by administrative order, and after this the Diwaniyah Province remained quiet until the end of the year.mmm wtmm. mr- 8 Repercussions of Events in Palestine. 32. The announcement towards the end of 1935 of the proposals for the setting up of a Legislative Assembly in Palestine brought that country once more into prominence in the Iraqi press, and the effect of these proposals upon the Arabs of Palestine was closely followed by the literate public. 33. As time went on, the first clashes between Jews and Arabs brought to a head all the bitter feeling against Zionism which had been fermenting during the recent past, and news of Palestine from all sources began to fill the columns of the newspapers. Special broadsheets were published every evening for some weeks giving the latest news of the strike. The eagerness with which these were snapped up showed the deep interest of the Iraqis in the struggle. 34. Early in May a deputation of Senators and Deputies visited His Majesty’s Ambassador and handed to him a memorandum in which they expressed the grave anxiety of Iraq about the future of the Arabs in Palestine. Their spokesman expressed the conviction that the rights of the Palestinian Arabs could only be safeguarded by a restriction of Jewish immigration, and he begged Sir Archibald Clark Kerr to impress this view upon His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. He said that the fate of the Arabs in adjacent countries was a matter of great concern to their kinsmen in Iraq, and that any events which brought distress to their Muslim neighbours was bound to stir public feeling in Iraq. As Iraqis they were anxious to maintain and strengthen the existing good relations between their own country and Great Britain, but he feared that failure to find an early solution of the problem of Zionism in Palestine would react in a contrary sense. Other memoranda of protest, some unrestrained and mendacious, were received from a large number of clubs and societies in different parts of the country. Demonstrations and public meetings were wisely forbidden by the Government, but days of mourning and flag days were permitted and subscription lists were opened in many towns for the Arab victims of the struggle. Several thousands of pounds were collected in this way and sent to Palestine. 35. The attitude of the Government was throughout correct and helpful. They did their best to check the expression of public excitement and xenophobia, and to prevent attempts to pay off anti-Zionist scores on Iraqi Jews. At the same time the press was effectively restrained from publishing inflammatory material. In general the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs refrained from discussing the situation, but early in May, when Yasin was receiving urgent requests for help from all kinds of organisations interested in the Arab struggle in Palestine, he spoke formally on the subject to His Majesty’s Ambassador. He expressed the opinion that Jewish immigration was the vital issue. The Arabs in Palestine foresaw that if it was allowed to continue without restriction, they would be rapidly reduced to the position of a minority under the sway of an alien people whose intellectual and financial resources were far superior to their own. It was the dread of this fate which was now driving them to desperation. He understood the difficulties of His Majesty’s Government, and knew that strong influences were being brought to bear upon them from many quarters to find room for the Jews fleeing from Germany, Poland and Roumania. Nevertheless, he thought it his duty to give a friendly and serious warning that, in spite of the goodwill which the Arabs as a whole felt towards the British, His Majesty’s Government would see the present happy state of harmony between the two peoples much damaged if a solution of the Palestinian problem were not soon found. For reasons of internal policy and for the sake of their good relations with His Majesty’s Government, by which they set great store, the Iraqi Govern ment did not, he said, desire to be drawn into taking any action in the matter, but they might not be able indefinitely to resist the pressure that was being brought to bear upon them to champion the Arab cause. 36. In July, as the result of a proposal made by King Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia (Ibn Saud), that some sort of joint demarche should be made by Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the Yemen, with a view to help the restoration of normal conditions in Palestine, the Prime Minister broached the subject again with His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Bagdad. He explained that he had been discussing King Abdul Aziz’s proposal with the Saudi Charge d’Affaires, and had prepared a draft memorandum which he thought might be communicated jointly[14956] b 5 by the Iraqi and Saudi Governments to His Majesty’s Government. He would not, however, proceed further with this idea before knowing how His Majesty s Government would be likely to receive it. He did not wish to court a rebutt. Ine memorandum contained an appeal to His Majesty’s Government to suspend Jewish immigration until the proposed Royal Commission had made their report and an expression of the belief that if this were done the Arabs would abandon their campaign of violence. 37. Mr. Bateman was instructed to inform the Prime Minister that His Majesty’s Government were not prepared to make any pronouncement regard ing Jewish immigration into Palestine until disorders had ceased and law order had been restored. At the same time they appreciated the attitude which the Iraqi Government had taken in this matter and would be grateful for any further moderating influence which the Prime Minister could bring to bear on the Arabs. 38. Shortly afterwards, Nuri, having sought and obtained the concurrence of His Majesty’s High Commissioner in Palestine, made a private visit to Jerusalem. His object was personally to persuade the Supreme Arab Committee to call off the strike so as to allow the Royal Commission to set about their task without delay. He arrived on the 20th August, by which time it was clear that some device would have to be found to save the face of the k^upieme Arab Com mittee After some days of great activity Nuri arrived at a formula which might have served the purpose but for the fact that he had found it impossible to act other than in his official capacity as Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs^ His Majesty’s Government took the view that acceptance of Nun’s formula would give Iraq an undue voice in the affairs of Palestine and, while grateful for his intervention, they felt unable to accept his solution of the problem. It is only fair to note, however,' that the formula which was Anally found may be directly traced to Nuri’s initiative both at Jerusalem and later on at Geneva. 39. While Nuri’s proposals were still under consideration, the Supreme Arab Committee issued a manifesto urging the continuance of the strike until the rights of the Arabs had been won. His Majesty’s Government decided that, m these circumstances, immediate concessions were impossible and that the disoi ders must be brought to’ an end by force. Nuri left Jerusalem for Constantinople on the 30th August. 40. Early in September a Syrian named Fawzi al Qawukji, who for some vears had been serving in the Iraqi army, resigned his commission gathered together a band of some fifty armed men and joined the insurgents m Palestine. Despite the vigilance of the Iraqi Government he managed to take with him a considerable quantity of rifles and ammunition, and he soon became a conspicuous figure in the fighting which followed his arrival. He remained in Palestine until the disorders ceased, when he returned something of a hero to Iraq. 41. About the middle of September the despatch of a British division to Palestine and the accompanying threat of martial-law caused much anxiety to the Palestinian Arab leaders and, after consultation with Sir Arthur Wauchope at Jerusalem, they came to the conclusion that the only way to avert disaster was to invite the Kings of Saudi Arabia and Iraq and the Amir of Transjordan to issue an appeal calling for the termination of the strike. Negotiations were then opened by the Mufti with Bagdad, Riyadh and Amman. Upon the receipt of a number of suggestions from Nuri, who was actively pursuing his search for a formula at Geneva, Yasin took up the matter, and by the 10th October the terms of an appeal agreeable alike to His Majesty’s Government and to the three Arab rulers and acceptable to the Supreme Arab Committee in Palestine had been worked out and despatched to Jerusalem. Its effect was remarkable. Within a few days all serious disorder had ceased. So far as Iraq is concerned, the credit for this happy ending must be shared between the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Nuri’s share was a restless inventiveness : Yasin’s was tact, persistence and a welcome capacity for instant decision. 42. It should be noted here that, while His Majesty’s Government refused to give any undertakings whatever to the Arab rulers concerning their future policy in Palestine, they agreed that, after the termination of the strike and campaign of violence, they would be willing to receive any representations on the subjectmmm 10 of the Arabs in Palestine which the Arab rulers might care to put forward through the diplomatic channel. It was not long before the rulers began to consider how best to use this concession. Before the end of October Nuri had planned a visit to Riyadh to discuss with King Abdul Aziz what further representations the Arab rulers could make. The resignation of Yasin’s Cabinet on the 29th October prevented him from carrying out this project, but on the 7th November Dr. Naji-al-Asil, his successor at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, set out for Riyadh in his stead. He found King Abdul Aziz very critical of the decision of the Higher Arab Committee to boycott the Royal Commission, which had in the meanwhile arrived in Palestine, and, at His Majesty’s suggestion, he returned to Bagdad with a proposal that, subject to their first obtaining the approval of His Majesty’s Government and an assurance from the Mufti that there would be a favourable response, the three rulers should appeal to the High Committee to change their attitude and give every help to the Royal Commission in carrying out their task. His Majesty’s Government raised no objection to this proposal, and on the 19th December a small delegation of Palestinian Nationalists arrived in Bagdad to discuss it with the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Dr. Naji informed His Majesty’s Ambassador that the delegation were much impressed by the unanimity of the advice offered to them in all quarters to co-operate fully with the Royal Commission, and when they left for Riyadh on the 24th December in order to consult King Abdul Aziz-al-Saud the Minister was confident that they had been converted to the Iraqi point of view.(‘) Military Revolt. 43. Early on the morning of the 29th October, eleven Iraqi military aero planes flew over Bagdad dropping leaflets. These contained a manifesto appealing to King Ghazi, in the name of the army, to dismiss Yasin’s Cabinet and to set up a new Administration under Hikmat Sulaiman. It called upon all officials to leave their offices until the new Cabinet was formed, and suggested that the army might be compelled to take forcible measures if the Government were not at once dismissed. It was signed by General Bekr Sidqi, who described himself as the “ Commander of the National Forces of Reform.” 44. The movement had been carefully planned and the secret well kept. All but two battalions of the Iraqi army were gathered at Qaraghan for manoeuvres under Bekr Sidqi’s command, and Bagdad, stripped of troops, lay open and defenceless. The Chief of the General Staff, Taha-al-Hashimi, the brother of the Prime Minister, was in Angora and, on the day before, the whole of the Iraqi air force had been ordered out of Bagdad for combined exercises with the ground forces. 45. At about a quarter to 10 His Majesty’s Ambassador was called to the palace, where he found the King in a highly nervous state. His Majesty said that the events of the morning had taken him completely by surprise, and he produced a letter from Bekr Sidqi and Abdul Latif Nuri (the generals commanding the two divisions engaged in the manoeuvres), which had been brought to him by Hikmat Sulaiman. This letter reiterated the demands made in the leaflets, and added that if Yasin’s Cabinet did not resign within three hours Bagdad would be bombed from the air. His Majesty described the helpless condition of the capital, and indicated that resistance would be useless. At this point the Prime Minister and Nuri arrived at the palace. They, too, had been taken by surprise. Yasin calmly reviewed the situation and said that he was ready to resign if His Majesty wished him to do so. After glancing at and dismissing the idea of resistance, he suggested that an endeavour should in the first place be made to ascertain Hikmat Sulaiman’s intentions. This was decided upon and His Majesty’s Ambassador withdrew. 46. At about 11 o’clock five military aeroplanes passed over Bagdad and four bombs were dropped in the neighbourhood of the Serai. Three fell near the Prime Minister’s office and one into the river. Two passers-by were killed and several wounded. At 1 o’clock the Cabinet resigned and a Royal rescript was at once issued empowering Hikmat Sulaiman to form a Cabinet. By 5 o’clock ( x ) Early in January 1937 the Supreme Arab Committee asked to be given the opportunity to state the Arab case before the Royal Commission in Jerusalem.11 in the Serai. In the meantime the Cabinet had been completed and was composed of the following :— Prime Minister and Interior : Hikmat Sulaiman. Foreign Affairs : Dr. Naji-al-Asil. Finance: Jafar-abu-Timman. Justice: Salih Jabr. Defence : Abdul Latif Nuri. Education: Yusuf Iz-al-Din. Economics and Communications : Kamil-al-Chadirji. The public records of the new Ministers were unimpressive. 47. Shortly after the Prime Minister sent a message to His Majesty s Ambassador to the effect that he wished to maintain close and friendly relations with His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and that he hoped tor the support of the Embassy. 48. In the course of the evening Nuri Pasha slipped across the river in a row-boat and took refuge at the Embassy. He related that his brother-in-law, Jafar, had gone out in the morning to try to dissuade the generals from marching on Bagdad and had been shot. He believed that a group of army officers intended that night to murder Yasin, Rashid Ali and himself. He asked that he might remain in the Embassy until he could escape from the country. His Majesty s Ambassador thereupon asked the adviser to the Ministry of the Interior to go at once to Hikmat Sulaiman’s house and to warn him that, if any more murders occurred the effect in London would be so deplorable that he could not foresee the consequences. The Prime Minister sent back an emphatic assurance that he would not allow any of the members of the late Cabinet to be harmed, and at the same time expressed his distress at the murder of Jafar-al-Askari, for which e denied all responsibility. The next morning Sir Archibald Clark Kerr called on the Prime Minister, and the assurances which his Excellency gave of his belief in the necessity for close and friendly relations with His Majesty s Governmen and of his desire to have the help and guidance of the Embassy left, on the lace of it nothing to be desired. Hikmat Sulaiman also said that i asm and Kashid Ali had both agreed to leave the country, and that he had made arrangements tor their safe journey to the frontier. With the approval of the Prime Minister, Nuri and his family were flown at dawn next day to Egypt in a Royal Air lorce machine. On the evening of the same day Yasin and Rashid Ah arrived safely in Damascus. Murder of Jafar-al-Askari. the crime and gave his special personal protection to Ismail Tohalla. [14956]50. It would not be fair to Hikmat Sulaiman to say that he had any part in the affair. When he plotted the couf he could not have foreseen Jafar’s visit to the army, and when the news of Jafar’s murder was brought to him he refused to go on with the work of forming a Cabinet. Great pressure had to be brought to bear upon him to dissuade him from throwing his hand in. Circumstances have since obliged him to acquiesce in the shielding of the murderers. 51. No official statement has been made about Jafar’s death. A determined silence has been kept concerning the whereabouts of his grave. Causes of the Revolt. 52. There will always be room for speculation on the causes of the revolt. The leaders themselves said that it was an expression of the widespread dissatis faction with the Yasin Administration on account of— (1) The Government’s repeated recourse to military operations and martial law to put down tribal unrest; (2) The outrageous manner in which members of the Cabinet and their friends, particularly Yasin and Rashid Ali, had abused their position for personal gain; (3) The suppression of all political opposition and the muzzling of the press. 53. That Hikmat Sulaiman was moved by such things as this may readily be believed, and to them there may probably be added his irritation that Yasin should have persistently suspended his newspaper. He must also have dwelt with bitterness on the contrast between his own poverty and the wealth which some of the Ministers were said to have acquired. Indeed, the stimulus afforded by these reflections may have stirred him as much as his zeal for the public welfare. 54. Bekr Sidqi’s attitude is more difficult to define. He himself had com manded the operations on the Euphrates and had not flinched from hitting the tribes hard. His reputation as an ambitious, efficient and ruthless soldier did not suggest much concern for the finer aspects of good government, and he had appeared to be on friendly terms with the more important members of the Yasin Cabinet and their willing instrument. The same motives which might have influenced Hikmat Sulaiman could not logically be ascribed to Bekr Sidqi, and the association of these two men suggests the uncomfortable thought that the general’s main inspiration was probably ambition and that the overthrow of Yasin was only his first step along the road towards greater power. 55. It cannot be denied that there was some truth in the three formal indictments of the Yasin Administration. Since coming into office in March 1935 his Government had declared martial law no less than five times in different parts of the country and had constantly employed the army to deal with outbreaks of disaffection. Their worst record was on the Euphrates, where they had never been able to extricate themselves from the net of intrigue which Yasin and Rashid Ali had woven when, in 1935, they raised the Fatlah tribe to turn Ali Jaudat out of office. 56. The acquisitiveness of the Ministers was also a fact. Rashid Ali, as Minister of the Interior and Justice, controlled immense patronage, which he had turned to personal profit, and his nomination of himself as trustee of the Qadriyah Waqf provoked appropriate comment. By a number of clever devices Yasin had become possessed of large areas of Government land, but opinion is divided upon the question whether he had acted illegally in any given case. 57. Nuri had not acquired land, but he had built a large house, and the lavish expenditure of public money on the medical treatment of his son after an aeroplane accident at the beginning of the year had become somethino- of a scandal. 58. In the mattei of the press the Yasin Cabinet had been no more severe to their critics than former Governments, but they had twice rather unnecessarily suppressed a newspaper owned by Hikmat Sulaiman because of its attacks upon their policy. Soon after he came to power Hikmat himself found that the freedom of the press, by which he claimed to set so much store, was no com- foitable thing and he soon lesorted to the suppression of journals that were hostile to him.13 The Exiled Ministers. 59. After the flight from Bagdad, Yasin went to Beirut, Nuri to Cairo and Rashid Ali to Constantinople. The effects of their changed circumstances upon each one of them were characteristic. Yasin stayed calmly in Beirut and eschewed political activities. Rashid Ali, terrified by rumours of assassination, put a long distance between himself and Bagdad and sought safety in Nuri was restless and active until the end of the year. If he had had the goo sense to keep quiet he would soon have been offered a post. Hikmat buiaiman was attached to him and was anxious that he should not be out of the country for long. It had been Hikmat’s intention to appoint him to an Iraqi Legation until the emotions of the crisis were spent and he could perhaps be brought back to strengthen the Administration. But Nuri himself frustrated this plan. He began by inspiring articles in the Egyptian and foreign press against Hikmat Sulaiman’s Government and by writing feverish letters to all his friends in Bagdad, including His Majesty’s Ambassador and the adviser to the Ministry of the Interior, in which he sought to kindle distrust of the new Cabinet and sympathy and support for himself. These tactics did nothing but damage to himself and to his Iraqi friends. His next move was to try to payethe way for his return to political life in Iraq. Through the Egyptian Charge d Affaires in Bagdad (whose sister-in-law had married Nun-al-Said s son m the autumn) he let it be known that he was willing to forgive the murder of Jafar (his brother-in-law) and to come back to serve his country. It is doubtful whethei these overtures, coming on top of what he had already done to damage e Government, would have been successful. In any case, any chance of success was spoilt by his acquiescence in the ill-timed return, without permission from the Government, of Mme. Jafar, who had retired to Alexandria after the murder of her husband. She arrived suddenly one morning by air from Cairo, and the authorities, having reason to think that she would become a centre o intrigue, refused her permission to remain. She was accordingly sent back overland via Beirut. Nuri was deeply offended by Mme Jafar s expulsion, and once more gave vent to his indignation by means of bitter attacks in the press upon Hikmat Sulaiman. The result was still further estrangement Nun s financial difficulties were no doubt in some measure the cause of ^ 1S restlveness : and on more than one occasion His Majesty s Ambassador advised the Iraq Government that they would be wise to see that no difficulties were made about paying regularly to him the pension of LI). 50 a month to which he was entitled. Work of the New Government. 60 The first act of the new Prime Minister was to assure His Majesty’s Ambassador that he intended {a) fully to honour the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance and other agreements concluded by his predecessors with Great Britain and (b) to protect the interests of the minorities. He also saw Jo i‘ that assurances of the friendship of his Government were quickly given to all the othei representatives of foreign countries in Bagdad. 61. His next step was to ask the King to dissolve Parliament, whmh was due to reassemble on the 1st November. He then pardoned all tho ®® k ad Y ^tn sentenced to imprisonment by the military tribunals set u p u &lt; Administration. Three hundred and seventy-one prisoners in same time a large number of persons who had been placed u we eks various parts of the country were allowed to return to their homes_ A later steps were taken to restore to its original owners all the property wh c had been confiscated from the tribes by the military couits. 62. The Government’s programme was published on the 9th December. It professed to be a strictly practical programme of proaects which could be carried out in the near future. In fact, however it differed fro “ the Pro grammes of earlier Governments and contained far mor it ■ Ww note Hikmat Sulaiman and his colleagues are likely to be ® f station - was the improvement and modernising of every branch of the Administration special importance was given to agrarian reforms designed to distribute the Government-owned land among the peasantry and tribesmen. 63 The new Government also pledged themselves to strengthen the army and to extend the railway from Baiji to Tel Kotchek via Mosul with all possible speed. [14956] B 714 finance in London. Pan-Arab Movement. 65. During the first three months of the year there was a marked revival of public interest in pan-Arab ideals. This was in part due to events in the Eastern Mediterranean, and in part to official stimulus, ihe contemporary political developments in neighbouring Arab countries, the strikes and disturb ances in Syria, the proposals for the setting up of a Legislative Assembly in Palestine and the negotiations with Egypt were naturally given much prominence in the press and were used as a text for innumerable articles dwelling upon the common interest of the Arab peoples and the necessity for co-operation. 66. Public concern in the affairs of the Arab world was also kindled by visits paid to Iraq by several notables from Palestine and Egypt. Amil Ghaury from Jerusalem and Abdul Qadir-al-Mazini and Assad-al-Daghir from Lairo are examples. All these visitors were warmly welcomed by Arab and Islamic clubs and were given opportunities to address representative audiences on pan-Arab ideals. 67. As the year passed a series of events kept interest and enthusiasm alive. Three or four parties of students came to Bagdad from the Yemen. A party of Iraqi students made a conducted tour of Syria, Palestine and Egypt and were followed by a second party of notables and politicians. Then came the signing in Bagdad of the Treaty of Arab Brotherhood and Alliance between Iraq and Saudi Arabia with its explicit invitation to all other independent Arab States to join. 68. All this was exploited by the leaders of the pan-Arab movement in order to popularise the idea of Arab fellowship, to inculcate pride in the common heritage of the Arab race, and to arouse a determination to strive together for Arab liberty and prosperity in the future. 69. The fact that Iraq herself has made progress during the last decade and is free from the irksomeness of foreign political control undoubtedly gives the Iraqis a sense of pride, and places them in a position from which they feel able to help and encourage their neighbours to move along the road over which Iraq has already travelled. 70. Later in the year the clashes which occurred in Palestine between the Jews and the Arabs, though not directly concerned with the pan-Arab movement, evoked considerable popular feeling in Iraq (see paragraph 33.) During the summer and autumn a number of notable figures in the Arab world, including Muin-al-Madhi, secretary of the Supreme Arab Committee in Palestine, Saiyid Ahmad Zabara, Minister in the Yemen Court, and Saiyid Maruf-al-Arnauti, editor of Alif Ba of Damascus, visited Iraq and established contact with the political leaders of the country. 71. It is early yet to say with certainty what attitude Hikmat Sulaiman’s Government will adopt towards the pan-Arab movement. A few days after he came into office, the new Prime Minister told His Majesty’s Ambassador that he had little sympathy for grandiose schemes of Arab unity, but the strength of public opinion and doubts about his loyalty to the Arab cause which were expressed in the press of neighbouring Arab countries soon forced him to announce publicly the general interest of his Cabinet in the affairs of the Arab world. Nevertheless, by the death of Jafar and the eclipse of Yasin and Nuri, the pan-Arab movement in Iraq has lost, at any rate for the present, its most forceful leaders. 72. The first step taken in the new year in the matter of the resettlement of the Assyrians in Syria was the formation of the Trustee Board approved by the Council of the League in December 1935 to control the settlement operations in Syria. It consisted of a president and two members. The president and one A ssyrians.15 tcT member were appointed by the Council of the League of Nations, J 1 '' 1 was appointed by the French High Commissioner in Syria, In January the Trustee Board prepared a scheme for the removal to Syria during the yeai u report of 8,500 Assyrians and for the transfer of a further 7,000 m 1937. O f 8 500 to be moved in 1936 it was proposed to send in the spring 6,00( straight to the Ghab, and in the autumn to settle the balance of 2,500 Khabur until the Ghab drainage and reclamation schemes had been finisheU. Those sent to the Ghab were to be accommodated at first on land leased temporal i y for cultivation and later transferred to the reclaimed area, which, it was hoped, would be ready for occupation in 1940. The estimates proposed for the whole settlement operation showed a total expenditure of £1,146,000 for the fina resettlement of 15,000 persons. To meet this, the following contributions had been promised :— ^ The French Mandated Territories in the Levant ... 380,000 The United Kingdom 250,000 T rfln 250,000 The League of Nations 86,000 leaving a deficit of £180,000. In March the Archbishop of Canterbury made an appeal for public subscriptions to meet this deficit. 73 In the meanwhile, the local committee in Mosul had been consulting the Assyrians to find out how many wished to go to Syria By the end of February thev had finished the work except for the Assyrians m the districts of the Nahlah Valley, Barwari Bala and Nerva Raikan, which were inaccessible on account ot mud and snow. 74 Thev found that, with negligible exceptions, all wished to leave Iraq, and up to the end of February 11,650 persons had registered their desire to be transferred to Syria. 75. At the end of February the Committee of the League Council authorised the Iraqi Government to draw up and carry out in direct arrangement with e Trustee Board a programme of Assyrian movements f° r the year The q Government proposed as a first step the transfer to the Ghab of 1,500 of the Baz tribe. 76. Unfortunately, the Trustee Board had, in the meanwhile, found it difficult to acquire the land necessary for the temporary settlement of the immigrants pending the completion of the irrigation and other works on the Qhab which had to be finished before the Assyrians could be permanently settled theie. Strenuous efforts were made in Geneva, Pans and Beirut to overcome these difficulties, but, as time passed and little was achieved, it became evident that no solution would be reached before the heat of the summer put a stop to any further movements. 77. In the face of these delays and of the uneasiness to which they gave rise among the Assyrians themselves, the local committee in Mosul and the Trustee Board in Beirut strongly recommended to the Council Committee that sanction should be given for the immediate transfer to Syria of the ^500 Assyrians whose transfer for temporary settlement on the Khabur had been fixed for the an umm To this the Council Committee, after some hesitation, agreed, and the fiist convoy left Mosul for Syria on the 28th May. By the end of June 1,900 persons had been moved and the remainder were transferred in two convoys early m September The flocks and herds followed in December. In the meanwhile the consultation of the Assyrians regarding their wish to leave or to remain in ^ q had been finished. The final results showed a total of about 22,500 ex-Ottoman Assyrians in Iraq in 1936, which, with the 6,000 already accommodated temporarily on the Khabur, gave a total of 28,000 to be covered by the proposals of the League of Nations. 78 The movement of the 2,500 referred to above left the total in Iraq at 20,000.' Of these, about half opted for transfer to the Ghab and half postponed a final answer, but seemed disposed to remain in Iraq. 79. In June, however, the whole situation was suddenly ch ^ d - Towards the end of the month the Council Committee received a report fiom the Fienc [14956] B 816 Government drawing attention to a number of difficulties which had been encountered by the mandatory authorities in Syria regarding the Ghab scheme. The principal of these were the lack of land for the temporary settlement of the Assyrians pending the completion of the draining and other works in the Ghab area itself, the additional costs of the necessary engineering works revealed by fuller investigation, the high cost of the anti-malarial measures found to be essential, and the political complications created by the prospect of the early termination of the French mandate in Syria. The trench representative on the committee, in explaining the French Government’s note, recommended that, in view of the gravity of the difficulties which it revealed, the Ghab scheme should be abandoned. 80. The committee had no alternative but to accept this set-back to their plans, and on the 4th July the Council, on the recommendation of the committee, adopted a resolution agreeing to the final abandonment of the Ghab scheme. At the same time they instructed the committee to continue their efforts, and in particular to undertake a general study of the situation and to report to the Council in September whether it was possible to find any other place in which it would be practicable to settle the Assyrians of Iraq who still wished to leave the country. 81. The question next came before the Council on the 25th September. The Council Committee had no new schemes to put forward, but hoped to be able to do so at a later date. The committee’s budget for 1937 was also discussed. The estimated expenditure was 1,800,000 French francs for maintaining the Khabur settlement, 420,000 French francs for outstanding debts, and 280,000 French francs for further efforts to find a place for the permanent settlement of the Assyrians—a total in all of 2,500,000 French francs. The committee expected to have in hand 1,500,000 French francs, leaving a balance of new money to be found of only 1 million French francs. Of this, the Iraqi share worked out at about I.D. 4,000, which the Government were persuaded to accept. Yazidis. 82. Daud-i-Daud, the leader of the insurrection which took place in the Sin jar in September 1935, remained throughout the year a fugitive in Syria. Some sixty of his tribesmen are believed to be with him. On the anniversary of King Ghazi’s birthday about twenty-five Yazidis who had been banished to other parts of Iraq were permitted to return to their villages. Of those imprisoned, twenty-nine were released on the anniversary of King Ghazi’s accession, 125 about a month later, and the rest (about 200) were all released under the general pardon of court-martial convicts issued when Hikmat Sulaiman’s Cabinet assumed office. 83. At the end of April a number of the Qiran and Sammoqa Yazidis under Khidr Agha crossed into Syria. Apparently they hoped to be accommodated in villages vacated by some of the Jubur who had come into Iraq. This threat to their homes sent the Jubur hurrying back into Syria, and the French and Iraqi frontier officials were then able to negotiate the return of the Yazidis in a spirit of neighbourly co-operation. 84. During the winter of 1935-36 a dispute developed between Sheikh Ajil of the Shammar and two of the Yazidi chieftains about the boundaries of their lands. The Mutessarif of Mosul prevented trouble by a decision fair to both sides, and he also intervened to prevent the Shammar from penetrating into the Sinjar by buying up plots of land in Yazidi villages. Kurds. Barzan. 85 After a protracted pursuit, Khalil Khoshawi, with the last remnants of the forces which, in 1932, had gathered under the banner of Sheikh Ahmad of Barzan, was shot on the 13th March in a skirmish with the Iraqi police. His brother and three other men were killed in the same engagement, and six others were captured. This success wms the result of the concerted movements under taken by Iraqi and Turkish frontier forces, which put an end to Khalil’s favourite gambit of moving rapidly from one side of the frontier to the other.[14956] b 9 17 The remaining scattered groups of his band were soon afterwards easily rounded up, and it may be hoped that peace will now return to the much devastated Barzan area. 86. On the 21st March, on the occasion of King Ghazi’s birthday, all those who had been banished from the disturbed area during the operations against * Khalil Khoshawi were permitted to return to their homes, and in November all Barzanis who had been imprisoned by court-martial sentence were released under the general pardon proclaimed by Hikmat Sulaiman s Government. Kurdish Nationalism. 87. During the year under review, political activity in Sulaimani, the strongest centre of Kurdish national feeling, has shown a marked change. The local men of influence, instead of being united as hitherto by a common, if vague, national sentiment, have been gradually drawn into the web of Bagdad party intrigue. Improved communications have made it easier for the influence of current political development to be felt in Southern Kurdish areas, and wheie once there was nothing but talk of Kurd and Arab, there are now many who/ speak of their allegiance to this or that political party or leader in Bagdad., This change has done no harm. In present circumstances Kurdish nationalism can bring little good to the Kurds, and it is on the whole better that they should be occupied with the party game than with the chimera of Kurdish independence. \ Jews. 88. In the early autumn the prolonged struggle of the Arabs of Palestine against Zionism provoked an unpleasant reaction in Iraq. In spite of the efforts of the Government to repress any demonstrations against the Jews, the more fanatical Arab elements began to show signs of getting out of hand. The first incident, which occurred at the end of August, was the sniping of the principal Jewish club in Bagdad. There were no casualties. About a month later, how ever, a leading Jewish citizen—a personal friend of the Prime Minister was murdered in the main street of Bagdad. Although the police at once made arrangements to provide special protection for the Jews, this murder was followed by a number of similar outrages in which at least seven more Jews were killed, including one at Basra. Some of these murders had no direct political motive, but it seemed certain that the murderers made use of the situation to awenge private grievances under the cloak of political passion. The Government issued a communique denouncing these outrages and increased the police precautions in the Jewish quarter. In spite of an expression of confidence by the Chief Rabbi in the goodwill of the Government, the Jews became greatly alarmed and on two occasions suspended work, remaining shut up in their houses throughout the day. After the fall of the Yasin Government no further incidents of this kind took place, and the Jewish community made no secret of their pleasure at the change. The reason for this was not quite clear. Yasin’s Government had apparently acted with energy to prevent the spread to Iraq of the quarrel between the Arabs and the Jews in Palestine. They had suppressed several newspapers which had tried to stir up popular anger against the Jews, and they repeatedly refused permission for anti-Zionist meetings and demonstrations. Nuri, when in Bagdad, had been particularly active in favour of the Jews, who certainly had no complaint against him. The explanation given by the Jews themselves was that although the Government as a whole had acted correctly, individual members, particularly the Minister of the Interior, had frequently extorted large sums of money from the community as the price of their protection. Stories of this kind are easily put into circulation, are difficult to investigate and must be accepted with reserve. 89. In 1935 the Anglo-Jewish Association came into possession of a bequest to the value of about £40,000, the annual income of which was to be used for sending promising Jewish students from Iraq to England and elsewhere in Europe to finish their education. During the year His Majesty’s consul at Bagdad, at the request of the association, set up a small committee composed of three prominent members of the Jewish community to make nominations for the scholarships made available under this bequest. Two young Jews were sent to London for training in pedagogy, and grants of money were made to several others who had already entered universities in England.Death of the Nagih. 90. Saiyid Mahmud, Naqib-al-Ashraf and Trustee of the Qadiriyah Waqf, died in Bagdad on the 21st July. A few days later Royal rescripts were issued appointing his brother, Saiyid Asim, to succeed him as Naqib-al-Ashraf, and Rashid Ali-al-Gilani to be trustee of the Qadiriyah Waqf. The separation of the functions of Naqib and trustee of the Qadiriyah Waqf was a departure from precedent, and Rashid Ali’s assumption of the control of the large revenues of the Qadiriyah properties and endowments was much criticised. This arrangement was reversed in December by Hikmat Sulaiman, who cancelled Rashid Ali’s appointment and restored the administration of the Qadiriyah Waqf to the Naqib. Abolition of Titles. 91. A law was passed by Parliament at the end of the session of 1935-36 prohibiting the official use of all foreign titles, including Pasha, Beg and Effendi. A committee was then set up to advise the Government what common form of address should be adopted. They recommended the general use of the term “ A1 Saiyid ’ 5 (pronounced “As Saiyid’’) as the equivalent of the English “Mr.” No official decision had been taken on this point before the end of the year, but the address “ A1 Saiyid” had been commonly adopted in all official corres pondence and the Protocol Department of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs advised the diplomatic corps to use this form in addressing correspondence to the Minister for Foreign Affairs or any member of the Ministry. Education. 92. In the autumn sixteen more Egyptian teachers and a number of Egyptian doctors were recruited for service in the Iraqi schools. The Egyptian professor, Dr. Sanhuri, who was appointed Principal of the Law School at the beginning of the year, resigned at the end of the summer term and a successor had not been chosen before the year ended. 93. At the beginning of the autumn term a special school was opened to coach candidates for the London matriculation examination and three well qualified teachei s were recruited from England to conduct the course. Two more teachers were also brought from the United Kingdom to teach English in the secondary schools. 94. Mr. Wheldon, who was seconded from the Board of Education to advise the Iraqi Government on technical education, began his work in January and continued until the end of the summer term. His return in the autumn was delayed on account of uncertainty regarding the plans of the Ministry of Education for the future of technical education and it was finally decided that for a variety of reasons, it would be best to terminate Mr. Wheldon’s services in Iraq. No arrangements had been made to appoint a successor before the end of the year. 95. A noteworthy feature of the school year was the introduction into the secondary schools of military training on O.T.C. lines. The boys were given uniforms, a leather equipment and service rifles. They drill and fire an elementary musketry course each year. The innovation is said to be popular. 96. Stories are current of anti-British propaganda spread through inaccurate and tendentious teaching of history in the secondary schools These are being investigated. What is certain is that there has been an increase in the amount of German taught in the schools and privately during the last two years. Archaeology. 97. The following expeditions were excavating during the season 1935-36 : — 0r 1 ie ? t ¥ 1 Institute of the University of Chicago, at Tel Asmar, Khafaje and Ischale. The Forschungs-Gemeinschaft at Warka. ™ Th&lt; ? P hil a del P hia Museum and the American School of Oriental Research, Bagdad, at Fappa Gaura (near Khorsabad).19 [14956] b 10 98. In the autumn of 1936 the three organisations mentioned above returned to continue their work and a further expedition, sent out by the University of Michigan, arrived to work at Tell Umar and Seleucia. 99. A new Antiquities Law, which replaced the law of 1924, came into force in April. In general, it differed very little from the previous law, but a new feature was the provision made for a kind of suspense account of duplicate objects from which suitable gifts may be made to expeditions to compensate them for such unique antiquities as may be taken from them for the Bagdad museum. J ustice. 100. Early in the year the question of filling two vacancies in the cadre of foreign judicial experts came under discussion. 101. The Iraqi Government were quite willing to take the necessary steps to fill one of these vacancies, but they were reluctant to recruit the second jurist because experience had shown that a ninth judge was superfluous. They appreciated, however, that they could not reduce the cadre from nine to eight judges without the concurrence of the Council of the League. They therefore decided to approach the Council with the object of obtaining an amendment to article 12 of the declaration of guarantees which would render the appointment of a ninth foreign jurist unnecessary. 102. The matter came before the Council at their 93rd session in September and, in accordance with the recommendations of the rapporteur, it was decided that in future Iraq should employ only eight foreign jurists instead of nine. Thereupon an eighth British judge—Mr. Rowan Aitken—was recruited and has been appointed to the court at Baquba. 103. There is evidence to show that Hikmat Sulaiman is aware that justice has not always been impartially administered in the recent past. He has asked that instances of illegal pressure on judges should be brought immediately to his notice and is particularly anxious that the British judges should help in bringing such cases to light. Public Health. 104. The Yasin Government showed some interest in the question of the improvement of public health. The 1936 budget included the sum of I.D. 128,000 for building new hospitals and dispensaries under the five- and three-year capital works plans. In January the Prime Minister asked His Majesty’s Ambassador to obtain the services of an expert to advise upon the reorganisation of the Health Department, but the Government did not proceed with this plan. 105. During the summer Bagdad was, for the first time in living memory, visited by a malaria epidemic which provoked much justifiable public criticism of the Health Department. The Government were pressed from all sides to take energetic measures to combat the epidemic. Very little was actually done and many doctors fear that, unless exceptional steps are taken at once, the disease will become endemic in Bagdad. 106. On assuming office, Hikmat Sulaiman declared himself greatly con cerned about conditions of public health and was for a time inclined to the view that the best course for the Iraqi Government to pursue would be to recruit a number of new specialists, possibly amongst the Jewish refugees from Germany. His predecessor had shown a similar inclination during the summer and was persuaded with difficulty to abandon it. Hikmat Sulaiman appealed for advice to His Majesty’s Ambassador, who informed him that, as the present Health Directorate was chaotically inefficient, it was clear that the first task of the Government ought to be to reorganise it so as to eliminate the improper political influences, nepotism and rapid changes in personnel which were at the bottom of the existing maladministration. Health Directors and Inspectors should not be content with staying in Bagdad, but should go out into the provinces and take a personal hand in combating the general uncleanliness that conduces to the spread of hook-worm, malaria, tuberculosis and venereal disease which are widespread throughout the country. The Prime Minister seemed impressed by this advice and at the end of the year requested His Majesty’s Ambassador to help in drawing up a concrete plan of workable proposals.20 Distinguished Visitors. 107. The well-known Egyptian banker, Tallat Harb Pasha, came to Bagdad in April. He stayed for ten days, making expeditions by air to Mosul, Basra and Kut. Everywhere he was flattered and generously entertained. Much was expected from his visit (although no one seemed to know quite what), but it apparently led to nothing, except possibly the completion of arrangements for the extension of Misr Airworks’ service to Bagdad. 108. The Patriarch of the Syrian Orthodox Church came to Iraq in May from Aleppo. He visited Mosul, Kirkuk and Bagdad and exchanged calls with the Ambassador. His visit had no political importance. 109. In June the Sheikh of Bahrein, accompanied by two sons, passed through Iraq on his way to England. He stayed for two days in Bagdad, where he was the guest of the Iraqi Government. 110. In October the Commander-in-chief of the East Indies Station, Vice-Admiral the Hon. Sir Alexander Maule Ramsay, visited Basra and after wards spent a few days at the Embassy in Bagdad. The Commander-in-chief entertained King Ghazi on board the flagship at Basra. 111. The Afghan Minister for War passed through Iraq in October on his way from Turkey to Tehran. He was the guest of the Iraqi Government. Unhappily he reached Bagdad on the day of the military revolt against Yasin-al-Hashimi’s Government. He and his suite narrowly escaped being hit by the bombs which were dropped on the Serai. The Minister, who had intended to stay until the 1st November, left for Iran on the following morning. 112. Dr. Schacht, the German Minister for Economics and Director of the Reichsbank, spent the night of the 19th November in Bagdad and flew on to Tehran the next morning. On his return, a few days later, he passed a night in Bagdad. At a dinner party in the German Legation he met the Iraqi Minister for Finance. He made attractive offers of long credits for the purchase in Germany of the railway material needed for the immediate future. III.— Foreign Relations. British Empire. General. Death of King George V. 113. The news of the death of King George V was received in Iraq with what seemed to be widespread and genuine regret. King Ghazi was represented at the funeral of the late King by his uncle, the Amir Zaid. A memoi’ial service held at Hinaidi in the presence of His Majesty’s Ambassador and the Air Officer Commanding was attended by representatives of the Royal House, the Government and the army; by a deputation from the Chamber of Deputies; by the entire diplomatic and consular corps, and by a large number of Iraqis, as well as by the British colony in Bagdad. Abdication of King Edward VIII and Accession of King George VI. 114. The events leading up to the abdication of King Edward VIII were treated with discretion, understanding and sympathy by the Iraqi press. King Ghazi sent a telegram of congratulation to King George VI on His Majesty’s accession. British War Graves in Iraq. 115. The Iraqi Parliament passed on the 19th April a law ratifying the War Graves Agreement of the 15th March, 1935, and enabling it to be put into effect. 116. It had at one time been proposed to include in this law a clause providing that the Imperial War Graves Commission should, within a year, communicate to the Iraqi Government a complete list of the cemeteries, &amp;c., covered by the agreement. This clause was, however, withdrawn when His^2) 21 Majesty’s Ambassador pointed out that it imposed on the Commission an obliga tion which, though reasonable in itself, was out of place in an Iraqi law. 117. General Sir Herbert Hart, who was appointed Deputy Controller of the Imperial War Graves Commission for the Near East in succession to I Colonel C. E. Hughes, was not able to visit Iraq before the end of the year. No meeting of the local committee was held in 1936. United Kingdom. Iraqi Representative in the United Kingdom. 118. Soon after Hikmat Sulaiman came to power, the Iraqi Government decided to replace Ali Jaudat as Minister in London by Rauf Chadirji. The King’s agrement was signified at the beginning of December, but Rauf Chadirji had not left Bagdad by the end of the year. Royal A ir Force. 119. On the 6th August the Ministry for Foreign Affairs were informed that His Majesty’s Government were prepared to agree that the Royal Air Force cantonment at Mosul should be handed over to the Iraqi Government in October {i.e., a year in advance of the time laid down in the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930), subject to the acceptance by the Iraqi Government of certain conditions, of which the principal concerned the retention of the supply depot by the Royal Air Force to serve as a rest house for British air personnel for the duration of the treaty. 120. Prolonged discussions took place with the Iraqi Government, and it was not until the 13th October that agreement was reached. The move to Dhibban of No. 30 squadron was completed in November, and the cantonment at Mosul was formally handed over to representatives of the Iraqi Government on the 2nd December. 121. In October His Majesty’s Ambassador informed Nuri that the progress in the construction of the new Royal Air Force cantonment at Dhibban had been under review. Although work was well advanced, it seemed probable that the accommodation at Dhibban for Air Headquarters, the Air Force Hospital and the wireless station could not be completed by October 1937. It was therefore hoped that the Iraqi Government would agree to the retention of these units at Hinaidi for a short period after that date. No reply to this communication had been received by the time the Yasin Government fell, but at the end of November a note was received from the new Government agreeing to the Embassy’s proposal. A ir Defence Force. 122. In February the Prime Minister raised with His Majesty’s Ambassador the question of the Air Defence Force. He explained the reasons for which it would be difficult for the Iraqi Government to give effect to the arrangements set out in Nuri’s secret letter of the 30th June, 1930, to the High Commissioner, especially now that a conscription law had been passed and was being put into effect. Yasin suggested that some other means should be found to carry out article 4 of the annexure to the 1930 treaty. A number of meetings were held by representatives of the Royal Air Force and Iraqi Government to consider the practical implications of the various schemes suggested by Yasin as possible alternatives, and, when in London early in June, Nuri discussed the matter both at the Foreign Office and at the Air Ministry. It was clear, however, from what he then said that he and Yasin were not in agreement as to the best line to follow, and after his return to Iraq the matter was allowed to lapse. Military Mission. 123. Major B. H. C. Lea-Wilson, R.A.M.C., was temporarily loaned to the Iraqi Government in the summer in connexion with the desired reorganisation of the Iraqi Army Health Service. Colonel M. Everett, D.S.O., succeeded Colonel H. C. Allen, D.S.O., as instructor at the Staff School. There were no other changes among the Army and Air Force officers attached to the mission. No less than'five additional Royal Air Force non-commissioned officers were loaned for service with the Iraqi Air Force, who also re-engaged a former Royal Air Force warrant officer as instructor. [149567 b 1122 124. As the contracts of the present British officers were to expire early in 1937, the composition of the military mission came under review in the autumn. It had been the intention of the Yasin Government to reduce the cadre, but in December His Majesty’s Embassy were officially informed by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that the Government intended to keep the mission up to its present strength, with the exception of the post of Inspector of Cavalry, which was to be abolished. Purchase of Armaments in the United Kingdom. 125. Late in 1935 the Iraqi Government ordered eighteen aircraft from Hawkers (Limited), and early in 1936 the number was brought up to twenty-two. Though some delays occurred in delivery, and were unfavourably commented upon by the Iraqi Government, all but eight of the machines had been supplied before the end of the year, and it is understood that the new Government have decided to order two more aeroplanes of the same type. In November the Ministry of Defence sent an order to the de Havilland Company for ten “ Tiger Moths,” which will, it is understood, be used at the new flying training school. 126. In June Yasin told His Majesty’s Ambassador that the Iraqi Govern ment wished to order in the United Kingdom the armament requirements for two new divisions at a cost of about £900,000, delivery to be completed within two years. The Prime Minister at first suggested that payment should be made by instalments spread over a number of years, but, when the financial complications of such an arrangement were explained to him, he agreed that cash should he paid on delivery. In spite of this concession. His Majesty’s Government were unable to close with the proposal as it stood, since their own urgent needs resulting from the new rearmament programme, prevented them from giving the desired guarantee as to delivery within two years. On the 1st October the matter was referred to the Defence Policy Requirements Committee, who, fully alive to the importance of meeting Iraqi requirements in full, requested to be supplied with details of the equipment needed. They suggested that, as the defence programme of the United Kingdom was spread over three years, the Iraqi Government could scarcely expect their demands to be satisfied within a lesser period. 127. On the 8th October Yasin handed to His Majesty’s Ambassador an estimate of the requirements for the two divisions (including arms, ammunition, engineering equipment, mechanical transport and aircraft), and said that the Iraqi Government would now be prepared to spread their programme over three years. 128. After the cou/p d'Etat, His Majesty’s Ambassador was informed by the new Minister of Defence that it was not intended to proceed with the former Government’s plan for creating two new divisions. The idea of the new Chief of the General Staff was, he said, rather to complete the establishment and modernise the armament and equipment of the existing two divisions. The estimate handed to Sir Archibald Clark Kerr by Yasin was accordingly cancelled, and a revised list of the material required as a result of the new defence scheme was received from Dr. Naji-al-Asil on the 21st December. The list, although duly forwarded to London, did not appear to be detailed enough to allow of very positive comment by His Majesty’s Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs was warned by His Majesty’s Ambassador that further information would be required before orders could be placed with the manufacturers. 129. In addition to Iraqi commitments in respect of orders placed with the War Office, there exist Iraqi requirements (to a total of £35,800) in respect of miscellaneous war material. As these demands did not appear to have been made the subject of actual commitment, His Majesty’s Ambassador enquired in November of the Ministry of Defence whether the new Government wished to confirm them. He received a reply to the effect that the demands had been duly provided for in the budget, and that the Iraqi Government regarded themselves as committed to their purchase.[14956] b 12 Delays in deliveries of Armaments. 130. Owing to the failure of munition firms in the United Kingdom to fulfil their contracts on the promised dates, there were regrettable delays in the delivery of certain armaments (rifles, howitzers, machine guns and ammunition) which had been ordered by the Iraqi Government through the agency of the War 4 T Office. 131. Several strongly worded protests in regard to these delays—some of them based on exaggerated versions of the facts—were addressed by the Iraqi Government to His Majesty’s Embassy in the course of the year, with the result that energetic steps, crowned with a large measure of success, were taken in London to hasten the delivery of belated consignments. 132. On the 9th May the Prime Minister told Mr. Bateman that the lack of machine guns was hampering operations on the Euphrates and that he had con sequently authorised the Minister of Defence to secure a supply from Czecho slovakia, in order to supply a deficiency caused by the non-delivery of a consignment of Vickers machine guns ordered in 1934. A little later it was found that the Iraqi Government had in fact placed with the Skoda Company an order for 200 Bren light automatics of the type used in the British army, due for delivery in the following December. 133. In the meantime, 100 of the machine guns ordered from Great Britain had been shipped to Basra, but for the most part without the necessary mountings (which had formed part of a separate order). In order to allay irritation on this score and to supply the needs of the Iraqi armed forces as promptly as possible, the War Office supplied the missing tripods from their own stock, and promised to make every effort to expedite the delivery of the remaining 100 machine guns. 134. In July it came to the ears of His Majesty's Chargd d’Affaires that the Iraqi Government had followed up their purchase from Czechoslovakia by placing with a Belgian firm an order for 200 Vickers machine guns and acces sories. Mr. Bateman, as a result of enquiries made both privately and through the Foreign Office, was able to inform the Prime Ministei and the Minister of Defence that these guns were probably old, part worn and of doubtful service ability. The Ministry of Defence, who had been assured that the guns were new, thereupon appointed a commission to visit Belgium for the purpose of examining and, if necessary, refusing to accept delivery of the consignment. The facts turned out to be as suspected and the order fell through. 135. A further complaint was received from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in December regarding alleged delays in the delivery of armaments. It was, however, largely based upon a misunderstanding of the facts and on this occasion His Majesty’s Ambassador was happily able to point out in his reply that no real cause for grievance any longer existed and that much of the material in question was already in the hands of the Iraqi Ordnance Department. 136. None the less, it would be idle to deny that the delays referred to above, though for the most part rectified before the end of 1936, had an unfortunate effect on the Iraqi mind. They gave rise to many exaggerated rumours, which were eagerly exploited by the trade rivals of Great Britain, who had lately been particularly active and who were glad of the opportunity offered them of holding out the temptation of easy bargains and long-term credits. Iraqi elements ill- disposed towards the alliance took the occasion to spread abroad rumours to the effect that Great Britain desired to keep Iraq in a weak condition. Owing, how ever, to the energetic steps taken by His Majesty’s Government to regain lost ground, confidence in Great Britain’s fyonesty of purpose seemed to have been largely restored by the end of the year and, although the danger of the Iraqi Government’s deciding to place her orders for armaments elsewhere cannot yet be excluded (it loomed very large at one moment of the year), the Iraqi authorities seemed at the end of 1936 to have every intention of continuing to deal with British firms. British Officials. 137. The Iraqi Government continued to recruit new officials from the United Kingdom in cases where special qualifications were required. Such24 appointments included two officers for the new Government meteorological service and a topographical surveyor, besides a number of English teachers and engineers. A new judge was also appointed to take the place of Mr. Weldon, who had resigned. Arrangements were also made for visits to Iraq by experts to advise the Government on the proposed erection of an oil refinery and to consider methods of improving the quality of Iraqi tobacco. In the latter case the expert selected was an American subject employed in the British American Tobacco Company. 138. The number of British officials employed by the Port of Basra and Eao Bar Dredging Service increased from fifty-four to seventy-five. At the end of the year there were thirty-six British officials of all grades employed in the Iraq Railways. Training of Iraqi Officials in the United Kingdom. 139. In addition to courses for army and air force officers, which are men tioned elsewhere in this report, courses were arranged for Iraqi officials at the Meteorological Department of the Air Ministry, the Royal Air Force Central Medical Establishment and the Training School, Post Office Research Branch. Law for the Restriction of Certain Trades to Iraqis. 140. In a letter to the Prime Minister of the 4th January, His Majesty’s Ambassador made it once more clear that, in the view of His Majesty’s Govern ment, the Bill empowering the Government to issue regulations to restrict the exercise of certain trades to Iraqis, which had passed its third reading in the Chamber of Deputies, was, by reason of its disregard of the acquired rights of foreigners, in conflict both with the special obligations assumed by the Iraqi Government in their Declaration of Guarantees to the League of Nations in 1932 and with the accepted principles of international law. His Majesty’s Ambassador suggested that the only practicable way of meeting these objections to the Bill would be to exempt from its scope all persons engaged in the trades concerned at the time of the law’s entry into force. 141. On the 13th January Yasin informed His Majesty’s Ambassador that the legal advisers to the Iraqi Government did not share the view of His Majesty’s Government, and that he must proceed with the Bill. He nevertheless repeated various assurances as to the position of British and British Indian subjects, and said that he was considering the introduction of an article into the law which would exclude from its provisions the subjects of the States in whose territories Iraqis were allowed freely to practice their crafts and trades. This amendment was duly introduced in the Senate and the Bill passed into law in February. It was deemed to be a tolerably satisfactory solution of the question so far as His Majesty’s Government were concerned, for it covered the large number of British Indian subjects engaged in trade in Iraq. 142. In October a notice w'as published ordering foreigners engaged in a large number of occupations to register with the Ministry of the Interior. It was explained to His Majesty’s Embassy that the purpose of this order was to enable the departments concerned to obtain the statistics which they had decided to be necessary before they could draft regulations to bring the law into practical effect. Some uneasiness was, nevertheless, caused by this notice among the persons concerned. 143. On the 19th November, after the formation of the Hikmat Sulaiman Cabinet, His IVIajesty s Ambassador informed the new IMimster for Foreign Affairs of the various undertakings which he had received early in the year from the previous Government on the subject. «These were :— (a) That, in view of the important British interests involved, His Majesty’s Embassy should be consulted before any regulations were issued to give effect to the law; &amp; (h) That all foreigners employed by the Royal Air Force should be exempted from the law; and r (c) That the Iraqi Government should use the discriminatory powers given them by the law to safeguard the position of British and British Indian subjects.[14956] B 13 25 144. On the 12th December Naji-al-Asil informed His Majesty’s Ambassador that the law was giving rise to so many difficulties that the Iraqi Government were seriously considering a proposal to allow it to become a dead letter. Insurance Companies Law. 145. Considerable anxiety was caused in the United Kingdom at the beginning of the year by the terms of a Bill regarding insurance companies operating in Iraq, consideration of which had already been begun by the Iraqi Parliament. One clause of the Bill laid down that such companies should make large deposits with a bank approved by the Ministry of Finance. In a letter to the Prime Minister, dated the 10th February, His Majesty’s Ambassador explained in detail the objections felt by United Kingdom companies to the Bill, and expressed the hope that they would be exempted from making the required deposit if a certificate from His Majesty’s Embassy were provided in each case stating that the company had complied with the regulations of the United Kingdom insurance legislation. In particular, the Prime Minister’s attention was invited to the position of Lloyd’s underwriters, who are actually prohibited by their constitution from making deposits abroad. 146. In reply the Prime Minister said that it was not possible to discriminate in favour of British companies, but His Majesty’s Embassy were authorised to consult with the British financial adviser and see what could be done to meet the objections of the insurance companies. Mr. Hogg pointed out that the Bill did not specify that the bank with which the deposits were to be made need be in Iraq, and he suggested that companies should ask the Ministry of Finance for authority to make their deposits in London. He said that it had never been intended to include marine insurance in the scope of the Bill, and he proposed a draft amendment to make provision for its exclusion. 147 Action on these lines would have removed the more serious objections of His Majesty’s Embassy to the Bill. Unfortunately, the necessary amendment was not, in fact, introduced before the Bill passed its final reading m May and became law. It is understood that this omission was due to a misunderstanding. 148. Some difficulty was caused by the detailed regulations arising from the law, but these were overcome in the summer. 149 The Government of Yasin proposed to introduce an amending law in the next session of Parliament, which would, among other things, regularise the position of Lloyd’s underwriters. These plans were, however, upset by the change of Government in October and the dissolution of Parliament which followed. Transfer of the Iraq Railways. 150. The negotiations, which had been begun in the summer of 1935, for an agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Iraqi Government providing for the transfer to the latter of the ownership of the Iraqi railway system, were brought to a successful conclusion early in the \ear. 17th February His Majesty’s Ambassador communicated to the Prime Minister a draft text embodying the understandings reached in 1935. Discussions continued smoothly on the basis of this text, and the agreement was signed on the evening of 31st March by His Majesty’s Ambassador and Nun who had just returned to Bagdad. On the same day Lieutenant-Colonel J. K. lamsh, C.B.E., V D left Bagdad on the conclusion of the period of his service as Director of the Iraq’ Railways and a Royal iradah was issued appointing m his place Colonel J. C. Ward, C.M.G., C.I.E., D.S.O., Director of the Port of Basra. 151. In its final form the agreement provided (1) That the railway system should be transferred to the Iraqi Govern ment as a going concern. . TT . ^ , (2) That a cash payment of £400,000 should be made to His Majesty s Government. (3) That the Iraqi Government should accept responsibility for all liabilities relating to the railways, provided that His Majesty’s Government would refund one-fifth of any claim that might be established, “ the subject- matter whereof existed before the date of the tiansfei. It was laid down26 in a confidential exchange of notes that this proviso referred only to a possible claim by the Bagdad Railway Company in respect of the section of the line built before the war between Bagdad and Samarra. (4) That for twenty years the management of the railways should be entrusted to a board appointed by the Iraqi Government and invested by legislation with adequate powers. (5) 1 hat, of the five members of this board, one, besides the general manager, should be a British subject. (6) That for twenty years the following positions should be filled by British subjects :— (a) General manager. (b) Inspector-general of traffic. (c) and (d) Chief engineer and his assistant. (e) and(/) Chief mechanical engineer and his assistant. (7) In an exchange of notes published at the same time as the main agreement it was laid down— (a) I hat a number of further posts should be occupied by British subjects for periods of ten and five years; and (b) That, if the Iraqi Government desired to engage further foreign personnel, they should normally engage British subjects. (8) In an exchange of confidential notes, the Iraqi Government agreed that material of United Kingdom manufacture or production would be purchased to meet all future requirements of the railway system, provided that suitable material was forthcoming on reasonable conditions. 152. Finally, His Majesty’s Ambassador addressed a confidential note to the Minister for Foreign Affairs informing him that, before ratifying the agreement, His Majesty’s Government would have to satisfy themselves that the powers attributed to the railway board by Iraqi legislature were adequate to enable it effectively to control the railways. In point of fact, although the Iraqi Government had, naturally enough, declined to say so in writing, the terms of the legislation to be introduced into the Iraqi Parliament had been previously agreed upon between the two Governments. 153. The agreement was at once submitted to the Iraqi Parliament, the session having been prolonged for that purpose. Although its provisions were attacked in some quarters, the Bill authorising the ratification of the agreement and conferring the necessary powers upon the railway board had by the 14th April passed both Houses with large majorities and without amendment. Ratifications were exchanged by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires on the 9th July, when Mr. Bateman addressed a note to Nun, m which he stated that His Majesty’s Government had seen the powei s conferred by the Iraqi Parliament on the railway board, that they were ratifying the agreement because they considered these powers adequate, and that they would theiefore expect to be consulted if there was any question of alterin 0, these powers during the period of twenty years. The Railwav Board was set up by a decree of the Council of Ministers on the 14th July 'and the sum of £400,000 was paid to His Majesty’s Government on the 27th July. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires was therefore authorised to inform the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the ownership of the railway system had been transferred to the Iraqi Government as from the latter date. 154. In November His Majesty’s Ambassador raised the matter of the railway agreement with the new Prime Minister, who had taken a prominent part in the attacks on Yasin at the time of its conclusion. Hikmat Sulaiman explained that he had attacked his predecessor, not because of the terms of the agreement, but because, when in opposition, Yasin had always criticised those who tried to come to terms with His Majesty’s Government in similar circum stances; and he assured His Majesty’s Ambassador that there need be no fear V of the new Government trying to go back on the agreement. United Kingdom and Indian Customs Duties on Iraqi Dates. 155. From the beginning of his tenure of office in 1935, Yasin had appealed to His Majesty’s Ambassador to do all possible to secure the removal or reductionof the customs dues charged in the United Kingdom and India on imported Iraqi dates. He considered that these dues acted as a deterrent on sales of a staple Iraqi product and that His Majesty’s Government could hardly expect the Iraqi Government to do anything to restrict the import of Japanese piece-goods into Iraq and thus indirectly favour Manchester goods, unless they were willing, for their part, to help stimulate Iraqi products. 156. During 1935 and 1936 tentative negotiations proceeded with the idea of discovering whether the Iraqi Government would be willing to grant a quota for British cotton piece-goods, but these came to nothing, mainly because the Iraqi Customs did not feel competent to work a quota system. At the same time, the Iraqi Cabinet were definitely considering drastic steps to redress the unequal balance of trade between Iraq and Japan, and they were anxious that His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India should, motu proyio, take measures which would facilitate the recanalisation of trade between Iraq and Great Britain and India rather than between Iraq and Japan. 157. Neither His Majesty’s Government nor the Government of India were averse in principle from going some way to meet the Iraqi Government, and their proposals were still under consideration when, in May, the Iraqi Government published a customs regulation prohibiting the entry of certain Japanese goods (mainly textiles and silk) unless the importer could prove the export to Japan (for home consumption) of Iraqi produce, other than oil, to 15 per cent, of the value of Japanese goods due for clearance up to the 31st March, 1937, and 25 per cent, up to the 31st March, 1938. 158. When this regulation came into force, there seemed to be a chance for Manchester to regain lost ground in Iraq, but what actually happened was that every endeavour was made by Iraqi merchants to export Iraqi goods up to the amount required so as to secure the continued import of Japanese goods at the same rate as before. A brisk trade in import permits sprang up in the bazaar. 159. In February the Government called for tenders for the construction of two steel bridges over the Tigris at Bagdad. The lowest British tender (Messrs. Holloway’s) was some £34,000 higher than that of their nearest non- British competitor (Messrs. Kampsax). The Prime Minister was anxious that the contract should be awarded to a British firm and suggested to His Majesty’s Ambassador that he would be more easily able to get his colleagues to agree if he could show that His Majesty’s Government were willing—especially in view of the customs regulations mentioned above—to remove the duty charged on Iraqi dates imported into the United Kingdom. 160. This suggestion was sympathetically considered by His Majesty’s Government, who proposed, however, that as the effect of the restriction on Japanese imports could not be known for many months, the Iraqi Government should, in addition to awarding the bridge contract to Messrs. Holloway, so amend the Iraqi customs tariff as to favour the importation into Iraq of light British cars. 161. In August His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires opened negotiations with the Iraqi Government for an agreement whereby, in exchange for the removal of the United Kingdom duty on imported Iraqi dates, the Iraqi duty on imported motor vehicles would be changed from an ad valorem basis to one by which duty was assessed according to weight and horse power. At the same time he warned the Iraqi Government that His Majesty’s Government reserved the right to revert later to the importation of British piece-goods into Iraq if, in fact, there were found to be no improvement in this respect. 162. These negotiations had gone a long way towards fruition when the Yasin Government fell. The new Government awarded the bridge contract to Messrs. Holloway, but by the end of the year had not pressed for continuance of the negotiations for a customs agreement. Civil Procedure Convention. 163. Ratifications of the Anglo-Iraqi Civil Procedure Convention, signed at Bagdad on the 25th July, 1935, were exchanged in London on the 18th November. The convention came into force in respect of the United Kingdom on the 18th December.28 British Council. 164. His Maiesty’s Embassy presented a number of lecture gramophone records to the Ministry of Education on behalf of the British Council and also arranged for various technical and other publications to be supplied tree o± charge to selected Iraqi institutions. India. Pilgrims. 165. As a result of the official recognition of the Najaf-Medina route for the transport of pilgrims to the Hejaz and the prohibition of other land routes for this purpose, the question arose of the security to be provided by those pilgnms who, intending to return by a different route, were not provided with return tickets. The Iraqi Government seemed disposed to regard the present arrange ment, whereby such pilgrims pay a deposit of I.D. 18 (I.D. 10 more than pilgums with return tickets) as unsatisfactory. His Majesty’s Embassy informed the Ministry that they were willing to raise the deposit payable by British subjects concerned to any sum which the Iraqi Government might desire. Ehey pointed out, however, that any considerable increase would have the inevitable effect of deterring Indian pilgrims from visiting Iraq. 166. When, in May, the Iraqi Government suggested that Iraqi visas should be issued to all classes of travellers to Iraq, including those jpuineying on pilgrim passes,’’ the Government of India agreed to comply with the Iiaqi Government’s suggestions in the following manner :— pilgrims via Bombay to be required to obtain Iraqi visas on their “ pilgrim passes ” from the Iraqi Consulate-General at Bombay. (2) In the case of other ports, visas for Iraq to be given by the British authorities. (3) In both cases the Iraqi visa of 10 gold francs to be charged and, in the case of visas granted by the British authorities, the sums realised to be retained by the Government of India. The Iraqi Government agreed to the arrangements suggested and the necessary instructions were issued by the Government of India to all officials concerned. Ary a Samaj. 167. The Arya Samaj, a Hindu religious body registered in accordance with the requirements of Iraqi law, started work in September 1934 on a meeting hall in Bagdad. Work on the building was, however, stopped by the mutessarif in the following month on the ground that its completion, in the inflamed state of Moslem opinion, might lead to a disturbance of public order. In May 1936 His Majesty’s Ambassador handed to the Prime Minister a memorandum in the course of which he pointed out that, as a result of the suppression of the mischievous Hidayah newspaper, feeling against non-Moslems, and especially Hindus, had largely died down and that there no longer seemed any reason to apprehend trouble if the building were completed. During the summer, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires extracted a promise from the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the society would be allowed to build in Bagdad West. This promise had not been officially confirmed by the end of the year. Palestine. Iraq-Palestine Customs A greement. 168. The negotiations for the conclusion of a customs agreement between Iraq and Palestine, designed to increase traffic by the Bagdad-Haifa route, continued during the year and were brought to a successful conclusion. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom were able beforehand to obtain the required assurances that Palestine’s right to grant special customs facilities to Iraq would not be called in question by any of those countries towards which she had incurred obligations by her accession to commercial treaties between them and Great Britain. The agreement, which was concluded on the 14th December by means of an exchange of notes between His Majesty’s Ambassador and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, will come into force on the 14th February.It provides for the allotment of a free zone to the Iraqi Government at the port of Haifa and for the appointment of Iraqi customs officers. The duty on certain imports from Iraq is reduced, while other imports are exempted from duty. It also provides for the maintenance of the Bagdad-Haifa motor track. The agreement is valid for three years, after which time it may be renewed if so desired. Palestinian Jews. 169. Difficulties arose during the year regarding the admission to Iraq of Jews from Palestine and in transit to Palestine. A party of professors from the Hebrew University, who desired to study ancient manuscripts in Kurdistan, were politely refused entry. The people principally affected, however, were parties of Jewish immigrants from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, who were refused visas by the Iraqi consular authorities in Iran. Representations were made by His Majesty’s Embassy to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, but it was there explained that, while no unfriendliness towards His Majesty’s Government was intended, public opinion in Iraq was so inflamed against the Zionists that it was thought unwise to permit the passage of Jewish immigrants. The Director-General of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs said that if any case of unusual hardship was brought to his attention, he would see what he could do about securing a transit visa, but it subsequently transpired that a definite order had been issued early in the year to all Iraqi consuls in Turkey, Iran and India to refuse facilities to Jews on the way to Palestine. Visit of Iraqi Delegation. 170. A party of Iraqi notables visited Palestine in March and received an enthusiastic welcome from the Moslem population. In a series of indiscreet speeches, Said Thabit, who was one of the party, urged the Arabs to continue their “ struggle for freedom,” adding that Iraqi independence could not be fully assured until Palestine and Syria were also free. Yasin subsequently informed His Majesty’s Ambassador that, on Said Thabit’s return, he had severely rebuked him for his indiscretions. Transjordan. 171. The Iraqi authorities, whose attention had been drawn to the difficulties experienced by residents of Transjordan in obtaining visas for this country, issued orders in September permitting the entry of Transjordan nationals without visas, provided that their passports were duly endorsed at Ramadi. It was not found possible, however, to extend this privilege to all residents in Transjordan who had their passports endorsed at Amman. Afghanistan. 172. In October the Iraqi Government consulted His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom regarding a proposal made by the Iranian Government that the scope of the proposed Middle Eastern Pact of Non-Aggression should be extended so as to include Afghanistan. His Majesty’s Government preferred to express no opinion on the matter. 173. No more was heard of the protocol mentioned in paragraph 43 of the report for 1935, although the Iraqi Government were informed that His Majesty’s Government found the draft unexceptionable provided that it were made less ambiguous. Egypt. 174. Relations between Iraq and Egypt were exceptionally cordial in 1936. The conclusion of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of Alliance in September, although adversely criticised in some quarters, was generally held in Iraq to be an event of the highest importance for the Middle East and for the pan-Arab movement. In August Nuri expressed the view that, through their common alliance with Great Britain, Iraq and Egypt could be considered virtually as allies of each other. This being so, he considered it essential for the two Governments to study means of evolving a common cultural and military doctrine and of improving communi cations between their respective countries. These views were discussed with the new Egyptian Minister, Abdul Rahman Azzam, who was at that time in Bagdad.30 175. Conversations between the Iraqi and Egyptian Governments were started with a view to the conclusion of a commercial agreement between the two countries on the basis of most-favoured-nation treatment. His Majesty’s Embassy were consulted, and they reminded the Iraqi Government of the desirability of their including in any such agreement a formal reservation in respect of special customs concessions accorded to neighbouring or ex-Ottoman countries. 176. A regular telephone service between Iraq and Egypt was opened in April by an exchange of greetings between the Iraqi and the Egyptian Prime Ministers. 177. The Director-General of Public Health went to Egypt in the summer and recruited a number of doctors for service in various capacities under the Directorate of Health. Some half-dozen Egyptian legal and educational specialists—including Dr. Sanhuri—had been appointed earlier in the year. They had been engaged to fill posts left vacant by departing Syrians. There was, in fact, a very noticeable tendency for the Iraqi Government to turn to Egypt—rather than, as hitherto, to Syria—for light and leading in technical matters. 178. The appointment to Bagdad of Abdul Rahman Azzam as Egyptian Minister was very favourably received. He was already well known in Iraq as an Arab patriot. His arrival was made the occasion of exceptional festivities. France. 179. M. Paul Lepissier, who for six years had acted as French Charge d’Affaires in Bagdad, presented his letter of credence as Minister Plenipotentiary on the 18th January. 180. The decision of the French Government to follow, in Syria, the example of Great Britain in terminating the mandate gave great satisfaction in Iraq, where the press indulged in a pardonable exercise of self-praise. The terms of the Franco-Syrian Treaty were, however, freely criticised, and it was suggested in various newspapers that, while the form of the Anglo-Iraqi alliance was there, the spirit was lacking. 181. The various agreements that have been in negotiation between Iraq and Syria made progress during the year, but the French Minister is convinced that the Iraqi Government will delay signature until they are satisfied that Syria is free of the French yoke. 182. Soon after the couf d'Ftat, M. Blanquet, director of the R£gie in Syria, came to Bagdad and endeavoured to persuade the Iraqi Government to allow him to undertake the construction of the new railway extension from Mosul to Tel Kotchek on the Syrian frontier. His offer, though none too attractive, was receiving consideration at the close of the year. Germany. Commercial Treaty. 183. The instruments of ratification having been exchanged at Bagdad on the 30th May, the Commercial Treaty of 1935 entered into force on the 11th June. German Forward Policy. 184. A distinct change in the methods of the German Minister, Dr. Grobba, has become noticeable since his return from leave in Germany in 1935. It is understood that, suspected of not being an ardent enough National Socialist, he was, during his stay in Berlin, saturated with Nazi ideas. The results became visible in the more aggressive cultural and commercial policy which he has adopted throughout the year. Commercially, he has been aided by the discounts allowed on German exports through the Haavara system, but Dr. Grobba has been careful not to invade markets which have been pre-eminently British. Culturally, he has had to depend largely on his own ingenuity and has achieved no little success through the media of the cinema and language teachers. The fact that delays31 had occurred in the delivery of war materials ordered from the United Kingdom predisposed Iraqis to listen to him more than before. 185. In spite of the efforts of the German Legation, German commercial competition in Iraq is not yet serious. But this may not be so for very much longer. ^ After the visit in the autumn of Dr. Schacht, it was feared in some quarters that * his offer of unlimited credits might result in contracts being placed in Germany for much of the material required for new railway development in Iraq. But subsequent events proved that there was little ground for these fears. The first large orders for steel products were placed in the United Kingdom early in 1937. 186. German manufacturers attempted to enter the Iraqi market on a barter basis and one firm of manufacturing chemists succeeded in inducing the Health Department to order German chemical products in exchange for cotton. The deal was, however, called off by the Ilikmat Sulaiman Government. ; Bagdad Town-planning Scheme. 187. When the suggestion for the employment of Mr. Alfred Bossom, M.P., as adviser to the Government on the replanning of Bagdad fell through, the Iraqi Government, in August, offered this post to a German professor, Herr Brix of the Charlottenburg Technical High School. Professor Brix, who accepted without demur the very modest remuneration offered, consented to draw up a plan as desired and arrived in Bagdad in November. He told the Government, on whom he made a good impression, that his scheme would not be intended for immediate adoption but would be of such a nature that it could be gradually put into effect as funds became available. Appointment of Dr. Rosenau. 188. In July, Yasin Pasha proposed to engage a German Jew—one Dr. Rosenau—to work under the Directorate of Health as a specialist in haematology. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires reminded Yasin of the obligation of Iraq under the Treaty of Alliance to consult His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom before making appointments of this kind. The appointment was not, in fact, made. Iran. Frontier Dispute. 189. In August 1935, the Shah had favoured a proposal that Iran should accept the existing Perso-Iraqi frontier in return for the cession to her by Iraq of an adequate anchorage at Abadan. This suggestion, which had the great merit of simplicity, seems temporarily to have lost its attraction during the confused negotiations between Iranian and Iraqi delegates which began at Bagdad in December 1935 and continued their desultory course until after the recall of M. Samii at the end of March 1936. Much time was spent in vain on the discussion of the proposed Convention for the conservancy and navigation of the Shatt-al-Arab. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom desired the conclusion of such a convention, but only on condition that they should be a signatory, and that they should be represented on any board of control set up thereby. 190. In January, there seemed good reason to suppose that the Iranian Government would be prepared to accept a tripartite convention, but later in the year it become clear that the Iranian Government would insist on claiming half the river and would oppose any arrangements which would give Great Britain an effective voice in the control of the Shatt-al-Arab. Indeed, they appeared to be encouraged by the non-committal attitude of the Iraqi Government to endeavour to exclude Great Britain from the picture altogether. 191. His Majesty’s Government were frequently consulted by the Iraqi Government but found it difficult to give any useful advice, owing to the fact that neither party seemed willing to come out into the open. They made it clear, however, that— (a) should a comprehensive settlement prove impracticable, they did not wish their desire for a conservancy convention to stand in the way of a possible land frontier agreement, and(b) they had no objection to the Iraqi Government ceding an anchorage at Abadan, provided that the right of merchant ships and the ships of war of Iraq and her allies to pass through the ceded waters at all times was not infringed, and that adequate arrangements were made for dredging in the ceded waters until such time as a conservancy board should be set up. 192. After the departure of the Iranian delegation in April and the arrival of the new Minister, Mudhaffar Alam, negotiations were continued through the diplomatic channel. Little headway was made, however, as the Iranians would not accept the Iraqi suggestion that Great Britain should be a signatory to the proposed Tripartite Conservancy Convention for the Shatt and a member of the Board which this Convention was intended to create, nor would they agree to place the lower reaches of the Karun River and the whole of the Bahmanshir waterway under the control of the Board. 193. The position of the negotiations was discussed by Nuri and the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs when they met at Geneva in September. M. Aras was anxious that the non-aggression pact initialled at Geneva in the autumn of 1935 by Iraq, Iran and Turkey should be signed and brought into force as soon as possible, and he appreciated that it was difficult for Iraq to sign the pact before her frontier dispute with Iran had been settled. He proposed, therefore, that a date in March should be fixed for the final signature of the pact and that if there seemed to be no possibility of a comprehensive settlement by that date of the frontier dispute and the dependent difficulties of the administration of the Shatt, Iran and Iraq should limit their immediate objectives to the conclusion of a short treaty in which Iran would recognise the existing frontier in exchange for the cession by Iraq of an anchorage at Abadan. 194. Nuri Pasha adopted this suggestion and was about to send a note to the Iranian Government on these lines when the change of Government occurred on the 29th October. On the 28th November his successor handed to the Iranian Minister a note making clear-cut proposals. The note stated that, in order to make possible the signature of the non-aggression pact before the 21st March, 1937, it seemed desirable to conclude without delay a treaty settling the question of the boundary on the following lines :— (a) The recognition by Iran of the original boundary throughout its length from the Turkish frontier to the open sea, and (b) The grant by Iraq to Iran of an anchorage at Abadan, subject to certain safeguards regarding freedom of navigation and rights of dredging. The note went on to suggest that the pact for non-aggression between Iran, Turkey, Iraq and Afghanistan should be signed immediately after the conclusion of the treaty, and that the two Governments should undertake to open immediate nego tiations for the conclusion of a convention regarding navigation and conservancy. I he proposal was also made that the following conventions should be negotiated as soon as possible :— A Neighbourly Relations Convention, A Residence and Nationality Convention, A Consular Convention, An Extradition Convention, A Convention for Judicial Assistance, and A Post and Telegraph Convention. The Turkish Government were asked to support the new proposals in Tehran. 195. No written reply had been received by the end of the year, but the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs meanwhile took expert advice on the maximum limits of any anchorage which could safely be ceded at Abadan without injury to British and Iraqi rights and interests. Quarantine. 196. There were some signs of a return by Iran to the aggressive policy which ended in the Iraqi appeal to the Council of the League in December 1934. In July, the Iranian Government lodged an official protest with the Iraqi Govern ment against independent Iraqi action in the matter of quarantine formalities33 jM- for ships in the Shatt-al-Arab on the ground that this contravened “ Iranian sovereignty over and rights in the Shatt that they were contrary to certain articles of the International Sanitary Convention; and that they disturbed the status quo contrary to the undertaking given by Nuri to the League in January 1935. The Iraqi Government sent two notes in reply. The first, dated the 4! 11th July, asked the Iranian Government to explain the exact meaning of the reference to Iranian sovereignty in the Shatt, adding that they had no knowledge of any international document supporting such a claim. The second stated that the International Sanitary Convention not only entitled but obliged the Iraqi Government to take measures for sanitary inspection in the Shatt; that the articles cited by the Iranian Legation contained nothing which could be held to modify the sovereign rights of Iraq over its national waters; and that it was impossible for the Iranian Government to maintain that the adoption of loutine health measures therein in any way made the settlement of the frontier dispute more difficult. The note ended with an allusion to recent Iranian incursions over the Iraqi frontier and hinted that the Iraqi Government might find it necessary to bring these breaches of the peace to the notice of the League. Frontier Posts. 197. In June a fresh incident involving violation of the Iraqi frontier occurred when Iranian police established posts both at Banawa Suta and m the village of Masud. Protests were made, at first without effect, by the local authorities, and also by the Iraqi Government, but in October Nun told His Maiesty’s Ambassador that the Iraqi Government had accepted the suggestion made by the Iranian Government that a mixed commission should be appointed consisting of three Iranian and three Iraqi officers to investigate the position of the frontier posts. The same commission would also investigate Iranian grievances regarding frontier brigand bands. The facts that the suggestion should have been made seemed to show a better spirit on the Iranian side and when in September, the Minister for Foreign Affairs complained about the construction of a police post in the north of the Kut Liwa he at once received a conciliatory reply promising redress. Towards the end of the year the Iranian posts in the Banawa Suta area seemed to have been moved to a point closer to, but well inside, the Iraqi frontier. Nothing more was heard, however, ot the proposed commission. Italy. Italy and the Italo-Abyssinian Conflict. 198 The rapidity of the Italian success in Abyssinia produced an impression of alarmed bewilderment in Iraq. The position of Great Britain was fully appreciated, however, and Italian propaganda made little visible headway. In spite of a tendency in some quarters to dwell on Great Britain s lowered prestige the general effect was the same as that in Egypt, viz. to make Iraqis realise' the beiiefits of their alliance with a Power having preponderant interests in the Near East. Fear of Italian machinations was one of the mam impulses underlying Nuri’s peace efforts in I alestinc. 199 When in May, the Italian representative at Bagdad officially informed the Iraqi Government'of the assumption by Italy ^ ufh JulfreX Ethiopia the Government decided to make no reply On the 14th July reguia- Gons were issued by the Iraqi Government to give effect to the recommendation ^Assembly of the League of Nations that the imposition of sanctions should be discontinued. Diplomatic Relations. 200 The Italian nationality of Princess Azzah’s hall-porter bridegroom together with the setting of her romance at Rhodes and the alleged presence of an ItS official at the wedding at Athens, led to an -crease in the eehng of irritation against Italy to which the invasion of Abyssinia had given rise. I fie unhelpful attitude adopted by the Italian Government when asked for ttem assistance to obtain an annulment of the marriage proved to be the last straw and led in June to the withdrawal of the Iraqi Minister in Rome. But the affair soon h ew over Muzahim-al-Pachachi returned to his post in September, and m34 November the Italian Legation, which had been empty since the spring (when Signor Porta, the Charge d’Affaires, had left Iraq) was filled by a fully accredited Minister, Commendatore Gabbrielli. 201. In the letter of credence, which the new Minister presented on the 5th December, the King of Italy was described as “ Emperor of Ethiopia.” His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, who were consulted, advised that mere acceptance of a document for which King Victor Emmanuel III was alone responsible could not be taken as implying recognition of His Majesty’s right to the new title. The Iraqi Government accepted this advice and decided that no special step was necessary to indicate their attitude towards the Italian claim. Iraqi interests in Italy. 202. In accordance with the wish of the Iraqi Government, His Majesty’s consular officers ceased, as from the 15th February, to protect Iraqi interests in Italy and were instructed henceforth to direct all Iraqi nationals to the Iraqi Legation in Rome. Nevertheless, His Majesty’s consular officers at Naples and Trieste were authorised to continue to grant visas to Iraqi nationals. Protest against the Anglo-Iraqi Railway Agreement. 203. In June the Italian Legation in Bagdad lodged an official protest with the Iraqi Government against the stipulation, contained in the first exchange of notes attached to the Railway Agreement, that preference should be given to British subjects when foreign personnel for the railways was recruited. The Italian Government alleged that this was a violation of the principle of equal treatment for all States members of the League which had been guaranteed in the declaration to the League of May 1932. A similar, but less categorically worded complaint, was received at the Foreign Office from the Italian Embassy in London. Suitable replies were returned in London and Bagdad explaining the reasons why both His Majesty’s Government and the Iraqi Government could not admit that the Italian contention was well founded. Koweit. Smuggling. 204. The anti-smuggling measures taken by the Iraqi Government met with considerable success, but in the early months of the year encounters between police and bands of land smugglers were frequent and consignments of contraband were seized by the Iraqi customs police. During the troubles on the Euphrates in the spring there were frequent allegations that Koweitis, with the connivance of the sheikh, were smuggling arms to the insurgent Iraqi tribesmen. These allegations, though without foundation, increased the prejudice of Ministers against the sheikh. 205. The most serious of the encounters between the police and Koweiti smugglers was that which took place on the 25th June. Five tribesmen were killed on this occasion, but the incident appears to have taught the Koweitis a lesson, for, during the rest of the year, smuggling decreased noticeably and seemed to be carried out by small caravans only. Frontier Incidents. 206. Early in January His Majesty’s Embassy, at the request of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, made representations to the Iraqi Govern ment in regard to an incident which occurred in September 1935, when three Koweiti woodcutters in a dhow were arrested by the Iraqi authorities, supposedly in Koweiti waters, and were kept in prison until December owing to their inability to pay the fine required of them. As a result of frequent interviews with the Prime Minister, His Majesty’s Ambassador was successful in June in persuading the Iraqi Government to appoint the British deputy-inspector of police at Bagdad to hold an enquiry into the incident at Basra. Major Cones reported that the boat had been seized in Iraqi and not Koweiti waters . 207. In September the Sheikh of Koweit reported that an Iraqi customs launch had entered Koweiti waters off Bubiyan Island on the 29th and 30th August. Enquiries made by His Majesty’s Embassy of the Director of Customs(a) Undertake, in writing, to make no claim for arrears of taxation against either sheikh in respect of his properties in Iraq, and 35 % at Bagdad showed, however, that his Excellency’s information was incorrect and that the launch had not in fact left Iraqi waters. 208. After making due allowance for exaggeration and inaccuracy on the Koweiti side, there seems little doubt that, from time to time, the Iraqi customs ^ police did violate the frontier in their pursuit of suspected smugglers. As the summer advanced complaints became more frequent, and between the 26th August and the 19th September no less than six cases were reported by the sheikh. 209. The new Government, although equally concerned about the smuggling problem, showed greater readiness than their predecessors to investigate these allegations and to issue stringent orders to the frontier police concerning the inviolability of the frontier. 210. Various suggestions were made during the year with a view to place relations between Iraq and Koweit on a more satisfactory footing. In July the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf put forward the proposal that a mixed committee, consisting of the Mutessarif of Basra and the Political Agent at Koweit, should be set up to enquire into all the incidents that had occurred on the frontier since April 1933 involving complaints either by the Iraqi Govern ment or by the Sheikh of Koweit. After examination of this and similar proposals, an interdepartmental meeting in London recommended that efforts should be made to mark the frontier by inter visible posts and to set up a small committee which would enquire into all reported incidents in future as and when they occurred. Yasin’s Government fell before it had been possible for His Majesty’s Embassy to consult Nuri about these suggestions. 211. The new Prime Minister, however, complained to His Majesty’s Ambassador within a week of coming into power about the smuggling nuisance and asked for his co-operation in divising measures to bring it to an end Inasmuch as smuggling was the root cause of all the difficulties with Koweit, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr felt that no useful purpose would be served by making any suggestions concerning the frontier to the Iraqi Government unless they were accompanied by definite proposals in regard to smuggling. He accordingly informed the Foreign Office that, in his opinion, there would be reasonable hope of obtaining a comprehensive settlement if the following proposals were made to the Iraqi Government simultaneously and without delay :— (1) Prevention of smuggling (on the lines of the prospective Koweiti-Saudi agreement). (2) Settlement of the date gardens question (on the lines suggested by His Majesty’s Embassy, cf. paragraph 213 below). (3) The appointment of a mixed committee to deal with frontier incidents. (4) The appointment of a commission for the delimitation and demarcation of the land frontier between Iraq and Koweit. At the end of the year these proposals were still under consideration. Properties of the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah. 212. The suggestions hitherto made for a settlement of the difficulties connected with the properties in Iraq of the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah having fallen on stony ground, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom suggested, early in the year, that definite proposals should be made de novo with a view to the settlement of these complicated questions. 213. In June, after much discussion with the Foreign Office, His Majesty’s Embassy were authorised to put forward completely new proposals based on the application of the Iraqi land settlement law. These were embodied in a note to the Iraqi Government of the 8th July, the tenor of which was as follows :— a) Taxation. His Majesty’s Government are prepared to make no further claim against the Iraqi Government for the exemption of the properties of the two sheikhs from taxation in Iraq, provided that the Iraqi Government will, for their part—36 (b) Provide a formal written assurance that no discriminatory taxation will be imposed upon the properties of either in the future. (2) Possession. His Majesty’s Government suggest that the Iraqi Government should— (a-) Immediately declare the areas in which the lands in question are ^ situated to be settlement areas, in accordance with the terms of the Land Settlement Law of 1932, and (b) Nominate a British land settlement officer to carry out the procedure laid down in this law whereby, after full and impartial investi gation, a formal title of possession would be awarded to the sheikhs and boundaries of their lands would be delimited and subsequently registered by the Tapu Department. These proposals were under consideration by the Yasin Government at the time of its fall on the 29th October and though the new Government are apparently anxious for a general settlement, they have not yet had time to consider the matter in detail. Heirs of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. 214. The Prime Minister told His Majesty’s Charg6 d’Affaires in July that two of the late sheikh’s sons had informed him that their father, before his death, had expressed a wish to present 2,000 rifles, which were stored in his house at Koweit, to the Iraqi Government. Enquiries were made at Yasin’s request, through the Political Agent at Koweit, regarding the attitude which the Sheikh of Koweit would adopt towards the proposed removal of the rifles. His Excellency’s reply was to the effect that he would have no objection to their being removed with proper legal authority, but that he could permit no action which would lay him open to possible claims from the other members of the family. 215. Yasin Pasha, whose anxiety about the whole affair was due less to his desire to possess the rifles than the fear that they might fall into hostile hands, then told His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires that he would like, himself, to have a heart-to-heart talk with the sheikh about this and kindred subjects. Mr. Bateman did all that he could to encourage the interview for which Yasin eventually decided to ask and which would have taken place on the occasion of his visit to the south at the end of August had not unfortunate telegraphic delays made it impossible to arrange. Service of Documents. 216. In January Nuri Pasha raised with His Majesty’s Ambassador the question of the Sheikh of Koweit’s position in regard to civil suits, pointing out that, while his Excellency was able to file suits in the Iraqi courts through powers of attorney given to his agents, no actions could be brought against him as he would not accept the service of any documents. A list of the cases said to have been held up as a result of the uncompromising attitude of the sheikh subsequently forwarded to His Majesty’s Embassy by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The Foreign Office, on being consulted, admitted that it was not possible to deny that, in cases where titles to real property were involved, international law admitted an exception to the general rule conferring upon sovereigns immunity from process in foreign courts of law. 217. In the special circumstances, however, they could not agree to assist service in any way as this would be inconsistent with the pledge which they had given to Sheikh Mubarak in 1914. 218. At the end of the year this matter had become less urgent owing to the death of the principal claimant against the Sheikh of Koweit. If the Iraqi Government accept the proposals put forward by His Majesty’s Embassy in the note of the 8th July concerning the sheikh’s .properties, all the outstanding cases will fall to be dealt with by the Land Settlement Officer and/or the Special Court of Appeal set up under the Land Settlement Law. It is hoped that the Iraqi Government will eventually agree that this court should be that over which Judge Lloyd presides at Basra.37 (|Ofc&gt; Saudi Arabia. Treaty of Alliance. 219. On the 2nd April a Treaty of Alliance and Arab Brotherhood, which conflicted in no way with the other commitments and obligations of Iraq, was j w signed in Bagdad between Iraq and Saudi Arabia. The treaty, which was published simultaneously in Mecca and Bagdad, was well received and passed through the Iraqi Parliament without difficulty. Ratifications were exchanged / at Riyadh on the 13th November. 220. The main feature of the treaty is that it provides for mutual support in the case of offensive action by a third State. With this end in view, provision is also made for co-operation with a view to unify the military systems of the two countries. Another clause stipulates that both States will endeavour to secure the adherence of the Government of the Yemen to the treaty. Other independent Arab States may accede to the instrument on request. Visit of the Foreign Minister to Riyadh. 221. The Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs paid a visit to Riyadh in November, mainly to demonstrate to Saudi Arabia that the new Iraqi Government meant to continue the foreign policy of their predecessors. In addition Ito exchanging ratifications of the Treaty of Alliance mentioned above, he con- | eluded a convention dealing with passports, visas and residence. The text has { not been published. 222. The demarcation of the frontier and the division of the neutral fcone were also discussed. Owing to the difficulty about transferring the ownership of wells traditionally the property of tribesmen who are now Iraqi subjects, it was found impossible to make much progress with the second of these questions, but some advance was made towards a solution of the frontier difficulty. 223. During this visit King Abdul Aziz impressed upon Dr. Naji the desirability of inducing the Yemen to accede as soon as possible to the Treaty of Alliance and suggested that the Iraqi Government could best help to bring this about by sending a delegation to the Yemen. The Iraqi Government are understood to be considering the suggestion favourably. Intervention in Palestine. 224. During the summer there was much jockeying for position between Iraq and Saudi Arabia in regard to Palestine. Every well-meant move by each to induce the Arab leaders at Jerusalem to call off the campaign of violence was regarded with some suspicion and distrust by the other. It was finally necessary for Yasin to assure King Abdul Aziz that, although Nuri had appeared to take the lead by negotiating personally at Jerusalem, the Iraqi Government were not unmindful of their obligations towards Saudi Arabia, but that they were equally anxious to act in harmony with Great Britain. When this had been made clear, no difficulty was encountered in securing agreement upon the wording of the peace formula which enabled King Abdul Aziz, King Ghazi and the Amir Abdullah successfully to appeal to the Arab leaders in Palestine. Syria. Damascus Riots. 225. The disturbances which occurred in Damascus in January, resulting in the death of some Moslems, caused much indignation in Bagdad and led to manifestations of sympathy with the victims, though all street demonstrations were forbidden by the Government. A deputation of notables visited the French Legation and gave the Minister a copy of a telegram sent to the League of Nations protesting against “ French suppression of Syrian liberty.” Tribal A ffairs. 226. In the spring, a meeting was held at Aqra by the Commission for the Settlement of Disputes between Iraqi and Syrian tribes and was attended bySyrian, French and Iraqi representatives. The following tribal questions were settled at this meeting :— (1) The determination of localities on either side of the frontier into which the tribes might cross for grazing purposes during the summer. (2) The question of the koda tax payable by these tribes. (3) The authorisation for certain tribes exiled in Syria to return to Iraq. Iraqi Interests in Syria. 227. At the request of the Iraqi Government, His Majesty’s consular officers in Syria and the Lebanon were instructed in June to discontinue the protection of Iraqi nationals and interests, responsibility for which was now assumed by the Iraqi consul-general at Beirut. Telephone Service. 228. A regular telephone service between Iraq and Syria was inaugurated on the 28th March with an exchange of greetings between the Prime Minister and the French Acting High Commissioner at Beirut. Turkey. General. 229. Relations between Turkey and Iraq remained extremely good, and although the flight of Nuri, coming so soon after his visit to Istanbul, caused regret and surprise in Turkey, the new Government lost no time in assuring Angora of their desire to perpetuate and strengthen the ties of friendship between the two countries. Middle Eastern Pact of Non-A ggcession. 230. The Turkish Government, despite their anxiety to bring about the conclusion of the Middle Eastern Pact of Non-Aggression, appreciated the impossibility of Iraq’s signing until Iran has recognised the common frontier. In September, therefore, they informed the Iranian Government that they would be willing to postpone the signature of the Non-Aggression Treaty until March 1937 on the understanding that further negotiations should take place with a view to the prior recognition of the land frontier on the conditions suggested by the Shah to Nuri in August 1935, the question of the Shatt-al-Arab being reserved for subsequent solution. Treaty Relations. 231. The validity of Chapter II (Neighbourly Relations) of the Tripartite Treaty of Angora (1926) having expired in July, the question of its renewal was raised by the Iraqi Government. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom stated that, while they did not themselves wish to renew the chapter, they had no possible objection to Iraq’s doing so. They requested, however, that the instrument of renewal should state clearly that the chapter had ceased to be effective in so far as the United Kingdom was concerned. In August the Iraqi Government suggested to the Turkish Government the desirability, pending the conclusion of a neighbourly relations treaty, of extending the validity of the chapter by means of an exchange of notes. The Turkish Government agreed on condition that either party should be entitled to denounce it after a lapse of two years from its coming once more into force; and it seems probable that renewal will take place early in 1937. Iraqi Interests in Turkey. 232. An Iraqi consulate-general at Istanbul was set up during the summer and the duty of protecting Iraqi subjects and interests (in so far as the Vilayet of Istanbul and the Province of Thrace were concerned) was handed over by His Majesty’s consul-general to his Iraqi colleague on the 28th August. Arrange ments are being made for the jurisdiction of the new consul-general to extend over all the vilayets included in the district of His Majesty’s consul-general, with the exception of that of Angora, where consular jurisdiction will be exercised by the Iraqi Legation.39 United States of America. Treaty Relations. 233. The instruments of ratification of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and Iraq were exchanged at Bagdad on the 23rd April. The treaty entered into force on the same day. The possibilities of concluding a compre- w hensive commercial treaty between Iraq and the United States, which have long been under consideration, continued to form the subject of discussion between the American Minister and the Iraqi authorities. American Schools. 234. The unfriendly attitude of the former Director-General of Education and his unfair interpretation of the Conscription Law, which grants exemption pro tempore to all students of secondary schools, led to a serious falling-off in the number of pupils at the American Jesuit College. The rector of the college has, however, started negotiations with the competent authorities of the new Govern ment, who have shown signs of adopting a more accommodating attitude. Vatican. 235. The Apostolic Delegate for Iraq, Mgr. Drapier, had for long been suspected in Iraq (though probably without good reason) of carrying on political intrigues with the minorities. His alleged friendship with some of the Christians accused of participation in the Yazidi revolt of 1935 increased the suspicion with which he was regarded and, by the beginning of the year, his position had become all but impossible. 236. In March the Iraqi representative in Rome asked the Vatican for the delegate’s recall and his replacement by someone who was not a Frenchman. In May Muzahim Pachachi reported that he had obtained an undertaking that Mgr. Drapier would shortly be recalled, and at about the same time His Grace was instructed by the Vatican to move from Mosul to Bagdad. He remained in the capital for most of the summer, under police supervision, and it was not until the end of August that he was authorised by the Pope to leave Iraq. In December Mgr. Drapier was appointed Apostolic Delegate for Indo-China, but no decision had been reached before the end of the year about his successor. 237. In October Nuri told His Majesty’s Ambassador that, as a result of the grant of independence to Syria, the objection was no longer to a French Apostolic Delegate per se, but rather to the idea of having any Papal representa tive from outside. Nuri did not see why the Vatican should not deal direct with the heads of the different churches in Iraq which are in communion with Rome, or, failing that, why one of them, e.g., the Chaldean Patriarch, should not act as Apostolic Delegate. 238. It is not yet known to what extent, if at all, the new Government share Nuri’s views, but it is believed that the whole question of Papal representation in Iraq is forming the subject of discussions between the Iraqi representative in Rome and the Vatican. Yemen. Proposed Iraqi Legation. 239. In February His Majesty’s Ambassador informed the Prime Minister that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would have no objection to the establishment of an Iraqi Legation in the Yemen. Indeed, far from being harmful to British interests, such a Legation might be of considerable value to His Majesty’s Government, for, owing to the attitude of suspicion adopted by the Imam Yahya towards non-Moslem foreigners and his refusal to enter into diplomatic relations with them, it had hitherto been a matter of some difficulty to obtain regular and correct information regarding developments in the Yemen. If, however, an Iraqi diplomatic representative were established at Sana’a, His Majesty’s Government might be able to obtain confidentially from the Iraqi Government reports on conditions in that country which would be of considerable value.40 Yemeni Visitors to Iraq. 240. The year was marked by the visits to Iraq of more than one distinguished Yemeni. Chief among these was Muhammad Zubara, Minister of the Palace at Sana’a, who made a long stay in Bagdad during the summer as the guest of the Iraqi Government. It was denied that his visit was in any way official, and it would not appear that it led to any political developments of £v\ importance, but the Iraqis were flattered by it. 241. In October a contingent of ten Yemeni students, bringing the total of those studying in this country up to thirty, arrived in the charge of Qadhi Abdullah-al-Sarhi and Saiyid Yahya-al-Nahari, who, according to popular rumour, had been charged with the task of arranging for a Yemeni consulate to be established in Bagdad. Nuri, however, informed His Majesty’s Ambassador that there was no truth in the rumours. 242. Incidentally, the frequent visits of semi-official visitors to Iraq excited the suspicions of the Saudi Arabian Legation, who fear that, by encouraging such visits, the Iraqi Government are trespassing on what they regard as Ibn Saud’s preserves. Proposed Adherence to Treaty. 243. In December King Ghazi addressed to the Imam Yahya a letter enquiring whether the latter would be willing to receive a delegation to discuss the question of the adherence of the Yemen to the Treaty of Alliance between Iraq and Saudi Arabia.42 IV. —^Commercial. General. 245. The progressive expansion of Iraq’s foreign trade was well maintained ^ in 1936. As regards the financial year 1935-36, imports showed an increase of I.D. 1,135,000 over 1934-35; exports on the other hand (excluding oil) were lower by I.D. 447,000—the result of a very poor harvest in 1935. This retrogression has been amply made good in 1936, a year of exceptionally heavy crops. Iraq has been lucky in that a bumper harvest has coincided with rising world prices for grains. By the end of October, movements of barley and wheat by river and rail were so heavy that considerable congestion arose and there was some hesitation amongst local grain dealers. Congestion still exists, but the trend of prices has entirely reassured the market which is again active. The following quantities and values of wheat and barley were exported between the 1st January and the 31st October, 1936 :— Quantity in metric tons. Value in I.D. Barley 193,941 565.992 Wheat 22,924 117,106 The export of dates has been satisfactory, the total value exported up to the end of October being I.D. 664,000—a figure considerably higher than the corresponding one in 1935. Shipments of wt&gt;o1 at I.D. 383,000 and of cotton at I.D. 34,000 are substantially higher than in the preceding year when the figures at the same date were I.D. 231,000 and 16,000 respectively. 246. The following tables illustrate the import and export trade of Iraq for the first ten months of 1935 and 1936 :— 1935. 1936. (Exclusive of bullion and the export of oil.) I.D. I.D. Total imports ... 5,646,000 5,873,000 Total exports ... 2,272,000 2,568,000 The figures relating to the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Japan and Germany are :— Jan. 1 to Oct. 31, 1935. Jan 1 to Oct. 31, 1936. Imports from— ID. I.D. United Kingdom 1 646,886 1,882,483 J apan 1,131,216 1,107,797 Germany 305,595 389,714 United States of America 362,549 372,688 Exports to— United Kingdom 448,983 748,698 Japan 4,020 99,760 Germany 44,705 86,532 United States of America 466,954 575,251 These figures show small but satisfactory increases in 1936 as compared with 1935; the noteworthy increase in exports to Japan is discussed in a later paragraph. The percentage share of the United Kingdom in the total trade of Iraq rose during these two periods from 29 per cent, to 32 per cent. German Trade. 247. German competition continued to make itself felt throughout the year. Having registered an increase of I.D. 80,000 in the financial year 1935-36 with a43 fc^ total of I.D. 389,000, German imports for the first ten months of 1936 amounted to I.D. 389,714, which presages a further increase of about 15 per cent, over the full twelve months. Transactions for which Haavara assistance was given in Iraq for the financial year 1935-36 totalled some I.D. 85,000; after April 1936, on instructions from the German Government, the German Legation in Bagdad ^ exercised a close control over such transactions, which diminished for a time. Substantial importations of German cement have, however, been facilitated by this means and, in December, an important order for woollen spinning machinery was placed on the basis of Haavara exchange. An attempt to promote barter transactions between the Health Department and a Hamburg firm was frustrated by the change of Government in November, when the arrangements made under the Yasin Cabinet were cancelled. A German propaganda film was shown by the Bayer agent in the summer and the collaboration of the Ministry of Education was obtained to induce doctors, medical students and school children to attend. An Egyptian engineer, reputed to be of German training, and a German engineer named Winter have been engaged by the Public Works Department during the year. An agency for dealing in ‘ c Aski ” marks has also been opened, and various German experts—town planners, architects and engineers—have been assiduous in placing their advice (frequently without payment) at the disposal of the Iraqi Government. The increase in their share of Iraqi trade has been won in the open market, in keen competition with a variety of competitors, amongst which the Poles, Czechs and Japanese have probably suffered more than the British. Japanese Trade. 248. Imports into Iraq from Japan in the financial year 1935-36 showed an increase of some I.D. 200,000 over the previous year, but the rate of increase diminished considerably. In the first ten months of 1936 Japanese imports were lower by I.D. 23,419 than in the same period in 1935. It seems justifiable to assume that a further rapid advance by Japanese trade in this market is unlikely. 249. In May 1936 a customs regulation was put into force whereby the importation of Japanese artificial silk and cotton piece-goods was made dependent upon the exportation to Japan of Iraqi produce—other than oil—to the extent of 15 per cent, of the value of the piece-goods imported. The intention of this regulation was to oblige Japan to purchase a larger quantity of Iraqi goods. In this it has succeeded (Iraqi exports to Japan in the first ten months of this year amounted to I.D. 99,760 as against I.D. 4,020 last year). Some hopes were raised in the United Kingdom that this regulation would cause a rise in the price of Japanese piece-goods and so enable United Kingdom manufacturers to compete again in this market. There was a rise of between 5 per cent, and 15 per cent, in the price of various Japanese piece-goods, but this was insufficient to bridge the wide gap between United Kingdom and Japanese prices. A further result of the regulation wms that the desire of importers to obtain certificates of exports to J apan led to these being sold at a premium, so that cotton and grain exported to Japan commanded a higher price than it did on the world market. 250. In August 1936 a group of Bagdad merchants, amongst whom were prominent G. G. Abdeni and Co., in conjunction with Mitsubishi Kaisha (Ltd.), suggested that they be granted the monopoly of Japanese piece-goods imports. The scheme was strongly opposed by the Bagdad Chamber of Commerce and it is doubtful if it could have been carried through. The fall of the Yasin Cabinet, however, sealed its fate. Messrs. Abdeni lost the backing of their chief supporters in the Government—Rashid Ali and Yasin—while their chief opponent, Jafar- abu-Timman, became Minister of Finance. 251. There was little change in the nature of Japanese trade with Iraq. The great bulk of their business is done in artificial silk and cotton textiles and the rest in a variety of small items; amongst the more important of the latter is cement, and it was probably the German inroads upon that market which were responsible for the slight fall in Japanese imports in the first ten months of 1936. United Kingdom Trade. 252. As already shown, the United Kingdom improved its share of imports into Iraq in 1936 by I.D. 235,597 over the comparable ten monthly periods in 1935.44 Nevertheless, United Kingdom imports of cotton piece-goods still further diminished considerably (to a monthly average of I.D. 4,600 against I.D. 7,000 in 1935), while a slight decrease is indicated also in woollen piece-goods, where a monthly average of I.D. 7,700 compares with the previous year’s average of I.D. 8,400. The total values of imports in these categories, it may be noted, show a tendency to decline. Imports of machinery, iron and steel, cement and clothing from the United Kingdom were well maintained or improved, as compared with previous years. It is none the less well to remember that a substantial fraction of United Kingdom imports into Iraq are destined for use on contracts. In the period under review some £160,000 worth of materials were imported by the Royal Air Force contractors for use at Dhibban, and over £100,000 worth of steel, machinery and cement by Messrs. Balfour and Beatty, the contractors for the Kut Barrage. The importance of Government contracts to United Kingdom trade in this country is very considerable. It is gratifying, therefore, to record that the contract for the construction of two steel bridges over the Tigris at Bagdad was placed in November with Messrs. Holloway Brothers, as this scheme had been promoted by the Yasin Government, and there was a moment of doubt as to whether final signature would be given to the contract. When it was made clear to the new Government that orders to start the work had, in fact, already been given, they raised no further objection to signing the contract. Substantial orders were also placed by the Iraqi Government in the United Kingdom in 1936 for military equipment, including an order for four river gunboats. 253. The new Cabinet reached a decision in November to complete the rail way system of the country by linking Bagdad via Baiji to Mosul and Tel Kotchek to Mosul. The cost of this scheme, together with the proposed military develop ment, being too great to be met from ordinary revenue or even from the oil royalties, which are already earmarked for capital works of various sorts, the question of raising the necessary funds accordingly arose. Two proposals were put forward—one that the Iraq Petroleum Company should defer the recovery from the Iraqi Government of the dead-rent refunds which it is now due to receive, the other that a loan should be floated in London. The Minister of Finance, who is unfamiliar with the conception of a loan, was opposed to the second proposal, but by the end of the year it appeared possible that, by calling the loan an issue of bonds, his objections might be overcome. What was still unclear was the attitude of the City to the proposal. Both the French and the Germans have not been backward with various tempting offers to supply credit for the purchase of railway materials. Colonel Ward, Director of Railways, was authorised late in December by the Prime Minister to place very considerable orders for rails in the United Kingdom on the assumption that satisfactory arrangements for financing them would be made in the United Kingdom. V.—Communications. Roads and Railways. 254. Throughout the year there was an outcry from Mosul for rail com munication with Bagdad. The Yasin Government were considering whether the connexion should be made by the old German broad gauge via Baiji or by the narrow gauge via Kirkuk when the military revolt broke out. Hikmat Sulaiman realised that something must be done quickly and, encouraged by the arguments of Colonel Ward in favour of the Baiji routed formally inaugurated this extension by laying the first rail on the 29th November. 255. The problem of connecting Mosul with the railhead at Tel Kotchek was under discussion at the end of 1936, and earnest consideration was being given by the Government to the question of financing the programme of railway development over the next two years. 256. Colonel Ward had secured favourable quotations for sleepers and steel products from the United Kingdom in July, and as the year drew to a close submitted the Government to continuous pressure to close with these offers in view of the rising prices in world markets. He was successful very early in 1937, when the Government ordered in the United Kingdom £500,000 of railway material.45 Trans-Desert Routes. 257. In January His Majesty’s Embassy received from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs a note stating that the Iraqi Government had decided to recognise officially the Najaf-Medina route as the only authorised pilgrims’ way through Iraq to the Hejaz. The note added that the necessary measures had been taken to prevent pilgrims from proceeding by any other overland route. The prohibition, which, in fact, extends to the use of such all-land routes as that from Basra to Riyadh via Koweit, was not intended to apply to routes officially recognised (e.g., those via Syria, Palestine and the Suez Canal). 258. A certain amount of work was carried out on the Iraqi portion of the Najaf—Medina road, and adequate measures continued to be taken to ensure the safety of pilgrims, each convoy of cars being accompanied by an armed escort and an expert guide. Steps were also taken by the Iraqi authorities to safeguard the health of the pilgrims and to prevent the spread of disease through their agency. Civil Aviation. General. 259. Civil aviation continued to remain under the Ministry of Defence. This is unfortunate from many points of view. 260. In October Misr-Airwork opened a new air line from Bagdad to Cairo, and Air France reopened their old line between Damascus and Bagdad. The Luft Hansa Company projects an air line through Bagdad to China and Japan for fast mails. 261. An Aero Club has been formed with the Director of the Iraqi Air Force, A1 Muqaddam Muhammad-ali-Jawad, as president. The object of this club is to encourage the young people of Iraq to become air-minded. 262. Up to the time of the coup cTEtat, proposals put up by Mr. Nairn for a civil air service were under examination. They were not well regarded by experts, and after the military revolt nothing more was heard of them. 263. In the summer the Iranian Government appeared anxious to start a service between Bagdad and Tehran, but the Iraqi Government made it a condition of their agreement that reciprocal facilities should be granted in Iran to Iraqi aircraft. Meteorological Service. 264. The Iraqi Meteorological Service under the Ministry of Defence was inaugurated on the 1st April, 1936. Mr. R. H. Mathews acted as part-time director until the 11th November, when he was replaced by Mr. J. Durward, who had already had extensive experience of the weather of the Near East. Mr. Galloway was appointed to the new air port at Basra. 265. Owing to the small budget provision made for the current year, it has been impossible to obtain staff or equipment on anything but a very small scale. The following work has, however, been accomplished :— 266. Mosul has been taken over from the Royal Air Force Meteorological Service. All equipment has been bought and the station manned by one observer. Kirkuk has been taken over from the Royal Air Force Meteorological Service, the observations being made by the Iraq Petroleum Company and the instruments lent temporarily by the Air Ministry. The meteorological station at Rutbah is manned by an observer of the Iraqi service. At Bagdad airport, where the head quarters of the service have been established, the necessary equipment for the measurement of upper wind has been bought, and such observations are made usually once a day. Negotiations have proceeded with the oil companies regarding the establishment of stations at Haditha, Baiji and Alwand. It is also hoped that observations will be received from Iran and Saudi Arabia; such reports, together with those issued by surrounding countries, would, if received at the headquarters of the Meteorological Service in Bagdad, ensure the meteoro logical protection of Iraq almost completely. 267. Arrangements have been made for the free transmission, by land line, of weather reports from all meteorological stations in Iraq. A scheme of meteoro-46 logical reception and broadcasting which will be necessary at the air port during 1937 was submitted. At present this work is done by the Royal Air Force and the data necessary to construct synoptic charts for a small area are received by telephone from Hinaidi. 268. Every effort has been made to satisfy the demands of all air line operating companies, but shortage of staff and equipment and the consequent dependence on another service, make matters somewhat difficult. Ihe position should be much nearer normal by April 1937, when it is hoped that Bagdad will be staffed and equipped as a first class observation station. 269. Steps were taken with the secretary of the International Meteorological Organisation to secure the representation of Iraq on that body, and the director of the Royal Iraqi Air Force (Civil Aviation) has also recommended that the Director of the Meteorological Service be appointed a member of the International Commission for Aeronautical Meteorology. New Air Mail Scheme. 270 In spite of constant efforts on the part of His Majesty’s Embassy to extract from the Iraqi Government a definite reply regarding the proposal that they should participate in the Empire air mail scheme (c/. paragraph 253 ot the report for 1935), no definite answer was forthcoming by the end of the year. 271. Nuri intimated in the summer that the Iraqi Government, while not willing to reduce or abolish the present landing fees or excise duty on petrol, might be prepared to increase the subsidy which, under the new air mail scheme, will be due from the Iraqi Government. This and other suggestions designed to facilitate Iraq’s participation in the scheme were discussed by Mr. Wheatley with officials of the Air Ministry and General Post Office in London, but towards the end of the year the new Director of Civil Aviation declined to consider the Air Mail Charges. 272. Misr Air Lines concluded in December their negotiations with the Iraqi Government for the carriage of mail and freight. The following surcharges are levied on letters carried by these lines : — For Palestine and Transjordan— Postcards : 3 fils each. Letters and other articles: 5 fils per 10 grammes or fraction. For Egypt— Postcards : 3 fils each. Letters and other articles: 6 fils per 10 grammes or fraction. A combined fee of 18 fils is charged on air mail letter cards to all three countries. 273. The number of fighting units in the Command remained unchanged, except that No. 203 (F.B.) Squadron returned from reinforcement duty at Aden. In May two sections of armoured cars were sent as a reinforcement to Palestine. They returned in November. The distribution of units at their permanent stations at the end of the period under review was as follows:— Hinaidi — One bomber squadron. One bomber transport squadron. Two sections of armoured cars. Dhibban — One bomber squadron. One section of armoured cars. matter. VI.— Am and Military Matters. Royal Air Force. Strength.It 47 Shaibah — One bomber squadron. One section of armoured cars. Basra — One flying-boat squadron. Command. 274. During 1936, Air Vice-Marshal W. G. S. Mitchell, C.B., C.B.E., D.S.O., M.C., A.F.C., was the Air Officer Commanding the British Forces in Iraq. Dhibban and Mosul. 275. The construction of the new cantonment at Dhibban approaches completion and the transfer of units there began on the 19th October with the move of No. 30 Squadron, No. 1 Section of Armoured Cars, and a half company of Iraq levies from Mosul; and a company of Iraq levies from Hinaidi. The move of certain material of the Aircraft Depot, Ilinaidi, to Dhibban began in September and is still in progress. The Mosul air station was evacuated and formally handed over to the Iraqi Government on the 2nd December. The Persian Gulf and the Arabian Coast. 276. During the year the situation so far as the Royal Air Force was concerned in the Persian Gulf remained tranquil, and the attitude of the Trucial Sheikhs towards visiting aircraft continued to improve and was cordial in most cases. Some uneasiness was still felt, however, regarding the temper and behaviour of the inhabitants on the south coast between Ras-al-Hadd and Merbat, which forms part of the air route to Aden. Consequently, an expedition, assisted by one of His Majesty’s sloops of the Persian Gulf Division, was sent to establish new emergency landing grounds along that coast, and to endeavour to make friendly contact with the natives. As a result of this expedition it is considered that the air route to Aden is now complete. 277. The relations between the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy in the Persian Gulf remained excellent. The new naval station at Bahrein was built under supervision from Air Headquarters, and naval buildings are also being erected under Air Headquarters’ supervision at Khor Kuwai. Development of the Civil A ir Route. 278. Some progress was made with the development of the facilities required for the extended Imperial Airways services, which are due to begin early in 1937. The Basra civil air port was officially opened on the 20th April, and arrange ments are under way for the provision of some of the night flying beacons on the route from Cairo to Bagdad. An agreement has also been reached for a landing ground and flying-boat moorings at Kalba on the Batinah coast, and it is hoped to start work there early in January 1937. No decision has yet been received as to the site of the alighting area required in the Sharjah district. A ir Mail. 279. On the 21st February the conveyance of mail to and from Rutbah by service aircraft of Iraq and Middle East was discontinued, as a result of an agreement by which confidential mail is now carried by Imperial Airways. Inter-Command Flights. 280. In accordance with Air Ministry instructions, a flight of No. 55 Squadron carried out a cruise to Aden and back in December. On the 28th August, the Officer Commanding No. 70 Squadron proceeded to Karachi in a Valentia to discuss with a Staff Officer from Headquarters, India, details of the cruise of No. 84 Squadron and aircraft of No. 70 Squadron to Singapore, which is due to take place in January 1937. The aircraft returned to Hinaidi on the 5th September. Frequent visits to Middle East and to the Persian Gulf were carried out by flights of Nos. 55 and 84 Squadrons and by aircraft of No. 70 Squadron.48 A ir Exercises. 281. In order to study the problems of transport, supply and defence involved, an advanced air station was established from the 20th to 23rd April near Hinaidi. No. 55 Squadron, one flight of No. 30 Squadron, two sections of armoured cars and one company of Iraq levies took part. Members of the Iraqi army and air force were present as spectators. Arrangements had been made whereby two squadrons of the Royal Air Force were to take part in the Iraqi army manoeuvres early in November. Owing to the political disturbances at the end of October, however, these manoeuvres were cancelled. Surveys. 282. Considerable survey work was carried out in an area north of Rutbah extending westwards from Haditha to the Syrian border. A survey party was also sent early in December to complete the data required for the compilation of an up-to-date map of the Bahrein Islands. Air Liaison Officers. 283. It has been proposed that the present intelligence recording officer, Basra, be replaced by an air liaison officer with headquarters at Bahrein, who would work closely with the political authorities in the Persin Gulf and keep the Air Commanding Officer more closely in touch with matters affecting the Royal Air Force in the Persian Gulf. This proposal has been accepted in principle, and it is hoped that the post Avill be filled shortly. An air liaison officer remains at Mosul now that the Royal Air Force station has been abandoned. Iraq Levies. Organisation and Establishment. 284. The present strength and location of the Iraq levies is :— Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 (Assyrian) Companies at Hinaidi. No. 5 (Arab) Company at Dhibban. No. 6 (Arab) Company at Shaibah. No. 7 (Arab) Company at Makinah. No. 8 (Kurdish) Company at Dhibban. No. 5 (Assyrian) Company was disbanded during the summer owing to emigra tion to Syria and reformed as an Arab Company at Makinah, whence it moved to Hinaidi and latter to Dhibban. No. 8 (Kurdish) Company moved to Dhibban from Mosul during November and December. Training. 285. Normal training has been continuous during the year, and anti-gas training has been added to the syllabus of work. The progress of the training of the new Arab company has been satisfactory, but it hs not yet reached the standard of the other companies. Iraqi A rmy. General. 286. The military coup d’Etat had considerable effect on the expansion policy of the army. It was well known in the past that the new Chief of the General Staff, A1 Fariq Bekr Sidqi-al-Askari, did not see eye to eye with A1 Amid Taha-al-Hashimi, his predecessor. Within a few days of the 29th October, the new Chief of the General Staff published his views on the unfitness of units for war and the marked shortage of officers. He stated that he intended to consolidate the two existing divisions and to raise a third division later. He wished to go ahead with the raising of a mobile force, which was the policy of his predecessor, and to expand the Royal Iraqi Air Force by three squadrons. 287. To implement this policy, he made plans to increase the output of the Royal Iraqi Military College. He offered 140 cadetships for the army and eighty for the air force to secondary school boys between the ages of 17 and49 24. The courses in instruction are to be shortened to one year. He further proposed to spend about £1,750,000 on new armament. 288. Before the coup d’Etat the army had been given little chance to settle down to the serious business of training for war. The raising of new units and the consequent dislocation in parent units, the undertaking of operations against the Muntafiq in February, and the prolonged punitive action against the tribes on the Middle Euphrates from April to August, postponed the much needed period of respite required to consolidate the army, which consisted largely of poorly trained conscripts. In August the troubles subsided, and the army was looking forward to enjoying an energetic collective training season. The then Chief of the General Staff, A1 Amid Taha-al-Hashimi, seized the opportunity to pay his long postponed visit to the United Kingdom, and plans were made to hold army manoeuvres on a large scale in November. 289. The strategical policy throughout the year has not changed, and pro gress has been made with the plans to meet external aggression. 290. The new Chief of the General Staff expressed his views on the Iranian menace most forcibly, and it is likely that considerable attention will be focussed in the future on this portion of the frontier. National Service. 291. The National Service Law came into effect on the 1st January, 1936, and a total of about 11,000 conscripts have passed through depots and units during the year. These comprised some 5,000 of the 1917 class and about 3,000 of the 1914-15 classes (the latter being trained as reservists), and about 3,000 of the 1916 class. A considerable number of these were found to be unfit for general service, and were only given short periods of training, some being eventually formed into labour companies. 292. Most of the settled districts of Iraq have provided their quota, and all classes of the population have been affected, including Jews and Yazidis. 293. A number of the conscripts appeared to be under age, those sent in by the northern districts being on the whole distinctly poor in physique, while the numbers were much below estimates. Efforts have also been made to increase applications for voluntary enlistment, but these have met with little response. Schemes have also been introduced whereby volunteers may enlist in the army for long service, and conscripts who have completed their colour service may re-engage. These schemes are designed to ensure that a small percentage of all ranks will be on a long service basis. A noticeable feature in the towns has been the institution of a Youth Movement. Secondary and intermediate school boys receive an elementary military training in uniform for a few hours weekly under army non-commissioned officers. The numbers under training throughout the country total about 2,000. The training of conscripts has been carried out in training depots and units in out-stations. The period of training has been about thirteen weeks for all classes. 294. The training depot at Amarah was closed down in November. Budget. 295. The budget and allotment for the army and air force in 1936-37 amounted to I.D. 1,190,820. In addition, certain moneys were allotted to the Ministry under the Three-Year Works Scheme. Amongst these items are :— I.D. (a) Construction of a hangar at Bagdad air port ... 12,500 (5) River fleet ... ... ... ... ••• ••• 60,000 In addition to the above, an allotment of I.D. 1,405,900 was made for military buildings and equipment under the Five-Year Capital Development Works Scheme. Strength. 296. The strength of the army and air force at the end of the year was 21,887 with an establishment of 24,162. The figures show a deficiency in officers of about 180.mm 50 297. During the year the following new units were raised One cavalry regiment. Battalion headquarters and one engineer company. One 6-in. howitzer section. One field battery. iTV. One mountain battery. One signal battalion. Five infantry battalions. One M.T. company. One cavalry transport section. Two infantry transport sections. Organisation. 298. New Defence Regulations were published in September which elaborated the relations between the Ministry and the members of the Defence Council. Efforts were made in this regulation to decentralise control to Divisional Commanders by giving the Chief of the General Staff power to authonse these officers to carry out certain duties on his behalf. In December a new Defence Regulation was published which cancelled all previous orders on the subject. Bv this regulation, the Defence Council was abolished and all authority was centralised in the Minister and the Chief of the General Staff. The Chief of the General Staff, however, still retains the power to authorise commanders of divisions to carry out certain duties on his behalf. 299. On the 1st April the army was reorganised on the basis of two divisions and army troops, 1st Divisional Headquarters being in Bagdad, and the Divisional Headquarters at Kirkuk. Seven infantry brigades were formed, each consisting of three infantry battalions. Battalions were renumbered by brigades in accordance with modern Turkish army organisation. One fiold artillery brigade and one mountain artillery brigade were allotted to each division. Divisional and brigade staffs are still on a skeleton basis owing to the shortage of officers. Operations. 300. The year opened with signs of unrest in February in the Muntafiq area, owing to disputes over land settlement and conscription. The prompt concentration of a military force at Nasiriyah, combined with punitive action by the police and demonstrations by the air force, induced the tribes to submit to the Government by the end of the month. 301. Severe tribal disturbances broke out on the Euphrates towards the end of April amongst the Duwalim, Beni Akhra and A1 Ajib tribes, in the vicinity of Rumaithah. A force consisting of two flights of the Iraqi Air Force, an armoured train, one cavalry regiment, one field and two mountain batteries, nine infantry battalions, and one motor machine-gun company was formed under A1 Fariq Bekr Sidqi and concentrated at Rumaithah. The operations took the form of three punitive columns operating within the disaffected area, and it was not until the middle of May that the situation was eased. Considerable losses were incurred by the tribesmen, and the army casualties amounted to about ninety killed and wounded. A noticeable feature of the operations was the bringing down by tribal rifle fire of two military aircraft, probably owing to low flying during bombing attacks. The trouble spread to the Diwaniyah area in May, but after a slight resistance the insurgents were dispersed. 302. Increased garrisons were retained in the Middle Euphrates area throughout the summer, but in spite of these precautions, minor unrest was reported from Khidr in August. Decisive air action and a strong military demonstration, however, sufficed to quell the outbreak. 303. By the end of the year the trouble had subsided sufficiently to enable the bulk of the augmented garrisons to be sent to their peace stations for the commencement of the collective training season and participation in manoeuvres. Police forces were, however, increased, and a small mixed force was retained at Khidr until the change of Government after the coup d’Etat, when these units returned to their peace stations.51 Training. 304. The training programme for the year was again considerably curtailed owing to the operations mentioned above. It was not until August and September, when units returned to their peace stations, that any efforts were made to complete individual training, which was badly needed by the insufficiently trained conscripts. By the end of September all units were preparing for their move to the annual collective training camps. The 1st Division was concentrated at Table Mountain and the 2nd Division at Qara Tappah. A cavalry brigade train ing camp and an artillery practice camp for the artillery of the 1st and 2nd Divisions were held at Qaraghan during October. Battalion and brigade training were completed, but just prior to the move to the concentration area for army manoeuvres, the programme was interrupted by the couf cTfitat of the 29th October. All collective training ceased at once, units returning to their peace stations early in November. 305. There has been little, if any, advance from the standard of former years in tactical training. Staff work is still mediocre and little control of operations on manoeuvres was exercised. Command is still centralised, and subordinate officers show little initiative. The general standard of individual training has decreased considerably with the influx of conscripts under the National Service Law. 306. Courses have taken place throughout the year at the various instructional establishments. The small arms school was closed down in December in accordance with the plans of expansion for the Iraqi Royal Military College for 1937. 307. The number of officers and non-commissioned officers on courses in England and India has been maintained. Excellent reports have been received on all these. A noticeable addition is the presence of two officers at the Tank Corps Central School in England. The study of English is still popular, and is a much desired qualification in order to proceed on courses abroad. Armament and Equipment. 308. Signals. —Eight mobile wireless stations and two high-power wireless stations have been received during the year and taken into use. 309. Mechanical Transport. —The two divisional mechanical transport companies are still on a cadre basis. The more important purchases made during the year were :— 35 4-wheeled, military 30-cwt. chassis (G.S. bodies and chassis for technical bodies). (The above are Ford and Chevrolet products, American origin.) 8 Crossley 6-wheeled chassis for armoured cars. 14 ambulance bodies, complete, for mounting on Ford and Chevrolet 4-wheeled chassis, purchased locally. * 2 sets mobile repair outfits, each comprising :— 1 mobile workshop lorry and 1 power trailer ~j 1 mobile store lorry &gt; Chassis—Ford 4-wheeled. 1 mobile breakdown lorry J 7 water-tank trailers, 100 gallons capacity. 4 wireless cars—Austin 10 h.p. 6 motor cycles, B.S.A. 15 Scammell 10-wheeled, 12-ton capacity, purchased second-hand from the Iraq Petroleum Company (3 tankers and 12 load-carrying). Four of these will be used, without trailing bogies, as tractors for guns of 6-in. howitzer battery. Ordnance. 310. Sixty-four Vickers-Berthier light automatic machine guns were received and issued to the three cavalry regiments and the motor machine-gun company. The frontier battalions have retained their Hotchkiss guns, which will eventually be replaced by Bren machine guns, of which 200 are on order from Czechoslovakia. 311. Large consignments of -303 rifles have been received throughout the year; 15,000 Mark III from British sources and 20,000 of 1914 pattern from Czechoslovakia. A portion of the latter have been issued to the police. [14956] b 14— 52 312. Eighteen million rounds of s.a.a. of poor quality were also received from Czechoslovakia. This ammunition is being broken down and the components used in the local factory. In addition, 3^ to 4 million rounds were manufactured at the Government small arms ammunition factory in Bagdad during the course of the year. Steps are being undertaken to expand this factory. One section of two 6 -inch 26-cwt. howitzers was equipped for drill and training purposes. 313. Two hundred Vickers machine guns arrived from England, but delay was experienced with the receipt of the bulk of the tripods and ammunition belts. Delivery was not complete by the end of the year. The equipment of the army throughout with leather in lieu of web was completed by September. Eleven 4-5-inch howitzers and carriages and four 3-7-inch howitzers, together with considerable quantities of artillery ammunition, arrived from the United Kingdom during December. A dministrative Services. 314. The administration of the army is still much below British standards. Centralisation is paramount, and senior officers are loath to take responsibility, much of the minor administrative detail being left to the Minister and the Chief of the General Staff. 315. Major B. H. C. Lea-Wilson, R.A.M.C., was appointed Inspector of Medical Services on a seven months’ contract in May. This officer made extensive visits to all military medical establishments and compiled a full report on the medical deficiencies in the army. It is hoped that his recommendations will be acted upon. 316. The new Military Works Directorate has shown its worth in the considerable building activities which have been going on in the army throughout the year, although a certain slowing-up became necessary in June owing to expenditure in excess of financial provision. The more important construction work has been the new barracks at Kirkuk, Rowanduz, Diwaniyah, Musaiyib, Amarah, Nasiriyah and Qaraghan, and the construction of a new Ministry of Defence in the citadel at Bagdad. Considerable increases have been made to existing lines in Mosul, Bagdad and Basra. 317. There has been considerable expansion in the Mechanical Transport Directorate. A second divisional mechanical transport company was raised in Kirkuk. The base mechanical transport workshop has been extended. A large increase in mechanical transport is foreshadowed. The peace establishments of divisional second-line mechanical transport may be increased from 45 to 150 load-carrying lorries in each division. Many technical vehicles and transport for other arms will be included in the expansion programme. There is a general shortage of trained Iraqi officers for mechanical transport services. No supple mentary reserve exists at present. The driving school is well run, but no artificers school exists. Repair work is almost entirely carried out by civilian personnel. The mechanical transport service generally requires extensive reorganisation to meet future requirements, both peace and war. 318. Ordnance activities are on the increase. Musaiyib has been chosen as the location for a new rifle factory. Construction has not yet begun, but the necessary equipment for the factory is on order from England. The enlargement of the repair workshops in Bagdad is still in progress. Royal Iraqi Air Force. General. 319. The progress of the Royal Iraqi Air Force during 1936 has been marked. Discipline is much better and serious training has begun. The many operations have given officers and men alike considerable experience. Their equipment has given excellent service and has been remarkably well maintained under the direction of the seconded Royal Air Force non-commissioned officers. The overhaul and repair programme of all types of engines and airframes was well followed until the end of the year, the standard of serviceability being high. The present weakness of the Iraqi air force is not in leadership or discipline or equipment, but in administration.53 Operations. 320. During 1936 the Iraqi Air Force was used several times on active operations, and once to support the coup d'Etat. 321. In February six “ Hawker ” aircraft were based at Nasiriyah to support the military and police forces against the Beni Rikab. These aircraft dropped warning leaflets on the tribesmen on the 29th February. This action, combined with a police offensive, induced the recalcitrant tribesmen to submit. 322. In April twelve aircraft (“ Hawkers ” and “ Dragons ”) were based on Diwaniyah to support a force of two brigades against the Dhuwalim and other tribes. Intensive bombing operations followed during the next few days and until the 15th May, as many as three raids a day being made. The aircraft finally returned to Bagdad on the 16th June. Two aircraft were shot down, the crews being killed. Several other aircraft were hit, but the morale of the air force remained high. In August and October bombing operations were again necessary at Khidr and near Samawah. A ir Co-operation with the A rmy. 323. Army/air co-operation throughout the year, apart from work done during active operations, was spasmodic. Few of the senior officers of the Iraqi army yet understand the usefulness of aircraft to their units, with the result that little, if any, serious army/air co-operation was attempted. Two officers of the Iraqi Air Force completed the Army Co-operation Course at Old Sarum in August, but they returned to find that they could not obtain army liaison officers to help them. One army liaison officer was obtained for the Iraqi Air Force after much persuasion. He was a staff officer who had recently completed the two years’ Staff School Course, and was acknowledged to be capable. During the important operations of May, however, he was left behind at Hinaidi. Special air demonstrations at Hinaidi were arranged by the Iraqi Air Force for the Staff School and the Senior Officers’ Course. The flying programme included message picking up, message dropping, W/T communication, aircraft at known heights, and reconnaissance of troops (infantry, cavalry and cars) in the open and under different types of cover. Expansion. 324. The expansion programme of the Iraqi Air Force originally included, for 1937, the provision of three new squadrons (a modern fighter squadron, a modern bomber squadron, and a light general purpose squadron). Eighty cadets and 200 apprentices were to have been put under training early in 1937. This programme has, however, already been modified for various reasons. It is unlikely that the necessary aircraft will arrive until 1938; and it is certain that there will not be enough trained airmen to man the new squadrons until the middle or end of 1938. The modified plan still includes the provision of the new squadrons as soon as possible, but accepts the unavoidable delay. Thirty more cadets only are to be trained during 1937. With the fifteen now nearing the end of their training, this means about forty more pilots to be added in 1937 to the existing thirty-seven. 325. Ten more de Havilland “Tiger Moths” have already been ordered for immediate delivery, and 100 more apprentices are to be recruited for the Apprentices’ Wing at Hinaidi. This will mean that 192 will be under training. A further 100 are to be accepted next September. 326. The general strength of the Iraqi Air Force was raised by one service squadron during 1936, and now consists of :— No. 1 Squadron (Hawker-Nisr): (General Purpose). No. 2 Squadron (de Havilland Dragon and Puss Moths). No. 3 Squadron (Hawker-Nisr): (General Purpose). Flying Training School. Apprentices’ Wing. Aircraft Depot. Specialist Sections (Armament, W/T and Photography). Stores. Headquarters.54 327. As regards new aircraft, the Director of the Iraqi Air Force has in mind “ Hawker ” monoplane bombers and fighters. He proposes to order a year’s supply of spare parts, 25 per cent, reserve of aircraft, and all the necessary ancillary gear, such as guns, parachutes, bomb sights, &amp;c. Training. 328. The technical training of the apprentices resulted in ninety-five being passed into units during December. Ninety-two new apprentices were accepted. The Apprentices’ Wing has been remodelled on the Royal Air Force School at Halton, and has considerably improved in consequence. 329. The flying training school passed out twelve pilots during the year, and is already far advanced with a further sixteen (all of whom have already completed over twenty hours ^solo flying). The standard remains high. Three Iraqi officers have now passed the Instructors’ Course at the Central Flying School in England, and contributed to this year’s flying instructional programme. 330. The standard of flying remains comparatively high, with no serious crashes in spite of a considerable increase in flying and in the number of new pilots taking part. 331. Low bombing training in the Iraqi Air Force has, until recently, always been accorded pride of place in individual training, largely because of its usefulness on the frequent operations of the past years. But the inspector recommended that low bombing should be abandoned in favour of precision bombing (using sights) from 5,000 feet. This advice was not taken and two aircraft were shot down over the Euphrates. Since that time, however, precision bombing has been taken seriously. 332. Little instrument and direction-finding flying was attempted, but all the pilots of the Iraqi Air Force are practised in formation flying. Courses. 333. The following courses in England were successfully completed by Iraqi Officers in 1936 : — Instructors (Central Flying School) ... ... ... 2 Army Co-operation (Old Sarum) 2 Royal Air Force Officers’ Engineering (Halton) ... ... 1 Armament (Eastchurch) l Air Navigation (Manston) ... ... ... ... ... 1 In every case the standard obtained was satisfactory, some of the officers doing remarkably well. 334. Vacancies in fourteen Royal Air Force Courses in England have been requested for 1937-38.

CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No. 3 l (14888) IRAQ. Annual Report, 1935. [E 851/851/93] Sir A. Clark Kerr to Mr. Eden.—[Received February 17.) (No. 56. Confidential.) Sir, Bagdad, January 31, 1936. I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith the annual report on Iraq for the year 1935. The chapters on foreign relations and the general editing of the report are the work of Mr. Gorell Barnes, while the chapters on internal affairs and on trade, commerce and internal economic affairs have been written respectively by Captain Holt and Mr. Summerscale. 2. The name of Yassin Pasha-al-Hashimi is one which, in the past, has awakened misgivings in the minds of some of my predecessors in Bagdad. An atrabiliar man, stiffnecked, suspicious and xenophobe. A narrow and all too tenacious Moslem, holding in hatred ourselves and, above all, the 1930 treaty. A clever and an uncomfortable enemy. All this, and more, has been believed of Yassin, and, indeed, a glance at his antecedents lends full colour to the belief. But of late a metamorphosis has taken him. It has been sudden and it seems to be complete. It has not only left him frank enough to confess, with some sadness, his old mistakes and to declare his faith in a hand-to-hand association of his country with ours; it has also brought with it something not far off confidence in the disinterestedness of the policy of His Majesty’s Government, and, with all this, a growing freedom from black bile, indeed, a geniality and mellowness of temper which move me strongly to forget his past. 3. There is no need here to pause to speculate upon the origins of this happy transmutation, which are probably a mixture of expediency and common sense, I mean an increasing awareness of the weaknesses of this country. It is enough to put it on record that we have, I think, in Iraq a new friend who was an old enemy, and from this we may draw some comfort. And if, in the present despatch, I have ventured to make mention of it, my excuse must be that in Iraq 1935 has been, from its stormy beginning to its relatively peaceful end, a Yassin year, the good and the bad of it alike. 4. It was he who, in January, inspired in the Senate the insurrection against the incompetence and corruption of the administration of Ali Jaudat, who, with a packed Parliament behind him, was engaged in enriching himself, heedless of the exacerbation of public opinion. It was Yassin again who set on foot the perilous intrigue which ended in something like a popular movement—indeed, almost a revolution—and swept away not only Ali Jaudat and a thirteen days Government under Jamil-al-Madfai, but the whole tradition in virtue of which such Cabinets had been possible in the past. 5. The situation in the country at that time was dominated by two essential and relatively new factors. First the influence of the palace had disappeared. In the days of King Faisal it had been paramount. Its withdrawal had upset the balance. There was nothing to take its place. Then the tribes, which thelate King had skilfully held aloof from ^ al J t S ^ an excursion on the one hand by Ah Jaudat, and on . suffered a radical change and into politics. Thus the whole polity of ^^“'^^ipotence in tfovern- the Iraqis were on the way to leain tra , • .. i 0 f f] ie Kins, but now meuts. Hitherto they had come and gone at the bidding ot King, ^ they were to come and go at the bidding o P P 6 .

He was d i at tnn 'to nreclaim his intention to redress grievances and to impose a .just and clu Y , , there has allowed them to twist the course ot grudges o in ^ ^ c h j Yassin has been tolerably successful, and there can be ' 1U lnbt that dffiouteTabout titles to land are being disposed of with less prejudice tLn in tt past P and S that thus one of the mam causes of tribal unrest is being removed. 1 . 8 It cannot of course, be said that there is no discontent lett, for there is tT^tnfaf^^ajt that Kurdista^providedtts annual peck of troubles, while at Qurna the first gathering h rerraUs P under the new conscription law led to disturbances which involved sLe St mdUary operations. And, again, in the Sinjar some Yazidi tribes resisted “the recruiting of conscripts and were very savagely handled. In this iSnt the military courts so abused their powers that the Government were obliged to amend the law governing the rights of courts-martial. , But 1 told that, generally speaking, amongst the tribes discontent is endemic and that no cure has yet been found for it. 9 In addition to Rashid Ali, there are other weaknesses in the Cabinet which give rise to some doubts about the future. Ja afar, the Minister of Defence a XurPman carries little weight and is unhappy in his post. The Ministers o Education and Finance depend too much upon the i rune Minister and the business of these Departments is likely to suffer from the delays which this denendence involves. There is no Minister of Justice, and this portfolio has been entrusted to Rashid Ali. The division of his time between two Ministries is damaging to the work of both Departments and gives him more power and prestige than he is fit to have. These weaknesses are not irremediable, but, it allowed to continue for long, they might well produce a corporate debility too great for the personal energy of the Prime Minister to overcome. 10. As a counterweight to Rashid Ali in the Cabinet, the presence of Nun has b«en of value and probably some of Yassin s success has been c ue to i . n the davs of the mandate, when Nuri had been our instrument to secure the agreements in virtue of which Iraq entered upon her full sovereign rights and beanie a member of the League of Nations, Yassin had fought him doggedly3 p 2 [12931] and bitterly, for Nuri, as you are well aware, sprang from the opposite camp. When, therefore, these two men decided to set the past aside and to throw in their lot together, it was the fashion to say that so unnatural a partnership must of necessity be short-lived. But it has withstood for nine months the many influences which have conspired to break it up. It is true that, from time to time, it has been somewhat strained. Indeed, on one occasion, I was called in to build a bridge across a gulf which threatened to swallow it up. Political busy- bodies had persuaded Yassin that Nuri wished to oust him and to take his place, and Nuri that Yassin wanted to be rid of him. Each one had lent an ear to this gossip and had become prickly and suspicious. I was, however, able to convince the one that there was no new evil in the other and so to bring them together again. My task, though delicate, proved to be not too difficult, for in their hearts they knew that the one could not stand without the other. I imposed it upon myself because it seemed to me that this partnership held the only promise of the stable Government which Iraq so sorely needed; and that it was in the best interest not only of this country but also of His Majesty's Government in the united Kingdom to avert a relapse into the painful strife and uncertainty which would follow a break-up. And I am glad to be able to say that on the whole the Government under Yassin enter upon the new year with unshaken prestige and enhanced authority, and are now settling down quietly to their far-reaching- programme of reform. 11 . As a result of the trouble on the Euphrates and the uncertainties of the parliamentary situation in the spring, the budget estimates were not intro duced until the end of December. The Departments were able, without difficulty, to carry out their normal work on monthly allotments, but the undetermined financial position, combined with the other preoccupations that faced them, deterred the Government from setting on foot any extensive schemes of economic and social reform. But by the end of the year there were signs that Yassin was well on the way with his plans for finance. It remains, however, to be seen whether the growing demands of an expanding army will not force him either to shelve the attractive schemes which have already been put off from year to year, or to have recourse to a foreign loan, a step which would mean a departure from the traditional financial policy of Iraq and which would probably meet with widespread opposition. 12 . I have mentioned Yassin’s change of heart. The hazard of Nuri's prolonged absences at Geneva and Tehran, when Yassin took his place at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, brought me (and Mr. Bateman, as Charge d'Affaires) into close personal contact with the Prime Minister. So soon as the last corners of the old Yassin had been rubbed off, all discussions were carried on in an atmosphere of frank and easy understanding, and throughout he showed a nice respect for the treaty and a readiness to meet us whenever that was possible, and often enough to listen to our advice. The result has been that two of the most difficult questions that have long troubled the relations between the two countries are in a fair way of settlement, and many less important matters have been disposed of. At the same time many of his actions have shown that it is Yassin’s fixed purpose so to develop the political and economic strength of the country as to enable Iraq some day to dispense with outside help. 13. In his relations with King Ghazi, Yassin has shown patience and forbearance. In moments of expansion he speaks with bitterness of His Majesty’s schoolboy frailties and lack of interest in public affairs, but it cannot be said that he has not done everything possible to promote the prestige of the throne and to shield the King from criticism. Any anxieties which His Majesty may have had in the spring, when it was said that his Prime Minister was aiming at dictator ship, must have been handsomely dismissed by Tassin’s declarations, when announcing his programme, that the Government’s first care would be to follow' the path of constitutional government.

British Empire. United Kingdom. His Majesty’s Representative in Iraq. Sir Francis Humphrys left Bagdad on the 15th March on the termination of his appointment as His Majesty’s Ambassador in Iraq. He was suc^eded by Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, who arrived m Bagdad on the 18th March, and presented his letter of credence to King Ghazi on the 23rd March. Royal Air Force. 2. Something of the friendly spirit which, since the end of 1933,* has characterised the relations between His Majesty’s Embassy and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs spread to those between the officers of the Royal Air Foi ce and the Iraqi officials with whom they are normally in contact, with the result that there was a welcome absence of friction. Many questions of detail were settled with the competent departments of the Iraqi Government direct, and the necessity for the intervention of His Majesty’s Embassy, except on important questions of5 [12931] B 3 policy, arose less often than hitherto. Considerable correspondence concerning the Koyal Air Force did, nevertheless, pass between His Majesty’s Embassy and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and it was marked by its friendly tone. 3. In September 1934 the Iraqi Government asked that a suitable site within the Hinaidi cantonment might be allotted to them for the building o military schools during the coming financial year. I he Air Ministry were a first inclined to refuse permission for such building to be begun until a, date remote enough to ensure that it would not be completed before the evacuation ot Hinaidi by the Royal Air Force. 1 hey thought that the schools, once built, would inevitably be occupied, and that their occupation would lead to administrative difficulties within the cantonment. But, in December 1935, His Majesty s Embassy were able to inform the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that the Air Officer Commanding had been authorised to hand over, on certain conditions, a site considered to be suitable by the Iraqi authorities. 1 he most important of these conditions was that the schools should not be used or occupied until the transfer of the Royal Air Force units from Hinaidi to Dhibban had for the most part been carried out, and then only after specific permission has been given by the Air Ministry. 4. In October the Ministry for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty s Embassy that the Iraqi Government were experiencing difficulty in securing buildings and hangars for the second squadron of the Royal Iraqi Air Force, the formation of which they had decided to complete by the middle of 1936. As they were bound, under the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930, to take over the Royal Air Force cantonments at Hinaidi and Mosul when those cantonments were evacuated by the Royal Air Force, they did not feel justified in incurring expenditure for the construction of new buildings and hangars for this squadron. They hoped, therefore, that it might be possible for the Iraqi Government to take over in June 1936 the Royal Air Force cantonment at Mosul, which must be evacuated within a maximum period of five years from the coming into force of the treaty, i.e., before October 1937. His Majesty’s Embassy were informed that, by June 1936, the new cantonment at Dhibban would not be in a state to receive the Royal Air Force squadron now at Mosul, but the possibility of handing over the aerodrome at that place in October next was under serious consideration at the end of the year. The Euphrates Rising. 5 . On the 8 th May, the day after the first outbreak of trouble at Rumaitha (see paragraphs 299 and 300), a reconnaissance flight of Royal Air Force machines passed over the disturbed area. One aeroplane was shot down by the tribesmen in the belief that it was an Iraqi machine. The pilot and his observer were both killed and the machine was destroyed. The bodies were decently treated by the tribesmen and handed over to a representative of the Royal Air Force for burial. 6 . Twice during these operations the Prime Minister asked for the help of the Royal Air Force. On the first occasion he asked for a machine to take supplies of ammunition to the police at Nasariyah, and on the second for a demonstration flight of Royal Air Force machines, which he hoped would create a valuable moral effect upon the Nasariyah and Shatrah sheikhs, with whom the Minister of Defence was conducting parleys at Nasariyah. In both instances Sir A. Clark Kerr, on instructions, explained to the Prime Minister that His Majesty’s Government could not sanction the use of British forces for the suppression of internal disturbances in Iraq. 7. British officials in the service of the Iraqi Government were, however, able to render valuable assistance. Mr. Ditchburn, an Administrative Inspector employed in the Ministry of the Interior, took an active part in the negotiations with the sheikhs in the disaffected area; while the armed ships which operated successfully in and about the Hammar Lake, were fitted out by Colonel Ward, the director of the Port of Basra. Their engines and crews were in the charge of British officers from the port, who volunteered to accompany them. Aerodrome Guards. 8 . In a private letter dated the 12th March, Sir Francis Humphrys informed Nuri Pasha that His Majesty’s Government regarded the secret letter written by him as Iraqi Prime Minister on the 30th June, 1930, as binding on the Iraqi6 Government, and that they could not therefore accept the statement to the contrary made in Dr. Abdullah Beg Damluji’s note of the 25th June, 1934. Nun 1 ash* did not reply to this communication, and the measures necessary for the formation of the Air Defence Force were not further discussed with the Iraqi Government. 9. Meanwhile, in anticipation of the departure of the Assyrians to byna, the Air Officer Commanding proposes gradually to recruit Arabs and Kurds to take the place of the Assyrians now serving in the levies. Fifty Arabs from the Amara district were recruited in December 1935. The Iraqi (government raised no objection. Military Mission. 10. The Staff Officer to the Inspector-General of the Iraqi army left Iraq on the termination of his contract in May, and was not replaced This was according to plan. Otherwise, the personnel of the mission lemained unchanged. They continued to maintain good relations with the Iraqi General Staff, who showed an increasing desire to seek and to follow their advice on matters affecting the training of the Iraqi army. But during the suppression of the Yazidi revolt they were given clearly to understand that they were not expected to interfere. Supply to Iraq of A rms and A mmunition in times of Urgent Need. 11 . The Iraqi Government decided not to avail themselves of the conditional offer of the War Office to furnish from British stocks ammunition required by the Iraqi army in cases of urgent need, but, instead, to purchase the necessai^ quantities and hold them in reserve in Iraq. On the other hand, they were grateful for the help which the Royal Air Force were willing to afford in respect of bombs, &amp;c., and small arms ammunition; and during the Euphrates rising in May they were actually supplied with 600 rifles and 400,000 rounds of ammunition at short notice from Royal Air Force stocks in Iraq. British Officials. 12. Ten British officials left Iraq on the expiry of their contracts in May 1935. Some of them were offered new contracts, but refused, whilst others the Iraqi Government did not wish to retain. Among those who left were Sir Kinahan Cornwallis, adviser to the Ministry of the Interior, Colonel Prescott, inspector-general of police, and Mr. Sievwright, inspector-general of customs. Colonel Prescott was not replaced; but Mr. Edmonds, formerly assistant adviser to the Ministry of the Interior and acting adviser to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, succeeded Sir Kinahan Cornwallis, whilst Mr. Sievwright’s place was taken by Mr. Swan, formerly assistant adviser to the Ministry of Finance. 13. Whilst dispensing, however, with the services of certain older British officials, whose high salaries and connexion with the mandatory regime were unpopular, the Iraqi Government did not hesitate to recruit new men from the United Kingdom to fill posts, where technical experience was required. In December 1935 there were actually seventy-six British officials (excluding railway and port officers) in the employment of the Iraqi Government, one more than in December 1934. The number of British officials employed by the Port of Basra increased during the year from thirty-two to fifty-four, largely owing to the arrival of a new dredger. The number of railway officials was reduced by one to twenty-eight. 14. British officials recruited during 1935 included a legal adviser for the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and an expert in technical education. No foreign officials other than British were recruited. Purchase of Stores in the United Kingdom. 15. Early in 1936 definite arrangements were made for orders for military stores required by the Iraqi Government from the United Kingdom to be placed direct with the War Office and Air Ministry. His Majesty’s Embassy under stand, however, that in certain cases the Ministry of Defence have found it necessary to purchase stores for the Royal Iraqi Air Force direct from the manufacturers. 16. For a period of one year from the 15th March, 1935, the Iraqi Govern ment agreed that the Crown Agents for the Colonies should, on certain conditions and at certain stipulated rates of remuneration, continue to act as their agents[12931] b 4 7 CZO for the purchase and inspection of stores in the United Kingdom. One of the conditions on which the Crown Agents originally offered to continue to undertake this work for the Iraqi Government was that all non-military stores purchased by them from United Kingdom firms should be purchased through the Crown Agents. The Iraqi Government never accepted this condition word for word, and during the course of the summer they stated that they regarded as excluded from their arrangement with the Crown Agents non-military stores purchased through Iraqi agents of United Kingdom firms. On the 5th December the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs were informed in a note from His Majesty’s Embassy that the Crown Agents were unable to accept this contention, but that they were prepared to enter into a fresh agreement for one year to transact business for the Iraqi Government, with the same rates of remuneration as before, provided that there was a clear understanding that the following conditions should be observed :—- ( 1 ) That all supplies of permanent way material and rolling-stock, rivei craft, dredgers and other ships of British manufacture placed in the United Kingdom, and all stores to their patterns and specifications were ordered exclusively through them. (2) That they should not in any circumstances be placed in competition with the Manchester office of the Iraq Railways. (3) That the prices obtained by them must be treated as confidential and not divulged to any third party. Future of the Iraq Railways. 17. The period for the establishment of an Iraqi Railway Corporation in accordance with clause 4 of the financial agreement attached to the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930 was again extended by mutual agreement between the two Govern ments for a period of one year from October 1935. 18. Meanwhile it had become increasingly clear that the Iraqi Government were unwilling to take the necessary steps to give effect to the relevant provisions of the financial agreement and would continue indefinitely to profess their inability to do so; and that the only hope of reaching a definite settlement regarding the future of the railways was to open negotiations with the Iraqi Government on a new basis. In August, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires was accordingly authorised to inform the Iraqi Government that His Majesty’s Government, though unable to accept the Iraqi Government’s contention that the arrangements provided for in the financial agreement were unpractical, were, nevertheless, prepared, in view of the Iraqi Government's objections to these arrangements and of the common obligations and interests of the two Govern ments, to agree to the following alternative proposals :— 1 (1) That the Iraqi Government should be placed in absolute control of the existing railway system as a going concern. (2) That, in return, the Iraqi Government should :— (a) Undertake in writing that, for a period of twenty years, the railways should be managed by a mixed Anglo-Iraqi board appointed by the Iraqi Government, and that the general managership and a limited number of key posts requiring technical knowledge and experience should be reserved for British subjects; and also that such other non-Iraqi personnel as might be required for the railways should (as provided in the third exchange of notes attached to the treaty of 1930) be recruited from amongst British subjects, provided suitable candidates were available. (b) Make to His Majesty’s Government an immediate cash payment of £650,000. (c) Assume responsibility for any liabilities connected with the railways which have arisen or might arise in the future. 19. When communicating these proposals to the Iraqi Government, Mr. Bateman took the opportunity to draw their attention to the following two points :—- ( 1 ) That His Majesty’s Government would look to the Iraqi Government, if and after the proposed arrangement came into force, to give preference as far as possible to British materials for the railways.8 (2) That His Maiesty’s Government considered that the Iraqi Government were still bound by the relevant provisions of the financial agreement, unless and until both Governments agreed that they should be super seded by a new arrangement. 20. His Maiesty’s Government regarded the actual amount of the price to be paid by the Iraqi Government to be of only secondary importance and from the P beginning His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires was authorised to accept any offer of not 3 less than £500;000 as part of a settlement satisfactory ^ During the September meeting of the Council of the League of Nations it became clear that the only possible means of inducing the Iraqi Government to make a sufficiently generous financial contribution towards the solution of the Assynan problem, which was then under consideration, w ? s . to f £400 000. The Iraqi Government were accordingly informed that His Majesty s Government would accept this reduced payment, provided all the ot ^ e /* of a final settlement of the railway question were integrally adopted by the Ii aq Government. 21. In a note dated the 2nd October the Iraqi Prime Minister accepted these last proposals on two conditions : (lj That Iraqis should be in the majority on the mixed board. (2) That His Majesty’s Government should pay ‘ a sum proportionate to hei share ” towards any compensation which might have to be paid to tne old Bagdad Railway Company. These conditions were accepted in principle. The rest of the year was taken up i n discussing certain points of detail which must be settled before an agreement embodying tins settlement can be finally negotiated. The following were the main points outstanding at the end of the year : (D The number of key posts to be reserved for British subjects. (2) The relations between the Iraqi Government and the mixed board, and in particular the powers to be granted to the latter. (3) The proportion of any compensation to the Bagdad Railway Company to be paid by His Majesty’s Government. Bagdad-Haifa Railway Project. 22 In January His Majesty’s Government decided not to proceed, for the present at any rate, with the proposal to construct a railway between Bagdad and Haifa Interest in this project decreased in Iraq also during U3o, and it is almost certain that the first' efforts of the Iraqi Government, once they have obtained possession of the railways, will be directed towards connecting Mosul and Bagdad by rail Proposed New Museum. 23. His Majesty’s Government were unable to accede to the request of the Iraqi Government that they should hand over as a free gift the plot of railway land at Bagdad West, which is required as the site for a new museum. But, as it is part of the assets of the Iraq Railways, the Iraqi Government will auto matically take possession of it, when the railway system is transferred to them. Draft Law for the Restriction of certain Trades to Iraqis. 24. A Bill for the restriction of certain trades to Iraqis was presented to Parliament in the autumn and passed its third reading in the Chamber ot Deputies on the 2nd December. His Majesty’s Government regarded the Bil with considerable concern, as it threatened to deprive of their means of livelihood a large number of British Indians engaged in trades which were included within its scope. 25. During its passage through the Chamber the Bill was recast in the form of an enabling law giving the Iraqi Government power to issue regulations from time to time restricting the practice of the trades mentioned in it to Iraqi nationals. But, in the^opinion of His Majesty’s Government, the Bill, even in its modified form, was still open to serious objection, since it disregarded the Iraqi Government’s obligations, both under article 14 of the declaration of guarantees made on the occasion of the admission of Iraq to the League of Nations and under the accepted principles of international law, to respect the acquired rights ot9 foreigners in Iraq. His Majesty’s Ambassador was accordingly instructed to make strong representations to the Iraqi Government. On the 23rd December the Prime Minister informed him that he hoped to persuade the Council of Ministers to agree to add to the law, during its passage through the Senate, an additional article to the effect that nothing in the law should contravene the declaration of guarantees. His Majesty’s Government did not, however, consider that this amendment would be sufficient. In their view it was necessary for the Iraqi Government, if they were to observe all their obligations in the matter, to exempt from the law all persons engaged in the trades and occupations covered by its provisions at the time of its entry into force. 26. His Majesty’s Ambassador was accordingly instructed to renew his representations, and the matter was still under discussion at the end of the year. Antiquities Law. 27. The draft Antiquities Law was not actually presented before Parliament until the 4th January, 1936. But a copy was communicated to His Majesty’s Ambassador in November 1935. On examination it proved to be no better than the draft of the previous year, and it was evident that the views expressed by His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires in August 1934, had not been taken into account. His Majesty’s Ambassador accordingly explained these views once again to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and, before the draft was submitted to Parliament, some, though ‘ not all, of the amendments suggested by Sir A. Clark Kerr were approved by the Council of Ministers. 28. Two American and one German expedition came to Iraq to excavate during the season 1935-36. Although the Minister for Foreign Affairs assured His Majesty’s representative on more than one occasion that the provisions of any new law which might be passed would not be applied to archaeologists working during this season, no English expedition has come to Iraq. Civil Procedure Convention. 29. An Anglo-Iraqi Civil Procedure Convention was signed by His Majesty’s Ambassador and the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 25th July. 30. The convention is subject to ratification and is to come into force one month after the date on which ratifications are exchanged. It is to remain in force for three years, and, unless either of the high contracting parties has given six months’ notice of intention to terminate it, will continue to remain m force after the expiration of that period. Thereafter, however, either of the high contracting parties may terminate the convention by giving six months notice of his intention to do so. 31. Ratifications had not been exchanged by the end of the year. General. British War Graves in Iraq. 32. An agreement respecting British war cemeteries, graves and memorials in Iraq was signed on the 15th March by the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs on behalf of the Iraqi Government and by Sir Francis Humphrys on behalf of His Majesty’s Governments in the United Kingdom, Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, and of the Government of India. Article 10 of the agreement provides that it shall come into force on the day of publication in the Official Gazette of the necessary enabling law. A draft of such a law was under preparation, but had not been submitted to Parliament at the end of the year. 33 . Under article 4 the Iraqi Government agree that the lands now occupied by the war cemeteries, graves and memorials shall become the property in perpetuity of the Imperial War Graves Commission; and article 3 provides that the commission shall be represented in Iraq by a committee called I he Iraq Committee of the Imperial War Graves Commission and composed of His Majesty’s representative in Iraq (who shall be chairman) and such six other persons as he may from time to time nominate in agreement with the commission [12931] B 5as members of the committee. In September this committee was duly formed and appointed as the commission’s agency in Iraq, and on the 2/th November it le its lirst meeting. India. Iraqi Consulate at Bombay. 34. In January Ahmad Zaki Beg A1 Ivhayatt was appointed Iraqi consul- general at Bombay. He did not, however, take up his appointment, and in June Ibrahim Beg A1 Khedairy, formerly head of the Consular Section of the Ministry for Foreign^Affairs, proceeded to Bombay as consul. When the Iraqi Govern ment decided to send a consular officer to Bombay, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs assured His Majesty’s Embassy that the Iraqi Government desired that the officials of the Government of India should continue to grant visas for Iraq at places other than Bombay. The Iraqi Government also agreed to continue, for one year, the arrangement by which pilgrims from India are permitted to enter Iraq, if supplied with special passes from the Government of India. British Indians in Iraq. 35 . Throughout the year a number of reports were received from His Majesty’s consul at Basra regarding the harsh treatment which British Indian subjects were receiving at the hands of the police and passport authorities at that port. In particular, deportation orders were served on a number of British Indians who had committed no offence warranting such action. One or two similar cases occurred at Bagdad, and from enquiries made both by His Majesty’s Embassy and by His Majesty s consul at Basra, it became clear that the local authorities were acting on orders received from the Director-General of Police at Bagdad. By means of strong semi-official representations through the British adviser to the Ministry of the Interior, His Majesty’s Embassy were able to prevent many of the deportation orders issued from being carried into effect; and in October definite instructions were issued to the Department of Passports, Residence and Nationality to the effect that, under the Residence Law, only the Minister of the Interior was empowered to issue deportation orders. 36. A more serious threat to the position of British Indians in Iraq was contained in the Bill for the restriction of certain trades to Iraqis, which is discussed in paragraphs 24-26 of this report. Attacks on the Bill appeared in the Indian press, and a number of petitions regarding it were addressed to the Government of India. The situation became easier, however, when it was learnt that His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad had made appropriate representations on behalf of British Indians to the Iraqi Government. Tariff Negotiations. 37. Negotiations between the Governments of Iraq and India on tariff questions are described in paragraph 208 of this report. Palestine. Proposed Modus Vivendi regarding Transit Traffic. 38. A technical difficulty interrupted in March the negotiations for the conclusion of a modus vivendi between Iraq and Palestine. When acceding to commercial treaties concluded between the United Kingdom and certain foreign countries, the Government of Palestine had omitted to obtain an assurance to the effect that the most-favoured-nation clauses contained therein should not prejudice her right to conclude special customs agreements in accordance with the provisions of article 18 of the Palestine mandate. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom at once took steps to obtain the necessary assurances from the countries concerned. But, a certain amount of delay being inevitable, it was felt that negotiations with Iraq could not be held up till affirmative replies had been received from all the countries concerned. In September the High Commissioner for Palestine was authorised to proceed with them on the understanding that if, when final agreement regarding the text was reached, the required assurances had not been received, the Iraqi Government should be asked to conclude a protocol of a purely temporary nature providing that the Government of Palestine should be able to terminate the modus vivendi at six months’ notice. On the 21st October, His Majesty’s Embassy communicated to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, at the instance of the Government of Palestine, a revised draft11 [12931] b 6 of the proposed modus vivendi, together with a provisional plan of the free zone, which is to be allotted to the Iraqi Government at Haifa in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The opportunity was also taken to inform the Iraqi Government that, in order to facilitate the working of the agreement, the Govern ments of Palestine and Transjordan were taking steps to improve those sections of the Bagdad-Haifa route which fall within their respective territories, so that they might be made suitable for motor traffic in all weather. The hope was expressed that the Iraqi Government would be prepared to co-operate by taking similar steps with regard to that section of the route which falls within Iraqi territory. Iraqi Vice-Consul at Haifa. 39 . An Iraqi vice-consul was appointed to Haifa in August. This is the first Iraqi consular appointment in Palestine. Telephone Line between Iraq and Palestine. 40. The telephone line between Iraq and Palestine was formally opened on the 21st November by an exchange of greetings between the Iraqi Prime Minister and a representative of the High Commissioner for Palestine, who was himself indisposed. Transjordan. 41. On the occasion of a visit which His Highness the Amir Abdullah of Transjordan paid to Iraq in November, the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs broached tentatively to His Majesty’s Ambassador the possibility of the union of Transjordan with Iraq. Nuri Pasha said that what he had in mind was a sort of federation which would preserve a very wide measure of autonomy for Transjordan and leave unaltered its existing relations with Great Britain. But his inability to make any suggestions with which to dispose of the obvious difficulties pointed out by His Majesty’s Ambassador seemed to indicate that the idea had not yet been seriously considered by the Iraqi Government. Proposed Customs and Travelling A greements. 42. Early in the year the Transjordan Government decided that the conclusion of the proposed customs agreement between Iraq and Transjordan would he disadvantageous to Transjordan, since both countries exported the same commodities, and, as prices were lower in Iraq than in Transjordan, Iraqi products would, if exempted from customs duty, compete successfully in Transjordan with the products of that country. The chief Minister accordingly informed the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs that the Government of Transjordan were not prepared to proceed with the conclusion of the proposed agreement. But when requested by Nuri Pasha to reconsider this decision, he promised that a revised draft would he prepared on the arrival in Transjordan of the new Director of Customs, and expressed the hope that it might be possible to resume negotiations on the basis of this draft. At the end of the year, however, nothing further had been heard either of the customs agreement or of the proposed travelling agreement, which, it is understood, the Government of Transjordan are still prepared to conclude with the Iraqi Government. A fghanistan. 43. Sardar Faiz Muhammad, the Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs, paid an official visit to Iraq during the last week in December. He was generously entertained by the Iraqi Government and soon established confidential relations with Nuri Pasha. He showed a keen desire to create closer relations between Iraq and Afghanistan, and proposed the early exchange of fully accredited diplomatic missions. He also hinted very broadly that it would be in the interests of the two countries to adopt a common policy towards Iran, of whose arrogance he complained bitterly. Nuri Pasha was cautious. He counselled patience with Iran and temporised about the despatch of an Iraqi diplomatic mission to Kabul. His personal opinion was that this would cost more than it would be worth. The result of these conversations was a draft protocol to the Iraqi-Afghan Treaty of Friendship of December 1932, which provided for close consultation between the two Governments in all matters concerning their common interests. Sardar Faiz Muhammad wished to sign the12 protocol during his visit, but Nuri Pasha asked for a short delay in order to consult His Majesty’s Government. The protocol had consequently not been signed when the Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs left Bagdad for Angora on the 2nd January, 1936. France. 44. The decision of the French Government to agree to the settlement of the Assyrians in Syria (see paragraphs 144—151) did nothing to diminish the instinctive dislike and distrust with which Iraqi politicians appeal to legald the French and all their doings. The unwillingness of the French Government to follow in Syria the example given by His Majesty’s Government in Iraq continued to give rise to adverse comment during the year under review, and it was generally believed that it was only in order to have another excuse for retaining control in Syria that the French authorities agreed to receive the Assyrians there. Further indignation was aroused when the French consul and the French Apostolic Delegate in Mosul showed what was considered to be undue interest in the Christian population of the town during the period of excitement and uneasiness which followed the suppression of the Yezidi revolt. Somewhat exaggerated accounts of the events of this period which appeared in the Syrian newspaper the Orient aroused a storm of criticism and abuse in the Iraqi press. Iraqi Legation in Paris. 45. In June Abdul Aziz-al-Mudhaffar, formerly Iraqi consul-general at Beirut, was appointed to succeed Ahmed Beg Qadir as counsellor at the Iraqi Legation ip Paris. Germany. Iraqi Legation at Berlin. 46. At the beginning of the year the Iraqi Government decided to open a Legation in Berlin, and in January Muzahim Beg A1 Pachachi was appointed to the combined post of Iraqi delegate at Geneva and Iraqi Minister at Rome and Berlin. Muzahim Beg did not, however, proceed to Berlin, and in September a Royal Iradah was issued appointing the Amir Zeid, half-brother of the late King Feisal, Iraqi Minister to that capital. The Amir Zeid presented his letters of credence to the German Chancellor on the 11th October. Presentation of German Order to King Ghazi. 47. On the 29th May the German Minister at Bagdad presented to King Ghazi, on behalf of the German President, the insignia of the Order of the Red Cross. Dr. Grobba informed His Majesty’s Ambassador that the order had been given to King Ghazi in recognition of his humanitarian work as Patron of the Red Crescent Society in Iraq. German Propaganda in Iraq. 48. There have been signs of increasing German interest in Iraq. The cultural activities of the German Legation at Bagdad, the subsidising of a German teacher for the secondary schools, and the steady penetration of Germans into commerce in Bagdad may be cited as instances of such interest. Commercial Treaty. 49. A commercial treaty between Germany and Iraq, based on the principle of reciprocal most-favoured-nation treatment, was signed at Bagdad on the 4th August. The treaty will come into force fifteen days after ratification and will remain in force indefinitely. Each party, however, has the right to terminate it at any time after giving three months’ notice of intention to do so. According to the German Minister, the object of the agreement is to safeguard Germany’s commercial position in Iraq now that she has ceased to be a member of the League of Nations. Libel on German Legation. 50. On the 13th March the local newspaper, the Bilad, published an article, purporting to be an extract from a manuscript of a book written by Amin Rihanfi a well-known Syrian author and journalist, which charged foreign archseological missions working in Iraq with serious malpractices. In particular, the extract[12931] b 7 13 included what was claimed to be a copy of the text of a letter from the curator of the Bagdad Museum to the Minister of Education, which directly charged the German Legation with having surreptitiously removed valuable finds from the Warka site. Ur. Grobba protested vigorously to the Iraqi Government, and informed His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires that he had demanded the dismissal of the curator of the museum, failing which he would ask his Government to recall both Dr. Jordan, the German director of antiquities, and himself. But, as the curator retained his post, it would appear that Dr. Grobba had to content himself with an apology from the Iraqi Government. Iran. General. 51. Khalid Beg Sulaiman, formerly Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs, was appointed Iraqi Minister at Tehran in March and presented his letters of credence to the Shah on the 23rd April. At about the same time, Dr. Naji Beg A1 Asil, who had been Director-General at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, was appointed counsellor to the Iraqi Legation at Tehran. 52. The Accord provisoire of August 1929 between Iraq and Persia was extended for a period of six months from the 11 th February, 1935. On the expiry of this period it was not again extended, since the Iraqi Government felt that the initiative should be taken by the Iranian Government, who did not, however, move in the matter. 53. The provisional agreement for the settlement of frontier incidents, concluded between the Iraqi and Iranian Governments in December 1932, was extended for a period of six months from the 6 th June, 1935. Iranian Nationals resident in Iraq. 54. There are many thousands of Iranians resident in Iraq. They are a constant source of trouble to the Iraqi Government, and during the year under review they were suspected, probably with good reason, of having done much to stir up the trouble which occurred among the Euphrates tribes. For some time the Iraqi Government have been making half-hearted attempts to rid the country of these Iranians, but have met with many difficulties. In December the Iraqi Prime Minister informed His Majesty’s Ambassador that the Bill for the restriction of certain trades to Iraqis (see paragraphs 24-26) was designed to enable the Iraqi Government to deal with this problem. It seems certain that this is the main purpose of the Bill, regarding which the Iranian Minister at Bagdad has made ineffective representations to the Iraqi Government. Iraqi-Iranian Frontier Dispute. 55. The dispute between Iraq and Iran concerning their common frontier was put on the agenda of the January session of the Council of the League of Nations. At the instance of the Iranian delegation (headed by M. Kazemi) the Italian representative, Baron Aloisi, was appointed rapporteur. The Iraqi delegation would have preferred the representative of some State not in any way connected with the affairs of either party to the dispute, but they hesitated to object to any proposal without serious reason. Nuri Pasha, the Iraqi represen tative, stated his case before the Council on the 14th January. He argued that the boundary between Iraq and Iran had been defined in certain valid instruments which were binding on both sides and should be respected. M. Kazemi spoke on the following day and contended that the treaties and other documents to which Nuri Pasha had referred were not valid in international law and were, therefore, not recognised by the Iranian Government. In the conversations which followed with the rapporteur, the Iraqi delegation urged that, as the difference between the two Governments rested on a point of international law, the Council should refer the dispute for an advisory opinion to the International Court of Justice at The Hague. The Iranian delegation would not, however, agree to this proposal and, as no alternative course had been adopted before the Council session ended, it was decided that the rapporteur, Nuri Pasha and M. Kazemi should meet again in Rome at the end of January and renew their efforts to find a solution acceptable to both sides.14 50. At Rome Nuri Pasha found Baron Aloisi at first more concerned to press him to sign a treaty of friendship which had been under negotiation or some time between Iraq and Italy, than to solve the Iraqi-lranian irontiei question. Nuri Pasha succeeded in avoiding this entanglement and brought the conversations back to their real subject. No progress was, however, made. Baron Aloisi and his assistants persistently favoured Iranian designs and did then utmost to persuade Nuri Pasha to accept a provisional agreement for the inter national control of the Shatt-el-Arab which would have evaded a decision on Iraq’s claim to sovereignty over the whole waterway and given the Iranians all they wanted. There was no doubt that the Iranians intended that this provisional arrangement, once put into effect, should become permanent. Nuri Pasha maintained that he had no authority to discuss any proposal of this kind, and on the 7th February, having received instructions to return to Iraq on account of the Cabinet crisis, he left Rome for Bagdad. 57. The dispute was again taken to Geneva in May. A member of the Italian delegation, Signor Soragna, acting on behalf of the rapporteur, elaborated new proposals for a settlement. These provided for (a) the reaffirmation of the 1914 boundary from the Turkish frontier to the sea, but modified as in (b ); {b) the extension of the Mohammerah anchorage southwards to a point opposite Bawarda below Abadan giving Iran half the river for about 20 miles instead of 6 ; {c) the conclusion of a conservancy and navigation agreement; (d) the withdrawal of Iranian police posts in Iraqi territory and the settlement of outstanding questions concerning the division of the waters of streams crossing the boundary. These proposals were, at the time, rejected by both delegations, but before the Council session ended it was agreed that they should be the subject of direct discussions later in the year. 58. An Iraqi delegation, headed again by Nuri Pasha, accordingly visited Tehran early in August. A number of proposals were then examined, including several drafts with which the Iranians tried to trick the Iraqis into giving them effective sovereignty over half of the Shatt-el-Arab. 59. These methods did not succeed, and although the Iraqis continued to elaborate the details of their offer that, in return for recognition by Iran of the 1914 frontier, they would endeavour to remove all the practical disabilities which this frontier might create for Iranian interests, their efforts at conciliation elicited no response from the Iranians. Nevertheless, when, at a final audience of the Shah, Nuri Pasha spoke favourably of the rapporteur's proposal that Iraq should cede to Iran an anchorage off Abadan, he found the Shah sympathetic and apparently willing to accept the existing frontier subject to this one adjust ment. There was then no time left to go into details, but it was decided to resume negotiations at Geneva during the September session of the Council. On this occasion, however, the Iranians showed far more interest in a tripartite pact of non-aggression sponsored by Turkey than in the boundary dispute, which was again adjourned for further direct negotiations in Bagdad. 60. The Iranian delegation, headed by M. Samii, Iranian Minister at Bagdad, assembled at Bagdad on the 11 th December. The Iraqi delegates were Nasrat-al-Farisi from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Yusuf Ghanima from the Ministry of Finance, and Khalil Ismail from the Ministry of the Interior Calls were exchanged and dinner parties given, but work was difficult as neither side had been given precise instructions by their Governments. The Iraqi Govern ment had, howeyei, decided that it would be best to begin by discussing the proposed convention establishing equal co-operation between Iraq and Iran in the control and regulation of navigation and conservancy in the Shatt-el-Arab and it was believed that the Iranian delegation would agree to this procedure A convention of this kind had long been recommended by His Majesty’s Govern ment m the United Kingdom as the best way of removing the practical difficulties created for Iran by the 1914 frontier and both Governments had been given the araft of a suitable text. His Majesty’s Government had also made it known to both sides that, in view of the fact that 90 per cent, of the ocean-going shipping using the Shatt-el-Arab flew the British flag, Great Britain woufd expect to be invited to be a signatory to any convention for the control of conservancy and navigation which might be negotiated between the two countries. ^15 [12931] B 8 61. The Iraqi Government, perhaps with some reluctance, accepted this contention and agreed to invite His Majesty’s Government to be parties to the convention. A few days after the arrival of the Iranian delegation, Nuri Pasha communicated to His Majesty’s Ambassador, for his approval, the text of an identic note, which he proposed to ask the Iranian delegation to issue jointly with the Iraqi delegation, inviting Ills Majesty’s Government to participate in the negotiations for the proposed convention. Sir A. Clark Kerr at once pointed out that His Majesty’s Government had strong claims to be a third party to the convention and could not accept an invitation merely to take part in the negotiations preceding its conclusion. He also discussed the point with the Prime Minister, who explained that, although the Iraqi Government were themselves quite willing that Great Britain should be a signatory to the convention, they feared that they would scare the Iranians if, at the beginning, they were to ask them to agree. At the same time he said that he would not object to proposing a joint invitation to His Majesty’s Government to negotiate and sign the convention, if the Iranian Government could be persuaded beforehand to instruct their delegation to concur in such a proposal. The situation was reported to the Secretary of State and to His Majesty’s Minister in Tehran and the latter found an early opportunity to ask the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs whether the Iranian Government would instruct their delegation in the sense desired. M. Kazemi replied that although he saw no objection to a repre sentative of His Majesty’s Government participating in the negotiations, it was not possible for the Iranian Government to agree that Great Britain should be a party to the convention itself. Meanwhile, the Christmas and Id al Fitr holidays and the visit of the Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs further delayed the opening of negotiations in Bagdad, and there had been no formal meeting of the two delegations before the year ended. Middle-Eastern Pact of Non-Aggression. 62. It has been related above that during the September sessions of the Council and Assembly of the League of Nations, the Iranian delegation at Geneva made a special effort to bring Iraq into a tripartite pact of non-aggression with Iran and Turkey. As the Turkish Foreign Minister was also an enthusiastic sponsor of this pact, the Iraqis thought it politic to agree, and before they left Geneva a member of the Iraqi delegation initialled a draft ad referendum to the Iraqi Government. The draft was, at the same time, initialled by M. Kazemi on behalf of Iran and by Jemal Husni, the Turkish Minister at Berne. 63. The Iraqi Government do not intend that the pact shall be signed until the frontier dispute has been settled. Treaty for the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes. 64. A draft treaty between Iran and Iraq for the peaceful settlement of disputes was also similarly initialled by a member of each delegation. The text followed closely a model treaty prepared in 1928 by the League Committee on Arbitration and Security and does not call for comment. Disputes concerning territory are specifically excluded from its provisions. Treaty of Friendship. 65 Some effort was made during the discussions at Geneva in the autumn to combine a short treaty of friendship with the proposed cession to Iran of a strip of water at Abadan and the conservancy and navigation convention. Numerous points of serious difference were, however, encountered, and the negotiations did not progress further than the exchange of several tentative drafts and counter-drafts put forward as material for discussion. Italy. Proposed Treaty of Friendship. 66 . The attempts which Baron Aloisi made, in connexion with the Iraqi- Iranian frontier negotiations, to persuade the Iraqi Minister for loreign Affairs to sign the proposed treaty of friendship between Iraq and Italy are descnbed in paragraph 56 of this report. In view of Baron Aloisi s attitude and of the opposition of the Turkish Government to the proposed treaty, Nuii Pasha decided to refuse to discuss it further so long as Baron Aloisi continued to be connected with the frontier dispute.16 67. As a result of developments connected with the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia, the question of the conclusion of the proposed treaty was no proceeded with. Iraqi Attitude towards the I talo- Abyssinian Dispute. 68 . On the 30th October the Iraqi Parliament passed a law enabling the ft** Government to give effect, by regulation, to article 16 of the Covenant. n ic 11th November a regulation'enforcing sanctions against Italy was issued under the terms of this law. The regulation was a simplified version of the British Order in Council of the 25th October. 69. In November the Iraqi Government, like other Governments who were enforcing sanctions against Italy, received a note of protest from the Italian Government. The Iraqi Government consulted His Majesty s Embassy in the matter, and the reply which they eventually returned to the Italian note followed closely the wording of the reply sent by His Majesty’s Government, only differing therefrom where the language of the note sent by His Majesty s Government was not appropriate to Iraq. 70. With the exception of one newspaper, which was known to bo in the pay of the Italian Legation at Bagdad, Iraqi newspapers were unanimous in condemning Italy’s invasion of Abyssinia, and it is understood that several protests were received from the Italian Charge d’Affaires at Bagdad on account of the tone of leading articles. Koweit. 71. The settlement of questions affecting the relations between Iraq and Koweit has, during the past few years, and particularly during 1935, been rendered more difficult by the fact that the impression prevails at Koweit that it is the policy of the Iraqi Government gradually to bring Koweit under her political influence, with ultimate intentions of annexation. The Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs assured His Majesty’s Ambassador on numerous occasions during 1935 that the Iraqi Government had no such intentions and were eager to establish amicable relations with the sheikh, whom they regarded as a friendly Arab ruler. But, unfortunately, articles appeared from time to time in the Iraqi press designed to give the impression that Iraq desired to annex Koweit, and that Koweitis as a whole were in favour of such annexation. In response to protests from His Majesty’s representative at Bagdad, the Iraqi Government denied that there was any foundation for these articles, and on two occasions issued dementis. Nevertheless, the appearance of such articles could not fail to strengthen Koweiti suspicions. Smuggling. 72. This atmosphere of suspicion has made it particularly difficult to reach any satisfactory arrangement for the co-operation of the Sheikh of Koweit in the efforts of the Iraqi Government to prevent smuggling between Koweit and Iraq. 73. His Majesty’s Government were disposed to comply with the request made by the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs in December 1934 that they should act as mediators between Iraq and Koweit in this matter. But the measures considered necessary by the Iraqi Government, if smuggling were to be effectively put down, seemed to His Majesty’s Government to go°too far, whilst those which His Majesty’s Government were prepared to recommend to the sheikh were not considered adequate by the Iraqi Government. It was, therefore, not until May that, after prolonged discussions between His Majesty’s Embassy and the competent authorities of the Iraqi Government, His Majesty’s Ambassador was able to inform the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty’s Government were prepared to use their good offices and to urge the sheikh strongly to accept a solution on bases which might be briefly and generally summarised as follows :— ( 1 ) The appointment of a British customs director at Koweit with special powers (not excluding the possibility of limiting the import of certain commodities), who would work in close liaison with the Iraqi customs authorities and the Political Agent at Koweit[12931] B 9 17 (2) The co-operation of the Sheikh of Koweit in making effective a frontier control and customs cordon system to be set up by the liaqi Government. 74. It was suggested that details should be worked out at a conference to be presided over by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. The liaqi Government replied that they were prepared to attend such a conference and saw no objection to its being held at Koweit, on the understanding that Pie discussions should not necessarily be confined to the measures proposed by His Majesty’s Government. But the Sheikh of Koweit, who was immediately approached on the subject, said that he would be unable to accept even the proposals of His Majesty’s Government, and that he therefore saw no use in holding the conference. A letter which the sheikh addressed to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf made it clear that his attitude was due to the fact that he was unable to face the possibility of being held partly responsible by his subjects—as he would be if he co-operated with the Iraqi Government—for the losses which they would suffer as a result of the suppression of smuggling. He therefore preferred that the Iraqi Government should act unilaterally, even though they were forced to take stronger measures than would have been necessary if he had been willing to co-operate. 75. The Sheikh of Koweit paid a visit to London in June, and the opportunity was taken to make a last effort to persuade him to co-opeiate. The sheikh did', in fact, agree to adopt a system whereby all goods exported from Koweit, and consigned to or through Iraqi territory by land as well as by sea, should carry manifests issued on his personal responsibility. But the Iraqi Government were not satisfied with this proposal and, in a note dated the 11th September, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty’s Embassy that the Iraqi Government had decided themselves to initiate measures to combat smuggling forthwith. The Ministry did not give details of the measures which it was proposed to take, but the Prime Minister assured His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires that they were preventive only, and that he had given strict orders that there were to be no incursions into Koweiti territory. 76. During the remainder of the year frequent accounts of the capture of smuggled goods appeared in the Iraqi press, and from reports received fiom the Political Accent at Koweit it appeared that the measures taken by the Iraqi Government^ had been to a large extent effective. The Sheikh of Koweit also professed to be satisfied with the situation, and to be glad that the Iraqi Government had themselves assumed the burden of preventing smuggling and that he had not been forced to share it. Frontier Incidents. 77. The orders which the Prime Minister informed Mr. Bateman that he had issued in regard to incursions into Koweiti territory were effective, for no reports of such incursions were received after the adoption of preventive measuies by the Iraqi Government. The only report of this nature received by His Majesty’s Embassy during 1935 concerned the alleged entry into Koweiti territorial waters in July of an Iraqi customs launch, which was said to have delayed and searched Koweiti craft. Representations were made to the Iraqi Government who, however, denied that any Iraqi customs launch had ciossed into Koweiti territorial waters, and suggested'that the facts had been misrepresented by a Koweiti victim of the legitimate anti-smuggling measures carried out by such launches within Iraqi territorial waters. No evidence was produced in support of these contentions. 78. An incident of a slightly different nature occurred earlier in the summer. At the end of May the withdrawal of the armed cars of the Iraqi desert police from their normal duties to reinforce the police forces which were dealing with the disturbances on the Middle Euphrates led to an outbreak of raiding by Iraqi tribesmen into Koweit. At the request of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, His Majesty’s Ambassador made representations to the Iraqi Government, who at once took effective preventive measures.Properties of the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah in Iraq. 79. On the 28th January Sir Francis Humphrys addressed a note to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs setting out certain proposals for the settlement of the difficulties connected with the properties in Iiaq belonging to the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah. These proposals may be summarised as follows :— ( 1 ) On the understanding that the Iraqi Government would ensure that the sheikh was given a legally valid and unassailable title to his Faddaghiyah property (except that portion of the Bashiyah section of it which has already been alienated from the sheikh by a court judgment), His Majesty’s Government would contribute a sum not exceeding £ 2,000 towards the expenses which might be incurred in carrying out the necessary transactions. (2) Provided that full effect was given to this arrangement, and on the further understanding that the Iraqi Government would— (a) Undertake to make no claim for arrears of taxation against the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah in respect of their properties in Iraq, and (b) Give a written assurance that no discriminatory taxation would be imposed on the properties of either of these sheikhs in future, His Majesty’s Government would raise no further claim for the exemption from taxation of the properties which these two sheikhs own in Iraq. 80. The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, who was also Minister of Justice, appeared to view these proposals favourably, but repeated representations failed to extract an answer from the Iraqi Government, and at the end of the year no further progress had been made. Fao Estate. 81. As a result of continued intervention by His Majesty’s Embassy, the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs eventually agreed to forward to them, for service through the diplomatic channels, the necessary documents to enable the Sheikh of Koweit to swear the oaths required by the court in the cases connected with his Fao estates. It seemed that a further difficulty was being put in the way of the sheikh, when a report was received to the effect that the Iraqi authorities had refused to authenticate a general power of attorney granted by the sheikh to his lawyer. But it afterwards turned out that the power of attorney, which should have been presented to the Basra court for authentication, had been brought by a friend of the sheikh’s lawyer to Bagdad, where undue notice of it had been taken. When, on the advice of His Majesty’s Embassy, the power of attorney was presented in the normal way to the Basra court, it was at once accepted. Post and Telegraph Services. 82. A statement of receipts and expenditure of the combined post and telegraph office at Koweit, which was supplied to His Majesty’s Embassy by the Iraqi Government in April, seemed to show that the office was at last being run at a profit. Subsequently, the possibility of taking the administration of these services out of the hands of the Iraqi Posts and Telegraphs Department was again considered, and proposals for their separate administration were still under discussion between the India Office and Cable and Wireless (Limited) at the end of the year. Saudi Arabia. 83. Relations between Iraq and Saudi Arabia continued to be cordial throughout the year, the Saudi Arabian Government in particular showing evident desire to bring about a closer friendship between the two States. Treaty Negotiations. 84. In the earlier part of the year negotiations for the conclusion of a treaty of friendship between Saudi Arabia and Iraq were carried on both in Jedda and in London. A number of drafts were produced by both parties andthe Iraqi Government were, at their own request, furnished with the observations of His Majesty’s Government on one of these drafts. But no progress was made, and at the end of the year it became clear that the Saudi Arabian Government still preferred the proposal for a treaty of alliance, which Fuad Beg Hamza made to the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs in London in 1934. In December Nuri Pasha informed His Majesty’s Ambassador that Sheikh Yusuf Yasin would come to Bagdad early in 1936 to discuss proposals for such a treaty. At the same time, he said that he understood the special interest of His Majesty’s Government in the matter and promised to keep Sir A. Clark Kerr fully informed of all developments. Middle-Eastern Pact of Non-A ggression. 85. About the time when the tripartite pact of non-aggression between Turkey, Iraq and Iran was initialled, there was some talk of Saudi Arabia becoming a party to it, and the Iraqi Government were believed to have approached the Saudi Arabian Government in the matter. But it is understood that Ibn Sand does not regard the pact with favour. He is opposed to inter national commitments, and Saudi Arabia, not being a member of the League of Nations, would find difficulty in adhering to a pact which is based on the Covenant of the League. In this connexion it is interesting to note that the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, when discussing Saudi-Iraqi relations with the head of the Eastern Department of the Foreign Office in the summer, said that he proposed to urge the Saudi Arabian Government to apply for membership of the League of Nations. Najaf-Medina Pilgrimage Route. 86 . A temporary agreement between the Iraqi and Saudi Arabian Govern ments regarding the control of the overland pilgrimage route from Najaf to Medina was signed at Jedda on the 12th February. Furthei details legarding this agreement are given in paragraphs 245 and 246 of this report. Efain. Proposed Commercial A greement. 87. In 1933 the Spanish Government increased the duty on Iraqi dates, and a considerable decrease in the quantities of dates imported by Spain Iraq resulted. The Iraqi Government accordingly took the opportunity of the visit of M Olivan to Bagdad in May to raise this question. At M. Olivan s suggestion the Iraqi Government drew up a draft commercial agreement and communicated this draft to him after his return to Geneva. Negotiations for the conclusion of this agreement were, at the end of the yeai, still being pursued between the Spanish Embassy and the Iraqi Legation in London. 88 . The possibility of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Iraq and Spain is also under consideration. Siceden. Commercial A greement. 89. A provisional commercial agreement was concluded between the Govern ment of Iraq and the Swedish Government by means of notes exchanged at Bagdad on the 3rd November. The notes embody a simple most-favoured-nation agreement, exception being made by both parties in respect of advantages which may be accorded to certain neighbouring countries, or by virtue of an eventual customs union. Syria. 90. The settlement reached regarding the transfer of Assyrians from Iraq to Syria is discussed in paragraphs 144-151 of this report. 91 On the 11th May the French Ambassador in London addressed a letter to Sir R. Vansittart in which he expressed the hope that, in view of the action which the French Government had taken m the matter of the Assyrians, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would use their influence m e direction of ensuring (1) that the Iraqi Government should do not mg o encourage the Syrian nationalist elements to exploit for their own purpose the services rendered to Iraq by the French Government in agreeing to receive the [12931] B 1020 Assyrians in Syria; (2) that the Iraqi Government should show more goodwill in the solution of questions outstanding between Iraq and Syria; and (3) that the Iraqi Government should take special care to prevent any premature Assyrian exodus into Syria. 92. The first and third of these requests were borne in mind throughout the negotiations for the settlement of the Assyrians in Syria, and, fortunately, the fears which had prompted them proved to be groundless. 93 . The Ambassador’s second request referred to the following questions, on which the French Charge d’Affaires was attempting to negotiate with the Iraqi Government:— (a) A “ bon-voisinage ” agreement. (b) The creation of machinery for the settlement of frontier incidents. \c) An agreement for the eviction of undesirables. (d) A tariff convention. (e) A trans-desert agreement. (/) The final settlement of the tribal cases dealt with at the Palmyra Conference of October 1934. M. Lepissier also asked for the help of His Majesty’s Government in these matters, and His Majesty’s Ambassador took an early opportunity to urge upon the Iraqi Prime Minister that it was in the best interests of the Iraqi Government to meet, as far as possible, the desires of the French Government. 94. For reasons explained below, it was found impossible to reach a final settlement of the tribal cases dealt with at the Palmyra Conference. But agree ment was reached regarding the procedure to be followed for the settlement of frontier incidents, and notes embodying this agreement were exchanged between the French Charge d’Affaires and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. 95. The Iraqi Government also gave serious consideration to the draft bon-voisinage ’ ’ agreement and, whilst accepting a number of articles of the French draft, gave M. Lepissier a counter-draft of other parts of it. During a visit to Beirut in May, the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs discussed with the High Commissioner the form which the agreement should take. On his return to Bagdad, he was hopeful that he had persuaded the Comte de Martel to agree that it should be concluded in proper treaty form and signed by a Syrian on behalf of the Syrian Government. If this is so, the main'difficulty in the way of the conclusion of the agreement has been removed. 96. Negotiations on the remaining questions had not been completed when M. Lepissier left Bagdad on leave at the end of July. But he expressed himself as pleased with the progress made and thanked His Majesty’s Ambassador for the assistance which he had received from His Majesty’s Embassy. 97. M. Lepissier did not return to Bagdad before the end of the year and the negotiations were not continued during his absence. The Palmyra Conference. Palmyra Conference for the Liquidation of Tribal Incidents on the Syna-Iraq Frontier, which was held on the 11 th October, 1934, a lar°-e numbei of cases were settled and only one incident gave rise to serious disagree ment. 1 his incident concerned the Ituwallah tribe and had occurred during their seasonal migration from Syria to Nejd. A partial settlement of the incident had already been reached between the Governments of Iraq and Nejd The French authorities, however, took up the case on the ground that the Ruwallah were a Syrian tribe, and included it in the agenda of the conference. The Iraqi representatives contended that the case was one for settlement with the Nejdi and not the Synan Government, and a Nejdi delegate who attended the conference supported this contention. The French delegates would not accept the Iraqi thesis, and, unfortunately, the Syrian authorities subsequently made ratification of the findings of the conference conditional on the payment by Iraq of a sum of 50,000 fr. to the Ruwallah in settlement of the incident in question This the Iraqi Government are unwilling to do, and, unless a compromise can be found the work of the conference will have been in vain.I L 21 Extension of Alejpfo-Tel Ziouane Railway. 99 . By the beginning of 1935 the Syrian authorities had completed the extension of the Aleppo-Tei Ziouane Railway up to the Iraqi frontier at Tel Kotchek, and the new line was inaugurated by the French High Commissioner in Syria on 2nd May. 100. At present the only effect of the extension is that the distance which railway passengers from Europe to Iran or Iraq have to cover in motor cars has been shortened by some 70 kilom. But His Majesty’s acting consul at Mosul, who attended the opening ceremony, was impressed by the fact that the eyes of the High Commissioner and the French authorities were evidently turned towards Mosul. Turkey. 101. During 1935 it became evident that Turkish example was exercising an increasing influence on the Iraqi mind. The effect was seen mainly in certain administrative and legislative acts of the Iraqi Government. The causes may be found partly in the advent to power of Yassin Pasha, partly in the admiration felt by the average Iraqi nationalist for M. Atatlirk, and partly in the fact that Turkey, fearing that she might become involved in war with Italy as a result of the Abyssinian embroglio, started to look round for friends, and in this connexion to pay a certain amount of attention to the new State of Iraq. 102. It has already been related that it was the Turkish Foreign Minister who sponsored the tripartite pact of non-aggression initialled by representatives of the Turkish, Iranian and Iraqi Governments at Geneva (see paiagiaphs 62 and 63). M. Rushdi Aras was also largely instrumental in persuading Nun Pasha not to sign the proposed Treaty of Friendship between Iraq and Italy, and a personal appeal which he addressed to the Shah of Iran and to the Iraqi 1 rime Minister in August no doubt helped to persuade the Iraqi and Iranian Govern ments to attempt to settle by direct negotiations the Iraqi-Iranian frontier dispute, which was then in the hands of the Council of the League of Nations. United States. Archceology. 103. Two of the three foreign archaeological expeditions excavating in.Iraq at the end of 1935 were American. The American Minister in Bagdad conse quently showed considerable interest in the question of the conditions undei which foreign expeditions would be allowed to excavate under the terms of the new Antiquities Law, and associated himself with the representations made by His Majesty’s Ambassador on this subject (see paragraph 27 above) Mr. Knabenshue was responsible for the following proposal, which is likely to be included m the new law :— “ That the finds of an excavation should be divided into three lots—one for the expedition who found them, one for the Iraqi Museum, and one to be held in suspense in Iraq and to be used to help towards a fair division m subsequent years.' A merican Schools. 104. Apart from archseology, the chief non-commercial American interest in Iraq is that of the schools run by American missionaries m Bagdad. It is understood that Mr. Knabenshue has had considerable difficulty in persuading the Iraqi Government to extend to the senior students at these schools the exemption from the provisions of the Conscription Law which has been granted to students of other schools in Iraq. Yemen. 105. Ten Yemeni officers arrived in Bagdad early in October to undergo a course of training with the Iraqi army.

Laws authorising the Iraqi Government to accede to the following international conventions were passed on the date noted hereunder : — Date of Enabling Law. February 23, 1935. (1) Agreement concerning Manned Lightships not at their Stations (Lisbon, 23rd October, 1930) ...

(4) International Sanitary Convention for Aerial Navigation (The Hague, 12th April, 1933^1 The accession of Iraq to the declaration at (2) was registered with the Secretariat of the League of Nations on the 17th April, 1935. February 25. 1935. February 25, 1935. February 25, 1935. II.— Internal Affairs (Political). The Royal Family. 108. The Royal family suffered two losses in the early part of the year. In February ex-King Ali of the Hejaz, uncle and father-in-law of King Ghazi, died of heart failure, and towards the end of March the Queen Mother succumbed to a similar attack. 109. In May the Queen gave birth to a son and heir, who wms named Faisal, after his grandfather. This event caused great satisfaction throughout the country and served to give the King a brief spell of popularity. 110. During 1935 the King showed much interest in the army. At the end of the operations on the Euphrates he inspected the units which had taken part and warmly complimented them on their success and, on the occasion of the anniversary of his succession, a large parade, in which all branches of the service took part, was held in his honour. The King’s interest is much appreciated by the army and is contrasted with the indifference of the late King Faisal. 111. Unfortunately, however, he does not show similar interest in other spheres of the life of the country and although with the help of Rustam Beg Haidar, his chief private secretary, he successfully handled two political crises in the spring, he showed few signs during the year of having inherited his father’s qualities as a leader and statesman. Parliament and Political Events. Parliamentary Session of 1934-35. 112. The session, which opened on the 29th December, was adjourned on the 12th March, on account of the disorders which had broken out on the Middle and Lower Euphrates. On the 9th April, after the formation of a new Cabinet by[12931] b 12 -23 Yassin Pasha, the Chamber was dissolved. The principal enactments of the session, apart from financial measures and laws enabling the Iraqi Government to accede to international treaties and agreements, were :— (a) Law prohibiting the export of date palm cuttings from Iraq. (b) Diplomatic and Consular Privileges Law. (c) The Agricultural and Industrial Bank Law. (d) The Post Office Savings Bank Law. Considerable time was also devoted to discussion of a new Penal Code. One hundred and forty sections passed their second reading, but many remained to be examined. The Government and the Opposition. 113. The general election which took place early in December 1934 gave the then Prime Minister, Ali Jaudat Beg, and his party an overwhelming majority in the Chamber of Deputies, and at the beginning of the- new year, when Parliament assembled, they believed their position to be strong. They did not realise how much personal bitterness they had provoked by excluding from the Chamber many of the leaders of other parties and groups, nor did they under stand the widespread unpopularity which they had incurred by forcing on provincial constituencies a number of unknown nonenties from Bagdad, whose election had deprived men of local standing of their seats. The truth was, however, soon brought home to them by a sudden and unexpected attack launched during the debate on the Speech from the Throne. The Speech was colourless in itself and the usual loyal replies from both Houses were expected. But the Opposition chose this occasion to unmask some of their guns. In the Chamber the huge Government bloc was strong enough to withstand without difficulty a sharp cannonade of criticism, but in the Senate, where the Ikha-al-Watani (the “Party of National Brotherhood”), led by Yassin Pasha and Rashid Ali-al-Gilani, could rally nine of the twenty members, the attack was pressed with great vigour. In spite of a spirited defence, the Government lost the day, and the Senate’s reply to the Speech from the Throne contained criticism of the dissolution of the previous September and of the way in which the elections had been conducted, which were tantamount to a vote of censure on the Cabinet. The Opposition press was jubilant at this unexpected display of energy in the usually supine and amenable Senate, but the Prime Minister and his colleagues, blind to the gathering storm, treated the incident as being of little consequence. 114. Yassin and Rashid Ali quickly followed up their success in the Senate by organising a widespread agitation against the Government in all parts of the country. In the north they encouraged a revival of the racial and linguistic grievances of the Kurds; in the south they rallied to their support their old partisan, the turbulent Sheikh of the Fatlah, Abdul Wahid; and throughout the country they stimulated resentment among the tribal chiefs against the discourtesy with which they were habitually treated by Government officials, and focussed this discontent on Ali Jaudat’s Cabinet. In the towns they found it easy to gather to their side a band of disappointed would-be Deputies, and the benevolent approbation of the Holy Cities was won by a subtle suggestion of sympathy with the sectarian aspirations of the Shiah community. In Bagdad the anti-Government bloc in the Senate maintained an obstructive opposition to all Government measures, and the lawyers, always a dangerous element in oriental politics, were whipped in by the Suwaidi brothers, both of whom were being kept out of lucrative employment by Ali Jaudat Beg’s Administration. The Prime Minister had also to face difficulties with his colleagues. Arshad-al- Umari had become most unpopular on account of his summary dismissals of a large number of senior officials in the Ministry of Economics and Communications, and his reckless disregard of all experienced advice in the conduct of the work of his Ministry was rapidly reducing its affairs to chaos. Jamil-al-Madfai constantly disagreed with his chief on important issues, and Yusuf-al-Ghanimah, though a hard-working Minister, had no influence in political circles. Ali Jaudat struggled on, and his ultimate fall was delayed first by the death of King Ali, and then by the early floods of the Tigris, which for a few days threatened to inundate'the capital. The respite which these events brought from the increasing pressure of the Opposition was, however, only temporary, and on the 23rd February, unable any longer to resist the manoeuvres of his opponents, he submitted his resignation to the King.mmmmnn 24 115. The King, acting on the advice of the Presidents of the Senate and Chamber, invited Yassin Pasha to form a Ministry, but stipulated that there should be no dissolution, and that Rashid Ali and Hikmat Sulaiman, who had been prominently associated with the agitation organised among the Luphrates tribes by the Opposition, should not be included in his Cabinet. These conditions Yassin was unable to accept, and the King had to look elsewhere for a new Prime Minister. Jamil-al-Madfai''s Cabinet. 116. After some days of consultation with a number of prominent men in public life, His Majesty sent for Jamil-al-Madfai, who succeeded on the 3rd March in forming the following Cabinet:— Prime Minister : Jamil-al-Madfai. Minister for Foreign Affairs : Nuri-al-Said. Minister for Justice : Tawfiq-al-Suwaidi. Minister for the Interior : Abdul Azziz-al-Qassab. Minister for Finance : Yusuf Ghanima. Minister for Economics and Communications : Amin Zaki. Minister for Defence : Rashid-al-Khojah. Minister for Education : Abdul Hussain Chalabi. The change of Ministers did nothing to appease the Opposition, who continued unabated their intrigues among the tribes of the Middle Euphrates. On the 9 th March, in collusion with the cabal in Bagdad, Abdul Wahid, chief of the Fatlah tribe, mobilised his tribesmen and took control of the Abu Sukhair district of the Diwaniyah liwa. No fighting occurred, but the police and the civil officials were confined to their quarters and houses. Three days later a strong section of the Aqrab tribe seized an important irrigation regulator at Daghgharah and a spirit of open defiance began to spread. All the tribes of the Middle Euphrates did not, however, join the movement. Those of long-standing traditional hostility towards Abdul Wahid and the Fatlah tribe rallied to the support of the authorities and met the war dances of the insurgents with equally warlike counter-capers. They even offered to attack the insurgent elements, but the Government, not wishing to plunge the whole district into tribal warfare, wisely declined these offers and counselled patience. On the 12th March Parliament was prorogued for a month. On the following day the Government despatched a military force southwards from Hillah to Diwaniyah, whilst the Minister for the Interior was already at Diwaniyah trying to reach a peaceful settlement. Abdul Wahid and his followers were, however, in daily touch with Rashid Ali-al-Gilani and other Opposition leaders in Bagdad, who urged them to refuse to discuss the situation with any representatives of Jamil Beg’s Cabinet. By the 15th March the troops had occupied Abu Sukhair without opposition from the tribes and were in position for an advance against the insurgents. At that point there were doubts about their loyalty. Many of the officers were believed to be strongly in sympathy with the rebels , 1 and the majority of the rank and file, being Shiahs, could not, in the absence of strong leadership, be expected to fight well against their co-religionists. In the face of this uncertainty and, possibly, because they genuinely disliked the prospect of a civil war, the Government hesitated. The Cabinet were divided as to the proper course to follow, and on the evening of the 15th March they resigned. Yassin Pasha's Cabinet. 117. The King immediately sent for Yassin-al-Hashimi, and this time made no conditions. The formation of the following Cabinet was announced on the 17th March :— Prime Minister : Yassin-al-Hashimi. Minister for Foreign Affairs : Nuri-al-Said. Minister for Justice : Muhammad Zaki. Minister for Interior : Rashid Ali-al-Gilani. Minister for Finance: Rauf-al-Bahrani. Minister for Economics and Communications : Amin Zaki Minister for Defence : Jafar-al-Askari. Minister for Education : Muhammad Ridha-al-Shabibi.25 [12931] B 13 After assuming office, the Cabinet at once issued a communique declaring their intention to govern justly and appealing to those “whose minds had been disturbed by recent events ’’ to return peacefully to their homes. The new Minister of the Interior then set out on a rapid tour of the disturbed area of the Diwaniyah liwa. He had two tasks : The first was to persuade Abdul Wahid and his associates to disperse; and the second, to pacify Abdul Wahid’s tribal ^ enemies, who were indignant and outraged at his success. He achieved his first object without great difficulty (though it is possible that the payment of a large sum of money to Abdul Wahid was necessary). But he was less successful with the sheikhs who had supported the previous Governments. They felt that, as Abdul Wahid had played so prominent a part in bringing Yassin Pasha and his colleagues into office, he would enjoy great influence with the Government and would naturally use this influence to get the better of his tribal rivals and enemies. They were deeply suspicious of the new Cabinet and adopted an openly hostile and threatening attitude towards the Minister of the Interior. Nevertheless, the Government continued to try to win their confidence and held prolonged discussions with many of them in Bagdad. The Shiah Ulema. 118. At this stage some of the ulema of Najaf decided to make an effort to turn the situation to the profit of the Shiah community. Their leader, Sheikh Muhammad Hasan Kashif-al-Ghata, entered into negotiations with the anti- Abdul Wahid (and now anti-Government) sheikhs of the Middle Euphrates and concluded with them a pact of mutual assistance. He promised them the spiritual support of the Holy Cities against Abdul Wahid in return for their material support of his sectarian demands. The sheikhs accepted this arrange ment, not because they were deeply interested in the perennial struggle of the Shiah leaders to win parity with the Sunnis in political power, but because they realised that, with the ulema on their side, they would be in a far stronger position to face the Government and Abdul Wahid. They therefore nominated Kashif-al-Ghata as their spokesman and gave their signatures to the demands which he prepared to press on the attention of the Government. These numbered twelve in all. The most important were free elections in one degree, proportionate representations of the Shiahs in the Chamber, the Cabinet and the civil service, more religious teaching in the schools, and the prohibition of prostitution and the sale of intoxicating liquors. The activities of the ulema provoked a strong Sunni reaction in Bagdad, and Abdul Wahid, who held fast to his political friends and refused to heed the threats of his spiritual masters, was hailed as a great leader and a pillar of national unity. Meetings were organised in his honour, and he and Sunni tribal chiefs from the north shook hands together on public platforms to symbolise their solidarity in the cause of the unity of the nation. The counter-move of the ulema was to extend their sectarian agitation southwards among the wild and warlike tribes of the Muntafiq Confederation. They were not everywhere successful, but a number of chieftains, especially those of the Suq-al-Shiyukh district, promised their support. Tortuous negotiations between the Government and the discontented Euphrates sheikhs continued throughout April and the Ministers employed every possible device to win their confidence. To prove their impartiality, the Government dissolved their political party, the Ikha-al-Watani, and the Prime Minister gave personal assurances that in the general election necessitated by the dissolution of Parliament on the 9 th April the anti-Abdul Wahid sheikhs'would be given as many seats as they had held in the previous Chamber. The Euphrates Rising. 119. At the beginning of May there were signs of improvement which strengthened hopes of a peaceful settlement, but these were soon dispelled. On the 7th May the Government arrested at Rumaitha a Shiah priest, named Ahmad Asaduliah, who, it was alleged, was actively inciting the tribes of the neigh bourhood to take up arms against the Government. 1 he same evening the local tribes revolted, tore up the railway line on both sides of the town and looted the station and the bazaar. The prompt measures taken by the Government to suppress this revolt, which soon spread to the Muntafiq Confederation, aie described in paragraphs 299 and 300 of this report. Within a month they had been completely successful, and throughout June the authority of the Government.ut'upp'ii.i iingm^. —rr——' ~ ^ ' ' 26 was steadily restored over the whole of the Nasariyah liwa. Fines of money and rifles were collected from the insurgent tribes and theii principal leadeis were brought to trial before the military courts, which were set up in the distuibed areas by Koyal iradah. Several summary executions were can ied out, and about 100 men were sentenced to terms of imprisonment varying from one to twenty years. These sentences were, however, soon remitted. In his Speech from the ^ Throne on the 8 th August, the King foreshadowed a general amnesty, and on the 8 th September, the occasion of the anniversary of the King s accession, a law was brought into effect pardoning all those who had risen against the Government in the Provinces of Piwaniyah, Diala and Muntafiq between the loth December, 1934, and the 2 nd June, 1935. This was a wise measure, following as it did a decisive assertion of the Government s authority, and it produced a good effect in the southern provinces. The pardon, which, under the same law, was extended to all those in the Kirkuk and Sulaimani liwas, who had rebelled against the Government between the 1st March, 1923, and the 15th August, 1935, was less appropriate. In this case the local authorities had been making unsuccessful endeavours to capture the persons concerned, and their pardon by the Government was an evidence of weakness rather than magnanimity. The Kadhimain Riot. 120. A serious riot occurred in Kadhimain on the 23rd March. A large mob severely damaged the structure of a partially finished new post office and then attacked the Government serai. One police inspector and one constable were killed, and the police were obliged to fire on the mob. The number of casualties which they caused is not known, but it was reported that three men were killed and about twenty persons of both sexes wounded or injured. The trouble was primarily due to the resentment aroused by the foolishness of the kaimakam, who, ignoring the religious sentiments of the people, permitted the new post office to be built on ground which was venerated as having been a cemetery for over 1,000 years. Nevertheless, there is little doubt that the displeasure of the people was exploited by Shiah agitators for political purposes. For a few days after the riot, the bazaars were closed and sullen crowds filled the streets; but there were no further clashes with the police, and when it was known that one of the British officials of the Iraqi Government had been put in charge of the preliminary investigations, normal conditions were rapidly restored. A number of arrests were made and sixteen persons were committed for trial by the court of sessions in June. Seven were found guilty and sentenced to twenty years’ imprisonment, the remaining nine were acquitted. During the trial fifteen witnesses were sentenced to one year’s imprisonment for perjury. On the 8 th September, the anniversary of the King’s accession, all those sentenced were released in accordance with a Royal iradah issued as a result of representations made to the King by influential Shiahs, who pleaded that those held responsible for the Kadhimain riots should not receive less lenient treatment than those convicted for taking up arms against the Government on the Euphrates. The General Election of 1935. 121. Orders setting in motion the machinery of the general elections were issued on the 9th June and the final polling took place on the 3rd August. During the preparation of the registers the department which had been conducting a new census as a preliminary to the application of the National Service Law was able to report a notable increase in the population of the country. The Constitu tion provides for the election of one Deputy for every 20,000 adult males. In all previous elections eighty-eight Deputies had been returned to the Chamber, the seats being allotted to each province on the basis of an estimate of the population made by the administrative officials for this purpose. In this election the number of seats allotted was increased by twenty to 108. The Census Department has not yet published the results of its work, but this increase of seats, if it was made with arithmetical accuracy, indicates an increase of 400,000 male adults in the population of the country. It was, however, suggested in many well-informed quarters that the Government had designedly increased the number of Deputies in order that they might be able to reward their supporters without excluding others whose position in tribal or public life made their presence in the Chamber desirable. Everywhere, according to custom, the candidates27 [12931] B 14 nominated by the Cabinet were returned, and in most instances suitable men seem to have been chosen. Sixty-eight of those elected had had previous parliamentary experience. The Extraordinary Session of Parliament. 122. In fulfilment of the provisions of the Constitution, which stipulates that Parliament must meet not later than four months after a dissolution, King Ghazi opened an extraordinary session on the 8 th August. A month later, all urgent business having been transacted, the session was adjourned for forty-five days. On the 2fith October sittings were resumed, but only five days remained before the close of the session and the only measure of importance passed was the Bill authorising the Government to take the necessary steps to give effect to the recommendations of the League of Nations for sanctions against Italy. The principal laws passed by the Chamber during the extraordinary session were :— (a) Second Amendment Law to the Customs Tariff Law of 1935. (b) Law for the provision of a loan for the Bagdad and other municipalities. (c) Law supplemental to the Civil Pensions Law. (d) General Amnesty Law. The Autumn Session of 1935. 123. The next ordinary session of 1935-36 began on the 2nd November. The Speech from the Throne opened with a reference to foreign relations and to the progress which had been made at Geneva towards a settlement of outstanding differences with Iran. This was followed by an appreciative mention of the negotiations for the final transfer to the Iraqi Government of the Iraq railway- system and of the happy influence which this event had had on Anglo-Iraqi relations. His Majesty also spoke of the war in Abyssinia and the steps taken by his Government to carry out their obligations under the Covenant of the League of Nations The speech concluded with a short catalogue of the more important Bills to be laid before Parliament during the session. Among these were a new Penal Code, a new Electoral Law and a law to Restrict Certain Occupations to Iraqis. 124. The last of these three was introduced early in the session and became the subject of energetic representations by His Majesty’s Ambassador, which are recorded in section I of this report. 125 Two private members’ resolutions, one urging the Government to make it a criminal offence to break the Ramadhan fast and the other recommending the limitation by law of the amount of marriage dowries in order to make mariiage easier and thereby increase the birth rate, aroused keen interest and hot debates. Conscription. 126 Iraqi politicians of all shades of opinion have long wished to change the system of recruiting for the army. They have inherited continental ideas on this subject through the Turks and believe that conscripts are better fighters than professional soldiers, whom they stigmatise as mercenaries. 1 hey also favour a system of compulsory military service because they believe that it will strengthen national unity among the diverse peoples of Iraq and will enable the Government to organise a much larger army without seriously increasing the cost of maintenance. On the other hand, most of the Government s British advisers have been inclined to prefer a small professional, highly trained and mobile army, on the ground that the application of conscription to the tribes would be likely to lead to disorders which would seriously disturb the tranquillity of the country, whilst the fighting value of poorly trained conscript troops would be very doubtful. Until 1932 the Iraqi Government reluctantly gave way to British views, but soon after Iraq’s admission to membership of the League of Nations as an independent State, it became clear that the Government were eager to introduce some form of compulsory service. A National Service Law was actually passed early in 1934, but could not be put into foice until a new census had been completed. This done, no time was lost m making the lawmtw~ mm m 28 operative, and the necessary Royal iradah was issued with effect from the 12th June, 1935. This event was followed by demonstrations of enthusiasm in all the chief towns and the people of each quarter of Bagdad organised a procession to the Ministry of Defence to declare theii gratitude to the Govein- ment for having given them the opportunity to serve in the army. 1 here was more than a suspicion, however, that this enthusiasm was not altogether spontaneous, and it was noticeable that few of the demonstrators were of an age to be liable for colour service. 127. The Government did not ignore the possibility of tribal resistance to compulsory military service, and their plans included special ai langements for calling up, through the sheikhs, small quotas of recruits fiom difficult tiibal areas. &amp; Nevertheless, they soon met with difficulties. At Qurna, in August, the efforts of the local recruiting committee to register the men liable for service were forcibly resisted and the local kaimakam was attacked by tribesmen. By taking prompt military action the Government compelled the insurgent tribal elements to submit, and the disorder did not spread. 128. Attempts to register potential conscripts again met with armed opposition in late September, this time from the Yezidis in the Sinjar mountains (see paragraphs 152 and 153 below). Education 129. No action was taken on the report made by Mr. Nowell Smith in 1934 on the scheme for establishing a secondary school on English public school lines. On the other hand, Mr. Wheldon, of the Board of Education, was engaged to take charge of technical education in Iraq. He paid a short visit to Bagdad in the summer of 1935, but did not return to take up his permanent appointment till the first week in 1936. 130. Three new English teachers arrived from the United Kingdom in November, and were posted to the secondary schools in Mosul and Bagdad and to the Bagdad Teachers’ Training College. 131. In the summer Taha Pasha Al Hashimi, the Chief of General Staff, was given temporarily the additional appointment of Acting Director-General in the Ministry of Education, which was said to be badly in need of reorganisation. A regulation which the Government issued in November may have been the result of this appointment. It provided (a) for the organisation of a semi-military summer camp in the north of Iraq for elder school boys, at which attendance was to be free and voluntary and open to boys from private schools; and (b) for arrangements to be made in all garrison towns for elementary military instruction, practical and theoretical, to be given in the senior classes of the Iraqi schools. 132. In November, Sati Beg Al Hisri, the Director-General of Training and Instruction in the Ministry of Education, visited Egypt to study Egyptian educational methods. He returned with many new ideas and a principal and four professors for the law school. It is hoped that they will raise the standard of teaching and broaden the curriculum of the school, which, apart from the medical college, is the only centre of higher education in the country, and through which all aspirants for appointment to any of the higher posts in the civil service must pass. Justice. 133. Soon after Yassin Pasha’s Government had taken office in March 1935 they decided to appoint Mr. Drower to be president of the Court of Appeal vice Mr. Alexander, and to ask His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to find a suitable jurist to replace Mr. Drower as adviser to the Ministry of Justice. In September, however, His Majesty’s Government were obliged to inform the Iraqi Government that they had been unable to find a suitable candidate for this post. Shortly afterwards Mr. Drower was reinstated as adviser, and Mr. Alexander, on his return from leave, reverted to the Court of Appeal as acting president. 134. The contracts of four of the nine British jurists were renewed during the year. One junior judge left the country and had not been replaced before theend of the year. A second junior judge resigned his appointment, but his resignation will not take effect till the spring of 1936. Propaganda. 135. The regulations for the reorganisation of the Ministry of the Interior, which were issued in June, created a new Department of Publicity and Propaganda. The duties of the director of this Department were defined as being: “To supervise the grant of permits to newspapers, magazines and printing presses; to see that the Press and Printing Law is acted upon; to examine books, newspapers and magazines entering Iraq from abroad, also all books printed in Iraq; to publish the Official Gazette-, to supply the newspapers with necessary information, and to undertake the issue of a monthly review dealing with Iraq’s scientific, cultural, moral and economic affairs; to establish an agency for telegraphic news; to organise the lectures in schools and clubs, with a view to strengthening national feeling, improving morals and knowledge of literature; also lectures on economic, social and historical subjects, and to broad cast by wireless information regarding such of the foregoing subjects as may be useful, and to endeavour to encourage propaganda on behalf of Iraq abroad.” 136. The Department has not yet undertaken all the duties assigned to it. No monthly review has been published, no propaganda abroad has been organised, and broadcasting from Bagdad has yet to begin. In short, in spite of its new high-sounding title, the Department has changed little since the time when it was still called the Press Bureau. 137. The new Department has no separate budget provision, and its expenditure is debited to the budget of the Ministry of the Interior. The Kurds. Barzan. 138. Throughout the winter months the Barzan area continued to be harassed by the bands of the rebel outlaw Khalil Khoshawi, and effective counter- measures were rendered impossible by the heavy snow which covers all the passes at this time of year. Towards the end of March, however, the Iraqi Government succeeded in rousing the Turkish authorities to more vigorous action. Three hundred Turkish infantry were sent to the frontier near Barokh, and on the Iraqi side a mobile force of 500 police and two frontier battalions of the Iraqi army were concentrated in the Barzan and Baradost areas. A number of small engagements took place, in which Khalil Khoshawi probably lost some twenty to thirty men killed and wounded. He was further weakened by the desertion of many men who surrendered to the local authorities on easy terms. In April, being denied escape to his habitual hiding-places on the Turkish side of the border, he fled to the mountain ranges near Dalamber Dach, where the Turkish, Iranian and Iraqi frontiers meet. For a while he remained in hiding, but in late June he was once more raiding and pillaging villages in Iraq. The Iraqi Government again strengthened their forces, and the Turkish Government reinforced their frontier troops with two battalions of infantry and 200 cavalry sabres. Martial law was proclaimed in the disturbed area, and a number of villages, from which Khalil Khoshawi and his bands were accustomed to obtain food and fodder, were evacuated by their inhabitants under the orders of the officer in command of the Iraqi troops. The concerted operations of the Turkish and Iraqi troops were to a large degree successful. Denied supplies, Khalil Khoshawi’s following was very soon reduced to about twenty harassed and exhausted men. At the beginning of September he was reported to have fled to Iran, and during the last week of October the reign of martial law was terminated. Some sixty-three of Khalil Khoshawi’s followers were tried by the military courts and sentenced to varying terms of imprisonment, and eight were hanged. 139. Unfortunately, as soon as winter forced the withdrawal of the special Turkish and Iraqi forces which had been concentrated against him, Khalil Khoshawi returned to his old haunt, the Govanda plateau, and about the middle of November he was again harassing the north of the Barosh and Baradost districts.30 140. The tribesmen and villagers of the whole of the Barzan area have now been reduced to great poverty and want. The depredations of Khalil Khoshawi have interrupted their agricultural and pastoral routine, and the presence in their country for several months of large bodies of troops and police has denuded it of supplies. During the winter of 1935-36, those who remain—for many have fled elsewhere—will be in a sorry plight. Sulaimani. 141. The outlaw Saiyid Muhammad Pichkole, with several subordinate associates of the same type, surrendered in August. After having been detained for some time in Bagdad, they were pardoned and permitted to return to their villages. Since then, security in the Sulaimani liwa has much improved, and no serious banditry has occurred. Kurdish Nationalism. 142. The organisers of the political campaign against Ali Jaudat Beg’s Cabinet, which was conducted from Bagdad in the spring, did not overlook the possibility of creating embarrassments for the Government in the southern Kurdish areas. By means of suitable intermediaries, an agitation was worked up on familiar lines. Petitions presenting demands for better Kurdish schools and more Kurdish officials were circulated among the tribal leaders and influential townsmen, and a large number of signatures were obtained. Arrangements were then made for deputations from all parts of Kurdistan to visit Bagdad to press these demands on the attention of the authorities. The time programme did not, however, work out as intended, and the deputations of representative Kurds, which had been brought to Bagdad to harass Ali Jaudat and his colleagues, arrived there shortly after Yassin Pasha's Cabinet had taken office. The Prime Minister and the Minister of the Interior adroitly exploited this inopportune event to their advantage by giving out that the deputation had come to assure the Government of the whole-hearted support of the Sunnis of the north against the Shiah disturbers of the peace in the south. At the same time lavish promises were freely made and, after the deputations had been liberally entertained at the expense of secret service funds, they returned to their homes well pleased with their happy holiday in Bagdad. 143. In the autumn, reports of new efforts to revive the Kurdish Nationalist movement were current, but nothing came of them, and at the end of the year the Kurdish areas were free from any political or racial movements of importance. The Assyrians. 144. The fears aroused by the reports received from Brigadier-General Browne at the end of the year 1934, that a suitable territory for Assyrian settle ment would not be found in British Guiana, were confirmed early in 1935 by his final report to the Committee of the Council. At the special session held in April, the rapporteur informed the Council that the Committee for the Settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq had been forced to decide wuth regret that the Guiana scheme was impracticable, and that they had therefore reverted to the idea of further settlement of the Assyrians in French mandated territory in the Levant. He added that, subject to the reservation that an official assurance was given that no burden would be placed on the French budget or on the budgets of the mandated States, the French Government had agreed, in principle, to this proposal. The rapporteur further reported that the French and Iraqi Governments had invited the chairman of the Committee (M. Lopez Oilivan) to visit Syria and Iraq to study the matter in detail on the spot. He proposed that the Council should approve of this invitation being accepted. The rapporteur’s recommendations were unanimously adopted, and on the 6 th May, with the assent of the Iraqi Government, M. Olivan, accompanied by M. Arocha from the League Secretariat, arrived in Beirut. After preliminary discussions with the French High Commissioner and with Nuri Pasha (who was in Beirut on his way to Geneva to attend the May session of the Council of the League of Nations), M. Olivan came to Bagdad, where he arrived on the 11 th May. Shortly afterwards he visited Mosul, where he made a tour of the Assyrian villages. His purpose was to estimate how many Assyrians would wish to go to one of the Levant Statesunder French mandate if their resettlement there could be arranged. His conclusion was that nearly all of them would leave Iraq if they were offered the opportunity to do so. 145. On his return to Bagdad on the 22nd May, he discussed with Yassin Pasha the sum which the Iraqi Government would contribute towards the cost of the scheme. He explained that the French authorities in Syria had under consideration two alternative plans. One was to settle the Assyrians on the Orontes valley to the east of the Jebel Ansariyah in the Alaouite State, and the other was to establish them in somewhat scattered groups on the upper and middle reaches of the Khabur River in Syria, Either plan, it was estimated, would involve the committee in an expenditure of about 60 million francs. He said that, in order to arrange for settlement to begin, he must be assured of a minimum capital of £250,000. 'if the Iraqi Government would offer that sum, he would return to Beirut and organise the earliest possible transfer of all ex-Ottoman Assyrians who wished to leave Iraq. The discussions lasted for several days, but M. Olivan did not obtain all the money for which he asked. The final offer of the Iraqi Government was £10 a head for every Assyrian emigrant up to a maximum of £125,000, with an initial payment of £60,000 on account to be made at the time of the departure of the first contingent of 4,000 or 5,000 persons. M. Olivan then returned to Geneva via Beirut, where he had further discussions with the French High Commissioner. 146. The Assyrians were somewhat disappointed that before leaving Iraq he had not made a statement regarding their future, and those in Mosul town showed signs of dangerous restlessness. M. Olivan was informed of the situation, and as a palliative measure he arranged for the immediate transfer to Syria of the 340 inmates of the camp for destitutes and of 1,050 mdigents from Mosul town. These were all successfully transferred before the close of the first fortnight of July. Most of them were well-dressed and well-nourished, and showed little sign of the hardships which they were supposed to have suffered durino- the preceding year. The Iraqi Government assisted this movement by putting at the immediate disposal of the Council Committee a credit of £60,000. 147. M. Olivan’s committee next met at Geneva about the middle of July to consider the results of their president’s visit to Syria and Iraq On bis recommendation it was decided to work for the realisation of the scheme oi settlement in the Ghab area on the Orontes, and arrangements were made with the French Government for two experts from the League to visit the Gliab and to work out details in collaboration with the local authorities. It was also decided to make an appeal to the Iraqi -Government to double the contribution of £125,000 which they had already promised and also to renew the appeal made by the Council in January 1934 to all States members of the League to participate in financing the resettlement of the Assyrians. In addition, the president o the committee, in his own name and in that of all the members of the committee, except that of the United Kingdom s representative, addressed a letter to FIis Maiesty’s Government in the United Kingdom asking them to reconsider their previous decision to make a payment only as part of a general League conti ibution. 148. As the result of this appeal His Majesty’s Government came to the conclusion that, while they must adhere to their original view regarding the collective responsibility of the League for financing the Assyrian settlement, it was desirable on practical grounds to reconsider their attitude towards an independent contribution. They were of the opinion, however, that, apait tiom other necessary conditions, it would be impossible to obtain the consent of Parliament to a contribution greater than that which might be made by Iraq. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires in Bagdad was instructed to inform the Iraqi Government of this conclusion and at the same time to point out that the contribution of £125,000 already promised by the Iraqi Government and a similar contribution from His Majesty’s Government would not suffice to ensure the financial success of the scheme. He was accordingly to employ every means o persuading the Iraqi Government to increase their contribution. Mr. Bateman found, however, that the Iraqi Government were most reluctant to reconsidei their original undertaking, and on more than one occasion the Prime Minister rejected in the firmest manner the suggestion that they should double then contri bution. Meanwhile, the French High Commission at Beirut, m conjunctionwith the two representatives of the League, had worked out estimates showing the total cost of the Ghab scheme to be in the neighbourhood of 70 million francs apart from a contribution of about 22 million already promised by the State of Latakia. Informal negotiations followed between the French and British Governments, and several expedients were examined with a view to reducing the amount which it would be necessary for the Assyrian Committee to find. The outcome was the reduction to about 86 million francs of the estimated cost of the Ghab scheme and the offer of an additional 6,500,000 fr. from the authorities of the mandated territories towards the cost of the necessary drainage and irrigation works. 149. The whole question was then again most carefully reviewed by His Majesty’s Government, and on the 10 th September the United 'Kingdom represen tative was authorised to inform the Assyrian Committee that, subject to the elaboration of a satisfactory scheme of settlement, and provided that there was a reasonable prospect that the funds forthcoming from other sources, including the League, when combined with an independent contribution from the United Kingdom, would be sufficient to ensure the success of such a scheme, His Majestv’s Government would be prepared to recommend Parliament to authorise an indepen dent contribution of five-twelfths of the expense of the scheme subject to the proviso that such contribution should not exceed £250,000 and that the Iraqi Government should contribute a like amount. This statement was duly reported to the Council, who, on the 13th September, unanimously resolved to refer it to the Assembly with the expressed hope that the latter would be able to find the remaining funds necessary. 150. In the meantime His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Bagdad had brought strong pressure to bear on the Iraqi Government and had succeeded in persuading them to send instructions to Nuri Pasha at Geneva, which enabled him to inform the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, in a note dated the 26th September, that the Iraqi Government would seek parliamentary sanction to raise, 'pari passu with the United Kingdom contribution, the contribution which they had already promised towards the proposed scheme of Assyrian settlement, subject to a maximum payment of £250,000. On the same'day the Fourth Committee of the Assembly took note of this offer and of the conditional offer of His Majesty s Government, and sanctioned, as a special measure, a grant from eague fupds of 1,300,000 Swiss francs (about £ 86 , 000 ), to be spread over a period of five years. At the close of the year the financial position of the Ghab scheme was roughly as follows :— Total cost of the scheme lotal contributions already in sight Million French francs. 86 72-5 Money still to be found ... 13-5 The Yazidis.33 the more important leaders went to the mutessarif at Mosul and pleaded for special concessions to be made to the Yazidis in view of the peculiar tenets of their faith, which made it difficult for them to serve in the ordinary units of the Iraqi army. They suggested that the formation of a Yazidi company, to be commanded by Christian officers, would provide a possible solution. Their representations were not, however, kindly received by the Government. All concessions were refused, and orders were given for the normal registration procedure to be carried out in the Sin jar. Some tribesmen submitted, but others fled from their villages and gathered in armed bands in mountain caves. Their principal leader was a chieftain named Daud-i-Daud, a man with a stormy past. The Government took strong action and concentrated a mixed brigade to deal with the disaffected Yazidis. The tribesmen made some resistance at first, but were eventually overwhelmed, losing upwards of 300 men killed and wounded. Martial law was then proclaimed, and the military court set up in the Sin jar dealt severely with those brought before it. Nine were hanged and 328 were sentenced to terms of imprisonment varying from life to one year. Among those hanged were two Christian notables of Mosul. There seems to have been little evidence against them, except that they Were alleged to have been in touch with the insurgents. The death sentence was summarily executed, and orders which had been given that death sentences were to be confirmed by the Cabinet were either ignored or did not reach the officer commanding the area placed under martial law. Some twenty other quite innocent Christians of Mosul were also arrested on suspicion of complicity in the insurrection, but as a result of representations by His Majesty’s Embassy they were released after a few days’ detention. 153. It cannot be denied that the Yazidis were at fault in taking up arms against the Government, but it is difficult to avoid the impression that the rising was suppressed with undue severity and punished with quite unnecessary harshness. The two Christians who were hanged appear to have been bad characters, but their condemnation on insufficient evidence was little short of judicial murder. It caused a panic among the Christians of Mosul, and the tenseness of the atmosphere was further increased when a detachment of police, who were entering Mosul on their return from the Sin jar, fired a volley into the air. But, in response to representations made by His Majesty’s Ambassador, the Iraqi Government forbade any form of demonstration by the army on its return to Mosul, and during the following weeks the civil authorities gradually regained complete control of the situation. The Jews. 154. The bogey of Zionism continues to haunt the Iraqi Government, and the authorities are apt to take hasty and ill-considered action whenever they suspect anyone of spreading Zionist propaganda. 155. In January two teachers of the Shamash Jewish Boys’ School in Bagdad were suddenly arrested and summarily deported to Palestine in a most inconsiderate and unnecessarily harsh manner. It was alleged that they had both been active workers for the Zionist cause, and deportation orders were issued on the ground that they were undesirable characters. One of the two men was a Palestinian national and, at the instance of the Government of Palestine, representations were made on his behalf by His Majesty’s Embassy. No satisfactory reply had, however, been received from the Iraqi Government before the close of the year. 156. Other minor instances of the intolerant attitude of the authorities towards those connected with Zionism were the petty persecution in January of the semi-official representative in Bagdad of the Zionist Agency and a clumsy and altogether unjustified attempt to deport Mr. Ben Zvi, the executive chairman of the General Council of the Jewish Community of Palestine, who was visiting Bagdad in July. His Majesty’s Embassy were unable to intervene effectively on behalf of the representative of the Zionist Agency as he was an Iraqi national, but Mr. Zvi, being a Palestinian, was successfully protected from the clumsy stupidity of the Bagdad police.34 157 The relations between the Jewish community and the Arabs remain normal, but are always liable to be disturbed by the slightest signs of Zionist activity m Iracj. Arab grievances m Talestme aie also cgiiclvly taken up m this country, and local anger at the supposed wrongs of the Palestinian Arabs is apt to be vented on the Iraqi Jews. III. —Internal Affairs (Economic). Budget Estimates for 1935-36. 158. Owing to the troubles in Southern Iraq in the spring of 1935, which caused a change^ of Government and then claimed all the energies of the new Administration, no general budget was passed for 1935-36. The various Govern ment departments were accordingly authorised to spend monthly one-twelfth of the sum allotted to them in the previous budget and, so far as as is known, this arrangement has worked successfully. 159. A Budget Law to cover the year 1935-36 was introduced on the 30th December, and was under discussion until the 22nd January. Details have not yet been made public. Actual Receipts and Expenditure for the Year 1934-35. 160. The budget estimates for the financial year ending the 31st March, 1935, had provided for a small surplus, but the surplus actually realised was much more substantial than had been expected. Ordinary receipts amounted to 4,000,940 dinars, and expenditure to 3,735,374 dinars, leaving a credit balance of 265,566 dinars. This was largely due to an increase over the estimated revenue of 182,133 dinars, and in part to an under-spending of 77,823 dinars. The sums received from the British Oil Development Company, including the outstanding payment due in the previous financial year, were credited to the capital works account, and the successful result of the financial activities of the Government did not derive from abnormal receipts from oil resources. The improvement in the revenues was due to considerably enlarged receipts from customs and excise duties and from the tax on agricultural and natural produce and animals, and reflects a definite improvement in the agricultural and commercial situation in Iraq. 161. No change in the methods of collection of taxes was introduced in the period under review, nor were any major alterations in the customs tariff or excise duties made. The more favourable results of the financial year 1934-35 are therefore strictly comparable with those of the preceding year. A comparative table of the final results for the two years is given below :— Chapter I Taxation on agricultural and natural produce, animals and rents of Government properties Receipts, 1934.

The unexpended balance of the capital works account on the le 31st March, 1934, was 991,389 dinars. During the following financial year flS receipts amounted to 1,008,428 dinars, of which rather less than half was spent. !g The position on the 31st March, 1935, was therefore as follows — fit Dinars.

The foregoing tables show almost in its entirety the financial position of Iraq at the end of the financial year 1934-35 and, by combining certain items extracted from them, the following statement of the national finances can be arrived at:— Dinars. Deficit on normal estimates, March 31, 1934 438,895 Surplus on normal estimates, March 31, 1935 ... . 265,566 Net deficit, March 31, 1935 ... 173,329 Receipts from capital sources to March 31, 1935... 2,833,146 Expenditure on capital works to March 31, 1935... 1,370,221 Surplus on capital account ... 1,462,926 Net surplus on both accounts 1,289,597 Railway loans to be charged off 343,875 Net surplus on all accounts ... 945,722 Appreciation of the Financial Situation in Iraq on December 31, 1935. 164. The preceding account refers to the period which ended on the 31st March, 1935. The situation at that date was eminently satisfactory and— Ml 36 encouraging. By the end of the calendar year it was evident that the improvement in the ordinary revenues had continued and the monthly receipts were considerably higher than in the preceding year. The Government departments appeared to be functioning properly, and most of them had no difficulty in continuing their work on allotments of the same sums as in the preceding year. The accounts of Ministry of Defence and the Iraq police disclosed considerably increased expenditure. This ^ was mainly due to the military operations on the Euphrates and in the Sinjar. The increasing expansion of the armed forces and the introduction of conscription, however, introduce new permanent factors into the cost of the Ministry of Defence which seem likely to make it more difficult to balance the budget with ordinary receipts only. 165. On the 31st October, 1935, the ordinary accounts stood as follows Dinars. Ordinary revenue ... ... ... 2,508.994 Ordinary expenditure ... ... ... 2,274,917 Surplus ... ... ... 234,077 166. Expenditure from the capital account was much greater than in the preceding year in view of the construction of the Kut Barrage. The total expended in 1935 up to the end of October was 581,584 dinars. National Currency. 167. The currency in circulation in the country continued its upward trend, as will be seen from the following table :— Total coins Total notes Total currency ... November 30, 193 A. November 30, 1935. £ 590,050 2,839,315 3,429,365 £ 614,085 3,180,235 3,794,320 The Iraq Currency Board reported favourably on the operations undertaken in the year ending the 31st March, 1935, and continued the practice of con tributing from its profits to Iraq Government revenues and an increased payment of 15,000 dinars was made by the board. Government Banks. 168. The Bill for the establishment of an Agricultural and Industrial Bank became law in September 1935. Its purpose is to provide cheap credit for agriculturalists and for new industrial ventures. To take effect the law has to be implemented by regulations which so far have not been elaborated. The Govern ment was hoping to obtain the assistance of the local British banks in carrying the projected law into effect, but the suggestion that these should take up £ 100,000 worth of 4 per cent, stock has not been received with any great enthusiasm. 169. A law creating a Post Office Savings Bank, under which deposits would be guaranteed by the Government, was passed in October. The necessary machinery to give effect to the provisions of this measure had not been set up by the end of 1935. Iraq Railways. 170. The year’s working of the Iraq railways was satisfactory, and closed with a revenue surplus twice as great as in the year 1933-34 :— . Dinars. Revenue ... ... ... ... ... 572,107 Expenditure ... ... ... ... 512.715 Surplus ... ... ... 59,392 This favourable result was in the main due to the unusually large shipments of grain, chiefly barley, which followed upon the crop failures in Roumania.171. The outbreak of troubles on the Lower Euphrates in April 1935 had a serious effect on the railways. The line was broken for nearly three weeks. Instead of a surplus of receipts over expenditure, deficits were recorded over a period of six months (April to August). In the succeeding monthly accounts a favourable balance again appeared, and by the end of November the deficit, which stood at over £23,000 at the beginning of September, had been converted into a surplus of £10,000. It is improbable that the year 1935-36 will be as successful as the preceding period, but the results now show promise of being far from unsatisfactory. 172. The position of the railways follows :— at the end of November 1935 was as Dinars.

Port of Basra. 173. The year 1934-35 was a very successful one for the port from every point of view. A very substantial surplus was recorded at the close of the year. Oil tanker shipping was only slightly greater than in the previous year, but other ocean-going traffic showed a considerable increase owing to an unusually large volume of exports of dates and grain, which more than made up for a slight decrease in imports. 174. After the twelfth instalment of the capital debt and interest charges due to His Majesty’s Government had been paid and provision made for depreciation the revenue surplus was £34,480 (against the estimate of £2,310). The reserves, which on the 31st March, 1935, totalled £358,384, consist largely of new capital works on which £220,049 has been spent, but the financial position is very strong and there is no reason to think that the long series of revenue surpluses will be interrupted in the near future. 175. Considerable progress was made towards the completion of the all- weather landing field of the new port aerodrome, which, in the latter months of 1935, was being used by commercial aircraft. In addition to the central power house which supplies electric current to the town, the port assumed control of the municipal water supply during 1935 on the completion of its chlorination plant. On the other hand, the maintenance of the leisian Gulf Lighting and Buoying Service was transferred to the Iranian Government. 176 Nine hundred and thirty-one ships entered the port area during the year 1934-35, an increase of forty-nine vessels as compared with the previous year. Of these 733 went to Mohammerah or Abadan and 197 to Basra. Fao Bar Dredging Service. 177. This service was confronted with a particularly hard year’s work as a result of a second season of unusually heavy silting m the dredged channels, and of the abnormal dust storms which led to a loss of nearly 400 hours dredging time. In spite of these adverse conditions, the depth of water m the dredged channel was maintained at 23 feet, but this was only achieved with considerable difficulty until the arrival in May of a third dredger which had been ordered from the United Kingdom in 1934. 178. In April 1934 the dredging dues were reduced by 25 per cent. Although the number of vessels using the channel rose shghtly, there was necessarily a decrease in the amount received m dues amounting to £65,607. Total revenue amounted to £240,138, and expenditure, including paymen o^38 the new dredger (£115,000), was £242,377. But the reserve fund stood at £145,331, so that the financial position was entirely satisfactory. On the 31st December, when introducing the budget for 1935-36, the Prime Minister announced a further reduction of 15 per cent, in the dredging dues. He stated that this reduction had been made in pursuance of the Government’s poliev, adopted as from the 1st April, 1935, whereby dredging dues to be levied from shipping passing through the Rookah Channel in transit should not be in excess of those admissible by international practice provided that the amount therebv collected should be not less than the necessary expenditure on the maintenance and improvement of the channel and its approaches to a depth and breadth adequate for the bulk of shipping making use of it. 179. Since the customs returns for the last calendar year are never ready in time for a report written in January, it would seem more satisfactory to adhere to the practice adopted in last year’s report of dealing with the trade statistics of Iraq in completed financial years. Below are the comparative figures for the foreign trade of Iraq during the past three financial years :— 180. The total imports were slightly higher (by £80,000) than in the previous year. In view of the fact that there was a diminution in the imports of material for the Iraq Petroleum Company and an increasing resort to Japan as a supplier of cheap merchandise, this result indicates that the actual volume of consumers’ goods imported into Iraq was probably very much greater than in any previous year. The decline in imports from the United Kingdom is a disappointing feature of the figures. These decreased by £485,000, which is almost exactly balanced by an increase in Japanese imports by £518,000. Directly attributable to Japanese competition is the grave fall in the imports of United Kingdom cotton piece-goods by £207,000. The balance of the lost trade may be ascribed in part to competition in a variety of other lines, and in part to the completion of the Iraq Petroleum Company pipe-line and related works, with a consequent slackening in the importation of pipes and other equipment from the United Kingdom. The total of United Kingdom imports does not compare unfavourably with those of 1930-31 and 1931-32, which were post-depression but pre-Iraq Petroleum Company years. 181. The gross imports of cotton piece-goods were valued at 880,000 dinars, but the United Kingdom share was only 94,000 dinars, as compared with 301,000 dinars in 1933-34. Japanese goods were frequently, bulk for bulk, 30 per cent, cheaper than those of their displaced rivals, and Iraq supplied herself with her requirements of cotton textiles at a saving of £60,000 over the previous year. In woollen piece-goods, however, the United Kingdom improved her position, remaining the principal supplier with an increased total of £ 86 , 000 . Owing to a reclassification of items in the customs schedule, it is not possible to provide comparative figures covering the important classes of imports entered under iron and steel and their manufactures and machinery. Competition between the United Kingdom, Belgium and Germany was very keen, and it would appear that, thanks to subsidies to the export industries, the Germans made some IV.— Trade and Commerce.

The United States continued to be the main supplier of motor vehicles, although the total purchases of these declined in value by some £40,000. New registrations in the two years show that the decline was chiefly in commercial vehicles, and this again may be an indirect result of the completion of the Iraq Petroleum Company's pipe-line. Exports of motor vehicles from the United Kingdom fell from 38,000 to 19,000 dinars in 1934-35. The United Kingdom sold to Iraq an increased value of aircraft, and maintained its position as the principal supplier of liquors, provisions and paints. 182. The export trade of Iraq, in the year 1934—35, was exceptionally good, and amounted to 4,785,000 dinars as against 2,874,000 dinars in the previous financial year. The new item, oil exports, accounted for 824,000 dinars of the increase, but the balance was due to very favourable shipments of agricultural produce and live-stock. In particular, the sales of barley were extremely good, and their value reached 694,000 dinars as against 207,000 dinars in the previous year. Dates remained the largest single item of export at the increased figure of 926,000 dinars. The wool clip showed an improvement, while the export of sheep to Palestine and Egypt was above average, and substantially better than in the two recent abnormally dry years. In the group hides, skins, and intestines, a slight retrogression was recorded. The cultivation of cotton revived somewhat, and, at 27,000 dinars, exceeded in value the longer established products, liquorice and gall nuts, sales of which were average. 183. The export of poultry, fish and eggs to Palestine continued to be a small but profitable business which is capable of further development. 184. In the year under review there was a net export of treasure to the value of 773,000 dinars included in the total of exports. This figure is greater than in the preceding year, but it is to be expected that hoarded Turkish gold liras and smuggled Persian silver rials will not much longer be forthcoming to nourish this trade. 185. The United Kingdom remained Iraq’s best customer, having purchased produce to the value of 1,504,000 dinars as against 901,000 dinars in 1933-34. Date shipments to the United Kingdom increased from 113,000 to 138,000 dinars, and barley shipments reached a record total of 544,000 dinars. 186. Exports to India were appreciably higher at 406,000 dinars, of which total dates accounted for 240,000 dinars. Exports to Syria also showed a large increase, while the oil consigned to France (valued at 531,000 dinars) formed the preponderant part of her total purchases of 646,000 dinars, and enabled her to rank as Iraq’s second best customer. 187. Transit trade was as satisfactory as can be expected in view of the policy of the Iranian Government to discourage the use of the Khanaqin- Kermanshah road and to develop the Persian Gulf routes. The withdrawal of Iraqi merchants from Iran continued and the financial centre of the import trade into Iran changed from Bagdad to Mohammerah. The actual total of transit trade was fairly well maintained thanks to the carriage by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company of large quantities of their products to Northern Iran by the Khanaqin route (and, to a small extent, by the Rowanduz route). The following table shows the fluctuation in transit trade during the past three years Carpets still form the most valuable item of transit trade, followed by oils, cotton piece-goods and motor vehicles.

This will adversely affect transit trade figures and the traffic on the Rowanduz route, already slight, will almost completely disappear. 188. The development of a direct pilgrim route from Iraq to Mecca via Najaf, Hail and Medina does not appear likely to influence trade relations. General. 189. There was, as has been usual since the war, an apparent adverse balance in the total of the foreign trade of Iraq, which amounted to 1,320,000 dinars. Amongst other less ascertainable “ invisible ” exports in 1934-35 were the sums received by the Iraq Government on account of rent and royalties from the oil companies, which alone amounted to 928,000 dinars. In addition to this, money spent in Iraq by the oil companies in the course of their operations, by His Majesty’s Government on the British forces garrisoned in the country, by foreign diplomatic missions, and by pilgrims and tourists, as well as the profits of Iraqi merchants and transporters from the entrepot trade, must be credited to the export side of the foreign trade accounts as invisible items which, it may be assumed, more than cover the remaining adverse balance. It is reasonable to assume from the fact that there is no evidence over a period of years of any financial disequilibrium or of any recourse to foreign loans that the apparent adverse trade balance is, in fact, a favourable one. The general external trade position of Iraq is certainly satisfactory and the prospects of a steady expansion of commercial activity are good. 190. The drain of capital from Iraq to Palestine mentioned in last year’s report undoubtedly slackened during 1935, and it is clear that it is not likely to harm the development of Iraq. There has been adequate money available for commercial transactions and a fall in interest rates. Building activity has been maintained at a high level, but very little surplus capital has found its way into industrial enterprises. Considerable enthusiasm has been shown for the opening of cigarette factories, which do not call for very much capital, and their number rose to nine in Bagdad and two in the provinces, with a daily output capacity of 10 million cigarettes. 191. It might, perhaps, be appropriate to mention here various schemes which have been suggested or initiated in the past year for the improvement of certain Iraqi products. 192. An ambitious proposal for the dipping of sheep was sponsored by the Prime Minister in May and experimental dips for about 100,000 sheep were established in different parts of the country. A United Kingdom firm is following closely the development of this scheme in the hope of securing further orders for the necessary disinfectants. A further proposal was made for the establishment of stations for washing the clipped wool before export in order to secure better prices. The Mosul Chamber of Commerce and the leading wool dealers in all parts of the country strenuously opposed the proposal on the grounds that they would not recoup the expense involved by a somewhat problematic improvement in the price offered in Marseilles or Liverpool. 193. In the spring of 1935 the date palms in a large number of gardens above Basra were attacked by a severe pest which threatened seriously to affect the prospects of the crop. Combative measures were taken by the Department of Agriculture and the effects of the pest were circumscribed. There was some talk of granting a date monopoly, but the Association of Date Growers and Packers was resolutely against any such plan and the proposal was dropped. 194. Towards the end of the year arrangements were made for a tobacco expert, lent by the British American Tobacco Company, to visit Iraq in the following summer. The Iraqi Government hope, as a result of his advice, to secure an improvement in the quality of tobacco grown in Iraq with a view to its export in the near future. Local production is already sufficient for the needs of the country and, unless some export outlet is found, further development will lead only to lower prices and distress amongst the cultivators.m) 41 Foreign Competition. 195. Reference has already been made to the successful attack made by Japan upon the market for cotton textiles, in which the United Kingdom was the chief loser (see paragraphs 180 and 181). Japanese competition has, however, also made itself felt in other lines, such as electrical and sanitary equipment, glass and glassware, cement, paint, hosiery and underwear, canvas and rubber shoes. In the case of hosiery and underwear of the lower grades this competition has affected the small knitting factories operating in Bagdad, while Holland, France and Italy, as well as the United Kingdom, have lost ground to the Japanese. The following figures show the rapid growth of Japanese imports into Iraq :— Year. 1930- 31 1931- 32 1932- 33 1933- 34 1934- 35 Yalue. Percentage. 98,000 1-83 210,000 4-37 425,000 6-81 706,000 11-72 1,224,000 20 04 196. German competition intensified, and in the period under review Germany doubled her sales to Iraq, the increase being 157,000 dinars. This was no doubt largely the result of the measures taken by the Reich Government to foster export industries. Part of the increase, however, must be attributed to the activities of the Jewish organisation, “ Haavareh.” France, suffering from German and Japanese competition and the gold standard, attained only two- thirds of her previous year’s share of Iraqi trade at 109,000 dinars. Italian and Dutch imports also fell off very considerably. Shipping. 197. British shipping maintained its predominant share, amounting to about three-quarters of the total, of all sea-borne traffic to and from Iraq, and regular sailings of British ships were maintained by the British India Steam Navigation Company (two ships per week between Bombay and Basra) and by the Strick Line (three ships inward and outward per month between the l nited Kingdom and Basra). 198. Two foreign companies, the Eastern Steam Navigation Company and the Lloyd Triestino Company, ceased calling at Basra. But the German ‘ ‘ Hansa ’ ’ line continued its monthly service between Basra and continental ports and a monthly call was made in turn by a ship of the Nippon 1 uren Kaisha, the Osaka Shoren Kaisha and the P. &amp; O. Steam Navigation Company. 199. There was no repetition of rate-cutting competition between foreign shipping companies, and the freight rates for dates were slightly increased. River Traffic. 200. River steamers provided a very useful link between Bagdad and Basra during the troubles on the Euphrates, when the railway line ^ a L C a QpntPmW three weeks, and were worked to full capacity. n ugus ‘ 1 navigation for the larger vessels plying on the Tigris became extiemely diffi owing to the shallowness of the river after the unusually hot season. 201 Following upon the removal of Abdul Jabbar-al-Khedery s grievances in the matter of through bills of lading no further attempt was made to question the right of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to ply on the rivers of Iraq. Tariff Negotiations. ava lm Tanan ceased to be a member of the League of Nations in March 1935 and is therefore no longer entitled to enjoy mostfavourednation t^ Iraq under article 11 of the Declaration of Guai ; ant ff Us mLtical v occasion of her admission to the League. The fact ^ nothing from Iraq had already given rise to considerable dissatisfaction a seemed likely, therefore, that the Iraqi Government might take advantage of recovered freedom of action to impose discriminatory duties on Japanese g d .42 203. A Japanese trade delegation came to Bagdad in April, presumably in the hope of reaching some agreement to safeguard Japanese commercial interests in Iraq in the changed circumstances. The delegation held protracted discussions with representatives of the Iraqi Government, and attempts were made to devise some method of ensuring a more balanced trading relationship between the two countries. No agreement was, however, reached, and it is probable that the fact that Japan wants nothing produced by Iraq which she cannot obtain more advantageously elsewhere proved to be an insuperable difficulty. 204. In August 1935 an amending law to the Iraqi Tariff Law of 1933 was passed enabling the Government to limit, by regulation of the Ministry of Finance, the importation of goods from any country or countries, if such a course is deemed desirable in the general economic interest of Iraq. So far no action has been taken under this amendment, but it is evidently aimed against Japan. United Kingdom. 205. At the time of the World Economic Conference in 1933, the Iraqi Government put forward a request that the United Kingdom duty on Iraqi dates should be abolished. This request was repeated by the Iraqi Minister in London in a note dated the 29th May, 1934. 206. Early in 1935 His Majesty’s Government decided that they could not comply with the Iraqi Government’s request unless they secured, in exchange, some compensating advantage for United Kingdom trade. In return for the abolition of the United Kingdom import duty on dates in bulk, His Majesty’s Government desired that the Iraqi Government should— (a) Take steps to restore the United Kingdom share of the Iraqi cotton piece-goods trade to the proportion which the United Kingdom enjoyed during the five years ending the 31st March, 1932. (&amp;) Introduce into the Iraqi Customs Tariff a provision to the effect that the duties on certain woollen goods should not exceed 25 per cent, ad valorem. (c) Reclassify in a specified manner the Iraqi customs duties on motor vehicles. 207. The possibility of concluding an agreement on these lines was carefully explored, but little or no progress had been made by the end of the year. Of the advantages which His Majesty’s Government wish to secure, by far the most important is that in respect of cotton piece-goods. This could most easily be arranged by the institution of some system of quotas based upon the average imports from various countries over a period of years; but the Iraqi Government appear to find it difficult either to depart in this manner from their normal tariff policy or to devise an alternative method of favouring United Kingdom cotton piece-goods. India. 208. In 1934 the Iraqi Government had complained, through His Majesty’s Embassy, to the Government of India that the balance of trade between the two countries was weighted unduly in favour of India, and had requested that the Indian tariff rates on the chief items of export from Iraq should be reduced. Early in 1935 the Government of India asked His Majesty’s Embassy to point out to the Iraq Government that the majority of the important Iraqi exports to India were on the free list. Hates were an exception, but the duty on dates was based upon the market price of each year’s crop, and there was no discrimination against the produce of Iraq. They argued, also, that India’s apparent favourable trade balance was illusory, since a great portion of the goods entered in the Iraqi trade returns as being of Indian origin were, in^fact, Japanese goods reconsigned from Indian ports. The Iraqi Government maintained, however, that there was in effect discrimination against the better qualities of Basra dates, and the Government of India, though unable to accept this contention, promised to consider favourably the reduction of duty on certain qualities of dates, and did, in fact, put into effect some small reductions shortly afterwards. The Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs returned no reply to thelast note, dated the 24th August, which His Majesty’s Embassy addressed to them on this subject, and, as the trade returns for the year 1934-35 show that the commercial exchanges between Iraq and India almost balanced at approximately 400,000 dinars, it may be assumed that the question is now closed. Palestine. 209. The negotiations for the conclusion of a modus vivendi between Palestine and Iraq are described in paragraph 38 of this report. Taxation. 210. The Iraqi income tax authorities decided, early in 1935, not to assess the British banks for taxation on interest paid by them on balances due to their correspondents abroad. 211. The amending legislation, which the Iraqi Government proposed to introduce to revise the Income Tax Law in such a way as to differentiate between “ trading in ” and “ trading with ” Iraq, was not passed; but at the end of the year there was some prospect that it might be introduced during the parlia mentary session then in progress. Meanwhile, the revenue authorities continued to demand from the local agents of firms established abroad the payment of income tax in respect of profits accruing to their principals as a result of trading with, but not in, Iraq. In a number of cases compromise settlements were reached as a result of the unofficial intervention of His Majesty’s Embassy, but others were still outstanding at the end of the year. Oil Companies. Khanaqin Oil Company and Rajidain Oil Company. 212. During 1935 the Khanaqin Oil Company distilled some 26 million gallons of crude oil at their Alwand refinery. This produced the following marketable derivatives, which were sold in Iraq :— Aviation spirit Petrol Kerosene ... Fuel oil ... Gallons. 61,954 4,010,911 4,305,771 14,668,637 Supplementary supplies were obtained from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s Abadan refinery. 213. The Rafidain Oil Company continued to market these products, the prices of which were reduced in July 1935 as shown below :— Motor spirit Kerosene Fuel oil Old price. • 75 fils per gallon 31 fils per gallon 75 fils for 8 gallons New price. 67 fils per gallon 27 fils per gallon 64 fils for 8 gallons 214. Certain questions arising from privileges claimed by the Rafidain Oil Company under the revised convention with the Iraq Petroleum Company were still under discussion between a special representative of the company and the Iraqi Government at the end of 1935. Iraq Petroleum Company. 215. The ceremonial opening of the Iraq Petroleum Company’s pipe-line system in Iraq was performed by King Ghazi at Kirkuk on the 14th January, 1935. The pipe-line had, however, been in partial use since May 1934. 216 The output of crude from the Kirkuk field through the pipe-line to the terminals at Haifa and Tripoli during 1935 was 3,557,981 tons, a total not far short of the maximum carrying capacity of the system, which is 4 million tons per year.■MMH 44 217. Further drilling was carried on during the year in order to establish the limits of the field and to complete the information as to its geological structure. The formation of the Kirkuk field is such that at present the oil Hows at an even pressure without pumping and can be simply regulated by the control settings at well-head. The company hope that it will be possible, by means of careful study of the structure and scientific control of production, to maintain ^ this ideal state of affairs for a considerable period. 218. In the latter part of 1935 the construction of a “stabilisation plant' was begun. The object of this plant is to eliminate from the crude to be pumped certain undesirable constituents of the oil and at the same time to conserve other recoverable portions at present escaping as gas. The British Oil Development Company. 219. The payment of the dead rent of £150,000 gold due on the 1st January was made within the period of three months of grace provided in the concession and amounted, with interest, to about £250,000 sterling. Most of the new capital required for this purpose was provided by Italy, whose interests in the company accordingly increased. In September two British directors, Sir Edward Mountain and Mr. Patterson, resigned from the board, which was reconstituted and is now composed of Lord Goschen as chairman, one other British director, five Italians, one Frenchman and two Germans. The Italian shareholding is stated to be 52 per cent, of the total issued. 220. Drilling activity was maintained at a high level throughout the year and at the end of November the position as regards the proved wells was stated to be as follows :— Estimated daily Depth. production. Feet. Darrels. Najmah 5 Qaiyarah 7 Qaiyarah 8 Qaiyarah 11 Qaiyarah 15 1,000 700 917 7,000 977 4,000 1,005 12,000 876 12,000 On this estimate a yearly output of about 1,800,000 tons would be possible. The quality of the oil so far won has been much inferior to that of the Kirkuk field, being thick and highly bituminous. Its transport, therefore, presents particular difficulties. There appear to be two alternatives, either to transport the crude oil by rail to the Mediterranean or to erect a “ topping ' plant and convert the crude into a semi-refined oil susceptible of being pumped through a pipe-line. In the second case, unless some revision of the concession were obtained, royalties would have to be paid on the crude oil won and not on the smaller volume of refined oil exported. 221 . The British Oil Development Company has continually had con siderable difficulty in raising sufficient capital for the payment of the dead rent due to the Iraq Government each year. In recent months the necessary money has been provided by Italy and Germany, and efforts on the part of the chairman to obtain increased British support for the company have not been successful. 222. In order to ease the position with regard to new capital, as well as to provide a means of transport for the crude oil, proposals were put forward to the Iraqi Government, that the company should build a railway from Qaiyarah to Tel Kochek and also provide the material for the link to be built by the Iraq Government between Qaiyarah and Baiji, which would complete the Northern Railway system in Iraq. The cost of this construction and material would then be set off against the dead rent due by the British Oil Development Company in 1936, 1937 and 1938. Negotiations on these lines seemed to be approaching a decisive stage in the latter part of December, when unexpected modifications in the views of the Iraq Government on railway construction took place. The idea of railway construction undertaken by the British Oil Development Company was rejected and the proposed alignment was abandoned for a scheme to link the Iraq system with that of Turkey at Diarbekr. 1935 thus closed with the prospects of early agreement between the British Oil Development Company and the Iraq Government in this matter almost as remote as at any time during the year.Other Concessions. 223. The scheme for a cement factory was taken up by a United Kingdom concern, the Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers, who sent out two experts, accompanied by Mr. Rickett as negotiator, in March 1935. Exhaustive technical investigations were made and a site was chosen within the Royal Air Force cantonment at Hinaidi as being the most advantageous available. The intervention of His Majesty’s Embassy was sought in order to obtain the sanction both of the Iraqi Government and of the Air Ministry to the cession of the plot of ground required. A reply was received from the Iraq Government to the effect that the application should be made direct by the company through the Ministry of Economics and Communications, and enquiry showed that no company had at that point been formed or registered. Mr. Rickett had disappeared from the scene by this time, and the two representatives of the Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers shortly afterwards left Bagdad. The efforts of the Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers in this matter seem to have been largely misdirected. 224. Yassin Pasha A1 Hashimi holds a concession for the exploitation of the two best areas yielding the raw materials for the manufacture of cement at Qarachoq Hagh and Hit, and it is thought in some quarters that no cement company will be floated till his present term of office as Prime Minister is terminated and he can again give full attention to his private affairs. On the other hand, there are signs that a group of leading Iraqis may form a company in the near future which will proceed to establish a factory. 225. There was again talk of the proposal to grant a concession for a bus service in Bagdad, but no actual steps were taken in this direction. Mr. Rickett was said to be angling for a larger transport concession to cover all means of transport within the country, but there is no evidence that his proposals were ever given any serious consideration. Bagdad Electric Light and Power Company. 226. The campaign in the local press against the alleged excessive charges for current was continued, though perhaps with less pertinacity than before. 227. An attempt was made to embarrass the company by starting a move ment to demand that the collection of bills should be effected by house-to-house visits of a company collector. the issue was not carried to the couits, and a compromise was reached between the company and the Ministry of Economics and Communications whereby the company opened three new offices (at Muadham, South Gate and Bagdad West), where bills might be paid. 228. In August the charge for lighting current was reduced by 1 fil. This concession was greeted by a new series of articles in the pi ess adveisely comment ing on the company and calling attention to the fact that the late foi cunent in &amp; Basra was 2 fils less than the reduced Bagdad charge. 229. Sir William Max Muller visited Bagdad in the late spring, presumably in order to try to clear the path of the company of some of the obstacles that it so frequently encounters, but there is no evidence of his having achieved any success. Latifiyah Estates [Limited). 230. In January 1935 this company passed into the hands of Andrew Weir and Co. The new'directorate is composed as follows: Sir Lionel iletcher, W. S. Gregg (both of the earlier directorate), A. L. Weir and F. W. Rickett. Mr. Garbutt continued to occupy the position of local managei. 231. The negotiations with the Iraqi Government to lessen the burden of the obligations of the company in respect of the Latiflyah canal were continued, an it was eventually agreed that the ownership of the canal should ,revert to the Government, whilst the company should be relieved of the debt of £55,000 o account of the construction of the canal by the Irrigation Department Is agreement still lacked parliamentary approval at the end of the year, but the local manager confidently expected that this would not be withheld.46 232. From the production point of view the estate had a satisfactory year. The cotton and linseed crops were good, and the wool clip remunerative, and, on the assumption that the agreement with the Iraqi Government is signed, the year’s working, after all expenses are paid and depreciation allowed for at a generous figure, shows a slight profit. The outlook for the company may therefore be said t(? be promising. As the only example of large-scale farming undertaken upon a scientific and business basis (unlike the Rustam farm, which is purely experi mental), the Latifiyah Estates Company undoubtedly serves a useful purpose in this country, and it would appear that both public and private interest will be served by the conclusion of a less onerous agreement between it and the Government. Government Works. Kut Barrage. 233. Work on the Kut Barrage proceeded according to programme during 1035 and the contractors were satisfied with the progress made. Certain unexpected difficulties which arose were successfully overcome. The abnormally hio-h winter freshets in December, when the water rose to high levels not expected t 0 Toe reached until the floods in February or March, caused considerable anxiety for some days, but no extensive harm was caused. Habbaniyah Escape. 234. During 1935 the Iraqi Government again failed to take any steps to carry out the Habbaniyah Escape scheme. 235. This question is now of direct interest to His Majesty s Government because, in 1937, it will be necessary for the flying boats, which will be used m the augmented service of Imperial Airways (Limited) (see paragraphs 250-253) to alight on the lake, and it is doubtful whether there will by that time be a sufficient depth of water. There is not time for the complete Habbaniyah Escape project, as originally conceived, to be carried out by 1937, so that, even if the Iraqi Government decide at once to proceed with it, temporary measures will have to be taken to ensure an adequate depth of water until the main scheme is completed. A number of proposals designed to achieve this object were still being examined by Air Headquarters and the adviser to the Ministry of Economics and Communications at the end of the year. Tigris Bridges. 236. The scheme to provide Bagdad with two steel bridges over the Tigris likewise failed to materialise in 1935. The record of the Iraq Government in respect of this particular scheme is one of delay and indecision. Provision for two bridges was first made in the budget of 1933. Messrs. Coode, Wilson, Mitchell and Vaughan Lee were instructed to draw up plans, but considerable dissension arose in the Council of Ministers as to the location of the bridges. In 1934 a revised Capital Works Law reduced the number of bridges to be built to one. Early in 1935, on the advice of the consulting engineers, the original proposal for two bridges was again adopted. 1935 was frittered away in the discussion of the desirability of various sites and the method of calling for tenders. A second visit in December 1935 of a member of the firm of consulting engineers appears to have led to the resolution of these problems, and it is hoped that calls for tenders will be made in February 1936. V.— Communications. Roads. 237 No extensive work on new roads was carried out during the year under review The road between Mosul and Tel Kochek was improved. Work on the Bagdad-Khanaqin road was continued, but no considerable new stretch was opened for traffic and this important artery is still very neglected, possibly because it is felt that the railway serves that route sufficiently well.23ft. The completion of the bridge over the Greater Zab on the Mosul-Erbil road was delayed by the heavy spring floods which carried away the uncompleted foundations, work on which had begun in 1934. 239. Minor improvements were carried out on other routes and the maintenance of existing highways was satisfactory. Trans-Desert Routes. (a) To Syria and Palestine. 240. The course of the negotiations for a modus vivendi between Iraq and the Government of Palestine having as its object the encouragement of the direct Haifa-Bagdad route is described in paragraph 38 of this report. 241. A certain amount of rivalry already exists between the two routes. The Palestine route is longer and presents greater difficulties than the Syrian, but port facilities at Haifa to some extent balance these disadvantages. Haim Nathaniel continued to be the main operator on the Palestine route, but towards the end of the year the “ Compagnie Auto Routiere du Levant ” registered itself in Palestine and began to run a few trucks in competition with him. Passenger transport continued to use exclusively the Bagdad-Damascus route. 242. Improvements to the Damascus-Bagdad track were made both in Syria and Iraq. In Syria the very bad stretch extending from just outside Damascus to the frontier post of Abu Chamat was metalled, whilst the Iraq Government began the construction of a road starting at Ramadi and running 50 kilom. in a westerly direction. The effect of these improvements has been to enable cars to cross the desert in one or two hours less time than was previously taken. 243. Freight rates were slightly reduced during the year to a minimum of £7 a ton for certain classes of goods. Individual truck owners occasionally undercut this rate, but the main operators, Haim Nathaniel and the Compagnie Auto Routiere, had a tacit understanding not to reduce the rates below the agreed minimum. 244. In December unexpectedly heavy rains repeatedly hampered desert traffic and many buses and lorries were bogged. The Nairn Transport Company, however, thanks to skilful drivers and the use of tractors in the muddiest region, managed to maintain a reasonably reliable service. (b) To Saudi Arabia. 245. In February 1935 an agreement was concluded between the Iraqi and Saudi Arabian Governments regarding the proposed trans-desert pilgrim route from Najaf to Medina, which had been surveyed and crossed by experimental convoys in 1934. The two Governments agreed to improve the condition of the road and to take steps to ensure the safety of travellers thereon, each within their own territory. Transport between Najaf and Medina was conceded to the Iraqi Government, whilst the Saudi Arabian Government reserved the right to carry passengers between Medina and Mecca. 246. The conclusion of this agreement enabled the road to be opened for the Haj of 1935, and it was in fact used by some 400 pilgrims, including a party of 70 Iraqi boy scouts and 22 British Indians. travelling conditions were reported to be strenuous, as was only to be expected in view of the hasty and possibly premature opening of the route. It is confidently expected that there will be a large increase in the number of pilgrims adopting this itinerary in 1936. Steps are reported to have been taken to make the Iraqi portion of the track less difficult. Telegraphs and Telephones. 247. The wireless telegraph circuit between Basra and the Saudi Arabian station at Riyadh was made available for commercial use. Previously it had been limited to official messages.248. A trunk telephone service between Iraq and Palestine was inaugurated on the 27th November. Consequently, communication with Egypt and Syria is now possible via Jerusalem. Civil Aviation. General. 249. Towards the end of 1935 civil aviation was transferred from the Ministry of Economics and Communications to the Ministry of Defence. A separate budget was prepared and money was voted for three all-weather runways at the Bagdad airport. Additional garages, offices, stores, and small hangars are being built, and a large hangar and an up-to-date fire engine have been ordered. The possibility of starting a National Airways Company is said to be under consideration. Proposed Co-operation of Iraqi Government in New Air Mail Scheme. 250. In May His Majesty’s Embassy explained to the Iraqi Government the purpose and the scope of the new air mail scheme, which His Majesty’s Govern ment in the United Kingdom hoped to introduce in 1937, and invited them to participate in it. 251. Immediately afterwards a party of experts from the Air Ministry and the General Post Office visited Bagdad to discuss the scheme with the Iraqi authorities. Their object was to persuade the Iraqi Government: (1) to provide certain facilities in respect of ground organisation, and ( 2 ) in return for the privilege of participating in the scheme, to contribute financially towards it partly by annual lump sum payments over a period of fifteen years and partly by entering into an arrangement whereby they would (a) contribute by way of subsidy an amount equivalent to the total of the landing and housing fees payable by the operating company, and (h) remit taxes on fuel and lubricants. 252. The experts found that the Iraqi Government were already contem plating the provision, on their own account, of adequate ground organisation. But it proved difficult to convince the Iraqi authorities that it would be of financial advantage to the Iraqi Government to participate in the scheme, owing to the fact that they were still benefiting by an experimental arrangement, introduced some years before, whereby Imperial Airways (Limited) carried their mails at an exceptionally low rate. The General Post Office had already decided that this arrangement must be terminated and the experts advised that the only hope of persuading the Iraqi Government to participate in the new scheme was to give immediate notice of its termination. 253. This notice was given by the General Post Office in June, and later His Majesty’s Embassy explained to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs the arrange ments which His Majesty’s Government were prepared to offer for the carriage of Iraqi mails— (a) If the Iraqi Government did not propose to participate in the new air mail scheme; (b) Until the introduction of the new scheme, on the understanding that the Iraqi Government would participate in it. The arrangement offered under (b) was naturally more favourable to the Iraqi Government and, under the terms of the Postal Union Convention, necessarily so. But no decision had been reached by the end of the year. A ir Mail Charges. 254. Following upon the termination of the experimental arrangement referred to above, the Iraqi Department of Posts and Telegraphs announced that revised rates of air mail surcharge would be levied as from the 30th August.The new air surcharges on air mail correspondence (other than air mail letter cards) are as follows :— Countries of destination. Air surcharge in addition to ordinary postage on — Postcards. Letters and Palestine, Transjordan, Egypt, other articles. the Isles of Crete and Malta, Saudi Arab Kingdom, Yemen and Aden, Abyssinia and Somalilnnds. 4 fils per postcard. 7 fils per 10 grs. or fraction. Europe, England, America,' Turkey-in-Europe, West Africa. &gt; \ 10 fils per , postcard. 18 fils per 10 grs. or fraction. Iraqi Meteorological Service. 255. The transfer of the Royal Air Force to Dhibban, which is due to take place in 1937, will involve the cessation of the extensive meteorological work now carried out at Hinaidi and Mosul. At the same time the need for an efficient meteorological organisation in Iraq is likely to become greater than ever owing ( 1 ) to the development of civil aviation in and through Iraq, and (2) to the increasing requirements of the Iraqi Air Force. 256. To meet this situation the Iraqi Government decided to establish a meteorological service of their own as early as possible in 1936. The Iraqi authorities discussed proposals for its organisation with the experts from the Air Ministry and General Post Office (see paragraph 251 above), and the considered advice of the Air Ministry was communicated to the Iraqi Government by His Majesty’s Embassy in November. It is proposed that, in the first instance, the head of the Royal Air Force meteorological service in Iraq shall assume the additional duties of Director of the Iraqi Meteorological Department. Regular Air Services. 257. Imperial Airways and K.L.M. increased their services to two departures westbound and eastbound per week from Bagdad. 258. The Air France shuttle service between Bagdad and Damascus was discontinued in November. Their Saigon service continued its weekly flights. 259. No major accidents befell any commercial aircraft in Iraq in 1935. VI. —Am and Military Matters. Royal A ir Force. Strength. 260. The distribution of the Royal Air Force in Iraq remained unchanged with the exception that the flying-boat squadron at Basra left the country during the period July to September and has not yet returned, the distribution of the fighting units at their permanent stations was as follows : Hinaidi— 1 bomber squadron. 1 bomber-transport squadron. 2 sections armoured cars. Mosul— 1 bomber squadron. 1 section armoured cars. Shaibah— 1 bomber squadron. 1 section armoured cars.50 Command. 261. During 1935, Air Vice-Marshal W. G. S. Mitchell, C.B., C.B.E., D.S.O., M.C., A.E.C., was the Air Officer Commanding the British Forces in Iraq. Summer Training Cani'p. 262. The annual summer training camp at Ser Amadia was reopened from the 17th June till the 23rd September. Friendly relations were maintained with the local inhabitants, and no untoward incident occurred. One half Kurdish company of the Iraq levies was provided for guard duties. Royal Air Force in the Persian Gulf. 263. The importance to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom of the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf has greatly increased during recent years. His Majesty’s Government have accordingly given serious consideration to the possibility of guaranteeing the security of the Trucial Sheikhs, such guarantee to be implemented, in case of necessity, by the use of aircraft from the landward side and of naval forces from the seaward. An agreement concluded in 1935, whereby His Majesty’s Government undertook to protect the Sheikh of Qatar from external aggression, may be regarded as the first step towards putting this policy into effect. 264. The effectiveness of co-operation between the Royal Air Force and His Majesty’s sloops in the Gulf was twice clearly demonstrated during 1935. On the first occasion, the simultaneous appearance of a demonstration flight and of one of His Majesty’s sloops sufficed to settle a domestic squabble between the Sheikh of Dibai and two of his cousins; on the second, a threat that His Majesty’s sloops would blockade his pearling fleet caused the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi to withdraw his opposition to the erection of a petrol store on the landing ground in his territory, in accordance with the terms of the agreement negotiated with him at the end of 1934. 265. In order to accustom the Trucial Sheikhs to the presence of aircraft and to demonstrate their capacity for rapid action at any point, the Air Officer Commanding arranged for frequent visits to be made to the Gulf during 1935. New landing grounds were prepared and all those already established up to the boundary of the district under the Aden Command have now been visited by air. The route to Aden can, therefore, be considered complete, both for land- planes and seaplanes. Bomb stores are being built at Bahrein and Sharjah, and there is already one in existence at Muscat. 266. An excellent liaison exists with the Persian Gulf sloops, and the senior naval officer in the Persian Gulf has assisted the Royal Air Force in every way he can by helping forced-landed aircraft, escorting landing ground reconnaissances, &amp;c. In return, the Royal Air Force have frequently provided air transport for naval personnel and urgent sick cases. Air headquarters is superintending the construction of the new naval buildings at Bahrein. Development of Civil Air Route. 267. A party of experts from the Air Ministry and the General Post Office visited the Command in 1935 to make preliminary arrangements in regard to the extended airways services beginning in 1937, by which date it is intended to carry by air all first-class mail. Their negotiations with the Iraqi authorities are described in paragraphs 251 to 253 above. 268. A complete list of the night flying, wireless telegraphy, navigational and meteorological equipment required has been tabulated. It is intended to run three landplane and two flying boat services per week through the Command, the flying boats alighting at Lake Habbaniyah. The requirements for this alighting area, including the maintenance of level of water in the lake (see paragraphs 234-235), have been examined and a report submitted to the Air Ministry.51 269. Ihe Hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was consulted and is endeavouring to arrange for the facilities required in the Gulf, including night-flying beacons. 270. An experimental beacon is shortly to be established at L.G. 5 . 271. An Imperial Airways representative has recently carried out a reconnaissance for an alighting area at Ras-ahKhaimah and Uibai, and has examined Umm-al-Qaiwain in addition to the two places named. Inter-Command and Colonial Development Flights. 272. With a view to training squadrons in long-distance flights and reinforcement moves, the following cruises were scheduled to take place during the winter 1935-36 :— (i) Two flying boats of No. 203 (F.B.) Squadron from Basra to Aden. This cruise, originally intended to go as far as Aden and back, was to be extended to East Africa for the purposes of colonial development. (ii) No. 84 (B.) Squadron, accompanied by bomber-transport aircraft of No. 70 (B.T.) Squadron, to the Far East. (iii) One flight of No. 55 (B.) Squadron to Aden. (iv) Five bomber-transport aircraft of No. 70 (B.T.) Squadron to India and thence to the Far East. 273. As a result of the Italo-Abyssinian crisis, all these cruises had to be cancelled when nearly all the detailed arrangements for them had been made. Much useful experience and information was, however, obtained, and it was revealed that several modifications to reinforcement schemes might be necessary. 274. Flights of the squadrons concerned in reinforcement schemes have been making monthly cruises to the Middle East and down the Persian Gulf. In consequence, both routes are familiar to these units and no difficulty or elaborate organisation is involved in using them. At the same time, pilots are practised in long-distance flying, which presents particular problems of its own. 275. Permission was sought to extend Gulf cruises to Karachi. The proposal was favourably commented upon by India, but general permission to carry it out has not yet been obtained. 276. A cruise by a flight of No. 84 (B.) Squadron in October 1935, which started for Karachi, was stopped by bad weather encountered beyond Gwadur, and returned. But the main object of the cruise, which was to investigate the refuelling arrangements at Gwadur in anticipation of the planned cruise to the Far East, was achieved. Command Air Exercise, 1935. 277. A command air exercise, taking the form of a concentration scheme embracing elements of certain units in the command, was ordered to take place between the 18th and 21st September, based on Baiji landing ground. 278. The following forces from Mosul and Hinaidi were detailed to take part:— 2 bomber squadrons. 1 bomber-transport squadron. 2 sections of armoured cars. 1 company of Iraq levies. The aims of the exercise were— {a) To practise air headquarters and units in Iraq in carrying out an operation they may be called upon to perform in war. (h) To give the Air Officer Commanding an opportunity of testing the operational efficiency of his command. Owing to the Italo-Abyssinian crisis, the air exercise had to be cancelled at the last moment, but not before useful experience had been obtained by staff officers and unit commanders in the preparation of movement, administrative and operation orders.Landing Grounds. 279 The policy regarding the maintenance and upkeep of landing grounds in the command has recently been reviewed. Only such landing grounds as may be required in the event of external aggression and for the maintenance of internal security are now maintained. A certain number of other landing grounds, though retained for emergency purposes, are no longer maintained. Air Mail between Iraq and Cairo. 280 A weekly air mail between Bagdad and Cairo was maintained by aircraft of the Iraq and Middle East Commands throughout the year. This mail was composed of service secret and confidential correspondence and Foi eign O ce bags from Bagdad and Tehran for delivery to Cairo for onward despatch by courier. Surveys. 281. The survey of the Western Desert for the Rutbah sheet of the 1/500,000 map series was completed in April and a provisional edition of tns map was then locally produced. 282 Field work in the Southern Desert west of Samawa was, however, interrupted by the Middle Euphrates disturbances. Some work was then done on unsurveyed areas near Bagdad before the hot weather made further field woi \ inadvisable. 283. This work will continue on the arrival from England of another survey officer. Iraq Levies. Organisation. 284. There has been no change in the organisation of the Iiaq le\ies during the year. Establishment. 285. (a) Officers. —The establishment of British officers has been increased by four subalterns to allow two British officers for each company. (b) Other Ranks. —There was a temporary increase of fifty native other ranks in order to provide a nucleus of trained personnel to replace those men from the Assyrian companies who are emigrating to Syria, and thus avoid a lengthy period during which the force would be much below strength in ti ained men. These recruits, who are Arabs from the Amara district, are being trained at Makinah, and the company at Shaibah is being increased by fifty men to make room for them. Training. 286. Normal training has been continuous during the year, and hand and rifle grenade training has been added to the syllabus. The progress of the training of the fifty recruits mentioned above has been most satisfactory. The Iraqi Army. General. 287. Although at the end of 1934 official military opinion in Iraq discounted the possibility of internal trouble, the year 1935 was marked by serious tribal revolts in the Middle Euphrates, Qurna, and Beled Smjai, as well as by laigc scale operations against bandits in the Barzan area. These outbreaks were eventually suppressed by active operations on the part of the army, but the heavy demand for troops emphasised the urgent need for expansion. Schemes, already formulated, were accelerated by two years, so as to organise the army during 1936-37 into two divisions, each consisting of three infantry brigades of three battalions, one field and one mountain artillery brigade each of three six-gun batteries, one engineer company, one signal battalion, one field ambulance, and a divisional motor transport company. Further expansion to three divisions and a mobile division are planned for completion by 1940-41.288. After the success of the army in the operations in the south during March to June, the new Government considered itself strong enough to issue instructions for the National Service Law to take effect from the 1 st January, 1936. Active measures were taken from June onwards to register eligible males between the ages of 18 and 21 , and by the end of the year arrangements had so far progressed that an influx of about 5,000 conscripts was expected in training depots by the beginning of the new year. 289. Although attention has been focussed on the internal troubles and the expansion scheme, plans to meet external aggression have not been lost sight of. This subject has been examined on both the eastern and northern frontiers, and schemes are being worked out in detail for concentration either against Iran or Turkey. National Service (see also paragraphs 126-128 above). 290. Arrangements for the recruiting organisation necessary for the intro duction of conscription were undertaken in May, when a number of pensioned military officers were re-employed at recruiting centres. Active measures were then taken to register all eligible males between the ages of 18 and 21 in districts where the census had been completed. Where the census had not been carried out, as in the desert and certain parts of Kurdistan, the chiefs are, it is understood, being instructed to send in the requisite quota of men selected by themselves. 291. On the assumption that about 50 per cent, of the men of suitable age will be exempted for health and other reasons, the 1914—17 classes are estimated to total 46,000. During 1936, the 1917 class will be called up for three to five months’ training according to the arm of the service to which they are dratted, and a portion of the 1914 and 1915 classes will also be trained for short periods. To meet the needs of accommodation and training, present depots are being enlarged and new infantry depots are being constructed at Bagdad, Amaia and Basra; and in certain out-stations units will train their own recruits. A syllabus of training has been drawn up, it includes simplified infantry drill, which will shorten the period necessary for training. Budget. . 292 The budget allotment for 1935-36 for the army and air force was 990 820 dinars, but the operations on the various fronts caused considerable excess expenditure, of which 20,000 dinars for movements of troops has been disclosed During 1935 270 000 dinars was expended on arms, equipment and buildings ou S 49^000 dinars allotted for 1935-36 from the oil royalties. For the years from 1936-37 until 1939-40, a further sum of 1,551,000 dinars has been allocated i this source to the Ministry of Defence. The expansion now planned will demand even greater sums than these, principally for the purchase of guns, ammunition and armoured fighting vehicles. Sti eng h. ^35 t h e total strength of the army and air force had battery and one “^^eC/ba^^ from a 4 -gun to a 6 -gun company were formed—while foui tt platoons added during 1934 to basis : The battalionswwe forme^from the ^our^ v ^ ^ of existing battalions, the latter bein g . in officers is 145 out of an three platoons per company.

One motor machine gun company of sixteen cars. Two squadrons Royal Iraqi Air Force (see paragraph 325 for detail). 295. The administrative services and training units comprise :— One motor transport company. Four animal transport companies. Medical service, including one cadre field ambulance. Veterinary and remount services. Ordnance services, including a small arms ammunition factory. Depots and schools for the various arms and services. Organisation. 296. The only change of importance was the sub-division of the Southern District by the formation of the Euphrates District, with headquarters at Diwaniyah, comprising the area from that liwa to Basra. The troops in the district include a battalion and a section of a mountain artillery battery at Nasiriyah, which was first occupied during the Euphrates rebellion. 297. New defence regulations have been under consideration with the object of defining more precisely the relation between the Ministry and the members of the Defence Council and of decentralising control so as to leave certain responsibilities to district commanders. As some extremely debatable points have arisen, no decisions have as yet been taken. Operations. 298. Tribal unrest and anti-Government demonstrations occurred in March in the Diwaniyah area. Military columns were based on Diwaniyah and Hillah and operated in the Kufah and Abu Sukhair areas, but no active operations were undertaken. 299. In May. however, tribal unrest broke out on a larger scale in the Middle Euphiates and at Nasiriyah and Suq-al-Shiyukh. Considerable damage was done to Government property and rail communication between Bagdad and Basra was severed. The authorities took prompt measures to suppress the outbreak with aii action and troop concentrations. A large force of all arms was formed at Diwaniyah, and on the 15th May an advance astride the Euphrates was made on Rumaitha, the centre of the trouble. This town was occupied on the 17th May and casualties were inflicted on the rebels. Their leader, Sheikh Khawwam, was captured and his brother killed. Meanwhile, disquieting news had been received from Nasiriyah, and two infantry battalions were despatched there by road from Bagdad, via Kut-el-Amarah and the Hai. The expeditious arrival of this force on the 17th May had a marked effect on the attitude of the tribes in the Muntafiq and Nasiriyah areas. Two armed ships were also despatched from Basra to Qurnah. The Rumaitha column reached Ur Junction on the 27th May, when through communication on the railway between Bagdad and Basra was restored The difficult nature of the country round Suq-al-Shiyukh necessitated the forma tion of a river force at Nasiriyah, which, in co-operation with the armed ships from Qurnah, occupied Suq on the 2 nd June. Punitive measures were undertaken against the tribes, and by the 20 th June the civil authorities had re-established -control in the marsh areas. 300. At the outset General Bekr Sidqi, who was put in command of all the 11 oops south of Bagdad, had been given authority to declare martial law when and where he thought necessary. Military tribunals were accordingly set up to punish the imgleaders of the revolt. Many were punished bv death sentences and imprisonment; rifle and money fines were also levied. Troops remained in the disaffected areas for some weeks, and on the 26th July a review was held by His Majesty King Ghazi at Diwaniyah, where the bulk of the forces had been concentrated. The troops then gradually dispersed to their peace stations.55 301. In August minor trouble arose in the Qurnah liwa at A1 Makin over the registration of conscripts. Air action was undertaken and two companies of infantry were despatched from Basra. After some fighting, in which casualties were sustained by both sides, the tribes submitted and the situation was restored. 302. The situation in Kurdistan at the beginning of the year was most unsatisfactory, and bands of outlaws were terrorising the inhabitants in both the Sulaimani and Mergasor areas. In Sulaimani the 2nd Frontier Battalion had a successful affray with the bandits in March, and cleared up the situation, but at Mergasor a Kurd, named Khalil Khoshawi, raised a band reported to be over 200 strong. Active measures were undertaken against him. Police posts in the Barzan area were taken over by the army and arrangements were made to co-operate with the Turkish forces across the border. It was not until August, however, when a force of three battalions was concentrated and martial law was proclaimed, that any success was attained. The armed police then had several successful encounters with the bandits, and by the end of September Khalil Khoshawi was reported to have fled into Iran and the bulk of his followers were imprisoned. 303 In September further trouble in connexion with the National Service Law broke out among the Yazidis in the Jabal Sinjar, of whom some 200 or 300 under a chieftain named Daud-i-Daud, evacuated their villages and toov to the hills. A punitive force was concentrated on the 6 th October, and m co-operation with armed police and aircraft carried out a drive m the disaffected area Considerable opposition was met at the outset and the force sustained some forty casualties in killed and wounded. The rebels suffered severe y their casualties, as reported by the Iraqi Government, amounting to over 200 killed and 120 wounded. By the 15th October the rebel chiefs, with the exception ol Daud-i-Daud himself, who escaped with a few of his supporters over the Syrian frontier, had submitted to the Government. Martial law which had been proclaimed in the area on the 12th October, was suspended on the 14th November. Training. . , 304 The training programme for the year was considerably interrupted y the operations mentioned above. The individual training of some units suffered severely and it was not until September, when units had returned to then peace stations and men had returned from leave, that any serious efforts were made *0 renair the deficiency. Collective training began m October and althougff tffe operations in the Sinjar interfered with units in the Mosul district training camps were held at Qaraghan and Kirkuk for the troops of the Southern and FnXrn Districts respectively. An artillery practice camp was also held m Qaraghan, and although the firing was confined to batteries of “ t Eastern Districts only, a number of artillery officers fiom the Noithern D attended The present standard of training of officers and men is not hig according to British army standards, but the operations provided admirable experience for commanders and staffs, and proved the army to be adequate for internal security duties. qiK Regular courses took place throughout the year at the various instruc- vonnp- men from secondarv schools as n.c.o. s, and suitable aim) n.c.o. s weie Sd as platan commanders to meet the present shortage of officers and to provide a potential reserve of officers m time o wai. t- i j ^ 306 The number of officers and n.c.o.’s undergoing courses m England and India increased the most noticeable addition being the attendance of Iraqi aim Lnaia mcieasea, uicn u n cnoff Polleo’es Everv effort is made to officers at both the Camberley and Quetta b e A 5 m ents have now been send suitable candidates on courses abroad, yfarjangements have nowuee made to promote the study of English amongst army officers so as to widen tne field of selection.

This was necessitated by the delay in supply of new Lewis guns from the United Kingdom for the new line battalions. 308. The wireless equipment of the signal battalion has been increased .to include eight wireless telegraph stations. The purchase of two high-power wireless telegraphy and telephony permanent stations is being considered. 309. The following purchases of mechanical transport were made during the year :— (i) Forty lorries, two vans, four touring cars and five ambulance chassis, all of American manufacture. (ii) Two British and one American armoured car chassis. (iii) Twenty-six British motor cycles. A dministrative Services. 310. Greater attention has been paid to administration, and its importance is being emphasised by the consideration of concentration schemes in the event of war with Iran and Turkey. 311. The new supply system proved its value during the operations in the summer and autumn, when administrative arrangements were satisfactory, often under great difficulties. 312. A serious scandal over the construction of barracks at Mosul by the Public Works Department supplied the necessary impetus for the formation of a Military Works Directorate. This Department now makes its own contracts and supervises all buildings and construction. During the year a start was made on a new cantonment for some 3,500 troops at Kirkuk, while considerable enlarge ments took place at Mosul and Diwaniyah, and new barracks are in hand at Bagdad, Amarah and Qaraghan. Ordnance. 313. Approximately 2 million live rounds, 50,000 blank, and 15,000 dummy rounds of -303 ammunition were made at the ammunition factory. Leather belts and bandoliers, in lieu of web equipment, w^ere issued to about 75 per cent, of the infantry units. An order was placed with a firm in Czechoslovakia for the supply of 20,000 rifles. These rifles are the 1914 pattern, and are old war stock manu factured in the LTnited States. Arrangements were made for considerable expansion of ordnance establishments, including the addition of a rifle factory and the enlargement of repair workshops. Future Policy. 314. As already indicated above, two divisions will be formed and head quarters staffs provided during the year 1936-37. This will entail the raising of five new battalions, three 6 -gun batteries and four sections of artillery, engineer battalion headquarters and one company, a signal battalion, a field ambulance, and one mechanical transport company. 315. One section of a medium battery ( 6 -inch howitzers) will be formed, and it is proposed to form a Cavalry Brigade Headquarters and to reform the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, by reducing the two existing regiments temporarily to two sabre squadrons and a machine-gun squadron. Royal Iraqi Air Force. Operations. 316. The Royal Iraqi Air Force was used four times on internal security operations during the year in support of the Iraqi Army and to demonstrate over the heads of rebels :— ( 1 ) During March several demonstration flights, one of seventeen aircraft, were ordered over the affected area. Some reconnaissance work was done.57 ( 2 ) During the period the 8 th May to the 20th June, when the tribes revolted in the Rumaitha area and in the Lower Euphrates, the Royal Iraqi Air Force was constantly used to bomb the rebels. Twelve Hawker- Nisr and four De Havilland Dragon aircraft were used, over 1,200 bombs being dropped during about 700 hours hying. The aircraft were employed mainly on diving bombing from 2,000 feet to disperse concentrations. (3) During the period the 27th August to the 17th September, four Hawker- Nisr aircraft operated against rebel tribes in the Qurnah area, dropping warnings first and then bombs. In all, 360 20 -lb. bombs, four 112-lb. bombs, and 4,000 incendiary bombs were dropped. (4) During the period the 6 th to the 15th October seven Hawker-Nisr aircraft co-operated with other Iraqi army units against Yazidi rebels of the Jebel Sinjar. Rebel villages were frequently bombed. Recon naissances were made. A rmy-A ir Co-operation. 317. Army-air co-operation remained weak throughout the year under review both during operations and training periods. Only a beginning has as yet been made by the Iraqi army to study the problems of modern co-operation with aircraft, the subject has been repeatedly stressed since the weakness ot army—air co-operation was disclosed during the manocu^ies of 1934. Training. 318. Training proceeded normally throughout the year. One hundred and twenty apprentices, of whom twenty-five will pass out in April 1936, are under training as mechanics. Eighteen pupils are undei tiaming as pi p se five will pass out in January 1936, and the remaining thirteen Individual training of pilots for war proceeded slowly, being mte times by operations and demonstrations. Training has started i bombing, low-altitude bombing, aerial gunnery, photography, ms amongst other subjects. in April 1936. rrupted several n high-altitude trument flying, Air Display. 319 The Royal Iraqi Air Force gave their first air display on the 2nd May&gt; 1935 His Maiestv the King and the Diplomatic Corps were present.

Courses in England. 5 320 (1) One officer returned from a two years course at the Otticers Engineering Course of the Royal Air Force at Henlow. One/ other officer will complete two years on this com se in Jul\ 1936. (2) One officer completed the air navigation course at Andover ( 3 ) One officer completed the Central Flying School course at Wittering. ( 4 ) One officer has left for the armament course at Eastchurch. British Royal Air Force Personnel. 321. Squadron-Leader H. E. Forrow and Flight-Lieutenant A. L. Franks had their contracts extended. One British n.c.o. also had his contract extended. Two others left on the expiration of their contracts and are being replaced. Equipment. 322. The Hawker and the De Havilland aircraft have given excellent seivice and have fully justified their selection. Upwards of 5,000 hours have been flown with remarkably few accidents. One life, that of an airman, was unfortunately lost during the year as the result of an accident. Three new De Havn and Tio-er Moths were delivered to the flying training school. Eighteen new Hawker- Nisr and three new De Havilland Tiger Moths have recently been ordered; also a De Havilland Dragonfly for King Ghazi. A wide range of all spares has been ordered, to increase the reserve from six to twelve months. Machine tools and other equipment arrived during the year, to equip the workshops to scale.323.

APART from several incidents connected with the frontier dispute with Persia, and its final reference to the League of Nations, the year was uneventful and brought a welcome relief from the critical events of 1932-33. 2. Comparative quiescence in Iraq, however, cannot safely be regarded as indicative of complete internal well-being. Since the relaxation of British control, the standard of administration has been steadily deteriorating. It was not to be expected, however, that British standards would be maintained by an independent Iraqi Government, and there is nothing in present conditions in the country which need be held to deny the hope that the Iraqi Government will maintain an administration equal, if not in some respects superior, to that to be found in neighbouring Moslem States. The worst and most characteristic defect of the administrative work of Iraqi Ministers and senior officials is their incurable habit of interference in the organisation of the personnel of their Ministries. Each change of Cabinet brings about an extensive reshuffle of Civil Service appointments and, consequently, a serious break in continuity of the work of the Departments. It is a satisfactory sign that the local newspapers do not hesitate to bring to notice the harmful results of this practice. 3. Ir view of his own inexperience, King Ghazi intervened only very occasionally in r^ministrative affairs, but His Majesty’s iVmbassador has always found him ready to accept views which he could understand and take action accordingly within the somewhat narrow limits of his personal influence. His decision to recall Rustam Haidar to the Palace as Chief Secretary and intimate adviser was wise, and it is hoped that the man on whom the late King Faisal used to place so much reliance will be able to counteract the unhealthy influences which have been brought to bear on His Majesty by dissolute uncles and the young officers who are his favourite company. 4. There is no lack of goodwill in the country towards the Sovereign, but it is unfortunate that His Majesty does not seem to have inherited his father’s aptitude and tact in talking with the sheikhs who come to visit him, while his want of knowledge of tribal life and customs and his impatience of personal or political discussions do not conduce to his popularity. One of King Faisal’s strongest assets was his profound intimacy with Bedouin life and tireless willingness to receive and converse with the tribal leaders on all subjects. 5 . The Assyrian problem remained virtually in statu quo, and it is much to be regretted that no suitable territory outside Iraq has yet been found in which to settle the ex-Ottoman Assyrians who wish to leave this country. In the adoption of a policy of resettlement outside Iraq lies the only hope of a permanent solution of the Assyrian problem.[11315] b 2 3 6 . In spite of many obvious defects, it is probably true to say that Iraq compares very favourably with a large number of her fellow members in the League of Nations. As the relevant sections of this report show, Iraq’s economic future is full of hope. Assured of a steady and sufficient revenue so long as oil still continues to occupy its place in the world, Iraq continues to manage her finances on sound and conservative lines and to follow a cautiously progressive policy in economic and commercial development that bids fair to offer a fruitful field for British enterprise for many years to come. 7. The year 1935 may prove to be a critical one, as it will witness the departure of many of the British technical advisers who have hitherto given expert guidance to the public services. In a few instances their places will be taken by Iraqis who, though still young and inexperienced, may show themselves to be sufficiently capable successors. In many others serious gaps will be left and efficiency will suffer. Nevertheless, there is a steadily growing body of experienced officials who, if they are given freedom from capricious interference, should be capable of maintaining the public services at a sufficiently high standard to meet the essential requirements of the country. 8 . There are indications even among extreme nationalists of a growing 1 appreciation of the value of British advice and assistance, and Anglo-Iraqi relations have probably never before been so friendly and free from suspicion. II. —Foreign Relations. A fghanistan. Treaty of Friendship. 9. Ratifications of the Treaty of Friendship between Iraq and Afghanistan, which was signed on the 20th December, 1932, were exchanged at Tehran on the 11 th September. On that day King Ghazi received from the King of Afghanistan a friendly telegram, to which he returned a suitable reply. A ustria. 10 . Diplomatic relations were established between Austria and Iraq in October, when M. Carl Buchberger, Austrian Minister at Angora, paid a short visit to Bagdad and presented his credentials as Austrian Minister to King Ghazi. British Empire. United Kingdom.(f') 11 . The relations between His Majesty’s Embassy and the Iraqi Govern ment were excellent throughout the year. The total absence of sscy'^ the coolness that was evident in the summer of 1933 may perhaps be traced—at the beginning of the year at least—to a desire on the part of the Iraqi Government unostentatiously to make amends for the deplorable events of the Assyrian crisis of the preceding year. As the year closed, there can be no doubt that the frontier dispute with Persia brought home to many Iraqis—including some inveterate opponents of the alliance—a greater realisation of the extent to which Iraq is, and must for many years remain, dependent on the goodwill of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom for the maintenance of her newly acquired international status. 12. The points of friction arising out of the presence of the Royal Air Force (mentioned in last year’s report) disappeared; there was a great improvement in the relations between the military mission and the Iraqi army; numerous minor differences between His Majesty’s Embassy and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs were satisfactorily disposed of; and the Iraqi Government showed a general disposition to tackle earnestly the major questions outstanding with His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. (!) This section deals mainly with questions arising from the treaty of 30th June, 1930. In present circumstances any report on Iraq must be largely a recoid of relations with the United Kingdom. For a general conspectus of such relations, therefore, the report must be read as a whole.4 Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930. 13. Although the more extreme organs of the vernacular press did not cease during the year to inveigh against the alleged oppressive policy of the “ Imperialists,’’ specific attacks on the Anglo-Iraqi treaty of 1930 and demands for its revision became increasingly rare. 14. In April Dr. Abdullah Beg A1 Damluji, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, enquired whether there would be any objection to the publication, by the Iraqi Government, of certain explanatory notes regarding the treaty, which he had prepared and communicated to His Majesty’s Ambassador. These notes were founded on a selection of the unpublished correspondence which had passed between Sir Francis Humphrys and Nuri Pasha in 1930 and 1931. Taken as they were from their context, they did not give a complete or accurate explanation of the understanding which had been reached in the correspondence in question. It was, therefore, extremely doubtful whether publication would be in the public interest. In November His Majesty’s Ambassador informed the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would only agree to publication on the understanding that the correspondence relating to the treaty should be published in its entirety. By this time, however, the Cabinet had changed, and as no further reference was made to the subject, it seemed probable that the Iraqi Government had lost interest in it. His Majesty’s Ambassador accordingly recommended that discussion of the matter should not be reopened. British Officials. 15. The Iraqi Government continued during the year to utilise the services of Iraqi nationals in replacement of those British officials whose contracts were terminated, expired or were not renewed. Of these there were 32, but at the end of the year there were still 75( 2 ) British officials in the employment of the Iraqi Government. A large number of existing contracts are due to lapse in May 1935. It seems to be the settled policy of the Iraqi Government to dispense with the services of the more highly paid British officials with general administrative qualifications and to engage others with more strictly technical experience, on lower salaries. 16. At the beginning of the year the Council of Ministers approved the text of a revised form of contract, omitting all reference to the High Commissioner. The new conditions of service, though less favourable to the officials than the old, are generally justifiable in present circumstances. 17. No foreign officials other than British were recruited in 1934. Royal Air Force. 18. Voluminous correspondence passed between His Majesty’s Embassy and the Ministry fos* Foreign Affairs on a number of questions arising out of the presence of the Royal Air Force in Iraq—in particular the preparations for the construction of the new Royal Air Force air base at Dhibban. This corres pondence was conducted in the friendliest spirit throughout and on no point was it found impossible to reach a satisfactory agreement. 19. The difficulties which had arisen in the previous year regarding land used or required by the Royal Air Force as landing or training grounds were satisfactorily solved in February. The Iraqi Government accepted the view of His Majesty’s Embassy that, in these matters, they are still bound by their obligations under article 11 of the Financial Agreement attached to the treaty of 1922; and at the suggestion of the Minister for Foreign Affairs it was agreed that sites for which the Royal Air Force have applied since the coming into force of the new treaty should be settled between the Royal Air Force and the Iraqi Air Force direct. This arrangement has worked satisfactorily. Aerodrome Guards. 20 . In a note dated the 25th June the Ministry for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty’s Embassy that they were prepared to resume discussion of the measures necessary for the formation of the Air Defence Force in accordance with (2) Not including those in the Iraqi Railways (29) and the Port of Basra (32).if® [11315] b 3 S 5 the relevant provisions of the treaty of 1930. Though willing to take into consideration Nuri Pasha’s secret letter of the 30th June of that year, they denied that the Iraqi Government were bound by its contents, and were unwilling to admit the legitimacy of the continued maintenance of the levies as an aerodrome guard and an integral part of His Majesty’s forces in Iraq. In September Nuri Pasha (who had in the meantime become Minister for Foreign Affairs) was informed that these views were unacceptable to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. No written reply was sent to the Ministry’s note, since Nuri Pasha assured Mr. Ogilvie-Forbes that the present Government intended, at an early date, to introduce the legislation necessary to give effect to the secret letter. 21. In December His Majesty’s Ambassador informed Nuri Pasha that he was prepared to discuss a draft law at any time, without prejudice to the question of the date on which the change over from the levies to the Air Defence Force should take place. It is desirable that this should not be before the final settlement of the Assyrian question, since of the Assyrians, who still constitute the majority of the levies, those who cannot prove that they are of Iraqi nationality will not be eligible for the Defence Force, whilst those who are eligible will have to take the oath of allegiance to King Ghazi. Purchase of Stores in the United Kingdom. 22 . During the mandatory regime the Crown Agents for the Colonies acted as agents of the Iraqi Government for the purchase and inspection of stores in the United Kingdom; and on the termination of the mandate they consented to continue to act in this capacity as a temporary measure until such time as the Iraqi Goverment could devise an alternative system. The Iraqi Government, however, were unable to find any suitable alternative, and in January Nuri Pasha requested that the possibility of the Crown Agents continuing to act indefinitely for the Iraqi Government might be reconsidered. In May His Majesty’s Ambassador was authorised to inform the Iraqi Government that the Crown Agents were prepared to continue the purchase and inspection of stores for the Iraqi Government at certain stipulated rates of remuneration, which had been fixed on the assumption that all stores required by the Iraqi Government from the United Kingdom would be ordered through the Crown Agents. 23. The Iraqi Government were unwilling to commit themselves so completely to the Crown Agents, whom they blamed, erroneously, for the delays which had occurred in the delivery of certain military stores. Their failure to accept the offer of the Crown Agents or to follow any fixed procedure in placing their orders caused confusion. The whole question was accordingly discussed de novo by representatives of the two Governments, both in London and in Bagdad. 24. At the end of the year the Crown Agents for the Colonies made it clear that they could only deal with the Iraqi Government or with an Iraqi purchasing committee in London provided that all orders for non-military stores were placed with them. Arrangements whereby orders for military stores would be placed direct with the War Office and Air Ministry were under discussion at the end of the year. Supply to Iraq of Arms and Ammunition in Times of Urgent Need. 25. Neither His Majesty’s Government nor the Government of India were able to give an unconditional assurance that any definite quantities of arms and ammunition could be made available for the Iraqi Government from their own stocks at short notice in cases of urgent need. His Majesty’s Ambassador was, however, authorised to inform the Iraqi Government:— {a) On behalf of the Royal Air Force, that the numbers of bombs, &amp;c., and small arms ammunition required by the Iraqi Government in cases of urgent need would probably be available from Royal Air Force stocks in Iraq or in the United Kingdom. (h) On behalf of the War Office, that, in the event of an emergency to which article 4 of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of the 30th June, 1930, applied, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would be prepared to furnish the Iraqi Government from British stocks with the quantities of ammunition required for the Iraqi army provided that such quantities could be spared.6 Advisory Military Mission. 26. At the beginning of the year the British Advisory Military Mission consisted of two junior army and two junior air force officers only. The remaining ten had all left Iraq; some on the expiry of their contracts, and some on leave at the end of which their contracts were due to expire. The Iraqi Government maintained their refusal to apply for officers to fill the vacancies until the exact text of the revised conditions of service was finally settled. 27. As a result of repeated representations by His Majesty’s Ambassador they finally gave way, and by the autumn the cadre of the mission was once more complete. The first of the new officers to be appointed—Major-General C. J. Bruce Hay, the new head of the mission and Inspector-General of the Iraqi army —arrived in Iraq at the end of March. 28. It proved unexpectedly difficult to produce an agreed text of the revised conditions of service to be applied to the officers of the mission, and the negotia tions dragged on until the end of the year. 29. On the 20 th December notes were exchanged between His Majesty’s Ambassador and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, providing that the text on which agreement had, by then, been reached, should form the schedule to the contracts signed by the individual officers of the mission and the Minister of Defence. 30. The changes in the functions of the mission which had been suggested by the previous inspector-general, were approved at the beginning of the year and were brought into operation on the arrival of General Hay. Future of Iraqi Railways (see paragraph 208 of annual report for 1933). 31. It again proved impossible to reach agreement during the year regarding the terms of the draft law designed to set up an Iraqi Railway Corporation in accordance with clause 4 of the Financial Agreement appended to the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930. The period for the establishment of the corporation was accordingly extended by mutual agreement between the two Governments for a further year from October 1934. 32. On the 5th December the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed a letter to His Majesty’s Ambassador suggesting that, as a deadlock had been reached, the possibility of an alternative settlement on the basis of certain proposals, put forward privately and tentatively by the late King Faisal in London in 1933, should be discussed. This suggestion was referred to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, with a request for authority to accept an invitation, if made, by the Iraqi Government to open negotiations on a new basis. 33. In this connexion it is not irrelevant to note that opinions expressed both in Iraqi political milieux and in the press were, during 1934, more favourable than hitherto to the proposed construction of a railroad connecting Bagdad to Haifa. This change has come about mainly because the action of the Syrian authorities in extending their system to the Iraqi frontier is a visible | threat to the entrepot trade of Bagdad. Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Board. 34. In January His Majesty’s Ambassador communicated to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, at his request, an Arabic translation of the revised draft of the proposed tripartite convention to set up a Conservancy Board for the Shatt-el-Arab. But, owing to the persistent refusal of the Persian Government to admit the validity of the Iraqi-Persian frontier as delimited in 1914, no opportunity of discussing the proposed convention presented itself. Formal Agreements in the Course of Negotiation. 35 . Negotiations for the conclusion of a Civil Procedure Convention with the Iraqi Government continued during the year. On the 24th December His Majesty’s Embassy were able to communicate to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs[11315] b 4 7 the final English text of a draft, convention which would be acceptable to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, and there were indications that it would be possible to conclude the convention early in the new year. 36. In February His Majesty’s Embassy proposed to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs the conclusion of a War Graves Agreement to regularise, inter alia, the legal position of the Imperial War Graves Commission in Iraq. While assured of the sympathetic consideration of the Iraqi Government, they were informed that legislation would be necessary to give effect to such an agreement. Late in December, administrative and technical difficulties were foreseen to the proposals made by His Majesty’s Embassy, and means to overcome them were under consideration as the year closed. Proposed New Museum. 37. In March the Ministry for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty’s Embassy that the Iraqi Government wished to erect a new museum on a plot of land at Bagdad West, and requested that this site, measuring some 18 acres (the property of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, but under the control of the Iraqi Railways), should be made over to the Iraqi Government free of cost. This request was refused on the ground that the land in question would form a valuable asset of the Iraqi Railway Corporation, which was due to be established before the end of the year. The Iraqi Government pressed for a reconsideration of this decision on cultural grounds, and, in the course of discussions with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Director of Antiquities, His Majesty’s Ambassador ascertained that an area of 7f acres not required for railway purposes would be sufficient for the site. A proposal to hand over this portion of the land to the Iraqi Government free of cost was under consideration at the end of the year. Antiquities Law. 38. At the end of the 1933-34 season the Minister of Education once more attempted to create trouble by refusing to grant to Mr. Woolley (the director of the British Museum expedition at Ur) permission to export the share of the excavated objects allotted to him by the Director of xYntiquities, until he had satisfied himself regarding the division. This, besides being contrary to the existing practice, which the Iraqi Government had undertaken not to alter during the season, would have involved the unpacking and repacking of the various cases, which were ready for export. The Minister of Education gave way, however, on the intervention of King Ghazi and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to whom His Majesty’s Ambassador had made appropriate representations. 39. During the first half of the year the Iraqi Government proceeded with the preparation of a new draft Antiquities Law to supersede the law of 1924, and, at the end of July, the Director of Antiquities, with the consent of the Minister of Education, communicated a copy of the draft as it then stood to His Majesty’s Embassy. The Director of Antiquities had been consulted in the preparation of this draft, which was consequently less unfavourable to excavators than had at first been anticipated. The British Museum, however, considered that the terms of the draft were sufficiently severe to discourage foreign expeditions from coming to Iraq, and His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires communicated their views to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in a letter dated the 17th August. The Bill has not yet been presented to Parliament, and consequently it is not known whether any changes have been introduced into its text. The Minister of Education promised to study sympathetically the views expressed in Mr. Ogilvie-Forbes’s letter. 40. More important than the actual provisions of the Antiquities Law is the spirit in which they are applied, since even the law of 1924 gives the Director of Antiquities scope to cause serious embarrassment to excavators, if he is so minded. In the past the moderating influence of the German Director of Antiquities, Dr. Jordan, has done much to restrain the Iraqi authorities from “ nationalistic ” obstruction. Dr. Jordan’s contract was renewed in September, but, under his new contract, his position has been defined as “ Technical Adviser to the Department of Antiquities,” and he will have no executive power. This8 will be in the hands of one Sati Beg A1 Hasri, an Iraqi of Syrian origin, who has been appointed Director of Antiquities. He has no training or knowledge in the subject of archaeology, but the Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed His Majesty’s Ambassador that the Government will be guided by the advice of Dr. Jordan. 41. In the autumn of 1934 there seemed little reason to anticipate that the treatment accorded to expeditions working in Iraq during the coming season would be any worse than that accorded to foreign expeditions during the past few years, the British Museum took the view that conditions would not justify their sponsoring an expedition, and no British excavators came to Iraq for the 1934-35 season. This, however, was probably due to lack of funds. 42. In September three non-British expeditions were expected. India. Proposed Iraqi Consulate at Bombay. 43. In July the Iraqi Government sought, through His Majesty’s Embassy, the consent of the Government of India to the appointment of an Iraqi consul at Bombay. The reply of the Government of India was unfortunately delayed, as they found it necessary to consult His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. In December the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs were informed that the Government of India had no objection in principle to the establishment of a consulate at Bombay, provided that the Iraqi Government would exclude from the functions of their consular officer the visa-ing of pilgrim passes, and would continue to accept such passes without visa from pilgrims proceeding to or through Iraq. 44. A complaint made by the Iraqi Government in the summer against the rates of Indian customs duty on Iraqi produce is dealt with in section V of this report. Palestine. Proposed Iraqi Vice-Consulate at Haifa. 45. In August the Government of Palestine stated, in reply to an enquiry from the Iraqi Government, that they would have no objection to the establish ment of an Iraqi vice-consulate at Haifa. The Iraqi Government had, however, taken no steps to establish the proposed vice-consulate by the end of the year. Proposed Modus Vivendi regarding Transit Traffic. 46. In October 1933 His Majesty’s Embassy had informed the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs that, provided the Iraqi Government would give an undertaking that they would “ use their best endeavours to promote the develop ment of traffic by the Haifa-Bagdad route,” the Government of Palestine were prepared to offer free zone facilities for Iraqi goods at Haifa and to give, for a minimum period of three years, various additional advantages to the Iraqi Government with a view to promote trade along that route (see paragraph 265 of the annual report for 1933). In a note to His Majesty’s Embassy, dated the 24th April, the Iraqi Government gave this undertaking subject to the reserva tion, which had already been approved by the Government of Palestine, that they were unable to discriminate in favour of the Bagdad-Haifa route as against the other overland routes to the Mediterranean. They also transmitted a statement of specific measures for the development of transit traffic upon which they believed that they had reached agreement with the Government of Palestine. This statement, which was in the nature of a draft modus vivendi, needed considerable amendment, and points of detail were still under discussion at the end of the year. When agreement is finally reached, it is hoped that the modus vivendi will be brought into force by an exchange of notes between representatives of the two Governments. 47. Article 5 of the draft stipulates that it shall remain in force for an experimental period of three years, and that the question of its renewal for a further period shall be considered six months before the expiry of the experimental period, when the question of concluding a trade agreement between Palestine and Iraq shall be simultaneously considered.9 [11315] B 5 Transjordan. Proposed Customs and Travelling Agreements. 48. Negotiations for the conclusion of customs and travelling agreements between Transjordan and Iraq were carried on direct between the Governments of these two countries. In December the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty’s Ambassador that the Customs Agreement would be signed as soon as the draft had been approved by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. (Information regarding communications between Iraq and Transjordan will be found in Section VI of this report.) France. 49. With the death of King Faisal in September 1933 France’s chief enemy in Iraq was removed, and in August 1934, by agreeing to receive in Syria the dependants of those Assyrians already interned there, the French helped the Iraqi Government out of an embarrassing situation, and thus did much to soothe the indignation which their actions at the time of the Assyrian crisis had aroused in Iraq. It seemed, therefore, that there might be some prospect of an improvement in the relations between the two countries. But Iraq’s attitude towards France depends first and foremost on French policy in Syria. As the year progressed it became clear that France’s action in producing a draft treaty with Syria was no more than a gesture and that the French Government intended to make the objection taken by Syrian Nationalists to certain clauses of the draft the excuse for postponing indefinitely the grant of any form of independence to Syria. By the end of the year France had regained in Iraq whatever little she had lost of her reputation as the oppressors of £C brother Arabs.” Commercial A greement. 50. In July the French Government requested the good offices of His Majesty’s Government in order to assist them to reach agreement with regard to the conclusion of a Franco-Iraqi Commercial Agreement. Nothing further was heard of this proposal. Iraqi Legation in Paris. 51. An Iraqi Legation in Paris was opened in the autumn. The Legation will be in charge of a counsellor, but will be under the supervision of the Iraqi Minister in London, who is being accredited to the French Government. In November the post of counsellor was given to Ahmad Beg Qadri, brother of Tahsin Beg Qadri, the Master of Ceremonies. Italy. Iraqi Legation at Rome. 52. In the autumn the Iraqi Government decided to open a Legation in Rome, and in November Muzahim Beg A1 Pachaji, permanent representative of Iraq at the League of Nations, was appointed Minister at Rome also. Proposed Treaty of Friendship. 53. On his return from leave in the autumn, the Italian Charge d’Affaires at Bagdad brought with him a draft Treaty of Friendship between Italy and Iraq. Of the three main articles of this draft, the first provided for perpetual peace and friendship between the two countries, the second for diplomatic and consular representation on the basis of most-favoured-nation treatment and reciprocity, and the third for the pacific settlement of disputes by the conciliation procedure and arbitration. 54. At the end of December the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs communicated a copy of the draft treaty to His Majesty s Ambassador and informed him that he had accepted an invitation from Signor Mussolini to sign the treaty in Rome, on his way to Geneva. The treaty was to be accompanied by three notes for exchange between the two Governments, of which one would provide, with reference to article 2 of the treaty, for the perpetual precedence of His Majesty’s Ambassador in Iraq. On the 27th December, however, the Italian10 Charge d’Affaires at Bagdad addressed a memorandum to the Iraqi Government suggesting that such an exchange of notes was unnecessary, since the Italian Government had already recognised the Anglo-Iraqi treaty of 1030 and its annexes by their adhesion (cl) to the termination of the mandate, and (b) to the admission of Iraq into the League. He proposed that the Italian Legation at Bagdad should address an official note in the above sense to the Iraqi Ministry V; for &amp; Foreign Affairs and that the Iraqi Government should merely take note of it. These two documents would then repose in the dossier i elating to the negotiation of the treaty without forming an integral par t of it. 55 . The Iraqi Government referred this proposal to His Majesty’s Embassy, who replied that an exchange of notes in the sense suggested would adequately meet the case and need not form an integral part of the tieaty. The notes should, however, specifically refer to the treaty and be exchanged simultaneously with the signature thereof; and it would also be well if they were registered with the League of Nations. 56. In the event, Nuri Pasha decided, while he was at Angora, to proceed straight to Geneva without visiting Rome. He pleaded ill-health as the reason for this decision, but it is understood that he was informed in Angora that, by signing a treaty with Italy, Iraq would alienate Turkey. lor this icason he desired to postpone the signature of the treaty until after the Iiaqi-Peisian • dispute had been dealt with by the League of Nations. Koweit. Properties of the Sheikh of Koweit in Iraq. 57. The Sheikh of Koweit maintained throughout the year his plea of immunity from the jurisdiction of the Iraqi courts, and the Iraq Government, though unwilling to admit its validity, took no steps to set it aside. The claimants to the sheikh’s Faddaghiyah and Bashiyah estates were therefore unable to make any progress towards establishing their claims. Meanwhile, the Iraqi Government put forward tentative proposals for settling the Faddaghiyah case out of court, and for validating the sheikh’s title to that estate. These proposals were still under consideration at the end of the year. Revenue Exemption. 58. The situation created by the action of the Iraqi Government in collecting istihlak tax on the produce of the gardens in Iraq belonging to the Sheikh of Koweit and the former Sheikh of Mohammerah (which are covered by the promise of revenue exemption given on behalf of His Majesty’s Government in 1914) remained unchanged throughout the year. The Iraqi Government maintained their refusal to admit any responsibility for the fulfilment of this promise, and His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom were unable to reach any decision upon the question of compensating the sheikhs for their losses so long as the connected question of the title of the Sheikh of Koweit to his Faddaghiyah and Bashiyah estates remained unsettled. Both sheikhs submitted statements of the losses which they claimed to have sustained owing to the imposition of the istihlak tax. These statements were still under examination by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom at the end of the year. Fao Estate. 59. During the troubles which occurred on his Fao estate in 1933, the Sheikh of Koweit brought a number of lawsuits against cultivators who refused to surrender to him his proper share of the date crop, and in some of these cases the Basra courts decided that the sheikh should be requested to swear an oath to the effect that he had not received, from the defendants, the dates claimed. The Iraqi Government refused to forward to the sheikh the necessary documents to enable him to swear the oaths, adopting the attitude that, as he had refused to accept service of documents relating to cases pending against him in the Iraqi courts, no legal documents emanating from Iraqi courts could be served upon him. He must therefore accept service of all or of no such documents. It was obviously out of the question for the sheikh to attend the court in person, and it therefore seemed probable that the cases, which were due to be heard'on the11 [11315] b 6 29th October, might be decided against him owing to his failure to swear the oaths. This danger was, however, averted through the intervention of His Majesty’s Embassy, who persuaded the Iraqi Government to order the postpone ment of the hearing of the cases for four months, whilst the important questions of principle raised by the attitude adopted by the Iraqi Government were under discussion. This was the position at the end of the year. Smuggling. 60. Arrangements were made at the beginning of the year for a conference to be held at Bagdad on the 15th February between representatives of Iraq and Koweit to discuss the frontier relations between the two countries and, in particular, the question of smuggling from Koweit into Iraq. At the last moment the Sheikh of Koweit refused to give his representatives proper authority, and the conference had to be postponed indefinitely. There were no further developments until July, when the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf informed a meeting, attended by certain of the British advisers to the Iraqi Government and members of His Majesty’s Embassy, of the proposals which the sheikh had at last been induced to make with the object of restricting smuggling by sea. These proposals proved to be of doubtful practicability and it was clear that there was no hope of their bein^ acceptable to the Iraqi Government, mainly because, as most of the smuggling is done by land, they only touched upon the fringe of the problem. On the 23rd September an informal Iraqi delegation, consisting of the Iraqi Director-General for Foreign Affairs and the Mutessarif of Basra, visited Koweit, and on their arrival they communicated to the Acting Political Resident the following proposals :— ( 1 ) The Sheikh of Koweit should give an undertaking to prevent smuggling. ( 2 ) To give effect to this undertaking, one of the following measures should be adopted :— (a) The Iraqi tariff should be applied in Koweit with the technical advice of the Iraqi customs authorities, or (b) The management of the Koweiti customs should be placed in the hands of Iraqi customs officials in the employ of the Sheikh of Koweit and imports should be limited. (3) That in either case compensation should be paid to the sheikh. 61. The sheikh declined to discuss these suggestions unless he could be supplied with full details of a technical nature, which the Iraqi delegates were unable to furnish; nor would he avail himself of their offer to discuss any alternative proposals which he might wish to put forward. The visit, therefore, bore no practical result. Moreover, as a result of subsequent correspondence, it became clear that the sheikh was not willing to offer or to accept any suggestions which went further than those which had been tentatively put forward on his behalf by Colonel Fowle in July. 62. By November a deadlock had again been reached. At the beginning of December the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty’s Ambassador that he despaired of arriving at any understanding with the sheikh and asked whether His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom could not deal direct with the Iraqi Government in the matter, agree upon a settlement which seemed to them fair and reasonable, and then urge its acceptance on the sheikh. If the sheikh rejected conditions of which His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom had approved, he would not be entitled to complain if the Iraqi Government applied pressure. Nuri Pasha made it abundantly clear that, as Koweiti smuggling was having an increasingly serious effect on the revenues and prestige of Iraq, the Iraqi Government would, failing a satisfactory agree ment, be forced to resort to extreme measures, which might include a total blockade of Koweit. At the end of the year Nuri Pasha’s request was still under consideration by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. Frontier Incidents. 63. The atmosphere in which the discussions, recorded above, took place was not improved by a number of regrettable incidents which were said to have12 occurred during the year near the Iraq—Koweit frontier. In April and October Iraqi customs officers were alleged to have fired without reason upon Koweiti dhows in Koweiti territorial waters. In May and August Iraqi desert police were reported to have made incursions into Koweiti territory. 64. In each case appropriate representations were made by His Majesty’s Embassy to the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs, but they served little purpose other than that of record, since, in their replies, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs gave different accounts of the incidents, according to which the Iraqi customs and police officers never entered Koweiti territory or territorial waters, and the Koweitis concerned were always engaged in smuggling. 65. It is, in present circumstances, impossible to establish the truth concerning these incidents. In December, however, Nuri Pasha undertook to see that stringent and precise orders were issued to the police and customs to avoid all activities which might give rise to complaint, especially while the discussions regarding future policy are in progress. A ttacks on Koweit in Iraqi Press. 66 . During the first quarter of the year a number of tendentious articles regarding Koweit appeared in the Iraqi vernacular press. At the end of March King Ghazi and the Minister for Foreign Affairs promised to take steps to prevent their repetition, and since that date only one such article has, in fact, been brought to the notice of His Majesty’s Embassy. Post and Telegraph Services in Koweit. 67. No progress was made during the year in the negotiations to settle the future of the Post and Telegraph Office in Koweit, and for various reasons it is unlikely that any further attempt will be made in the near future by His Majesty’s Government or the Sheikh of Koweit to alter the existing state of affairs or in any way to regularise the position of the office. League of Nations. Bahai Houses. 68 . The Bagdad Town Planning Scheme has been indefinitely shelved and, although the Iraqi Government are proposing to expropriate a number of houses in Bagdad West in order to make room for the construction of a suitable approach to the new bridge which is eventually to replace the present Kotah Bridge, the Bahai Houses are not situated in the area concerned, and their expropriation for the public benefit cannot, therefore, be effected as part of this scheme. His Majesty’s representative reminded the Minister for Foreign Affairs on more than one occasion of the obligations of the Iraqi Government in this matter. 69. The reference to the League of Iraq’s frontier dispute with Persia is dealt with in paragraphs 72-81 below. Persia. General. 70. The “ accord provisoire ” of August 1929 between Iraq and Persia was extended on the 11 th February, and again on the 11 th August, for a further period of six months on each occasion. 71. The new Persian Minister at Bagdad, Inayatullah Khan Sami’i, presented his credentials to King Ghazi on the 14th January. Iraqi-Persian Frontier. 72. On the 4th November, 1913, representatives of the Ottoman Empire and of Persia, and of Great Britain and Russia in their capacity of mediating Powers, signed a protocol describing the line which the frontier between the Ottoman Empire and Persia was to follow and providing for the setting up of a delimitation commission to carry out its actual demarcation. Article 5 of the protocol specifically laid down that, as soon as any part of the frontier had been delimited by this commission, that part should be held to have been finally fixed13 [HSifi] B 7 and should not be open either to subsequent examination or to revision. The delimitation was carried out by the commission in 1914, and it is the view of the Iraqi Government that the frontier between Persia and that part of the Ottoman Empire which forms the modern State of Iraq was finally fixed by this delimitation. 73. The present frontier leaves to Iraq all the waters of the Shatt-el-Arab except in one or two specified reaches where Persia has anchorages, notably at Mohammerah. The Persian Government, who regard this position as unsatis factory and desire either the thalweg or the medium filuin aquce to constitute the boundary along the Shatt, now refuse to recognise the frontier as delimited in 1914, and since 1931 have been disregarding it in practice by a series of violations ; which can be summarised under the following three headings :— ( 1 ) The erection and maintenance of a number of police posts within Iraqi territory. (2) Disregard of the regulations made by the Directorate of the Port of Basra to govern the navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab. (3) The cutting off of supplies of water on which villages in Iraq, especially in the Khanaqin area, depend for their maintenance. 74. Protests from the Iraqi Government either were ignored or met with the reply that the places concerned were in Persian territory. Until 1934 the Persian Government never challenged the validity of the 1914 frontier in writing, but their representatives in conversation with representatives of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and of the Iraqi Government left little doubt as to their attitude, which they attempted to justify by the following arguments :— ( 1 ) That the protocol of 1913 was never ratified. (2) That the work of the Delimitation Commission was interrupted by the war, and that a small section of the frontier between Persia and that part of the Ottoman Empire which now forms modern Turkey was never delimited. (3) That the boundary between Turkey and Persia, settled in agreement between the two States, does not follow exactly the line laid down in 1913, Persia being the loser. (4) That it is contrary to international practice for all the waters of a river forming the boundary between two States to belong to one of those States. 75. In 1932 conversations which took place at Tehran during the visits of His Majesty’s High Commissioner and King Faisal gave some hope that the establishment of the proposed Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Board, on which the Persian Government, as well as His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Iraqi Government, would be represented, would satisfy the aspirations of the Shah. But following on the termination of the mandatory regime in Iraq, the attitude of the Persian Government stiffened, and it soon became clear that such a solution would never be voluntarily accepted by them. 76. In 1934 the Persian Government at last came out into the open. In March the Iraqi Charge d’Affaires received from the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs, in reply to a protest made the previous year, a note in which it was stated that the Persian Government “ does not acknowledge the official nature of the boundary demarcation protocol of 1914 and cannot consider the text of the said protocol as a basis and authority for the definition and fixing of the alignment of the boundary between the two Governments.” In reply, the Iraqi Government, after consulting His Majesty’s Embassy, set out their reasons for considering the frontier as demarcated in 1914 to be valid and binding, and added that on this basis they were willing to resume in a spirit of friendship the discussion of the various treaties and agreements which had previously formed the subject of negotiation, subject to the condition that such negotiations should not lead to any infringement' of the sovereign rights of Iraq. No reply was received to this proposal. 77. Discussions between the Iraqi and Persian Ministers for Foreign Affairs at Geneva in September, and again at Bagdad in October, led to no14 agreement, and the fact that, while these discussions were actually in progress, yet another Persian police post was established in Iraqi territory (at Kani Sukht in the Kut Liwa) did not help to convince INuri Pasha of the genuineness of the desire of the Persian Government for an amicable settlement. 78. At the end of the year the Iraqi Government lost patience, and at the beginning of December they addressed a note to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations setting out all the circumstances of the dispute and requesting that the matter should be placed on the agenda for the next session of the Council. A copy of this note was communicated to the Persian Government by the Iraqi Government, who explained that their action was due to no unfriendly feeling but to a desire to eradicate once and for all a cause of misunderstanding between the two countries. It was not intended to close the door upon any proposals for a direct settlement. In reply, the Persian Government stated that they recognised and reciprocated the friendly tone of the 1 raqi demarche, and added that, whilst they would still welcome immediate direct negotiations, they would acquiesce in the submission of the question to the Council of the League if the Iraqi Government considered this desirable. The question was placed on the provisional agenda for the January session of the Council, and at the end of December Nuri Pasha left Bagdad for Geneva to represent Iraq. 79. Although the Iraqi Government had been informed in the summer that, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, their case was legally unassailable, they took the step of appealing to the League on their own initiative. But in November His Majesty’s Ambassador was authorised to inform the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in reply to an enquiry, that, in the event of the Iraqi Government deciding that it would be useless to pursue further direct negotiations with the Persian Government and that the time had come to appeal to the League of Nations, the United Kingdom delegation at Geneva would give the Iraqi Government all such proper help and support as lay within their power. 80 In December His Majesty’s Embassy were privately informed by the Iraqi Director-General for Foreign Affairs that the Persian Minister at Bagdad had made it clear that Persia’s claim to half the Shatt-el-Arab was only part of the Shah’s plan to evict the British from the Persian Gulf once and for all, and that, if Iraq would accommodate the Persians by giving them half the Shatt, the Persians would willingly agree to a practical c&lt; navigation ” arrangement, provided His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom had no part in it. Dr. Naji Beg replied that this proposal could never be put into practice so long as Iraq adhered to the Treaty of Alliance of 1930, and that Iraq had no intention of abandoning that treaty. 81. There have not been wanting other indications that Persia’s claim to half the Shatt is only part of their general offensive against British influence in the Gulf. The A uromani Kurds. 82. In the spring the Persian Government resumed their operations against the Auromani Kurds (see paragraph 43 of the annual report for 1932), many of whom took refuge in Iraqi territory. Fortunately, they displayed no hostility to the Iraqi forces, which were drafted into the Halabja area to assist the local authorities, and thirty-six were arrested without difficulty and interned at Sulaimaniyah. They were subsequently treated as political prisoners in the same way as Jafar Sultan, the head of the tribe, who gave himself up to the Iraqi authorities in 1932, and during the year under review resided under supervision at Ram ad i. 83. The Persian Government complained to the Iraqi Government that the Iraqi authorities, if not actually encouraging the Auromanis, were at any rate failing to afford adequate help to the Persian authorities in their efforts to round them up. This complaint appears to have been entirely unjustified and prompted solely by the desire of the Persian Government to find a grievance to set against the protests of the Iraqi Government against Persian violation of the frontier./ [11315] b 8 15 Saudi Arabia. 84. In a letter dated the 5th February, Ibn Sand expressed to His Majesty’s Ambassador his pleasure at the increasing friendliness of the relations between Saudi Arabia and Iraq. In spite of this, the usual crop of rumours regarding alleged anti-Saudi intrigues of the Hashimite family reached the ears of Ibn Saud and his Government during the first half of the year, and were duly passed on to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom for investigation. Inevitably these rumours could be neither verified nor categorically denied. 85. During his visit to London in September Fuad Bey Hamza, Deputy Saudi Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs, enquired tentatively how His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would view a “ tightening up ” of the relations between Iraq and Saudi Arabia. On this occasion Fuad Bey Hamza did not explain the exact nature of the proposals of his Government; but it is understood that before leaving London he proposed to the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, who was also on a visit there, the conclusion of a Treaty of Alliance between Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and that he also made suggestions for the conclusion of a commercial agreement and of a convention according to Saudi subjects Iraqi consular protection. In October Nuri Pasha assured His Majesty’s Charge d‘Affaires that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would, in due course, be consulted, and that he would make it clear to the Saudi Govern ment that Iraq would not be a party to any alliance contrary to the Treaty of Alliance of 1930, or detrimental to the interests of other Arab States. Nothing more was heard of the matter before the end of the year. 86 . The negotiations for a pilgrim route between Najaf and Medina are described in Section VI of this report. Saudi- Yemeni War. 87. The Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Yemen addressed two telegrams to the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs, dated the 2nd May and the 10 th May respectively, stating that he was seeking the mediation of States with which the Yemen was in treaty relations to end the war with Ibn Saud. The Iraqi Govern ment, who felt that, as the only independent Arab State member of the League of Nations, they ought to do everything possible to end fratricidal Arab strife, asked His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom whether a similar appeal had been made to them, and, if so, what action Iraq could properly take in concert with other States. They were informed that similar telegrams had been received in London, but that nothing was to be gained by an attempt at mediation. Saudi Charge d'Affaires in Bagdad. 88 . In August the Iraqi Government became dissatisfied with the conduct . of the Saudi Charge d’Affaires at Bagdad, who had made speeches at Kerbala and Najaf in praise of Ibn Saud and offensive to Shiah sentiment. In taking this matter up with the Saudi Government, the Iraqi Charge d’Affaires exceeded his instructions and presented a note couched in discourteous language, in which he demanded the recall of the Saudi Charge d’Affaires. Ibn Saud objected to the terms of this note and informed His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Jedda that, should the Iraqi Government persist in their incivility, he would request them to recall their representative at Jedda. 89. It is understood that this dispute was satisfactorily settled as a result of correspondence between the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs and Ibn Saud’s private secretary. At any rate, the Saudi Charge d’Affaires was still in Bagdad at the end of the year. Sweden. 90. Baron Eric Gyllenstierna, Swedish Minister at Moscow, presented his cicdentials as Swedish Minister to Iraq on the 16th October. The reason for the appointment of a Swedish Minister in Bagdad was the State visit, which the Crown Prince and Crown Princess of Sweden paid to King Ghazi in November. Their Royal Highnesses, accompanied by Princess Ingrid and Prince Bertil, reached Bagdad on the 1st November and stayed until the 6 th November, when they left for Persia. They were accommodated' in an annexe of the King’s palace16 al Bagdad North, which had been specially constructed foi the occasion, and all the arrangements for their entertainment, which were modelled on the ceremonial of the Court of St. James, were admirably carried out. Ihe Royal party stayed for a few days in Bagdad on their return from Persia on the 27th November. This second visit was informal and was spent mostly in the exploration of the vV more interesting archseological sites in Iraq. Syria. 91. At the end of May, a Syrian delegation visited Bagdad in order to discuss with representatives of the Iraqi Government a number of incidents which had occurred on the Iraq-Syria frontier during the past year. Agreement was reached on one or two minor matters, but the most important result of the meetings was the decision that a more formal conference should take place at Palmyra on the 11th October to settle once and for all outstanding tribal disputes on the frontier. This conference was duly held with, it is understood, satisfactory results. His Majesty’s Embassy had not, before the end of the year, been able to obtain a copy of the proceedings. 92. In July, when the Iraqi Government were pressing the French Govern ment to receive in Syria the dependents of those Assyrians who were already interned there, the French tried to make it a condition that Iraq should undertake to hold an economic conference with Syria in the winter with a view to the conclusion of commercial and “ bon-voisinage ” agreements between the two countries; and a draft “ bon-voisinage ” agreement was communicated to the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs by the French Charge d’Affaires at Bagdad. When M. Lepissier reverted to this subject in the autumn, the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that, while in the interests of peace and good order he was prepared to enter into temporary local or departmental agreements, he would not negotiate any instrument which would have to be submitted to Parliament unless and until France honoured her undertakings made publicly on various occasions to grant independence to Syria. In the opinion of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom this attitude is unjustifiable— (a) because the French authorities are the actual administrators of Syria and any agreement regarding Syria must necessarily, under existing circumstances, be concluded with them or under their auspices; and (b) because the proposals of the League Commission for the determination of the Syria-Iraq frontier, which were embodied in the Council’s resolution of the 3rd October, 1932, included a recommendation that the authorities concerned should conclude special agreements for the regulation of frontier relations. Moreover, when that resolution was adopted the heads of a “ bon-voisinage ” agreement, drawn up under the auspices of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, had already been signed by Nuri Pasha, and an announcement to that effect had been made to the Council. 93. At the end of the year His Majesty’s Ambassador was instructed to use his influence to dissuade Nuri Pasha from continuing his previous policy towards the French mandatory authorities, and to encourage him to proceed with the negotiation at an early date of a “ bon-voisinage ” agreement, which would be in accordance with what was the evident intention of the signatories of the heads of agreement of 1932. Turkey. Commercial Treaty. 94. The ratifications of the Turco-Iraqi Commercial Treaty, signed at Angora on the 10th January, 1932, were exchanged on the 8 th May by the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Turkish Minister Plenipotentiary at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Bagdad. Barzan. 95. Ihe trouble caused to the Iraqi Government by the outlaw Khalil Khoshawi was considerably aggravated by the fact that his base was in Turkish territory and the Turkish authorities made no attempt to take measures against17 [11315] b 9 him or in any way to curtail his activities. But it is probable that this was due not to any ill-will on the part of the Turkish Government, but to the fact that the local'Turkish authorities on the frontier had an agreement with Khalil Khoshawi whereby they received a share of any loot obtained in Iraq. Visit of Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs to Angora. 96. During the last days of the year the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs paid a visit to Angora on his way to Geneva. The two objects of Nuri Pasha s visit to Europe were (1) to represent Iraq before the Council of the League in connexion with the Iraqi-Persian frontier dispute, and (2) to sign at Rome a treaty of friendship between Iraq and Italy. His discussions with Turkish Ministers were mainly concerned with these two questions. 97. As regards the frontier dispute with Persia, the Turks were carefully non-committal, hut Nuri Pasha appears to have been impressed by the anti-Italian feeling which prevails at Angora (see paragraph 54 above). United States of America. Extradition Treaty. 98. An extradition treaty between Iraq and the United States of America was signed at the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs on the 7th June by the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs and the American Minister at Bagdad. Treaties Signed or Ratified between Iraq and Foreign States during 1934. 99. Treaty of Friendship between Iraq and Afghanistan, signed the 20th December, 1932. Ratified at Tehran the 11th September, 1934.( 3 ) Turco-Iraqi Commercial Treaty, signed at Angora the 10th January, 1932. Ratified at Bagdad the 8 th May, 1934. Extradition Treaty between Iraq and the United States of America, signed the 11 th June, 1934. Not yet ratified. International Agreements and Conventions. 100. Laws authorising the Iraqi Government to accede to the following international conventions were passed on the dates noted hereunder : Date of Enabling Law. ( 1 ) The International Convention for Limiting the Manufacture and Regulating the Distribution of Narcotic Drugs (Geneva, July 1931) (2) The International Agreement for the Creation of an International Office of Public Health (Rome, December 1907) (3) Protocols dated the 15th June, 1929, and the Uth December, 1929, relating to the amend ment of articles 3, 5, 7, 15, 34, 37 and 42 and to articles 34 and 40 respectively of the Convention governing Air Navigation of the 13th October, 1919 (4) The International Convention relating to the Amelioration of the Conditions of the Wounded and Sick in Armies in the Field (Geneva, July 1929) (5) The International Convention for the Treatment of Prisoners of War (Geneva, July 1929) January 29, 1934 January 29, 1934 April 30, 1934 August 6 , 1934 August 30, 1934 The Iraqi Government have also acceded to the International Convention and Statute (signed at Geneva in July 1927) establishing an International Relief Union. Their adhesion was registered at Geneva on the 12th June, 1934. (3) In last year’s annual report it was erroneously stated that this treaty was ratified on 13th May, 1933. This was merely the date of the law enabling the King of Iraq to ratify.18 III.—Internal Affairs (Political). The King. 101 . The marriage of King Ghazi to his cousin, the Princess Aliyah, ^ daughter of King Ali, was solemnised on the 25th January. Owing to Court mourning following upon the death of his father, King Faisal, the ceremony was entirely private, and was attended only by members of the Poyal Family and close family friends. Personal telegrams of congratulation were received from His Majesty King George, the Kings of Italy and Saudi Arabia and the Presidents of the French, German and Turkish Republics. The President of the United States of America also sent an appropriate message through the American Minister in Bagdad. 102. In April His Majesty toured the southern provinces, visiting the holy cities of Karbala and Najaf, and also Diwaniyah, Nasariyah and Basra. The tour passed off without untoward incident, and the King expressed himself as well pleased with the welcome which he had received. Many of the tribal sheikhs, however, contrasted his aloofness with the understanding, sympathy and friendliness which has always been shown to them by his father. 103. In June His Majesty carried out an extensive tour in the north. He first visited Mosul, where he opened the new steel bridge over the Tigris and laid the foundation-stone of a new civil hospital. From Mosul His Majesty went on to Arbil, Kirkuk and Sulaimani, returning to Bagdad after an absence of just over a week. This tour was not the success that it might have been. Many gatherings of tribesmen who had assembled to welcome the King were sent away disappointed because of the constant changes made in the Royal programme, and even those who came in contact with His Majesty were unfavourably impressed by their perfunctory reception. It is greatly to be regretted that during the past year there was no-one in the King’s entourage with sufficient wisdom or savoir-faire to ensure that his visits to the provinces were conducted in a manner more likely to enhance his popularity among his people. 104. Late in November Rustam Beg Haidar was reappointed to the important post of Rais of the Royal Hi wan (principal private secretary). He held this position with success for many years under the late King Faisal, and it may be hoped that he will be able to improve the manner in which King Ghazi’s public appearances are organised and to reform the internal arrangements of the Diwan, which were becoming chaotic. King Ali. 105. King Ali left Bagdad for Amman on the 14th May. After spending a few days with his brother, the Amir Abdullah, he went to Europe, accompanied by his private doctor, Dr. Husaini, and the Amir Adil Arslan, the Druse exile from Syria. In late August he returned to Amman, and six weeks later again took up residence in Bagdad. While in Europe King Ali visited Rome, and is reported to ha\e had conversations with persons in authority regarding the possibility of Italian intervention in Arabian affairs. It is extremely unlikely, however, that these conversations led to any practical results. Parliament. 106. The session which opened on the 1 st November, 1933, was prolonged for one month by Royal iradah on the 24th March and was prorogued on the 29th April, the principal enactments, apart from the budget and laws enabling the Iiaqi Go\ eminent to accede to treaties and international instruments, were \— (a) National Defence Law. (h) Reserve (Army) Service Law. (c) Amendments to the Press Law. (d) Law for the Development of Capital Works. (e) Customs Tariff Law. (/) Law amending the Salt Monopoly.19 [11315] B 10 (&lt;/) Amendments to the Law governing the Expropriation of Immovable Property. (h) Law amending the Criminal Procedure Regulations. (i) Law establishing an Iraqi Diplomatic and Consular Service. (j) Amendments to the Weights and Measures Law. (k) Amendments to the Census Law. (/) Law for the recognition of the Iraqi Red Crescent Society. (m) Amendments to the Income Tax Law. Where necessary, these acts are discussed under their appropriate headings in this report. The Dissolution. 107. On the 5th September, following the formation of Ali Jaudat’s Cabinet in late August, the King dissolved Parliament. The Chamber elected in February 1933 had contained a large number of Nuri Pasha’s personal supporters, and the Prime Minister and the other members of the new Cabinet felt that when Parliament reassembled the confidence of the Chamber would depend too much on Nuri Pasha’s goodwill. They accordingly advised the King that a general election was a necessary condition of their continuance in office. At the close of the year, there were indications that the Senate were prepared to maintain that the dissolution had been unconstitutional and unnecessary. The Elections. 108. The elections were carried out without incident and without public interest. The final polling took place on the 6 th December. All members of the Cabinet were returned with the exception of Nuri Pasha and Abdul Husain Chalabi, both of whom are Senators. Of the 88 Deputies elected, 44 had sat in the last Chamber, 23 had been Deputies at some previous time and 21 were new to parliamentary life. Taken as a whole, the new Chamber differed very little in composition from those which had preceded it. 109. On the day following the final poll, the formation of a new party— the Party of National Unity—was announced. This is intended to be the party of Ali Jaudat’s Cabinet. Like previous similar parties, it is, in fact, little more than a group of Deputies and has no organisation outside the Chamber. Its fate will probably be not unlike that of the Ahd-al-Iraqi, which was founded by Nuri Pasha when he became Prime Minister in 1930 and ceased to exist when he resigned the premiership in October 1932. Opening of Parliament. 110. The King opened Parliament on the 29th December. In the Speech from the Throne he referred to the frontier dispute with Persia and affirmed the willingness of the Iraqi Government to negotiate a settlement directly with the Persian Government, should the latter so desire. His Majesty also informed the new Parliament that the Government hoped to lay before them legislation embodying schemes for improving the organisation of the Law Courts and for increasing the number of primary schools. The Cabinet. 111 . At the beginning of the year Jamil Beg A1 Madfai was at the head of the Government, supported by the Cabinet which he had formed in the preceding November. His colleagues were, however, never happy as a team, and about the middle of February their mutual differences forced him to resign. The King, fearing the personal ambition of both Nuri Said and Yasin-al-Hashimi, was reluctant to call upon either to form a Government, and persuaded Jamil-al- Madfai to resume office with a new Cabinet formed on non-party lines. Jamil Beg chose as his colleagues the following Ministers :— Foreign Affairs: Abdullah Damluji. Finance : Naji Suwaidi. Defence : Rashid Khoja, Justice : Jamal Baban. Economics and Communications : Abbas Mahdi. Education : Jallal Baban.20 The new Cabinet assumed office on the 21 st February. 1 he programme which the Prime Minister presented to the Chamber two days later contained little that was new and calls for no detailed record. In July Abdullah Damluji resigned, and shortly afterwards again became Director of Health Services, his place at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs being taken by Taufiq-al-Suwaidi, formerly Iraqi delegate at Geneva. 112 . The Cabinet itself was, however, already on its last legs. Most of the Ministers were dissatisfied with the inept leadership of Jamil-al-Madfai, and the inclusion of two Suwaidis had made the Government generally unpopular. Nuri Pasha, tired of being out of office, saw his opportunity, joined forces with Ali Jaudat, the King’s principal private secretary, and by tortuous intrigues brought about the Prime Minister’s fall. He resigned on the 26th August, and on the following day Royal iradahs were issued appointing the following Cabinet:— Prime Minister and Minister for the Interior : Ali Jaudat-al-Ayubi. Minister for Finance : Yusuf-al-Ghanimah. Minister for Foreign Affairs : Nuri-al-Said. Minister for Justice: Jamal Baban. Minister for Defence: Jamil Madfai. Minister for Economics and Communications : Arshad-al-Umari. Minister for Education : Abdul Husain Chalabi. Their programme was as colourless as that of their predecessors and passed almost unnoticed even in the Arabic press. 113. No other Cabinet changes occurred up to the end of the year. The Assyrians. 114. Throughout the year the Special Committee of the League of Nations, set up by resolution of the Council in October 1933, continued its endeavours to find a suitable territory in which to resettle the ex-Ottoman Assyrians now in Iraq. At first, their enquiries and negotiations concerned the vast estates of the Parana Plantations Company in Brazil. Early in January the Brazilian Government intimated that they were prepared to admit the Assyrians in groups of 500 families per month on the understanding that the company would provide for their settlement. Encouraged by this decision, the committee despatched a special Commission of Enquiry to examine the Parana territory on the spot and to report on its suitability for Assyrian settlement. The report of this commission was on the whole favourable, but a general decision taken in May by the Government of Brazil to restrict all immigration into that country made it impossible to proceed any further with the Parana scheme. This was a most disappointing development, but the Council Committee set about their work de novo and sent urgent appeals to the Governments of a number of States, asking for their assistance in finding a new home for the Assyrians. Most of the replies iecei\ed were unfavourable, but the Governments of the LFnited Kingdom and France made proposals for the settlement of the Assyrians respectively in British Guiana and on the Niger in French West Africa. The committee decided to send a Commission of Enquiry to British Guiana to report on the suitability of the territory olieied by the Government of the Colony for Assyrian settlement. This commission, which consisted of Brigadier-General Browne, formerly Commandant of the Assyrian Levies in Iraq, and M. Guidi Renzo Giglioli, an Italian expert on agriculture, left Europe for British Guiana in October. Their full lepoit had not been leceived before the close of the year, but the preliminary i epoi t received by telegiam at the end of December did not encourage the hope that any large-scale settlement of Assyrians in the Colony would prove feasible. 115. Following the Brazilian Government’s enactment of the new immigiation laws lefeii ed to above, which finally killed all hope of findin 0, a new home foi the Assyiians in the Parana territory, it became evident that much time must elapse before an alternative scheme could be formulated. The Iraqi Government consequently found it necessary to revise the temporary arrange ments which had been adopted to deal with the chaotic conditions which had followed the massacres of the summer of 1933. The three main problems whichIS3 21 they had to face were (a) the disposal of the families of those Assyrian men who had gone to and remained in Syria; (b) the liquidation of the Mosul camp for destitutes (for the indefinite maintenance of which there was no adequate financial provision); and (c) the re-establishment on the land of those who had abandoned cultivation in the belief that they were soon to be removed to another country. 116. As regards (a), agreement was ultimately reached (after lengthy negotiations) with the French authorities for the transfer to Syria of 1,507 dependants of these men, the Iraqi Government paying a lump sum of £ 10,000 to meet the cost of their temporary accommodation pending a final decision by the League of Nations regarding their future. The transfer to Syria began on the 1 st September. With the exception of 100 persons, who were sent over early in November, all had been transported without mishap by the middle of the month. On arrival, they were established (together with some 500 men of the original exodus) in two settlements on the upper reaches of the Khabur River, in the Syrian Jazirah. These settlements were placed under the direction of a representative of the Nansen Office for Refugees. 117. With regard to (b )—the Mosul camp for destitutes—the Iraqi Govern ment, led by the Prime Minister, Jamil-al-Madfai, at first proposed the wholly unconscionable course of closing it down and expelling its inmates. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires and the adviser to the Ministry of the Interior succeeded, how ever, after a stiff tussle, in preventing this, and persuaded the Government to set up a committee to examine the whole matter carefully and prepare detailed It was then found on analysis that after the transfer to Syria of some persons from the camp, the remainder could be classified as follows : :— Category. M en. Women. Children. Total. (a) Persons having no supporters ... 136 170 306 (b) Old and infirm or invalid persons 36 27 37 100 (c) Persons with able-bodied men in the camp ... 16 23 39 (d) Persons with male supporters in Iraq 83 127 210 Total 36 262 357 655 Adopting, in the main, the recommendations of their committee, the Iraqi Govern ment on the 6 th September decided that, while the camp should be maintained for persons in categories (a) and (b), those in (c) and (d) should be given a cash grant of £4 per adult and £2 per child and be required to join their male relatives. This was a fair—even generous—offer, but unfortunately a strong local agitation against these proposals was organised by the patriarchal clique, who have con sistently endeavoured to thwart any plans for dealing with the Assyrians which did not further Mar Shimun’s political ambitions. In consequence the majority of the persons in categories (c) and (d) at first refused to accept the cash grant, and many had to be forced to leave the camp by the stoppage of their rations. Ultimately, only twenty-two women with forty-eight children, all in category (d), took the money offered. Thus many were deprived of monetary assistance,^of which they were greatly in need. On the other hand, a number of persons in categories (a) and ( 5 ), although eligible to stay in the camp, applied to leave under the terms offered to categories (c) and (d). Double rates were paid to these persons, and 8 men, 18 women and 19 children of these two categories left the camp after receiving grants on this scale. All those, of whatever category, who left, were allowed to take with them all the clothing and bedding which had been supplied to them during their stay. At the close of the year about 370 women and children remained in the camp, all accommodated in houses. 118. To cope with the problem mentioned under (c) above, the Government, as a fresh inducement to resume cultivation, offered a grant of £7 per family for seed, oxen and implements, and £ 1 ^ per family for repairs to houses to all those prepared to return to work on the land. Nearly 300 families applied for and received this grant. 119. In Mosul town, however, there were still, at the end of the year, approximately 1,200 Assyrian men, women and children who had fled there [11315] ' b 1122 following the disturbances of the summer of 1933. Most of these were out of work and dependent on the charity of others more fortunately situated than themselves, and on subscriptions raised for them by the serving levies. In Diana and the Harir plain (Rowanduz district) the Assyrians were also in a difficult position. Although quite untouched by the troubles of 1933, they allowed much of the land which they previously cultivated to pass out of their hands, in the unwarranted belief that they would soon be leaving the country. Consequently, they have little or no fallow land to sow for next year’s harvest, and are living on their seed grain. They are, therefore, likely to suffer serious hardship in the winter of 1935-36. They will have no one but themselves to blame. They and all others similarly situated have been warned incessantly that they should, in their own interests, continue their normal agricultural routine until told to stop; but they have given more heed to mischievous propaganda than to the disinterested advice of those who really wish to help them. 120. The new census registration, which was begun in September, caused some little difficulty with the Assyrians. In parts of the Amadiyah, Dohuk and Shaikhan districts, their suspicions were overcome after it had been explained that registration would not prevent them from benefiting from any scheme which might be evolved by the League of Nations for their resettlement outside Iraq. In Mosul town, too, most of the Assyrians completed the necessary forms without demur, but some fifty families refused to do so, and tw T o of the ringleaders of this opposition to the Census Law were sentenced to pay small fines. Reluctance to register was, in the main, due to the propaganda of adherents of the Patriarch, who, following their usual tactics, circulated false rumours regarding the purpose of the census and the consequences of inclusion therein. 121. Mar Shimun himself spent most of the year living with friends in England. In articles in the ecclesiastical press, in a number of pamphlets and in frequent communications to the League of Nations, all of which grossly misrepre sented the facts of the situation of the Assyrians in Iraq, he carried on active propaganda against the Iraqi Government. He thereby violated the condition on which King Faisal had consented, in the summer of 1933, to make him an allowance of £65 per month. Consequently, in May, King Ghazi. at the instance of his Ministers, gave orders that the payment of this allowance should cease. 122. It is feared that the long delay which is occurring in finding a new home for the Assyrians outside Iraq is calculated to affect adversely both the willingness and ability of the Iraqi Government to contribute towards the cost of resettlement. The moral influences which brought them to contrition at the Council table in October 1933 are losing their power, and, when the time comes to claim fulfilment of the promise made by Yasin Pasha at Geneva, the Iraqi Treasury will in all probability insist on setting against any global contribution demanded from Iraq the steadily increasing sum which the Iraqi Government have already, since October 1933, expended on relief work among the Assyrians. 123. The longer the League take to find a new home for the Assyrians the less money there will be forthcoming from Iraq for the operation of resettlement when a suitable territory is ultimately discovered. The Kurds. Barzan. 124. Early in the year the peace of the Barzan area was disturbed by the marauding band of Khalil Khoshawi, a former subordinate leader of Sheikh Ahmad Barzani. As counter-measures, the Government arrested his family, detained in Mosul Mulla Mustafa—Sheikh Ahmad’s brother—and endeavoured to concert plans with the Turkish frontier authorities to prevent Khalil Khoshawi from escaping over the border whenever 'pursued by the Iraqi police. These measures were not effective, and in May Khalil Khoshawi, with a small following, murdered the headmen of three villages who had helped in the opei ations against him. A striking force of 100 police was moved into the area, and Khalil again withdrew across the border into Turkey. Three times in July and twice in September his bands attacked police detachments and caused several casualties, not, however, wdthout themselves losing four or five men. Fresh police dispositions were made, but, although there were several successful engagements[11315] b 12 It*} 23 with Khalil's bands, the marauding raids continued. In November Khalil Khoshawi murdered two more village headmen and, eluding pursuit, again made good his escape to Turkey. At the close of the year he was still at large, and it seems that, without more effective co-operation from the Turkish side, nothing but a chance shot is likely to put a stop to his activities. 125. The house of Sheikh Ahmad Barzani in Mosul was searched by the police in November, and as evidence was found that he was in communication with Khalil Khoshawi, he and five other Barzani detenus were removed to Hillah. Sulaimani. 126. From March to July the security of the Sulaimani liwa was seriously disturbed by the banditry of a certain Saiyid Muhammad Pichkola, an erstwhile lieutenant of the celebrated Sheikh Mahmud. Later in the summer he withdrew to Banah, in Persia, and hopes are entertained that he will stay there. 127. The Iraqi Government were unable this year successfully to negotiate terms with the Persian Government for the migration of the Jaf tribe to their customary summer pastures across the Persian border. The Jaf were, in consequence, obliged to remain with their flocks in the Panjwin area throughout the summer. It is to be feared that the physique, both of their tribe and of their flocks, will suffer from this enforced stay in the malarial plains. The Jews. 128. In the autumn, during the reorganisation of the Ministry of Economics and Communications which followed the appointment of Arshad Beg A1 I mari as Minister, a number of posts occupied by Jews were abolished and their incumbents were not re-employed. 129. Several of these men at once raised an outcry that they had been dismissed because they were Jews, and they succeeded in inspiring in the Jewish press in England a number of articles w T hich accused the Iraqi Government of persecuting the Jewish “minority” in Iraq. A violent anti-Jewish campaign ensued in the Iraqi press, and the Government were obliged to intervene to prevent a dangerous ebullition of popular excitement. Two Iraqi newspapers were suspended and the entry into Iraq of a number of Jewish journals published abroad was temporarily prohibited. The police also took action on several occasions to prevent street demonstrations against Zionism. At the close of the year the excitement had subsided and the situation was again normal. Education. 130. At the special request of the Iraqi Government, Mr. Nowell Smith, formerly headmaster of Sherborne School, visited Iraq during the Easter holidays to advise the Government on the question of establishing a secondary boarding school on English public school lines. In his report he outlined the conditions which he considered necessary for the success of the scheme. No further action has yet been taken by the Iraqi Government, but Mr. Nowell Smith’s report provides a basis on which it may be hoped a beginning will eventually be made. 131. In April, at the invitation of the Iraqi Government, Dr. Hermann Suedhof, Director of Occupational Schools in the State of Prussia, visited Iraq to report on the organisation of technical and occupational schools similar to those existing in Germany and elsewhere in Europe. His report has not been published, but it is understood that he has recommended the opening of technical schools on the German model. 132. Towards the end of the year it seemed likely that the Government were toying with the idea of inviting a German to take up a permanent post in charge of technical education. As such a step would, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, run counter to the spirit of Annexure 3 to the Treaty of 1930, His Majesty’s Ambassador persuaded the Iraqi Government to hold their hand until it was ascertained whether a suitable candidate was available in the United Kingdom.24 133. It would appear that the first approaches in this matter were made by the Ministry of Education without the knowledge or consent of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The Press. 134. A law amending the Press Law of 1933 was passed by Parliament in April and came into force in May. It was intended by this means to strengthen official control over the Arabic press and to make it easier for the Government to suspend or suppress offending publications. The chief feature of the amending law was a provision preventing newspaper editors from holding licences for two papers and prohibiting the editor of a suspended newspaper from acting as the editor of another during the period of suspension. This provision was designed to make it impossible for a suspended publication to reappear immediately under the same direction, with identical format but with a slightly changed name. Another noteworthy feature of the amending law was a clause providing that no newspaper “ self-declared to be the organ of an authorised political party” may be suspended without a court judgment. At present, however, no newspaper published in Iraq actually claims to be the organ of any particular party. 135. On the whole the attitude of the Arabic press towards British policy in Iraq has been restrained. The one serious offender was the A hali. In March His Majesty’s Ambassador had to protest strongly against the publication of articles concerning the appointment of a British vice-consul at Diana and the adminis tration of the Port of Basra, which were couched in abusive terms with pointed references to His Majesty’s Government. As a result t\i&amp; Ahali was suspended for ten days. It reappeared, however, immediately as Saut-al-Ahali, under the same editorship, and continued its policy of scurrilous articles on the work of the British officials in Iraq. In April His Majesty's Ambassador again protested to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and for a while there was an improvement in the tone of this newspaper. The improvement did not, however, continue for long, and on the 23rd May, following further representations, it was suspended for one year. A short while later it was again revived as the Hali and, in September, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires had again to draw the attention of the Iraqi Government to offensive criticism of British policy. The Government, this time, took energetic action and the Hali was suspended for a year. Justice. 136. In November the adviser to the Ministry of Justice informed His Majesty’s Embassy that the Iraqi Government were considering the introduction of a cjiange in the existing judicial organisation of the country by establishing local courts of appeal similar to those which existed under the Ottoman regime. At present therte are courts of first instance at the capital of each of the liwas and all appeals are heard by the court of appeal and cassation at Bagdad. The Iraqi Government desired to set up six provincial courts of appeal, leaving the supreme appellate court at Bagdad to function in civil cases merely as a court of cassation in regard to judgments given in the provincial courts of appeal. 137. Although there is much to be said in favour of this change, the Iraqi Government were advised in December by His Majesty’s Ambassador that it would constitute a modification of the judicial guarantees given by the Iraqi Government at the time of Iraq s admission to the League of Nations. Consequently, it could not be effected without the consent of the Council of the League of Nations. In these circumstances, the Government are unlikely to proceed further with their proposal. 138. Attention was drawn during the year to the inefficiency of the Exe cution Department of the Bagdad civil courts. Some thousands of past judgments had never been executed and conditions in the Department were found to be generally chaotic. With a view to remedy this state of affairs, Mr. Drower persuaded the Ministry of Justice in December to depute Mr. Campbell (one of the British judges employed under the Judicial Agreement of 1931) to make recom mendations for the reorganisation of the Department.25 Penal Code. 139. The amendments to the Penal Code, mentioned in last year’s report, came before Parliament, but had not been passed before the session was prorogued. The War Office and Air Ministry were apprehensive that insufficient protection was afforded, under certain of these amendments, to the British Forces in Iraq, but their suggestions were not regarded favourably by the Ministry of Justice. 140. His Majesty’s Embassy were consulted at every stage in the preparation of a municipal law to embody the accepted principles of international law in regard to the privileges enjoyed by the Diplomatic Body in Iraq. A satisfactory text was found, but the law had not been passed at the end of the year. An addition was also made to the suggested Penal Code amendments providing for the special protection to be afforded to diplomatic representatives in Iraq. 141. A short law amending the Criminal Procedure Regulations was passed in April. The changes thereby introduced were, however, of minor importance, and the objectionable features of the law, outlined in paragraph 147 of last year’s report, remained unaltered. The Census. 142. On the 30th August the Minister of the Interior issued a notification under the Census Law of 1927 ordering a general census of the population of Iraq to be taken beginning from the 15th September. This step was a necessary corollary to the enactment of the National Defence Law. The work of registering the population appears to be progressing smoothly, though how far it has been carried out is not known. Minor difficulties with the Assyrians, which came to notice, are described in the section dealing with these people. Distinguished Visitoi's. 143. The Most Hon. the Marquess of Londonderry, Secretary of State for Air, arrived in Bagdad from Amman in a Victoria aircraft on the 1st January, 1934, and left for India in an aircraft of Imperial Airways on the 4th January. During his stay, Lord Londonderry was the guest of His Majesty’s Ambassador. His programme included an audience with King Ghazi and ex-King Ali and a visit to the Royal Air Force at Hinaidi. 144. In March Lieutenant-General Sir Arthur Wauchope, High Com missioner for Palestine and Transjordan, paid a private visit to His Majesty's Ambassador, and stayed for a week at His Majesty's Embassy. A very full programme included visits to many of the Mesopotamian battlefields, some of the principal modern excavations, and the oil-fields of the Iraq Petroleum Company. General Wauchope met King Ghazi, King Ali, the Prime Minister, members of the Cabinet, and many of the senior British officials. 145. On the 5th April Air Chief Marshal Sir Edward Ellington, Chief of the Air Staff, arrived at Hinaidi with a flight of Royal Air Force aeroplanes. After inspecting units at Hinaidi and visiting the new cantonment at Dhibban, he left again by air for Amman on the 9th April. 146. The Right Rev. the Bishop in Jerusalem flew to Bagdad in a Royal Air Force machine on the 1st May and returned to Palestine on the 12th May. During his stay he held services at Hinaidi, Bagdad and Shaibah, and had opportunities for renewing touch with the civil chaplaincy, over which he exercises supervision. 147. His Excellency the Viceroy of India and Lady Willingdon, travelling to England in Imperial Airways, spent the night of the 15th May in Bagdad as the guests of His Majesty’s Ambassador. On their return journey to India in August they stayed with His Majesty's Charge d’Affaires and met King Ghazi and some of his Ministers at dinner. [11315] B 1326 148. The Right Hon. Sir Philip Sassoon, the Under-Secretary of State for Air, made a short stay in Bagdad from the 30th September to the 2nd October, while on a tour by air to Singapore on official business. On the afternoon of his arrival he was invited by King Ghazi to tea at the new palace, Qasr-al-Zahur. IV.—Internal Affairs (Economic). Budget Estimates for 193U-35. 149. The budget estimates were prepared by Nasrat Beg A1 Farsi, as Minister of Finance, and approved by the Cabinet shortly before it resigned. They were, however, accepted almost in their entirety by the incoming Minister, Naji Pasha A1 Suwaidi, as they adequately reflected the unexceptionable and forthodox principles which the new Government had published as being the foundation of their financial policy. This declaration was expressed in the following simple words :■— “ To finance the State administration from normal receipts, and assign extraordinary receipts to the carrying out of major capital works; to establish a permanent cadre for State officials on sound bases, and to see that no expansion in establishments is carried out except in case of unavoidable necessity; to improve and increase the species of natural products, and exert all possible efforts for finding fresh and suitable markets for the disposal of these products.” 150. The Treasury authorities estimated that the receipts from Customs and Excise would show a further increase, an estimate based on the fact that the revenue from this source during the financial year then coming to a close was well in excess of the estimates and showed a tendency to improve. Revenue from natural produce was estimated to provide the same amount as in the preceding year. Receipts from animal taxation were expected to improve because of the better grazing facilities made available by the welcome heavy rainfall of the winter. No changes in the form or incidence of taxation were provided for. True to the declaration of policy noted above, the Minister refrained from following the tempting precedent set in the two preceding years, in which the dead rent and advance royalty payments due from the British Oil Development Company were absorbed into general revenues, and, instead, hypothecated the amount falling due on the 1st January, 1935, for the capital works programme. 151. 1 he expenditure side of the estimates received some relief by the disappearance of provision for the repayment of the Ottoman Public Debt, the last instalment of which was paid on the 1st March, 1934. Substantial increases were again budgeted for in the expenditure on defence forces and police, which together absorbed 38 per cent, of the total revenues, a percentage which expands annually. The policy of fostering and intensifying educational facilities necessitated a further increase in the amounts allocated for this purpose, the expenditure on which takes up 11 per cent, of the total revenues, and also grows greater yearly. The 5 per cent, cut in official salaries, which was introduced as a crisis measure in 1930, was maintained during the year, althou°’h half of the cut was restored to military and civil pensioners. 152. The debates on the estimates absorbed a good deal of the time of both Houses, and attracted the usual flow of speeches from members with parochial oi personal axes to grind, but attracted little real interest in Parliament or in the press. A few changes of no particular importance were made during the passage of the law through Parliament, and the estimates received full constitutional sanction before the beginning of the financial year to which they related. The figures as finally approved were as follows : Iraqi dinars. Revenue 3,818,807 Expenditure ... ... ... 3,813,197 Surplus 5,61027 153. It was remarked in the last annual report that each successive occupant of the post of Minister of Finance, in all the frequent changes which have occurred, has adhered to a strictly orthodox policy of maintaining equilibrium in the normal budget estimates. The estimates of 1934^35 give a &gt; _ JR: further demonstration of this. Imitative though the Iraqi politician undoubtedly is, he has remained unaffected by the monetary experiments and expedients to which other and wealthier States throughout the world have had recourse. A balanced budget and the segregation for capital purposes of the special oil revenues is still the keystone of Iraqi finance. Supplementary Estimfites for 1934—35. 154. Only one supplementary allocation was authorised before the end of 1934, an additional sum of 17,000 dinars being provided, by means of a special ordinance, for the provision of relief for the Assyrian refugees in Mosul. Actual Receipts and Expenditure for 1933—34. 155. The estimates for the financial year which ended on the 31st March, 1934, as finally approved by the Iraqi Parliament, provided for a total expendi ture of 3,765,000 dinars, the whole of which was to be met from revenue, leaving a small balance on the right side. A variety of causes necessitated the issue of supplementary allotments for unforeseen expenditure, the aftermath of the Assyrian disturbances being a principal factor. In the event, the expenditure estimates were increased by a net amount of 105,540 dinars, which could not be supplied by reappropriation within the estimates themselves, and a deficit of this amount was therefore anticipated. The actual deficit realised was, however, greater than this, as the following final figures show :— Iraqi dinars. Expenditure ... ... ... 3,736,443 Revenue ... ... ... ... 3,608,189 Net deficit ... ... ... 128,254 156. The deficit was brought about by a short fall on anticipated revenue to the extent of 156,811 dinars, and a saving on expenditure of 134,001 dinars. The failure to collect the estimated amount of revenue was due to the non-receipt of the sum of 140,625 dinars, which was payable on the 1st January, 1934, by the British Oil Development Company, as the second instalment of their conces sionary payments. The company took advantage of the period of three months’ grace allowed for the payment, and actually paid a few days overdue, after the end of the financial year. Another, but less important, failure to collect a concessionary payment arose out of the inability of the Latifiyah Estate Company to meet capital and interest payments of approximately 4,450 dinars due from them to the Government. There was a shortage in the collections of revenue from agricultural produce to the extent of 10 per cent, of the estimates, owing to stagnation in the grain markets resultant upon the low prices prevalent abroad. The large available export surplus remained in possession of the growers and without payment of Istihlak taxation. The deficit from land revenue was, however, counterbalanced by a further increase in the excise receipts from tobacco and an important increase in the revenue derived from the excise duty on locally manufactured spirits. Reductions had been made in the rates of i export duty and excise tax, so as to enable the local product to compete on more equal terms with the cheaper smuggled liquor, and this measure proved even more successful than had been hoped. 157. The saving, or, more correctly, the underspending, was spread out over the whole estimates, and was, in fact, greater than the volume of supplementary allotments. The real reason for the apparent deficit of 128,254 dinars on the year was therefore the failure to collect during the year the instalment due from the British Oil Development Company.29 160. The increasing reliance upon the receipts from customs and excise dues is marked, and although the revenue derived from land taxation generally shows signs of reviving, the policy of the Government appears to be opposed to making the land provide as great a share of the governmental income as it was made to do ML in the early years of the Administration. In 1922 the receipts from land taxation, as more or less classified in the first four items of the table, provided 30- / per cent, of the total revenue, whereas customs and excise receipts represented 41 • 5 per cent. only. During 1933-34 the values were 17-9 per cent, and 56-2 per cent, respectively. Land Revenue. 161. No further alteration was effected in the machinery for the collection of taxation upon natural and agricultural produce, which, since the introduction in 1931 of the Istihlak method, has been levied by taxing the produce only when it is marketed or exported. Rental is charged for occupied Government lands and a water rate is levied upon land watered by flow irrigation. The defects of this system are described in paragraphs 172-176 of the report for 1933, and the difficulties and expense attendant thereon did not appreciably diminish during the year. These disadvantages, however, are generally considered to be more than outweighed by the relief afforded to the land owner and cultivator, and, to some extent, to the provincial revenue officials, by the elimination of the complicated system of varied assessments, calculated upon area, tenure and actual crops, which was previously in force. The appreciable drop in Treasury receipts occasioned by the change is not regarded by the Government as a matter calling for remedy. Income Tax. 162. The efforts of the Income Tax Department to tighten up their machinery and widen their net achieved a measure of success, as the receipts during the financial year were substantially greater than those of the preceding years and exceeded the estimates. No alteration was made during the year in the basis of taxation, which is— First £150 of income free of tax. Next £150 of income is taxed at the rate of 6 per cent. Income in excess of £300 is taxed at the rate of 9 per cent. 163. The effects of certain decisions by the income-tax and judicial authorities upon British interests are described in paragraphs 216-218 below. The Income Tax Department is still only feeling its way, and generally conducts its activities with increasing efficiency and forbearance. • Land Settlement. 164. Further satisfactory progress was made during the year towards the goal of a uniform and scientific system of land tenure throughout Iraq, in pursuance of the policy inaugurated during 1932. Four full time British land settlement officers were working in the Bagdad, Kut and Kirkuk Liwas, and the area completely settled up to the 1st October, 1934, covered about 3,500 square miles. The total area ordered to be placed under settlement is approximately 11,500 square miles, of which slightly less than half is unsurveyed desert and uncultivated land. The area over which settlement was proceeding at the end of the year was roughly 2,500 square miles. The work is laborious, but of permanent and'valuable effect. It is appreciated by the populace, and, in fact, great difficulty is being encountered in heading off demands for sporadic settlement all over the country. Another difficulty lies in the insufficiency of competent Iraqi assistant settlement officers, of whom ten are already employed, and the land settlement officers are paying much attention to training suitable Iraqis for the work. Capital Development Policy. 165. A decision was reached during the year upon the method of financing the capital works programme. The Government which came into power in March, profiting by the fact that the timid inclination of their predecessors towards a foreign loan, to be secured on the oil revenues, was strongly and adversely criticised in the Chamber of Deputies and the press, officially declared30 that all works would be financed direct from the Government’s own resources and that there was no intention of having recourse to foreign capital. The discussions wmch had been initiated with Messrs. Barings regarding the conditions under wiiich loan funds could be raised in London were accordingly terminated. The Lroyernment then turned its attention to the overdue revision of the five-year olan which was hastily prepared in 1931 and had been found to be in many wavs impracticable, and which, with only two years to run, had lagged far behind the schedule. Ihe new programme, as finally approved by the Legislature, provided for expenditure from oil revenues of £3,237,000, spread out over a period of five years, to be devoted to the undermentioned objects :— . . Iraqi dinars. I.—Irrigation works ... ... 1,891,500 II-—Building and equipment ... 943,700 III.—Hoads and bridges ... ... 293 800 Advances and grants ... ... 108,000 3,237,000 !66. Considerable hostility was evinced to the proposals of the Government on the grounds that the heavy expenditure proposed on large schemes of agricul tural development, for which the country was not yet ready, would absorb^funds required for more essential and less ambitious schemes. During the passage of the necessary legislation, the Government were forced, in order to placate their of V £7 a 50 nnn n lh l v ? m t J e P ro g ram me proposed expenditure to the extent £7o0,000, the allotment for the Habbaniyah Escape being reduced by £600 000 eliminated 81011 Th° r fT ° f the ‘T pr0p ° Sed Ba g dad Midges befZg enS eliminated.

The following is a statement of the national finances on the 31st March, 1934 :— Iraqi dinars. (а) Deficit on normal estimates up to the 31st March, 1933 310,641 (б) Deficit on normal estimates during 1933-34 ... ... 128,254 (c) Net deficit on the 31st March, 1934 ... ... 438,895 {d) Receipts from capital sources up to the 31st March, 1934 1,934,074 (e) Expenditure on captial works up to the 31st March, 1934 942,685 (/) Surplus on capital account ... ... ... 991,389 (g) Net surplus on both capital and ordinary account ... 552,494 (h) Railway loans to be charged off ... ... ... 343,875 {i) Net surplus on all accounts on the 31st March, 1934 ... 208,619 170. From the above it will be clear that, despite the endeavours of succeeding Iraqi Governments to segregate the revenue derived from oil royalties and dead rent payments for purely capital purposes, they have had to draw on this source of wealth to the extent of nearly half a million dinars in order to finance a series of revenue deficits, and to the extent of 350,000 dinars to write off irrecoverable loans made for essential railway works. Appreciation of the Financial Position of Iraq on December 31, 1934. 171. The figures given above refer to the period which ended on the 31st March, 1934. By the end of the calendar year further improvement had manifested itself. Revenue from agricultural and natural produce has kept pace with the estimates, whilst the receipts from customs and excise are higher than had been anticipated, and the collections from all sources are well in advance of those of the previous years. No unforeseen expenditure of any importance has been necessary. The belated payment from the British Oil Development Company which was responsible for the deficiency of the previous year has been brought to account, and a small windfall of 10,000 dinars has been received as a contribu tion from the profits of the Iraqi Currency Board. The results up to the 31st December warrant the assumption that the current financial year will close with a substantial surplus on both revenue and capital account. 172. An analysis of the accounts discloses that the machinery of Govern ment has ample financial fuel on which to run. The only item of national debt, the residual balance of the Ottoman Public Debt inherited from Turkey at the time of the formation of the State of Iraq, was completely extinguished during the year under review. By retarding the too highly-geared programme of capital development and utilising part of the special oil receipts to cover deficits (which were not the result of injudicious spending, but arose mainly out of the world economic depression), the country has avoided all forms of governmental borrowing, and is able to finance all its operations from its own resources. National capital assets of every kind, which include many valuable items handed over free of charge by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, are possessed without any corresponding capital liability existing. The Iieasuiy has a cash balance of more than £500,000. 173. This position has been built up in the last ten years, during which the country has not only paid its way, but has redeemed its share of the Ottoman Public Debt from its own resources at a cost of £1| million, and has devoted more than that sum on development works of a capital nature. 173. The redemption of the debt and the earlier capital expenditure were bold steps, and had it not been for the influx of wealth originating in the Kirkuk oil-field, the depleted Treasury would have been subjected to severe embarrass ment during the years of economic crisis which followed. To revert to the simile32 earlier utilised, the country runs on oil fuel, and the prosperity of its finances is dependent upon receipts from the Iraq Petroleum Company. Without them the country would now be heavily in debt and social services would be starved. It is to be hoped therefore that the Government will be able to resist the temptation to draw on these revenues for purposes of recurring expenditure to an extent which could not be rectified if and when this source of income is no longer available. There is a marked tendency to increase the expenditure from the 'treasury on social services, such as health and education, and on the armed forces. Other expenditure is certain to grow, whereas the ordinary revenue possesses a lesser degree of elasticity, as may be inferred from the ever-increasing proportion of the revenue derived from customs and excise. In these circumstances, the difficulties of budgeting are not likely to decrease, and the temptation to absorb the special revenues to meet recurring expenditure will grow in proportion. But even after giving this possibility its full weight, the financial position and prospects of Iraq are sound and improving. The innate conservatism of Iraqi statesmen in matters of finance, which seems to be a national characteristic, can, with reasonable safety, be relied upon not to destroy this almost unique example of complete national solvency arising largely from the beneficent operations of international capitalists. National Currency. 174. The nominal value of notes and coins in circulation increased from 2,898,363 dinars on the 1st January, 1934, to 3,429,365 dinars (coins 590,050 dinars and notes 2,839,315 dinars) at the end of November 1934. The increase is substantial, and whilst there is yet insufficient data available to enable its significance as a seasonal factor or otherwise to be accurately gauged, there is little doubt that the purchasing power of the public is increasing. Repatriation of Indian currency continued throughout the year. 175. The Reserve Fund in the hands of the Iraq Currency Board in London, which forms the backing for the currency, was valued at £3,484,843 on the 30th November; the sterling cover therefore represents more than 100 per cent, of the nominal value of the currency in circulation. It is the intention of the board to build up an additional reserve, in excess of 100 per cent, cover, to the extent of 10 per cent, of the value of the currency, in order to provide for possible depreciation in the value of the sterling securities in which the Currency Reserve Fund is invested. A contribution of £10,000 was paid by the board from the investment profits of the fund to the Iraqi Government during 1934, as a forerunner of substantial annual contributions in future. 176. No difficulties whatever were experienced in the supply and use of the currency during the year, and there appears to be general satisfaction with the working of the Currency Board. Port of Basra. 177. The operations of the port of Basra during the financial year which ended on the 31st March, 1934, were again profitable, and, as appears to be inevitable where this department is concerned, showed revenue in excess of, and expenditure less than, the conservatively framed estimates. The number of oil tankers going to and from Abadan, from which the bulk of the “ marine ” dues are received, was larger than had been anticipated. Import tonnage increased owing to the continued importation of pipe-line and other constructional material by the oil companies. General imports increased to a minor degree, but export tonnage was disappointing owing to the poorness of the date crop and the stagnation of grain movements. 178. After paying the eleventh instalment (£36,058) of the capital debt and interest charges due to His Majesty’s Government, and making full provision for depreciation, the revenue surplus derived was £28,509 (as compared with an estimated surplus of £6,700). The port is in a strong position financially, with substantial reserves. Expenditure to the extent of £67,448 was incurred on33 \(c capital works during the year, most of which should prove to be revenue producing or profit making in due course. In addition to handling the affairs of the Fao Bar Dredging Service, the Port Administration controls and finances the Central Power House, which supplies electrical energy to the whole Basra area; the Persian Gulf Lighting and Buoying Service on behalf of the Government of ^ India; and is preparing to assume control of the Basra Water Supply and a large new civil aerodrome. This unification of control is a potent factor in reducing the cost of, and charges for, the services concerned, and brings welcome grist by way of revenue to the mill of the port itself. 179. Eight hundred and eighty-one ships entered the port area during the year 1933-34, of which 707 went to Abadan or Mohammerah and 174 to Basra. This represents an increase of sixty-nine ships over the number which entered the port area during the preceding year. All the additional ships were tankers, the number of ships for Basra remaining stationary. 180. The revenue and expenditure figures for the period the 1st April to the 31st December reveal the same ineradicable tendency to make a surplus, as is commented on above. Further reductions in port dues are in contemplation. 181. No progress was effected during the year in the matter of the formation of the port trust envisaged in the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1930, as in present circumstances the position is quite satisfactory to both Governments. Fao Bar Dredging Service. 182. Dredging operations to maintain the deep water channel known as the Rooka Channel at the least depth of 23 feet continued throughout the year. A change in policy became effective at the end of the financial year 1933-34 by reason of the complete repayment of the original loan taken from the Anglo- Persian Oil Company (Limited), whereby the organisation was entirely relieved from debt. The disappearance of amortisation charges from the operating expenditure of the service enabled the Iraqi Government to order a geneial reduction of 25 per cent, in the scale of dredging dues levied upon ships using the channel, with effect from the 1st April, 1934, involving an approximate total remission of £65,000 during the year. The Government also decided to accept the repeated recommendations of the Port Director that a thud diedgei should be provided in order to relieve the strain on the two existing diedgers (which have worked at great stress ever since the dredging scheme was undertaken), and to allow for emergencies. This involves expenditure of approximately 115,000 diijars, the bulk of which will be met fiom icseive funds available for the purpose. Had it not been for the expenditure on purchasing the third dredger a further substantial reduction in dues would be justified. 183. The Iraqi Government have refused for a number of reasons to ratify the revised dredging agreement which was signed by the Ministry of Finance and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (Limited) in June 1932, and, since fj 161 ! financial obligations to the company have disappeared, are not willing to hind themselves in the manner desired by the company. Ihe latter are anxious to secure at least an authoritative, and quotable, assurance that it is the intention of the Government to restrict the dredging dues to a scale sufficient only to cover the cost of the dredging operations, including the building up of adequate reserves. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company pay in respect of their tanker traffic more than 90 pei ; cent, of the total revenue derived by the Iraqi Government from the dredging due, and, as they provided the money from which the cost of dredging and maintaining the channel (a vital artery for Iraq s seaborne commerce) was met, their representations have received the active support o His Majesty’s Embassy. At least one Iraqi Minister has flirted with the attractive idea of maintaining the scale of dues at rates high enough to make available substantial and easily obtained funds, which could be appropriated for payment to His Majesty’s Government in liquidation of the outstanding capital debt of the Port of Basra. An oral assurance has been obtained to the effect that the Iraqi Government accept the principle of assessing dues at no34 higher rate than is necessary to pay for the maintenance of the service, but the means whereby this assurance can be officially and incontrovertibly recorded was still under consideration at the end of the year. particular interest were introduced into the system or the administration, and no major capital works were undertaken. 185. The volume of traffic during the financial year which ended on the 31st March, 1934, was greater than had been anticipated. The development of third-class passenger traffic, encouraged by extensive reductions in the fares, made further progress, and the revenue from this source showed a substantial increase. Although the movement of grain failed almost completely as a source of freight revenue, for reasons explained elsewhere, the tonnage of imported goods carried was much greater than had been allowed for in the estimates. The Persian transit trade revived temporarily, and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company continued to transfer large quantities of oil from Northern to Southern Persia through Iraq. The consequence was that, as in previous years, the railways have been able to show a handsome surplus arising out of receipts from special traffic of a temporary nature. 186. The following figures show the financial effect of the year’s working :— The figures of expenditure include full provision for depreciation and renewals. 187. Traffic during the remainder of the calendar year continued to be good. Large quantities of grain have been carried for export, date tonnage exceeded that of the previous year, and the movement of oil through Iraq continued. There is every prospect of another large cash surplus being realised at the end of the current financial year. 188. A review of the balance sheet as at the 30th September, 1931, shows that the lailways are in a sound financial position. Although no account is taken of the capital outlay on the system, or of the present value of the assets, the cash position is solvent. I here is a substantial reserve fund available in cash (£72,000), and an adequate amount stands to the credit of the renewals und (£200,000 approximately). Cash balances are ample, and despite the peculiar administrative difficulties under which the Railway Directorate labours m controlling, as a quasi-Iraqi Government Department, a system which is the piopeit) or His Majesty s Government in the United Kingdom, their operations ha\e been attended by a measure of success not entirely expected. They are, however, restricted by the lack of funds from which to finance developments and extensions essential not only to enable the railways to fulfil their functions efficiently but also m the interests of the trade and commerce of Iraq generally, and of the northern' provinces in particular. This consummation awaits agreement regarding the future ownership of the railways, which has for so ong been a mattei for negotiation between the two Governments Iraq Railways. 184.

(a) General. 190. The total value of imports decreased in 1933-34 by 215,000 dinars as compared with 1932-33. The importation of material by the Iraq Petroleum Company, for the purposes of their pipe-lines to the Mediterranean, began in December 1932, and amounted in value during the course of the financial year 1932-33 to 1,114,000 dinars, thus accounting largely for the increase of 1,440,000 dinars in the value of imports in that year as compared with the preceding twelve months. In 1933-34 the imports of the Iraq Petroleum Company fell to 977,000 dinars, a decrease of 137,000 dinars. This largely accounts for the drop of 215,000 dinars in the total value of imports. Never theless the three categories of imports principally affected by the operation of the Iraq Petroleum Company all reveal an appreciable increase, as shown here under, which must be attributed entirely to the growing normal requirements of the country. 1932-33. 1933-34. Iraqi dinars. Iraqi dinars. Metals and ores Machinery Vehicles 837.000 862.000 248.000 315,000 298.000 384,000 1,383,000 1.561,000 Other notable increases are recorded in the imports of tea (by £45,000), instruments (£10,000), and silk and artificial silk piece-goods (£10.000). 191. The value of cotton piece-goods imported fell very considerably by 169,000 dinars, but the decrease is attributable to the lower prices, particularly of Japanese manufactures, prevailing in the market, as is shown by the fact that the yardage of imports increased by 3 million yards. Imports of wollen goods were also lower by 35,000 dinars, and here again the decrease can be ascribed to a fall in prices. Considering the import figures as a whole,- and taking into account the effect of the operations of the concessionary companies on the trade of the country, it would appear that Iraq’s spending power is at present approximately £5 million per annum, with a probability of a steady though slow expansion in the future. (b) Imports from the United Kingdom. 192. The value of imports from the United Kingdom fell from £2,179,000 in 1932-33 to £2,027,000 in 1933-34, a decrease of £152,000. It is estimated that about 50 per cent, of the importations of the concessionary companies are derived from the United Kingdom, and on that basis the smaller requirements of those companies in 1933-34 as compared with 1932-33, would account for 73,000 dinars of the decrease. In the three categories already mentioned as being36 particularly affected by the operation^ cd the Iraq Petroleum Company and other concessionary companies (metals and ores, machinery, and vehicles) the share of the United Kingdom has decreased from 863,000 to 840,000 dinars, a difference of 23,000 dinars, notwithstanding the increase in the total volume of imports. Allowance must be made for considerably higher imports of metals and ores from France (£154,000 as against £250), consisting mainly of material for the pipe line. The policy of the Iraq Petroleum Company is to distribute orders amongst the national interests composing it, and the increased importations from France in 1933-34 represent an adjustment of the position as between France on the one hand and the United Kingdom and the Pnited States of America on the other, in accordance with that policy. It is then apparent that the United Kingdom is maintaining her position in this branch of the import trade. In the cotton piece-goods market the United Kingdom continued to sufter from Japanese competition, and her share of the import trade fell from 417,000 to 301,000 dinars, a decrease of 116,000 dinars in value, or of 6 per cent, of the total value of imports of cotton goods. Increased imports of vehicles from the United Kingdom (121,000 as compared with 56,000 dinars) were recorded. As regards other imports, the position of the United Kingdom was either slightly improved or was well maintained. Transit Trade. 193. The value of imports and exports via Iraq destined for or emanating from neighbouring countries reached 3,008,000 dinars in 1933—34 as compared with 1,934,000 dinars in 1932-33. This is the highest figure reached since 1929-30. The traffic is principally from and to Persia, and consists, in the main,, of imports of petroleum and petroleum products supplied from the South Persian oil-fields to Tabriz and North Persia in general, and of carpets, hides and skins and intestines exported from Persia to the United States and to European countries. This transit trade is of course a valuable asset to Iraq, not only for the revenue derived from the transit dues of 1 per 1,000, but also for the employ ment it provides for transporters by road and for the railways. It is possible that some shrinkage of the volume of petroleum products at present sent from South Persia to North Persia via Iraq may be brought about in course of time as a result of the completion of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company refinery now in process of erection at Kermanshah, but present indications are that several years must elapse before road conditions between Kermanshah and Tabriz are such as to make the supply of North Persia from that source an economic possibility. 194. There was in fact an actual shrinkage noticeable at the end of the year in the direct transit trade with Persia accompanied by an increase in smuggling in both directions. It is well known that large quantities of tea and sugar found their way clandestinely from Iraq to Persia, where the existence of a high tariff enables attractive profits to be made by those so engaged. These profits are enhanced on the return journey, when Persian coins are melted down and the precious metal content is sold at high ruling prices. 195. In some quarters it is believed that this shrinkage in the direct transit trade, in which much Iraqi capital is employed, accounts for the gradual flow of such capital to Palestine, where there are better opportunities of quick profit making (see paragraph 199 below). Exports. (a) General. 196. Exports from Iraq in 1933-34 reached a total value of 2,874,000 dinars, an increase of 310,000 dinars over the preceding year, despite a fall of 44.000 dinars in the value of the exports of the principal Iraqi commodity, dates (835,000 as compared with 879,000 dinars). Exports of grain increased by 41.000 tons and by 22,000 dinars in value. Exports of barley were higher by 20.000 tons, though the aggregate value showed a decrease of 6,000 dinars. Wheat exports were higher by 2,000 tons and by 9,000 dinars in value. Wool exports exceeded those of 1932-33 by 564 tons and by 41,000 dinars. Hides and skins registered a notable advance of 62,000 dinars, and intestines exported were valued at £5,000 more than in the previous twelve months. Exports of cotton,37 though nearly three times as large as those for 1932-33, were still almost negligible at 188 tons, valued at 7,483 dinars. Taking into consideration the depressed world conditions, in the matter of agricultural prices during the period to which these statistics relate, Iraq may fairly be said to have held her own with dft notable success. 197. Exports of gold fell to 426,000 dinars as against 513,000 in 1932-33 and 701,000 in 1931-32. (b) Exports to the United Kingdom. 198. The value of exports to the United Kingdom fell from 958,000 dinars in 1932-33 (37-36 per cent, of the total export trade) to 901,000 dinars in 1933-34 (31-35 per cent.). Excluding exports of gold, the figures are : 1932-33, 445.000 dinars (17-5 per cent.); 1933-34, 475,000 dinars (19-4 per cent.). Exports of dates to the United Kingdom were lower by 36,000 dinars, but, on the other hand, exports of grain of all kinds and of hides and skins showed increases of 30,000 and 25,000 dinars respectively. In other respects the position of the United Kingdom was unchanged. The United States remain, after the United Kingdom, the principal consumer of Iraqi produce, to the value of 361,000 dinars (12-56 per cent, of the total export trade), of which dates account for 229.000 dinars. General Resume. 199 The apparent adverse balance of trade, which in 1932-33 stood at 3,676,000 dinars, fell in 1933-34 to 3,151,000 dinars. Allowance being made for importations by the oil concessionary companies, which cannot be reckoned as part of the country’s normal requirements, the corrected figures are : Iraqi dinars. 1932- 33 ... ... •• ••• 2,513,000 1933- 34 ... ... ... ••• 2,134,000 This decrease in the apparent adverse balance during a period of exceptional difficulty in the case of a purely agricultural country, as yet imperfectly equipped, is a matter for congratulation; less satisfactory is the steadily increasing dram of capital from Iraq to Palestine, which partly results from the Jewish emigration which has taken place in the last six months. It is estimated that about £500,000 has left the country in this way m the past year Most of the emigrants possessing capital have been of the “ sarraf (unofficial banker) class, who have no doubt been attracted by glowing tales of the openings for profitable investment in Palestine, and it is not impossible that much of the capital so exported may be repatriated in course of time, especially if there is a ievi\al m the Persian 'transit trade (see paragraphs 194 and 19o above). 200 There seems little reason to doubt that Iraq s prosperity is bound up with her development as an agricultural country. Her inhabitants have no tradition of industrial occupation and little aptitude therefor, while they have been moderately successful tillers of the soil, with no assistance other than that of nature for generations. Irrigation works, actual and in prospect, must in the course of’ a few years vastly increase the productivity of Iraq, and improved communications, rational grading of produce, and safe and rapid means of transport will enable her to market her products with progressive success. Irregular grading, with an unfortunate tendency to adulterate produce, has indeed proved the chief obstacle in the past to the expansion of Iraq s export trade It is true that the Hate Advisory Board set up by the Iraqi Government has not proved to be a very useful body, but the bulk of the date-packing business is in theffiands of British and American firms, who are fully alive to the necessity of providing an article of recognised standard The Iraqi Government are considering the introduction of regulations providing for the proper grading of cotton for export and they are also contemplating the establishment of a tobacco monopoly with a view to the improvement of locally grown tobacco, while their interest in irrigation schemes shows no sign of slackening.38 Japanese Competition. 201. Japanese manufacturers continued to make severe inroads in the Iraqi market. Imports of Japanese products increased from 210,000 dinars in 1931-32 and 425,000 dinars in 1932-33 to 706,000 dinars in 1933-34. The force of Japanese competition was felt by all importing countries, but principally by the United Kingdom and by Italy, as is shown by the following statistics of imports of cotton piece-goods, the article principally affected :— From. Value. (Thousands of dinars.) Percentage of total imports. 1931-32. 1932-33. 1933-34. 1931-32. 1932-33. 1933-34. United Kingdom .. 494 417 301 42 37 32 India 451 366 179 38 33 19 Japan G6 179 384 5 16 41 202. These figures do not, however, present, as regards India and Japan, an entirely true picture, since many imports, originating in Japan, but reaching Iraq from India, whither they had been exported from Japan in the first instance, are classed as Indian imports. True percentages of Indian and Japanese imports are probably as follows :— 1932-33. 1933-34. India ... ... ... ... 25 15 Japan ... ... ... ... 24 45 203. Japan now occupies the second place, after the United Kingdom, in the import trade of Iraq, a position hitherto held by India. The respective percentages of the trade held by these three countries in recent years are as follows :— United Kingdom India Japan 1931-32. 1932-33. 1933-34. 27-2 34-92 33-64 19-52 12-37 8-90 4-37 6-81 11-72 204. The fact that there is at present no set-off, in the shape of exports of Iraqi produce to Japan, to the steadily increasing volume of Japanese imports has not escaped the notice of the Iraqi Government. There have been negotiations during the year between the Japanese Ambassador and the Iraqi Minister in London with a view to the conclusion of an agreement providing some remedy for this state of affairs. Other considerations apart, the Iraqi authorities are concerned at the encouragement to overtrade and the dislocation of the market arising from the constant cutting of prices by the Japanese. The withdrawal of Japan from the League of Nations, which becomes effective in March 1935, will release Iraq from the obligation to extend most-favoured-nation treatment to Japanese imports, and this fact should prove a valuable argument in the negotiations now proceeding. On the other hand, it will be no simple matter to find Iraqi produce suitable for export to Japan. Salt has been mentioned, of which some £10,000 worth could be made available for export annually, but it is clear that some additional export is needed if the trade balance is to be rectified in any real sense. Unfortunately, Iraq’s principal exportable commodity (dates) is an article of luxury for which the demand in a country with so low a general standard of living as Japan is likely to be severely restricted. Other Foreign Competition. 205. Soviet competition in the Iraqi market has now practically ceased to exist. A Soviet trade agent has been in the country for the past six months or so, and appears to have been principally occupied in trying to dispose of the accumulation of Soviet piece-goods for which no market can be found in competition with Japanese products. Towards the end of the year, however, he purchased some £17,000 worth of unwashed Iraqi wool. Soviet trade has suffered, further, a serious set-back in respect of the supply of boxes for date-packing, allof which were of late years supplied by the U.S.S.R. During the last date-export season, these were found to be much below standard, and date packers are now seeking other sources of supply. A trial consignment has recently arrived from Japan and is reported to be fairly satisfactory. But the probability is that Sweden will now recapture the trade which she formerly held. Foreign competition from other sources does not call for remark. Shipping. 206. In the course of the year there was an increase of foreign competition in the trade with Basra, hitherto confined to the German Hansa Line and to occasional tramp steamers under the Soviet flag or chartered by the Soviet Government from Greek owners. Early in 1934 the Italian Lloyd Triestino j Company initiated a two-monthly service of cargo steamers to Persian Gulf ports I and Basra from Adriatic ports, calling on the return journey at Haifa, Jaffa I and Beirut, as cargo offered, but did not indulge in rate-cutting. Occasional Swedish steamers also put in at Basra, after unloading the bulk of their cargo, generally of railway material, at the new Persian port of Bandar-shahpur. Several vessels of the Japanese Yamashita Shipping Company, carrying a variety j of Japanese manufactures, such as cotton textiles and cement, called at the Persian Gulf ports and at Basra, and the intention of the company is said to be j to make of this a regular service, although the problem of return cargoes from Iraq is likely to prove difficult of solution. 207. Towards the end of the year it was reported that the Nippon Yusen Kaisha and Osaka Shoshen Kaisha companies were contemplating the establish ment of a service in competition with the Yamashita Company. 208. It is estimated that British shipping handles at least 75 per cent, of all sea-borne traffic to and from Iraq, the share of foreign shipping amounting to about 20 per cent, for the Hansa and Lloyd Triestino lines, and 5 per cent, for the now infrequent Greek and other vessels. 209. At the beginning of the date season a great outcry was raised in the vernacular press concerning the alleged excessive freights charged by the regular foreign steamship companies on Iraqi produce, and a number of Iraqi merchants entered into a compact, at the instigation of one Abdul Jabbar Khederi, owner of several river steamers, to ship their produce to India by vessels of the Eastern Steam Navigation Company, of Bombay, at rates cut appreciably below those quoted by the British India Steam Navigation Company. That company, m turn, promptly undercut its competitor and subsequently accepted produce for carriage to India without prepayment of fixed freight in an endeavour to break the opposition. The results of this action by the British company are not likely to become apparent until next season. River Traffic. 210. A considerable portion of the goods discharged from ocean steamers at Basra reaches Bagdad in river steamboats plying on the Tigris, those principally interested in the traffic being the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company a British firm long etsablishel in the trade, and Abdul Jabbar Khederi, already ‘mentioned. Hitherto, the British firm has enjoyed a considerable advantage over competitors in that shippers in the United Kingdom and elsewheie would consent to issue through bills of lading for ocean and river transport to Bagdad only by the British vessels plying between Basra and Bagdad. 1 his tact was naturally unpalatable to Abdul Jabbar Khederi, and there is little doubt that it was at his instigation that the Iraqi Government requested the British fii m to supply a copy of the concession granting them the right to navigate the 1 igns. In reality no concession is or has ever been held or claimed by the company, and their right to navigate the Tigris, which is common to all British-owned ciait, rests upon usage and upon the terms of certain Vizinal letters emanating fiom the Sublime Porte, as the company in due course informed the Iraqi Government. 211. Thereafter, the Iraqi Government applied officially to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom for copies of the relevant ^ izirial letters and these were supplied to them. The motive underlying these enquiries was most probably a desire to challenge the right of British vessels to navigate the Tigns40 at all, inspired no doubt by Abdul Jabbar Khederi. On the other hand, one of this individual’s grievances has been removed, following the consent of shippers to issue through bills of lading to Bagdad by his vessels on the same terms as by the steamers of the British company, and with the recent change of Government it is permissible to hope that no more will be heard of the matter. ^ Tariff Negotiations. 212. Iraq is bound, in tariff matters, for a space of ten years from October 1932, vis-a-vis States members of the League of Nations, by the terms of her declaration to the League, by which she guaranteed most-favoured-nation treatment to those States. Reference has already been made to the fact that she recovers her freedom of action towards Japan, in March 1935, on that country’s ceasing to be a member of the League. 213. In the case of India, the Iraq Government addressed a request in July, through His Majesty’s Embassy, to the Government of India, that Indian customs dues on commodities of particular interest to Iraq, such as dates and grain, should be reduced, arguing that those duties have of late been considerably increased, with the result that Iraqi export trade has been adversely affected and the balance of trade is overwhelmingly in favour of India. The Iraqi Government hinted at measures of retaliation should their request not receive favourable consideration, and in doing so rely presumably on the reservation in Iraq’s declaration to the League of Nations providing that she should be freed from the most-favoured nation obligation vis-a-vis any member of the League which should take measures of a nature to disturb the balance of trade to the detriment of Iraq, and should not, on being requested to do so, remove or modify such measures within three months of being requested to do so. The request of the Iraqi Government is still under consideration by the Government of India. 214. The suggestion, put forward by the Iraqi Government at the time of the World Economic Conference in 1933, that United Kingdom duties on dates and other produce of interest to Iraq should be abolished or reduced, was still under consideration at the end of the year. 215. No progress was made towards the opening of negotiations for the conclusion of an economic agreement between Syria and Iraq. Taxation. 216. British banks, shipping companies and commercial firms holding the agency in Iraq of manufacturers and others established in the United Kingdom experienced certain difficulties during the year in connexion with claims for payment of income tax under the provisions of the Iraqi Income Tax Law. In the case of the banks, it was proposed to assess them for taxation on interest paid by them on balances due to their correspondents abroad, the argument being that such interest was, in the words of the law, “ earned, accrued in or derived from Iraq.” Particulars of interest payments of this nature were duly supplied by the banks under protest to the finance authorities, but no assessment has yet been made. The amount involved is small. 217. The earnings of shipping companies in Iraq are, by the terms of the Iraq Income Tax Law, held to amount to 5 per cent, of their gross receipts in Iraq, on which tax is leviable at the rate of 9 per cent. These gross receipts include the charges for freight received in Iraq, but actually payable to other companies for oncarrying after transhipment at other ports. The shipping companies contended that deduction of such charges should be allowed in the assessments to Iraqi income tax, and after some delay a satisfactory settlement on this basis was achieved. 218. The position in regard to taxation of firms representing in Iraq firms established abroad was rather more serious. The contention of the Iraqi finance authorities was that, by the terms of the Income Tax Law, the agents in Iraq were responsible for payment on behalf of their principals of income tax on profits accruing to those principals by reason of their trading “ in or with Iraq.” In December 1933 a test case was heard by the Court of Cassation, which held that the view of the finance authorities was valid according to the letter of the41 K&gt; law. Representations were made to the Iraqi Government by His Majesty’s Embassy on the ground that the intention of the Legislature could not have been to render liable to internal taxation foreign manufacturers exporting their products to Iraq, but merely to tax the profits of those actively engaged in trade within that country. The Iraqi Government were unable either to ignore the judgment of the court of cassation or to render it inoperative by administrative action. They admitted, however, that the wording of the law was unsatisfactory, and suggested that amending legislation might be introduced. This amending legislation is at present under consideration, and it is hoped that it will be passed during the coming parliamentary session. Khanaqin Oil Company and Rafidain Oil Company. 219. Throughout 1934 the Khanaqin Oil Company continued to produce from their Naft Khaneh field. Two wells were opened to production at varying periods. 220. Iraq’s requirements of oil products were supplied during 1934 by the Rafidain Oil Company. Their supplies were procured from the Khanaqin Oil Company’s refinery at Alwand. To meet the full demands for Iraq supple mentary supplies were obtained from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s refinery at Abadan. No changes in oil prices were made during the year. 221. The Weights and Measures Law has still not been brought into force by the Iraq Government, and oils are still sold by gallons, but lubricating oils, grease and insecticides are imported and sold in litres. 222. The status of the Rafidain Oil Company was officially recognised by Government during the year, but certain privileges claimed by the company under the revised convention with the Iraq Petroleum Company had not been conceded at the end of the year. Iraq Petroleum Company. 223. The first oil from the Iraq Petroleum Company’s field at Kirkuk reached Tripoli in July and Haifa a few weeks later. The ceremonial inaugura tion of the pipe-line is to take place early in the new year. The capacity of the pipe-line is 4 million tons annually. During the year the company continued to drill at other points within the area of their concession, but no new wells were brought into production. British Oil Development Company. 224. The payment of £125,000 gold due to the Iraqi Government on the 1st January, 1934, on account of dead rent was not forthcoming on that date, and was still outstanding on the 31st March, 1934, when the period of three months’ grace, provided by the concession, lapsed. The Iraqi Government showed no disposition to accept the company’s offer of £100,000 in cash, with the balance in debentures carrying 6 per cent, interest, and seriously considered closing down their operations. Eventually, however, payment of the full amount due, which, with interest at 5 per cent., amounted to £190,518, was made on the 4th April. This satisfactory settlement at once silenced the criticism which was rife in local circles. The additional capital necessary to effect the payment was provided by the British and Italian groups, the French interests professing 11 themselves to be unable to contribute, and internal conditions precluding any export of additional capital from Germany. As a result, the distribution of the shares appeared to be as follows :— Late in the year the company increased their nominal capital by some £500,000. Oil Companies. Oil Concessionary Companies. Per cent. British group Italian group German group 42 46 1242 225. During the year considerable quantities of heavy oil were exti acted by the company both for their own use and for that of the Iraqi Go\ernment, mainly from an old well originally sunk by the Iraq Petroleum Company in 1928. I his oil is understood to be unsuitable for export, owing to its excessive tai content, and is used by the company for boiler fuel, and by the Iraqi Government for the 0^ extraction of bitumen for road-making. A small refinery is in process of election by the Government in the vicinity of the fields in this connexion. I he position at the various wells is as follows :— Qaiyarah No. 1 (drilled by the Iraq Petroleum Company in 1928) is producing heavy oil. Qaiyarah No. 2 (drilled by the Iraq Petroleum Company in 1928) is filled in. Qaiyarah No. 3 (drilled by the British Oil Development Company) is ready for production, but is usually shut off, being used only occasionally to supplement the supply of heavy oil. Its capacity is placed at 3,000 barrels a day. Najmah No. 1 (drilled by the British Oil Development Company) is complete and mudded down. Its exact capacity is unknown, but is said to exceed 3.000 barrels a day. Najmah No. 2 is approaching completion, being drilled to a depth of 1.000 feet. Najmah No. 3 is drilled to a depth of 1,100 feet, and is stated to be purely experimental. Jawan No. 1 is drilled to 900 feet, and is held to be very promising. Jawan No. 2 has reached a depth of 200 feet. Jawan No. 3 is projected only. Mishraq. There is some uncertainty about this well, which is stated to be 1,550 feet in depth. There has been no production from it as yet, and information from one source is to the effect that no oil is present. This does not, however, tally with the company’s views. Habbarah and Sadid are being prepared for drilling by German rotary drill. 226. Most of the machinery imported by the company in 1934 came from Germany, whence it was supplied in lieu of the cash contribution to the dead rent payment which the German interests were unable to make early in the year. Other Concessions. 227. The scheme for a cement factory envisaged by Yasin Pasha A1 Hashimi made little progress during the year. Samples of raw material submitted by him were tested by Messrs. Vickers Armstrong (Limited), through the intermediary of the Department of Overseas Trade, but his proposals showed no sign of taking concrete form. 228. M. Rotival’s project for a new Bagdad remained in abeyance and may now be considered dead. 229. No progress was made with the proposal to grant a concession for a bus and taxi service in Bagdad. The draft law prepared for submission to Parliament did not reach that body, but it is expected that it will be introduced in the coming session. Bagdad Electric Light and Power Company. 230. The boycott of the company collapsed entirely early in the year, although the local press continued for some time r,hereafter to inveigh against the alleged excessive charges for current. It is satisfactory to record that the Iraqi courts have recently recognised the legal right of the company to charge a reconnexion fee to subscribers who had asked to be disconnected during the boycott. Latifiyah Estates {Limited). 231. This British company was formed in 1928 with a capital of £400,000 (of which only half has been paid up) to develop an area of agricultural land near Bagdad, about 60,000 acres in extent, acquired by them from the Iraqi Government. By the teians of their agreement the Government were to constructat their expense an irrigation canal, the cost of which was to be repaid by the company in twelve half-yearly instalments, beginning on the 31st March, 1932. From the date of completion of the canal the company were to pay also interest at 6 per cent, per annum on the amount due from them and still outstanding. The cost of the canal amounted to £55,000. 232. Owing to the general fall in agricultural prices, and to heavy and unavoidable expenditure on first establishment charges, the company have found themselves unable to make any capital repayment in accordance with the terms of their agreement, and have made no payment on account of interest since the 30th September, 1933, when their aggregate disbursement under this head totalled £8,392. Negotiations have been proceeding for some time between the company and the Iraqi Government with a view to arriving at some equitable and workable arrangement. The company are anxious to secure a reduction of the capital charge, together with an extension of the time for repayment, and to effect an exchange of part of their land, which has not proved to be cultivable, for an adjacent area. The Iraqi Government have shown themselves to be well disposed to the company, whose efforts to improve agricultural methods by precept and example they appear to value, and there are fair prospects that agreement will shortly be reached. Government Works. 233. The steel road bridge over the Tigris at Mosul was completed in May 1934, and was opened by His Majesty King Ghazi on the 10th June, 1934. 234. The Royal residence at Harthiyah, designed as a guest house, was also completed, and His Majesty is temporarily in occupation. The proposal to build a new palace is in abeyance. Habbaniyah Escape Scheme. 235. The indecision and procrastination in regard to this project in 1933 continued throughout the following year. 236. In January it appeared as if the Iraqi Government had at last virtually committed themselves to awarding the contract to Sir Lindsay Parkinson and Co., who, for their part, had agreed to reduce their estimated time for the contract to forty-two months without increase of cost, and to keep their offer open while parliamentary sanction was being obtained for the financial arrangements. Even so, the affair continued to hang fire, certain critics suggesting that the scheme should be carried out departmentally, while others maintained that it should be dropped altogether. When the Iraqi Government brought forward in April a new draft Capital Works Law, embodying provision for the Habbaniyah scheme at an estimated cost of 1,100,000 dinars, this body of unfavourable opinion crystallised into a violent press and parliamentary opposition to the project. The cost of over £1 million was alleged to be more than Iraq could afford to pay for a work the prospective benefits of which were represented as problematical, or at least likely to be long deferred. Its detractors even went to the length of describing it as a strategical measure designed to provide a base for British seaplanes in close proximity to the new Royal Air Force cantonment, and not a work of public utility at all. To silence the clamour of criticism among their own supporters the Cabinet weakly consented to delete from the original scheme the proposed channel from the Habbaniyah Lake alongside the north-western boundary of the Royal Air Force cantonment to the Euphrates, by which water was to have been brought back to the river for irrigation purposes at convenient seasons. The project thus amended ceased to be an irrigation scheme at all, and became a means of flood control, but the reduction of 600,000 dinars in the estimated cost was the factor that made it acceptable to the Chamber; and the Capital Works Law finally passed in May provided only for this restricted scheme at an estimated cost of 500,000 dinars. 237. Further delays were inevitable after this. The Irrigation Depart ment was obliged to scrap much preliminary work already done on the purely irrigational sections of the project, which now required modification to suitthe altered conditions. It was still quite uncertain whether the Iraqi Government would issue a fresh call for tenders or would attempt to carry out the restricted scheme departmentally. At the end of 1934 the matter was still in abeyance, and no visible progress had been made. Kut Barrage. 238. Issue of the invitation to tender for the Kut Barrage and subsidiary works was authorised by the Iraqi Cabinet in January 1934, and the announce ment actually appeared in the Arabic Gazette of the 25th January. The latest date for submission of tenders was the 5th May. 239. The new draft Capital Works Law brought forward by the Govern ment in April included provision for an expenditure of 1,200,000 dinars on this barrage and subsidiary works. The measure was approved in May without modification of this item. 240. On the 5th May the tenders received were duly opened and the following results were disclosed :— Tenderer. Nationality. Contract Time. Contract Price. 1. Societe anonyme Hersent .. French .. 46 months .. Dinars. 1,120,376/949 2. Balfour, Beatty and Co. British .. 3 working seasons .. 1,152,380/209 3. Sir Lindsay Parkinson, Ltd. 46 months.. 1,195,852,601 4. Nuttall, Mowlem, Brand and Abboud (Near East), Ltd. Anglo-Egyptian .. 36 1,213,530/009 5. Pauling and Co., Ltd. British .. 48 „ .. 1,225,520/990 6. Holzman and Berger German .. 43 „ .. 1,499,748/075 7. Holzman and Berger (alternative tender) 40 „ .. 1,456,921/310 241. The lowness of the tender of the Societe anonyme Hersent surprised both the Iraqi departments concerned and competing British firms, who had been confident of their ability to underquote their rivals. 242. For political reasons connected with the position of France as mandatory in Syria there was a strong feeling in Iraqi Government circles that the contract should not be awarded to a French firm. This could, however, not be publicly adduced as a reason for rejecting the tender of the Societ^ anonyme Hersent, whose price was £30,000 less than the lowest British tender, and whose reputation for successful execution of similar undertakings in North Africa was unexceptionable. It was therefore suggested to Messrs. Balfour, Beatty and Co. that they should spontaneously ofier to reduce their contract price by £32,900 in order to bring it below the French figure and give the Tenders Board an excuse for rejecting the latter. Messrs. ^Balfour, Beatty and Co. did so, but the Societe anonyme Hersent countered by offering to reduce its price by £40,000, to present £70,000 worth of plant to the Iraqi Government on completion of the work, and to accept Treasury bonds at United Kingdom Government rates in lieu of cash in case of any stoppage of payments owing to force majeure. This offer was so attractive that the Tenders Board were again hard put to it to find a reasonable excuse for rejecting it. Their prolonged hesitation prompted the French Charge d’Affaires to intervene in the matter, but an unfortunate suggestion made by him to the effect that Iraq, in delaying the awaid, was not acting as an independent Power definitely turned the scale against the French firm. 243. All tenderers except JVIessrs. Balfour, Beatty and Co. bavin 0, now been eliminated, it was felt that His M^ajesty s Embassy might properly use then good offices to secuie the award of the contract to the British firm whose representative was accordingly afforded facilities for an audience with the King and members of the Government. Thanks to this assistance, certain difficulties regarding the financial arrangements to be adapted in case of a stoppage of payments owing to force majeure were successfully surmounted, Messrs. Balfour, Beatty and Co. agreeing to accept Treasury bonds if the circumstances arose, and the contract was finally signed on the 6th September.45 An inaugural ceremony was planned to take place at Kut in the presence of His Majesty King Ghazi on the 10th December, but heavy rains made the road impracticable, and His Majesty was unable to proceed. The ceremony was therefore performed by the Acting Mutessarif of Kut, in the presence of e Mr. G. Balfour, M.P., chairman of Messrs. Balfour, Beatty and Co., and senior 9 officials of the Irrigation Department; and, on the 11th December, King Ghazi held a reception at the palace in celebration of the event, at which he expressed his belief that the work would be completed to the mutual satisfaction of the Government and the contractors, and to the great benefit of Iraq. Tigris Bridges. 244. The revised Capital Works Law passed in the course of the parlia mentary session of 1934 provides for the construction of one steel road bridge instead of the two originally proposed. Towards the end of the year, however, a member of the British firm of consulting engineers employed by the Iraqi Govern ment arrived in Bagdad at the invitation of the Government to advise on bridge construction and on other matters, and is understood to be in favour of the construction of at least one additional bridge. VI. —Communications. Roads. 245. No new main roads were constructed during 1934, but the work of metalling and reconditioning existing roads in the north continued steadily. 246. Several bridges were erected on the Kirkuk-Mosul route, notably at Altun Kupri, and it is proposed to bridge the Great Zab at Eski Kelek, thus | providing more direct communication between Mosul and Erbil, the point of j departure of the Rowanduz road. Rowanduz Road. 247. The surface of the Rowanduz road was well maintained, and traffic thereon continued to increase, although no greater activity than hitherto was shown by the Persian authorities in the matter of metalling the surface on their side of the frontier. There were one or two minor incidents at the respective frontier posts, but nothing occurred during the year to interfere seriously with the normal passage of goods between Persia and Iraq, apart from occasional interruptions due to stress of weather. Trans-Desert Routes. (a) To Syria and Palestine. 248. The negotiations between the Palestine and Iraqi Governments having for their object the encouragement of the direct Bagdad-Haifa route, are described in an earlier section of this report. 249. On the Bagdad-Damascus route some work was carried out in Syrian territory, and the bulk of the trans-desert traffic continues to use this itinerary, particularly in the case of passenger transport. (b) To Saudi Arabia. 250. A survey of the proposed trans-desert route from Najaf to Medina was carried out late iii the year by a commission representing the Iraqi and Saudi Arabian Governments. The members of the commission completed their task towards the end of December and reported that a route, which would require very little work to make it practicable, had been selected, and expressed the hope that it would be open for pilgrimage traffic in time for the “ Haj ” of 1935. This can be little more than a pious aspiration, since the “ Haj ” opens about the 14th March, and much work, in the most favourable circumstances, must remain to be done in the matter of reconditioning of long-neglected wells and providing petrol dumps. It is understood that the proposal is that pilgrims shall be carried from Najaf to Medina and vice versa in cars and lorries belonging to Iraqi companies, and between Medina and Mecca by transport controlled by the Saudi Arabian Government.46 Telegraphs and Telephones. 251. By the end of the year the telephone and telegraph circuit to connect Bagdad with Transjordan and Palestine had been extended to the frontier beyond Rutbah, and can be brought into use for international traffic as soon as the projected work, for which a financial grant has already been made, has been carried out by the Transjordanian Government. 252. Wireless communications with the Saudi Arabia station at Riyadh and with Beirut were inaugurated during the year. A irports. 253. The Bagdad civil airport functioned satisfactorily throughout the year. 254. The Ministry of Finance approved, early in 1934, estimates submitted by the Port Directorate at Basra for the construction of a civil air port, on port land at Margil, near Basra. Hitherto civil aircraft has made use of the Royal Air Force ground at Shaiba, which is difficult of access. The estimates, which provided for the expenditure of £50,000, available from surplus funds of the port, in the course of two years, have not yet been submitted to Parliament, but work on the scheme has been in progress for some time. London-Melbourne Centenary Air Race. 255. On the occasion of the MacRobertson international air race, complete and very satisfactory arrangements were made for the competitors by the Iraqi Department of Civil Aviation. All passport and customs regulations were waived for entrants, and no hitch of any kind occurred, while the authorities went out of their way to ensure the comfort of pilots and passengers during their short stay on Iraqi soil. The race aroused much interest locally, and a crowd of several thousand people gathered at the air port on the night of the 20th-21st October, when the first competitors in the race reached Bagdad. Regular Air Services. 256. The air services of the Imperial Airways, Air France and the Royal Dutch Air Line were operated normally during the year, but disaster overtook a Douglas machine of the last-named company in the course of its Christmas flight to Batavia, tne aircraft crashing some miles south of Rutbah, all passengers and crew, seven in number, being killed. The causes of the crash are as yet unascertained. 257. Air mail charges were unchanged. VII.— -Am and Military Matters. The Royal Air Force. Strength. j distribution of the Royal Air Force garrison in Iraq remained unchanged, with the exception that one section of armoured cars was transferred from Basra to Shaibah. I he distribution of the fighting units at their permanent stations was as follows :— Hinaidi— 1 bomber squadron. 1 bomber-transport squadron. 2 sections, armoured cars. Mosul— 1 bomber squadron. 1 section, armoured cars. Shaibah— 1 bomber squadron. 1 section, armoured cars. Basra— 1 flying-boat squadron. Hinaidi also contained Air Headquarters, the Aircraft Depot, Royal Air Force Genei al Hospital, and the usual maintenance and ancillary units.47 Command. 259. During 1934 Air Vice-Marshal C. S. Burnett, C.B., C.B.E., D.S.O., was the Air Officer Commanding the British Forces in Iraq. Summer Training Camy. 260. The annual summer training camp at Ser Amadia was reopened without difficulty in June. Owing to the fact that parties stayed for two weeks instead of three as in previous years, more personnel were enabled to visit the camp, which was closed in September. Royal A ir Force in the Persian Gulf. 261. Steady development of air activities along the Arabian coast took place throughout the year. Numerous flights by aircraft of Nos. 70, 84 and 203 Squadrons were carried out. Unfortunately, on three occasions aircraft were forced to land on the Hasa coast owing to engine failure and bad weather. Reports were made to the Saudian Government at Riyadh through His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda. Towards the end of the year, there were indications that the Saudi Government were preparing to make difficulties over these forced landings. 262. During May an air reconnaissance of the Qatar Peninsula was carried out with the object of locating landing grounds and alighting areas. Possible landing grounds and alighting area sites were located. 263. Owing to internal disturbances at Dibai, during October, three Wapitis conveyed the Political Agent, Bahrein, from Bahrein to Sharjah, and also carried out demonstration flights over Dibai. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf subsequently reported that these demonstration flights had a tranquillising effect. 264. In connexion with the development of the Basra-Aden air route, it was essential to establish a landing ground between Masirah Island and Murbat. This work was carried out during November in co-operation with the political and naval authorities in the Persian Gulf, and a landing ground was selected and marked out at Khor Gharum in Sukra Bay. 265. During the latter part of the year negotiations have been proceeding with the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi for an agreement for air facilities at Abu Dhabi and Yas Island. The result of these negotiations is not at present known. 266. Proposals were submitted to the Air Ministry for the development of the Bagdad-Karachi and Cairo-Bagdad air routes for night flying. In this connexion it is necessary to erect beacons along the Arabian shoies of the Peisian Gulf, and also, if possible, one at Task in Persian territory. Negotiations for permission to erect these beacons are now proceeding. Inter-Command Flights. 267. During January and February four Wapitis and two Victorias proceeded on an inter-command flight from Iraq to Singapore. They leit Shaibah on the 15th January, stayed at Singapore from the 27th to the 31st January, and returned to Shaibah on the 18th February. The flight, which was the first to be undertaken by the Royal Air Force along the Iraq-Smgapore route, was accomplished without incident. Hie distance covered was approximately 10,560 miles. 268. During February and March two Rangoon flying-boats of ^o. 203 (F.B.) Squadron proceeded on an inter-command flight from Iraq to Calcutta via Ceylon. They left Basra on the 1st February, stayed at Calcutta from the 12th to the 20th February, and returned to Basra without incident on the 13th Maich, having covered a distance of approximately 8,000 nautical miles. 269. On the 5th September three Rangoon flying-boats of No. 203 (F.B.) Squadron left Basra for Melbourne to take part in the Melbourne centenary celebrations. They proceeded via the trans-India route (which had been reconnoitred in June) and the eastern coast of Australia, arriving at Melbourne on the 8th October. This was the first time that flying-boats had flown overland across India. Owing to the prevailing monsoon, this stage was made more difficult48 than would normally be the case. They remained at Melbourne until the 10th November, and returned to Basra, by the same route as on the outward flight, on the 20th December, having flown a total distance of approximately 19,400 miles. Search for Missing Aircraft. 270. On three occasions searches for missing civilian aircraft were ^ carried out. 271. In April a search was organised for an Anglo-Persian Oil Company aeroplane which was missing between Kirkuk and Shaibah. Aircraft of Nos. 55, 70 and 84 Squadrons carried out the work, and the missing craft was located near Badra, where it had been forced to land owing to engine failure. 272. During October four Moth machines of the Bombay Flying Club lost their way between Hinaidi and Shaibah, and force-landed in the Southern Desert. One pilot was successful in reaching Shaibah and reported the calculated position of the other three. Intensive search operations were carried out, and on the third day the missing machines were located near Ansab, twenty-nine aircraft of Nos. 30, 55, 70 and 84 Squadrons having covered an area of approxi mately 23,800 square miles, involving 437^ hours’ flying. 273. In December a K.L.M. air liner, flying from Cairo to Bagdad by night under most adverse weather conditions, was reported missing in the neighbour hood of Rutbah. Aircraft of Nos. 30, 55 and 70 Squadrons co-operated with aircraft of No. 14 Squadron from Palestine in the search, which eventually located the liner, crashed and burnt out, approximately 10 miles south of Rutbah. Visit of No. 45 (B) Squadron to Iraq. 274. During October, as a practice for strategic mobility of air forces, No. 45 (B) Squadron visited the Iraq Command from Egypt. The whole squadron had reached Hinaidi by the 19th October, the personnel and stores necessary to maintain the squadron for the period of their stay in Iraq being conveyed by bomber transport aircraft of No. 216 (B.T.) Squadron. While in Iraq, the squadron visited Mosul and Shaibah, in addition to carrying out reconnaissance flights in various parts of the country. They left Hinaidi on their return journey to Egypt on the 6th November. Security of Royal Air Force Stations in Iraq. 275. As a result of the events of 1933, it was necesary to reconsider the question of the defence of Royal Air Force stations and to revise the existing defence schemes. Throughout the year work was carried out on the Hinaidi, Shaibah and Margil defences, and by the end of the year the Hinaidi defence scheme was complete and work at Shaibah and Margil was well in hand. For various reasons it was not found possible to remodel the Mosul defences. Visits of Army Officers to Iraq. 276. Visits were paid to the Iraq Command by army officers from the War Office, Egypt and India, to co-operate in the preparation of defence schemes incidental to the responsibilities now assumed by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom under the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance. They were invited to comment on the security measures already elaborated, and expressed general agreement both with these and with the schemes worked out by the Royal Air Force for the future. A ir Mail between Iraq and Cairo. 277. A weekly air mail between Bagdad and Cairo was maintained by aircraft of the Iraq and Middle East Commands throughout the year. This mail was composed of service secret and confidential correspondence and Foreign Office bags from Bagdad and Tehran for delivery to Cairo for onward despatch by courier. Surveys. 278. During the past year work on the Rutbah sheet of the 1/500,000 map series of the southern and western areas was continued. It is hoped that before next hot weather the field work on the whole series will have been completed.49 The Iraq Levies. Organisation. 279. No change in the establishment or organisation of the Iraq levies has taken place during the year. The levy companies are distributed as follows : at Hinaidi, five Assyrian companies; at Shaibah, one Arab company; at Basra, one Arab company; and at Mosul, one Kurdish company. The Iraqi Army. General. 280. During the year the Headquarters Staff insisted that the Iraqi army is designed primarily to meet external aggression rather than to deal with internal trouble. The official military view, too optimistically perhaps, discounts the probability of serious tribal and other risings. As a result of this policy, the frontiers and the lines of advance into the country from the north and east have received considerable attention, and a request has been put forward by the Iraqi Chief of the General Staff to the British Inspector-General for a definition of the amount of help which Great Britain, as Iraq’s ally, will provide in the event of external aggression. General Bruce Hay has been informed by His Majesty’s « Ambassador that no commitment of any kind can be made on this subject without the approval of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, and that any such communication would have to be made through His Majesty’s Embassy. The Inspector-General has, in the meantime, enquired what forces Iraq can put in the field and what general plan of campaign it is proposed to adopt. Budget. 281. The sum voted for the financial year 1934—35 was 880,080 dinars, and an additional sum of 35,000 dinars has been asked for. Plans have been made for the expenditure, over a period of four years, of 757,900 dinars, this being the portion of the anticipated oil royalties which has been allotted to the Ministry of Defence. Of this amount, 205,000 dinars are to be expended on buildings, which include a new military station at Diwaniyah, extensive barracks at Kirkuk, a Ministry of Defence in Bagdad, magazines at Bagdad, Kirkuk and Mosul, and other much-needed construction. The remaining 552,900 dinars are earmarked to purchase arms, equipment for technical units, gun ammunition, aeroplanes, &amp;c. Orders for approximately 200,000 dinars for guns, ammunition and bridging equipment have already been placed in London. Strength. 282. At the end of 1934 the total strength of the army and air force was 14,364 all ranks, an increase of 2,806 during the past twelve months. This increase is due principally to the formation of one field artillery battery, three frontier battalions and one animal transport company, and to the addition of a fourth platoon to each rifle company. One new Royal Iraqi Air Force squadron was also formed. 283. There is a shortage of officers of 126 out of an establishment of 731. 284. The following fighting units are now in existence :— The Royal Bodyguard (one troop and one platoon). Two cavalry regiments. One field artillery brigade, consisting of two batteries of four 18-pdr. guns, one battery of four 4-5-inch howitzers. One mountain artillery brigade, consisting of two batteries of four 3-7-inch howitzers, one battery of four 2*75-inch guns. Engineer half-company. Signal battalion. Twelve infantry battalions. Three frontier battalions. One section of two armoured cars. One motor machine-gun company of sixteen cars. Two squadrons Royal Iraqi Air Force.50 285. The administrative and training units and services comprise :— One motor transport company. Three animal transport companies. Medical service, including one cadre field ambulance. Veterinary and remount services. Ordnance services, including a small arms ammunition factory. Depots and schools for the various arms and services. Organisation. 286. —(a) The military forces are controlled and administered by the Ministry of Defence. The Defence Council under new regulations adopted in 1934 is composed of— The president— The Chief of the General Staff. Original members— The Adjutant-General. The Quartermaster-General. The Master-General of Provision and Supply. The G.S.O. I. Additional members— Officers especially selected by order of the Minister of Defence or Chief of the General Staff. Military Accountant-General. Secretary— The Secretary of the Ministry of Defence. The Council of Defence assembles under the presidency of the Chief of the General Staff, and, when absent, under that of the senior member of the council. The Minister or the Chief of the General Staff may invite one or more additional members from the senior officers of the army to attend the Defence Council in order to give their opinion on important matters. The Defence Council will meet from time to time to decide on cases referred to them, and decisions will be by the majority of votes of the original members only, which must be submitted to the Minister for approval. In addition, there is a Headquarters Staff organisation, modelled on the British divisional system, with modifications to suit local conditions. 287. — (b) The country is divided into three military districts—Northern, Eastern and Southern—each under the command of an Amir-al-Liwa (brigadier). Northern District — Headquarters: Mosul. Troops— One cavalry regiment. Mountain artillery brigade, less one battery. Three infantry battalions. One frontier battalion. One animal transport company. Ancillary services. One infantry depot. Eastern District — Headquarters: Kirkuk. Troops— One mountain battery. Four infantry battalions. Two frontier battalions. Two animal transport companies. Ancillary services. One infantry depot.Southern District — Headquarters: Bagdad,. Troops— Royal Bodyguard. One cavalry regiment. Field artillery brigade. Engineer half-company. Signal battalion. Five infantry battalions. Section armoured cars. Motor machine-gun company. Motor transport company. Field ambulance (in cadre). Ancillary services. In addition, the following schools, depots, &amp;c., are located in this district:— Staff School. Royal Iraq Military College. Cavalry School and depot. Artillery School and depot. School for n.c.o.’s and small arms. Mechanical Transport School and depot. Small-Arms Ammunition Factory. One infantry depot. The Royal Iraqi Air Force is situated at Hinaidi under independent command (see below). Training. 288. The training of the army has followed the scheme laid down at the beginning of the year, and, though ^ climatic and other reasons militate against the necessary steady progression of training, the results are not unsatisfactory. Much remains to be learnt, more especially in the handling of mounted and motor troops, in staff and command duties, in the dispositions of infantry in defence, and in co-operation between ground and air forces. 289. Units in the Southern District attended “desert warfare” camps near Bagdad, and carried out collective training at Qaraghan. Troops in the Northern and Eastern Districts attended mountain warfare camps m the early summer, and in the autumn were collected for manoeuvres in the area between the Zab’Rivers, some 5,000 all ranks being there exercised. Artillery units went into practice camps, where they showed a very creditable performance. . . p , , Courses of instruction were carried out at all the schools, &amp;c., referred to above, the average standard attained being satisfactory. . , A number of Iraqi officers have been sent to the Lmted Kingdom and to India for courses and attachments, and the results attained ai e most useful to the army and the air force. Armament. 290 The Iraqi army is equipped in accordance with article 6 of the Treaty of Alliance with arms and accoutrements similar to those used in the British army. Cavalry— , . . Sabres, rifles and Vickers machine guns. A decision has been taken to add a Vickers-Berthier machine gun to- pach sabre troop. Artillery— Field artillery— i 2 batteries 18-pounder guns and one battery 4-5-mch howitzers. Mountain artillery— . , , _ « ^ v 2 batteries 3’7-inch howitzers and one battery 2 75-inch guns. In 1935 the third battery will be rearmed with 3’7-inch howitzers. [11315] B 1 ‘52 Armoured cars— Crossley six-wheelers with Vickers and Lewis guns. Further Crossley chassis have been purchased, and the bodies are being designed and will be built locally. The Motor Machine-Gun Company is armed with Vickers machine guns, Lewis guns, rifles and revolvers, carried on 30-cwt. Chevrolets. ^ A small arms ammunition factory with an output of 1^ million rounds per annum has been opened this year in Bagdad. A dministrative Services. 291. There is a marked tendency to starve administrative arms and services in order to produce a larger number of fighting units. This is especially so with the medical and veterinary services, which are under-staffed and quite unready for war. 292. The supply system has been placed on a more satisfactory basis; purchase and issue now being carried out by the Supply Department, and the previous contractors who delivered direct to units have been eliminated. 293. During the manoeuvres the organisation of a sound system of supplies in the field was attempted with promising results. 294. The military works service is at present concerned with design and inspection only, all work being carried out by the Public Works Department of the Ministry of Economics and Communications. This system is unsatisfactory, and a proposal is under consideration for the military works service to be increased and reorganised so that it can carry out all construction by contract or direct labour. Future Policy. 295. During the forthcoming year it is intended to increase all artillery batteries from four to six guns or howitzers, and to form three infantry battalions, utilising for the latter twenty-seven of the new platoons added during this year to existing units. The signal battalion will be increased by three infantry signal platoons and other sections for cable, &amp;c. The field ambulance is to be brought up to within reasonable distance of its war strength. 296. The eventual aim is to have by 1938-39, or earlier, an army of two | divisions and one frontier brigade. A division will contain three brigades each of three battalions, two artillery brigades (totalling twenty-four guns), an engineer company, signal detachments, and the necessary medical, supply and transport units. Whether cavalry are to be part of the division or independent is unsettled. Operations. 297. For the first time since 1914 a year has passed without active operations in Iraq. In May one battalion was moved from Sulaimaniya to the Persian frontier near Halebja to assist the police in the control of trans-frontier raiders, but its activities were confined to patrolling. Only one company now remains there, the remainder of the battalion having been withdrawn to Sulaimaniya. National Service and Reserve Laws. 298. During the year progress has been made with the details of the scheme for putting into force the provisions of the National Service Law, and it has been suggested that the first batch of conscripts will join for training at the beginning of 1936, though no official notification to this effect has as yet been made. A Reserve Law was passed by which serving soldiers were invited, and new recruits and men extending their service are obliged, to join the reserve for a period after finishing their colour service. British Military Mission. 299. The relations with the Iraqi army, which had become distinctly strained in 1933 owing to the unfortunate Assyrian incidents, are again cordial.53 and an increasing desire has been manifested on the part of commanders and btans tor assistance from the personnel of the mission in training, organisation and administration. Conclusion. 300. During the year there has been progress in organisation and training, but until the shortage of officers is met and more care and money are spent on the ancillary units and administrative services it is difficult to forecast how the army would acquit itself in the field. 301. The lack of traditions inherent in such a young country and army is reflected in a low standard of discipline in many units. The punishments awarded by courts-martial often appear quite inadequate, especially in the case of officers. Royal Iraqi Air Force. Operations. 302. Except for a successful air demonstration over the heads of a tribe engaged in smuggling sugar, in the vicinity of Kerbala, there were no operations during the year. Manoeuvres. 303. I he army manoeuvres held in October demonstrated that army and air co-operation requires to be taught and practised by all ranks of the Iraqi army and the Royal Iraqi Air Force. A programme has been prepared and started. Flying. 304. The standard of flying is average. Five Hawker aircraft were flown from England to Bagdad, this being the fourth time that the Royal Iraqi Air Force have successfully done this flight with new aircraft. Shortly afterwards four of these aeroplanes were flown to Angora and back on an official visit, T raining. 305. Towards the end of the year individual training for pilots was started and made promising progress. Flying and other training proceeded normally. The first course of the flying training school concluded with the award of their brevets by His Majesty King Ghazi to the fourteen successful pilots in May. Discipline. 306. Important flying orders, drafted in the interests of safety, continue to be broken without suitable punishment, the offences at times being condoned or most inadequately punished. Discipline and training continue to be subjects for emphasis, and the risk of further unfortunate flying accidents from these causes remains. Personnel. 307. Of the fourteen pilots attached to the Royal Iraqi Air Force during the year three were, unhappily, killed in the only serious flying accident of the year. There are now twenty-two pilots and 154 other ranks. Seven prospective pilots and fifty other ranks are under training. Organisation. 308. The Royal Iraqi Air Force has been reorganised on a station basis, and now consists of the following :— Station headquarters, including the following sections :— Stores, armoury, photographic, parachute and signals. No. 1 (Fighter) Squadron (twelve Hawker Audax aircraft). No. 2 (Communication) Squadron (six D.H. Dragon Moths and four D.H. Puss Moths). Flying Training School (twelve D.H. Gipsy Moths). Aircraft Depot, including an Aeroplane Repair Section, an Engine Repair Section and an Apprentices’ School. This new organisation is flexible and is working well.Future Policy. 309. With another squadron due to be formed at the end of 1936, it is likely that eighteen more pilots and eighty more men will be put under tiainmg during 1935, and that one of the present squadrons will in due course be based on Mosul. 310. It is hoped that training in all branches of army and air co-operation work will be given its proper place this year. Night flying is to be started during the spring. It is intended to order a considerable amount of new equipment, including three new D.H. Tiger Moth aircraft from England.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT A n Printed for the use of the Foreign Office. h^Q (A*. CONFIDENTIAL. (14453) I RAQ.

TWO events occurred during the year which have deeply stirred the emotions of the people of Iraq—the death of King Faisal, and the Assyrian crisis of July and August. 2. King Faisal died suddenly of heart failure in Berne in the early morning of the 8th September. He was 49 years of age and had reigned for twelve years. The rest and medical treatment which he had hoped to enjoy in Switzerland after his visit to the United Kingdom were rudely interrupted by the Assyrian troubles which occurred in Iraq at the end of July. He returned to Bagdad on the 2nd August to face one of the most difficult situations with which he had ever had to deal. He remained for a month, and his health was visibly affected by the intense summer heat and the nervous strain of the crisis. A week after leaving Bagdad on the 1st September to return to Switzerland he was dead. 3. A few hours after the news of his death had been received in Bagdad the Amir Ghazi, his only son, was proclaimed King. The Cabinet immediately placed their resignations in the new King’s hands, but were reappointed without change on the following day. On the 12th September an extraordinary session of Parliament was convoked, and, at a joint meeting of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies, King Ghazi took the prescribed oath of fidelity to the Constitution. Meanwhile, on the 11th September, King Faisal’s body was taken on board H.M.S. Despatch at Brindisi and conveyed to Haifa. There it was transferred to a Royal Air Force troop-carrier and flown to Bagdad, where the funeral took place on the 15th September. The ceremony passed off without incident, in spite of enormous crowds, which at one time threatened to become uncontrollable, and the procession of mourners which thronged the streets on the day of the funeral provided striking testimony to the general grief caused by his 'passing. In political circles, where ^ his shortcomings were realised and often criticised, his death brought with it a keener appreciation of the great work which he had accomplished, and a fresh proof of the old adage that water is not rightly valued until the well runs dry. It was realised that a gap had been made in the political life of the country which would probably never be filled. It was King Faisal who founded the State of Iraq, and who guided it through the many perplexing difficulties which were encountered during the twelve years of his reign, and since his death, those to whom he has left the task of carrying on his work are beginning to appreciate more fully the great burden of responsibility which he bore. It was his skill and political subtlety which enabled him to hold the delicate balance between Sunni and Shia, and through his profound under standing of the Arab mind he was able to deal with turbulent chiefs with a[10072] B 2 3 marked degree of success. In political circles, too, the loss of his guiding hand has been acutely felt. In spite of the faults inherent in his highly strung and imaginative temperament, his noble birth and his romantic leadership of the Arab cause placed him in an exalted position above local party rivalries and personal jealousies, from which he could and did in a very great measure rule as well as 9 reign. His successor, the young Kin^ Ghazi, for some years at any rate, will have to play a less influential role, and, deprived of the control which his father exercised over the governing classes, may not have the wisdom to subordinate party feelings to the interests of the country. 4. As regards the Assyrian crisis, much has been said and much has been misunderstood. The facts, so far as they are known, are set out briefly in Section III of this report. Precision and accuracy regarding the events that preceded and accompanied the crisis will probably remain for ever unattainable. Meanwhile, this can be said without fear of contradiction. The exodus to Syria was no gesture of despair on the part of those Assyrians who took part in it. Every piece of evidence that accumulates goes to show that it was the result of months of careful preparation, and that it was engineered and executed by the patriarchal family, without the knowledge, for the most part, of the rank and file, and in defiance of the League of Nations. Mountaineers were assembled in their hundreds from some of the most prosperous villages in Iraq and marched off in formation over rough country without knowing where or why they were going. 5. It is now beyond doubt that the first shot was treacherously fired from the Assyrian side, and there is every reason to believe that it was fired with the deliberate object of provoking and precipitating a crisis which would focus the fierce light of publicity on Iraq and the Assyrian problem. 6. The Assyrian leaders, having failed to move the Council of the League to accept their exaggerated demands, decided, with an obstinacy and irresponsibility which passes belief, to fall into the mood of Mark Antony : cc Mischief, thou art afoot. Take thou what course thou wilt.” In the event, the innocent suffered and suffered terribly, as they always do; and nowhere more than in the Middle East. 7. Up to the 5th August Iraq could have faced the world, the League, and her critics with an easy conscience. If the subsequent inexcusable and unfor givable savagery of her new-fledged army, reduced to a state of panic by surprise and heavy losses, played into the hands of her opponents, that is not to say that the Assyrian die-hards or their leaders should be allowed to stand before the world as martyrs. 8. Yet this is a view which has been expressed by certain people in England, who ignore, or who are unaware of the patience displayed, in spite of grefat provocation, towards the problem of Assyrian settlement, by the Iraqi Government. 9. There appears to be a school of thought which advocates that, at the first sign of real difficulty, the cable should be cut, the sacrifices of blood and treasure in this country should be forgotten, and the profit which is now accumulating as a result of British policy and enterprise over the last fifteen years should be, abandoned. 10. It is impossible to believe that any serious attention will be paid to these people or that any attempt will be made to retreat from a position so hardly won, and from which the prospects are so favourable—at any rate, not until reasons are forthcoming, infinitely more cogent than any connected with the Assyrian troubles of last summer. 11. Undeniably there have been times during the past year when the Iraqi Government have proved difficult and obstructive. But it was not to be expected that all would be plain sailing with a young State in the first fine careless rapture of independence. Spoon-feeding is good for babes only. Adolescents resent it. For them patience and careful handling are indicated, and none is in a better position to apply these remedies to Iraq than His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom.12. It is at least arguable that Iraq is relatively more profitable and less troublesome than most other foreign States in the world to-day. II.—Foreign Relations. United Kingdom. 13. The relations between His Majesty’s Embassy and the Iraqi Govern ment remained close and cordial throughout the year, except for the period, during the King’s absence and the Assyrian crisis, when the extreme nationalists saw an opportunity of airing their grievances against the Treaty of Alliance and attacking British policy. 14. The Iraqi Government did not hesitate to consult the Embassy frequently on matters of international law, procedure and protocol, and they received unstinted help and guidance. The correspondence thereby entailed with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, added to that necessitated by the presence of the Royal Air Force in Iraq, the British officials’ conditions of service, and the repre sentation of Iraqi interests abroad was necessarily voluminous. King Faisal’s State Visit. 15. King Faisal left Bagdad by air on the 5th June for Amman on the first stage of his journey to London to pay a State visit to their Majesties King George and Queen Mary. He was accompanied by an official suite consisting of Nuri Pasha-al-Said, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Tahsin Beg-al-Qadri, the Chief Master of Ceremonies, an aide-de-camp and a British medical adviser. His Majesty arrived in London on the 20th June and spent two days at Buckingham Palace as the guest of His Majesty King George. On the evening of his arrival, King Faisal attended a State banquet given in his honour at Buckingham Palace, and on the following day he was entertained by the Lord Mayor at a formal luncheon given at the Guildhall. In the evening he attended a dinner at the Foreign Office given by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on behalf of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. On the 22nd June, King Faisal left Buckingham Palace, but remained a few days in London at the Hyde Park Hotel before going to Scotland to make a number of private visits in company with Sir Francis Humphrys. His Majesty left Scotland on the 5th July and proceeded direct to Torquay, where he visited H.M.S. Renown and was present at naval exercises in Tor Bay arranged in his honour. He returned to London on the 6th July and again took up his residence at the Hyde Park Hotel, where he remained until he left for Switzerland on the 20th July. King Faisal appeared to be much impressed by the cordiality of his reception by His Majesty the King and by the ceremonial pageantry of the State visit. Throughout his stay he showed himself most appreciative of the entertainment and hospitality which he received. The Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930. 16. For some weeks prior to the departure of His Majesty’s Ambassador from Bagdad in May, there had been a good deal of agitation in the more extreme organs of the vernacular press against the Treaty of Alliance. Some of the airy and vapid talk of the sacred aspirations of the Iraqi people found its echo in Parliament, and speculation was rife as to whether King Faisal would find an opportunity to broach the question of revision in London. The King deplored current misconceptions and was disgusted at the pusillanimity of his Ministers, all of whom continually professed their anxiety to maintain the closest relations with Great Britain, while none ventured to pull his weight in the settlement of outstanding questions. His Majesty therefore decided that the Government must make an unequivocal statement of policy before his departure for London. The Prime Minister did, in fact, make a statement at the opening of the debate on the budget, but he appeared to be equally nebulous on' the question of Anglo-Iraqi relations and the aspirations of the Iraqi people. The Cabinet at that time, how ever, was hardly representative, and it was probably for this reason that Yasin Pasha, the leader of the Opposition, considered it necessary to describe the treaty as a step forward in the progress of Iraq.5 17. The campaign of slander and defamation of Great Britain, pursued by the more actively hostile of the extreme organs of the press, culminated in August in strong protests by His Majesty’s Embassy, profuse apologies from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the suspension of one paper, and a warning to all the others. IP Position of British Officials. 18. On the 31st January His Majesty’s Ambassador addressed a letter through the British advisers to all British officials in the service of the Iraqi Government, which informed them that, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Alliance, the special relations which had existed since 1920 between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of Iraq had come to an end, and that, consequently, their special responsibilities towards His Majesty’s High Commissioner in Iraq had terminated. 19. The arrangement mentioned in paragraph 9 of the annual report for 1932, whereby the Iraqi Government had agreed that His Majesty’s Ambassador should receive information from the British advisers in the normal course of social relations, was found to work satisfactorily during the year under review. Contracts of British Officials. 20. Having ascertained through the British advisers the opinion of all the British officials in the service of the Iraqi Government in regard to the proposals mentioned in paragraph 103 of the report for 1932, His Majesty’s Ambassador informed the Iraqi Government that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom had no objection to the deletion from existing contracts of all references to the High Commissioner provided the concurrence of each individual British official was obtained, and on the understanding that His Majesty King Faisal would nominate a British official in the service of the Iraqi Government to take the place of the nominee of His Britannic Majesty’s representative on disciplinary boards. The Iraqi Government returned a favourable reply on the 24th October, and by the end of the year little remained to be done to regularise the position for the future. Numbers of British Officials. 21. The Iraqi Government steadily pursued their policy of replacing British officials by Iraqis wherever possible, and the contracts of twenty-four of them were terminated or expired or were not renewed during the year. 22. There was no anti-British drive, however, and at the end of the year eighty-nine British officials still remained in Government employ, not including those in the Iraqi Railways and the Port of Basra. Liaison of His Majesty's Ambassador with the Air Officer Commanding and the Head of the Military Mission. 23. In view of the provisions of the Treaty of Alliance it was felt desirable to obtain the recognition of the Iraqi Government of the necessity for the main tenance of the close liaison which had existed under the mandatory regime between the High Commissioner, the Air Officer Commanding and the head of the military mission. Accordingly, His Majesty’s Ambassador addressed a letter to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on the 11th May in the following terms :— 24. “ In view of those articles of the treaty of 1930 which provide that our respective Governments shall concert together in regard to measures of defence to be taken in time of war or the menace of war, it seems to me essential in the interests of both Governments that the head of the military mission should continue to be free at all times in the future, as in the past, to discuss fully and frankly with His Majesty’s Ambassador and the Air Officer Commanding all schemes put forward for the defence of Iraq and the strength, organisation and disposition of the Iraqi forces. I feel sure that your Excellency will agree that the continued maintenance of close liaison between His Majesty’s Ambassador, the Air Officer Commanding and the head of the military mission will be necessary to enable His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom adequately to fulfil their obligations under the treaty, and I shall be glad to receive an expression of your Excellency’s views on this subject.” [10072] ' B 325. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs had not, in fact, replied in writing to this letter by the end of the year, but there is every reason to believe that the Iraqi Government concur in the proposal. The Royal Air Force. 26. A certain amount of difficulty arose during the year in connexion with article 11 of the Financial Agreement attached to the treaty of 1922, whereby the Iraqi Government agreed to transfer, free of charge, to His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, waste Government land required for military and other purposes. No similar provision exists in the treaty of 1930, and the Iraqi Government appeared to have decided that a number of landing-grounds, which had been taken over by the Royal xUir Force under the treaty of 1922, should now be taken over by the Iraqi Air Force and only made available to the Royal Air Force as and when necessary. His Majesty’s Embassy made it clear that where, as in the case of the landing-ground at Baiji, the Royal Air Force had used a landing-ground uninterruptedly since 1922, it was their intention to stand on their rights and not to allow to pass unchallenged any plea by the Iraqi Government that they were absolved from the terms of the treaty of 1922 in so far as the obligations were incurred thereunder before the coming into force of the treaty of 1930. A similar difficulty was encountered in connexion with an application by the Royal Air Force for the allocation of a piece of ground near the Mosul aerodrome to be made available for bombing and towed-target practice. In this case the application was based on the treaty of 1930, but the Iraqi Government, at the instance of the Ministries of Justice and Finance, put in a demand for rent. This demand was strongly contested by His Majesty’s Embassy, and at the end of the year the controversy was still proceeding. ’ Meanwhile, an important part of the training of the Royal Air Force in this area was held up. Aerodrome Guards. 27 In spite of pressure from His Majesty’s Embassy, the Iraqi Government showed reluctance to take steps for the establishment of the Air Defence Force, provision for which was made in the Secret letter of the 30th June, 1930, from ^uri Pasha. In March a draft law on the subject was produced, but was found to be out of harmony with the terms of the agreement and was dropped. His Majesty’s Ambassador pointed out that the only alternative to legislation was to allow the old levy system to continue; which meant that, pending the enactment of a satisfactory law, the Air Defence Force would remain an integral part of His Britannic Majesty’s forces in Iraq. In the early summer Nuri Pasha’s letter of 1930 became the subject of embittered debates in Parliament, and it became the policy of the Opposition to maintain that the letter had no validity. In these circumstances His Majesty s Government in the United Kingdom concurred in the view of His Majesty’s Ambassador, viz., that, whilst legislation is still necessary, it would be advisable, for the time being, to acquiesce in the present situation On the 14th July a note m this sense was addressed to the Ministry for foreign Affairs, in which it was clearly stated that the responsibility for the consequences of this state of affairs must rest exclusively with the Iraqi Govern ment The note also asked for an assurance that the Iraqi Government would take steps to enact the necessary legislation as soon as possible. 28. No such assurance had been received at the end of the year. A rms and A mmunition. 29. In a note of the 4th January, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs asked for fT 1 n^ n ?^ me rT tS -f t( !i b ^^ nad i e t0r th r j apiC ? SU PP^ t0 Irac l of arms and ammunition from the United Kingdom or India in times of urgent necessity. Owing to technical difficulties no definite prearrangements in the sense suggested could be made but the Ministry for Foreign Affairs were assured that everything possible would be done to secure that the urgent requirements of the Iraqi Government should be met. ^ 4 . ^ i I ra( P Government had throughout the year shown great anxiety to model their arms and ammunition on the British pattern, and have evinced no desire whatever to depart from their treaty obligations in this respect.[10072] b 4 7 31. Several officers and men of the Iraqi police and army were sent for courses of instruction during the year to the United Kingdom and India. Advisory Military Mission. 32. Under the agreement reached between the High Commission and the Iraqi Government prior to the termination of the mandate, the cadre of officers of the Advisory Military Mission which the Iraqi Government desired to employ with the Iraqi army was fixed at eleven army officers and three officers of the Royal Air Force, together with some British non-commissioned officers required for service with the Iraqi Air Force. The termination of the mandate necessitated a number of alterations in the wording of the contract for military officers, and the Iraqi Government took advantage of this opportunity to press for a complete revision of the rates of pay and conditions of service. It was agreed in an annexure to the Treaty of Alliance that the officers of the Advisory Military Mission were to be employed on conditions of service similar to those of the , military mission previously employed. Agreement was finally reached between the two Governments on a reduction of 10 per cent, in the rates of pay, and two small alterations in the allowances. The textual alterations which the Iraqi Government wished to make in the conditions of service, although not of great importance in principle, involved considerable correspondence and delay. The preoccupation of the Iraqi Government wuth the Assyrian disturbance also delayed the negotiations and, as the Iraqi Government refused to agree to the engagement of any new officers until the revised conditions were completely and finally settled, the number of officers serving with the mission had dwindled i to four by the end of the year. The rapid reduction in numbers was assisted by | the fact that four officers who had been offered an extension of their contract withdrew their acceptance after the Assyrian troubles had arisen. An additional flying officer instructor from the Royal Air Force was appointed during the year in order to give effect to the policy of training Iraqi pilots locally, instead of jj sending them for attachment to Royal Air Force units in the United Kingdom. The revised conditions of service had not been settled by the end of the year. 33. The functions of the mission were also passed under review, and the Inspector-General submitted proposals which provided for the supply of information direct to the War Office, Air Ministry and the Air Officer Commanding in regard to the strength, organisation, command, moral and general fighting capacity of the Iraqi army and in connexion with all questions of national defence. A redistribution of the functions of the military members of the mission was also suggested in order more efficiently to cope with the altered conditions. Shatt-al-Arab Conservancy Board. 34. No action was taken vis-d-vis the Iraqi Government regarding the proposal for the establishment of a tripartite conservancy board, on which Persia shall be represented, to control the Shatt-al-Arab, which has been under consideration for some years; it being considered preferable to allow the Iraqi Government themselves to broach the subject. The text of the convention was, however, revised to make it ready for presentation when the opportune moment arrives. The Iraqi Government made a number of oral complaints regarding the difficulties caused by Persian warships in the Shatt-al-Arab and the danger of accident inherent in their refusal to obey the port navigation rules, but did not pursue the matter to a point where discussions regarding the establishment of the Conservancy Board could be resumed. There were, however, distinct signs at the end of the year that the Iraqi Government favoured the establishment of the board as a possible solution of the difficulties in the Gulf. Antiquities Law. 35. Archaeology unfortunately came “ into politics ” in the course of the year, the various foreign expeditions working in Iraq becoming a target for narrow and ignorant nationalism. The trouble began with the refusal of the Minister of Education in the Rashid Ali Cabinet to grant a permit for the export of the excavators’ share of the objects discovered in the 1932-33 season at Tel Arpachiyah by the British Museum Expedition under the supervision ofMr. Mallowan. The division of antiquities had been carried out at Arpachiyah, as at other sites, by the Director of Antiquities in accordance with the existing law of 1924 (drafted by Miss Gertrude Bell), which provides that the excavator himself shall receive an “adequate” and “representative shaie of all antiquities after the needs of the Iraqi Museum have been satisfied. 1 he Minister, an ignorant and fanatical Shiah, based his refusal of the export permit on the ground that he had issued an “ instruction previous to the actual division to the effect that only “ actual duplicates should be permitted to leave the country, and he alleged that the director had disobeyed his orders. Although the Minister of Education obtained the support of the Ministry of Justice, his action was clearly a discriminatory contravention of the existing law. Urgent and repeated representations were therefore made by His Majesty s Ambassador to the Iraqi Government. Finally, after much concern had been expressed in archaeological circles in the United Kingdom and other countries, the Council of Ministers decided in October to override the Minister of Education and to allow the export of the British Museum’s share of the antiquities. 36. At the same time a serious situation arose out of the expressed intention of the Minister of Education to introduce a new Antiquities Law. A draft was prepared by the Minister himself and by the senior Iraqi official in the museum, an individual who has incessantly intrigued against the German Director of Antiquities, Dr. Jordan. Its terms were such as would have precluded a continuation of work by almost all foreign archaeological expeditions in Iraq. This proposal became known outside Iraq and caused protest by archaeological bodies in the United Kingdom, France, Germany and the United States of America. His Majesty’s Ambassador urged on the Iraqi Government the harm which they were doing to their country’s reputation and prestige by countenancing proposals which would exclude foreign archaeological expeditions from Iraq, and he was finally successful in extracting a promise from Nuri Pasha, on behalf of the Iraqi Government, that the 1924 law would continue in operation throughout the 1933-34 excavation season, and that no new draft law would be presented to Parliament without the interests of foreign archaeologists being preserved by prior consultation of their diplomatic representatives at Bagdad. The Electric Light Boycott. 37. Towards the end of September a movement was started in Bagdad to boycott the Bagdad Electric Light and Power Company—a British registered company—on the ground that their charges for current (28 fils : 6fd. a unit) were excessive, notwithstanding that such charges were in accordance with the company’s concession. The chief supporters of the boycott were coffee-shop owners, who are apt to consume electricity excessively to attract custom. They complained of the expense entailed; and not without some show of reason. The professional organisers of trade guilds, of whom Muhammad Salih-al-Qazzaz is the most prominent, are all frequenters of the coffee-shops, and resolved to profit by agitating against the company, which, being a foreign organisation, was the more open to attack. Some Jews of Bagdad, with the flair of their race, scented good business. They realised that if electricity was boycotted, people would still need lights (especially the coffee-shop keepers). They, therefore, made a corner in lamps of all kinds and apparently provided the agitators with a share of their 1U? i S - The press then realised the copy value of the boycott, and worked it up sedulously calling on every patriotic citizen to join in the struggle against the foreign colonising capitalists, who were sucking the lifeblood of the nation. Vorkmg hand-in-hand with the agitators they succeeded in stirring up a certain amount of excitement among the students, and these, with a handful of town toughs, successfully intimidated practically all the shopkeepers and most hotel pioprietors into joining the boycott. They also attempted to interrupt the company s work by assaulting their employees. Representations were immediately made by His Majesty s Ambassador, effective protection was provided by the Government and this hooliganism was stopped. The Government also entered into negotiations with the company, and in December obtained a reduction of a , u ? lt: n ! the r f t ® barged for current. This reduction was much less than the agitators demanded, but the public by this time were heartily tired of the otI ebusniess and decisive action by the Government became possible. On the 27th December Muhammad Salih-al-Qazzaz and eight of his associates were[10072] B 5 arrested on a charge of causing public disorder and sentenced to be placed under police supervision for six months. They were thereupon ordered to leave Bagdad and to live in Sulaimani. When the year ended, although some shopkeepers were still using oil lamps, the number of those who were returning to electricity was steadily increasing, and the boycott was definitely broken. Civil Procedure Convention. 38. In April negotiations were opened for the conclusion of a Civil Procedure Convention with the Iraqi Government to facilitate legal proceedings between parties in the United Kingdom and Iraq. These negotiations had not terminated at the end of the year. League of Nations. Disarmament. 39. Previous to May 1933, Iraq had no delegate at the Disarmament Conference. In that month, however, when the question of aerial disarmament came up for discussion, Jafar Pasha, the Minister in London, was appointed Iraqi representative and received instructions to make a statement on behalf of the Iraqi Government, the wording of which was the subject of some correspondence between London and Bagdad. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom were desirous that, in view of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930, the Iraqi representative should make no statement which would in any way restrict the use of the Royal Air Force in Iraq for the purposes contemplated by the 1930 treaty. The Iraqi Government were accordingly requested, and eventually agreed to instruct Jafar Pasha to act in co-operation with the British delegate. This he did, and at the sixty-eighth meeting of the Disarmament Conference he made a declaration with reference to article 34 of the Draft Disarmament Convention, to the effect that the Iraqi Government retained the right to employ air action of any kind within the limits of its territory. In November, however, the Iraqi Government, influenced, it is alleged, by adverse criticism of this retention of a right wider than what was claimed by most of the other Powers represented at the conference, expressed the intention of making a declaration of narrower scope. His Majesty’s Ambassador drew the attention of the Iraqi Government to the matter, and a few days after the close of the year reported that he had persuaded the Minister for Foreign Affairs to take no further action until the question should be reopened by the Disarmament Conference, and in any event to instruct the Iraqi representative to keep in close touch with the United Kingdom delegate. The International Labour Office. 40. Towards the close of 1932 the Iraqi Government received an invitation from the International Labour Office to send a delegation consisting of a repre sentative of employers, of labour, and of the Iraqi Government to the preparatory conference held at Geneva on the 10th January, with a view to make recommenda tions to the World Economic Conference. The Iraqi Government decided that, in existing circumstances, they could not make any effective contribution to the pre paratory conference, and that, consequently, the expense of sending a delegation would not be justified. 41. In November a draft Labour Law was prepared in view of the obliga tions devolving upon Iraq under article 23 {a) of the Covenant of the League, but by the end of the year it had not been approved by the Cabinet, and the text is consequently subject to amendment. It contains no reference to a minimum wage, and as regards hours of labour there are ambiguously-worded provisions concern ing hours of rest. There is also a limited scheme of workmen’s compensation. The Bahai Houses. 42. No progress was made during the year under review towards implementing the undertaking given by the Iraqi Government for the expropria tion of the Bahai Houses for the public benefit, and for their maintenance substantially intact, as the Bagdad Town Planning Scheme, of which this expropriation was a part, had not yet been commenced.cnii' ; 11^1% 10 43 Mr. Mountford Mills visited Bagdad in the spring and discussed the situation thoroughly with the King and the competent Ministers Before he left he informed His Majesty’s Ambaslador that he was satisfied with the assurances which he had obtained. France. . . 44. France is always viewed from Iraq through the Syrian prism, with the result that the image is sometimes distorted. This year tw &lt;&gt; incidents served to ffive it a high colour : (1) The adamant French attitude towards the Ilaqi Govern ment when an imvasse was reached over the demarcation of the L aqi-Synan frontier: (2) the action of the French in allowing the rearmament of the Assyrians across the river and their return, armed, into Iraq. Over this latter point, especially, relations became very strained for a time, and the Iraqi Government protested to the League of Nations. 45. There is undoubtedly an impression in Iraq that the French have no real intention to leave Syria, and that they view with apprehension the prospect of Iraq prosuerous and independent, because it is a permanent incenti\e 0 k ^ riai ) Nationalists and because it stands in the way of the French policy of eastward expansion, signs of which are certainly not wanting (see Section V). Ibis suspicion is only increased by the reported efforts ot the French to dangle the / Syrian Throne before the eyes of King Ali in return for his influence with the Iraqi Government in the direction of a favourable commercial treaty with byria. Italy. 46. In February the Italian Charge d’Affaires enquired, on instructions from Rome, whether King Faisal would be prepared to make a State \isit to the King of Italy after leaving London in the summer. This invitation, which was renewed by Signor Mussolini in August, was declined, but the Italian Legation were given to understand that His Majesty would be happy to visit Rome in 1934. U This Italian eagerness for personal contact with the King may be ascribed to a desire to seize every opportunity of filling with Italians any vacancies occurring amongst the British military and civil advisory staffs. It may also be that the Italian Government wished to give proof of their enthusiasm for the Hashimite dynasty as a counter to French inducements regarding the Syrian Throne, and as a move in their intrigues against Ibn Saud, of which the Italian Legation in Bagdad is suspected of being the centre. Koweit. Properties of the Sheikh of Koweit in Iraq. Law Suits. 47. Although much consideration was given to the unfortunate position in which the Sheikh of Koweit had been placed by the existence of flaws in his title deeds relating to the large Faddaghiyah Estate, which has been in the possession of his family since 1908, no progress was made by the claimants to the property towards establishing their claims in the Iraqi Law Courts. The sheikh has taken refuge in the contention that as a sovereign ruler he has immunity from the jurisdiction of the Iraqi courts, and he has consistently refused to accept service of summons sent to him either direct by the courts or through His Majesty’s Embassy, while registered letters bearing the imprint of emanation from the same source have also been rejected. These tactics have revealed a weak spot in Iraqi law relating to substituted service of judicial documents, and appear to have blocked, for the present at least, the actions brought against the sheikh. The Iraqi Government have not admitted the sheikh’s plea of immunity, and may pass fresh legislation as soon as convenient providing new devices for ensuring service. 48. The breathing space occasioned by these delays has afforded a valuable opportunity for preparing every possible method of defence for use if and when the case does come into court, although the odds are still markedly against the sheikh. Meanwhile, other methods of securing his title to the land and preventing the case from coming to court are being considered. There is no doubt that the technical flaws in the sheikh’s title have roused the cupidity of[10072] B 6 11 certain unscrupulous Basra lawyers, and the difficulties are not diminished by the fact that the man who was Minister of Justice throughout the greater part of the year is himself a Basra lawyer, and has now returned to the bar with complete inside knowledge of the ramifications of the case. The suit against the sheikh is remarkable for two things :— {a) The plaintiff is a pauper, suing in forma pauperis. (b) The property is to-day worth considerably less than what was paid for it in 1908. 49. For reasons similar to those given above no change had taken place in the position of the small estate called the Bashiyah, in respect of which judgment has actually been given against the sheikh as the result of an action brought by a descendant of the original vendor claiming one-fifth of the property. Further action has been blocked and the institution of similar suits by other descendants has been prevented by the inability of the courts to serve legal documents on the sheikh. It is hoped that it may be possible to dispose of these claims also without further recourse being had to legal action. Revenue Exemption. 50. Beyond the submission of formal protests by the Sheikh of Koweit and the former Sheikh of Mohammerah against the action of the Iraqi Government in taking istihlak tax on the produce of their gardens in Iraq, which are covered by the promise of revenue exemption given on behalf of His Majesty’s Govern ment in 1914, no movement of importance took place in this controversy. At the end of the year both sheikhs, who had previously been given official warning to keep a careful account of the losses which they claim to have sustained by the introduction of the istihlak tax, were requested by His Majesty’s Embassy to submit detailed accounts for examination. There is good reason to believe that the extent of these losses will amount to much less than has been estimated in the past. No decision has yet been reached upon the question of compensating the sheikhs for the alleged losses caused by the change in the form of revenue taxation in Iraq, nor have the Iraqi Government relaxed in their refusal to admit any responsibility whatever for the fulfilment of the 1914 promises. Fao Estate. 51. During the year the sheikh experienced trouble with the cultivators of his large Fao estate, a truculent section of whom showed unwillingness to hand over to his agent his share of the crop, and behaved generally in an obstructive and defiant manner. The sheikh’s title in this particular estate, which is the largest and most valuable of his holdings in Iraq, rests in a deed of gift given to the Ruling Family of Koweit some 200 years ago. He possesses no Tapu title deeds, and the action of the cultivators was probably inspired by the coterie of lawyers referred to in the preceding paragraphs as part of their angling in troubled waters. As the sheikh was genuinely alarmed at this new development, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, at his request, asked the Iraqi Government to issue instructions to the mutessarif at Basra to grant the sheikh’s agent at Fao such support as might be necessary to preserve his legal rights and to bring the situation under effective control. Enquiries made into the disturbances showed that they had their origin in a dispute between the sheikh and the cultivators as to the division of the produce of the gardens subsequent to the introduction of the istihlak tax, and there was no doubt that outside a encouragement was given to the recalcitrant cultivators to refuse to acknowledge v/ the sheikh’s authority. The local officials of the Iraqi Government gave official/[ support to the sheikh’s agent, and an amicable settlement was made, although !j not until after the sheikh had been put to some loss because of the delay in obtaining his share of the crops. Smuggling. 52. The difficulties between Iraq and Koweit over the question of contra band trade from Koweit became more tense during the year. Low tariff rates in Koweit undoubtedly provide a strong incentive to use that territory as an entrepot for smuggling goods into Iraq, and the existence of this traffic has long been a thorn in the flesh of the Iraqi customs authorities. There is a wide divergency between the estimates of the officials of Iraq and Koweit as to them 12 volume of this illicit traffic and the loss thereby occasioned to Iraqi revenues, but it is undisputed that it is rife. Early in the year the Iraqi Government suggested, through His Majesty’s Embassy and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, that the Sheikh of Koweit should co-operate with them in the institution of preventive measures to combat smuggling, and suggested some definite measures. The sheikh returned a friendly but indefinite reply. Matters were not improved w by the occurrence of two fatal affrays, one in April and one in October, between an armed launch of the Iraqi Customs Department and alleged smugglers, in which three Koweitis were killed and four wounded. Both these incidents formed the subject of strong protests by and on behalf of the Sheikh of Koweit, on the ground that there was no proof that the men were smuggling and that the attack by the customs launch was made outside Iraqi territorial waters. The accounts given of the incidents are so contradictory that it is practically impossible to form an opinion as to the truth. The opinions expressed by both sides regarding the boundaries of the territorial waters of Koweit and Iraq showed that there was considerable vagueness as to the limits of territorial waters. A proposal made by the Political Resident in the Gulf, that an Iraqi customs official should go to Koweit and talk over the smuggling problem in a friendly way with the customs officials there, was negatived by the Iraqi Govern ment, who stated that they were only prepared to discuss definite measures of co-operation, either those suggested by themselves or practical alternatives put forward by the Sheikh of Koweit. Towards the end of the year, His Majesty’s Embassy persuaded the Iraqi Government to agree to invite Koweiti repre sentatives to Bagdad to discuss the whole question of smuggling and its attendant problems, and arrangements for the conference were under consideration at the end of the year. Post and Telegraph Services in Koweit. 53. The negotiations between the Iraqi Government and the Sheikh of Koweit (mentioned in paragraph 40 of the annual report for 1932) continued throughout the year in a desultory fashion, without the question of the future of the Post and Telegraph Office in Koweit being settled. The sheikh intimated his willingness early in the year to allow the Iraqi Government to continue to work the office for a period of fifteen years subject to an annual subsidy to himself of 16,200 rupees and the grant of certain personal privileges. These conditions, in particular the proposed subsidy, were not acceptable to the Iraqi Government, and since the Government of India were not prepared to take over the service, the 1 olitical Resident in the Persian Gulf felt obliged to intervene in the dispute to prevent a situation arising in which Koweit might be deprived of all post and telegi aphic facilities. Colonel Fowle suggested that an arrangement might be acceptable to both sides by which the sheikh took a fixed proportion of the profits on 1 j 6 , ^, e °^ ce &gt; and, as a preliminary, the Iraqi Government were fL s , ve( Majesty s Embassy for a detailed statement of the financial position. I he reply of the Iraqi Government to this demarche was to produce some figures calculated to show that the net revenue taken by the Koweit branch office was considerably less than the expenditure incurred in its operation. These figures ! ar ® probably pot entirely accurate, but they have been communicated to the sheikh land his reaction is awaited. i\orway. 54. A commercial modus vivendi between Iraq and Norway was concluded by an exchange of notes at Angora, coming into effect on the 1st April, 1933.

JT hjte Bagdad papeis reflected the anti-Zionist tone of the vernacular pi ess in Palestine during the year, and in June an attempt was made to work up a boycott of Jewish goods. Following upon the riots in Jerusalem in the autumn,181 [10072] b 7 13 demonstrations were planned by the extremists in Eagdad to express sympathy with the Palestine Arabs. His Majesty’s Ambassador represented to the King the undesirability of such demonstrations, and asked him to forbid them absolutely. This was done, and the Ministry of the Interior issued the necessary orders. Persia. 56. The accord 'provisoire of August 1929 regulating Iraqi-Persian relations was, by mutual agreement, again extended during the year. 57. In October, Saiyid Baqir Khan Khazemi, the Persian Minister at Bagdad, left for Tehran on his appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs. Inayatullah Khan Sami, his successor, had not arrived at the end of the year. Proposed Treaties between Iraq and Persia. 58. At the close of the year 1932 the Persian Minister in Bagdad com municated to the Iraqi Government the texts, as a basis for discussion, of live draft treaties. These were a Treaty of Friendship, a Treaty of Neutrality, a Residence Treaty, an Extradition Treaty, and a Treaty of Commerce and Naviga tion. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs transmitted to His Majesty’s Embassy copies of these drafts for the comments and advice of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. His Majesty’s Ambassador, after submitting the drafts to London, informed the Ministry for'Foreign Affairs that in his opinion the effect of the Persian drafts was, in general, to ignore the proposals already put forward by the Iraqi Government in the recent past, and consequently slight regard was paid to conditions as they actually existed, and a number of important questions were left untouched. The draft treaty of Friendship, for example, appeared to be little more than an expression of pious hope, no provision being made for the recognition of the frontier of 1914, or for the reference of disputes of a serious nature to the League of Nations. Nor did the draft safeguard the agreement set forth in Annex I of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance for the permanent precedence enjoyed by His Majesty’s Ambassadors in Iraq. With regard to the draft Treaty of Neutrality, His Majesty’s Ambassador suggested that the Iraqi Government would be well advised not to proceed with the negotiation of such an instrument on the terms proposed by the Persian Government, as His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom would feel bound, in view of the Anglo-Iraqi treaty of 1930, to oppose the proposal that Iraq should make an unqualified under taking to maintain neutrality towards a third Power. With regard to the Treaty of Residence (Establishment Convention), the Iraqi Government would, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Ambassador, be well advised to endeavour to secure a larger measure of reciprocity with a view to obtaining for Iraqi nationals in Persia, treatment in fact as favourable as that accorded to Persian nationals in Iraq. It was also suggested that Iraq should endeavour to reach agreement with Persia concerning the nationality of persons of Persian descent, resident in Iraq, whose nationality was under dispute. The draft Extradition Treaty omitted mention of all the amendments proposed by the Iraqi Government to a similar treaty drafted by the Persian Government a few years ago. His Majesty's Ambassador advised that the Iraqi Government should insist on their own draft of an Extradition Treaty being used as a basis of discussion, and that provision should also be made that neither party should be obliged to surrender nationals of third parties unless the State of which they were nationals had an extradition treaty with the party who applied for extradition. Commenting on the draft Treaty of Commerce, His Majesty’s Ambassador suggested that the Iraqi Govern ment should endeavour to have a provision inserted providing for two months' notice of any restrictions or prohibitions of imports, and for denunciation of the treaty if any such restriction proved damaging to the commerce of the other party. Attention was also drawn to the necessity of ensuring that Iraq should be free to give special treatment to Turkey, and to States in Asia detached from Turkey by the Treaty of Lausanne. 59. No further progress was made in the negotiation of these treaties during the year under review. 60. The Persian Government subsequently transmitted to the Iraqi Govern ment a draft agreement concerning the exploitation of oil products from the14 territory situated between the existing Iraqi-Persian frontier, and the old frontier between Persia and the Ottoman Empire prior to the demarcation of 1913—14. It was proposed that the oil products in this zone should be jointly exploited and shared, and that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company should have the sole right of producing oil from deposits in that zone which might extend into Iraqi territory. As this draft primarily affects country which is entirely Iraqi |^ v and only contemplates its application to Persian territory after an exhaustive survey of the transferred territories, the Iraqi Government informed the Persian Government that the agreement could not be discussed on the basis proposed. 61. No progress was made during the year with the proposed agreement for judicial co-operation between the two countries. Frontier Incidents (Shatt-cd-Arab). 62. Several unfortunate incidents took place on the Iraqi-Persian frontier during the year, particularly in the Shatt-al-Arab area, occurrences which in most cases were provoked by the Persians with a view to expressing their disapproval of the existing boundary. 63. In January a Koweiti dhow, with a cargo of sugar for Fao, was arrested in Iraqi territorial waters by the Persian Customs and taken up the Shatt-al-Arab to a place on the Persian bank, on a charge of attempted smuggling. This case raised two issues: (1) The action taken against a British-protected (Koweiti) subject; and (2) the violation of Iraqi territorial waters. In August a Koweiti water dhow in the Shatt-al-Arab was also arrested by the Persian police and the crew ill-treated. No satisfaction was obtained in either case. 64. The Persian navy also made a regular practice of ignoring the naviga tion regulations of the Shatt-al-Arab and of the dredged channel of approach, to the great danger of shipping, particularly of the Anglo-Persian Company’s oil- tankers loading their inflammable cargo at Abadan. 65. On the 12th March the Royal Fleet Auxiliary War Sirdar ran aground on Mawiyah Island in the Shatt-al-Arab, which was Persian territory. The ship lay on a tide-washed mudbank, on which were a few reed fish traps, some of which were crushed. All efforts to refloat the vessel by the aid of tugs and the laying out of anchors having failed, the Port Director, Basra, ordered dredging operations to be commenced. On two occasions the Persian authorities intervened and ordered the dredging to cease. The ship, after being aground for a week, was eventually refloated by the aid of tugs and anchors and with a favourable wind and tide. 66. Towards the close of the year the Persian warship Shah Baaz, by a flagi ant breach of the navigation rules of the Rooka channel (the dredged approach to the bhatt-al-Arab estuary), caused a British oil-tanker to run aground in order to avert a collision. 67. I he Persian navy have also proved ultra-sensitive on the subject of inter national compliments paid at sea. The failure of the Port of Basra steam ship Nearchus engaged on lighthouse inspection duties in the Persian Gulf, when anc ored off Henjam, to dip her colours to a passing Persian warship, was made the subject of an official complaint. Land Frontier. 68. The land fiontier, too, has also been the scene of several incidents. TWa?™ r - y 1 fn J f D n ary t - he r ei ^ ian Minist er complained to the Ministry for OffiPA? n h ?i Captam de £ aur y&gt; the Royal Air Force Special Service ‘?pnmni?i^ da h ! if d ^ Kurds against the Persians on the frontier— a complaint which proved to be as unfounded as it was impertinent. Pp hlri f f U ^ e11 ^^ a a oonference was held in March between Iraqi and Ihp nrnhDm^Po todlsc oss frontier affairs in general, and in particular Persmn Th by ^ har bouring in Iraqi territory of rebellious not rSulfm any ' a fnendl y s P lrlt ’ but dld[10072] B 8 71. In the spring the alleged presence of Russians in survey parties on the Persian side of the Suleimaniya frontier and rumours regarding visits by Communists for political propaganda to Kirkuk, Rowanduz and Suleimaniya, did not escape the attention both of the Iraqi Government and of His Majesty’s Embassy. No further information was subsequently forthcoming. 72. The strengthening by the Persians of their military posts near the Kurdistan frontier in June caused some concern to the Iraqi Government. The reason for this was understood to be the suppression of smuggling. 73. Between the 24th and 28th August three minor affrays took place in the Diala and Suleimaniya areas in Iraqi territory between Persian brigands and Iraqi police, with the result that two of the latter and some animals were killed. The Iraqi Government addressed, on the 4th September, a strong protest to the Persian Legation. Incidents Affecting British Interests. 74. On the 23rd June Captain Macleod, a British subject and Assistant Harbourmaster at Abadan, on boarding a Persian warship in Iraqi waters under a misunderstanding that his services were required, was placed under arrest and imprisoned at Mohammerah for one week. After representations by His Majesty’s Legation and the Iraqi Legation at Tehran, he was released, but neither expression of regret nor offer of compensation was forthcoming from the Persian Government. 75. The British-owned newspaper, Bagdad Times, was, on the 13th January, suspended by the Iraqi Government on the demand of the Persian Government for reproducing extracts from articles in the London press containing offensive references to the Shah. The editor of the Bagdad Times, both personally and publicly, made an apology to the Persian Minister. As a result of informa representations by His Majesty’s Ambassador, the period of suspension was reduced from four weeks to fourteen days. 76. During this time the Basra edition, known as the Times of Mesopotamia, was circulated in Bagdad. When the suspension was over, the Bagdad Times reappeared as the Iraq Times. Proposals for Frontier Rectification. 77 In the month of March the Persian Minister in Bagdad approached Nuri Pasha, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, with a request to enter into negotiations for a rectification of the whole Iraqi— Persian frontier. He stated that the Shah would claim sovereignty over half of the Shatt-al-Arab. ^uri Pasha replied that the Iraqi Government declined to reopen the frontier question and would not surrender sovereign rights inherited from the Ottoman Empire. They would, nevertheless, be willing to discuss in a friendly spirit any question regarding the navigation of the Shatt or the working of the Khanakin oil-field on^both sides of the frontier as a single unit. 78. In May the Persian Minister repeated this request to King Faisal and received a similar reply. 79. This uncompromising attitude of the Iraqi Government contributed no doubt to the oral representations which the Persian Charge d’Affaires was instructed to make to the Head of the Eastern Department of the Foreign Office on the 4th August, in which an attempt was made to hold His Majesty s Govern ment responsible for the present unsatisfactory situation. Saudi Arabia. 80. In a personal letter to His Majesty s Ambassador in Decembei Kine; Ibn Saud referred gratefully to the friendly relations which had existed between Iraq and Saudi Arabia throughout 1933, which he rightly described as leaving little to be desired. 81. There was some inter-tribal raiding in the spring, and in Febiuaiy Ibn Baud’s tax collectors crossed the frontier near Busaiyah and attempted to16 collect grazing tax from certain tribes in Iraq. Representations were made through the Iraqi representative at Jedda, and the withdrawal of the party was accomplished without further incident. 82. In accordance with article 8 of the Iraqi-Saudi Treaty of Friendship, signed in 1931, the Commandant of the Southern Desert Police paid an official visit to Jauf in May, and discussed with the Saudi provincial Governor the ^ measures necessary to check raiding on the Iraqi-Nejd border. A broad basis of ' settlement was reached, a number of claims were settled, and conversations were continued throughout the year regarding the settlement of outstanding cases. 83. In the same month Sheikh Ibrahim-bin-Muammar was appointed Saudi representative at Bagdad. He arrived in June. 84. The suppression by Ibn Saud of the Rifada revolt in 1932 seems to have convinced King Faisal that the time was not ripe for the active pursuit of the Hashimite cause in Saudi Arabia. In August King Faisal telegraphed direct to Ibn Saud appealing to him “in the name of his brothers, the Arabs of other countries,” to bring about a peaceful settlement of the dispute with the Imam Yahya of Yemen. King Faisal offered his services as mediator, with the object of avoiding fratricidal strife and the shedding of Arab blood. King Ibn Saud returned a polite but non-committal reply. Hashimite Properties. 85. The strained relations between King Ibn Saud and the Amir Abdullah of Transjordan prevented progress being made in the settlement of these claims during the first half of the year, and the Iraqi Government invoked the good offices of His Majesty’s Embassy in April on behalf of King Faisal and King Ali. The advice of His Majesty’s Ambassador was that it would be well for the Iraqi Government to send a properly-qualified representative to handle this delicate business at Jedda. Generally the attitude of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom remained benevolent, but non-committal. 86. With the detente in the relations between King Ibn Saud and the Amir Abdullah, progress was made in the summer. The Saudi Government expressed then intention to relax, without removing, their control over the properties, and tendeied a payment in respect of sums due to three of the co-proprietors—• King Faisal, King Ali and the Amir Abdullah. Spain. are two tariffs—a minimum one for goods from States wi which Spain has most-favoured-nation agreements, and a maximum one for o | eis - When Uaq became an independent State, the maximum tariff automatically applied, and the Spanish import duty on Iraqi dates became three ^imes as igh as that on Persian dates.

The Iraqi delegate accordingly withdrew and refused to take any further part in the work of the commission. The French Government once more requested the good offices of His Majesty’s Government with a view to persuade the Iraqi Government to accept the rulings of the chairman. On the 25th May the Minister for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires that the Iraqi Government would do so on the under standing that technical experts would make certain readjustments in the autumn. He added that, in the opinion of his Government, there was no further need for Colonel Iselin’s services. He subsequently informed the French Charge d’Affaires that the Iraqi Government considered Colonel Iselin’s appointment as terminated as from the 15th June. The French Government decided to refer the case to the Council of the League. This was eventually found to be unnecessary, as on the 3rd July an agreement was signed at Geneva between the Iraqi and French Governments according to which all the arbitral decisions of Colonel Iselin were accepted and the demarcation was to be completed forthwith by technical experts. This was done by the 1st August. General. 89. At the beginning of the year the question of an agreement between Iraq and Syria for the exemption of certain classes of travellers from visa fees, was under consideration. The claim of the French authorities for special treatment for French missionaries had in 1932 been brought to the notice of the British High Commission by the Iraqi Government, as the French had offered reciprocal privileges for British missionaries. His Majesty’s Embassy informed the Iraqi Government that a reference to British missionaries would be inappropriate in an agreement between Iraq and Syria, and that it was for the Iraqi Government and the French High Commission to decide whether the proposed agreement should contain any reference to French missionaries. The Iraqi Government eventually decided to suspend the negotiations. 90. At a meeting held in Mosul on the 24th March between French and Iraqi frontier authorities, a provisional agreement was concluded for the main tenance of order on the sector of the frontier covered by the Syrian Euphrates Province and the Iraqi Liwa of Mosul. 91. A draft Agreement of Neighbourly Relations between Iraq and Syria was also prepared by the Acting Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior in accordance with the decision of the Council of the League, the 3rd October, 1932, but no further action was taken during the course of the year. Transjordan. Proposed Customs Agreement. 92. A proposal put forward, in pursuance of article 3 of the Iraq-Trans- jordan Treaty of Friendship, for an agreement to facilitate travel and freer trade between Iraq and Transjordan, came under consideration during the year. Discussion centred on the question whether such an agreement could be reconciled with article 18 of the mandate and the guarantees given by Iraq to the League of Nations. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom approved the proposal in principle. (Information regarding communications between Iraq and Transjordan will be found in Section V of this report.) Frontier Relations. 93. During the first half of the year a few minor looting raids into Trans jordan by tribesmen operating from Iraq were, at the instance of the Transjordan Government, brought to the notice of the Iraq Government, who showed every desire to co-operate in apprehending the culprits. In some cases they were successful and the loot was restored to its rightful owners. 94. In March the Iraqi Government concurred in arrangements for a visit by Captain Glubb to the Mutessarif of the Dulaim Liwa for the purpose of con certing measures for dealing promptly with further raids.1 18 T urkey. The Treaty of Angora. 95. In January His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom proposed, in accordance with article 8 of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930, to transfer to the Iraqi Government the rights and obligations of His Majesty’s Government under the Treaty of Angora of the 5th June, 1926, so as to leave that treaty one solely - between the King of Iraq and the President of the Turkish Republic. The Iraqi Government concurred in the terms of a British draft tripartite treaty in this sense. No progress was made in the matter, however, as the Turkish Government declined to accept the proposals. Commercial Treaty. 96. The Iraqi-Turkish Commercial Treaty signed on the 10th January, 1932, remained unratified throughout the year, the Turkish Government having given no confirmation of their intention to ratify. Frontier Relations. 97. At the end of 1932 the Turkish Kaimakam of the Shernakh Qadha and the Iraqi Kaimakam of Zakho met to concert measures for the capture of the brigand Haji Farkho. Co-operation to this end was arranged. At this meeting the Turks indicated that it was the intention of the Turkish Government to create a number of purely Turkish villages in the Eastern Kurdish districts. Barzan. 98. The Turkish Government had refused to hand over those Barzan rebels of 1932 who had taken refuge in Turkey, on the ground that they were political offenders and that the Extradition Treaty of the 10th January, 1932, did not apply. The Iraqi Government pointed out that the Barzan operations of 1932 had been undertaken at the instance of the Turkish Government, and in February the latter intimated their willingness to take action against the rebels. They had, however, neglected to keep them under proper control, with the result that minor operations had to be undertaken against them in the spring. The eventual capitulation of Mulla Mustapha and Muhammad Sadiq was hastened by the appearance of a body of Turkish troops in the neighbourhood in April. The Assyrians. 99. In August the Turkish Minister at Bagdad requested the Iraqi Govern ment, on instructions from his Government, to remove from the frontier the mischievous Assyrian race,” who were fomenting disorder. He invoked the I reaty of Angora in this connexion, and made it clear that his representations were n^de m the interests of good neighbourly relations. The Iraqi Government replied that the whole matter was in the hands of the League of Nations. Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. 100. In December 1932 the Soviet Government refused to agree to the pro ec ion by His Majesty s diplomatic and consular representatives of the interests of Iraqi subjects within the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. This depart l ire on i h ® lr P art ’ and ^ appeared that this policy was reiterated nffinfal rL^l lnatl0n i of the man ! late with the object of eventually obtaining H 10n . and re P resentatl °i&gt; Iraq. The Iraqi Government, however, mWii wslT, 6 rec °Sf se the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the question was not pursued further.

Parliament. The General Election. 102. The beginning of the year found Parliament dissolved and a general election in progress. Jafar Chalabiabu Timmun, the general secretary of the Nationalist party, endeavoured to organise a boycott of the elections on the ground that they were not being conducted in a proper atmosphere of political freedom, but the affiliated Party of National Brotherhood, led by Yasin Pasha, gave no support to this movement and it was a complete failure. 103. The final polling took place on the 8th February. The candidates nominated by the Government with the approval of the King were everywhere successful. Thirty-two of the Deputies of the previous Chamber were re-elected, but apart from the Prime Minister, Naji Beg Shaukat, only one of Nuri Pasha’s Cabinet, Jamal Baban, was returned. On the other hand, Yasin Pasha and a number of his adherents including Ali Jaudat, Jamil Madfai, Muhammad Zaki and three members of the Executive Committee of the Nationalist party all obtained seats. The result was the return of a Chamber fairly representative of most shades of political opinion, but by no means pledged to support the Cabinet formed by Naji Beg Shaukat in the preceding November. It was designed rather to enable the King to arrange for the formation of a Coalition Cabinet of all talents, an objective which he had had in mind since his quarrel with Nuri Pasha in October 1932. Opening of Parliament. 104. The King opened Parliament on the 8th March. In the Speech from the Throne he spoke of the pleasure with which he had received an invitation from King George to visit His Majesty during the summer, and expressed satis faction with his relations with his neighbours and with all other foreign States. 105. Referring to the work of the current session, he anticipated that it would include amendments to the Capital Works Law of 1931, and measures for strengthening the army and improving education and justice. The Resignation of the Cabinet. 106. A few days after the opening of the session, the Prime Minister, Naji Beg Shaukat, and his colleagues resigned under pressure from the King, and on the 20th March Royal Iradahs were issued appointing the following Cabinet:— Prime Minister : Rashid Ali-al-Gilani. Minister for Finance : Yasin-al-Hashimi. Minister for Foreign Affairs : Nuri-al-Said. Minister for the Interior : Hikmet Sulaiman. Minister for Economics and Communications : Rustam Haidar. Minister for Defence : Jallal Baban. Minister for Justice : Muhammad Zaki. Minister for Education : Muhammad Mahdi. 107. In bringing about the formation of this Cabinet, the King hoped to fulfil his desire for a coalition Government, which would put an end to party differences and unite all factions in the task of developing the resources of the country. It contained a preponderant Nationalist element, but His Majesty gave Sir Francis Humphrys the most emphatic assurances that the Iraqi Government, under Rashid Ali’s leadership, would continue to maintain the closest and most friendly relations with Great Britain. 108. On the 27th March the new Cabinet presented their programme to the Chamber. In this they declared their intention to respect international engagements, and to endeavour to realise national aspirations, to give Iraqis more executive responsibility in the Administration, and to introduce a National Service Law. Some of the Deputies questioned the Ministers regarding the demands which, while in Opposition, they had often made for the amendment20 of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance of 1930. The Ministers evaded direct i replies, and took refuge in the repetition of the Cabinet’s declared intention to work for the realisation of national aspirations, leaving it to the Chamber to guess what was implied by this cryptic statement. 109. The progress of the session was normal, with the budget as its central feature. Two important Bills passed were the Administrative Inspectorate Law and the Customs Tariff Law. The former provides that in future no foreigners shall be appointed as Administrative Inspectors; it also stipulates that the headquarters of all Administrative Inspectors shall be in Bagdad. The latter was the result of the recommendation made by two foreign customs experts who had been engaged by the Iraqi Government to revise the tariffs. The scope and effects of this law are discussed elsewhere in this report under the appropriate heading. 110. Parliament was prorogued on the 6th July after the statutory four months’ session. The Recess. 111. Shortly before the prorogation of Parliament, King Faisal, accompanied by the Ministers for Finance, Defence, and Economics and Communications, left Iraq for Europe, His Majesty to pay a State visit to His Majesty King George, and the Ministers for Finance and Economics and Communications to attend the World Economic Conference in London. Hope was entertained that the parliamentary recess would pass uneventfully, and that nothing would occur to disturb the smooth working of administrative routine during the trying heat of the summer. This hope was not fulfilled, and before Parliament met again the north had been the scene of a treacherous attack by the Mar bhimun party of the Assyrians on the Iraqi army, followed by ruthless and barbarous military reprisals, and King Faisal had died. For the purpose of reference, it is more convenient, however, to leave details of these events for later paragraphs, and to continue here the history of the activities of Parliament and of the changes of Government up to the end of the year. The Cabinet again Resigns. n A S k®gi ni n n g of a new session approached, Rashid Ali and his ru. ea ? ues )e |&gt; an ^ ear ^ at the 7 would no longer be given the confidence of the Chamber The Prime Minister asked the King (now King Ghazi, who had succeeded his father on the 8th September) to dissolve Parliament, hoping in an election, according to custom, to secure the election of a strong bloc of Deputies S'; ir su RP ort , his Cabinet. _ The King refused on the 29th October and | i- , 1 •’esigne .

After the ceremony of the opening and the election of officers for the session, the meetings of both Houses of Parliament were suspended pending the formation of a new Cabinet. Jamil Madfai and his colleagues faced the Chamber for the first time on • the 12th November, and the Deputies indicated their confidence by electing, almost unanimously, the Government’s nominee for the presidential chair. The Prime Minister made a speech which was understood to be intended to be an expose of policy. It was, however, the vaguest and most ambiguous mixture of platitudes and pious hopes, and shed no light on the principles which the Cabinet intended to follow in governing and administering the country. 114. At the same meeting the Government presented a draft National Service Law, which was received with acclamation and passed to the appropriate standing committee for report. The meeting was then closed by the reading of a Royal Iradah proroguing Parliament for thirty days. 115. The Chamber reassembled on the 13th December, and five meetings were held before the close of the year. The Ramadan fast, however, began on the 18th December, and in consequence little activity was shown in the Chamber. One noteworthy debate occurred on the 21st December when, during a discussion of a supplementary vote of 10,000 Iraqi dinars for missions and deputations, the Government were questioned on the work of the Iraqi delegation to London in the summer (see paragraph 209). A number of Deputies asked for information about the results achieved by the delegation, and expressed doubts whether the country had had full value for the money which had been spent on it. Yasin Pasha, as the head of the delegation, made a statement in which he gave details of his loan negotiations with finanial houses in London, and the part played by the delegation at the Economic Conference. In the end the vote was adopted, but not before Yasin Pasha had been given a good taste of the sort of unsympathetic treatment which he has so often given to others in the past. The A ssyrians. 116. In the annual report for 1932, the story of the Assyrians was closed with the resolution adopted by the Council of the League of Nations on the 15th December, rejecting the demand of the Assyrians for administrative autonomy in Iraq and approving the Iraqi Government’s scheme for finding land for the small balance of the community which was still unsettled. Hope was entertained that this resolution, if followed by an honest endeavour to give effect to the settlement scheme approved by the Council, would lead to a final solution of the Assyrian problem. The events of the year completely destroyed this hope. 117. From the outset, the decision of the Council of the League was unpalatable to Mar Shimun, the Assyrian Patriarch, and from the moment of his return to Mosul from Geneva in January 1933 he set out to put every possible difficulty in the way of the success of the Iraqi Government’s settlement scheme. The Mosul authorities made efforts in February to induce Mar Shimun to co-operate with the local settlement committee which had been set up, but their efforts met with flat refusals. Mar Shimun remained obdurate and continued his campaign of obstruction; even threatening with excommunication those who should avail themselves of the Government’s settlement offers. He also encouraged the belief that the new lands suggested for settlement were unhealthy, and fostered unrest by encouraging loose talk of emigration to Persia or Syria, a course of action which he well knew to be impracticable. Other Assyrian leaders were, however, less intractable, and Malik Khoshaba, of the Lower Tiari tribe, agreed to co-operate with the local committee in organising a new settlement in the Dashtazai area on the Greater Zab River. This arrangement was greatly resented by Mar Shimun, who desired all relations between the Government and the Assyrian chieftains and people to be conducted through himself. In May the Iraqi Government appointed Major D. Thomson to take charge of the settlement work, and in view of his imminent arrival in Iraq, summoned Mar Shimun to Bagdad. There the Minister of the Interior explained the Government’s view of the situation, and made a final effort to persuade the Patriarch to abandon his organised opposition to the settlement scheme which had22 been approved by the Council of the League. He also emphasised in a letter that, while the Iraqi Government could not delegate any temporal authority to the Patriarch’s office, they were prepared to enact a Community Law on the lines of those already in force in regard to other religious minorities, and to recognise Mar Shimun as the spiritual head of the Nestorian Church in Iraq. At the same time, the Minister asked for a written undertaking from Mar Shimun that he Jk would accept the position and would do nothing to obstruct the new settlement * scheme. He refused either to commit himself or to give any assistance or information to the settlement expert, Major D. Thomson, who interviewed him in Bagdad early in June. Nevertheless, negotiations were continued with Mar Shimun, and both His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires in Bagdad and the adviser to the Ministry of the Interior gave their good offices with a view to establish a working understanding between him and the Iraqi Government. In the meantime, about the 14th June, an Assyrian chieftain of the Upper Tiari tribe, Yaku, son of Malik Ismail, collected an armed band of some 200 men in the Dohuk qadha and defied the local authorities. On the 24th June the situation became so threatening that the Iraqi Government decided to send a military force to the area to prevent the spread of disorder and a clash between Yaku’s band and the local Kurds, who were becoming restless. In the end the British Administrative Inspector, under orders from the Ministry of the Interior, made a final and successful effort to induce Yaku to submit, and on giving an under taking to keep the peace in the future, he was pardoned and allowed to return to his home. The Iraqi Government now, however, judged it inadvisable to allow Mar Shimun to return to Mosul, and he was so informed in writing on the 24th June. His Majesty’s Government considered this step most injudicious, and Sir Francis Humphrys, who was at that time in England with King Faisal, persuaded His Majesty to telegraph his disapproval to the Government in Bagdad! The Government, however, stuck to their guns and threatened to resign if over ruled. The question was still unsolved when fresh developments forced attention to more serious issues. 118. About the 23rd July two Assyrian leaders, Yaku of the Upper Tiari and Loko of the Tkhuma, with about 1,200 armed men, crossed the frontier into Syrian territory near Faishkhabur on the Tigris. The wives and children of these men weie left behind in their villages. Other parties of armed Assyrians also began to move from their villages to join those already in Syria. In' order to minimise the possibilities of a clash, a few of these parties were allowed to cross the bolder, but on the 27th July, in consequence of objections made by the French authorities in Syria, further crossings were forbidden. The possibility of this large body returning to Iraq with subversive intentions caused the Government considerable anxiety, and military forces were sent to the vicinity 0 aish Khabui with orders not to allow Yaku’s followers to recross the TUris un ess they surrendered their arms. At the same time urgent representations weie made to the French Legation in Bagdad requesting the immediate disarming and withdrawal of the dissident Assyrians from the vicinity of the frontier. Meanwhile, at the urgent instance of His Majesty’s Government, King Faisal accompanied by Nuri Pasha, was hurriedly returning from flTonH A nd t0 . Ba S, d a d to take charge of the situation. His Majesty arrived on the 2nd August and found that the tension had been much relieved by the action h!n m re tt,?‘tTt h T I1 i tleS VJ Syri V n dl 1 sa y mln g nearly all the Assyrians of Yaku’s 1 et ween thp JU y ' 1 j 'Tf T° Ped ^ by tMs Ste P the da ng er of a battle between the Assyrians and the Iraqi troops had been averted Dismay was therefore the greater when news reached Bnorlarl iVioi v i u ‘ • back by the French frontier o^fhe evenmgtf thTlthlumist^'InS atUcl he w4 SS noi a ren V r e i hea V-i y attacl j ln ,g the Ira qi camp at Dairabifn.

The remainder of their following broke up into small parties and were pursued during the next few days by pofe[10072] b 12 military, and hastily armed tribal irregulars. Meanwhile, the discovery that the Assyrians had mutilated and burned the bodies of an Iraqi officer and some soldiers captured by them in the fighting at Dairabun had aroused a frenzy of religious feeling, and detachments of the Iraqi army, prompted by fear and revenge, had recourse to massacre. The worst atrocity was the cold-blooded and brutal slaughter of over 300 unarmed Assyrians in Simel village. Simultaneously there was a general looting of Assyrian villages by neighbouring Mahometan and Yezidi tribesmen. All but four of the total of fifty-six Assyrian villages in the Dohuk and Sheikhan qadhas were wholly or partially destroyed, but the tribesmen were far less ruthless than the army in taking life, and the number of Assyrians killed by them was comparatively small. Thanks to the firm hand of the kaimakam, a Kurd, the Assyrians in the Amadiyah qadha remained practically unmolested. In all it is estimated that about 600 Assyrian men and a few women lost their lives in these disturbances. Gradually the fury subsided. On the 12th August a proclamation was broadcast calling on the Assyrians still under arms to surrender within sixty hours and promising pardon to those who did so. On the 18th August the Mutessarif of Mosul proclaimed the operations against the Assyrians at an end, and threatened with severe punishment anyone molesting them or their property. Towards the end of the month the troops concentrated in the north were withdrawn, and the local civil officials set about the task of restoring normality. Under pressure from His Majesty’s Embassy, Major Thomson, the settlement expert, was provided with funds and entrusted with the tasks of organising in Mosul a camp for the women and children left destitute through the death of their menfolk, and of reconstructing the villages which had been destroyed. Arrangements were also made to assist the Royal Air Force in evacuating to Hinaidi the homeless families of men serving in the levies. 120. The bitter feelings aroused by the fighting caused the position of Mar Shimun in Bagdad (and of his father and brother, who had joined him there) to become exceedingly dangerous. The Iraqi Government were threatening either to remove them to captivity in some remote place or to try them on a capital charge. Finally, through 'the efforts of His Majesty’s Embassy, it was arranged that they should be deported, and His Majesty’s Government offered to transport them to a temporary asylum in Cyprus. 121. Mar Shimun, his father and brother, were flown to Cyprus on the 18th August in Royal Air Force aircraft, and his aunt, Surma, with a number of women and children, followed to the same destination on the 29th August. 122. Repercussions of these events soon spread beyond Iraq. On the 6th August the Iraqi Government telegraphed a protest to the League of Nations against the action of the French mandatory authorities in rearming the men of Yaku’s band and permitting them to return to Iraq; and, on the 17th August, Mar Shimun telegraphed to the League appealing for intervention to save his people from massacre. Wide publicity was also given in the press throughout the world to the situation of the Assyrians in Iraq. On the 31st August the Minorities Committee of the Council (the Committee of Three) decided to bring the matter before the Council. 123. Meanwhile, His Majesty’s Ambassador, having been recalled from leave, had arrived in Bagdad on the 23rd August. He urged the Iraqi Government to stamp out the sporadic looting of Assyrian villages by tribesmen, which still continued, and to do everything possible to restore order and confidence, to reconstruct the devastated villages, and to relieve the distress of the families left destitute. He also persuaded King Faisal to remain in Bagdad until the 1st September, to inaugurate measures of relief and the withdrawal of troops to their peace stations. For the exiled Mar Shimun he obtained a provisional allowance of £65 a month, subject to his correct behaviour, until the future of the Assyrians should be settled by the League. 124. As regards the policy to be adopted by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom when the Assyrian question came up before the Council of the League, His Majesty’s Ambassador expressed the opinion that if foreign intervention in the form of a League enquiry on the spot were imposed on Iraq, an extreme Nationalist Government would come into power, supported by an24 outburst of anti-Christian and anti-foreign feeling, which would endanger all Christians in the country. He urged that the apportionment of blame was a barren proceeding, and advocated that a solution^ of the problem should be sought through the co-operation of His Majesty’s Government with the League of Nations in resettling the Assyrians outside Iraq, the Iraqi Government being pressed to contribute liberally to the cost of this operation. 125. King Faisal died at Berne on the 8th September, and the Iraqi Government asked for a short postponement of the hearing of the Assyrian question on account of this event. To this the Council agreed. The Iraqi delegation, consisting of Yasin Pasha and Nuri Pasha, eventually arrived in Geneva on the 25th September, and set about the task of documenting their case and of furnishing the Council with observations on the voluminous petitions submitted by Mar Shimun, who arrived in Geneva shortly after the Iraqi delegation. 126. The Assyrian question was ultimately placed on the Council agenda on the 14th October. The discussion was opened by Yasin Pasha, who made a long statement on behalf of the Iraqi Government. While admitting that deplorable excesses had occurred, he claimed that the Iraqi Government had made a sincere effort to implement the Council’s resolution of December 1932, and emphasised that these efforts had been frustrated by the active opposition of the Patriarch and his particular following, which had culminated in an armed rebellion. The Iraqi Government had, he said, reached the conclusion that, in the interests of all concerned, a new home outside Iraq must be found for those Assyrians who were unwilling to settle down peaceably in Iraq. The Iraqi Government were prepared to make as generous a contribution as their resources permitted towards the resettlement of the Assyrians in this manner, but they were obliged to appeal to the League to find the land which would be required for this purpose. The rapporteur (Sr. Madariaga, the representative of Spain), then presented his report. After reviewing the events which had led up to the renewed consideration by the Council of the situation of the Assyrians in Iraq, and deploring the excesses which had occurred, he emphasised the barrenness of a mere assessment of responsibility for what had occurred, and advocated an effort to evolve a constructive solution. He proposed that the Council should set up a committee of six of their members with wide powers to consider the practicability of resettling the Assyrians outside Iraq, and if this were possible to proceed to the execution of this solution of the problem in close collaboration with the Iraqi Government. He suggested that this committee should report piogiess to the Council in January, and that they should also, through the lepoits of the Iraqi Government, keep themselves informed regarding the measmes adopted by the Iraqi Government to fulfil the Council’s resolution of ecembei 1932 m the case of those Assyrians who might wish to remain in Iraq. Un benait of His Majesty s Government in the United Kingdom, the Secretarv ot btate condemned the excesses which had been committed in dealing with the Assyrians, and welcomed the constructive proposals put forward hy the rapporteur Sr. Madariaga’s report was then unanimously adopted and a committee of six, consisting of the representatives of Spain, the United Kingdom, Iiance, Italy, Denmark and Mexico, was accordingly constituted. • 12 7hn A ? ei ® xc ^ an S e several notes the Iraqi Government’s charges against the French Government in respect of the rearming of Yaku and his the 0 CouncU eie ro ^ ) ^ )e&lt; ^ ^7 mutual consent, and the matter was not brought before izo.

In endeavouring to find a suitable place for the resettlement of those[10072] b 13 25 Assyrians who might wish to leave, the Council Committee encountered great difficulty. Scarcely any of the suitable countries approached welcomed the idea of mass Assyrian^ immigration into their territory, and only the scheme put forward by the Nansen Office for the settlement of these people in Brazil on the land of the Parana Estates Company seemed to offer any prospect of success. Up to the close of the year, however, the Brazilian Government had not given their consent to this scheme, and according to private information received by the Council Committee, they were not favourably disposed towards it. 130. In Iraq the local committee had carried out the first of the tasks assigned to them under the resolution of the Council Committee referred to above, and had also done their best to persuade all the Assyrians to continue their normal lives and to sow crops for next year, pointing out to them that even in the most favourable circumstances it was not likely that any large number of them could be transported elsewhere before the middle of the summer. The camp for destitutes was also maintained, providing food, shelter and clothing for about 1,500 women, children and old men. 131. The attitude of the Assyrians themselves remains largely incalculable. At the end of the year Mar Shimun was in London enjoying the solicitude of friends and awaiting the result of the efforts of the Geneva Committee to find a new home for his followers. In Iraq, while most of the Assyrians seemed anxious to quit the country, the idea of a transfer to such a distant and unknown country as Brazil not unnaturally alarmed them. A considerable section, moreover, mostly men who had given little or no support to the Patriarch’s struggle with the Government, declared emphatically that although, after what had happened, they would be glad to leave Iraq, they would on no account go to the same country as Mar Shimun. The Iraqi Government had not finally committed themselves in regard to the sum of money which they would contribute to the cost of resettle ment, and they were disposed to take the view that the amount could not be decided until a suitable place had been found and the number of Assyrians who wished to leave ascertained. It was known, however, that their ideas centred on a figure which would be quite inadequate to finance the Parana Plantations scheme, which, it was estimated, would cost about £314,000 for 10,000 souls. 132. In these circumstances the year closed with no assured prospect of a final solution of the Assyrian problem. The Kurds. Barzan. 133. The aftermath of the Barzan trouble has been successfully cleared up. At the beginning of the year Sheikh Ahmad was confined somewhere in Turkey, but his two fighting brothers, Muhammad Sadiq and Mulla Mustafa were at large on the border. The Iraqi Government made representations to the Turkish Government requesting them to co-operate in dealing with the situation, and Turkish troops arrived on the frontier early in April. About a month later, the insurgents having crossed into Iraq, were engaged by the police, who suffered some casualties. Further representations were then made in Angora for more energetic action by the Turkish troops to deny refuge to the Barzanis in Turkish territory. At the same time the Iraqi Government wisely declared an amnesty to the Barzan leaders, though reserving the right to fix their place of residence if they thought fit. After some further light skirmishing and political manoeuvring, Muhammad Sadiq and Mulla Mustafa both made formal submission in June. In July, Sheikh Ahmad, with his own consent, was handed over by the Turks to the Iraqi Government. After a few weeks honourable and comfortable detention in Bagdad, he was permitted to return to reside in Mosul, where he can live at ease on the revenues of his properties. 134. Since then Barzan has remained quiet, though it may be doubted whether the control of the local authorities is very effective beyond rifle range of the police posts which have been established in the area.26 The Pizhder. 135. The Pizhder are the one remaining Kurdish tribe enjoying complete local autonomy. Their country lies close to the Persian border north and south of the Lesser Zab River. Administrative control over this was lost in 1922, when Suleimani was evacuated, and has never been restored. In October representative chiefs from the tribe came to Bagdad and declared their loyalty to the Govern ment. They were kindly received and returned home well pleased with their visit General. 136. The Kurds of the less tribal and more politically-minded districts, such as Arbil and Suleimani, have remained quiet, and there has been no visible nationalist agitation. Individual enthusiasts continue, however, to bewail the dominance of Arab officials and the increasing use of the Arab language in the Kurdish districts. The Yazidis. 137. The internal unrest among the Yazidis arising from their dissatis faction with their chief or Mir, Said Beg, which was described in the previous annual report, has apparently diminished. The Sin jar Peacock was restored to the Mir in September, and in October Hamu Sharu, the chieftain most opposed to Said Beg, died. He was succeeded by his son, Khudaidah, a less obstinate man with a better knowledge of modern conditions. Under the influence of these events the Yazidis appear to have been sobered, and much less has been heard of their internecine quarrels. Arab Congress. 13 ®- , Tlle Ara* 5 Congress so much talked of in 1932 remains unrealised. Ii the early days of the year King Faisal was apparently working to arrange fo the congress to be held in Bagdad in the spring. He was, however, steadih discouraged by His Majesty s Ambassador, and was constantly embarrassed b ; the dissensions of the principal protagonists of the congress': Groups repre sentmg the Hashimite, Saudi and Syrian Nationalist interests were unable subordinate particular to common interests, and the conflict of counsel am P-rV- mcreas ed by the passing appearance of the ex-Khedive Abbas Hilm m l il irn! e o P f n abla , n ^ ta ? e - 1 , Irl , March the Kin g announced postponemen, until the autumn and Yasin Pasha, who had been His Majesty’s principa OrpnnTsW Pn* Arab leaders in Jerusalem and Damascus, resigned from th&lt; this milter wit Y e&lt; ” i' t l 'i con g re ss.

These casures put an end to the threat of disorder, but the incident had the effect of[10072] B 14 27 IS 3 * reviving Shiah political agitation, and for a time there was much talk in the Euphrates districts of the formation of a Shiah party to safeguard sectarian interests and to secure for the Shiahs a greater share in the government and administration of the country. This revival, however, met with no encouragement from the leading ulema (Shiah divines), and interest in sectarian agitation was soon afterwards lost in the excitement of the Assyrian troubles in the north. The Government, too, were quick to take advantage of the opportunity which these troubles offered to strengthen their appeal for a united Islam to save the country from disruption. By the time order had been restored in Mosul, Abdul Razzaq and his book had been forgotten, and the age-old enmity between the two great Islamic sects had once again relapsed into an uneasy sleep. The Press. 140. Journalists in Iraq live almost exclusively by purveying political criticism to the literate public. They have learned from experience that circulation varies in direct ratio with the violence of their comments on current affairs, and have not yet discovered the sales value of the magazine feature. As it is often dangerous to incur the wrath of powerful neighbours with whom they | have to live in daily contact, the favourite target for their slings and arrows is | the British and all that they do in Iraq. The editors can then pose as patriots if I successful, and martyrs if suppressed. Moreover, there is always a small public I to whom clarion calls to awake and smite the oppressor are the symphonic accompaniment of day dreams of what they would do if they only knew how and dared. The sensible man in the street, who represents the saner outlook and practical indifference to emotional thought of the vast mass of the population, would probably not waste his ha’pence on a newspaper, whatever it published. 141. Actually, the press in Iraq, in spite of its malicious inspiration, does very little harm, and the Government has seldom failed to intervene and suppress any newspaper which ventured too far along the road of slander and calumny in pursuit of sales. Often such essays are only thinly-disguised blackmail, and there are many diligent civil servants who won their posts through yellow journalism. ( 142. All Governments in Iraq do lip service to the ideal of a free, unfettered press, but they are always careful to secure a very tight hold over the “fourth estate” of the realm. Rashid Ali’s Cabinet was no exception. Although, in Opposition, he and several of his colleagues had championed the freedom of the press, in office they retained the same close control over it as their predecessors had done. For the sake of window-dressing, the “ oppressive ” Press Law of 1931 was repealed, but the new law which took its place in August 1933 reserved for the Government powers just as arbitrary and effective as those which had been exercised under the old law. These powers, moreover, have frequently been used, and the temporary suspension of a newspaper occurs too often to evoke much comment or surprise. 143. The press, of course, has played its role of resounding echo to popular sentiment on the events of the year. The bubble of frothy passion blown up by contending interpreters of Arab history in the summer (see paragraph 139) burst with bomb-like explosion in the newspapers, and the shame and meanness of the dispute were cloaked with much hurried scribbling of mixed metaphors about “ The foreign hand behind the scenes fishing in troubled waters to put a spoke in the wheel of Islamic unity.” The Assyrian “ revolt ” later on provided a splendid subject for impassioned journalism, and dark allusions to a plot by the British colonisers to enslave the country with Christian mercenaries were the favourite ornament of the “leaders” of the day. There was more than a suspicion that the Government were intentionally riding the press on a loose rein, and His Majesty’s Chargd d’Affaires had to call on the Prime Minister to apply the curb (see paragraph 17). In the autumn the boycott of the Bagdad Electric Light Company received full support from the press, which, with customary hyperbole, represented this iniquitous ramp of a handful of Jews, coffee-shop keepers, racketeers and young corner boys as a national struggle against economic enslavement to the foreigner. The Government did not, however, permit the campaign to continue for long, and several of the worst offenders were J soon suspended.28 144. Reviewing the year as a whole, it may be said that the attitude of the Bagdad press towards British interests in Iraq is no worse than in the past. In fact, it is somewhat better. The improvement comes not from any change of heart, but from the fact that as British guidance diminishes and Iraqis themselves assume greater direct responsibility and consolidate their political groups, it becomes more difficult to find fault with His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and easier and more attractive to attack one or other of the leading personalities. This was particularly noticeable towards the end of the year, when Yasin Pasha and Nuri Pasha were actively engaged in trying to destroy each other’s public reputation through the newspapers which each controls. King Ali. 145. King Ali, elder brother of King Faisal, flew from Bagdad to Amman in an Iraqi aeroplane on the 24th May. From Amman His Majesty proceeded later in the summer to Switzerland, and was at Berne at the time of King Faisal’s death. He returned to Bagdad with the late King’s body early in September but left again for Switzerland on the 22nd September to complete a course of treatment which he was undergoing there. From Berne he later proceeded via Geneva to Paris in company with the Amir Shakib Arslan. After a stay of about ten days, he returned to Bagdad in mid-November. While he was in Paris he took pains to deny any official business, hut it was well known in Bagdad that he hoped for an opportunity to put out feelers in the Quai d’Orsay concerning his candidature for the Syrian throne. Even the young King Ghazi was impressed by the foolishness of his uncle’s proceedings, and did his best to dissuade him from his Paris adventure. So far as is known, the visit was entirely barren of result, and since his return to Bagdad King Ali seems to have settled down once more to a quiet life of retirement in his villa on the Tigris. Justice. Affointment of Judges (see paragraphs 210 and 211 of the report for 1932). 146. As the Iraqi Government showed no disposition to proceed with the appointments under the Judicial Agreement of 1931 of Messrs. Good, O’Meara and Campbell, His Majesty s Ambassador made strong representations on this subject in April and May, pointing out that, so long as the courts at Baqubah and Hilla remained without British presidents, a case could be made out against Iraq, which would not be resisted by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, that the guarantees given to the League of Nations in 1932 had not been implemented. Ihe Iraqi Government, however, maintained a non-possumus attitude, and the problem was only temporarily solved during the summer, when the vacancies caused by the absence on leave of the British presidents of the Courts of Appeal and Sessions in Bagdad were filled by two of the unemployed a u eS ‘ , l re f ure was therefore renewed on the return of His Majesty’s m assadoi from leave, but owing to the Assyrian crisis and the death of mg raisal, it was not until the end of the year that the Iraqi Government gave way an appointed Messrs. Good and O’Meara as presidents of the Courts of essions at Baqubah and Hilla respectively. Mr. Campbell remained employed in the Ministry of Justice.

The matter was discussed the publiLiof oUL kw which 6 cameTnTfor 11 P ? tP °On examining the actual text of the law, however, H.s MajeUy s® Govertmlnt in the29 United Kingdom reached the conclusion that continental judges would probably take a more lenient view of it than would British judges, and that it was unlikely that either the League or the Permanent Court of International Justice would hold that what had been done was inconsistent with Iraq’s undertakings. His Majesty’s Embassy, nevertheless, made it clear to the Iraqi Government that the change was one for the worse, and that if some member of the League considered that it did, in fact, constitute an infringement of article 12 of the Declaration of Guarantees, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would feel unable to support the Iraqi Government. Penal Code. 148. Changes in the Penal Code were under consideration during the year designed to afford measures for the special protection of diplomatic missions in Iraq and to deal with offences against the British forces in this country. The suggested changes were deemed by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to be inadequate. Education. 149. With the departure of Mr. Somerville early in the year the direct British connexion with Iraqi educational policy disappeared. The late King Faisal was dissatisfied with the present state of education in Iraq on the ground that the instruction given in the secondary schools was parochial and not calculated to broaden outlook. Though no actual progress was made with regard to the proposal to establish an institution on English public school lines near Bagdad, the scheme was not lost sight of, and towards the end of the year there was a desire on the part of the Government to have concrete proposals put forward by a competent British expert. Instructions were issued in the autumn to local educational authorities to increase the time allotted to the study of English, but it is clear that a more positive policy will be necessary if English educational ideals are to hold their own against those originating in France and America. The importance attached by the Iraqi Government to education is reflected in the increased sums allotted for that purpose in the budget (see paragraph 159). The number of entrants for the London Matriculation Examination held in Bagdad showed no diminution during the year, but a request by the educational authorities that the actual conduct and invigilation of the examination should be in the hands of Iraqis had to be resisted. 150. An unobtrusive, but none the less effective, work was set on foot under the auspices of the Iraqi Red Crescent Society. At the suggestion and under the guidance of Lady Humphrys, two British nurses were appointed to Bagdad in the autumn, and now conduct regular courses in the rudiments of public hygiene and infant welfare. 151. There were some complaints during the year concerning the alleged appointment of Mahometan teachers in Government schools where hitherto only Christian teachers had been employed. These complaints were brought by His Majesty’s Embassy to the notice of the competent authorities, who issued urgent instructions to the effect that Christian communities were to receive the most sympathetic consideration in this matter. Upon investigation it appeared that the complaints had been exaggerated. Distinguished Visitors. 152. The Most Honourable the Marquess of Londonderry, Secretary of State for Air, arrived in Bagdad by a Royal Air Force machine from Amman on the 19th January and left for England by Imperial Airways on the 27th January. During his stay Lord Londonderry was the guest of His Majesty’s Ambassador. His programme included an inspection of the Royal Air Force squadrons at Hinaidi, Mosul, Shaiba and Basra, and a flight over the country of the Barzan operations of 1932. 153. The Right Honourable Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, Secretary of State for the Colonies, visited Iraq privately from Palestine in April. He arrived in Bagdad from Palestine by Imperial Airways on the 23rd April. Two days later [10072] B 1530 he flew to Mosul in a Royal Air Force aircraft, and on the 26th April he returned by air to Palestine. During his stay in Bagdad he was the guest of Hi' Majesty’s Ambassador. 154. In January the ex-Khedive Abbas Hilmi spent a week in Bagdad as the guest of King Faisal. He arrived by the overland route in an immense luxury bus, which he had had specially constructed for the journey, and left bv rail by the Taurus Express route for Paris. Rumour was rife at the time as to the object of his visit. He was freely credited with aspirations to the throne of both Syria and Palestine, and it was even suggested that he was a candidate for the Caliphate. Whatever private plans he may have had, he did nothin? ostensible during his visit to confirm these rumours, and his pleasant manners won the good opinion of all with whom he came into social contact. He dined at the Embassy and showed every desire to please. 155. Saiyid Muhammad Amin-al-Hussaini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem stayed for several days in Bagdad early in May while en route to India to collect funds for the proposed Islamic University in Jerusalem. He was received bv King Faisal and entertained by the Cabinet and local Islamic societies. He also lunched at His Majesty’s Embassy. At the semi-public entertainments which he attended, Iraqi speakers naturally referred to the “ sufferings ” of the Arabs in Palestine under the mandatory regime, but the Grand Mufti in his replies dwelt on the importance of education and culture as a means to regeneration rather than on the political aspects of the position of the Arabs. On his return iournev m November the Grand Mufti again passed through Bagdad, and save Sl j^ ra ? C1S Humphrys an interesting account of his visit to Persia, Afghanistan and India. He also expressed his sorrow at the disturbances which had occurred m Palestine during his absence, and said that on his return to Jerusalem he channels 86 ^ mflueilCe t0 direct the Arab mov ement into more constitutional IV.

For reasons described elsewhere, even this high percentage proved to be insufficient. The Government were encouraged to budget for an increase in the revenue from agricultural and natural produce by an improvement in the climatic and economic conditions affecting agriculture, and an anticipated improvement in the administration of the new istihlak system of collecting the taxes on agricultural produce. A substantial increase was also allowed for in the receipts from customs and excise as a result of the improvement in trade, signs of which were then clearly visible. Parliament itself considered that the Minister was insufficiently optimistic in his estimate of the extent of the improvement, and increased the estimated figure of receipts by another £66,000. This revision was made by way of compensation to counterbalance the fall in revenue which was expected to follow reductions which had been authorised in the rates of export duty and liquor excise, the former being practically abolished, and the latter substantially diminished in order to enable the products of local distillation to compete with the cheaper and more popular brands of smuggled liquor. 160. The advance royalties and dead rent payments due from the Iraq Petroleum Company were again omitted from the revenue estimates in accordance with the policy of segregating such revenues for development schemes and works of a capital nature, but the annual payment due during the year from the British Oil Development Company of £140,000, was taken into general revenues. Similar action was taken as a special emergency measure during the previous financial year to meet the cost of the Barzan operations, and its repetition as a matter of routine did not meet with general approval. The 5 per cent, cut in official salaries and pensions was maintained for the year. A few other alterations of no particular significance were made in the figures by the Chamber of Deputies and the estimates as finally passed were as follows :— Iraqi dinars. Revenue ... ... ... ... 3,765,000 Expenditure ... ... ... 3,764,906 Surplus ... ... ... 96 161. A balanced budget, omitting the special oil revenues, was, therefore, once more displayed. The criticism that the figures of anticipated revenue were lightheartedly and optimistically assessed is answered by the assertion, indubitably true, that there is always a substantial underspending of allotments which provides an annual hidden reserve to cover shortfalls in revenue. Supplementary Estimates for 1933-34. 162. The expenditure upon the special measures taken to deal with the Assyrian disturbances necessitated the passing of an ordinance allotting a further sum of 42,100 Iraqi dinars for army expenditure, additional police and relief measures. No other supplementary allotments were authorised up to the 31st December, 1933. Actual Receipts and Expenditure for 1932-33. 163. The estimates, as finally approved by the Iraqi Parliament for the financial year which ended on the 31st March, 1933, showed a surplus of £7,365, but a crop of supplementary allotments to meet additional and unforeseen expenditure necessitated the vote of further sums to a total of £260,000, of which only £120,000 was found by reappropriation within the sanctioned estimates. In order to provide the requisite funds, the Government decided, as a special measure, to appropriate, for general revenue purposes, the sum of £112,500 due to be paid by the British Oil Development Company as the first instalment of the payments under their concession, although it had originally been intended to segregate the receipts from this source, as well as those derived from the Iraq Petroleum Company for expenditure on the capital works programme. As is explained above, the special measure then adopted has now become a matter of routine. 164. Included in the supplementary allotments was the extraordinary expenditure consequent upon the military operations in the Barzan area, and the allotment of additional funds to meet the cost of tightening the civil admini strative control over the area brought under subjugation, such as the provision of new Government buildings, the recruitment of additional police and an expansion32 in the military and aerial forces. The other causes of increased expend itme were not such as to call for special comment. 165 The effect of these later adjustments upon the estimates of normal receipts'and expenditure for the year 1932-33, was^to convert the original anticipated surplus of £7,365 into a nominal deficit of £20,847. The accounts of the year when published, however, showed that the habit of undci spending, or over-estimating expenditure, already referred to was sufficient to wipe out the deficit and substitute therefor a surplus of £104,893. The actual, as compared with the modified estimates, were as follows Original Estimates. Revised Estimates. Actuals. Revenue Expenditure Surplus Deficit 3,578,808 3,571,443 7,365 3.691,308 3,712,155 20,847 3,691,052 3,586,159 104,893 166. The remarkably close relationship between the estimated receipts and actual receipts is to some extent fortuitous. The volume of imports was steadily maintained throughout the year, and the receipts from customs import duties were actually £105,046 in excess of the estimates. Most other sources of revenue produced less than had been anticipated, and the shoitfall fiom them was approximately equal to the customs surplus, ihe undei spending \\as spread ovei practically all departments, the Ministry of Defence failing to digest £33,000 of their extra allotment. 167.

As noted in last year’s report, the financial year 1931-32 represented the trough of the wave of the economic depression in Iraq, and the results of the financial year 1932-33 show the improvement in agriculture and commerce which was then foreshadowed. Income Tax. 170. The receipts from income tax show a steady increase and, now that the officials in charge of the administration of the tax are becoming more experienced, their net is being spread wider and the incidence of the tax is being felt by a larger proportion of the taxable population. No alteration was made in the basis of taxation during the year, which is :— First £150 of income free of tax. Next £150 of income is taxed at the rate of 6 per cent. Income in excess of £300 is taxed at the rate of 9 per cent. 171. A further amending law was, however, hastily passed by Parliament shortly before the close of the autumn session of 1933, which introduced a number of important changes into the machinery for the collection of tax, with retroactive effect to the 1 st April, 1933. A method of fixed assessment has been adopted for members of the professional and trading classes according to their income, which is to be assessed by committees appointed in large towns for the purpose. This method is probably better suited to Iraq than the more precise formalities based on British practice. A somewhat controversial measure was the introduction of a formula whereby the profit of shipping and aircraft companies entering the sea and air ports of Iraq is to be computed on the basis of 5 per cent, of the amounts receivable from traffic originating in Iraq. Such companies have been liable to pay tax on their profits since the original law was passed, but the Government had experienced considerable difficulty in attempting to assess the profits. The new rule of thumb measure has met with some opposition from the shipping companies concerned, and a combined representation to the Government on the subject was under contemplation at the end of the year. The normal abatement on the first £300 of income was withdrawn by law from the profits of companies and from residents abroad. In the latter category are included recipients of disability and dependants’ allowances granted in respect of British ex-officials resident in the United Kingdom. At the request of His Majesty’s Embassy, the collection of arrears of tax, which was ordered at Christmas time, was spread over a period, and the propriety of further representations on behalf of the recipients, on whom the impost bears somewhat hardly, was under consideration at the close of the year.34 Revision of the Method of Taxation of Produce {Istihlak Tax). 172. In 1931 the Iraqi Government, impressed by the necessity of assisting agriculture, and by the need for reform in the system of taxation of agricultural produce, passed a law which changed the entire method of land taxation. The law introduced a system whereby the assessment of revenue upon the products of ' the land available at harvest time was abolished, and taxation was to be levied upon that part of the produce which is taken to market or exported. This change relieved the cultivator of the necessity of paying tax upon the produce grown for his own consumption, and eliminates the complicated system of variable assessments, based upon area and land tenure. Rental is charged for occupied Government lands, and a water rate is levied upon land watered by flow irrigation 173. Considerable administrative difficulties have been incurred in applying the new system and, although the change has undoubtedly relieved the cultivator it has thrown a burden on the traders with which they are only inadequately equipped to deal. 174. Further, the collection of the land taxes by two sets of officials is uneconomic. 175. The tax itself is not free from vices of principle, since it acts as a tax on exports and is rather a deterrent than an incentive to improved cultivation. 176. The yield from the istihlak tax, as distinct from land rent and water rent, have not yet been shown separately in the Government accounts, but the financial results of the change have proved to be disappointing to the Treasury. A large number of officials are employed, and with the exception of the receipts from the date crop, which has never been a difficult form of revenue to collect, a large proportion of the revenue is swallowed up by the cost of collection. The gradual and successful extension of land settlement operations will afford a better basis for a fixed land assessment, and this method will probably be accepted as the ultimate solution of the problem of collecting the Government’s tithe on agricultural produce. Land Settlement. 177. Satisfactory progress was made during the year towards the goal of a uniform and scientific system of land tenure throughout Iraq, in pursuance of the policy inaugurated during the previous year. 178. The operations of the land settlement officers follow in general the iecommendations of Sir Ernest Dowson in his report on “Land Tenure and lelated questions, which was published in 1932, and have as their object the definition and categorisation of lands and their ownership, the confirmation and deteimination of ownership of all rights in land and the delimitation of all land boundaries. 179. In the latter part of 1932 three rural districts near Bagdad were oi tiered to be placed under settlement, each operating under a British officer. 180. At the beginning of 1933 a fourth British officer was appointed to take o\ei sett ement work in the oil area of Kirkuk, and the work proceeded according o piogiamme m each of the four selected areas throughout the year. • ^3 experience of settlement officers in the field shows that in a majority ot cases the land boundaries are disputed, and numerous complicated and intricate problems connected with title have come to light. In some cases disputes regarding them have been pending for more than fifty years. The ma J 0 /? 7 °. a ,. 18 an d belongs to the tribal tenants by prescriptive right, and their holdings are now being registered by land settlement officers. These o dings have never so far been officially registered, and it is hoped that as settlement operations progress, every land holder in Iraq, whether townsman or ii esman, will be duly registered in what is eventually to be the National Land Register. An area of 510 square miles had been settled at the end of the first season s work.Capital Works Programme Policy. 182. The five-year capital works programme, which the Iraqi Government passed into law rather hurriedly in June 1931 in order to earmark for develop ment purposes the anticipated revenue from advance oil royalties and dead rent, still lagged behind schedule during 1933. No expenditure was incurred on the two major projects of the Habbaniyah escape or the Tigris barrage, for reasons which are given later. Smaller schemes were, however, receiving attention, and the total amount expended on minor capital works during the year was 332,604 Iraqi dinars against provision of 403,525 Iraqi dinars. The expenditure was distributed as follows :— Iraqi dinars. {a) New buildings ... ... ... ... 81,199 (5) Roads, bridges and telephones ... ... 133,072 {c) Irrigation ... ... ... ... 84,277 (d) Grants-in-aid to municipalities and the Auqaf Department ... ... ... ... 34,056 Total 332,604 183. Although it has been generally agreed that the Capital Works Development Law in its original form will need to be extensively revised, and a new programme of works on an even larger scale has been prepared, the necessary legislation to effect the alteration has not yet been approved or passed. This question is intimately connected with that of the policy of financing development works. There are ardent supporters in each Cabinet of the two opposing schools of thought, i.e., (a) acceleration of development by means of a foreign loan, or (b) restricting the annual works programme to the money to be derived annually from oil royalties. No Government has yet come out boldly into the open with a declaration of policy either way, although Iraqi financial opinion seems to incline towards the first alternative. Meanwhile, expenditure is being confined within the limits of the oil revenues received, which, as explained in a later paragraph, have in effect been to a large extent absorbed by a series of budget deficits. Developments in Capital Works Programme. Habbaniyah Escape Project. 184. On 16th February an inter-departmental committee opened the Habbaniyah tenders received, and published the total amounts quoted as follows :— (1) Messrs. Humphreys Dywidag ... (2) Messrs. Nuttall, Mowlem, Brand and Abboud ... (3) Messrs. Sir Lindsay Parkinson and Co. (4) Messrs. Balfour Beatty and Co. (Limited) (5) Messrs. Spett Societa Trentina de Elettricita ( 6 ) Messrs. Pawling and Co. (Limited) (7) Messrs. Syndicat European d’Entreprises ( 8 ) Messrs. Henry Boot and Sons. ... (9) Messrs. Hersent (incomplete and not accepted). Iraqi dinars. 1,240,262-577 1,256,744-007 1,257,614-436 1,313,795-800 1,379,047-802 1,393,954-415 1,550,150 505 1,799,576-333 Assisted by Mr. Vaughan-Lee, the consulting engineer, they submitted their report to the Cabinet towards the end of the month. It is understood that they recommended acceptance of the tender of Messrs. Nuttall, Mowlem, Brand and Abboud. This the Government would probably have accepted at once, had not Abboud Pasha and his agents been accused of adopting injudicious methods, and even of approaching King Faisal with the offer of a bribe. His Majesty expressed great annoyance, and would not allow them to be given the contract. Meanwhile, Messrs. Boot offered to carry out the work on a commission basis.King Faisal favoured this method on the grounds that it was less expensive; but assured His Majesty’s Ambassador that other tenderers would be given an opportunity to bid again. On the 19th March a new Cabinet took office, of which certain members were inclined to give preference to the Kut barrage rather than to the Habbaniyah escape. Mr. Vaughan Lee was recalled to Bagdad tor consultation at the end of March; and at the end of April the Government announced that all the tenders were rejected, but that the four lowest tenderers would be invited to tender again on a new basis. This announcement evoked fruitless protests from the French Legation on behalf of the French interests concerned, from the Italian Legation on behalf of Italian interests, and from Messrs. Humphreys Dywidag. 185. In July the four lowest tenderers were duly invited to submit fresh tenders this time on a “variable lump sum’’ basis. They were given three months to do so. On the 14th October the new tenders were opened and the amounts quoted were published as follows :— Price. Period of Iraqi dinars. completion. Messrs. Nuttall, Mowlem, Brand and Months. Abboud (Near East) (Limited) ... 999,854-146 42 Messrs. Sir Lindsay Parkinson and Co. (Limited) ... ... ... 999,976-000 66 Messrs. Balfour, Beatty and Co. (Limited) 1,049,559-460 48 Messrs. Humphreys Dywidag (Limited) did not submit a tender. A decision was promised by the i4th January. The inter-departmental committee again recommended acceptance of the tender of Messrs. Nuttall, Mowlem, Brand and Abboud, and the Minister of Economics and Communications requested the Cabinet to obtain immediate parliamentary sanction for expenditure on the Habbaniyah escape, the Kut barrage and the two Bagdad bridges (see paragraphs 187 and 254). On the 29th October the Cabinet resigned. A new Cabinet was appointed on the 9th November, but Parliament was prorogued till the 12 th December. By the end of 1933 no decision had been taken as regards the allocation of the tender; nor had the application for funds been made to Parliament. There were several reasons for the delay. The death of King Faisal had deprived the Government’s development programme, temporarily at least, of much of its driving power. King Ghazi had declared to His Majesty s Ambassador that he was determined to see the Habbaniyah scheme go through in accordance with his father’s wishes, but Ministers were reluctant to take the responsibility of signing the contract. They were also apprehensive as to the intentions of the Iraq Petroleum Company in regard to payments due in gold on the 1st January, 1934, without which the Government might find itself financially embarrassed. Further, the prejudice against Abboud Pasha remained as strong as before. 186. In the event, telegrams were exchanged with Messrs. Sir Lindsay 1 arkinson early in January 1934, who offered to reduce their estimated time foi the contract to forty-two months without increasing their estimated cost. On the Hth January the company were asked if they would keep this offer open while parliamentary sanction was obtained to the financial arrangements, and they replied agreeing. Ihe Government appear, therefore, to have committed themselves to give the contract eventually to Sir Lindsay Parkinson and Co. Tigris Barrage at Kut. 187. During 1933 The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company made lepresentations in regard to the effect on their service of river steamers of the proposed barrage at Kut. It was ascertained that the designs include a lock with a width of 53 feet. 1 his only leaves 6 inches clearance on each side loi the largest river steamers, but the company did not press for a larger lock since the cost appeared prohibitive. 188 Ceitain elements in the Cabinet and Chamber of Deputies were pressing during 1933 for a start to be made on the Kut barrage at least as soon as the Habbaniyah escape works were begun; but the Government were(z) Net surplus on all accounts on March 31, 1933 ... 224,975 reluctant to issue invitations to tender for Kut before a decision of some kind had been reached in regard to Habbaniyah, and this was delayed for the reasons indicated in the preceding paragraph. However, in order to placate those who gave precedence to the Kut barrage, by making clear that both works were to be undertaken, the Government published in December a preliminary warning to contractors that tenders for the barrage would be invited early in January 1934. 189. In the event this invitation was published on the 25th January, 1934, the latest date for submission of tenders being the 5th May. The Abu Ghuraib Canal. 190. During 1933 excavation work on the Abu Ghuraib Canal was carried out piece-meal under local tender. Progress was very slow, partly owing to difficulty experienced by the Iraqi contractors in obtaining labour. Capital Works Expenditure against Oil Revenues. 191. The total amount received on account of oil royalties from the Iraq Petroleum Company up to the 31st March, 1932, after deducting the 10 per cent, payable to the Turkish Government under the Treaty of Angora, was 866,814 Iraqi dinars. The net amount received from the payment made in January 1933 was 524,397 Iraqi dinars. At the end of the financial year 1932- 33 the position of the special capital works fund was as follows :— ( 1 ) Net Receipts. Iraqi dinars. 1931- 32 ... ... ... 866,814 1932- 33 ... ... ... 524,397 1,391,211 (2) Capital Expenditure. 1931- 32 ... ... ... 169,993 1932- 33 ... ... ... 332,603 502,596 Unexpended balance ... 888,615 Cash Assets and Liabilities on March 31, 1933. 192. The subjoined statement of the national finances on the 31st March, 1933, shows that 75 per cent, of the oil revenues have been utilised to finance expenditure not included in the capital works programme :— (A) Iraqi dinars. {a) Deficit on normal estimates up to March 31, 1932 415,534 (5) Surplus on normal estimates during 1932-33 ... 104,893 (c) Net deficit on April 1 , 1933 ... ... ... 310,641 (d) Receipts from oil revenues up to March 31, 1933... 1,393,651 (e) Expenditure on capital works up to March 31, 1933 ... ... ... ... ... 514,160 (/) Surplus on capital account ... ... ... 879,491 (g) Net surplus on both capital and ordinary expenditure ((/)-(r)) ... ... ... 568,850 (h) Railway loans charged off as final expenditure ... 343,875■ 38 (B )—Statement of Cash Position on March 31, 1J33.

The salient features revealed by the above accounts are that the financial year closed with a surplus of receipts over expenditure, and the Government had, by slowing down the capital works programme, written off all preceding budgetary deficits, had charged off the heavy loans made to the railways, and were in possession of £500,000 sterling in cash with which to start afresh. This was followed by the presentation of a balanced budget for the new financial year in which provision is made for a final payment which extinguishes completely Iraq’s share of the Ottoman Public Debt. There was thus no national debt, no floating debt, a surplus on the national accounts and a cash balance sufficient to meet all foreseen requirements from Treasury resources without recourse to borrowing. During the current financial year revenue and expenditure is adhering fairly closely to the budget estimates. If the dead rent due from the British Oil Development Company (£150,000 gold) which is at present in arrear is not received, there may be a deficit in the budget to this extent. On the other hand, a sum of approximately 550,000 Iraqi dinars was received from the Iraq Petroleum Company on the 1st January, 1934, which will more than cover a small deficit, as well as the capital expenditure during the financial year. The outlook of the Government, as seen at the end of 1933, is therefore one of continued improvement in an already sound financial position. Discerning observers will not, however, overlook that, as revealed in the tables given above, even after just allowance is made for the shrewd and conservative policy which has governed the finances of this small State from its inception, the substantial margin between indebtedness and comparative wealth is due to the ample and regular payments made on account of dead rents and oil royalties by an international oil syndicate before one gallon of oil has reached the market. Without this golden lining Iraq’s financial position and outlook would be dull, indeed, and it must be clear to the fair minded that the national resources will not stand undue strain. National Currency. 194. The amount of notes and coins in circulation increased from 2,088 185 Iraqi dinars on the 1 st January, 1932, to 2,898,363 Iraqi dinars at the end of December of that year.39 19o.

The withdrawal was facilitated by the Government bank being authorised to purchase Indian coins and notes at favourable rates. The result completely justified the measure, as Indian currency to the extent of approximately 32,500,000 rupees (£243,750), was handed in for exchange into the national currency, the circulation of which displayed a steady and regular expansion until the end of October. The repatriation of Indian currency m August and September brought about a shortage of small change. Adequate stocks had been ordered with the date 1934, but the death of King Faisal necessitated their being reminted with the date 1933. Otherwise no difficulties whatever were experienced in the supply and use of the cun ency. 196. The report of the Iraqi Currency Board for the financial year which ended on the 31st March, 1933, shows that after charging off their initial expendi ture including the cost of supplying the currency, the assets of the board exceeded the total amount of the currency in circulation by £/2,/26. As the new currency had then only been in circulation for one year the position was regarded as satis factory. Since that date the position has still further improved. Towards the end of the year there was evidence of a demand in Parliament that the Govei n- ment should appropriate, for ordinary revenue purposes, part of the surplus assets of the Currency Board which are at present being allowed to accumulate m London as a reserve against security depreciation.

The number of ships which entered the port area during the year 1932-33 was 812, as compared with 793 during the preceding year, the respective gross tonnage being 4,738,646 as against 4,606,556. Of these, 174 ships with a gross tonnage of 762,846 entered the port of Basra; the remaining 638, chiefly oil tankers, proceeded to the Persian ports of Mohammerah and Abadan. 200. The figures of tonnage directly pertaining to Iraq, loaded and dis- charged within the Port of Basra during the past five years, are given below Year. Imports. Exports.

The dredging operations proceeded normally during the year and a low water depth of 22 feet 6 inches, giving a navigable depth of 32 feet with the tide, was maintained along the centre of the 15 miles length of the dredged channel. Two hundred and twenty-one vessels carrying general cargo and 660 oil-carrying vessels, in addition to seventy-four vessels belonging to various Governments, used the dredged channel during the financial year which ended on the 31st March, 1933. The receipts from the dredging due levied on vessels using it rose by nearly £50,000 to £264,691 during the financial year, owing to an increase in the number of ships and the increase in the draft of tankers rendered possible by the raising of the international load-line for oil ships. The Port Director was therefore able to pay off the remaining balance of the original loan of £462,100 taken from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company before the 31st December, 1932. The old dredging agreement thereby lapsed and the Iraqi Government withdrew from Parliament the revised agreement (which had been signed in June 1932 by both parties, and was awaiting ratification) on the ground that its terms needed modification by reason of the complete liquidation of the original loan. Now that the loan has been repaid the maintenance of the dredging dues at their present high rate will produce a large surplus of receipts over expenditure on the dredging service, more than sufficient to allow the dues to be halved. The Iraqi Government are showing some reluctance to forgo such an easily-earned profit; meanwhile, the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, who pay more than 90 per cent, of the dues, are pressing for the ratification of an agreement modified to meet the new conditions which will automatically effect a reduction in the scale of charges. In this, they are receiving the active assistance of His Majesty’s Embassy. Iraqi Railways. 202 . No major works were undertaken during the year and the services remained unaltered. In January the Director and Traffic Manager attended the International Railway Conference at Cairo. The railways equally with the port of Basra derived benefit from the carriage of pipe-line materials imported by the Iraq Petroleum Company, the receipts from which were sufficient to turn a probable deficit on the working of the financial year 1932-33, into a surplus of £28,353. When this traffic ceased, its place was taken by exceptionally heavy movement of petrol and oil by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in transit from Abadan to North and Central Persia, which brought in a handsome revenue during the second half of the calendar year and removed all fear of a deficit during the financial year 1933-34. The railways have been fortunate in reaping almost constant advantage from one kind or another of exceptional traffics. 203. A regular programme of sleeper renewals was inaugurated during the year, and 49,000 new steel and 11,400 new wooden sleepers were put into the track. Passenger Traffic. 204. The development of third-class passenger traffic was continued, and the experience gained previously by lowering fares on certain sections decided the extension of very low fares all over the system, i.e., to a rate of about 4 milesa penny, with very satisfactory results. The number of journeys taken increased by 30 per cent., and the earnings by 10 per cent. During the year the services of the Taurus and Simplon routes were accelerated and the fares reduced. Goods Traffic. 205. Trade in general improved slightly, but the movement of wheat and barley was disappointing. There was a gratifying increase in the amount of goods booked on through bills of lading by sea and rail. 206. The following figures show the financial results of the year 1932-33 :— Iraqi dinars. Revenue ... ... ... ... ... 496,054 Operating expenditure ... ... ... 467,701 Miscellaneous receipts on operations not affecting railway working ... ... ... ... 4,095 Net surplus on year ... ... ... ... 32,448 207. Capital expenditure during the year, financed by appropriations from the revenue surplus, was 27,668 Iraqi dinars. The balance sheet on the 31st March, 1933, showed that, in the absence of any charges on account of capital debt, the railways were solvent, with ample cash on hand in an adequate reserve to meet renewals and replacements. 208. The formation of a Railway Corporation, with joint British and Iraqi control, to take over the management and administration of the railways system, which, in accordance with the financial agreement appended to the Anglo- Iraqi Treaty of 1930, should have been formed by October 1933, was still delayed pending the outcome of negotiations between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Iraqi Government upon the terms of the draft law. By a further exchange of notes expressing mutual agreement, the period during which the corporation must be set up was prolonged by a further year, and discussions regarding the drafting of the law were still in progress at Bagdad at the end of the year under review. Iraqi Participation in World Economic Conference. 209. The opening of the World Economic Conference in London and the forthcoming State visit of the late King Faisal to London afforded a good opportunity for direct discussion between Iraqi Ministers and the interested Departments of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom of financial and economic matters affecting the two Governments, and the Iraqi delegation were authorised by a Cabinet resolution to discuss the following subjects :— ( 1 ) A loan for public works. (2) The transfer of the Iraqi Railway system to the Iraqi Government as a free gift. (3) The removal of United Kingdom customs duties on barley and dates. (4) The reduction of shipping freights. (5) The Koweit smuggling problem. ( 6 ) The institution of a national bank in Iraq. (7) Facilities for transit trade through Palestine. 210. The Iraqi Government were informed before the delegation left that His Majesty’s Government were not prepared to discuss item (2) or to consider any solution for the railway question, other than that provided for in the financial agreement attached to the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of Alliance, until that agreement had been implemented by the Iraqi Government and the arrangements contemplated in it given a fair trial. Much useful work was done in reconciling differences of opinion regarding the duties and powers of the corporation and a basis for agreement was reached on most of the outstanding points. 211. Items (4), (5) and ( 6 ) were not raised. 212. In the matter of a loan, the delegation established contact with Messrs. Barings, and prepared the way for financing an intensive scheme of public works if and when a decision on policy is reached.42 213. Items ( 3 ) and (7) did not progress beyond an exchange of views. The discussions with the Palestine Government regarding transit trade facilities are reported under a separate heading elsewhere. 214. The Iraqi participation in the World Economic Conference was confined to the preparation and submission of a somewhat jejune memorandum containing an expression of Yasin Pasha’s ideas upon international economy, and informing the world generally that the persistence of other countries in creating difficulties in the way of free exchange of goods may oblige Iraq to employ similar methods to protect her balance of trade. The Iraqi delegation also signed the International Customs Pact. 215. The meagre achievements of the economic delegation and its failure to ( make the trumpet of Iraq heard in the concert of the nations led to much sarcastic criticism on its return by those who had not been fortunate enough to secure a summer vacation at Government expense in Europe. (b) Trade and Commerce. Foreign Trade. 216. The following calendar year statistics of the foreign trade of Iraq have been compiled from the quarterly circulars of the Customs Department. Those now given for 1932 are final corrected figures. Statistics for previous calendar years were given in paragraph 263 of the report for 1932. Total Value of Foreign Trade {excluding Treasure) in thousands of Dinars. (1 dinar = £1 sterling.) Total imports ... 1931. 4,755 1932. 5,871 1933. 6,103 Total transit (chiefly to and from Persia) 2,235 2,068 2,653 Total exports 3,240 2,951 2,634 Apparent adverse balance of trade 1,515 2,920 3,469 Total Value of Trade with United Imports from United Kingdom ... Kingdom. 1,822 2,137 Exports to United King dom 1,117 890 Apparent balance of Anglo- Iraqi trade in favour of the United Kingdom 705 1,247 Imports. (a) General. 217. The total value of imports increased by £232,000 in 1933, as compared with 1932. the high level of total import values was primarily due to the Iraq Petroleum Company’s importations for their pipe-lines, which began in the December quarter of 1932. Thus, under the customs category, metals and ores, which includes pipes, the value of imports was £509,000 in 1932 and £996,000 in 1933; under machinery, £188,000 and £253,000; and under vehicles, £258,000 and £364,000. The combined increase under these categories was £658,000 in 1933, compared with 1932, considerably more than the improvement in total imports. It is true that the three categories include much importation other than by the Iraq Petroleum Company. Under metals and ores, the importation of iron girders, sheets and plates to the general market for building purposes was at least as large as during the previous year. Machinery includes plant for new municipal waterworks and power stations at Bagdad, Basra, Mosul, and other towns. Under “ vehicles,” the demand in the open market for motor cars43 improved. Other notable gains occurred under asbestos (by £35,000), provisions and liquors (by £17,000), cement (by £16,000), paints (by £16,000), coffee (by £14,000), and cigarettes (by £10,000). Probably some of these increases also were due to the Iraq Petroleum Company’s operations. Otherwise, there was a general decline in importations for the local market. For instance, under the two customs categories which are normally of greatest value, textiles show a fall by £377,000, from £1,920,000 in 1932 to £1,543,000 in 1933; and sugar by £28,000, from £430,000 to £402,000. Other notable falls included wood and timber (by £ 86 , 000 ), and instruments (by £ 8 , 000 ). (b) Imports from the United Kingdom. 218. In spite of intensified competition from Japan, the value of imports from the United Kingdom increased by £315,000, from £1,822,000 in 1932 to £2,137,000 in 1933, i.e., 35 per cent, of Iraq’s total imports, compared with 31 per cent, in the calendar year 1932. The gains for United Kingdom products occurred chiefly in the categories mentioned above as including the principal importations of the Iraq Petroleum Company. For example, under metals and ores, the United Kingdom gain was £302,000; under machinery, £73,000; under vehicles, £68,000. Vehicles include motor bicycles and bicycles for the general market, which are chiefly British, and also aircraft for the Iraqi Air Force. Other United Kingdom gains include arms and ammunition (by £35,000) for the Iraqi Government, instruments and apparatus (by £16,000), cement (by £12,000), and hardware (by £12,000). The only outstanding United Kingdom loss occurred \ in textiles (especially prints and coloured cottons), and it must be admitted that this was again considerable, the value of all textile imports from the United Kingdom falling by £206,000, from £615,000 in 1932 to £409,000 in 1933, 1 i.e., from about 32 per cent, of the total textile import to about 26 5 per cent. It was almost entirely due to Japanese c ompetition. Transit Trade. 219. The improvement, by £585,000 or nearly 28 per cent., in the transit trade values is explained by an increase from £1,065,000 to £1,774,000 in the value of Persian exports in transit through Iraq. This increase occurred mainly in carpets (£765,000 to £1,073,000). In particular, the value of Persian carpets in transit to the United States of America rose by nearly 50 per cent. The value of Persian hides and skins in transit also rose, from £11,000 to £159,000, chiefly to the United Kingdom and the United States of America; and that of intestines from £43,000 to £ 111 , 000 , chiefly to the United States of America. Imports to Persia declared in transit through Iraq increased from £887,000 in value to £ 1 , 110 , 000 . Of these, sugar and tea show increases by £47,000 and £13,000 respectively, but textiles a decline by about £111,000. In view of the continued and apparently successful efforts of the Persian Government to divert trade from the Iraqi routes, these figures are unexpectedly high, especially as they do not include large quantities of sugar and other merchandise known to have been smuggled into Persia. The factors which produced the apparent check in the decline of Iraq’s entrepot market for supply to Persia were— {a) The strained commercial relations between Persia and Soviet Russia, which led to a partial cessation of Perso-Russian trade in the spring of 1933, and in particular to a demand for sugar which could best be met through Bagdad; (b) Some relaxation in the Persian Government’s foreign trade restrictions; and (c) A further increase of goods traffic by the overland motor routes from the Mediterranean. Exports. (a) General. 220. The total value of Iraqi exports again fell in 1933, the decline amounting to 12 per cent., from £2,951,000 to £2,634,000. The value of dates exported in 1933 fell as compared with 1932 from £ 886,000 to £789,000. Prices for the 1933-34 crop were higher than for 1932-33, but the quantities exported were less. The 1933-34 crop was poor, and there are said to be disturbing44 indications of a deterioration in the quality of Iraqi dates, due to a gradual change in the climate of Basra, which is becoming less humid. It is unfortunate for the trade that the Date Research Board mentioned in paragraph 274 of the 1932 report has not yet been authorised to recruit the experts required to investigate the cause and possible cure. As regards other produce, ample rains in the spring of 1933 ensured good crops and grazing, and there was a surplus of grain for export. Cereal prices advanced early in the year, and there were large shipments in July and August. Quotations, however, fell later by 25 per cent, to 30 per cent, to levels even lower than those of 1932, thus paralysing export. Accordingly, grain exports values declined by a total of £175,000 (from £655,000 to £480,000). These declines include wheat (from £103,000 to £75,000), barley (from £285,000 to £208,000), maize and millet (from £168,000 to £113,000). At the end of 1933 large stocks were held locally without a market. On the other hand, the following export values increased : Hides and skins (£104,000 to £133,000); wool (£88,000 to £120,000); ghi (£14,000 to £42,000), and intestines (£25,000 to £29,000). In the case of wool, hides and skins, the expansion was mainly in trade with the United States of America, and seems to have followed the devaluation of the dollar. In view of improvements effected in Iraqi abattoirs, the United States Government relaxed their restrictions on the traffic in Iraqi casings. The export of ghi to Palestine and Syria was developed. Cotton cultivation was again unremunerative, and the total crop for export was only about 450 bales. Practically none of this was ginned by the British Cotton Growing Association, who had not, however, disposed of their Bagdad plant by the end of the year. 221. Gold Export .—During the years 1931 to 1933 the value of Iraq’s total exports was maintained by the demand for gold in Europe. In 1931 and in 1932 gold was exported to the value of about £600,000 annually. During 1933 the value of this export fell as compared with 1932 from £593,000 to £415,000. Nearly all the gold went to the United Kingdom. (b) Exports to the United Kingdom. 222. Gold, indeed, accounted for nearly 47 per cent, of Iraq’s exports to the United Kingdom. In 1933 these were valued at £890,000, as compared with £1,117,000 in 1932, i.e., nearly 33 per cent, of Iraq’s total exports, compared with 41 per cent, in the calendar year 1932. The value of exported Iraqi produce in the United Kingdom again declined generally, but there was still no evidence that this was due to United Kingdom tariffs. The cause seems to lie in market conditions and in improved shipping facilities between Iraq and the continent. Japanese Competition. 223. It may be argued from the statistics given above that the revival in the purchasing power of Iraq noted in the report for 1932 was retarded, rather than accelerated, during 1933. The decline in import values, apart from Iraq / Petroleum Company importations, may perhaps be explained, however, by the j increased importation of cheap Japanese goods. 224. Ihe Customs Department did not publish separate statistics of trade with Japan until the 1 st April, 1932. It is thus only possible to compare the nine months from April to December in each year. In that period Japanese imports rose from £324,000 in 1932 to £483,000 in 1933, nearly 75 per cent, in 1933 being textiles, cotton, silk and artificial silk, and the remainder all kinds of manufactured articles. 225. In May the Minister of Defence bought 60,000 metres of Japanese twill for the army. The order was significant, since hitherto Manchester goods had secured all such Government orders owing to their superior quality. Several Japanese visited Iraq during the year to investigate markets. In particular, they discussed the possibilities of exporting Iraqi produce to Japan in order to allay Iraqi criticism regarding the trade balance between the two countries. I hey talked of running a line of Japanese steamers (Yamashita Steamship Company of Kobe) via India to Basra. One or two Japanese vessels did, in fact,45 visit the Shatt-al-Arab during the year, but their chief cargo from Iraq was scrap-iron. In general, the position gained by Japanese trade during the past three or four years was consolidated during 1933. Japanese prices became steadier and less speculative. Soviet Trading. 226. During 1933 there was, generally speaking, no marked increase in trade between Iraq and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and no progress was made in the efforts of the Soviet Government to establish commercial representation in Iraq. Officials from their agency at Mohammerah visited Iraq two or three times during the year with the declared object of buying Iraqi wool, but the Iraqi authorities refused them visas without prior reference to Bagdad, and then only with restrictions as to the period of each visit. They were kept under police surveillance, and were chiefly concerned with the decline in their piece-goods market owing to increasing Japanese competition. During December, however, they endeavoured to negotiate with Messrs, the African and Eastern (Near East) (Limited) for the purchase of over 2,000 bales of wool. It is reported that the Bagdad Chamber of Commerce recently received a letter from Moscow stating that a special Eastern Section had been opened in the Commercial Museum there, and asking for assistance in obtaining samples of Iraqi exports. The latter also indicated that there was a possibility of a museum of Soviet exports being opened in Iraq. These developments may indicate that the Soviet authorities now realise that the best way to remove the antagonism to their commercial activities displayed in Iraqi official circles is to “ buy Iraqi.” General Resume. 227. The foregoing statistics are richly coloured by the importations of the Iraq Petroleum Company, which greatly exaggerate, on the one hand, the volume 1 of Iraq’s foreign trade, and, on the other hand, the extent of her adverse trade balance. The total value of imports for 1933 at £6,103,000 and that of exports at £2,634,000 leave an apparent adverse trade balance of £3,469,000, compared with £2,920,000 in 1933. Apart, however, from the invisible exports cited in paragraph 263 of the 1932 report, it may be estimated that about half this difference represents importations by the Iraq Petroleum Company and other concessionnaires financed by foreign capital. It is therefore to a large degree extraneous to the country’s foreign trade and its adverse effect on the trade balance need give no cause for alarm. Indeed, credit in Bagdad at the end of 1933 was better than at any time since the depression began, and, despite the stagnation in cereals, the tone of the markets remained optimistic. T ariffs. 228. On the 30th April, 1933, a completely new customs tariff was introduced (Law No. 11 of 1933). 229. This was drawn up by two foreign experts engaged for the purpose through the medium of the League of Nations and its object was not so much to increase revenue as to reclassify and co-ordinate the tariff in accordance with international nomenclature. The reclassification involved a general amendment of existing duties, and the principle followed was to increase duties on luxuries and reduce on essentials. The metric system was adopted throughout. The previous general export duty of 1 per cent, was abolished, leaving only dates, gold, horses and liquorice roots liable to export duty. The list of articles such as machinery and raw materials required for agricultural and industrial purposes which are exempt from import duty was expanded. The minimum rate of import duty was reduced from 13 per cent, ad valorem to 8 per cent., and applied chiefly to machinery and raw materials not already exempt. Duties were placed at specific fixed amounts on a weight basis wherever practicable rather than on an ad valorem basis. Duties on silk and artificial silk articles were increased by 20 per cent, and 10 per cent, respectively and graded in accordance with percentage content by weight. Duties on imported provisions, groceries and confectionery were also raised.r ■-»w i - 46 Weights and Measures. 230. Early in 1933 the Government suddenly resolved to implement the Weights and Measures Law and to enforce the metric system without further delav. In Government Departments they accelerated the gradual transter to decimals, which had been in progress for some years past. The new customs tariff issued in April was on a metric basis. In May a regulation was published, coming into force in August, making it a criminal offence to letail goods m the Bagdad municipal area by any other unit of length other than those of the meti ic system. This drastic measure was admittedly experimental and was not rigidly enforced, and by the end of the year the Government had lost interest in it. However, the fact that the metric system was finally installed during 1J33 both in the customs tariff and in Government transactions geneially was of impoitance to British trade. Industrial Development. 231. While the Government continued to encourage the development of local industries, little progress was achieved. A new shoe factory was opened in Bagdad, and the cigarette factories again improved the quantity and quality of their output. Competition amongst them was very keen. The wool mills did well with the help of Government contracts. Iraq Petroleum Company. 232. Throughout 1933 work on the pipe-lines to the Mediterranean was pushed forward with the greatest vigour. Nearly 100,000 tons of equipment for the pipe-lines were imported via Basra, and at one time during the year 6.000 Iraqis were at work for the Iraq Petroleum Company in the desert. The stringing and welding of both lines from Kirkuk to sea-board was completed on the 19th November, the lengths of the northern and southern lines being about 620 and 540 miles respectively. The company are to be congratulated on putting through a work of this magnitude with such efficiency and despatch. At the end of 1933, work on the twelve pumping stations along the system was proceeding satisfactorily and well up to programme. Borings for water had been successful in seven locations, but the water supply problem had not been entirely solved by the end of the year. 233. As regards the proving of their oil-field, the company kept several rigs in commission on the main Kirkuk structure. Six new wells were begun, of which three were completed, and a number of earlier wells were deepened and rehabilitated. A total of 10,689 feet was drilled during 1933. Production amounted to about 320,000 barrels for the company’s own use, of which about 300.000 were refined, the balance being expended on well tests or kept in storage. 234. It is estimated that more than £12 million has been expended by the Iraq Petroleum Company organisation since the concession was first granted in 1925. During 1932 and 1933 the company’s purchases in the United Kingdom alone probably amounted to £1,500,000, some of the principal suppliers being Messrs. Stewart and Lloyd (pipes), Messrs. Harland and Wolff (Diesel engines), Messrs. Worthington-Simpson (oil pumps), Messrs. National Gas and \ Oil Engines (auxiliary engines), and Messrs. Scammel and Messrs. Hillman \ (motor transport). Khanaqin Oil Company. 235. Throughout 1933 the Khanaqin Oil Company were producing from their Naft Khanah field. During the year 23,116,385 gallons of crude oil were distilled at the Alwand refinery, of which the output amounted to— Concessions. Aviation spirit Petrol Kerosene Fuel oil ... Fuel oil. 577,589 3,084,906 4,091,789 12,658,21647 m One well remained open to production throughout the year. Another was completed in November at 2,319 feet, with an estimated potential output of 300,000 gallons per day. Other wells were subjected to tests. During the year the Persian Government permitted the company to begin development of that portion of the Naft Khanah oil-field which lies on the Persian side of the frontier, the proposal being to pipe the oil some 140 miles to a refinery at Kermanshah. Rafidain Oil Company. 236. During 1933 the Rafidain Oil Company supplied Iraq’s requirements of oil products, acting as the marketing company of the Iraq Petroleum Company under article 14 of the latter’s convention. They continued to obtain their oil partly from the Khanaqin Oil Company refinery, of which the output is given above, and partly (for the southern districts of Iraq) from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s South Persian refinery at Abadan. Statistics of distribution are not yet available. Although world prices justified reduction, there was no change during the year in the retail prices of products, since article 15 of the Iraq Petroleum Company convention stipulates gold pence, and the value of gold rose in relation to sterling. 237. In accordance with the Weights and Measures Law, it was anticipated that the Iraqi Government would require the company to work in litres instead of gallons after the 1 st July. They did not do so, but the company prepared themselves for such an eventuality, and, during the year, changed their unit of measurement for lubricating oil from gallons to litres. 238. Under Law No. 14 of 1933 for the Remission of Advances granted to Cultivators, the Government wrote off advances made under Law No. 43 of 1930 at the rate of 2 annas per gallon of fuel oil, which they were unable to collect. Of the amount outstanding, half was due to the company, who agreed to forgo their claim, amounting in all to about £16,000. 239. During the year the Government again questioned the right of the Rafidain Oil Company to act as the Iraq Petroleum Company’s marketing company and to enjoy the privileges laid down in the latter’s convention (see paragraph 303 of the 1932 report). In particular, they claimed property tax and income tax from the Rafidain Oil Company, who strongly protested. This matter was still under discussion at the end of the year. The Government also complained that the retail prices of oil products were too high, and threatened to set up a Government refinery unless they were reduced. British Oil Development Company. 240. On the 1 st January, 1933, the British Oil Development Company paid the Iraqi Government £125,000 on account of the dead rent of £100,000 (gold) due, proposing to settle the final amount payable on a gold basis within the three months’ period of grace allowed in their agreement. The Government at once pointed out that the agreement stipulates payment at the rate of exchange obtaining on the 1 st January, and claimed interest at 6 per cent, on the sum withheld. By the 10th January the company had paid the full amount due on this basis, i.e., £147,122 14s., plus an additional £49 17s. 3 g?., by way of interest. They asserted, however, that they were not bound to pay on the 1st January, 1933, the first “quarterly payment in advance” provided in article 16 of their agreement on account of inspection by Government “of all operations carried out by the company within Iraq.” They argued that, in the absence of any “operations,” there could be no inspection. They eventually paid this charge in May, however, together with the second quarterly payment, which fell due on the 1st April. 241. Mr. Beeby Thompson completed his geological survey and submitted his report early in the year. A British fields manager arrived in Mosul during June to organise operations, and drilling had started at three locations within eighteen months after the date of their agreement, as specified in article 5 thereof: Qaiyara (about 40 miles south of Mosul); Nejmah (in the same structure); and Mishraq (nearer Mosul).—— — 48 242. It was soon clear that the oil available near the surface is chiefly valuable for its asphaltic properties, and the company instituted enquiries as to the demand for bitumen products in Syria, Palestine and India. 243. By the end of 1933 the Qaiyarah and Mishraq wells had reached a depth of nearly 500 feet. There had been “ shows of gas and oil in all three wells, but these were of no particular significance, as the principal oil strata are known to be at greater depths. 244. In November Lord Glenconner, the managing director of the company, came to Iraq to investigate the position. He left in December and made no secret of the company’s intention to delay payment of the dead rent of £125,000 (gold), due on the 1st January, 1934, in view of the unsatisfactory results so far obtained. This payment had not, in fact, been made by the end of January 1934. Other Concessions. 245. Yasin Pasha A1 Hashimi discussed his cement factory proposals whilst in London during the summer, and undertook to give United Kingdom firms an opportunity to tender. In the winter he engaged two German engineers to investigate and report prospects on the site prior to inviting tenders. Their report was not complete by the end of the year. 246. Nothing was heard during 1933 of Hajji Muhammad Bassam’s gold concession or of M. RotivaTs new Bagdad. Bagdad Electric Light and Power Company. 247. The Bagdad Electric Light and Power Company is registered in the United Kingdom but controlled by the Belgian company “ Engetra.” 248. Their new power-house was put into operation during April. Its two turbo-generators (by Messrs, the British Brown Boveri Company of Switzerland) each develop 2,500 kilowatts, sufficient to meet the anticipated demand for some time to come. The boilers are by Messrs. Babcock and Willcox. 249. In May, in accordance with their agreement, the company offered to the public simultaneously in London and Bagdad an issue of shares amounting to £800,000. The proportion taken up by Iraqis was very small, owing partly to the liability of the dividends to United Kingdom income tax. 250. Reference to the boycott organised against the company in the autumn has already been made in an earlier chapter of this report. Other Electric Power Stations. 251. At the end of the year the plant obtained from the United Kingdom for the new Basra power-house was still in course of erection. The new power house at Mosul was completed and put into commission. Small installations were imported or ordered for other towns such as Maudham, Shamiyah, Hai, Kifri. Water Works, &amp;c. 252. The Bagdad Water Board carried out large extensions of the system in 1933. The port of Basra were authorised to take over the water supply of that town and renew much of the existing system. A loan of £30,000 was negotiated by the Mosul Municipality with the Eastern Bank. Most of this loan is earmarked for a new water supply system, for which orders were placed in England. The remainder is required for street repairs and extensions to the new electric light system. The Suleimania Municipality installed a water supply system and the Arbil Municipality obtained authority to do so. Government Works. 253. The most important Government work in progress during 1933 (apart from the Abu Ghuraib Canal mentioned elsewhere in this report) was the steel road bridge over the Tigris at Mosul. It is hoped that this will be completed by the spring floods of 1934. A Royal residence was under construction at the King’s Harthiyah estate near Bagdad. The greater part of the materials and fittings, including furniture, was obtained from the United Kingdom., 7PO 49 Tigris Bridges. 254. The new Government development programme includes two steel road bridges over the ligris at Bagdad. The consulting engineers were preparing tender documents for these bridges at the end of the year with a view to a call ^ for tenders during the spring of 1934. The total estimated cost is between ^ £350,000 and £400,000. A number of contractors, both British and continental, are interested, and keen competition is expected. V.— Communications. Roads. 255. No new main roads were constructed during 1933, but much work was done on metalling and consolidating, especially in the north. 256. Further notable improvements were undertaken by the municipality in the streets of Bagdad. The programme was, however, curtailed, and a proposed new arterial road through the city was deferred owing to lack of funds. The Municipality of Mosul also improved and widened streets. Rowanduz Road. 257. The condition of the road into Persia through Rayat became barely passable for motor transport until the end of May owing to the winter rains and snow, thereafter it was used by two or three lorries a day carrying sugar, tea, piece-goods and miscellaneous goods into Persia, and carpets, dried fruit and intestines into Iraq. During the autumn the traffic was much increased by large consignments of petrol and kerosene for Persia, which continued until the end of the year. They were carried by the Bagdadi transporter, Haim Effendi Nathaniel, who was in a position to control the through traffic on the Iraqi side. He appears to have found some difficulty in obtaining full return loads. His lack of organisation in Tabriz was partly responsible for his difficulties, and he took steps to remedy this defect at the end of the year. 258. Although an all-weather road through the mountains had not been completed either by the Iraqis or by the Persians before the winter rains, sufficient work was done on the Iraqi side for the road to be freely used by traffic until the end of December, when it was closed by snow. 259. In general, however, the amount of traffic on the road during 1933 was disappointing, especially in view of the pressure brought to bear on Iraq by Persia to complete its construction. 260. It is understood that negotiations took place during the year between the Persian and Syrian authorities for the development of traffic via Mosul and Rowanduz. A representative of the Auto-Routiere Transport Company made a tour of the route during August. Overland Motor Traffic. 261. The discussions proposed between the Iraqi, Palestine and Trans jordan authorities with a view to co-operation in development of the direct desert route between Palestine and Iraq took place at Haifa in June. Yasin Pasha A1 Hashimi, who was on his way to London as head of the Iraqi Economic Delegation, took part in these discussions as Minister of Finance. 262. A draft agreement for the removal of customs barriers and abolition of passports between Iraq and Transjordan was also discussed. 263. On the 1 st July the Iraqi Government declared the Amman route to be a transit route for purposes of the Transit Trade Law. 264. In July a further meeting to discuss facilities at Haifa for Iraqi transit traffic took place at the Colonial Office which Yasin Pasha attended.50 265. Arising out of these discussions His Majesty’s Embassy informed the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in October that, provided the Iraqi Government would give an undertaking that they would “ use their best endeavours to promote the development of traffic by the Haifa-Bagdad route,” the Government of Palestine were prepared to offer free zone facilities for Iraqi goods at Haifa, and to give, for a minimum period of three years, various additional advantages to the Iraqi Government with a view to promote trade along that route. These advantages included :— (i) Provision and maintenance of a motor road through Mafrak eastwards into the desert and westwards to Irbid—a new and shorter route eliminating the difficult mountain district west of Amman. (ii) Exemption from import duty of Iraqi barley and ghi. (iii) Reduction of duty on Iraqi rice and dates. (iv) Reciprocity as regards motor licences. By the end of the year the Iraqi Government had not given the requisite undertaking and no further progress was made. The new Cabinet were afraid to commit themselves to development of the Haifa route, being especially apprehensive that Iraqi traffic might be exploited at Haifa before the free zone had been provided. 266. Meanwhile, the authorities in Syria made every effort to consolidate the position of the Beirut-Damascus-Bagdad route and to render it impervious to competition via Haifa-Transjordan-Bagdad. The principal French motor transport company in Syria, the Compagnie Auto-Routiere du Levant, was taken over by the subsidised Damas Hama et Prolongements Railway Company in order to develop trans-desert motor traffic under official auspices. The authorities of the port of Beirut were associated in this arrangement and also the Nairn Transport Company. In May M. Blanquet, one of the directors of the Damas Hama et Prolongements Railway, visited Bagdad, and in interviews with the King, the Director of Railways and others left no doubt as to the intentions of the authorities in Syria. The King at once announced that the direct Haifa route must be developed forthwith in order to counter this threat of the French on Iraqi communications, and, in June, a Permanent Transport Board was set up to considei the genei al question of communications. This board accomplished practically nothing during the year. On their side, the Syrian authorities gave fuither facilities to deseit transporters, lowered the Beirut port charges, pushed forwaid plans to model nise the port and prepared to inaugurate a free zone at Beirut for transit goods. They voted money for constructing a metalled road from Damascus to the Iraqi frontier; and made arrangements for extending the JNisibm Railway across the Bee du Canard early in 1934. &amp; An December bun Pasha was approached by the French Charge d Affaires m Bagdad with proposals for conclusion of a far-reaching trade agreement between Syria and Iraq. The Minister for Foreign Affairs replied HecHnL a ?nX U . d l be A° ej 1161, ^negotiations with the Syrians, but fo the French cWct f C® Fre ' c . h - 1 hl . s , at least gave a temporary setback H ''* “ •*« »• ZOO. i . , , m , i jlIenai iNathaniel, the Iraq Railways Canvassing 1 Agent who the^Amman onfeCntrT' tranS P° rt T ^^ mail Ion factor on overture? of the FrencK ??? q® P'' lra g ra P h 322 of the 1932 report, resisted all and ioin them in rWelnr, 7 n 2 n authorities to abandon the Palestine route and join them m development of routes through Syria He transferred his su^rortfnTis effoTtoXveT “ifu ^ h ® had rel ' ied &gt; however upon British in September the Brifisli 0 lv,°f* nn; ^ ; '! a 10 l jte, he was much aggrieved when, Iraq se^dinLhemv?-, the ^ chan g ed , the route for overland mails to Triestino and HaTm's se^il^m JJuSlem ° f threatening to withdraw from the Haifa route alto^her anifw^only'deterred from doing so by the hope that the Iraqi and Palest ne pJf onl y deterr eu eventually reach agreement for its official development Gove ™ments would51 (2pi) Telephone Service, Palestin e-Iraq. 269. During 1933 the Iraqi Posts and Telegraphs Department completed a telegraph and telephone circuit along the Southern Iraq Petroleum pipe-line as far as the Transjordan frontier. Negotiations were in progress for continuation of this circuit across Transjordan in order to connect up the telephone and telegraph systems of Iraq and Palestine, and thus to secure international through traffic which might otherwise follow the northern pipe-line along circuits constructed by the French. It was at first proposed that the Imperial and International Communications Company should undertake the work, but, at the end of the year, the scheme under consideration was that the link circuit through Transjordan should be constructed by the Government of Palestine at the expense of the Transjordan Government. Air. Air Navigation Companies. 270. During 1933 Messrs. Imperial Airways, Air France and the Royal Dutch Air Line (K.L.M.) continued their services via Bagdad. The Berlin- Bagdad-Kabul service proposed by Luft-Hansa did not materialise owing to failure to obtain permission to fly over Turkey. In May the K.L.M. introduced an accelerated time-table, giving a mail and passenger service of less than three days between Bagdad and London via Amsterdam—twelve hours faster than the Imperial Airways time-table. In autumn the Imperial Airways service was extended eastwards to Rangoon. On the 31st December, the air mail surcharge on letters posted in Iraq for despatch by Imperial Airways to countries west of Iraq was abolished and, for letters not exceeding 10 grammes, a minimum combined postage and air fee of 15 fils was introduced, this being the same as the minimum rate for ordinary mails. This reduction synchronised with the reduction to Id. of the air mail surcharge on letters to Iraq posted in the United Kingdom. Iraq Airwork [Limited). 271. Early in the year Iraq Airwork (Limited) obtained from England a “ Spartan Cruiser ” passenger aeroplane for purposes of their proposed agreement with the Government. Owing to faulty engine design, it was wrecked at Ramadi on the way out to Bagdad. After this unfortunate accident at the very beginning of their operations, and before conclusion of their agreement, the company remained dormant for the remainder of the year. Government Assistance to Civil Aviation. 272. The Government continued during 1933 to extend the facilities accorded to civil aviation. On the 5th April the public air port at Bagdad was officially opened by King Faisal. It is conveniently situated, of ample dimensions and laid out on the most modern and efficient lines. The offices are spacious and well designed, including a small hotel and restaurant. There is a wireless station, with direction-finding apparatus, a Neon location beacon, and other arrangements for night flying, and a meteorological station. An up-to-date wireless direction finder was installed during the year at Rutbah Wells, which should be of considerable assistance to Imperial Airways when they introduce night flying services across the desert. During 1933 good progress was made in the levelling and preparation of a site for a public air port in the area of the Port of Basra. VI.—Am and Military Matters. The Royal A ir Force. Strength. 273. The distribution of the Royal Air Force garrison in Iraq remained unchanged with the exception of the temporary move of one section of armoured cars to Mosul in July, during the Assyrian disturbances. This section returned to Hinaidi in November. In November the strength of the sections in the armoured car company was temporarily increased from four to six cars per52 section. The distribution of the fighting units at their permanent stations was as follows :— Hinaidi— 1 bomber squadron. 1 bomber-transport squadron. 2 sections, armoured cars. Mosul— 1 bomber squadron. 1 section, armoured cars. Shaibah— 1 bomber squadron. Basra— 1 flying boat squadron. 1 section, armoured cars. 274. Hinaidi also contained Air Headquarters, the Aircraft Depot, R.A.F. General Hospital, and the usual maintenance and ancillary units. Command. 275. During 1933 Air Vice-Marshal C. S. Burnett, C.B., C.B.E., D.S.O., was the Air Officer Commanding the Iraq Command, Royal Air Force. A ssyrian Disturbances. 276. Between July and September the Iraq army and police were engaged in operations against those Assyrians who had crossed into Syria and returned, subsequently, without surrendering their arms. The situation caused in the Northern Liwas by these operations necessitated the despatch of an additional armoured car section from Hinaidi to Mosul, and a considerable amount of reconnaissance by No. 30 (Bomber) Squadron at Mosul. The presence of these aircraft probably had a considerable effect in preventing sections of Kurds and Arabs, some distance from the disturbed areas, from becoming involved. 277. Victoria aircraft from No. 70 (B.T.) Squadron conveyed to Hinaidi from the north 790 dependants of Assyrian levy soldiers who had been living in the disturbed areas and whose homes had been destroyed during the trouble. Evacuation of the Summer Training Camp. 278. The summer training camp which had been established at Ser Amadia m May, in accordance with normal custom, was closed prematurely in August owing to the Assyrian disturbances. The camp was evacuated in accordance with the normal procedure, between the 7th and 16th August, without loss of either personnel or stores. The Royal Air Force in the Persian Gulf. 279. Steady development of air activities along the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf took place throughout the year. Between April and December no less than nine separate flights by three or more Wapiti aircraft fitted with long long-distance tanks were made to Sharjah or Muscat. No undue difficulties were encountered, and the farthest point reached by landplanes was Ras-al-Hadd. Inter-Command Flights. 280. During November two Rangoons of No. 203 (F.B.) Squadron proceeded on an mtei-command flight between Iraq and Aden. They left Basra on the 30th October, stayed at Aden from the 4th to the 12 th November, and returned to Basia on the 17th November.- No unusual incidents occurred durin tr this flight— the first to be made along this route. The distance covered by each of these aircraft was 4,573 nautical miles, or 5,405 statute miles. 281. During November also, four Wapiti aircraft of No. 55 (B) Squadron carried out an inter-command flight to the North-West Frontier of India They i^A.^AT nai ^ 1 u° n t'k 0 October and returned to Hinaidi without incident on the 18th November, each aircraft having covered a distance of 5,460 miles This was the first inter-command flight of this kind to take place.53 toZ, Basidu Incident. 282. In September 1933, as a result of the incident at Basidu and the presence in consequence of the 1 st Destroyer Flotilla of the Royal navy from the Mediterranean, a Durbar was held by the hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, at Dibai. The Air Officer Commanding attended this Durbar, proceeding in a Rangoon flying boat ^ of No. 203 (F.B.) Squadron, escorted by No. 84 (B) Squadron. The presence of His Majesty’s ships and aircraft on this occasion probably had some effect in demonstrating the power of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to implement the statement of policy made during the Durbar by the hon. the Political Resident. 283. The Royal Air Force in Iraq supplied a wireless telegraph pack set and wireless operator for use of the navy at Basidu during August and September. Rest House — Sharjah. 284. The permanent rest house for the Imperial Airways at Sharjah was completed and was visited by Royal Air Force aircraft on several occasions. The value of aircraft for protecting this rest house was exemplified in July, when there was a possibility of minor trouble owing to the non-payment of the Rest House Guards by the Sheikh of Sharjah. Within forty-eight hours of a signal having been received from the station superintendent to the effect that the security of the rest house appeared to be threatened, a flight of armed Wapitis from No. 84 (B) Squadron had arrived, ready for action, at Sharjah, and there seems no doubt that in normal circumstances a flight or squadron could be sent within this time whenever required. Desert Searches. 285. Once during March it was necessary to organise a search for an aircraft which had been forced to land between Mosul and Hinaidi owing to dust and had sustained damage. Aircraft from Nos. 55 and 30 (B) Squadrons were used. The pilot, however, succeeded in getting into touch with a police post, and from there by telephone to Hinaidi, before the search had been long in progress. A ir Mail between Iraq and Cairo. 286. A weekly air mail between Bagdad and Cairo was maintained by aircraft of Iraq and Middle East Commands throughout the year. This mail was composed of service, secret and confidential correspondence and Foreign Office bags from Bagdad and Tehran for delivery to Cairo for onward despatch by courier. Surveys. 287. Work continued throughout the year on the 1/500,000 series of the Southern and Western Desert. The field work of the Basra-Koweit sheet which forms part of this series has been completed, and the survey of the Rutbah sheet commenced. 288. The photographs taken during the air survey of the Hammar Lake area have been despatched to England, where they are now being plotted. The Iraq Levies. 289. Organisation.—At the end of 1932 the Iraq levies were still in the process of reorganisation to conform with the annexure to the 1930 Treaty of Alliance. 290. By the 1st April, 1933, the reduction in strength to 1,250 ranks had been effected. The organisation has been adapted to the establishment framed in 1933. During the remainder of the year the racial constitution of the levies was modified by the completion of the measures initiated in 1932 to form two Arab companies and one Kurdish company. 291. In April and May the levy detachments at Diana and Suleimania were withdrawn to Hinaidi, and the barracks at these places, with the exception ofcertain buildings retained by His Majesty’s Government in the l nited Kingdom, were handed over to the Iraqi Government. 292. By the end of 1933 the levy companies were distributed as follows : At Hinaidi, five Assyrian companies; at Shaibah, one Arab company; at Basra, one Arab company; and at Mosul, one Kurdish company. 293. Status in Iraq. —The negotiations with the Iraqi Government for satisfactory measures to legalise the continued existence, under air force control, i of a force of indigenous native troops, under the title “Air Defence Force, made no progress during the year. In July the Iraqi Government were informed that the responsibility for the failure to enact the necessary legislation rested exclusively upon them, and that, whilst the obligation remained unfulfilled, the levy force would necessarily remain, its status and discipline being covered by the existing law. 294. Assyrian Personnel of the Iraq Levies. —Despite the events of 1933, culminating in the exodus to Syria and the subsequent massacre, the Assyrian personnel of the levies behaved with exemplary restraint. This satisfactory attitude may, to some extent, be attributed to measures taken in January 1933, whereby every man in the levies was called upon to sign an undertaking to dissociate himself from all political movements in the future. Their retention in the levies, however, necessarily involves a serious risk in the event of further local trouble with the Assyrians. 295. Arrangements were made in August for a Royal Air Force Commission to investigate the condition of Assyrian levy families living in the disturbed areas, and for the evacuation from Kurdistan to Hinaidi of those who were found to be destitute. These measures also contributed greatly towards the maintenance by the Assyrians of so satisfactory an attitude during this trying period. The Iraqi Army. 296. The Iraqi army is organised mainly for internal defence, as at present the principal problems concern military measures in (a) the Kurdish mountains, {h) the middle reaches of the Euphrates and the Tigris, (c) against desert tribes. Until such time as all these areas are under complete administrative control, there is little prospect of successfully waging war against an invader. 297. The limited financial resources of the country have restricted the expansion of the army, although it has long been realised that further increase is necessary. In 1933 the army and defence estimates amounted to 884,260 Iraqi dinars. After considerable debate in Parliament, this was reduced to 826,670 dinars, to which was added approximately 20,000 dinars as extra expenditure in connexion with the Assyrian rebellion. Strength. 298. The total strength of the army and air force at the end of 1933 was 11,558 officers and men, and was composed of the following fighting units :— Two cavalry regiments. Two batteries of field artillery. Three batteries of mountain artillery. Twelve infantry battalions. One motor machine-gun company. One signal battalion. One section of armoured cars. Engineers’ platoon. Royal Iraqi Air Force. The administrative services consist of :— One mechanical transport company. Two horse transport companies. Veterinary and remount services. Ordnance services. Medical services.90^ 55 Organisation. 299. The military forces are controlled and administered by the Ministry of Defence. The Minister of Defence is responsible to the Government and is assisted by the Defence Council, of which he is president. The Defence Council ^ is composed of :— President: The Minister of Defence. Vice-Presidents: 1 st Military Member : The C.G.S. 2nd Military Member : The Q.M.G. 3rd Military Member : The Director of Provision and Supply. 4th Military Member : The G.S.O.I. 5th Military Member : The A.G. Additional members if required : Military members as may be required are selected by order of the Minister of Defence, but have no vote in the council. Secretary : The Secretary to the Ministry of Defence. (Has no vote in the council.) In addition, there is a headquarters staff organisation, modelled on the British divisional system, with modifications to suit local conditions. 300. The country is divided into three military districts, northern, eastern and southern, each under the command of an Amir-al-Liwa (Brigadier). ( 1 ) ~N or them District: Headquarters, Mosul. Troops in the district comprise— One cavalry regiment. Two mountain batteries. Four infantry battalions. One infantry depot. Ancillary services. ( 2 ) Eastern District: Headquarters, Kirkah. Troops in the district consist of— One mountain battery. Four infantry battalions. Ancillary services. (3) Southern District: Headquarters, Bagdad. Troops in the district consist of— Royal bodyguard. One cavalry regiment. Two field batteries. Engineer platoon. Four Iraqi infantry battalions. One signal battalion. Motor machine-gun company and section armoured cars. All ancillary services. 301. In addition, the following schools and depots are in the Southern district:— Staff School. Royal Iraq Military College. Cavalry School and Depot. Small Arms School. Mechanical Transport School and Depot. Ordnance Depot. /56 Training. 302. During the year the normal training programme was interrupted by operations in the north caused by the Assyrian rebellion. In consequence, the training throughout the army has not been so thorough or complete as in previous years. 303. Courses of instruction were carried out throughout the year, and the number of students trained was satisfactory; on the average, the standard attained was good. 304. Towards the end of 1933 courses for mechanical transport mechanics, which had hitherto been held by the Royal Air Force at Hinaidi, were held in the Iraqi Army Mechanical Transport School, with satisfactory results. 305. A Staff course for young officers was commenced, and will last two years. This is the first course at the Staff School for officers of the rank of subaltern. 306. Iraqi officers have been sent to England and India on technical and staff instructional courses. A rmaments. 307. The Iraqi army is equipped, in accordance with article 6 of the Treaty of Alliance, with arms and accoutrements similar to those used in the British army. The equipment of the cavalry consists of sabres and rifles. The artillery— Field artillery—4-5 howitzers and 18-pdr. Mk. II. Mountain artillery—2-75 gun and 3*7 howitzer. (In 1934 a second battery will be equipped with 3 • 7 howitzers.) There is a reserve of 18-pdr. guns and 6 -inch howitzers in the Ordnance Depot. The infantry— Equipped with British rifles, Lewis guns and Vickers machine guns. Armoured cars— Crossley six-wheelers. Bodies constructed locally in the ordnance workshops to suit local conditions and requirements. These have proved most satisfactory. Two more are being constructed in 1934 and will embody minor alterations and improvements. The motor machine-gun company is armed with Vickers machine guns, Lewis guns, rifles and revolvers. The Vickers guns can be fired either from the vehicle or the ground. Future Policy. 308. The policy of increasing the army received very considerable impetus after the Assyrian troubles. This opportunity was not neglected to obtain sanction for the much desired increases. Consequently, during the year 1934 units will be increased, where necessary, and additional units will be formed, the most impoitant of these being the formation of three frontier battalions for employment in the Kurdish mountains. These will be recruited chiefly from local Kurds. This will bring the number of battalions up to fifteen. A second 18-pdr. battery will be foimed, the engineer platoon will be increased to an engineer company, and a third infantry depot will be formed in the Eastern District at ' Kirkuk. In addition, ceitam administrative services will be increased and the signal service will be enlarged to meet the other additions. Operations. 309 - the yeai 1933 the battalion stationed in Suleimani were asked to assist the Persian forces in the suppression of rebel tribes This entailed moving most of the battalion into the Halabja area, where police and control duties were carried out with the intention of preventing the Persian rebels takino- refuge in Iraq. 8310. In the summer, owing to the Assyrian rebellion, a considerable number of troops had to be concentrated in the north, and training schools were disorganised. National Service Law. 311. As has long been realised, the greatest weakness in the defence forces ■of Iraq is the absence of a reserve. For years schemes have been discussed and considered with the aim of— (i) creating a reserve and/or (ii) introducing national service. Towards the end of 1933 a scheme was finally approved and placed before Parliament for the introduction of national service. This Bill was passed. Though it is not anticipated that the law will become operative for some years, the methods of its application and organisation are being considered from a military point of view and schemes for its successful initiation are under consideration. The British Military Mission. 312. During 1933 a large number of the British officers serving in the military mission completed their contracts with the Iraqi Government. In most cases the vacancies will be refilled. It was considered necessary, however, in view of the changed conditions resulting from the termination of the mandate, to alter in some cases the duties and nomenclature of the British advisers. In the main, however, they are the same as hitherto—purely advisory. It is intended to recruit three officers for employment with the infantry formations—one officer as an instructor at the Staff School—and to decrease the number of officers at headquarters. This minor adjustment, it is considered, will increase the efficiency of the army as a whole and improve the less efficient branches. Conclusion. 313. In conclusion, the year 1933 has shown that in spite of numerous difficulties, most of which were to be expected during the early stage of national independence, the prospects of the army and defence forces are, on the whole, satisfactory, and that the increasing number of officers who are gaining experience in command and staff duties, combined with the advisory staff, should considerably assist the attainment of a satisfactory standard of efficiency. The Royal Iraqi Air Force. 314. Since its inception in April 1931 the Royal Iraqi Air Force has increased with greater rapidity than any other branch of the Iraqi forces. 315. In April 1931 the air force consisted of five Gipsy Moths, one Puss Moth and a small ground staff, the Iraqi officers having qualified in England. Early in 1932 the establishment had grown to two flights of Gipsy Moths, each of three aircraft and a reserve, and one Puss Moth aircraft for communication purposes. In April of that year the first squadron was formed and consisted of three flights, each of four aircraft, two Gipsy Moth flights and one Puss Moth flio-ht. During the year fifty-six apprentices were under training in the various trades, so as to enable a second squadron and aircraft depot to be formed. 316. The British staff numbered three officers and five non-commissioned officers. This number is still employed with the Royal Iraqi Air Force. Increase to Two Squadrons in 1933. 317 In 1933 a second squadron was formed. It was equipped with eight De Havilland Dragons and the squadron of Gipsy Moths was reorganised as a flvins training school. This unit was to tram fifteen pupils m Iraq, and a British instructional staff of one officer and two non-commissioned officers was recruited, the officer filling the vacancy created by the termination of the contract of one of the officers mentioned above.58 318. In April 1933 the establishment was :— Headquarters. One squadron, comprising two flights, each of three D.H. Dragons, with a 33 per cent, reserve. One training squadron, comprising three flights, each of three Gipsy Moths, with a 33 per cent, reserve. (Be One communication flight of four Puss Moths. 319. In addition, workshops were established capable of complete engine and aircraft overhaul. 320. Aviation has been received with enthusiasm by the defence authorities and by the civil population, the interest of the latter being expressed by the formation of organisations for collecting money in each Liwa for the provision of aircraft. Training. 321. The training of the pupils in the instructional unit has proceeded most satisfactorily. Fifteen have been receiving instruction, and, with only one exception, have shown themselves apt and enthusiastic pupils. These cadets have put in a total of 373 flying hours. There have been the normal number of minoi accidents to school aircraft, which the workshop establishment have repaired 322. During the year forty-seven apprentices received instruction in the various trades, and it is proposed to instruct a further twenty-two in 1934. This instruction is now carried out by British non-commissioned officers loaned from the aircraft depot of the Royal Air Force, the instruction being given in the Iraqi Air Force depot workshops. Future Policy. 323. In accordance with the policy of increasing the defence forces, the Iraqi Government have ordered twelve Hawker Audax aircraft. Six of these are to be ready for delivery by the end of May 1934. 324. It is also proposed to form an armament section in 1934, and the necessary Lewis guns, Vickers guns and bombing sights have been ordered. 325. A complete photographic section will be formed, the necessary equip ment having been ordered for delivery in 1934. 326. Some of the new aircraft are to be equipped with the most up-to-date wiieless instiuments. Plans for the organisation of inter-communication within the Royal Iraqi Air Force and the army are well advanced, and a full training programme for 1934 has been compiled. ° Operations. 327. The Royal Iraqi Air Force took part in the operations against the Assynan lebels m the summer of 1933. The experience gained during the Barzan operations m the previous year was of considerable value. Normal co-operation with the ground forces was successfully carried out, in addition to reconnaissance over the disturbed area. Conclusion. 32S The spirit of national enthusiasm which manifested itself throughout the country after the successful operation of 1933 was no less marked in its effect on the air defence policy than on the army. The Royal Iraqi Air Force is rapidly increasing on most up-to-date lines, and the younger Iraqis are proving themselves skilled and enthusiastic aviators. &amp; u p g T ^ e estimated expenditure during the financial year 1933-34 is l raqi - 1 4 mars ’ while it is anticipated that the 1934-35 budget of 117,000 Iraqi dinars will meet with little opposition.zar) * c t 59 VII.—Mi s cell aneou s . International Agreements and Conventions. ^ ^ aw dated the 13th May, 1933, provided for the adhesion of Iraq to the International Convention for the Simplification of Customs Formalities and the protocol annexed thereto signed at Geneva on the 3rd December, 1923. 331. As a result of advice given by His Majesty’s Embassy, the Iraqi Government decided to amend Law No. 57 of 1932 concerning the accession ot Iraq to the Arms Traffic Convention of 1925 so as to include an undertaking to assume the additional obligations set out in articles 19-26 which anec countries possessing sea coasts. 332. A Bill enabling Iraq to accede to the International Convention of the 27th July, 1932, for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and bick in Armies in the Field and the Treatment of Prisoners of War, was accepte y the Council of Ministers and was laid before Parliament at the end or the yeai. 333. A law enabling Iraq to accede to the two protocols of the 27th October, 1922 and the 30th June, 1923, amending the International Convention ot the 13th October, 1919, for the Regulation of Air Navigation, was passed on the 30th March, 1933. 334. A law to enable the Iraqi Government to implement their obligations under the International Convention of the 13th July, 1931, for the Limitation of the Manufacture and Distribution of Narcotic Drugs was presented to Parliament in December 1933.0 335 . A law authorising the adhesion of Iraq to the Convention for the Establishment of an International Health Bureau passed its third reading m Parliament on the 26th December.( 2 ) 336. The Iraqi Government had not reached any decision at the end of the year in regard to their accession to the International Sanitary Convention for the Control of Aerial Navigation. They favoured a reservation similar to that made by His Majesty’s Government in the Commonwealth of Australia concerning the authenticity of vaccination and inoculation certificates. Correspondence on this subject with His Majesty’s Embassy and the Netherlands Government was proceeding at the end of the year. 337 In January the Iraqi Government considered the question of acceding to the International Navigable Waterways Convention. They decided, however, to defer their decision until the situation in the Shatt-al-Arab became cleaier. 338. Treaties with Foreign States signed and j or ratified 1933. Treaty. Signed. Ratified.

THE salient feature of the year was the admission of Iraq to membership of the League of Nations. During the first nine months the chief task was to complete the preparations for this event, and the main work of the last three was to introduce the modifications in Anglo-Iraqi relations which were necessitated by the changed circumstances which followed it. 2. From January to October Iraq was a territory under British mandate, relations between the two countries being governed by the treaties of 1922 and 1926. 3. On the 3rd October Iraq became an independent State member of the League of Nations; the treaties of 1922 and 1926 came to an end, and the Treaty of Alliance, concluded between Great Britain and Iraq on the 30th June, 1930, entered into force. The High Commission ceased to exist, and was replaced by a diplomatic mission, which, pending the arrival of His Majesty’s Ambassador in November, had the status of a Legation, with Sir Hubert Young as Minister Plenipotentiary. Sir Francis Humphrys arrived in Bagdad on the 8 th November and on the following day presented to King Faisal his credentials as His Majesty’s first Ambassador to the Kingdom of Iraq. 4. Other important events of the year were the operations against Sheikh Ahmad of Barzan in the spring and the strike of the Assyrian levies in June. 5. Iraq’s relations with her neighbours were marked by the conclusion of Extradition, “ Bon-Voisinage ” and Commercial Treaties with Turkey, King Faisal’s visit to His Imperial Majesty Riza Shah, and the visit of a League of Nations Commission to enquire into the question of the frontier between Syria and Iraq. 6 . In the sphere of administration, the year will be remembered for the introduction of a national currency, the imposition of a tax on agricultural produce (“ istihlak ” tax) at the place of sale in substitution for the age-old system of direct tithes, the grant of a concession to the British Oil Development Company to exploit oil in Iraq west of the Tigris, and the introduction of a comprehensive scheme of land settlement.[8744] b 2 II.— Foreign Relations. United Kingdom. 7. Up to the time of Iraq’s admission to membership of the League of Nations the relations of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom with Iraq were governed by the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1922, which had been accepted by the League of Nations as an effective interpretation of Great Britain’s mandatory responsibilities in Iraq. The manner in which relations between the two Governments were conducted under this treaty has already been fully described in the special report on Iraq for the period 1920-31, which was made to the Council of the League two years ago, and need not be further discussed here. 8 . With the entry of Iraq into the League of Nations on the 3rd October, 1932, the treaty of 1922 ceased to have effect, and the Treaty of Alliance concluded in June 1930 came into force. The chief task of the year, therefore, was to adjust relations to this change and to open negotiations with the Iraqi Government for the enactment of the several special measures required to give effect to the Treaty of Alliance. 9. The first change which became necessary was the conversion of the High Commission, by which His Majesty’s Government had been represented at Bagdad since 1920, into a diplomatic mission. In an exchange of notes appended to the Treaty of Alliance of 1930 the Iraqi Government had agreed that the diplomatic representative of His Majesty at the Court of the King of Iraq should have the status of Ambassador. Sir Francis Humphrys, who was appointed to be the first occupant of this post, was on duty at Geneva at the time of Iraq’s admission to the League of Nations, and, during the short interval between the 3rd October and the 8 th November, on which date he presented his credentials to King Faisal, the mission had the status of a Legation with Sir Hubert Young in charge as Minister Plenipotentiary. As a corollary to the change in status of the British representative in Iraq, it was necessary to modify the position of the British officials serving under the Iraqi Government. These had received on appointment a letter in which it was explained that, while they were the servants of the Iraqi Government, they would be called upon to keep the High Commissioner fully informed of the work of their departments. With the termination of the mandate, their responsibility towards the High Commissioner ceased, and the approval of King Faisal was obtained for this fact to be intimated to them in a further letter. The King and the Prime Minister agreed, however, that, in view of the special relations established under the Treaty of Alliance, the British advisers should continue to inform the Ambassador privately of all important developments. Another detail which remained to be settled was the composition of the disciplinary boards for British officials in the service of the Iraqi Government. 10 . Under the form of contract set out in the British Officials’ Agreement, which formed part of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1924, the High Commissioner had the right of nominating a representative on all disciplinary boards, and in certain other minor matters, also, a reference to the High Commissioner was provided for. Although the Ambassador was advised that in law a case could be made out for the substitution of the words “ His Britannic Majesty’s principal representative” for the words “High Commissioner” wherever they occurred in the contracts, it was not considered in the best interests of the officials themselves that this change should be pressed. It was felt to be more desirable that all references in the contracts to the High Commissioner should be deleted, and that a high British official in the Iraqi Government service should take the place of the High Commissioner’s representative on the Disciplinary Board. At the end of the year this proposal was under consideration, and steps were being taken to ascertain the views of the officials themselves. It was recognised that the consent of each individual official to the change was essential. 11 . As regards the implementing of the treaty of 1930, the principal questions which had to be dealt with were the creation of special guards for the protection of the air bases occupied under the treaty by British forces, the setting up of a Railway Corporation to take over the Iraq Railways, the establishment of4 a Port Trust, the formation of a British Advisory Military Mission, and the selection of the air bases provided for in article 5 of the treaty. J he action which has been taken in regard to these matters is described seriatim below. The Aerodrome Guards. 12 . Article 4 of the treaty of 1930 embodies an undertaking by the King A of Iraq to provide, upon agreed conditions, special guards from his own forces W * for the protection of the air bases, which under the treaty, may be occupied by British forces. Agreement as to the conditions under which these forces should be made available was reached during the negotiations for the conclusion of the treaty itself, and are contained in a secret letter, dated the 30th June, 1930, written to Sir Francis Humphrys by Nuri Pasha, but not published with the treaty. 13. Preliminary discussions with the Iraqi Government concerning the formation of this force were opened early in 1932, and it was agreed that it should be given the title of “ The Air Defence Force.” 14. Further progress was for several months hindered by the Barzan opera tions and the strike of the Assyrian levies which followed, but by the beginning of August it was found possible to communicate to the Prime Minister a draft law for the creation of the Air Defence Force, which, it was intended, should serve as a basis for detailed discussion. 15. It was desired to make it possible to convert the levy force into the Air Defence Force simultaneously with Iraq’s entry into the League of Nations. For this reason the draft was prepared in the form of an ordinance so that it could be brought into force without passage through Parliament, which was not then sitting. 16. From the beginning of the discussions which followed, the Prime Minister maintained the view that legislation was not necessary and that full effect could be given to the requirements of the treaty, and of his secret letter by means of Army Orders issued by the Ministry of Defence. The adviser to the Ministry of Justice and the legal secretary at the Residency, however, held the view that the force could not be established on a satisfactory basis except by law. The Ministry of Justice, when asked for an official ruling, replied with an opinion of oracular vagueness the precise sense of which has never been determined, and this essential issue had not been settled when the year closed. Side by side with the discussion of the question of the form of instrument needed to create the Air Defence Force, informal conversations were carried on regarding the specific provisions which it was necessary that this instrument, whether law or Army Order, should cover. Here, too, many difficulties and differences were encountered and little real progress had been made by the end of the year. The Railway Corporation. 17. The provisions of the treaty of 1930 in regard to the future of the Iraq Railways are contained in paragraph 4 of Sir Francis Humphrys’s letter of the 19th August to Nuri Pasha, which constitutes the financial appendix to the treaty. 18. In March 1932 a tentative draft law to give effect to these provisions was sent to the Iraqi Government. About two months later a memorandum was received from the secretary to the Council of Ministers, which contained some observations on the draft and informed the High Commissioner of the desire of the Iraqi Government to put the necessary legislation through Parliament during the session of 1932. Replies to these observations were communicated to the Government a few days later, and the High Commissioner concurred in the Government’s view that it was desirable that the law should be passed as soon as possible. Nevertheless, the Government failed to submit the proposed legisla tion to the Chamber before the close of the parliamentary session of 1932. 19. When His Majesty’s Ambassador returned to Bagdad in the autumn he ] again took up the matter with the Iraqi Government, but owing to the resignation 1 of Nuri Pasha’s Government and the preoccupation of the new Cabinet with the i general elections, it was found impossible to reopen active discussions before the I end of the year.5 [8744] B 3 Air Bases. 20. The treaty and its annexures contemplate that the Royal Air Force will be retained at Hinaidi for a period not exceeding five years after the entry into force of the treaty. By the expiration of that period, Hinaidi is to be evacuated in favour of an air base at a site to be selected to the west of the Euphrates. The cantonment at Hinaidi is to be taken over at an agreed valuation by the Iraqi Government. The Iraqi Government have undertaken to make the selected site for the air base available. After careful examination of a number of areas on the west side of the Euphrates, His Majesty’s Government eventually decided to take up land at Dhibban bend, a site which is bounded on two sides by the River Euphrates, on the south by the Habbaniyah plateau, and on the west by the line of the proposed Habbaniyah Escape Channel. An official application was made to the Iraqi Government for the acquisition of this area and for steps to be taken to prevent alienation of or speculation in the land, and the carrying out of any new work in the area for which compensation could be demanded when the site was taken over. The Iraqi Government took prompt action to comply with this request and stated that the whole of the land required was Government land for which no rental would be demanded. Arrangements have been made for the Royal Air Force to take over the land for preliminary work on the 1 st July, 1933, and a Compensation Committee comprising representatives of the Iraqi Government and the Royal Air Force has been set up to assess the amounts to be paid to the comparatively few cultivators and others who will be evicted from the site. These people are being allotted fresh land in an adjacent district by the Iraqi Government. The Port Trust. 21 . A draft law for the setting up of a port trust has been prepared, but consideration thereof has been deferred until a decision has been taken upon the proposal to institute a conservancy board to control the navigation and administration of the Shatt-al-Arab, which, if formed, would assume the powers over these waters now vested in the Port Director and would considerably reduce the responsibilities of the port authorities of Basra. No decision had been reached by the end of the year. The Military Mission. 22. Letter No. IV attached to the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930 stated that it was the intention of the Iraqi Government to ask for a British Advisory Military Mission, the numbers of which should be decided before the treaty came into force and the conditions of service of which should be similar to those of the existing military mission. In conformity with this undertaking negotiations took place between the two Governments, and the agreement reached was embodied in a letter from the Prime Minister, dated the 2nd August, informing the High Commissioner that the number of British officers comprising the mission would be eleven, and that three officers and five non-commissioned officers would be employed in addition for service with the Iraqi Air Force. The designations of the officers were left to be settled by agreement between the Minister of Defence and the head of the mission. The Iraqi Government proposed to reconsider the composition of the cadre once every three years. This letter was formally acknowledged and agreement was subsequently reached between the Minister of Defence and the head of the mission, and endorsed by His Majesty’s Government, upon the grades and designations of the appointments. The mission was maintained at the agreed strength up to the end of the year. The League of Nations. 23. At their 66 th session held in January 1932 the Council of the League of Nations considered the report of the Permanent Mandates Commission, prepared in the previous November, on the subject of the fitness of Iraq for membership of the League. The Council found that Iraq fulfilled the conditions which had been laid down in September 1931 for her emancipation from the mandatory regime, and declared themselves prepared in principle to pronounce the termination of that regime with effect from the date of Iraq’s admission to the League of Nations, provided that adequate undertakings were given to the Council regarding the protection of minorities and of foreign interests in Iraq4 6 Thp task of DreDarine these undertakings was entrusted to an ad Aoc committee of the Coldl whosf draft was adopted at their 67th sessron in May They were then embodied in a declaration which was signed and ratified by the Iraq, Government and deposited with the Secretary-General. 24. At the 68 th session in September 1932 the Council took note of this and thereby left the way clear for Iraq’s admission to membership of the League of Nations^* Meanwhile, in a letter dated the 12th July, the Iraqi Govern- ment had requested the Secretary-General of the League to place their application for membership on the agenda of the September session of the Assembly. Simultaneously they submitted a memorandum pointing out that Iraq was a signatory to the Pact of Paris, and pledging that the Government woul d as soon as^possible” accede to the convention of the 17th June, 192o, relating to the supervision of the international trade in arms and munitions of war The question came before the Assembly on the 3rd October and Iraq was that day unanimously elected to membership of the League. 25 A League of Nations Commission of Enquiry into Traffic in Women and Children in the East arrived in Bagdad on the 9th February and remained fnr n fortnight visiting the chief provincial centres. The Permanent Mandates Commission. 26 The annual report on Iraq for the year 1931 made by His Majesty’s Government to the Council of the League was considered by the 1 ermanent Mandates Commission at their 22nd session in November 1932. 27 Having regard to the fact that the mandate had already terminated, the conimission°refrained from submitting any detailed observations thereon to the Council. Capitulations. 28 The resolution adopted by the Council at their 67th Session approving of the undertakings to be given by the Iraqi Government, to which reference has been made above, also contained a recommendation that the Powers, members of the League, whose nationals had enjoyed capitulatory rights in the former Ottoman Empire, should renounce the maintenance in Iraq of those rights before the admission of Iraq to the League. The Powers concerned were Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Holland, Norway, Portugal, Boumania, Spain, Sweden and Persia. To each of these both His Majesty s Government and the Secretary-General of the League of Nations addressed a note inviting attention to the resolution and to the declaration made by the Iraqi Government regarding the maintenance of the special judicial regime that had been set up, and expressing the hope that they would be willing to act in accordance with the recommendation of the Council. In each instance a favourable reply was received, and when the time came for Iraq to apply for admission to the League she could do so freed from the invidious juridical commitments which she had inherited from the Ottoman Empire. 29. The United States of America also formerly enjoyed capitulatory rights in the old Ottoman Empire, but not being members of the League were not included in the list of States addressed. The United States occupy a special position in regard to Capitulations. Prior to the signature of the Tripartite Convention between the United States of America, Great Britain and Iraq on the 9 th January, 1930, the United States of America claimed, in principle, the maintenance of pre-war capitulatory rights. That instrument, however, secured for United States citizens the benefits pertaining to nationals of States members of the League of Nations, under the Anglo-Iraq treaties of 1924-26 and their subsidiary agreements. These agreements included the Anglo-Iraqi Judicial Agreement of 1924, which secured certain judicial privileges for “ foreigners in Iraq, who were subjects of former capitulatory Powers that had not renounced their rights. For the period of the agreement these privileges were substituted for the former capitulatory rights. The United States of America, by the Tripartite Convention, accepted this position in effect. The Judicial Agreement of 1924 was replaced in May 1931 by a new Judicial Agreement by which special privileges for certain classes of foreigners were abrogated in favour of a uniform system of justice for all, based upon the presence of a number of British legalexperts in the Iraqi judiciary for a term of ten years. In accordance with article 6 of the Tripartite Convention, this agreement was submitted to, and accepted by, the United States Government in June 1931. It lapsed on the entry of Iraq into the League, and the Iraqi Government have guaranteed to the League that the judicial regime instituted by that agreement will be maintained without f change for a period of ten years. It was no doubt on account of this guarantee that the ex-capitulatory Powers felt able to accept the recommendation of the Council and to renounce their rights. The United States Government, however, by reason of their position outside the League, have made no specific renunciation. In an aide-memoire dated the 8 th July, 1932, however, the United States Embassy in London stated that the United States Government were satisfied that the assurances given by Iraq to the League would afford adequate protection to legitimate American interests in Iraq on the termination of the mandatory regime. Under article 7 of the Tripartite Convention, the United States now enjoy in Iraq most-favoured-nation treatment, pending the conclusion of a treaty governing the future relations between the two countries. Though, therefore, no specific renunciation of capitulatory rights has been made by the United States, it would appear that they cannot claim treatment in judicial matters more favourable than that accorded to the subjects of other States. A fghanistan. 30. On the 25th December, 1932, the Iraqi Minister and the Afghan Ambassador at Tehran signed, on behalf of their Governments, a treaty of friendship between the two countries. It provided inter alia for mutual recognition and for the exchange of diplomatic and consular representatives. 31. An exchange of notes was appended to this treaty expressly recognising the special position of His Majesty’s Ambassador in Iraq, as laid down in the annexes to the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance of 1930. France. 32. On the 10 th October a protocol was signed at Geneva between the Governments of the United Kingdom, France and Iraq, in which it was agreed that the rights and obligations devolving upon the Government of the United Kingdom under the San Remo Oil Agreement of the 24th April, 1920, and the convention signed at Paris on the 23rd December, 1920, relating to certain points connected with the mandates for Syria and the Lebanon, Palestine and Mesopotamia should be transferred to the Iraqi Government in so far as the provisions of these instruments related to Iraq. At the same time a note was addressed to the French Government informing them that it was the intention of the Government of the United Kingdom to use their good offices for the purpose of ensuring the proper execution of the aforesaid provisions. 33. Details of the arrangements made with the French Government for the final delimitation of the Syrio-Iraq frontier are given in the section dealing with relations with Syria. Italy. 34. Cavaliere Guglielmo Rulli held the post of Italian Charge d’Affaires until the 26th October, when he was relieved by Cavaliere Mario Porta. The former won considerable personal popularity with King Faisal and flattered him by presenting him with a handsomely framed portrait of Signor Mussolini, a personal gift from the Duce himself. 35. The Iraqi Government had hoped that his successor would be given the rank of Minister, and Cavaliere Porta received a somewhat cold welcome when it was known that he was to be only a Charge d’Affaires. Koweit. 36. His Excellency Sheikh Ahmad-al-Jabir-al-Sabah, Ruler of Koweit, arrived in Bagdad on the 3rd September on a three days’ private visit to King Faisal. During his stay he was the guest of the King at His Majesty’s country house at Harthiyah. [8744] * b 48 The Koweit Frontier. 37. The frontier between Iraq and Koweit was originally fixed in a letter from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Sheikh of Koweit in 1923. It was considered desirable, however, that it should be reaffirmed in a formal manner by instruments suitable for production, if necessary, in connexion with Iraq’s application for admission to the League of Nations. I he Iraqi Prime Minister $ accordingly requested the High Commissioner in July to obtain the agreement of the sheikh to the following description of the existing frontier between the two countries :— c&lt; From the intersection of the Wadi-al-Audja with the Batin and thence northward along the Batin to a point just south of the latitude of Safnan; thence eastwards passing south of Safnan Wells, Jebel Sanam and Um Qasr leaving them to Iraq, and so on to the junction of the Khor Zobeir with the Khor Abdullah. The islands of Warlah, Babiyan, Maskan (or Maslijan), Failakah, Auhah Kubbar, Qaru and Umm-el-Maradin appertaining to Koweit.” Through the same channel the sheikh conveyed his consent. Properties of the Sheikh of Koiveit in Iraq. 38. On the 3rd November, 1914, His Majesty’s consul-general in the Persian Gulf wrote a letter to the then Ruler of Koweit and its Dependencies, promising, in return for specified assistance in the prosecution of the war, that his date gardens in Iraq should remain in his possession and the possession of his descendants without being subject to the payment of revenue or taxes. In fulfilment of this promise, no land revenue was charged against the sheikh in respect of these properties during the period of the British military occupation. The promise of His Majesty’s Government was honoured, and immunity was conceded, by the Iraqi Government, although with annually increasing reluctance, until the year 1932, when the system of land revenue underwent a radical change. Until then, taxation on date gardens had been assessed on the basis of their area and the number of the trees. The revision in method, which applied to all forms of agricultural produce, abolished assessment upon area and substituted therefor a 10 per cent, tax on all produce brought to market or exported. Produce consumed by the owners or cultivators, or which did not become merchandise, was not subject to taxation. The revised method was made applicable to the date crop of the year 1932, and, as the law ordering the change of system contained no provision for the immunity of produce owned by the Sheikh of Koweit from the new taxation, the Iraqi Government refused to exempt the marketed or exported produce of his gardens. The sheikh protested against this on the grounds that his promised immunity from land revenue taxation was thereby violated. His Majesty’s representative made an official request that the appli cation of the new system should be postponed so far as the property of the sheikh was concerned, but no reply was received to the request. The wording of the promise can be held to apply solely to taxes on the gardens, and not to taxes taken on the sale or export of the produce of the gardens. It would, in practice, be exceedingly difficult to devise machinery to secure the exclusion from taxation of dates grown in the sheikh’s gardens after the crop had been picked and moved. J he position at the end of the year, therefore, was that the taxation was being applied to the produce of the gardens of the sheikh, and the question of compen sating him was still under consideration. The same problem exists in connexion with the gardens of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, who was given a similar promise at the same time. No protest has, however, been received from him or his agents against the application of the revised form of taxation to produce from his gardens. 39. Another matter arising out of the promise given to the Sheikh of Koweit assumed prominence during the year, when a case was filed against him, by one of the heirs of the previous owner, in the Iraqi Law Courts contesting the validity of his title to a portion of one of the larger estates. This particular piece of land was purchased by the sheikh’s ancestor in 1909, and had been m the possession of the family since then. The courts held that, as the piece olland in question had not been registered in Tapu, the official land registry, the sheikh’s title to it was not good and, accordingly, found in favour of the claimant. It is unfortunate that the non-registration of the land in the official land registry was due to the fact that the Turkish Government would not allow it to be registered until the sheikh admitted that he was an Ottoman subject. The sheikh, on the advice of the then British consul, refused to make this admission, and the entry in the registers was, therefore, never completed. The case was taken to the final Court of Appeal, and the decision dispossessing the sheikh was upheld. Encouraged by the successful outcome of this test case, the remaining co-heirs have filed similar suits, and there is but little doubt that a similar decision will be given. The sheikh protested against this as a further breach of the promise of His Majesty’s Government, but not until after the legal processes had been completed, when it was too late for any effective action to be taken even had it been possible. The piece of land in question is not large and its loss, although distinctly unfortunate, might not have become a matter of grave importance, had it not been that the case drew the attention of interested lawyers to the sheikh’s landholdings, with the result that the descendants of one of the vendors of a large estate, which was purchased by the sheikh’s ancestor in 1908, have filed a suit claiming that this property also is illegally held by the sheikh. The property is a valuable one, and it is doubtful whether in law the sheikh has a valid title to it. For the reasons already explained, it was not registered in his name in the official land registry up to the outbreak of war. In order to rectify this, the Revenue Commissioner of the Civil Administration gave him in 1915 a Tapu title- deed covering it. The suit which is now being brought contests this title-deed on the ground that certain formalities were not complied with before it was issued and that it is, therefore, invalid. It is possible that this is so, and that the suit for dispossession might succeed. The methods open to His Majesty’s Government for protecting the sheikh’s interests were receiving consideration at the end of the year. Post and Telegraph Services in Koweit. 40. The Post and Telegraph Services in Koweit were administered by the British forces during the war and were subsequently placed under the control of the appropriate Department of the Iraqi Government, by whom they are still operated. During recent years the Sheikh of Koweit has been inclined to raise objections to this arrangement, and various difficulties have arisen. In September 1932, following upon the visit of the Sheikh of Koweit to Bagdad, the Iraqi Government enquired whether His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to negotiate an agreement between Iraq and Koweit regarding posts, telegraphs and telephones. They pointed out that, in the interests of efficiency, it was necessary to regularise procedure; and they proposed to undertake these services in Koweit for a period of twenty years under a formal agreement. The proposal was duly communicated by His Majesty’s Government to the Sheikh of Koweit, who intimated that he was prepared to enter into such an agreement subject to certain conditions. These conditions were not entirely palatable to the Iraqi authorities and by the end of the year no further progress had been made. Smuggling from Koweit. 41. Contraband traffic from Koweit territory into Iraq has for long been a thorn in the flesh of the Iraqi Customs authorities. The volume of contraband entering Iraq in this way is reported by the Customs authorities to be large, and several affrays with armed smugglers, in which casualties have been sustained by preventive officers, have occurred. During the year the Customs authorities tightened up their control of traffic between Koweit and Iraq by land and by river. Amongst other measures they ordered the boats, which were accustomed to put out from Koweit to fetch sweet water from the Shatt-al-Arab, to report to the customs post at Fao on entering Iraqi territory. This caused some incon venience to the boatmen, delay in the supply of water to Koweit and drew a protest from the Sheikh of Koweit. The Iraqi Government regretted that they could not relax the restrictions unless the sheikh could guarantee that the boats would not engage in smuggling. The co-operation of the sheikh in preventive measures against smuggling has been invited.Persia. 42 The .accord provisoire regulating Iraqi-Persian relations which was originally concluded in August 1929 was, by mutual agreement between the Two Governments, extended during the year. wo Jafar Sultan. 43.

In such circumstances Jafar Sultan could not maintain himself for long in the mountains and on the 9th January he surrendered to the Mutessarif of Sulaimani- an undertaking having first been given to him that he would not be handed over to the Persians Shortly afterwards he was sent to Mosul, where he remained for Mn t eS f v t i‘ e „ year ’ llvl ?S on a sma11 allowance from the Iraqi Government Most of his followers and several of his sons, however, still remained at lars-e’ They scattered along the frontier, moving constantly from place to nlace sometimes in Persia, sometimes in Iraq, successfully eluding the Iraqi authorW Everything possible was done to discourage them from staying in Iraq and to force them to surrender to the Persians on whatever terms they couM obtain 1^1 P a Gov , ern - me were ’ howev er&gt; by no means satisfied with these measures, and early in January the Persian Minister in Bagdad addressed a strongly-worded note to the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs Iccusin? the Trent Kti; J' S''KStf 0°—'« dissatisfaction note to'the Irtof MiniXf/f' ‘p Persia n Minister in Bagdad addressed a further Gtc t° tne Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, in which he made charges ao-airmt Iraqi officials and imous-ned thp o-nnH fnim ^ t • cnarges against unjustifiable mannen g g h ° f the Imqi Gov e^ment m a quite officials hM° Iwif e D n p^v W l^ a ^ eV ^ r f- WaS P r ove his allegations that Iraqi C only on thp y assist ! n g, the Auromam rebels, and these were clearly Actino- on the advipp nf tlf 1 an ^ P nwari,a nted a 'posteriori reasoning.

Four Iraqis were11 killed and twenty-four wounded on this occasion. The Iraqi Government protested and claimed 20,000 rupees as compensation for the victims. The Persian Government replied offering a half-hearted apology for the mistake, but meeting the claim for compensation with a counter-claim of 100,000 rupees for nineteen Persian soldiers killed in a skirmish in November 1931, in which it was 9 alleged a large number of Iraqi tribesmen had taken part. The Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs were provided with arguments with which to counter this claim, and were advised to press for compensation for the Tawila victims, , although possibly reducing the sum claimed. This advice was given in June, and it is not known what, if any, further action the Iraqi Government took in the matter. The Jaf. | 49. In order to avoid a repetition of the deadlock which had occurred in 1931 when the Persian Government endeavoured to put an absolute embargo on the annual migration of the Jaf tribe into Persia, the Iraqi Government wisely opened early negotiations with the Persian Government with a view to make better arrangements for the migration in 1932. The Iraqi Minister in Tehran took up the question vigorously with the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs early in the year, but, although he succeeded in persuading them to modify their previous intransigence, agreement was not reached until after a meeting in June between the Iraqi Mudir of Penjwin and the Persian Officer Commanding Troops at Banah, whereat it was arranged that the migration should be permitted on the following conditions :— ( 1 ) That each of the major sections of the tribe should send a representative to remain at Banah while the Jaf were in Persia. ( 2 ) That Persian permits would be given to all those who had arms permits in Iraq. (3) That the Iraqi Koda tax figures would be accepted for the taxation of sheep and goats at the rate of 1 kran per head. (4) That a small tax should also be collected on horses and cattle. The Jaf accepted these terms and seem to have been well treated in Persia. They returned to Iraq in the autumn without becoming involved in any serious trouble. The High Commissioner's Visit to Tehran. 50. On several occasions since his arrival in Bagdad as High Commissioner in the early winter of 1930 Sir Francis Humphrys had received hints from the Persian Minister that the Shah and Teymourtache would like him to pay a visit to Tehran for an informal discussion of Perso-Iraqi relations. The proposal had been considered in May 1931, but Sir Robert Clive considered the atmosphere at that time to be unfavourable. At the beginning of the year under review, however, the situation had considerably improved, and the Minister of Court, in the course of preliminary conversations with His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran on the subject of Persian desiderata in the Shatt-al-Arab, renewed the invitation to Sir Francis to visit Tehran. It was considered that such a visit would afford a good opportunity for an informal discussion of the principal provisions of the tripartite Shatt-al-Arab Convention which it was hoped to conclude between Iraq, Persia and the United Kingdom before the admission of Iraq to membership of the League of Nations. The invitation was accordingly accepted and the High Commissioner arrived in Tehran on the 4th April. 51. The frontier between Iraq and Persia as determined by the Treaty of Erzerum of 1847 (between Persia and the Ottoman Empire) and the Four-Power Protocol of 1913 follows, in the Shatt-al-Arab sector, the left bank of the waterway (except at Mohammerah, where the anchorage is in Persian water), thereby leaving the whole of the channel under Iraqi sovereignty. Although freedom of navigation in the Shatt-al-Arab is assured to Persian ships under the Treaty of Erzerum, it has in recent years become a grievance of the Persian Government that ships can only reach the Persian ports of Abadan and Mohammerah by passing through Iraqi territory. Their view is that the present frontier line should be rectified to follow the median line of the waterway. Theca mtm 12 matter was raised at the time of the Persian Government’s recognition of Iraq in March 1929, when the Persian Government obtained an assurance from His Majesty’s Government that, recognising the practical difficulties arising from the present frontier in the Shatt-al-Arab, they would lend their good offices to assist Persia to obtain such reasonable demands as she might put forward. The Persian Government did not, in fact, put forward any demands, but they $ continued to nurse their grievance and frequently to voice it informally, though refraining from any official demarche. 52. It was realised, however, that a settlement was essential if Perso-Iraqi relations were to be established on a durable basis and with thm end in view the conservancy board scheme was evolved. This envisaged the conclusion of a tripartite agreement between Persia, Iraq and the United Kingdom for the establishment of a board, on which each Government would be represented, to control and improve the navigation in the Shatt-al-Arab in the common interest of all three parties. 53. In his discussions with the Persian Minister of the Court and the Minister for Foreign Affairs the High Commissioner was able to persuade them to agree in principle to Persian participation in the proposed conservancy board. They also agreed that negotiations for the conclusion of a tripartite treaty setting up the board should be opened in Bagdad early in the summer. A copy of a provisional draft treaty was left privately with Teymourtache for him to study personally. 54. Another important frontier question which was broached by Teymour tache was that of the rectification of the boundary line in the transferred terri tories in the Naft Khana area, where he claimed that the existing line was harmful to Persian interests as it cut through the middle of the oil-field. He did not press the matter, but the High Commissioner took the opportunity to suggest that the best solution would be to develop the oil-field as a single unit and to assign an agreed proportion of the royalties to each Government. King Faisal’s Visit to Tehran. 55. Soon after the High Commissioner’s return to Bagdad, King Faisal paid an official visit to the Shah. His Majesty left Bagdad on the 22nd April, accom panied by the Prime Minister, Nuri Pasha, and arrived in Tehran on the 26th April. He was cordially welcomed by the Shah, who placed the Gulistan Palace at his disposal. On the 1 st May, King Ffcisal left Tehran for Basra by way of Mohammerah. 56. Both King Faisal and Nuri Pasha informed the High Commissioner that in conversations with the Shah and with the Persian Ministers they were able, without great difficulty, to obtain a reaffirmation of the agreement in principle to the Shatt-al-Arab Conservancy Board scheme which had previously been given to the High Commissioner. They also found that the suggestion made by the High Commissioner for the unification of the Naft Khana Oil-field was receiving favourable consideration. In addition they were able to pave the way for the negotiation of treaties concerning the control of frontier tribes residence and extradition. 57. The King brought back with him a deep impression of the Shah’s auto cratic power which has ever since tended to tempt him to experiments in emulation. Subsequent Developments. 58. Following the King’s return, the Iraqi Government communicated to the 1 ersian Government draft treaties concerning Residence and “ Bon-Voisinao-e ” the Regulation of Frontier Relations and Extradition, and invited the Persian Government to open formal negotiations for the conclusion of treaties on the basis of these drafts. It was also hoped, according to plan, to enter into final negotiations regarding the conservancy board as soon as Sir Francis Humphrvs returned from the May session of the Council of the League of Nations In the event, however this did not prove practicable. The Iraqi Cabinet, exhausted bv an exceptionally long and busy parliamentary session, were, when the time came13 completely worn out and in no mood to undertake protracted negotiations in agdad in the intense heat of June. In these circumstances the Persian Govern ment were asked to postpone negotiations until the autumn and somewhat reluctantly agreed. ^ -p P®- Towards the end of October the Persian Minister at Bagdad, Mirza Imqir Kazemi visited Tehran and on his return he informed the Iraqi Minister tor Ipreign Anairs that he had been given full authority to negotiate on all out- standmg matters and emphasised the Persian Government’s desire to obtain a rectification of the frontier in the Shatt-al-Arab. The Persian Minister for loreign Affairs, who arrived in Bagdad a few days later on his way home from Geneva, also made references, in conversation with King Faisal and the Ambassador, to the claim of the Persian Government to half of the waters of the fehatt-al-Arab, a claim which, he urged, was fully justified by the principles of international equity. ^ ^ r ?^ ese conv Gfsations, though quite informal, seemed to indicate that the Persian Government intended to go back on the provisional undertaking arrived at m Tehran earlier in the year. The King became alarmed and instructed the Minister for Foreign Affairs that in negotiating with Kazemi he should endeavour to open with less controversial issues and to reserve the Shatt-al-Arab question to a later date. 61. In early December the Persian Minister communicated to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, as a basis for discussion, five draft treaties which the Persian Government wished to conclude with the Iraqi Government. These were a Treaty of Friendship, a Treaty of Neutrality, a Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, a Residence Treaty, and an Extradition Treaty. The Minister for Foreign Affairs sent copies of these drafts to the Embassy and they were under examination at the end of the year. The Frontier. 62. The Persian Government have, up to the present, deliberately avoided formally recognising as the frontier between Persia and Iraq the line demarcated by the Delimitation Commission in 1914. Except in a letter from the Persian Minister to the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs in October 1931, the validity of this line has not been deliberately challenged in writing by a responsible representative of the Government, but the Minister of the Court,’in conversation with the British Minister at Tehran, and Persian frontier officials, when discussing, both orally and in writing, matters of common interest with Iraqi frontier officials, have frequently implied that the 1914 demarcation was not now binding on the Persian Government. The intention, no doubt, is to endeavour to keep the question open in the hope thereby of obtaining adjustments of the line or compensatory concessions in Persia’s favour, both in the Shatt-al-Arab and in the transferred territories oil-fields. 63. The uncertainty of the position in regard to the frontier leads, however, to much friction and difficulty in day-to-day relations between the two countries, since it leaves the Iraqi Government without any firm ground on which to base representations to the Persian Government concerning the many violations of Iraqi frontier rights which are perpetrated by the local Persian officials. Some of the more important outstanding questions of this kind are set out in the following paragraphs. Baijaliya Post. 64. In the late summer of 1931 the Mutessarif of the Amara liwa reported that the Persians had built a gendarmerie post within the Iraqi frontier at Baijaliya. This was not, however, accurately located until April 1932, when, at the request of the Iraqi Government, Royal Air Force aircraft flew over the area and succeeded in photographing it. The results showed convincingly that a solid masonry post of considerable size had been constructed approximately 1 kilom. from the frontier within Iraqi territory on the southern slopes of the Jabal Hamrin to the east of Ali Gharbi.65. The Persian gendarmes reported to their headquarters the flight of the aircraft over their post, and the Persian Government protested against what they claimed to be a “ violation of the Persian air.” The Iraqi Government retorted by asking the Persian Government to remove their post from Iraqi territory. This was the position in July 1932, since when His Majesty’s representative has received no information as to what further action has been taken in the matter. ^ The Sharis Lands. 66 . Not far south of the Baijaliya post and in the neighbourhood of frontier pillar XIX lie the Sharis lands. In the autumn of 1931 the Persian Governor of Khuzistan installed Persian tribesmen in these lands. It so happens that the Iraqi Bani Lam tribe customarily graze their flocks in the Sharis lands, and the Mutessarif of Amara therefore addressed a remonstrance to the Governor of Khuzistan on the subject of the Persian intrusion. The Governor responded with a categorical claim to Persian sovereignty over this territory and established a temporary gendarmerie post in support of the intruders. In January 1932 the Iraqi Government took up the matter with the Persian Government and proposed a joint enquiry to determine the position of the Sharis lands in relation to the frontier. The Persian Government ignored the request for a joint enquiry, and after the exchange of several notes with the Iraqi Legation in Tehran, the Persian Minister in Bagdad informed the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs in March that there was no doubt that the Sharis lands belonged to Persia. The Iraqi Minister in Tehran also reported that he had discussed the matter with the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, who had suggested that as the question of the frontier had not yet been formally settled, it would be better to postpone further discussions on this point until agreement had been reached on the major issue of the alignment of the frontier itself. In April the local Iraqi liwa authorities reported that the Persians were collecting material to build a permanent post to replace the temporary structure which had originally housed the gendarmes. No subsequent information has been received from the Iraqi Government about this question. hiai Khidir Post. 67. In June the Mutessarif of the Diyala liwa found that a Persian post had been constructed at Nai Khidir between boundary pillars XXXV and XXXVI in a situation which, in his opinion, was undoubtedly in Iraqi territory, although the Persian gendarmes in occupation stoutly maintained that it was in Persia. So far as is known the Iraqi Government had not, up to the close of the year, made any formal protest to the Persian Government regarding this post. Kachcd Kachal Post. 68 . The Persian Government for their part have represented that the Iraqi Police and Customs Post at Kachal Kachal on the frontier near Khaniqin is partly built on Persian territory. In doing so, however, they were careful to avoid any reference to the delimitation of 1914. The Iraqi Government have investigated the matter and have found that possibly a small part of the building may overlap the border line. 69. The policy of the Iraqi Government in regard to these frontier questions is to press the Persians to agree to an enquiry into each case by a mixed commission assisted by technical experts and surveyors. The Mandali Water. 70. Mandali, in the Diyala liwa, is dependent for water for its extensive fruit gardens on the Gangir stream. Saumar, on the Persian side of the frontier, is in a similar position. The Frontier Commission of 1914 ruled that the water should be shared equally between Mandali and Saumar, but after about seven years’ negotiations with the Persian Government, the question of how this is to be done still remains unsolved, and during the year under report Mandali suffered from serious shortage of water. ]\o new representations were made to the Persian Government, but the Iraqi Government in July voted 2,000 Iraqi dinars for experimental well-boring in the vicinity of the town.2 J 15 The Zurbatiya Water. The Delimitation Commission of 1914 fixed the frontier between pi iars XXXII and XXXI on the median line of the Gunjan Cham River. The ownsmp ol Zurbatiya and the lands east of it receive their water by canals from the nght banh of the river which take off between these two pillars. In March IJdl the Persian Governor of Mansurabad constructed a dam across the Gunjam Cham within the sector in which the frontier follows the median line and so usurped control of the whole of the water. Zurbatiya suffered seriously during the summer. Correspondence with the Persian Legation produced no results, and the Persian Government refused to agree to a joint investigation of water rights. In hebruary 1932 the Governor of Mansurabad began work on a second new canal which would still further diminish the already meagre supply of water reaching Zurbatiya. The usual representations were made without avail, and according to information received in August the people of Zurbatiya were suffering from a grave shortage of water owing to the action taken by the Persian Governor. Other Water Difficulties. 72. Similar difficulties in the distribution of frontier streams have arisen in the neighbourhood of Panjwin, Biyara and at several other points on the frontier in the Halabja district. Since the Persian occupation of the Auroman country on the opposite side of the border, the officials appear to do their utmost to create friction between the Persian and Iraqi villages on the frontier. In most instances, the Iraqi officials are more pacific and less arrogant than the Persians, and in consequence, in this area in particular, the interests of the Iraqi villagers and the local prestige of the Iraqi Government have suffered. Minor Matters. 73. In addition to these violations of Iraqi territorial rights, the Iraqi Government have many well-founded complaints of the aggressive and high handed conduct of Persian frontier officials in their relations with their Iraqi colleagues. The Persian Governor of Khuzistan is a particularly blatant offender, and the Mutessarif of Amara finds it impossible to obtain from him any reason able co-operation in dealing with frontier affairs. The Governor of Mansurabad is similarly lacking in all idea of mutual co-operation with the Iraqi authorities of the Diyala liwa, and further north the Iraqi Kaimakam of Halabja has experienced the same difficulties with the Persian officials now established in the Auroman district. 74. It was in the hope of remedying this state of affairs that the Iraqi Government put forward early in the year the draft Agreement for the Regula tion of Frontier Relations, to which reference has already been made. This was not, however, accepted by the Persian Government, who replied with a counter draft based largely on a frontier relations treaty previously concluded with Afghanistan. Seeing that there was small chance of bringing the Persians to accept their proposals without prolonged negotiations, the Iraqi Government compromised by concluding in December a provisional agreement on the lines of the Persian proposals. This was done by means of an exchange of identic notes providing for the appointment by each Government of six frontier commissioners with headquarters at chosen places along each side of the frontier whose duties were to prevent raids across the border and to co-operate in maintaining order and suppressing crime. This agreement is to remain in force, and the Iraqi Government propose in the meanwhile to bring forward again their own draft, which makes much more detailed arrangements for the regulation of frontier affairs. Persian Consuls. 75. The Persian consul at Basra, Mirza Hasan Khan Badi, who for some time had made himself objectionable to the local Iraqi officials, was transferred in February as the result of representations made to the Persian Government, His successor, Mirza Hasan Khan Dilpak, arrived in July and has given no cause for complaint. 76. The Persian vice-consul at Khaniqin, Mirza Riza Quli Khan Muwaqqar, has also failed to maintain good relations with the local officials.He seems to have learnt nothing from experience and persists in the same contumacious conduct which previously in 1928 forced the Iraqi Governmen ask for his withdrawal from the vice-consulate at Mandali. 77. The Persian Government also have consular representatives at Sulai- mani, Amara, Mosul and Karbala. Saudi A rabia. 78. The Treaty of Friendship and “ Bon-Voisinage ” concluded between Iraq and the Hejaz-Nejd and its Dependencies in April 1931, provided tor tne early establishment of diplomatic relations between the two kingdoms. In e following summer both parties designated their diplomatic representatives. Ihe Iraqi Government appointed Dr. Naji-al-Asil to be Charge d Anaires and consul-general at Jedda, and Ibn Saud selected Rushaid Pasha to represent him in a similar capacity at Bagdad. The Iraqi Government s choice was not a happy one. Dr. Naji-al-Asil had at one time been the late King Hussein s representative in London, and his personal association with the Hashimite family was too close to enable him to act successfully as a representative of Iraqi interests in the Hejaz. Rushaid Pasha had not, up to the close of the year under tepoit, taken up his post at Bagdad. 79. Dr. Naji-al-Asil arrived in Jedda about the middle of February 1932. His letters of credence named him to Mecca and not to Jedda, the headquarters of all other foreign diplomatic missions. This had been done because Nuri Pasha believed that, when he had visited Ibn Saud the previous year, he had obtained a promise that the Iraqi representative would be received at Mecca instead of Jedda. Some misunderstanding had, however, occurred, since, when Dr. Naji-al- Asil arrived to take up his post, his letters of credence were not accepted, and he was informed that the Hejazi Government could not permit him to establish an Iraqi Legation elsewhere than in Jedda. King Faisal thereupon sent a personal letter to King Ibn Saud, requesting him to consent to receive the Iraqi mission at Mecca. Ibn Saud, in a courteous reply, stated that he had no knowledge of any promise having been given to Isuri Pasha that the Iraqi representative would be received in Mecca, and pointed out the difficulties in which his Government would become involved if they were to make, in favour of Iraq, so marked an exception to the rule, which applied to all other countries, that diplomatic missions should be at Jedda. He regretted that, in the circum stances, he could not agree to the Iraqi Legation being established at Mecca. 80. King Faisal consulted the High Commissioner as to the action which should be taken in the matter. The High Commissioner suggested that the King should discuss the point with the Amir Faisal, whose visit to Bagdad was impending, and hinted that it would be better to send to Jedda as Chargd d’Affaires someone less likely to arouse suspicion and distrust than Dr. Naji-al- Asil. 81. The King acted on this advice, and the claim that the Iraqi representa tive should be received at Mecca was ultimately dropped. Dr. Naji-al-Asil, after exchanging ratifications of the two treaties which had been signed by Nuri Pasha the previous April, was recalled to Bagdad, ostensibly to make arrangements for the Amir Faisal’s visit, and in August Rashid Beg-al-Khoja, Iraqi consul-general at Beirut, was appointed Charge d’Affaires at Jedda. He did not, however, proceed to his post, as at the end of October, following the resignation of Nuri Pasha’s Cabinet, he became Minister for Defence. Up to the end of the year his successor had not been designated. The Visit of the A mir Faisal. 82. His Highness the Amir Faisal, son of King Abdul Aziz-al-Saud, arrived in Bagdad on the 8 th July. He was returning from a visit to Europe and came via Angora and Tehran. On the day of his arrival his Highness exchanged calls with the High Commissioner, and in the evening a banquet was given in his honour at the palace. 83. His Highness’s visit passed off quietly and without untoward incident, in spite of the fears which the Hejazi Government had entertained that his life might possibly be in danger in Iraq. Before his arrival, the High Commissioner17 [8744] c had advised King Faisal that he should endeavour to profit from the Amir’s visit, not only, as has already been mentioned, to settle outstanding differences between the Iraqi and Nejd-Hejaz Governments concerning the location of the Iraqi Legation in the Hejaz, but also to do what he could to prepare the way for a better understanding between the Amir Abdullah and King Ibn Baud, whose ^1 mutual relations had been embittered by the Ibn Rifada revolt in Northern Hejaz. The High Commissioner reminded His Majesty of his own meeting with Ibn Baud in 1930, which had caused an immediate relaxation of dangerous tension, and said that he was confident that similarly beneficial results could be obtained from a rapprochement between King Ibn Baud and the Amir Abdullah if His Majesty would use his good offices to bring this about. 84. After the Amir’s departure the King told the High Commissioner that the Amir had received favourably his offer to mediate between the Amir Abdullah and King Ibn Baud, and had undertaken to try and persuade his father to telegraph to King Faisal requesting him to use his good offices, with a view to establishing more friendly relations between the two rulers. 85. King Ibn Baud did not avail himself of King Faisal’s offer, but it is believed that he appreciated the spirit in which it was made, and was pleased with the cordiality of the King’s welcome to his son. For his part, King Faisal used his influence with his brother, the Amir Abdullah, to persuade him to give up all active encouragement of King Ibn Baud’s enemies, not, he admitted frankly, for any reason of personal friendship towards Ibn Baud, but because he was convinced that time was the best friend of the Hashimite cause, and that in the course of only a few years the Wahabi dominion over the Hejaz would melt away. Frontier Incidents. 86 . There was happily no recurrence of the raiding and counter-raiding which in past years has often given so much trouble to the Iraqi Government and to the Royal Air Force in Iraq. Only two incidents occurred which are worth recording. 87. About the middle of February news was received in Bagdad that a Nejdi force of twenty-five camelmen and two armed cars had arrived at Jadaidat-al-Arar, a desert well on the border-line in the south of the Wadian area. Shortly after their arrival they moved across the frontier into Iraqi territory, and demanded taxes from some of the followers of Mahrut-bin- Hadhdhal, sheikh of the big Amarat tribe of Iraq. Two armoured cars of the Desert Area Police Force were sent to investigate the matter on the spot, whereupon the Nejdis withdrew. Early in April, however, the Nejdi commander with his small force, again came a few miles north of the frontier into Iraq, and demanded tribute from some of the Amarat, claiming that they were grazing in Nejdi territory. The commandant of the Southern Desert Area Police once more went to the Wadian area to support the Iraqi tribes against this intrusion, and the Nejdis a little later withdrew. At the same time, the Iraqi Government took up the matter with the Hejaz-Nejd Government. 88 . Article 1 (b) of the Treaty of Mohammerah lays down in principle that in settling the frontier between Iraq and Nejd, the lands and wells of the Shammar of Nejd should be included in Nejd, and those of the Muntafiq, Dhafir and Amarat should be included in Iraq. Jadaidat-al-Arar is an Amarat well, and it can therefore be argued that it belongs to Iraq. But article 1 {d) of the Protocol of Uqair, by which the frontier was subsequently defined, specifically mentions Jadaidat-al-Arar as a point on the boundary line. Moreover, the maps used by the negotiators of the Uqair Protocol were inaccurate, with the result that the frontier, as defined thereon, places part of the traditional Amarat grazing grounds in Nejd territory, a fact to which it would be unwise for the Iraqi Government to draw attention. For these reasons, in sending instructions to their representatives in the Hejaz to make representations to the Hejaz-Nejd Government on the subject of the intrusion of the tax-collectors at Jadaidat-al- Arar, it has been thought best not to claim that these wells were in Iraq territory, but to ask for the withdrawal of the Nejdi force on the ground that its presence at a well in the vicinity of the frontier was a contravention of article 3 of the Protocol of Uqair.18 89. These representations were successful and by the end of April the Nejdis had withdrawn. 90. The second incident was brought to notice by a protest made by the He j az- Neid Government in August regarding an incursion into Nejd territory by the Iraqi police. From the enquiries which were then made, it was discovered that the commandant, who had recently been appointed to the Southern Desert -^ r 6 a &gt; found on arrival at his post that all the maps, copies of treaties and othei omcial documents had been removed with the effects of his predecessor. He did not icport this, but carried on quite undismayed with only the scantiest knowledge of the limits of his area and the position of the frontier. Consequently, when some Iraqi tribes complained that they were being bothered by Nejdi tax-collectors, he promptly visited their encampments and expelled the Nejdi officials from places so far south of the frontier as Bishak and A1 Hafar. Naturally, this egregious performance provoked a strong protest from the Hejaz-Nejd Government, and the Iraqi Government had to instruct their representative at Jedda to make adequate apologies. The Hashimite Properties. 91. At the time of King Ali’s surrender of Jedda to King Ibn Saud in December 1925 an agreement was made between the two parties whereby the latter granted to King Hussein’s family all their personal properties in the Hejaz. King Faisal and King Ali have always complained of the obstructions placed by the Hejaz-Nejd Government in the way of the proper administration of their properties by their agents, and although the matter cannot properly be considered an Iraqi interest, there is no doubt that the Iraqi representative in the Hejaz was made clearly to understand that one of his chief tasks was to endeavour to secure for the Hashimite family a fuller and more profitable control of their properties. 92. Towards the end of October the Iraqi Charge d’Affaires at Jedda reported to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that the Hejazi Government had decided to take over the administration of the Hashimite properties, and King Faisal asked for the good offices of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to safeguard the proper observance of the agreement of December 1925, basing his request on the fact that the agreement had been concluded with the help of the British agent and consul at Jedda. 93. The matter was referred to the Secretary of State, who replied that the policy of His Majesty’s Government had been to avoid direct intervention in the matter, and that they would prefer to maintain this attitude. It was accordingly suggested, both to King Faisal and to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, who had also raised the matter in a note, that the whole question should be investigated and a report furnished by the next Iraqi Charge d’Affaires when he took up his post, in the hope that he would be able to propose a means of direct settlement between the two Governments. Soviet Union. Tbe Iraqi Government have not yet been recognised by the Russian boviet Government, and no diplomatic relations exist between the two countries. 95 Towards the end of 1931, however, the Shark Agency in Tehran approached the 1 raqi Legation with a request for permission to open an agency m Iraq, and stated that if this were done they would make large purchases of Iraqi wool With the concurrence of the High Commissioner, the Iraqi Govern ment agreed to permit a Shark representative to come to Iraq and to remain for three months. Ihe Shark Aerencv aenp.ntprl thia or,^i ^ • i uaiiicu Kjiiaivci oauiiaii ivuuion, apparently ot iartar extraction, arrived in Bagdad on the 7th January. On the expiry of the first three months of his stay m Iraq his permission to reside in the country was extended for a further period and he did not leave Iraq until the beginning of July. F November application was made for permission for him to return but this had not been given by the end of the year. 519 Syria. „ [8744] Syria. The League Commission on the Frontier. 97. At their 65th Session, held in Paris in December 1931, the Council of the League of Nations considered a joint note by His Majesty s Government ^in the United Kingdom and the French Government relating to the delimitation *of the frontier between Iraq and Syria. The note explained that ceitain difficulties had been encountered in carrying out the provisions of article 1 of the convention signed in December 1920. In the first place, dr.eigenues of opinion existed as to the exact interpretation of the frontier which the convention was intended to define. Secondly, it was found that whatever internretation was placed on the convention, a frontier drawn m strict conformity therewith would be likely to be unsatisfactory in certain section 8 for military political, administrative, tribal, economic, geogi aphical and other reasons, and that it was not within the competence of such as that referred to in the convention to modify the frontier defined therein to an extent sufficient to remove the unsatisfactory features this reason the two mandatory Powers proposed that the Co ^ n ^^ 9 s n ho ^ f ' n od f fie d a frontier between Iraq and Syria based on the convention of 1920 but modined as required by the considerations aforementioned, the frontier so indicated to be accepted by all concerned as a definite solution of the frontier question The note further suggested that the task of the Council would be facilitated by the apP 01 ^- ment of a commission which would collect on the spot such information and make such recommendations as might assist the Council to reach a decision. Th Council after referring the matter in the usual manner to a rapporteur to the request of the two mandatory Powers and appointed the following commission to report on the whole question . President— . . . Colonel James de Reynier (Swiss). Members— . M. Pedro Marades (Spaniard). M. Carl Petersen (Swede). 98 The two members of the commission arrived in Bagdad on the 26th March The president, however, delayed his onward journey from Beiru and set out'on the 29th March to fly to Bagdad in an aeroplane of the French Orient Line The machine flew into a heavy sandstorm 80 miles east of Rutbah and crashed all the occupants, Colonel de Reynier, the French pilot and his mechanic, being killed. Colonel Iselin (Swiss) was sw ' af t®;]yU,.f 1 PPO Qn ^he the post of president and joined his colleagues on the 29th Ap . 16th May the commission, having finished their enquiries, dispei sed. 99 The report and recommendations of the commission were communi cated to the Governments concerned about the middle of September and were considered by the Council of the League at their 68 th Session held at Geneva at the beginning of October. 100 In presenting their case to the commission, the British and Iraqi assessors had put forward juridical, economic, strate^wnnm^ratne “ ^ er arguments for a frontier line beginning at Faish Khabur ana men iouu b the Wadi Sofan westwards to the end of the Qara Chok Hills thence m sou ' westerly direction round the western extremity of the Jabal Sin jar southwards to Abu Kamal. . 101. The French and Syrian assessors made claims to a frontier taking ott from the Tigris some 20 miles south of Faish Khabur and whence followig^ convex line to Abu Kamal, which left practically the whole of the Jabal Smjar in Syria. 102 Thp commission in their report to the Council of the League, recommended a line running directly south-west of the Jabal Siniar, thence westwards round the western end ot the femjar itange and from there southwards in an approximately straight line to a point just east of Abu Kamal A minority recommendation was, however, made for the western end of the Jabal Smjar (known as the Jabal Janba) to be awarded toi„ js /mxsss a mission also recommended this line for this sector of the fion . . . , 104. From the point of view of Iraq and Great Britain the commission s report had the following unsatisfactory features . ^ (а) In one of the important areas in dispute, i.e., the Jabal Sin.jar, it was no ( б ) In the‘mosT northerly sector of to Syria V ^ Siniar it recommended a line which left the Karacnok JJagn to y and 3 cut off from Iraq a large area, hitherto under Iraqi ad minis tration, which was the habitual grazing ground of certain I^q r be^ The loss of the Karachok Dagh was regarded as being particular y serious from the point of view of the defence of the north-west fi ontie of Iraq, as it was felt that without these hills Iraq would be exposed to easy attack by the route constantly chosen by invading forces m e oast. 105. From the French point of view the commission s recommendations were open to the objection that they allotted the whole of the Jabal Sin]ar to Iraq. 106. At the suggestion of the French delegation and with the agreememt of the Iraqi Prime Minister, Sir Francis Humphrys and M. Ponsot (the French High Commissioner for Syria) discussed the matter at Geneva towards the end o September with a view to examining the possibility of reaching a private agree ment before it came up before the Council. M. Ponsot appeared willing to accept the majority recommendation regarding the Sin jar, but could not be induced to agree to any alteration in the northern sector which would give the Karachok Dagh to Iraq unless Syria were given a substantial quid pro quo in the Sin jar. 107. The Iraqi Government were not, however, prepared to make such a concession, as they preferred to make certain of obtaining the whole of the Sin jar now and to wait to secure a sounder strategical frontier later by direct agreement when Syria was released from mandatory control. 108. In the end both sides agreed to accept the frontier recommended by the majority report of the commission. 109. As a corollary to their frontier recommendations the commission also recommended that a special agreement should be concluded between Iraq and Syria to settle in accordance with local custom the frontier regime and the problems of seasonal migration which were of particular importance in the region of the Syrio-Iraqi frontier. The question was also discussed by Sir Francis Humphrys and Nuri Pasha with M. Ponsot and a draft outline of a suitable agreement was drawn up and initialled by them at Geneva on the 3 rd October. 110 . One other major recommendation was made by the commission in their report. The frontier line which they recommended, except where it follows a watercourse, is formed by a series of straight lines connecting points which are defined on an accompanying map. The commission recommended that these points should constitute the fixed points of the frontier, the actual line between these points being determined by a subsequent Boundary Commission with suffi ciently wide powers to take into account local needs and the possible inaccuracy of the maps on which the commission had drawn the frontier which they recommended. ,r 111 . After referring the commission’s report to the Permanent Mandates Commission, the Council, at their 69th Session in November 1932, finally adopted the frontier line unanimously suggested by the commission and in the Sinjar area the line indicated by the majority of that commission. ' Frontier Incidents. 112 The year under review was happily free from serious disturbances between Syrian and Iraqi tribes on the frontier. In January raiding broke out m the Iraq-Transjordan corridor between the Ruwalla and Saba’ tribes, in which21 / 2 Jg the former seem to have been the aggressors. As both of these tribes owe allegiance to Syria, and only pass through Iraq in the course of their seasona migration, these raids were not of any particular importance to the Iraqi boyern- ment. The Saba’ and the Iraqi Amarat tribes are, however, old allies, and there was a possibility that the latter might give support to the former against the ^Ruwalla. The situation was therefore carefully watched and the desert police strengthened until in the course of their migratory movements the Saba and Ruwalla separated and the danger was past. 113. In August arrangements were made for the Iraqi Kaimakam at Ana to hold regular monthly meetings with the French Special Service Officer at Abu Kamal for the settlement of minor frontier incidents. Similar meetings ot the Mutessarif of Ramadi and the French delegue at Dair-al-Zor were also arranged to take place half-yearly, to deal with matters not disposed of by the Specia Service Officer of Abu Kamal and the Kaimakam of Ana. 114 On the 2nd October a body of some 300 tribesmen attacked the small Syrian town of Abu Kamal situated on the Euphrates close to the Syno-iraq frontier. After a sharp fight they were beaten off, but one French ofhcei and two soldiers were wounded. The Syrian authorities believed at first that the attackers had been assisted by tribesmen from Iraq but it was later established that they were Syrian tribesmen of the Aqaidat. After the failure of the attack the Sheikh of the Aqaidat, Mushrif-al-Dandal, with several subordinate headmen and a number of tribesmen, fled to Iraq where they were disarmed and removed from the frontier. The French delegue from Dair-al-Zor visited Bagdad on the 15th October and arranged with the Iraqi Government for suitable measures to be taken to prevent the fugitive Aqaidat from causing trouble over the border from their refuge in Iraq. Kina Faisal and the Syrian Throne. 115 There can be no doubt that King Faisal still hopes for the day when Iraq and Syria will be united in one kingdom under his rule. Nor is he satisfied merely to hope. He nurses his Syrian supporters carefully and maintains close toucl/with the Nationalist elements. During the early months of the year the \rabic Dress in both Syria and Iraq constantly published articles in which the accession of Amir Abdullah, King Ali or King Faisal to the Syrian Throne was discussed but with the coming of the Syrian elections and the subsequent opening of the first Syrian Parliament speculative journalism of this kind decreased. The King’s dream of ruling the Arab world from Damascus was not however, disturbed by these events or by the failure of the Monarchist candidates in the elections and he has continued patiently and cautiously to work for the ultimate realisation of his ambitions. In Iraq, although the newspapers are always ready to make a show of sympathy with their “ oppressed ” brethren in Syria, there is no popular desire for the union of the country with Syria. It is generally thought that this would lead to Damascus becoming the capital of the two kingdoms, in which event Bagdad would once more lapse into provincial insig nificance and the country would be bled to pay for the upkeep of an expensive Court and Government, whose patronage would be enjoyed exclusively by the Syrians. Moreover, thoughtful people consider that the geographical situation of the two countries makes it impossible for them successfully to be administered as one kingdom and foresee that if the King were to go to Damascus he would lose Iraq, which would soon break away from his rule. Transjordan. 116 Kins Ali visited Amman during the summer, according to his usual custom, for a change of air. His Majesty left Bagdad in June and returned in August. 117 Kins Faisal also visited his brother the Amir Abdullah later in the year and spent a week in Amman in September The Amir Abdullah returned this visit in November and stayed a week m Bagdad. 118 In anticipation of the possibility of the question of the frontier between Iraq and Transjordan being raised at Geneva when the time came foi [8744] C 322 Iraq’s candidature for arrangements were made in July 101 tne exis 0 countries to be defined more precisely. 119 This was done by means of an exchange of notes, signed by the Prime Minister of eacT Government, agreeing to the followmg defimtion of the , frontier :— “ The frontier between Iraq and Transjordan starts in the south at the point of junction of the Iraqi-Nejd frontier and ^MSjordan-Nejd frontier and ends in the north at that point on the Iraq-Synan fiontiu and the Transjordan-Syrian frontier, as ultimately delimited which is nearest to the summit of Jabal Tanf. Between these two terminal points the frontier follows, where possible, prominent features, provided that it shall not diverge more than 5 kilom. from a straight line between these two terminal points. 120. During April the Cabinet discussed a proposal for the complete removal of all customs barriers between Iraq and Transjordan for the natural and industrial produce of the two countries. It was brought to their notice, however, that under the existing “ Accord provisoire ” between Iraq and 1 ersia, Persia has the right to claim most-favoured-nation treatment m customs matters without any restriction as to agreements between Iraq and neighbouring Arab States. The proposal had consequently to be dropped until a commercial agree ment could be concluded with Persia which would permit of the establishment of special customs arrangements with Transjordan without giving Persia the right to claim similar treatment for her produce. Turkey. 121. The beginning of the year found Nuri Pasha, the Iraqi Prime Minister, at Angora, negotiating Treaties of Residence, Commerce and Extradition with the Turkish Government. His endeavours were successful, and the three treaties were signed on the 10th January. 122. The Residence Convention contained no special features, and merely provided that in all matters the subjects of each State should enjoy the most favoured-nation treatment. 123. The Treaty of Commerce similarly provided for the most-favoured nation treatment for the commerce of both countries, excepting, however, such special concessions as might be made by either country to the produce of other countries detached from the ancient Ottoman Empire. 124. The Extradition Treaty followed the usual models and maintained in force the special arrangements of article 9 of the Treaty of Angora of 1926. 125. Other matters dealt with during the negotiations were :— ( 1 ) Co-operation on the Turco-Iraq frontier, with regard to which it was agreed that special frontier officers should be appointed by both sides to keep in close touch in order to deal promptly with frontier incidents. (2) The entry of Iraqi dates into Turkey. In exchange for a reduction by one-third of Iraqi customs dues on firewood and gall-nuts, Turkey undertook to allow dates to the value of £T. 100,000 to enter annually, with a similar preferential reduction of customs duty. (3) Turkish participation in oil royalties. This matter is discussed in the next paragraph. Turkish Participation in Iraqi Oil. 126. Article 14 of the tripartite Treaty of Angora of June 1926 between the United Kingdom, Iraq and Turkey provided that the Iraqi Government should pay to the Turkish Government, for a period of twenty-five years from the coming into force of that treaty, 10 per cent, of all royalties received from companies exploiting oil in the area accorded to the Iraq Petroleum Company by the convention of 1925. In the event, however, the Iraqi Government derived no revenue from the Iraq Petroleum Company until the second convention was concluded with the company in 1931, and the Turkish Government advanced a[8744] c 4 a v t 23 claim for the amendment of article 14 of the Treaty of Angora to make the twenty-five years’ period of their participation in the Iraqi Government s revenues from the oil-fields begin from 1931 instead of 1926. Nuri Pasha reached an agreement with the Turkish Government on this matter, the terms of which . were embodied in an exchange of notes. The chief points of the agreement ' were :— (1) That the twenty-five-year period mentioned in the Treaty of Angora should begin from January 1931. (2) That payment on account of Turkey’s 10 per cent, share should cover the whole area allotted to the Iraq Petroleum Company in the 1925 convention. (3) That if for any reason no payment is made in any particular year, the Turkish share in respect of such a year shall be paid separately. (4) That the United Kingdom Government, as signatories to the Treaty of Angora, should be invited to take part in the negotiations which would be 'necessary to amend the treaty in accordance with the above arrangements. 127. In regard to this last provision, the Iraqi Government were later informed that His Majesty’s Government did not wish to participate in the preliminary negotiations, provided they were kept informed of their progress. Frontier Affairs. 128. There were no meetings during the year of the Permanent Frontier Commission set up under article 13 of the Treaty of Angora, but lurkish and Iraqi officials continued to correspond with each other directly about frontier incidents. At the end of July the Kaimakam of Zakho met the .Turkish Kaimakam of Jazirah-ibn-Omar. Friendly relations were established and a number of small frontier matters were discussed with satisfactory icsults. 129. Raiding across the border from the Turkish side of the frontier into Iraq was less than in the previous year. I he worst offenders were still the Goyan tribe, who made several incursions into the Sindi nahiyah of the Zakho qadha. The Bombing of Barokh. 130. In June the Turkish Government, through their Minister at Bagdad, protested to the Iraqi Government against the bombing of the Turkish village of Barokh by aircraft from Iraq. Barokh lies close to the Turco-Iraq frontier, to the north of the area in which the operations against Sheikh Ahmad of Barzan were at that time being carried on. It was alleged that ten persons had been killed and a similar number wounded, and monetary compensation was claimed for them and their dependants. A reply was sent suggesting that officials from both sides should make a joint enquiry on the spot, and in October this was arranged. It was ascertained that on the evening of a day early in June (probably the 1 st June), a Royal Air Force aeroplane dropped eight bombs (probably 20 -pounders) on the village, and that a number of casualties were caused thereby to the people who were there at the time. Slight damage was also done to property and cattle; this was estimated to amount in all to about 8.000 Iraqi dinars (£ 8 ). 131. No further action was taken in regard to this matter before the end of the year, the Iraqi Government being of the opinion that if the Turkish Government took a serious view of the incident, it was for them to make the next move. United States of America. 132. With the termination of the special relations between His Majesty's Government and the Iraqi Government established by the tieaties of 1922 and 1926 the Tripartite Convention between Iraq, Great Britain and the United States of America concluded in 1930 ceased to have effect, and, under article 7 of this convention it became necessary for negotiations to be opened between the United States of America and Iraq for the conclusion of a treaty to govern their future relations and the rights of the nationals of each country m the territory24 of the other The convention also provided that, pending the conclusion of such a treaty, United States citizens and, in general, the interests of the United States of America should enjoy most-favoured-nation treatmen . 133 Negotiations for the conclusion of a new treaty were opened in Bagdad between the American Charge d’Affaires and the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs, but had not been finished by the end of the year. The Yemen. 134 A Yemen delegation arrived in Bagdad on the 17th April to exchange ratifications of the Yemen-Iraq Treaty of Friendship signed at Sanaa the previous May. The members of the delegation were Qadhi Muhammad-bm- Ahmad-al-Hijri. Director of Customs at Hudaidah, and beyyid Y ahia-bin-Seyyid Muhammad-al-Kulaisi, Kaimakam of Hudaidah. They came to Basi a by the Russian Soviet ship Vostock. Ratifications were exchanged on the 26th Apt il and the delegation left Iraq on the 6 th May after making a short tour ot the northern liwas. 135. Towards the close of the year there were indications that King Faisal was considering the possibility of fostering closer relations with the Yemen by means of a permanent diplomatic mission at bana a. He professed to fear the growth of Russian Soviet and Italian influence in the Yemen, and to believe that an Iraqi representative would be an effective counterpoise. Other Countries. 136. The following countries have honorary consuls at Bagdad or Basra; Norway, Sweden, Greece, the Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium and Poland. The Czechoslovakian consul-general at Jerusalem includes Iraq within his consular district. 137. Article 5 of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of the 18th October, 1922, provided that “where His Majesty the King of Iraq is not represented he agrees to entrust the protection of Iraqi nationals to His Britannic Majesty.” This treaty ceased to have effect from the date of the admission of Iraq to the League of Nations, and the treaty of 1930, which thereupon came into force, contained no provision for the continuation of this arrangement. In September the Iraqi Government addressed the Acting-High Commissioner on this subject and requested that His Majesty’s Government would continue, after the coming into force of the new treaty, to protect Iraqi interests in foreign countries, where there is no Iraqi representation. They also requested that His Majesty’s consular officers should continue to protect Iraqi interests in Turkey, Persia and French mandated territory in the Levant, in districts where there were no Iraqi consular officers, and asked that His Majesty’s representative at Cairo should continue to help in diplomatic matters. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom acceded to these requests, and issued instructions to British diplomatic and consular representatives accordingly. III.—Internal Affairs (Political). Parliament. The Seventh Session. 138. After a month’s adjournment from the middle of December 1931 Parliament reassembled on the 16th January to continue its seventh ordinary session. This would normally have terminated at the end of March, but it was prolonged by Royal Iradah for a month, as the budget for the financial year 1932-33 had not then been passed through the Chamber. Subsequently, the session was twice further prolonged and Parliament was not prorogued until the 31st May. b 139. Both Houses of Parliament worked hard throughout the session and dealt, in all, with oyer eighty Bills. The large majority of these were, however, financial or administrative measures establishing credits not included in the25 'IIP] budget estimates or making minor amendments to existing laws whose detail had been found in practice to be faulty. The budget was, as usual, the main issue of the session. The rule whereby the annual estimates are first referred for examina tion to a Standing Committee, and are then again debated in detail by the Chamber, provides an opportunity for criticism of the whole work of Government ^ which even the most subservient Chamber is always eager to seize. Deputies can ventilate their grievances against particular departments by proposing their abolition or the reduction of the money allotted to them, and every enthusiastic theorist has a chance to press his opinions and schemes on the attention of the Government. Much time in each session is in consequence taken up by the budget debates, and these are frequently the main cause, as they were in the present instance, of the prolongation of the session beyond its statutory period. 140. Another important item of the session’s work was the draft Iraqi declaration to the League. In many quarters it was anticipated that this would meet with serious opposition. But the Prime Minister, Nuri Pasha, had the Chamber well in hand, and the draft was accepted by an overwhelming majority after only a short debate. 141. Other Bills of importance which were passed were : The British Oil Development Concession Law, the Gara (Bassam) Minerals Concession Law, the Law Supplemental to the Judges and Qadhis Law, and the Laws for the adhesion of Iraq to the Paris Pact for the Outlawry of War (1928) and the International Arms Convention (1923). Parliament also ratified Treaties of Friendship with the Yemen, of Commerce, Kesidence and Extradition with Turkey, and of Extradition with Great Britain. Fuller reference to this legislation will be found in subsequent sections of this report. The Cabinet. 142. Nuri Pasha’s Cabinet was reformed in October 1931 in the following manner :— Prime Minister : Nuri Pasha A1 Said. Minister for the Interior : Naji Beg Shaukat. Minister for Finance : Rustam Beg Haidar. Minister for Justice : Jamal Beg Baban. Minister for Defence and Foreign Affairs: General Ja far Pasha A1 Askar i. Minister for Economics and Communications : Amin Zaki Beg. Minister for Education : Abdul Husain Chalabi. It remained unchanged until the end of October 1932, when Nuri Pasha and his colleagues resigned in circumstances which are described in a later section of this report. The Eighth Session. 143. The eighth session opened in accordance with the Constitution on the 1st November, but the Cabinet had fallen a few days before and dissolution was already in the air. 144. The King opened his Speech from the Throne with a reference to the great importance of the admission of Iraq to the League of Nations and to the new responsibilities which the event placed on the Iraqi nation. He then expressed in general terms his gratitude and the gratitude of his people to His Majesty King George and the British nation, and to the Governments of neighbouring countries for the goodwill which they had shown towards Iraq and for the help which they had given her in achieving her independence. His Majesty reminded Parliament that as Iraq had now assumed complete control of her own destinies, it was necessary to lay down a policy in the light of these responsibilities. 145. In the Chamber, after the election of the President, Nuri Pasha gave an account of the work of his Cabinet. 146. During his period of office, the country had, he said, passed through one of the most critical and important phases of its history, and, thanks to the work of Parliament, it had won its independence through admission to the League of Nations.147. He and his colleagues, he claimed, had carried out to the u e programme of work which they had undertaken. When they came m o o ce, security had been maintained, many big works of construction had been egun and taxation had been sensibly reduced. Achievements of even greater impor ance were the termination of the mandate and the final abolition of the old Lapitu a- tions. All this had only been accomplished through the help and wise guidance of His Majesty the King. His Cabinet had resigned, but the only reason foi this was that he and his colleagues had done what they had set out to do and now needed rest. In conclusion, he said that he could not let the occasion pass without a grateful acknowledgment of the help which Iraq had received from all States with whom she had relations, and especially her ally, Great Britain. 148. At the next meeting, held on the 9th November, a Royal Iradah was issued dissolving Parliament. Resignation of Nuri Pasha. 149. Throughout the seventh session Nuri Pasha maintained his strong position in the Chamber. The Deputies elected in the autumn of 1930 had, with few exceptions, been his nominees, and the resignation in May 1931 of \asin-al- Hashimi, Naji-al-Suwaidi, Rashid Ali-al-Gilani and Ali Jaudat removed any possibility of an efiective Opposition being built up within the House. Outside Parliament, however, the Government had to contend with considerable hostile activity. Early in the year the Nationalist press attacked them incessantly with bitter articles, and the two affiliated political organisations, the Nationalist party and the party of National Brotherhood, carried on a steady propaganda against the Government in the southern provinces, particularly on the Euphrates. Of the six daily newspapers published in the capital, four were hostile, and the remaining two were subsidised supporters. The most trenchant critics of the Government were two men named Eahim Beg-al-Mudarris and Raphael Butti. Efforts to deal with them through the Press Law were unavailing, for, as soon as the Minister of the Interior suspended their newspaper they brought it out again under a new name, an elementary device with which the law Avas unable to contend. At last, in the middle of March, their attacks became so violent that the Government, in desperation, took action against them under Section 40 of the Tribal, Civil and Criminal Disputes Regulations, and deported them both from Bagdad to Arbil. There they were kept out of mischief for a couple of months, and, though Raphael Butti returned to journalism in the autumn, he did so in a chastened spirit. The Government also took steps to deal with the anomalies of the Press Law, and an amending law was passed towards the close of the seA^enth session which greatly strengthened official control over the press. Under its application, the Government’s critics were one by one eliminated, until, by the time Nuri Pasha’s Cabinet fell, only two daily newspapers were being published in Bagdad. 150. The Government also treated the Nationalist parties with similar firmness. Frequent applications for permission to open branches in provincial centres were refused, and a stern warning was given to their headquarters in Bagdad that public meetings and demonstrations would not be allowed. At the same time they employed their control of patronage with considerable effect to win over critics and to detach supporters from the Opposition parties. 151. On the other side, Yasin Pasha, the most eminent of the Government’s opponents, played a skilful role, and, while maintaining his reputation as a disinterested Nationalist, was careful not to commit himself to anything but oracularly vague pronouncements on policy. He left it to the secretary of the Nationalist party, Ja’far Chalabi Abu Timmun, to be the spokesman of the extremists, and to declare their intransigent hostility to the treaty of 1930. 152. During the seventh session, the Government obtained from Parliament wider powers for dealing with subversive propaganda and incitement to disorder These were embodied in the “Law Prohibiting Harmful Propaganda’’ and the “ Law for the Maintenance of Public Order in Time of Strikes.’’ &amp; The central feature of the first law is the power which it gives to the Government to fix the place of residence of persons conducting harmful propaganda and to place them27 under police surveillance, while the second gives powers to prosecute those who intimidate non-strikers or who disseminate false and misleading reports in times of serious industrial troubles. 153. Although, in the manner which has been outlined above, Nuri Pasha maintained with a firm hand the authority of his Government, both in Parliament and in the country, towards the close of the seventh session he began rapidly to lose his personal influence with the King. It was as a palace favourite that he had been called upon in March 1930 to form a Government, and the relaxation of the Royal favour sapped the foundation of his position. King Faisal seems to have had little real cause to be displeased with his Prime Minister, who had served him faithfully and had carried through with conspicuous success the policy which His Majesty had directed. Neither his loyalty nor his ability could, however, save him from a temporary eclipse. The King tired of him; was possibly a little jealous of his prominence in affairs; and, when a serious difference arose between them concerning a matter in which the King was deeply interested personally, their old ties had become too weak to stand the strain and snapped. 154. The affair which gave rise to this quarrel between the King and Nuri Pasha had no real national or even political importance, but, as it became the issue over which their mutual confidence finally broke down, and which therefore led to the formation of a new Government and to a general election, a brief record of its main features is desirable. 155. In the summer of 1931, at the time of the shopkeepers’ strike against the new municipal taxes, a number of anonymous typewritten letters were circulated accusing the Mayor of Bagdad of having sought to obtain Royal favour by allowing his wife to become the King’s mistress. Rumour ascribed responsibility for these letters to several highly-placed persons, and the matter attracted much attention in the press. After over six months active enquiiy the police collected sufficient evidence to obtain, in May 1932, warrants for the anest of four junior clerks, who were charged with having typed and posted these letters. The evidence in the hands of the police also inculpated Muzahim Beg-al- Pachachi, a leading public and political figure, who had been Minister foi the Interior at the time of the strike, and was still a Deputy in the Chambei. Ihe magistrate in charge of the case asked for the suspension of Muzahim Beg s parliamentary immunities, in order that he might be arrested and charged together with the others, who, it was alleged, were merely his accomplices Nuri Pasha did not wish this to be done, but the Minister of Justice, pi omp e by the King, supported the magistrate’s request. A quarrel ensued, and the Minister of Justice resigned. The King, m his turn, was indignant with Nuri Pasha, who also resigned, and at one time even talked oi suicide. 156. Both appealed for moral support to the High Commissioner who was in consequence placed in an exceedingly delicate position. He uige iem 0 consider the deplorable impression which would be created, especia y a by a shady domestic scandal, and urged them to put the vita m eies s o ® country before their personal feelings in a matter which was, w en viewe Y and in proper perspective, trivial and insignificant. Eventua y, A. e ^ bitter words had passed between the King and his liime i &gt; reconciliation was brought about largely through t e peisona Sir Kinahan Cornwallis, the adviser to the Ministry o ie • , , reconciliation was, however, more apparent than real, an el ® j? that from that time onward the King resolved to dismiss ^ • ujg Iraq had been admitted to the League. J ea ^? us ^: ^ 00, i ^ j tbroup-h his old friendship with Nuri. Since taking office in 1930, the latter had, thioug visits to Geneva, London, Rome, Angora and Tehran become an interna ^ figure, and the King was not pleased to be even P a p ia y f nil lV iL s DO sition returned to Bagdad at the end of October Nun ,. as • Privatelv untenable, and his first audience with the King lee o 18 tj ‘ DreS erved the feeling between them was bitter, but outwardly e p P could be and Nuri Pasha consented to remain in office until a new Government could be formed.28 The New Cabinet. 157. In discussing the New Cabinet with His Majesty s Minister, theKing made no secret of his keen desire that Yasin Pasha should be the next 1 rime Minister, but he declared that he would not give his confidence to him unless he openly announced his acceptance of the position created by the Treaty of Alliance ^ of 1930. Yasin Pasha was quite willing to return to power, and it may be doubted whether he really felt strongly about the treaty, but his long and intimate association with the two political parties which had declared the treaty unacceptable made it difficult for him to meet the King s condition. In the end the King’s choice of a successor to Nuri Pasha fell on Naji Beg Shaukat, and on the 3rd November a Royal Iradah was issued appointing the following Cabinet:— Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior : Naji Beg Shaukat. Minister for Finance : Nasrat Beg-al-Farisi. Minister for Foreign Affairs : Abdul Qadir Beg-al-Rashid. Minister for Justice : Jamil Beg-al-Wadi. Minister for Defence : Rashid Beg-al-Khoja. Minister for Economics and Communications : Jallal Beg Baban. Minister for Education : Abbas Beg Mahdi. With the exception of the Prime Minister none of the new Ministers had either previous experience of Cabinet office or association with any of the then existing political organisations. All had, however, the reputation of being sound officials. The Dissolution. 158. At the general election in 1930 all but six of the Deputies returned were declared supporters of Nuri Pasha, and Naji Beg felt the existing Chamber was unlikely to give him adequate support. He therefore advised the King to dissolve Parliament. The King too, it is believed, was in favour of dissolution, as he strongly disapproved of many of the men whose election Nuri Pasha had secured and wished to see back in Parliament a number of the more prominent figures in public life whom Nuri Pasha had either estranged or excluded. The Arrival of the Ambassador. 159. Following his appointment to be the first British Ambassador at King Faisal’s Court, Sir Francis Humphrys arrived in Bagdad on the 8 th November. By that time the political crisis, which had begun with Nuri Pasha’s resignation on the 27th October, was ended; the new Cabinet had been appointed and the Iradah dissolving Parliament had been signed. It was too late, therefore, for him to be able to attempt to influence the course of events. In a long private audience which he had with the King on the day after his arrival, he took the opportunity to explain, however, to His Majesty the unfortunate impression which was likely to be created both in London and Geneva by the sudden and apparently unnecessary dismissal of the Cabinet and Parlia ment which had concluded and ratified the Treaty of Alliance of 1930 and had only a few months before authorised the Prime Minister to make a solemn declara tion to the League on a number of important matters of international concern Such an event was likely to be regarded with grave misgivings and would give rise to the fear that the Government which had so summarily been removed would be replaced by another which would endeavour to modify or even reverse the policy of their predecessors. 160. The King readily appreciated the force of the Ambassador’s observa tions, but assured him most categorically that the change of Government had no connexion with external policy. His dissatisfaction with Nuri Pasha had arisen entirely from the latter’s handling of internal affairs No one valued more highly than he the work which Nuri Pasha had done for Iraq in the matter of the Treaty of Alliance with Great Britain and the admission of Iraq to membership of the League of Nations, but for a considerable time he had had serious differences with him about home affairs, particularly in regard to his appointments to the public services. The wide divergence of their views over this question had been the principal reason for the Prime Minister’s resignation He29 was confident, however, that the programme which the new Cabinet would publish in a few days would dispel the misgivings and doubts to which the Ambassador had referred. The Programme of the New Cabinet. 161. The new Cabinet published their programme on the 17th November. Under the heading of Foreign Policy they announced their intention of giving especial care to the strengthening of friendly relations with Great Britain in the spirit of the alliance existing between the two countries and to the fulfilment of Iraq s obligations as a member of the League. In domestic policy their chief undertakings were to improve the efficiency of the civil service, to limit current expenditure to the minimum consistent with the proper working of the public services and to consider the best means of strengthening the army through the participation of the people in the defence of their country. 162. The Nationalist party, in a statement issued on the 30th November, criticised the programme for its ambiguity and for the fact that it contained no declaration of policy in regard to the rights of the people, which, it was alleged, has been violated by some of the laws passed by Nuri Pasha’s Cabinet. It closed with the following summing up of the party’s position :— “ And whereas the Nationalist party opposed the treaty of the 30th June, 1930, and promised the nation to strive for the protection of the Constitution, they have unanimously resolved to stand in opposition to the Cabinet and to continue their legitimate efforts for real liberty and freedom, relying on the loyalty and assistance of the Iraqi nation.” 163. The affiliated political organisation, the Party of National Brother hood, of which Yasin Pasha is the leading spirit, refrained from commenting publicly on the programme of the new Cabinet. The Elections. 164. Orders were issued to all Mutessarifs on the 3rd December to set in notion the machinery for the general elections but up to the close of the year ;he application of the somewhat involved procedure of the Electoral Law had not massed much beyond the stage of the election of the local supervisory committees. The Assyrians. 165. In the autumn of 1931 the prospect of the termination of the British andate during the course of the coming year gave rise to much misgiving among le Assyrians as to their future in Iraq, and their uneasines • P an( j i a petition to the League of Nations signed by the Patriarch, Mar Shimun,^ le principal maliks asking for permission to omigi'.i c t..',,,,,. Secretariat uropean country. This petition was forwarded o fAnp Permanent irough the Foreign Office, but as there was no summer ses autumn by landates Commission it did not come up for examination until the autumn, by, r hich time other events had rendered it obsolete. 166. The request put forward in this petition must be ^athe? itended to bring the fear of the Assyrians to the a e must have been ban as a seriout proposal for a solution of their A^'^yfor thTmgratmn of vddent to the Patriarch that the League could no , extravagance is people to another country, but he P rob f r ^PfASpealinf pietoe of the f the request put forward would conjure p c PP have been, he esperate plight of the Assyrians in I^aq.

Soon hey would be given instructions as to the ^ .^Snleimania and Diana were iterwards the officers in the levy detachme secret pact to maintain a Iso brought into the scheme, and all entered into a secret pac mited front and obey the Patriarch.30 167. On the 1st June a memorial was presented to the brigadier commanding the Assyrian levies, signed by all but one of the Assyrian officers, stating that they and all the men had decided to cease serving as from the 1 st July. The reason given for this step was that His Majesty s Government had failed adequately to ensure the future of the Assyrian nation after the termina tion of their mandate over Iraq. At the same time it was ascertained that the ^ Mar Shimun, in conjunction with other Assyrian bishops and maliks, was preparing to concentrate the whole Assyrian nation in the Dohuk—Amadiya area at the beginning of July, and that the levies on leaving their service intended to join this concentration. Subsequent action was to be decided at a national conference to be held at Ser Amadiya on the 15th June. What form this action was to take is not known with certainty, but those most closely in touch with the Assyrians believed that the leaders intended to try to coerce His Majesty s Government and the Iraqi Government into creating and recognising an autonomous enclave for the Assyrians in Iraq, or, alternatively, to establish such an enclave by a cou'p de main. It was felt that the existence of such a plan created a situation of the greatest political danger. The Assyrians are well armed with over 3,000 British rifles, and most of the men of fighting age have been trained in the levies. Their concentration in the Dohuk-Amadiya area would have caused tense excitement throughout the Mosul liwa, and would have created an atmosphere in which the flames of religious fanaticism might easily have been set alight on all sides. 168. The High Commissioner summoned a meeting of representative Assyrian officers at the Residency on the 13th June. He warned them that the step which they were taking would alienate British trust and sympathy, and asked them to reconsider their action. He promised that, if they would withdraw their manifesto and give an assurance that they would continue to serve loyally, His Majesty’s Government would overlook their folly and permit them to continue in their service. But if they remained obdurate it would not be long before they would very sincerely regret the course which they had adopted, as this could only lead to disaster. The officers said that they could not withdraw their memorial without the concurrence of the other leaders and that Mar Shimun alone could decide the matter. The High Commissioner accordingly agreed to await a reply until after the meeting which was to take place at Ser Amadiya two days later. 169. This reply was received in Bagdad on the 18th June. It was in the form of a petition addressed to the High Commissioner with a copy for onward transmission to the chairman of the Permanent Mandates Commission signed by all the leading maliks and bishops. After a declaration that the Assyrians had not received from His Majesty’s Government the reward which they had expected for their services, the leaders set forth nine demands, which may be summarised as follows :— ( 1 ) That the Assyrians should be recognised as a millet (nation) domiciled in Iraq, and not merely as an Iraqi religious community. ( 2 ) That the Hakkiari Sanjak in Turkey, in which some of the Assyrians formerly lived, should be annexed to Iraq and its villages restored to the Assyrians. (3) —(a) That, if this could not be done, a national home should be found for the Assyrians which should be open to all the Assyrians scattered in Iraq and to all other ex-Ottoman Assyrians from all over the world. ( 6 ) That this new home should be arranged to include the whole of the Amadiya district and the adjacent parts of the Zakho, Dohuk and Aqra districts, and that it should be made into a sub-liwa under the Mosul liwa with its headquarters at Dohuk under an Arab Mutessarif and a British adviser. (c) -That existing settlement arrangements should be whollv revised by a committee provided with adequate funds, and that the land chosen for Assyrian settlement should be registered in their names as their own property. „ W Thf 1 2 3 * * 6 preference should be given to Assyrians in the selection ot officials tor this sub-liwa.31 i (4) Thtit tliG temporal arid spiritual authority of the l^atriarch over the Assyrian nation should be officially recognised and that an annual subsidy should be given to him. (5) That the Assyrians should have a member in the Chamber of Deputies nominated by the people and the Patriarch. ( 6 ) That the Iraqi Government should establish schools in consultation with the Patriarch in which the language of the Assyrians should be taught. (7) That the League of Nations or the Iraqi Government should make a gift of 5,00,000 rupees for the creation of a church waqf for the Assyrian Church. ( 8 ) That a hospital should be established at the headquarters of the sub-liwa and dispensaries at other places (9) That the rifles earned by the Assyrians by their service in the levies should not be confiscated. 170. It was further stipulated that these demands should be adopted by the Council of the League of Nations and by Royal Iradah made part of the Iraqi Constitution. The petition concluded with an ultimatum that, unless these demands were granted before the 28th June, the levies would not withdraw their resignation and the national movement would increase. 171. On the day following the receipt of this petition the High Commis sioner despatched by air a letter to the Patriarch. He pointed out the impossibility of granting such far-reaching demands within the time stipulated, and urged the Patriarch to enjoin on the Assyrian leaders the postponement of their threatened abandonment of their service in the levies until the petition had been referred to the League of Nations and an answer received. This letter was discussed by Mar Shimun and other leaders at Ser Amadiya on the 19th and 20 th June, and their reply was that they must insist on the acceptance of all their demands, excepting that concerning the Hakkiari, as the condition of the withdrawal of the levy manifesto of the 1 st June. 172. After further negotiations had proved fruitless, arrangements were made for a battalion of British infantry (the 1st Battalion, the Northampton shire Regiment) to be flown by the Royal Air Force from Egypt to take over the duties of the levies until steps could be taken for the recruitment of the special force for the protection of aerodromes provided for in the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930. 173. The first company of the Northamptonshires arrived on the 22nd June, and the transporting of the whole battalion was completed five days later. The four companies were distributed to the levy stations at Mosul, Diana, Suleimani and Hinaidi. 174. Their arrival was not without effect on the Assyrian leaders, and at the last moment Mar Shimun, on the 29th June, consented to issue an encyclical letter to the Assyrian officers and men of the levies enjoining on them continued loyal and obedient service in the force until the national petition of the 17th June had been considered by the League of Nations and an answer given, adding that if they then wished to take their discharge they must do so in avoidance with the orders of their British officers. In consideration of this, the High Commis sioner promised that the levies would be maintained at their present strength until an answer was given to the Assyrian petition, or until the 15th December, whichever was the earlier. He also informed him that certain questions i aise in the petition, such as the recognition of the Patriarch, land settlement, schoo s, dispensaries and the retention of rifles, were recognised by him to be reasonable subjects for consideration, and that the earliest and most sympathetic attention to them would be pressed by him on the Iraqi Government, and through Dis Majesty’s Government, on the League of Nations. 175. The levies at Diana, Suleimani and Mosul submitted without trouble to the injunction of their Patriarch, but those at Hmaidi showe ., , complaisant and for some days behaved in a mutinous mannei. w . advisable to permit the more restless men to go, and for sevei a t ays ^ i of about thirty men took their discharge. In all, some 250 m from service in this manner.32 176. By the end of the first week in July the remaining men in all stations had undertaken to obey the Patriarch’s instructions. The strike of the levies was thus at an end. Arrangements were then made for the gradual return to Egypt of the Northamptonshire battalion, the troops being moved by air via Rutbah and Amman. 177. The next step was to deal with the petition. The High Commissioner communicated to the Iraqi Government an extract showing the principal demands put forward by the Assyrians, and entered into negotiations with them to obtain undertakings to cover such of these demands as appeared reasonable. In particular, he persuaded them to appoint a committee to report on the possibility of finding more land for Assyrian settlement in the qadhas of Amadiya, Dohuk, Zakho and Aqra. 178. This the Iraqi Government agreed to do, and at the High Commissioner’s suggestion a representative Assyrian (a relative of the Patriarch) was made a member of the committee, together with the British Administrative Inspector of the Mosul liwa and the Kaimakam of Dohuk. They reported that there was no vacant land suitable for Assyrian settlement in the Zakho or Aqra qadhas, but that land had been found in several villages in the Dohuk and Amadiya qadhas, in which it was estimated that 130 families could immediately be settled. In addition, they reported that another 200 families could be settled in the Dashtazi area (Amadiya qadha) if the water supply could be improved by a minor irrigation work. 179. The Cabinet immediately adopted this report and instructions were given to the Irrigation Department to prepare a technical report on the Dashtazi irrigation proposal. The engineer’s report was ready early in September. He estimated that at a cost of £13,000 sufficient land could be irrigated in this area to support almost 400 families. 180. The petition itself, together with the observations of His Majesty’s Government and the Iraqi Government, and the findings of the land committee and irrigation engineer, were brought to the notice of the League Council at their 68 th session. It was decided that these documents should be referred to the Permanent Mandates Commission at their next (twenty-second) session in November. 181. In the meantime, King Faisal had visited Amadiya and had given a long audience to Mar Shimun, at which he discussed the Assyrian petition and their future in Iraq. His Majesty seems to have done his utmost to persuade the Patriarch to trust the Iraqi Government, and promised that he wxaild himself watch over their interests and safeguard their rights. Mar Shimun, however, while thanking the King for his kindness, said that he felt obliged to await the result of the petition to the League. Shortly afterwards, his Beatitude left Iraq for Geneva and remained there until the end of December. 182. Early in September another Assyrian petition was received for onward transmission to the League of Nations. This was signed by a number of minor chiefs who claimed to represent a total of about 2,400 families. They repudiated the recent activities of the Patriarch and the petition of the 17th June, and declared their entire satisfaction with their present circumstances and their loyalty to the Iraqi Government. The signatories to this petition were mainly the people of Barwari Bala, headed by their bishop, Mar Yuwalaha. These people are still living in their original villages, cultivating their old lands, and have not the same reasons for discontent as the Tiair and T’khuma tribesmen and the others whose old homes are in Turkey. 183. This petition, together with that of the 17th June, was examined by the Permanent Mandates Commission at their autumn session early in November. The report of the sub-committee to which they were referred, while rejecting the demand which had been made for political autonomy, emphasised the opinion that the only solution of the Assyrian problem was to settle them in a homogeneous body in a region suitable to their requirements, and declared that proof had not yet been given that such a region did not exist in Iraq. The commission, in their conclusions, adopted this report and drew the attention of the Council to the importance of the Iraqi Government’s finding a means to assure to the Assyrians a homogeneous settlement which would satisfy their needs.33 [8744] D 184. This resolution came before the Council during the 69th session in November. A sub-committee, consisting of the United Kingdom, French and Italian delegates, was formed to prepare a report. The spirit of the Council and of the French and Italian representatives, influenced by the pro-Assyrian views of the president of the Permanent Mandates Commission, was markedly sympathetic to the Assyrians and openly suspicious of the British standpoint. A suggestion was made that the Iraqi Government should accept a League Commissioner to make an enquiry into the whole question of finding land for the homogeneous settlement of the Assyrians in Iraq. To this the Iraqi Government refused to agree, nor would they accept an alternative proposal that they should appoint a representative of the Nansen Office to co-operate with them in carrying out their own scheme for settling the Assyrians. The utmost that they could be persuaded to do was to undertake to appoint an expert from outside Iraq to assist them in the settlement of all landless inhabitants of Iraq, including the Assyrians. In the end, after a prolonged discussion, the Council gave way on this point and a resolution was passed unanimously in the following terms :— “ The Council, “ In conformity with the proposal submitted by the committee charged, by its decision of the 5th December, 1932, to prepare a draft resolution regarding the question of the Assyrian community of Iraq in the light of the report of the Permanent Mandates Commission of the 14th November, 1932 ; C£ Adopts the view of the Permanent Mandates Commission that the demand of the Assyrians for administrative autonomy within Iraq cannot be accepted; “ Notes with satisfaction the declaration by the representative of Iraq of the intention of the Iraqi Government to select from outside Iraq a foreign expert to assist them for a limited period in the settlement of all landless inhabitants of Iraq, including Assyrians, and in the carrying out of their scheme for the settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq under suitable conditions and, so far as may be possible, in homogeneous units, it being understood that the existing rights of the present population shall not be prejudiced; “ Feels confident that, if these measures do not provide a complete solution of the problem, and there remain Assyrians unwilling, or unable, to settle in Iraq, the Iraqi Government will take all such measures as may be possible to facilitate the settlement of the said Assyrians elsewhere; “ Requests the Iraqi Government to be so good as to keep it informed in due course of the result of the foregoing measures.” The Kurds. 185. One of the provisions of the Local Languages Law was that, in the Kurdish qadhas of the Mosul liwa, the people were to choose, within one year from the coming into force of the law, the type of Kurdish language which they desired to use. Delegates from their qadhas met at the Mosul liwa headquarters and, by 7 votes to 2, they resolved that the indigenous Bahdinain dialect should be adopted as the official language of their qadhas. 186. The year was quite free from any manifestations of Kurdish Nationalist agitation and, provided the Iraqi Government continue their present policy in dealing with the Kurdish districts, there is no reason to anticipate that the Kurdish question will again become acute for some years. 187. In August the King, accompanied by the Crown Prince, visited Suleimani and Arbil and some of the Kurdish districts of the Mosul liwa. Everywhere he was given a most cordial welcome, and his unfailing personal charm won general approbation even among the habitual cavillers. 188. The Pizhder area to the east of Rania has not yet been brought under control and no step in this direction was taken during the year. Probably the best method of penetration would be gradually to build roads. Experience in Halabja and in the Shirwan and Barzan areas has already shown their great value as a civilising influence.34 The Yazidis. 189. Throughout 1931 there was a marked restlessness among th e^zidis of the Jabal Sinjar. The basic cause was dissatisfaction with the management of the revenues collected by their religious head, or Mir, baid eg, a immoral private life. In October the local authorities of e os gathered together a committee of Tazidi chiefs, lay and spin u , endeavoured to obtain from them rulings on a number of ques ions conceim g the religious and social organisation of the community It was hoped witn tne help of this information to draw up a law regulating Yazidi affairs similai to those which had already been, created for other religious communities. 1 ie committee’s replies were by no means helpful. For example, they gave e opinion that there was no way of deposing an unsatisfactory Mil excep )y assassinating him. Nevertheless the mutessarif and the Administrative Inspectoi set about their difficult task of framing a law which would give legal sanction to the more civilised of the accepted customs of the community. In the meanwhi e the leaders of the anti-Said Beg faction took matters into their own hands and set up a rival Mir, whom they installed in the Sinjar. The Government refrained from intervention, and were content to watch the situation and to wain all concerned that they would permit no breach of the peace. Their attitude was soon justified by later events. The Sinjar Yazidis quickly tired of their new puppet Mir, and before the end of the summer of 1932 three other rival claimants had come forward, each appealing for official support for his candidature. Many conflicting petitions from the different groups were also addressed to the High Commissioner, and the internal affairs of the community were still in a somewhat chaotic state at the end of the year. The Iraqi Government continued to await a favourable opportunity to provide them with the means better to regulate their affairs, but it is doubtful if the chiefs really desire this to be done. 190. In November 1931 three of the Sinjar chiefs, Hammu Shari, Sheikh Khalaf and Sheikh Khidr, sent a petition to the League of Nations asking that in the event of the British mandate being terminated their country should be included within the French boundary. When, however, the League Boundary Commission visited the Sinjar in the spring of 1932, these chiefs changed their minds and declared summarily for inclusion in Iraq. Their petition, together with the observations of Flis Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, was considered by the Permanent Mandates Commission at their 22nd session in November 1932. The Arab Congress. 191. The idea of holding an Arab Congress in Bagdad was first discussed in the local press in the early days of the summer. About the same time the King mentioned to the High Commissioner that it was likely to take place in the autumn. King Faisal’s supporters advocated Bagdad as a venue for the Congress, but adherents of Ibn Saud favoured Mecca, and others, under the influence of Abbas Hilmi, the ex-Khedive, preferred Geneva. The Congress did not, in fact, take place during the year under review. Nevertheless King Faisal from the beginning was strongly in favour of the proposal, especially for a meeting in Bagdad. In November he sent Yasin Pasha to Jerusalem, Cairo and Damascus to enlist the support of the Arab leaders. In Cairo His Majesty’s proposals met with little support. In Jerusalem the majority of the Palestinian Arab Nationalists were favourable to the idea, but elements 1 under the influence of Ibn Saud and Abbas Hilmi continued respectively to advocate the advantages either of Mecca or of a Luropean centre, such as Geneva. In Damascus Yasin Pasha was unable to obtain unanimous support for the choice of Bagdad as the meeting place. b The Barzan Operations. , 192. One of the major problems confronting the Iraqi Government at the beginning of the year was that of pacifying the Shirwan and Barzan districts As already reported in the annual report for 1931, the outbreak in the previous summer of a private war based on a long-standing feud between Sheikh Ahmad of Barzan and Sheikh Rashid, of Baradost, had caused serious disorders which the Iraqi Government had not, up to the end of 1931, been able to quell ’ Earlyfl'IS) 35 [8744] ~ P 2 in the year under review it was decided that, as soon as the weather permitted and the necessary preparations could be completed, a strong force of the Iraqi army should be sent to occupy the whole area by stages, and that after military control had been obtained a regular civil administration should be set up supported by an adequate force of police. As the authority of the Iraqi Govern- ^ment had never been effectively established in this area, it was anticipated that Sheikh Ahmad would offer strong opposition to the penetration of the country over which he had for so long exercised independent tribal control, and at the request of the Iraqi Government it was agreed that the Royal Air Force should co-operate fully with the Iraqi troops in the operations. Detailed reports on these operations have been made both by Air Vice-Marshal Sir E. R. Ludlow- Hewitt, the Air Officer Commanding the Iraq Command, and by Major-General H. Rowan-Robinson, the Inspector-General of the Iraqi Army, and it is not necessary to do more than to outline briefly the course of events. 193. Weather conditions in the mountainous area of the north of Iraq, in which the operations were to be undertaken, made it impossible to begin military movements before the middle of March, but by the 15th of that month the necessary forces had been concentrated and the army was ready to take the offensive. One last effort was, however, made to deal with the situation without recourse to force. On the 12th March a letter from the Minister for the Interior was delivered to Sheikh Ahmad of Barzan informing him of the Government’s intention to establish a regular administration throughout the whole of the country in which he had hitherto occupied a special position, and summoning him to meet the kaimakam of the Zibar qadha at Billeh before the 14th March in order to receive from him the orders of the Government. He was promised that if, after hearing these orders, he felt unable to accept them, he would be free to return whence he had come, but he was warned at the same time that if he refused to meet the kaimakam the Government would take whatever steps they thought fit to deal with him. Simultaneously, a letter from the High Commissioner was delivered to him advising him to obey the Iraqi Government and warning him that the British Government, while wishing him well, would fully support the Iraqi Government if he resisted their authority. 194. It was intended that if Sheikh Ahmad came to Billeh, the kaimakam should inform him that for the present the Government required him to reside in Mosul, and to assure him that if he obeyed their orders he would be allowed to continue to enjoy the possession of his legitimate properties in Barzan. Had he met the kaimakam and accepted this offer, both he and his people would have been saved much avoidable suffering. He refused, however, to come to the appointed place, and sent an oral reply that he would not surrender to the Iraqi Government. 195. The overture for a peaceful settlement having thus failed, the troops began to move. The main force, consisting of a cavalry regiment, a mountain battery, three infantry battalions and one machine-gun platoon, 200 police and two wireless sections, which had been concentrated at the eastern end of the Rowanduz Gorge, advanced on the 15th March into the Shirwan area. Mergasur, a dominating point, was occupied without opposition on the following day, and the column, having repelled a heavy night attack on the 19th March, remained camped there until the end of the month. On the 30th March the advance was continued, and on the morning of the 3rd April, on approaching the village of Berisia, the main body of the column was attacked in exceedingly difficult country. The advance guard had gone ahead too quickly and had lost touch with the column, and the Barzanis, having thrown the main body into disorder, delivered a heavy attack on the transport of the column. The British officers, exerting themselves to the utmost, rallied their men and saved the situation, while the Royal Air Force, who had brought every available machine into action, beat off the enemy with repeated bombing and machine-gun attacks from the air. Some of the senior Iraqi officers, including the commander of the column, completely lost their heads, and in certain cases showed deplorable cowardice; but the younger officers and the men responded well when given a steady lead by the British officers, who were, in the circumstances, compelled to take command. 196. The casualties in the action were 11 other ranks killed, 4 officers and 45 other ranks wounded, and 4 other ranks missing. I he transport losses were36 also heavy. Nearly 400 mules were lost, and with them 1 a [^ blankets, ammunition and other supplies. Major-Genera j d a day British Inspector-General of the Iraqi Army, was also himself wounded a day later in making an endeavour to get through to the column PP wag the next few days the troops suffered severely from cold and h | relieved to some extent by the large quantities of foo an n t bv^ Royal Air Force dropped on the column two days after ^ y which time it had reached Berisia without meeting wi u_ fnllowing On the 5th April it was decided to take the offensive again. pr , PTTlv ou day, therefore, the force at Berisia, known as Dicol attacked^the enemy on the high ground towards Zazhok, and with the assistance o a &lt; ‘ Mergasur and the splendid co-operation of the Royal ^ ir ° f lC 7 i i nncnli severelv. For the remainder of April “ Dicol” remained at Zazhok, consoli dating control over the neighbouring district. I he enemy con mec en ac i\i ics to sniping. During this period troops from Aqra were pushed forward to the Greater Zab at Billeh, where a second column, with the name of Bazcol was formed, consisting of two infantry battalions, one mountain battery and one wireless section. On the 18th April ££ Bazcor’ occupied Barzan village, the sheikh’s winter headquarters, without resistance, and b)' the end of the month it had established control over the whole of the Zab Valley up to the mountain massif of the Chia-i-Shirin. 197. On the 18th April a conference was held at the Residency to consider the situation. The conclusion was reached that, in view of the stout resistance which was being offered by Sheikh Ahmad, it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the Iraqi troops to complete the subjection of Sheikh Ahmad’s territory before winter set in. Accordingly, at the request of the Iraqi Government, the Air Officer Commanding undertook to organise intensive air operations over the exceedingly difficult and mountainous country to the north-east of the Chia-i- Shirin. 198. It was agreed that the objective of these operations would not be to cause casualties or to destroy villages, but by interrupting the normal life of the tribesmen and by harassing them continually, to force them to abandon their resistance to the authority of the Government. 199. This objective, it was resolved, should be made clear to the tribesmen themselves, and proclamations were accordingly widely distributed from aircraft, warning them that, with effect from the night of the 27th-28th April, their villages and flocks were liable to be attacked at any moment at the discretion of the Government, and advising them to remove their flocks and families to places of safety. They were informed that air operations would be continued against them until their leader had submitted to the Government. 200 . The full execution of the Royal Air Force plan was, however, delayed for a short time by the capture by the enemy of a flying officer and his mechanic, whose machine was forced to the ground with engine trouble during a recon naissance over hostile country. I he flying officer was injured, but his mechanic was unhurt. They were treated well, and Sheikh Ahmad sent a safe conduct for a doctor to visit them. A Royal Air Force medical officer was thereupon sent up to the sheikh s headquarters in the mountain complex beyond the Chia-i-Shirin, and the oppoitunity was taken to send with him the oriental secretary from the Residency, in the hope that he might be able to persuade the sheikh to release his prisoners. They received a courteous and hospitable reception, and were able to return to Bagdad with the two airmen on the 5th May. During this visit ° r !f nta i “7 to discuss the general situation with Sheikh Ahmad and his brothers, Mulla Mustafa and Mulla Sadiq, and in return for the release of the prisoners, undertook that the intensive air operations over the to^emade^ W ° UM 6 SUSpended for a short P eriod to enable a new peace effort ., O n his return to Bagdad, the terms which could be offered to Shaikh Ahmad were discussed, and it was decided to promise Sheikh Ahmad and his brothers honourable treatment and adequate allowances for their maintenance if he would surrender within a fixed period of a few davs A wLI. i ” ? these terms was delivered to Sheikh Ahmad on the 21st May, in which k wasMso[8744] D 3 37 stated that he and his brothers and their families would be required to live at a place to be fixed by the Government. He was given until the 24th May to reply to this offer, and was warned that if he did not accept it, the armistice which had been granted at the time of the release of his two prisoners would be terminated, and operations against him would be resumed everywhere at the ^discretion of the Government. The sheikh’s final reply to this communication was a laconic message that any more messengers would be shot. 202. In the meantime, “ Dicol,” operating in the Shirwan area, which had been excluded from the armistice, had advanced to the Rukuchuk, and had established a number of posts along this river, with a view to reducing the area over which the Royal Air Force would have to act. 203. On the 25th May intensive air operations were resumed, and incessant activity was maintained night and day over the enemy country, with the object of interrupting the normal life of the villages, and of keeping all men with their families pinned down in the caves in which they had taken shelter from aerial attack. The aircraft were, however, constantly fired on, and one Wapiti, with pilot and mechanic, was shot down and lost. The air operations were entirely successful, with the result that on the 14th June “ Dicol ” crossed the Rukuchuk without opposition, and occupied the important village of Shirwan-i-Mazin. On the 20th June the troops, with Royal Air Force co-operation, advanced towards Zaita, where Sheikh Ahmad appeared to be preparing to make a last stand. He did not, however, stay to fight, and on the 22nd June he crossed the border with about 300 followers and surrendered to the Turks, who, during the latter stages of the operations, had, at the request of the Iraqi Government, sent troops to the frontier to co-operate if necessary with the Iraqi columns. The surrender of Sheikh Ahmad brought the operations to an end. The police took over from the military as soon as posts could be built for their accommodation, and normal civil administration was rapidly installed throughout the whole area of operations. 204. Sheikh Ahmad and his brothers were removed into the interior of Anatolia, but, after a short detention, the remainder of his followers were set free, and most of them returned to their villages in a pitiable state of want and destitution. They were permitted to go to their homes without hindrance, and the Government wisely refrained from any attempt to punish them for taking part in the fighting. A few minor leaders, however, remained at large in inaccessible villages on the border, and continued up to the close of the year to be something of a menace to the peace of the newly-occupied districts. Late in December they were joined by Muhammad Sadiq, one of Sheikh Ahmad’s brothers, and he and his followers had a brush with the police, in which they lost one man killed. 205. The Barzan villages were left sadly impoverished by the struggle. Many had not harvested their crops and had made no preparations for the next harvest. The Government voted a sum of 1,200 Iraqi dinars for relief measures, but it is doubtful whether this sum was sufficient appreciably to alleviate the hardships which winter soon brought upon them. Minor Tribal Disturbances. 206. Apart from the Barzan operations, the Iraqi army were not called upon to undertake any major punitive operations against the tribes. Ihe police force, however, had on several occasions to deal with minor tribal disoideis. ^ A brief 'description of the principal events of this kind is given in the following paragraphs. 207. About the middle of January fighting broke out between two sections of the Majawir tribe, a few miles distant from Diwaniya. Police sent to separate the combatants and restore order were set on and attacked by both sides. In the fight which ensued the police dispersed the tribesmen, but lost two men and ten horses killed and three men were slightly wounded. The tribal casualties were eight killed and one wounded. On the following day the police destroyed the huts of both sections and no further fighting occurred.38 208. In July Sheikh Shahab of another tribal chieftain conflict'with the local authorities thioug fl j j j | e (, a vioui led to an order about the ownership of a village. |l high-handed l»e hills to the west being issued for his arrest, and he fl f d f take over a number of of Aqra.

The rest of the party thereupon withdrew dishearte^ following day police reinforcements were hurried to the scene and the tnbesmen dispersed. No punishment had, however, been inflicted on them before the end of the year. Justice. 210. The Judicial Agreement ratified on the 29th May, 1931, was imple mented by the appointment of nine British legal experts. Of this number five were already serving in the country and four new appointments to judgeships were made, viz., Messrs. Creed, Good, Campbell and 0 Meara. At the end of the year the new judges had not been given formal contracts, nor had the contiacts oi the old judges been extended, but negotiations to this end were in progress. The distribution of these nine British legal experts was as follows Judicial adviser to the Ministry of Justice : Mr. Grower. President of the Court of Appeal: Mr. Alexander. President of the Court of Sessions at Bagdad: Mr. Prichard. President of the Court of Sessions at Basra: Mr. Lloyd. President of the Court of Sessions at Mosul: Mr. Weldon. President of the Court of Sessions at Kirkut: Mr. Creed. 211 . It was proposed that Messrs. Good and O’Meara should become presidents respectively at Baguba and Hillah, but by the end of the year their appointments had not been gazetted. For the present Mr. Campbell is being retained in Bagdad as personal assistant to Mr. Grower. 212. The presidents of the courts of sessions are responsible for the distribu tion and supervision of judicial business within their districts, and are also ipso facto presidents of the execution departments. It will thus be seen that the British element in the judiciary is in a position to supervise effectively the work of the courts. 213. As regards the standard of justice maintained during the year under review, no occasion arose in which it was necessary to make official representations to the Iraqi Government. The working of the criminal courts appears to be generally satisfactory. The lesser criminal magistrates are all Iraqis, but no case has come to light during the year which would justify an indictment of their general efficiency. Difficult criminal cases are sometimes delayed and hampered39 by inexpert police prosecution, but since the establishment of a public prosecutor attached to the Ministry of Justice, the standard of Crown prosecutions should improve. Generally speaking, civil litigation is more likely to produce abuses and anomalies, but this is due not so much to inefficiency on the part of the civil judges as to the law which they are called upon to administer. Most of the civil and commercial law is Ottoman in origin, an incubus which an overworked Parliament can only gradually remove. 214. The standing of the legal profession in Iraq is still far from what it might be, but there are signs of progress. A proposal to form a Bar Association has been mooted. Both judges and the advocates appearing before them are now robed, an innovation which has added to the dignity and decorum of the courts. The courts themselves are still wretchedly housed, but it is to be feared that some time will elapse before the Government will be ready to vote money for the building of new Courts of Justice. 215. The year 1932 did not mark any appreciable advance towards the solution of the problem of the Bahai houses, the main nope of achieving a settlement of this long-outstanding grievance now rests on the execution of an ambitious town-planning scheme, which will involve the whole quarter on the right bank of the Tigris in which the Bahai houses are situated. Although this scheme has the backing and approval of King Faisal, the means for financing it are not yet to hand, and it is impossible to forecast a probable date upon which work will start. The Iraqi Government are, however, committed to proceed at first with that part of the scheme which affects the area surrounding the houses. It has become evident, however, that, in the minds of some Iraqi Ministers, the opportunity of using the scheme as an excuse for the demolition of the houses has not been lost sight of. Such action would, of course, arouse bitter resentment amono- the Bahais, and would be out of harmony with the many assurances given by King Faisal and past Prime Ministers. No opportunity was lost of impressing these considerations upon the Iraqi Government. 216. In January 1932 the Acting Prime Minister (Jafar Pasha), in a letter dated the 19th January, 1932, informed Sir Francis Humphrys that— “ The Iraqi Government have under consideration at present a Bagdad town-planning scheme, and they have directed the expert who has been charged with the preparation of a plan for this scheme to include the area surrounding the Bahai houses among the piopeities which should be expropriated for the purpose of public benefit. Jhe plan has been di awn up as recommended by the Government, and I forward herewith a copy thereof for your Excellency’s information.” This plan showed an open space in which the Bahai houses would stand. 217. In February 1932 the Prime Minister (Nuri Pasha) met Mr. Mountford Mills (the representative of the Bahai community), and showed to him the plan nf Sir Francis Humphrvs, explaining that it was the intention oie Pm f.Vt a fit.h November. 1932, the matter was raised at Geneva during The Bahai Houses. r of the project. [8744]wmm 40 scheme was dependent on the development of the town-planning scheme. He also stated that the Iraqi Government had undertaken to prevent the alteiation or demolition of the houses. Education. tk 219. There was a marked increase throughout Iraq dining the yeai in the demand for the education of both sexes. Applicants for admission to many schools had to be turned away for lack of accommodation. 220. No progress was made in regard to the scheme for the establishment of an educational institution on English public school lines. Iraqi students are, however, prepared for the London Matriculation Examination at the Central Secondary School in Bagdad. 221. On the 6 th February an American Educational Commission visited Bagdad at the invitation of the Iraqi Government for the purpose of indicating the principles on which a progressive educational policy could be based, i his commission was headed by Dr. Paul Monroe, director of the International Institute of Teachers, Columbia University, New York. 222. As a result of their recommendations, the following changes were made in October : — (a) The latter part of the secondary school course was made to facilitate specialisation and preparation for the liberal profession, engineering, agriculture and commerce. (b) A Rural Agricultural School for adolescents was opened at Hillah, and an agricultural section established at the Men’s Training College, Bagdad. (c) A School of Domestic Economy was established in Bagdad. (d) Fifty new rural schools were opened for boys and girls. 223. The commission’s report formed the subject of keen criticism in the Iraqi press, mainly on the alleged ground that it made no practical recommenda tions for the employment of pupils who had completed the secondary school course. 224. In April a Teachers’ Conference was held at Bagdad under the patronage of His Majesty King Faisal, and was attended by 70 per cent, of the Iraqi teaching profession, and served generally to improve their moral. 225. Permission was granted during the year to Father Edmund A. Walsh, S.J., vice-president of Georgetown University, Washington, D.C to open a Catholic secondary school, conforming in its general lines to’similar Iraqi Government schools. ^ IV-—Internal Affairs (Economic). (A) Finance. Budget Estimates for 1932-33. 226. Following the excellent precedent set during the preceding year the Government successfully secured the passage of the 1932 budget Sates through Parliament before the beginning of the financial year and thereby determined he broad lines of their financial policy sufficiently ’in advance to allow the policy to be properly developed throughout the year. * aavance t0 227 Ihe draft estimates were considered by the Council of Ministers during January and February, were placed before Parlinment in f- vll ? lst . ers of March and passed into law on the 31st March 1932 h be S lnmn g 4he continuance of the a^ricultnpfil nnri ■ j effect of the concessions r a and economic depression and the o„ ,1. . G =.x“ Srs sx ss41 from taxation on agricultural and natural produce. The amount provided in the estimates for receipts from this source was only 35 per cent, of the average amount realised in the more prosperous years before the slump. To offset this further fall, the estimates of all spending departments were again carefully pruned, and the cut in the salaries of non-contractual employees and in pensions (introduced as a temporary measure for one year from the 1 st April, 1931) was extended to cover the whole of the new financial year. These measures, however, were insufficient to balance the estimates, and they were placed before Parliament, showing a deficit of approximately 8 lakhs of rupees. In accordance with the declared policy of segregating the receipts from oil revenues for expenditure upon capital works and development, none of these receipts was made available for normal supply services. 229. While the estimates were receiving the consideration of Parliament, a draft Customs Tariff Law was presented by the Government as an urgent measure and passed into law immediately. This provided for a general increase in the rate of customs duty on imported goods for the purpose of providing the additional revenue necessary to stabilise the estimates. 230. With the introduction of the new Iraqi currency on the 1 st April, the figures in the estimates were converted from r.upee into dinar currency, 1 dinar being equal to £1 sterling. 231. The estimates, as finally approved, including the additional revenue anticipated from the enhanced rate of customs duty, were as follows Iraqi dinars. the effect being that of a balanced budget, leaving the special receipts from oil concessionnaires available for development purposes.

The activities of the Government the civil service necessitated an additional credit of 2-3 lakhs of rupees (bl7,Jo ) for pensions and gratuities to discharged personnel, and an additional amoun had also to be added to the vote for compensation to British omcials whose contracts were terminated. A sum of 6 2 lakhs of rupees (£46,500) was also made available for payment as grant-in-aid to the larger municipalities. 234. Taking the supplementary credits into account, a deficit of 25 lakhs of rupees (£187,500) was anticipated on the year. The actual deficit proved to be 21,71,646 rupees (£152,825). Revenue fell some 24 lakhs of rupees below the estimates, but this was more than counterbalanced by savings of 27|- lakhs of rupees which finally appeared on the expenditure side. 235.

The following table shows how, gauged by the test of revenue collections, the prosperous period may be said to have reached its crest in the year 1928-29, a slight decline occurring in the following year a slump in 1930-3144 of tax imposed with effect from the 1 st April, 1931, when the rate of taxation was raised from 3-65 per cent, to 9 per cent. No alteration was made during the year in the basis of taxation which is as under :— A further law which was designed to improve the administration of the tax was drafted, and accepted by the Cabinet in May 1932, but has not yet passed into law. The figure of estimated receipts during the financial year 1932-33 is £150,000, but only £55,000 had been collected up to the 31st December, 1932. It is doubtful whether the tax is really operative to any extent upon other than the income of the Government official and the profits and salaries of the few European firms operating in the country. 238. In June 1931 the Iraqi Government, impressed with the necessity of assisting agriculture, and by the need for reform in the system of taxation of agricultural produce, passed a law which changed the entire method of land taxation. The law, No. 83 of 1931, entitled “ Law for the Collection of Duty (‘ Rassum-al-Istihlak ) on Land Produce,introduced a system whereby the assessment of revenue upon the products of the land available at harvest time is abolished and taxation is only levied upon that part of the produce which is taken to market or exported. This change relieves the cultivator of the necessity of paying tax upon the produce grown for his own consumption, and eliminates the complicated system of variable assessments, based upon area and land tenure. Rental is charged for occupied Government lands, and a water rate is levied upon land watered by flow irrigation. This method was applied, by notification of the Minister of Finance, to all winter produce, vegetables, fruit and tobacco, with effect from the 1 st April, 1932, and to the summer crops of dates and rice from the 10 th August and the 15th September, 1932, respectively. It is doubtful whether the fear that the change might bring about a serious reduction in revenue receipts will be fulfilled. By the end of the calendar year the receipts were up to estimates and showed an improvement of 50 per cent, over those of the preceding year, but these signs may do no more than reflect the better prices obtained for the harvest of 1932 and smaller collections resulting from the extensive remissions and refunds granted in the year of agricultural distress, 1931. The date crop is particularly suited to the istihlak method, and the receipts from this may counterbalance any falling-off in the revenue from purely agricultural produce. The change in system has generally given satisfaction to the tax-payer and should eventually bring easement to the over-worked revenue official. Its financial effect cannot be adequately studied until the financial year 1932 has run its course and complete accounts are available. First £150 of income free of tax. Next £150 of income is taxed at the rate of 6 per cent. Income in excess of £300 is taxed at the rate of 9 per cent. r Revision of Method of Taxation of Produce. Land Settlement. 239. The peculiar fluidity and diversity of methods of land tenure in Iraq has always been realised as presenting a formidable obstacle in the way of planned agricutural development in Iraq. In his exhaustive and valuable report upon Lana ! p.n.v.rp. ana hfplntea —ui* i i • a ^ I J K...45 4 - Tj 116 ® British officers of the Administrative Inspectorate were transferred to the Ministry of Finance, in order to give effect to the Land Settle ment I olicy, as defined in the law, and after carrying out preliminary work in the mis try, they were appointed Land Settlement Officers of three specially-chosen ruial districts near Bagdad. Their duties comprise the definition and categonsation of lands and their ownership, the confirmation and determination o ownership of all rights in land and the delimitation of boundaries throughout the area. Satisfactory progress was reported in each area by the end of the year, and a considerable step forward has therefore been taken on the path of constiuctive reform towards the goal of a uniform and scientific system of land tenure. National Currency. 2 i 41 i Jhe position at the beginning of the year 1932 was that a Currency Law had been passed introducing a national currency linked to sterling, but that the operation of the law had been suspended until monetary conditions stabilised themselves and the future of sterling became clearer. On reviewing the situation at the beginning of the year, and after taking the advice of the members of the Currency Board in London, the Government decided that the comparative steadiness of sterling would justify the change being made with effect from the 1 st April, 1932, and a Royal Iradah was issued notifying this. The local apprehensions of the effect of the change which had made themselves felt and had been sedulously fostered in certain quarters during the previous year had been substantially allayed by careful propaganda on the part of the Government, and the change was effected smoothly wuthout any noticeable disorganisation. The reception of the new currency was, on the whole favourable, and in commercial circles it was accepted, if not with enthusiasm, at least with benevolent acquiescence. The change over was greatly facilitated by the fact that the Government were able to fix the official conversion rate at 75 fils, or Is. 6 d. ( 1,000 fils equalling a dinar, the equivalent of a pound) to the rupee, which reduced the labour of computation. By the end of the year the amount of Iraqi currency in circulation was a little more than 2 million Iraqi dinars, which is two-thirds only of the figure of 3 million Iraqi dinars estimated to be the value of rupee currency circulating in Iraq. There is still a quantity of rupee currency in circulation in Iraq, and the habit of quoting in rupees in the bazaar dies hard. This is aided to some extent by the fact that the populace, whose dealings are in small monetary amounts, still think in annas, for which there is no exact equivalent in the new currency, the exchange value being between 4 and 5 fils. In the small purchases of the average householder this is an important considera tion, and it is not unknown for the wages of an Iraqi labourer, paid in the new currency, to be changed immediately into rupee currency. This is probably only a temporary phase which will right itself in time. To some extent this was foreseen, and the 4-fils coin of the same shape and size as the anna was issued in the hope that it would replace the latter as the monetary unit of the poorer classes, but this attempt to reduce the cost of living has not met with marked success.

The Five-Year Capital Works Programme which the Iraqi Govern ment passed into law rather hurriedly in June 1931 in order to hypothecate the anticipated revenue from advance oil royalties and dead rent, lagged behind the schedule during 1932. One reason for this is the fact that the whole of the first ^ cash payment received in August 1931, and a large part of the payment received in January 1932, was used to finance the accumulated deficit on the Government accounts. The expenditure contemplated in the Capital Development Works budget during the financial year 1931-32 was 50,55,500 rupees (£376,634), but less than half of this sum was spent, chiefly on roads and minor projects. The estimated expenditure for the financial year 1932-33 is £750,000 (including £262,500 on the Habbaniyah Escape), but the total expenditure, again chiefly on roads and minor projects, up to the 31st December, 1932, was £206,000 only. It is generally agreed that the Capital Works Development Law in its original form will need to be extensively revised. The real purpose for which the law was designed—to safeguard the special oil receipts for development and to prevent them from being appropriated for budget-balancing purposes—appears to have been achieved. In the meantime, however, the important Habbaniyah project, of which details are contained in the following paragraph, is taking shape. Particulars are also given below of the extent of the other two irrigation schemes of major importance in the law. Irrigation Schemes of Major Importance in the Capital Works Programme. Habbaniyah Escape Project. 243. In the late Sir William Willcocks’s report of pre-war days to the Turkish Government recommending certain irrigation schemes for the regenera tion of Iraq he placed on the top of the list of works to be done the Hindiyah barrage, on the Euphrates, near Hillah, and the Habbaniyah escape, on the right bank of the Euphrates between Ramadi and Fallujah. Messrs. Sir John Jackson (Limited) built the Hindiyah barrage and began the Habbaniyah work before the war, but ceased their operations at the outbreak of war. The Habbaniyah scheme is revived by article 5 of the Capital Works and Development Law, which authorised the Ministry of Finance to call for tenders for the scheme within five years. The primary object of this scheme is to provide an escape for the spring flood of the Euphrates by diverting it into the Habbaniyah Lake, situated on the right bank of the kuphrates at the upper end of the cultivable lands, and also, if necessary, into a second and larger depression lying to the south of the Habbaniyah Lake known as the Bahr-al-Milh and the Abu Dibis. During the flood the water could then be controlled and the river level kept to a definite and convenient maximum south of Ramadi, thus reducing the considerable damage which, uncontrolled, it causes year by year. The secondary object of the scheme is to store the water thus diverted into the Habbaniyah Lake and to utilise it for the augmentation of tne supply of the Euphrates when the river is low in summer time, the season which yields the most valuable crops. 244. The scheme now provides for three channels, one at Ramadi from the river to the north edge of the Habbaniyah Lake, one from the lake to the second depression and one from the south-west corner of the Habbaniyah Lake to the river. Each channel is to have a control work made in concrete, but the main feature of the scheme is its earthwork, about 10 million cubic metres of earth having to be excavated, most of it of a hard nature. The estimated cost of the whole work is from £1 million to £ 1 ^ million sterling. a -j 24 ?'w mee ^ m f of Council of Ministers on the 18th October, 1931, decided that a call for tenders should be published. In April 1932 the council appointed Messrs. Coode, Wilson, Mitchell and Vaughan-Lee, consulting engineers, of Victoria Street, London, to be their consultants for the scheme The invitation to tender was issued on the 13th October, 1932. It was published m the Iraqi Government Official Gazette and in engineering newspapers in about eight different countries. Persons desiring to tender could obtain copies of the contract documents from the Ministry of Economics and Communications Bagdad, or from the consulting engineers m London, betwen the 1 st November and the 1 st December, 1932, upon payment of 15 Iraqi dinars and deposit ofro 0 !!/!l K 1 ,i uuk ‘t Cash ' ’ J ® nde , rs were t0 , be submitted to the Ministry in Bagc a by t ic Ibth January, 1933, but this period was subsequently extended bv one month to the 16th February, 1933, in response to representations that the time allowed was insufficient. Ihe contract terms stipulated that tenders would only be accepted from firms of contractors who have previously executed works of a similar nature Representatives of contractors had already been making enquiries regarding the scheme in Bagdad during the winter of 1931, and it wa! clear that Ijeen international competition was to be expected. In the event ten applicants had actually applied for and obtained the contract documents by the latest date for application laid down. Of them, four are British firms; one is Anglo-Egyptian one Anglo-German; one French; one an international group, including Fiench, German and British interests; and two are Italian Tenders were invited on two bases :— {a) The Government paying the contractor as the work proceeds, and ( 6 ) Ihe Government paying in cash to the extent of 30 per cent, and the remainder in bonds bearing a fixed rate of interest and due to be redeemed in a fixed period. 246. By the end of the j^ear the Iraqi Government had not definitely decided by what means they would finance the work, though they were inclined to operate the contract on basis (a). The Abu Ghuraib Canal. 247 The second irrigation work of importance to be taken in hand under the Law for Capital Development Works was the Abu Ghuraib Canal. This canal is often treated as if it were part of the Habbaniyah project, because at one time the Iraqi Government intended to put both works in the hands of the same contractor. The two works are, however, quite distinct. The Abu Ghuraib scheme is of comparatively minor importance to contractors and others, the total cost being in the neighbourhood of £150,000. The alignment takes off from the left bank of the Euphrates about 6 miles below Fallujah and runs towards Bagdad, the tails almost reaching the farm of King Faisal at Harthiyah. The canal is a new one, but replaces an ancient one that watered the same area. It is 40 miles in length, and is expected to water about 120,000 acres. In July 1932 the Council of Ministers allotted 15,000 dinars to start work on the Abu Ghuraib, and an invitation to tender for a portion of the easier excavation work was issued in August, whilst a section of the excavation of the head-reach of the canal, which was heavier work, was entrusted to jail labour. The contract was awarded to an Iraqi firm, and work began in November. Tigris Barrage at Kut. 248. The third irrigation work provided for in the Capital Development Works Law is the Kut (or Gharraf) barrage. It is part of another of the Willcocks pre-war schemes. The proposal is to construct a barrage across the Tigris at Kut in order to divert the water as required down the Shatt-el-Gharraf (or Shatt-el-Hai) Channel. This branch of the river runs southwards towards Nasiriyah on the Euphrates, and is believed capable of irrigating a large area of good cultivable land if properly supplied with water. The estimated cost of the barrage and head work is £1,250,000, but that of the whole scheme, including the opening up of the Hai Channel, is not known. By the end of the year much of the necessary survey work had been completed departmentally, and the prepara tion during the early summer of 1933 of the plans and documents necessary for a call for tenders was contemplated. The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company (Limited), the British firm which has owned river steamers in this country for over half a century, is watching the proposals with some concern as to the effect of the barrage upon navigation in the Tigris below Kut. The Iraqi Government have received their representations on the subject sympathetically. Capital Works Expenditure against Oil Revenues. 249. The cumulative deficit on the national accounts brought forward on the 1st April, 1931, was 33-69 lakhs of rupees (£252,675) and this was swollen to 55-40 lakhs of rupees (£405,500) by the over-expenditure in the financial year1931. These figures, however, take no account of the money received from the Iraq Petroleum Company, two instalments of which were received during the financial year, one in August 1931 and the other in February 1932. receipts have been taken to a separate account, against which has been charged the expen diture upon the capital works authorised under the “Five-Year Plan. I he receipts, after allowing for the 10 per cent, due to Turkey under the Treaty of Ankara, brought in 115-9 lakhs of rupees (£870,000). The expenditure on capital works was restricted to a sum of 24 -2 lakhs of rupees (£181,500). The balance of the money was utilised in replenishing the Fxchequer, which had been depleted by the succession of annual deficits and had been financed by temporary borrowing. Details of the special receipts and expenditure are contained in the statement below :— Receipts: Oil Revenue.

The close of the financial year 1932 may be said to mark the end of the period of decline in the finances of the Government. The rigid control exerted by the Saidi Cabinet over all forms of Government expenditure, and the measures taken to restrict expenditure within a steadily falling income, prevented a series of heavy deficits and paved the way for better times. During the financial year 1932-33 normal revenue was once again in excess of normal expenditure. Revenue from agricultural produce showed a tendency to improve, and revenue receipts were up to budget expectations. A surplus of receipts over expenditure of approximately £180,000 was realised at the end of the first nine months of the year. In addition to this, the first payment of £112,500 (£100.000 gold, less 10 per cent, due to Turkey) by the British Oil Development Company was due on the 1st January, 1933, and another annual payment of approximately £595,000 (£409,000 gold) was due from the Iraq Petroleum Company on the same date. Both these sums have been received. The Government's cash reserves were, there fore, large and the country’s financial position had been completely rehabilitated. With no capital debt, no floating debt, and a substantial Treasury balance, the Government is in a thoroughly healthy financial position, a happy state of affairs very largely due to oil. Port of Basra. 252. As was anticipated, the working of the port was affected by the general trade depression, but by careful management, rigid restriction of expenditure and retrenchment of personnel, income exceeded expenditure by a fair margin, after paying the ninth instalment (£37,875) of the capital debt due to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. The volume of import cargo was disappointing, but the amount of export tonnage, aided by heavy shipments of dates and grain, reached a satisfactory total and showed a further increase.

The number of vessels which entered the port area during the year 1931-32 was 793, as compared with 819 during the previous year, the respective gross tonnage being 4,606,556 as against 4,609,258. Of these 176 ships with a gross tonnage of 774,722 entered the port of Basra, the remaining 643, chiefly oil tankers, proceeding to the ports of Abadan or Mohammerah. 255. Comparative figures of tonnage, directly pertaining to Iraq, loaded and discharged within the port of Basra during the last five years are given below :— Year. Imports. Exports.

The Fao Bar dredging operations made steady progress throughout the year, and a low water depth of 23 feet has been declared in the dredged channel. 257. The following table shows the dredging receipts and expenditure during the fifteen months up to the 31st March, 1932 :— Receipts— Dredging dues Miscellaneous •* Rupees. 36,61,530 65,661 Total 37,27,191 Expenditure— Salaries and wages ..

Of the original loan of £462,100 taken from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, a sum of £195,000 had been repaid, plus interest charges in full up to the 31st March, 1932, and a further payment of £50,000 is due to be paid in the financial year 1932.51 [8744] F 259. During the year a new dredging agreement to replace that then in force was the subject of discussions between the Government and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and was signed on the 2nd June. The agreement had not been ratified by Parliament at the end of the year. Iraqi Railways. 260. The railways continued to suffer from the economic depression through out the whole of the financial year 1931-32.^ All classes of traffic suffered diminution, which was particularly noticeable in the tonnage of imported goods. A further decline was observed in the volume of transit trade to Persia. Passenger mileage and receipts during the first eight months of the year decreased consider ably, but was to some extent restored by drastic reductions in the third-class fares, which placed the railways in a better position to compete with the cut rates introduced by their road transport competitors. It became apparent early in the year that the figures of anticipated revenue were not likely to be reached, and effective action was taken to reduce expenditure in all possible ways. Imported staff was repatriated, and the salaries of practically all classes of employees were reduced. On account of the shortfall of revenue no payments were made during the year to the renewals fund, although provision was made in the estimates for the full amount of approximately £75,000. By these means the accounts for the financial year showed a small surplus, the amount of which was allocated to the renewals fund. The following are the figures :— Rupees. Revenue ... ... ... ... ... 61,21,810 Operating expenditure ... ... ... 58,95,689 Miscellaneous expenditure not affecting opera tion of railways (net) ... ... ... 28,067 Net surplus ...- ... ... ... 1,98,054 261. The position became brighter after the first quarter of 1932, owing to the importation of large quantities of pipes and other material by the Iraq Petroleum Company, which brought considerable revenue to the railways. It is, however, becoming certain that, when this period of exceptional traffic has passed, the railways, which pay no interest upon capital, will not be able to continue to function as a separate economic unit unless further capital is provided and the vital extension to Mosul is completed. (B) Trade and Commerce. General. 262. At the beginning of the year the prospects of Iraq’s recovery from the world-wide trade depression were gloomy. There had been two years of market stagnation. The Persian transit trade was still further reduced by Persian Government restrictions. The staple industry of Iraq is agriculture, and, in 1932, agricultural conditions were adverse. The rainfall in the winter was abnormally low. Spring crops were consequently unsatisfactory, and animal mortality was very heavy owing to the lack of grazing. Dates were affected by disease owing to abnormal dust storms. The export of produce declined. In spite of an abnormal export of gold to Europe, the total value of exports fell by about 10 per cent, as compared with 1931. Nevertheless, by the close of the year, an optimistic tone prevailed. The Iraq Petroleum Company had made their first annual dead rent payment and had begun work on the pipe-line to the Mediterranean. The Government improved their financial position and launched an ambitious development programme. Imports increased in total value by over 20 per cent, compared with 1931, indicating a revival in the country’s purchasing powers, although the increase was to some extent due to importations by the Iraq Petroleum Company of materials for their pipe-line.52 Foreign Trade. 263. The Customs Department publish statistics for financial years only, but the following calendar year figures have been extracted. They are subject to revision.

The Ministry of Finance have, however, estimated the value of various invisible exports. Amongst these may be mentioned {a) expenditure in Iraq by His Majesty’s Government on the British forces; (h) expenditure in Iraq by the oil companies and other foreign concessionnaires; (c) expenditure in Iraq by pilgrims and tourists; (d) profits of Iraqi transporters and merchants especially in connexion with the transit trade; and (e) interest on Iraqi capital invested abroad. The Ministry have deduced with the greatest reserve that the six financial years ending on the 31st March, 1932, resulted in a total unfavourable balance of not more than £1,500,000. For the financial year 1931-32, owing to the payments by the oil companies, they calculate a favourable balance of £371,000. General. Imports. In Iraq practically all manufactured articles are imported. Such local industries as exist are unable to supply local requirements As the foregoing statisticsmdicate, the import of greatest value is textiles; and, in 1932 compared favourably with 1931. The textile import is comprised approximate!v of 85 per cent, cotton, 14 per cent, silk and artificial silk, and 1 per cent woollen piece-goods^ The second largest import is sugar, and in 1932 the annual average of about 30,000 tons was maintained. Importations of metals and machinery were considerably greater m 1932 than in 1931 owing to Iraq Petroleum Company's requirements. The company’s importations of metal pipes alone amounted in value to over 40 lakhs. In 1932 the value of vehicles (aeroplanes and mctoi cars) imported was nearly twice that of 1931. Otherwise the imnrove ment in the import trade was not confined to any particular commodities. Japanese Competition. 265. During 1932 there was a notable increase in the importation to Iraq of Japanese goods, especially cotton textiles. Japanese prices fell so rmidlv that Iraqi markets were disorganised, and proposals for restrictions on Japanese imports were made by the Iraqi Chamber of Commerce to the foreign commis sioners engaged by the Government to revise the Customs Tariff53 Soviet Trading. 266. Throughout the year Soviet steamships from Odessa visited the Shatt-al-Arab about twice a month. They brought mixed cargoes of timber, sugar, automobiles (from the Ford factory at Istanbul), piece-goods, procelain and glass-ware. They took up Iraqi dates, grain, and wool for Red Sea ports and for Port Said in transit to Europe. The latest customs statistics available show the value of imports from the U.S.S.R. in the financial year 1931-32 as 8 lakhs of rupees and no export to the U.S.S.R. 267. Soviet trade made little headway in Iraq during 1932. 268. A representative of the Soviet Government Trading Organisation was permitted to visit Bagdad, ostensibly to buy wool. He appointed agents in Bagdad to deal in Soviet sugar, piece-goods and other commodities, and an agent in Basra for shipping and imports generally. He attempted without success to form an Iraqi syndicate to import Soviet oil products. In July the Iraqi Govern ment refused to renew his permis de sejour and he had to leave Iraq. In November he applied for permission to return, again ostensibly to buy wool, but nothing more was heard of him by the end of the year. 269. The Soviet authorities applied for permission to participate in the Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition held at Bagdad in April, but this was refused because all available space in the exhibition grounds had already been allotted. Imports from the United Kingdom. 270. Normally about 30 per cent, of Iraq’s imports come from the E T nited Kingdom. In 1932 the total value of the import from the United Kingdom was 243 lakhs (£1,822,500) or 31 per cent, of the total imports, a considerable improve ment compared with 1931. The increase was due primarily to the Iraq Petroleum Company’s importations. In spite of Japanese competition Manchester’s share in the Iraqi market for cotton piece-goods remained at about 40 per cent, during the year. It was fostered by the divorce of sterling from gold and by the introduction of the new Iraqi currency on a sterling basis. Transit. 271. The transit trade of Iraq consists mainly of goods consigned to and from Persia. It is dependent upon developments in Persia and is not affected to any marked degree by conditions in Iraq. Owing to the policy adopted by the Persian Government with a view, first, to restrict foreign imports, and, secondly, to divert them from the Iraqi routes, this entrepot traffic has declined during the past ten years. During 1932, imports into Persia via Mohammerah greatly increased and the new Persian port of Bandar Shahpur near the mouth of the Shatt-al-Arab began to accommodate ocean traffic. Leading Iraqi merchants withdrew entirely from Persian business. On the other hand, transit traffic with Persia by the Syrian overland motor routes developed despite the Persian Government restrictions. In 1932 the value of goods in transit to Persia again substantially decreased; the decline in the value of the total Iraqi transit trade to and from Persia was not so marked in 1932 as in 1931, because the Persian regulations designed to equalise imports and exports artificially maintained the export trade from Persia via Iraq at the level of the previous year. Exports. 272. The principal exports of Iraq are dates, grain, wool, hides and skins. 273. According to some estimates, Iraq supplies over 80 per cent, of the world’s dates. In 1932 export exceeded expectations, and there is some evidence that local consumption is declining, thus freeing a larger surplus for export; 160,000 tons were exported to a value of 119 lakhs, a slight increase in value, but a decrease in tonnage compared with 1931. India is Iraq’s principal customer for dates, followed by the United States of America. 274. During 1932 a Date Research Board was set up at Basra under the chairmanship of the Collector of Customs to advise the Government generally on matters appertaining to date production and marketing, and generally to assist [8744] ' f 254: and foster the trade. The board is to be financed partly by / This and partly by means of special export tax on dates of 1 pci cen .a tax had not been introduced by the end of the year. 275. Owing to lack of rainfall, the surplus of grain for export in 1932 was ^ much below the average. Stocks were held in the hope of an 1 , • 1939 ’ both in Iraq and in Persia. Local grain prices more than doubled during f ^ Wheat quotations, in particular, stood so high in the autumn , , , uneconomic. The barley export in 1932 was 79,000 tons, va u Tv; n g-dom compared with 157,000 tons, valued at 53 lakhs, m 1931. 1 he United King( remained the principal customer, but the proportion of the to a exp • continent was unusually large. As regards other grains, seveia XP , i and millet are exported to Europe for “ feeding purposes, and this export has largely increased in recent years. 276. The export of wool declined during 1932, owing to adverse conditions. Iraqi wool is required chiefly for carpet-making in the United States ot America, which at present is a depressed industry. 277. Owing to market stagnation, the export of hides and skins continued to decline in 1932. 278. Normally there is a considerable export of intestines (sheep s casings) to the United States of America and Germany for use in the manufactuie of sausages. During 1932, the United States of America authorities placed severe restrictions on traffic in Iraqi casings owing to insanitary methods employed m Iraqi abattoirs. The authorities prepared schemes to improve conditions, but little had been accomplished by the end of the year and the export of casings was much reduced. 279. Cotton prices did not improve during 1932 and the cultivation of cotton in Iraq for export remained uneconomic. The total 1932 crop received in the ginneries did not produce more than 350 bales. There are two ginneries each capable of handling for export more than 10,000 bales a year. One of them is the property of the British Cotton Growing Association, who are likely to withdraw from Iraq in the near future. 280. Owing to the demand for gold in Europe, record quantities of gold were exported in 1932. Not only gold liras and tomans, but also gold ornaments, were melted into bars for export, to be refined in Paris or London. Much of this export was effected by aerial transport. In general, the money available in the country in 1932 was far in excess of trade requirements, and Iraqis appear to have invested widely abroad during the year. Exports to the United Kingdom. 281. Normally about 30 per cent, of Iraq’s exports go to the United Kingdom. In 1932, the United Kingdom share rose to 37 per cent, and was valued at 149 lakhs (£1,117,500). The reason for this increase was that the greater part of the abnormal gold export was sent to London to be refined. So far as Iraqi produce is concerned, exportation to the United Kingdom declined sharply in value during 1932. 282. The introduction in February 1932 of the new United Kingdom tariffs with Imperial preference caused consternation in Iraq, and representations were made by King Faisal and the Iraqi Government for consideration of the country’s claim to preferential treatment. In the event no preference was given to Iraq at Ottawa and, although the Ottawa decisions were not put into force until November, the general 10 per cent, ad valorem duty was applied to dates, barley and wheat from February, so that Iraqi exports were subiect to United Kingdom tariff for the greater part of 1932. 283. The date trade was not appreciably affected. The United Kingdom share of the date export remained in 1932 at about 16 per cent. It is tending to increase, owing to advertisement and better packing methods. 284. The United Kingdom share of the barley export fell from about 90 per cent, to about 70 per cent., and of the wheat export from about 65 per cent, to55 [8744] f 3 about 20 per cent. However, in the opinion of shippers, these substantial falls in the United Kingdom share of Iraq’s barley and wheat export were not due to the tariffs. No doubt uncertainty as to tariff liability before the Ottawa decisions were put into force was to some extent responsible; but market conditions unrelated to the United Kingdom tariff diverted barley and wheat exports to the • continent. There was a glut in the London markets and a better demand on the continent. 285. The export of maize to the United Kingdom improved in 1932. Maize is on the free list in the United Kingdom tariff, except for the special variety known as flat white, which is not produced in Iraq. Wool and hides and skins are also on the free list in the United Kingdom tariff. The United Kingdom takes little Iraqi wool, but is the principal customer for her hides and skins. Industrial Development. 286. During 1932 the Iraqi Government continued to encourage home industries. Exemption from customs import duty was accorded to five cigarette making factories and two wool mills, while grants-in-aid under article 7 of the Law for Capital Works Development were made to two wool mills and to one tannery. A loan to the National Cotton Ginnery was also sanctioned. 287. An Agricultural and Industrial Exhibition held in Bagdad under official auspices during April gave the embryo industries an opportunity to display their wares. This was the first attempt in Iraq at an agricultural or trade fair; it was popular and well attended. 288. However, apart from the cigarette factories, which greatly increased and improved their output, there was little progress during 1932 in industrial development. The following incident illustrates, on the other hand, that national industries do enjoy considerable popular support: During 1932 Messrs. Bata opened shops in Iraq to retail Czechoslovakian boots and shoes at extremely low prices. Agitation against the company in the press was fostered by the local shoe-making industry, and early in May the shops were picketed by students who molested would-be purchasers. Police intervention eventually put an end to the movement. Concessions. Iraq Petroleum Company. 289. In May 1931, when the Iraq Petroleum Company made the first dead rent payment due to the Iraqi Government under the revised agreement of the 24th March, 1931, Great Britain had not abandoned the gold standard, and no question arose as to the basis of payment in gold prescribed by the agreement. When the second payment fell due on the 1st January, 1932, amounting in all to £409,000 (gold), the exchange situation had radically changed. The Iraqi Government presented a draft for £409,000 (gold) drawn in accordance with the provisions of the concession; and the company informed the Government’s bankers in London that if such a draft was presented it would be met by a payment in sterling, on the grounds that, under English law, a gold debt was met by a sterling payment. Later the company stated that they were prepared to pay on a sterling basis without prejudice to negotiation of the question; but made it clear that, acting on legal advice, they considered that they were justified in refusing to pay on any other basis. This aroused great indignation in Bagdad. The Iraqi Government had based their budget estimates on payment by the company in gold, i.e., about £578,000 in sterling, and would have been compelled to curtail their programme of capital works if this amount did not materialise. The local press denounced the company’s attempt to discharge its obligations in depreciated sterling as another imperialistic outrage on Iraq. By the end of January no decision had been reached, and on the 3rd February a question on the subject in the Iraqi Parliament gave rise to a lively debate. In February, however, as the result of discussions in London between the Prime Minister, Nuri Pasha A1 Said, and Sir John Cadman, the chairman of the company, the Iraq Petroleum Company paid, without prejudice to either party, the sum of £578,000 in full settlement.56 290. Proposals were subsequently discussed w , t j 1 ' j a nuarvl' l 9:i2, demand, not only payment at the sterling price of go o whi[ .h payment involving a further £ 112 , but also interest loi the P e '^, UUUn ° was delayed. These proposals were not, however, puisued. 291. When the next instalment fell dim on the Janua^ 1933 the ^ company paid the Iraqi Government the full amounts due in sterling at the current price of gold. 292. In April an agreement was concluded between the Iraqi and the Iraq Petroleum Company amending article , j convention so as to permit the company to import the Mediterranean via Basra free of duty, even if re-expoited acioss the western frontier in the course of construction. 293. In March the Iraq Petroleum Company formed a subsidiary company named the Mediterranean Pipe-Lines (Limited), as n^nada convention. The company will own the pipe-line and ^s registered “ Canady and the work of the construction is being undertaken by the Iraq i etioleum Company. 294. In November the Iraq Petroleum Company formed the Iraq Petroleum Transport Company (Limited) to own aircraft for use on pipe-line woik is was necessary because the Iraq Petroleum Company had not a ma J 0 ”^y , , \ nationals or nationals of any other State on their board, and were thus debarred under the International Air Convention from obtaining registration foi aircraft. 295. During 1932 the Iraq Petroleum Company concentrated their activities on their pipe-line system to the Mediterranean, and at the end of the yeai weie in advance of their programme. Pipes had been strung in Iraqi territory from Kirkuk to Baiii on the Tigris, and on the greater part of the stretch from Baiji to Haditha on the Euphrates. Pipes had also been strung from Mafrak in Transiordania westwards to Haifa and eastwards about 50 miles into the Lava Desert. The company were also stringing from Homs for the Tripoli line. 296. The construction of a telephone line from Kirkuk towards Pransjoi dan was undertaken by the Iraqi Government Post and Telegraphs Depaitment for the company, and by the end of the year the line had been completed and was in use from Kirkuk to near Haditha. 297. The company did not entirely discontinue drilling operations. One rig was in commission throughout the year in the main held near Kirkuk, lour new wells were brought to production (Nos. K 30 to K 33). A total footage of about 10,000 feet was drilled. 298. During 1932 the company produced 13,346 tons of oil for their own use; of this, they rehned 10,173 tons, the balance being expended on well tests or kept in storage. Quarters for their staff at Kirkuk were almost completed by the end of the year. The company installed a water supply system for the Kirkuk Municipality, providing pumps, 2 miles of pipe-line and some tanks free of charge. British Oil Development Company. 299. In June 1931 the Iraqi Government invited applications for the grant of oil concessions in Iraqi territory not covered by the concessions to the Anglo- Persian Oil Company and the Iraq Petroleum Company. In October of that year they decided to enter into negotiations with the British Oil Development Company, and at the beginning of 1932 these negotiations were still in progress. In January Lord Wester Wemyss and Sir Edward Mountain visited Bagdad for about a week, but were unable to reach agreement in that time, although the Iraqi Government were evidently anxious to conclude a convention. The chief obstacle to settlement was a telegram received from the Iraqi Prime Minister, then in Rome, to the effect that not less than £200,000 (gold) annual dead rent should be accepted. During February and March a series of drafts and counter-drafts was under discussion and, early in April, Mr. E. C. Simmons arrived in Bagdad to conduct the final negotiations with power to sign on behalf of the company. In spite of various difficulties, the agreement was signed on the 20th April. Letters57 were also exchanged containing supplementary provisions, particularly in regard to the method of payment in gold to be adopted. The agreement was confirmed in the Iraqi Parliament by a special law on the 29th May. The British Oil Develop ment Company thereby secured exclusive oil rights for seventy-five years over “all the lands of Iraq situated west of the Tigris River and north of the 9 33rd parallel of latitude.” On their part, the company undertook, inter alia {a) To export a million tons a year within seven and a half years, provided this quantity of petroleum can ‘ ‘ with reasonable diligence ’ ’ be made available from the concession area. (b) To pay the Government annual dead rent until regular export begins as and the 1st January, 1937, and subsequent years £200,000 (gold). (c) To pay the Government a royalty of 4s. (gold) per ton for twenty years after regular export begins, and thereafter, subject to revision on the basis of the company’s profits, such royalty for the first twenty years not to be less than £ 200,000 (gold), provided that the oil resources of the concession area permit of the production of a million tons a year with reasonable diligence on the part of the company. (d) To allot to the Government, free of cost at well-head, 20 per cent, of the oil extracted, and to purchase this oil from the Government, if required to do so, at a definite rate. Having obtained their concession, the company made no further move in Iraq until November, when they appointed a representative to reside in Mosul, and sent to Iraq a party of geologists, under Mr. Beeby Thompson, to prepare a report. It is understood that the future policy of the company will depend upon their report which was not completed by the end of the year. 300. In December the British Oil Development Company formed a private company, named “ The Mosul Oil-Fields Company,” with a nominal capital of £1 million, to carry out their operations under the concession. The Iraq Petroleum Company approached the Iraqi Government, pointing out that this name might give rise to confusion with their own organisation, especially in the United States of America, where “ Mosul oil ” is normally connected with the Iraq Petroleum Company. The British Oil Development Company refused, however, to alter the name of their new company unless the Uaq Petroleum Company would also alter their name, suggesting the “ Western ” and “ Eastern Mosul Oil-fields.” The Iraq Petroleum Company did not agree to this. 301. During the summer a dispute arose in regard to article 8 of the British Oil Development Company’s concession, which binds the Iraqi Government to permit them at all times to have access to such geological information in respect of their concession area as the Government may possess. The Iraqi Petroleum Company claimed that this provision could not apply to plans and reports delivered to the Iraqi Government under clause 8 of their own concession. Meanwhile, the British Oil Development Company protested against the delay in handing over these documents. The matter was eventually settled by negotiation in London. The plans and reports in question were examined by an Iraq Petroleum Company geologist, in conjunction with a representative of the Govern ment, to ensure that they contained no information relating to the present concession area of the Iraq Petroleum Company. Jhey were then handed over to the British Oil Development Company, who undertook that no part of them should be published in any prospectus without the consent of the Iraqi Govern ment. In the event of refusal of consent, the matter is to be referred to arbitration. Khanaqin Oil Company and Rafidain Oil Company. 302. In May 1932 the Khanaqin Oil Company (Limited) (the Anglo- Persian Oil Company subsidiary operating the Naft Khana field in Iraq) transferred that portion of their business relating to marketing oil products in follows : £ (gold). 100,000 125.000 150.000 175.000 January 1, 1933 January 1, 1934 January 1, 1935 January 1, 1936 [8744] f 4• HHBHPPV 58 Iraq to a new company known as the Rafidain Oil Company was formed in accordance with article 14 of the Iraq Fetioleum Como any convention which permits the Iraq Petroleum Company to set up a marketing company for the purpose of supplying the petroleum r^ui^men s o Iraq. Its formation is held to have released the Anglo-1 | * their obligation to supply Iraq’s requirements Nevertheles^ during 1932 the Rafidain Oil Company supplied Iraq from the Khanaqm Oil Compa Y a Khana field, and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, South 1 ersian field; and not from the Iraq Petroleum Company field. 303. The Iraqi Government were at first inclined to place difficulties in the way of the Rafidain Oil Company, probably because they had anticipated competition between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Iraq Petroleum Company to supply Iraq’s requirements with resulting reductions in prices of oil products in Iraq In July, however, they informed the Iraq Petroleum Company that the Rafidain Oil Company was officially recognised as the marketing company enioyino 1 the privileges laid down in the Iraq Petroleum Company Convention. Nevertheless, they reserved a decision as to the right of the Rafidain Oil Company to draw their petroleum from other than the Iraq Petroleum Company s field. 304 Throughout the year the Khanaqin Oil Company were producing from the Naft Khana field for the requirements of Iraq. Their total production of refined products pumped from their refinery at Alwand, near Khanaqin, for distribution in Iraq was :— Tons. Fuel oil ... ••• ••• ••• 56,068 Kerosene ... ... ••• ••• 14,490 Petrol ... ... ... ••• 12,132 The following tonnage was imported from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s South Persian refinery at Abadan for distribution in the southern districts of Iraq :— Tons. Fuel oil 44,613 Kerosene ... ... ... ... 4,520 Petrol ... ... ... ... 3,000 305. In 1932 the Khanaqin Oil Company continued to explore the Naft Khana field with the drill, but suspended operations in the Chia Surkh field. In all they drilled 700 feet during the year. Cement. 306. The Iraqi Government committed themselves, subject to parliamentary sanction, to grant a cement concession to Yasin Pasha Al-Hashimi and Dr. Muhammed Haidar. An Iraqi company is to be formed and to enjoy a monopoly of cement production in Iraq for eight years, provided they instal plant capable of producing at least 30,000 tons of standard cement annually. Pending parliamentary sanction, the Government gave the concessionnaires a temporary licence to enable them to form the company and obtain quotations for plant. By the end of the year little definite progress had been made. Bitumen. 307. In 1931, Messrs. Mawson, Vernon and Co. of Bombay negotiated an agreement with the Iraqi Government for the export of bitumen from the lakes in the desert west of Ramadi to Bombay for road-making purposes. During 1932, possibly owing to the depression, the company suspended operations, and defaulted in their annual payment due to the Iraqi Government on the 1 st January, 1932. The agreement thus lapsed, and the Iraqi Government are not expected to renew it. At the end of the year the company still had several thousand tons of bitumen in store at Bagdad. Gold. 308. In February the Iraqi Government granted to Hajji Muhammad Bassam a concession, valid for seventy-five years, for the exploitation of gold in the Qara district in the desert to the north-east of Rutbah. The concession is a comprehensive document, including railway, telegraph and telephone provisions.59 Certain payments to Government are included, and these were discharged by the concessionnaire so far as they became liable in 1932, but he had not begun to work by the end of the year. In December he asked for a moratorium as regards 1933 payments, but this was refused, on the grounds that the gold-mining industry is not affected by the prevailing depression. Bagdad Town Planning. 309. A French architect named M. Rotival secured the interest of the King and Government in his plans for a new Bagdad on the right bank of the Tigris. By the end of the year, however, little progress had been made, and M. Rotival appeared to have been unsuccessful in obtaining the financial support he expected on the continent. Bagdad Electric Light and Power Company. 310. A law was enacted in 1932 amending the original agreement of the Bagdad Electric Light and Power Company, so as to abolish the provisions relating to tramways and to reduce the maximum rate chargeable for current. The company’s new power station was nearing completion at the end of the year. It is up-to-date in design, capable of supplying considerably more than the present requirements of the city. The Government’s share of profits earned before the installation of the new power-house was in dispute during the year, and this dispute prevented the public issue of shares to which the company is bound by their agreement. Basra Electric Power Station. 311. The Port of Basra were authorised to set up their own electrical power station in Basra, and to supply the public in supersession of the arrangement whereby their current is obtained from the power station of the Royal Air Force. Orders for the necessary plant were placed through the Crown Agents. Mosul Electric Power Station. 312. Tenders were allotted in the United Kingdom for a new electrical power station at Mosul, and at the end of the year the plant was being installed. Government Works. Irrigation. 313 The irrigation schemes provided for in the Capital Works Development Law are discussed in paragraphs 243-243. Apart from these the only major irrigation work undertaken was the construction, at the cost of £50,000, ot a new head regulator to the Shatt-al-Hillah. This regulator is an auxiliary to the Hindiyah barrage. Tenders were invited, and the contract was allotted to a French contractor residing in Bagdad. Bridges: Fallujah Bridge. 314. The steel road-bridge across the Euphrates at Fallujah, on the main Bagdad-Damascus road, was opened by the King in April 1932. Work on this bridge was begun in 1927, but was suspended owing to a dispute with the contractor which led to lengthy and costly arbitration proceedings in London. The course of the proceedings was mainly m the favour of the Iiaqi Government. Mosul Bridge. 315 In 1932 the Iraqi Government themselves undertook construction oi a new road bridge over the Tigris at Mosul, and by the end of the year about a third of the work had been completed. The steel work was supplied by Mesbis. t_ir William Arrol of Glasgow and other United Kingdom firms. V.—Communications. Railways. 316. The Iraqi railways undertook no major works during 1932, and their services remained unaltered.GO 317. The International Wagon-Lit Company, inaugurated in March 1932, and continued during the year, a motor service between Bagdad and lehran, connecting with the railway service to and from Europe by the lauius and Simplon-Orient Express. Roads. 318. Expenditure on roads was curtailed except in the north. An all- weather strategical road was constructed from near Rowanduz to Mirowa, in the Barzan district. Rowanduz Route. 319. The main road from Arbil via Rowanduz and Rayat to the Persian frontier, begun in 1926, was taken to the frontier, and opened to traffic, at the beginning of September 1932. It connects at the frontier with a new road, constructed by the Persian Government, running to Haiderabad at the south-west corner of Lake Urmiah. A Persian Government tug service provides transport to Sharaf-Khaneh at the north-east corner of the lake, the terminus of a railway to Tabriz. There is also a road to Tabriz round the east side of the lake passable for light motor transport. 320. With the coming of the winter rains in November this route between Iraq and Persia was, to all intents and purposes, closed to motor traffic. On the Iraq side the last 28 miles had not been completed as an “ all-weather ” road. On the Persian side there was still much metalling to be done. 321. At the end of the year it was hoped that the route would be tested commercially in the spring of 1933 and would be made fit for heavy traffic in all weathers by the autumn of 1933. From the Persian point of view, it is of special importance, because it constitutes a challenge to Russian economic domination in North-West Persia. Overland Motor Traffic. 322. The year 1932 saw further development of the overland motor routes across the Syrian desert, especially in the transport of light and valuable goods. Larger vehicles were used and rates fell to little more than Sd. a ton mile between Bagdad and Damascus. Steps to divert traffic from the Syrian route, via Damascus and Beirut, to the Palestine route, via Amman and Haifa, were taken under the auspices of the Iraqi Railways with a view to establish direct freight connexions at Haifa before the proposed Bagdad-Haifa railway is constructed. The Palestine Post Office allotted a contract for the carriage of their mails to Bagdad via Amman, taking effect from June 1932, and the contractor succeeding in obtaining from the Iraqi Government a contract to carry all Iraqi overland mails via Amman, taking effect from November 1932. As regards customs control on this route, arrangements were made in 1932 for discussion between the Iraqi, Palestine and Transjordan Customs departments with a view to co-operation. A ir. Air Navigation Companies. 323. During 1932 the following air navigation companies were operating to and through Iraq : Messrs. Imperial Airways (Limited) continued their weekly services between London and Karachi via Bagdad, as provided in their agreement with His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. Iraqi air mails were carried by this service. The deflection of their route in October from the Persian to the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf did not affect the timings of their service in Iraq. During the summer of 1932 they operated a subsidiary passenger service between Bagdad and Palestine connecting with Lloyd Triestino sailings to Europe. United Kingdom air mails to Iraq were carried by this service. During the year Imperial Airways frequently failed to maintain their scheduled time-table for Iraq. The Iraqi authorities were inclined to criticise the charges for air mails fixed by the London Post Office. The latter refused to allow them to pay in sterling instead of gold francs when, in January, the rupee exchange depreciated in relation to gold.61 324. This entailed an increase in the air mail surcharge to the public in Iraq, amounting, in the case of letters from Bagdad to London, to 1 additional anna for 10 grammes. The Iraqi authorities also objected on the ground that, in accordance with their agreement with His Majesty’s Government, the company were prevented from negotiating direct mail contracts with the Iraqi Govern ment. In the course of the year both the French Air Union (Lignes d Orient) and the Royal Dutch Air lane agreed to negotiate direct mail contracts with the Iraqi Post Office if desired; and the Iraqi authorities warned Messrs. Imperial Airways that, unless they could fall into line, it was likely that ai i angements would be made elsewhere for the carriage of Iraqi air mails and for the proposed Iraqi air-parcel service. During 1932 the Air Union (Lignes d Onent) operated two regular services between Marseilles and Saigon and a weekly service between Bagdad and Damascus, both carrying mails, passengers and freights. Confidence in the company was somewhat shaken by a fatal accident which occurred in March, the president of the League of Nations I rentier Commission being killed. In April the company requested permission for their aircraft to land at the Royal Air Force Mosul aerodrome. This was refused on the grounds that it would “ cause a degree of congestion and administrative difficulty quite incompatible with military efficiency.” During 1932 the Royal Dutch Aar Line (K L M ) operated a regular service once a week between Amsterdam and Batavia via Bagdad. This service did not normally carry passengers, mails or freight to and from Iraq. For the first quarter of 1932 the Junker Aviation Company operated a service carrying passengers, freight and mails twice a week in hot directions between Bagdad and Tehran. At the end of March they were compelled to close down owing largely to financial difficulties. Proposed Services: The Iraqi Transport Company. 325. In Januarv an Iraqi company named “ The Iraqi Transport Company (Limited) ” was formed under the auspices of the Junker Aviation Company, apparently to operate services in Iraq with Junker aeroplanes. Nothing more was heard of this venture after the withdrawal of Junker s from Persia. Iraq Airwork (Limited). 326 During 1932, Messrs. Airwork (Limited), of Heston, who were already operating in Egypt, entered into negotiation with the Iraqi Government for a concession to operate taxi, charter, and feeder services in Iraq and also to give flying instruction. The scheme provided for Government participation in the company in return for the sole right of cabotage for fifteen years A subsidiary company was formed and registered in Iraq as Iraq Airwork (Limited), but agreement was' not reached with the Government by the end of the year. Government Assistance to Civil Aviation. The declared policy of the Iraqi Government during 1932 was to give every Jossibl? assistance to civil aviation. At Eutbah in the Syrian desert thev provided a Government aerodrome of which all commercial and private aeroplanes made use as desired. Wireless and meterological services were provided by the Iraqi Government and no landing were ch^ged. _ At Bagda Til commercial and private aeroplanes used the Bagdad West aeroarome provided for Messrs. Imperial Airways under their agreement with His Majesty s Government. Wireless services for this aerodrome were operated by the Royal Air Force until the Iraqi Government set up their own wireless station. Landing fees and charges for hangar and ground services were levied by Imperial Airways Lood nropress was made during 1932 on a new public aerodrome situated about 2 miles Horn Bagdad City which the Iraqi Government are constructing on ud to date lines °At Basra the Iraqi Government came to no decision in 1932 as 'regards provision of a public aerodrome. Imperial Airways were the only aviatfon company operating a regular service to Basra, and they used the Royal l'ce aerodrome at Shaibah No so, and private aeroplanes cou^ ^^ppHed generally to other aerodromes in permission or in e g y p t of the Royal Air Force. Landing fees were not^chargeif for^ thdr use occasionally or m emergency The most important Tthese aerodromes was that at Ur, which was available for forced landings between Bagdad and Bushire.— ■I— 02 General. 328. Various problems connected with aerial navigation arose during the year, such as the liability to customs duty of aeroplanes specially chartered for flights in Iraq, and the customs fomalities relating to freight by air. These matters were not decided by the end of the year, partly owing to the absence of ^ specific legislation dealing with aerial navigation. During March Mr. Bertram, Deputy Director of Civil Aviation in the Air Ministry, visited Iraq and discussed such questions with officials concerned. VI.— Air and Military Matters. The Royal Air Force. 329. For the major part of the year Air Vice-Marshal Sir Edgar R. Ludlow-Hewitt, K.C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O., M.C., was Air Officer Commanding. He left to take up a home appointment in the third week in September. Air Vice-Marshal C. S. Burnett, C.B., C.B.E., D.S.O., was appointed to succeed him, but did not arrive in Iraq until early December. In the interval command was assumed by Air Commodore C. L. Courtney, C.B., C.B.E., D.S.O. 330. During 1932 the strength and distribution of the Royal Air Force garrison in Iraq remained unchanged, with the exception of a certain number of temporary moves, necessitated by operations in Kurdistan. The distribution of the fighting units at their permanent stations was as follows :— Hinaidi— 1 bomber squadron. 1 bomber-transport squadron. 2 sections, armoured cars. Mosul— 1 bomber squadron. 1 section, armoured cars. Shaibah— 1 bomber squadron. Basra— 1 flying-boat squadron. 1 section, armoured cars. Hinaidi also contained air headquarters, the aircraft depot, general hospital, and the usual maintenance and ancillary units. Operations in Kurdistan. 331. In mid March the Iraq army embarked upon operations for the purpose of bringing under Government control that area of Iraqi Kurdistan which was then under the influence of the recalcitrant Sheikh Ahmad of Barzan. Details of the part played by the Royal Air Force in these operations have been given above under a separate heading. Transportation of a Battalion from Egypt. 332. In June, owing to troubles amongst the Assyrian levies in regard to their future in Iraq when the mandate lapsed, it was found necessary to augment the British garrison by one battalion drawn from the Egyptian Command The 1 st Battalion, Northamptonshire Regiment, was therefore flown to Hinaidi from Ismailia. The move started on the 22nd June, and was completed on the 27th by which time the first companies to arrive had been distributed to Mosul Diana and Suleimani. 333. By the second week in July the situation permitted the return of the battalion to Egypt, which was clear of Iraq Command by the 11 th August In spite of being hampered by severe dust storms and a certain number of forced landings, the inward and outward moves were carried out to schedule and without incident. j 1 * l63 The Royal Air Force in the Persian Gulf. 334. Steady development of air activities along the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf took place throughout the year. 335. In February and March flying boats and land-planes took part in reconnaissances and demonstrations at and in the neighbourhood of Sur, in Muscat State. This action was the result of an appeal to the British authorities from the Sultan of Muscat for assistance in bringing the Beni Bu Ali tribe under control. A combined operation under the direction of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was planned, and sloops of the Persian Gulf Division and aircraft were concentrated in the neighbourhood of Sur. A clear warning that their inland stronghold at Jaalan would be bombed from the air, and the threat of naval action against their seaboard forts, were sufficient to convince the Bani Bu Ali that His Majesty’s Government were in earnest, and they submitted unconditionally. 336. Throughout the summer and autumn, heavy demands were made on the flying-boat squadron in connexion with the new Imperial Airways route to India. Stopping places at Bahrein and Sharjah were developed, wireless stations erected, and emergency landing grounds reconnoitred and marked. The first Airways aircraft passed over the new route in the first week of October, and since then all arrangements have operated satisfactorily. It is hoped that the permanent rest- house, which is being constructed under the supervision of the Iraq Command at Sharjah, will be fit for occupation in the spring of 1933. 337. During the latter part of the year further progress was made in developing the air route along the South Arabian coast between Muscat and Aden, and it is expected that this new route will be ready for operation both by landplanes and flying-boats in the autumn of 1933. Surveys. 338. Work has continued throughout the year in the completion of the 1/500,000 maps of the Southern and Western Deserts. The field work for the Salman-Busaiyah sheets has been completed and sent to the War Office; a survey party has, since November, been at work on the Basra-Koweit sheet. 339. An air survey was carried out during the year of the Hammar Lake area, and a large-scale air survey in connexion with the proposed new cantonment site at Dhibban on the right bank of the Euphrates has been completed. Desert Searches. 340. Once during January and once during February, it was necessary to organise searches for aircraft lost in the desert between Rutbah and Transjoidan. On the first occasion a Moth belonging to the Iraqi Air Force was missing for four days. Aircraft from the Royal Air Force in Iraq Command and Transjordan Command, the Iraqi Air Force, and from the French forces in Syria took part in the search; the Moth was eventually discovered and escorted safely in to Rutbah. 341. On the second occasion a squadron of Wapitis flying from Rutbah to Amman ran into a blizzard and six of the aircraft were forced to land near the Syrian-Transjordan frontier. Searching aircraft were sent out from Amman and Rutbah and the missing aeroplanes were eventually all located. In these two episodes no lives were lost. 342. A weekly air mail between Bagdad and Cairo was maintained through out the year. The mail, which contained service secret and confidential corres pondence and Foreign Office bags from Bagdad and Tehran, was transferred to aircraft of the Middle East Command at Rutbah, which delivered them in Cairo for onward despatch by courier. The Iraq Levies. 343. At the beginning of 1932 the Iraq levies comprised 22 British officers, 10 British n.c.o.’s and 1,723 native ranks, who were almost entirely Assyrians. The force was organised as a headquarters, a pack ambulance and two battalions.w* 64 344. It was proposed to effect the transition from this force in o Defence Force provided for in the annexure to the 1930 Treaty of A lance, entailed a gradual reduction in strength to 1,250 Iraqi ranks and a so re recruitment of Arabs and Kurds in substitution for a proportion ot the I ssytians, in order to give a better tribal balance to the force, which was to be reorganise ^ into a battalion headquarters, a subsidiary headquarters for the Basra area, an eight companies. Discussions were held with the Iraqi Government regarding the legal measures necessary to establish the new force as a part of the Iraqi army, and to allow of all necessary British interests being safeguarded. 345. In June, however, the Assyrian personnel of the force, in furtherance of their political aspirations in Iraq, made a collective demand for their services to be terminated. It was not until considerable negotiations had taken place that the demand was withdrawn. During the course of these negotiations it was necessary to arrange to refer their grievances to the League of Nations and to promise that no further Assyrians would be discharged before the 15th December or the receipt of the League’s decision, whichever was the earlier date. 346. As a result, w T hen the year ended, the necessary reduction in Assyrian strength could not be carried out to the extent originally proposed. The recruiting of Arabs and Kurds had been undertaken only to the limited extent of forming half-strength cadres of two Arab and one Kurdish companies. The negotiations regarding the legalisation of the force had made very little progress. Other arrangements for the formation of the Air Defence Force had, however, gone forward satisfactorily; detailed establishments had been prepared, terms of service for all ranks had been promulgated, and the procedure for future recruiting had been worked out. The Iraqi Army. 347. During 1931 and 1932 the Ministry of Defence was continually pressed by the Iraqi Government, first, to increase the army to meet the danger of rebellious tribes, and, secondly, to reduce its budget owing to the financial situation. The problem was one of considerable perplexity as the budget had already been cut down from 149 lakhs in 1928 to 109J lakhs in 1930, and, there fore, the main avenues of retrenchment had been fully explored. It was found possible, however, with a budget limited to 103 lakhs, to expand by 2 battalions in 1931 and by a further 2 battalions in 1932; and also in these years to launch the Royal Iraqi Air Force. During the same period one cavalry regiment was disbanded, and, by the 31st December, 1932, the fighting troops comprised :— 2 regiments cavalry. 5 batteries artillery. 11 battalions infantry. 1 motor machine gun company. 1 signal battalion. 1 aircraft squadron. 348. Towards the end of 1931, all signallers were withdrawn from units and combined with the existing signal unit to form a signal battalion. The object being economy, the total number of signallers was reduced to a figure sufficient to supply battalions when at battalion training or on active service. The battalion is now organised as follows :— Headquarters and two companies— A Company : Headquarters and 3 platoons. No. 1 . W/T (10 stations). No. 2 . Infantry brigade section (including 4 W/T stations). No. 3. Infantry brigade section (including 4 W/T stations)! B Company : Headquarters and 4 platoons. No. 4. Three battalion sections. No. 5. Three battalion sections. No. 6 . Five battery sections. No. 7. Two cavalry regimental sections.65 i * t x \ ; i i ' 349. The Royal Iraqi Air Force was formed in April 1931 on the arrival from England of the first flight of five Gipsy Moths. 350. At the beginning of the year 1932 the establishment consisted of two flights of Gipsy Moths (each flight consisting of three aircraft with a 33 per cent, reserve), and one Puss Moth, whilst three Puss Moths for the third flight to complete the squadron by April 1932 were under construction in England. On the arrival of the Puss Moths in April the first squadron was formed, organised as a headquarters and three flights comprising a total strength of thirteen officers and forty-nine other ranks. In addition fifty-six apprentices were under training in various skilled trades with a view to the formation of the depot and second squadron in April 1933 and 1934 respectively. 351. The British staff at this period numbered three British officers and five British non-commissioned officers. 352. Apart from the operations in the Barzan area, in which the Royal Iraqi Air Force were called upon to co-operate, normal training was carried out throughout the year and good progress was made both in army co-operation and in bombing. 353. A considerable improvement was effected during the year in the general system of aircraft maintenance, mainly owing to the work of the British engineer officer, who was appointed on the 1st April, 1932. Workshops were established comprising an engine repair section and an aeroplane repair section, and complete overhauls of engines and aircraft were successfully carried out. 354. Owing to the serious resistance offered by the rebels in Kurdistan and to the impending withdrawal of the Royal Air Force on the termination of the Mandate, the Iraqi Government decided to accelerate the formation of the second squadron by one year. To give effect to this decision within reasonable financial limits it was settled :— ( 1 ) To purchase eight De Havilland Dragons to be in commission by the 1 st April, 1933. (2) To constitute three flights of Gipsy Moths as a training unit and to undertake the flying training of eighteen pupils in Iraq. Accordingly eight De Havilland Dragons were ordered together with three additional Gipsy Moths for the training units, and a British officer and two non commissioned officers as flying instructors have been authorised. 355. The organisation of the Royal Iraqi Air Force on the 1st April, 1933, will, therefore, be :— Headquarters— _ .,, , , 1 squadron comprising 2 flights each of 3 De Havilland Dragons with a 33 per cent, reserve. . 1 training squadron comprising 3 flights each of 3 Gipsy Moths with 33 per cent, reserve. 1 communication flight of 4 Puss Moths. 356. There was considerable enthusiasm for military aviation in Iraq, and each liwa is endeavouring to raise the sum of £3,000 for the purchase of one aeroplane to be named after it and to be presented to the Government. In two liwas over £ 2,000 had been raised for this purpose at the end of the yeai. 357. The operations against Sheikh Ahmad have been described elsewhere in this report. On their conclusion the withdrawal of units to peace stations was at once undertaken. By the end of July practically all the tioops in the Baizan area were back in Mosul, except for the 5th Battalion, which remained to garrison Billeh. On the Shirwan flank units had also returned to their barracks by the end of July, except for two battalions which remained in the theatre of operations till the end of October. 358. It has been pointed out that, after the successive defeats of Sheikh Mahmud and Sheikh Ahmad, the Iraqi Government pursued a wise policy of toleration, which, combined with the construction of roads and police posts, has brought large areas of Kurdistan under fairly effective control.66 359 . Hence, the task of preserving internal security—for which the army is at present mainly organised—has been to some extent simplified. ^ There has, consequently, been a recrudescence of the advocacy of conscription. The British Military Mission has always strongly advised against this policy, but, at the request of the Minister of Defence, it produced a scheme for conscription which is under consideration. 360. On the termination of the mandate, the British mission was reduced from twenty-nine officers to fourteen. The inspectorships of medical, veterinary and engineer services, and most of the assistant inspectorships, were abolished, and the inspectorships of armoured cars and mechanical transport were combined. These losses are not greatly felt because Iraqi officers have, as their training has progressed, been carrying out a continually increasing proportion of their work on their own initiative; and the change has the desirable effect of accelerating that process. There was no alteration in the cordial relations between British and Iraqi officers that prevailed prior to the expiry of the mandate. VII.— Miscellaneous. International Agreements and Conventions. 361. The accession of Iraq to the International Treaty for the Renunciation of War, signed at Paris on the 27th August, 1928, became effective on the 23rd March, 1932. 362. During the year 1932 the Iraqi Government decided to accede to the International Convention relating to the Simplification of Customs Formalities, signed at Geneva on the 3rd November, 1923, and to the Convention for the Supervision of the Trade in Arms and Ammunition, signed at Geneva on the 17th June, 1925. 363. The Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armies in the Field and the Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, both signed at Geneva on the 27th July, 1932, were still under consideration by the Iraqi Government at the close of the year. 364.
