No 0 C-66 of 1935 / 1 ;:^BT Office of the Political Reticent in the Persian Gulf. H. M* S* *BOKFOHD W &lt; March 1933. My dear Metcalfe, Please refer to my telegram So. 04, datea 20th January 1333, in which I stated that our failure to obtain air facilities at Kalda was due to the in- -fluence of the Shaikh of Has al Khaiman. 2. T he attitude of this Shaikh has been uneatis- -factory for some years past, ana he caused Biscoe a good deal oi trouble. He is one of the Shaikhs who refused to have the air port, now established at Shargah, in his territory, and nov; refuses to call on Ships v/hen they visit his port. He is the only Shaikh in the Chilf whc does not perform these official courtesies. 3. Hitherto the mostimportant easiness on tae Tiucial Coast has been to overcome the various difficult- -ies in the v/ay of the Sharg&amp;h Rest House being erected as soon os possible, and while this was being done Z was loath to have any more irons in the fire in that part ot the world. Now, however, that the Rest House is nearly completed, I think Pas al Knaim&amp;h might ce tackled. Arabs pay considerable importance to matters ol ceremony, ana the Shaikh^ deliberate omission to carry out official cout^esies is of course not good for our pies- -tige. Moreover it prevents me getting into personal touch with him; if I visit his port I ceitainly can t make the first call. .1 • Metcalf e, Esc . , f. * I. a •, H. 0*, , | J i Poreign Secretary to the Government oi India, I 4- ; New Delhi,2 % &gt; 4p The Shaikh has a salute of 3 guns, and as this salute is given especially for cells on H.id. Ships it v/ould make the punishment fit the crime if his guns were cancelled. Probably a threat to that purpose would make him toe the line, and have a good effect on the rest of the Trucial Coast» If he proved oodurate and did not toe the line, then of course his guns would be taken away. But is there such a procedure as temporary forfeit of guns ? I mean, if he should prove obaurat^ it would give me much more hola on the Shaikh to inform him that his guns hao been temporarily forfeited pending a change of heart on his part, than if I had to tell him that his guns were gone for good. In the former case I could still dangle a carrot in front of the Shaikh’s nose, in the latter there would be no carrot to dangle, 5 # Could you please let me have some ajdcf&amp;xxjs: information on this point and I will put in an official letter on the subject. Yours sincerely, Sa/- T.C.PowlCo 71c. C-69 of 1933. Copy forwarded witn compliments to the Political Agent, Bahrain, for information.

With reference to letter No,463 dated the 10th October 1933 from Captain B.H.Gastrell His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent,Bahrain, covering a letter from the Hon'hie the Political Resident in the Persian j Gulf addressed to Shaikh Sultan bin Salem, Ruler of Ras al Khaimah. I have the honour to inform you that on the 21st October 1933 the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, arrived at Ras al ^haimah. 1 called on board the ship and had an interview with him. The brother of the Ruler of Ras al Khaimah named Shaikh Muhammad bin Salem came up to see the Senior Naval Officer. After they had met together the Senior Naval Officer asked from Shaikh Muhammad as to the reason for the Ruler's non-attendance on board the ship in person. Shaikh Muhammad replied that his brother does not board war ships. Then the Senior Naval Officer told him that he had come to Ras al Khaimah to have a friendly interview with the Ruler and that the latter should entertain no fear whatsoever that anything would happen to him. Shaikh Muhammad bin Salem left the ship in order to pursuade his brother to call on board the warship. Afterwards I went ashore and tried j;y best to persuade the Shaikh but did not succeed as he did not agree to visit the sloop. I therefore informed the Senior 1 aval Officer and he came ashore in the afternoon and called at my house. The Ruler of Ras al Khaimah and his brothei came to interview the Senior Naval Officer there. The Senior Naval Officer did net agree to meet the Ruler and gave me the letter which had been sent through him. I handed the letter to the Shaikh in his presence. The Senior Naval Officer then enquired from the Shaikh as to what is this fear which had taken hold of him and that he would give him perfect assurance of safe conduct saying that nothing would happen to him and he may therefore call on board the warship and he would certainly be allowed to come back ashore. The Shaikh did not agree to do so and much ef effort was made to persuade the Ruler but no result was achieved. The Senior Naval Officer therefore left the Shaikh alone and went back to the warship. After the departure of the Senior Naval Officer the Ruler gave me a letter addressed to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf,being a reply to his letter which I submit herewith. The Senior Naval Officer instructed me to make en qhiries/- 2 - enquiries and find out if there is with the Shaikh a letter from the Persian Government offering to lease the Tamh Island from him. I heg to state that in accordance with the enquiries I have made the Shaikh has not got a letter from the Persian Government hut that he is saying that the Persian Government desire to lease the Island, presuming that hy this statement the British Government would (he persuaded to) lease the Island from him so that he should get some income. This is the information that I have been able to obtain as a result of my enquiries about this and I shall not neglect to make further enquiries in the matter. As soon as I get any information I shall submit a report or send you a telegram on the subject. I have sent a copy of this letter to the Political Agent, Bahrain. Usual endings.Copy.

The Shaikh is not paying any attention to me or looking after the Island nor does he give me pay etc., You know of course about my poor state, and being a well known man in the Island all tne Arabs who arrive come to my place and I am compelled to ^ do them the hospitality while I do not get anything for my maintenance. Besides, it is the time now for earning and to do so I have to go for diving. If I leave the I~sland there will be no one in my place to report to you matters which may happen in tne Island, especially in these days when the Persian Officials come to the Island and talk proudly claiming that the Island belongs to the Persian Government whereas I tell them tne reverse. They asked me that they wanted to go to the light house to see it and when I did not agree they attempted to do so by force and without my permission. If this be the case of the Persians, how would it be possible to leave the Island. Thirdly, the war ships of the British Government visit the [ Island frequently and their Captains always make enquiries from me. in the circumstances I request the British Government to consider the question of my pay or allow me to go to earn for |my living.

Tehran. 29th September,i.934 Sir I have the honour to transmit herewith a copy of the note which, in accordance with your instructions, I handed to the Prime Minister today. His Highness looked rather perturbed by its perusal and said that he knew nothing whatever about the matter and that it often happened that action was taken at a distance from the capital without the instructions and without the knowledge of the Central Govern ment; it was also quite possible that the Persian naval officers knew nothing more about Tamb and Abu Musa than that Persia claims sovereignty over them. I replied that it was impossible for us to act on the assumption that the Commander in-Chief of a naval force, whether great or small, was not aware of the general political situation in the waters where he operated. Moreover, as regards the second visit, it had taken place after our Senior Naval Officer had explained our point of view to Lieutenant Colonel Bayendor and after, as we knew positively, there had been contact between the Persian sloops. 2. His Highness then asked whether I had any details of the conversation between yourself and Bagher Khan Kazemi and he expressed the hope that the contact which had been established would prove valuable in promoting those friendly relations which Persia should have with all countries and more especially with Great Britain for whose work in the world he had the highest regard. I replied by giving him a/ The Right Honourable? Sir John SiffiohfG.C .S.I., etc•, etc., etc•, The Foreign Office- 2 - a rough translation of your telegram No.90 of September 26th. wishes of the Persian Government were in the matter of the treaty, explaining my bewilderment by a short recital of events since, shortly after I went on leave last year, His Highness told Mr. Mallet that relations had never been so good as they were at the moment (see Mr.Mallet's despatch No.294 of June 17th, 1933) . There had^/been the Basidu flag and Mudir incidents. The flag incident, with regard to which he must admit that we had been most moderate, was safely settled and the Mudir was still under discussion when the 'Evening Standard' indiscretion occurred. I discussed it strenously with His Highness himself and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and after about three weeks it proved possible for me to have an audience of the Shah. Our conversation seemed to show that His Majesty had almost forgotten both incidents and that what he had mainly in mind was that we should get on with the treaty negotiations. The i Minister for Foreign Affairs not long afterwards told me that he was anxious to begin treaty discussions at an early date, ’ but gradually his interest entirely evaporated and in its place we had the outrageous charge thatwe were stirring up disaffection in Baluchistan and Mr* Christopher Sykes was nearly expelled as a suspect. Finally I received from Kazemi a letter on the subject of the negotiations which, though vaguely worded, appeared to indicate that the Persian Government had decided to abandon them. Was His Highness surprised at my saying I was bewildered ? 4. I went on to say that shortly before he left for London, Hussein Khan Ala told me (I now remember it was Lieutenant-Cdlonel Loch) that the Persian Government had 3 I went on to say I was rather puzzled as to what the then been/'' % -3- been examining the draft tteaty and had reached the conclusion that much ol it was unacceptable and that the negotiations would almost have to begin afresh. His Highness replied that it was true that the treaty had been re-examined, in October, he thought, anci that it was considered that Persia was being asked to give much away and was to receive little in return, X replied that in my view Persia was being asked to surrender nothing concrete whatsoever - claims such as that to Bahrain which she actually did not wish to see realised - and she would receive in return definite, even if small, practical benefits, and I enquired whether the Shah was cognisant of the details of the draft treaty, Feroughi answered that the Shah never knew details and probably had only a general idea of what the draft contained, especially as he believed that Teymourtache did not make any special effort to keep His Majesty informed. 5, nfter some further conversation His Highness made the interesting statement that he was virtually certain that if we had agreed to surrender Tamb and Abu Musa when Teymourtache first suggested it, the treaty negotiations would have gone through. 6, I then reverted to the recent incidents at Tamb and said that if the xersian Government really desired &amp; treaty they must avoid creating incidents. His Highness repeated that he did not know for what purpose the sloop had landed a party at Tamb. I told him that the Commanding Officer of the second sloop had told the Captain of His Majesty’s Ship ’’Bideford” that he had come to look for a Persian deserter. His Highness then said that the Persian sloops were placed in a position of difficulty in as much as they could not make a normal notification without appearing to admit that Tamb and Abu Musa were foreign territory. I told His Highness that Tamb and Abu Musa were on precisely the same footing-4 as Sirri* He probably remembered that when His Majesty’s Ship 'Ormonde” visited the Gulf for surveying purposes, we requested permission for landings to be effected at a variety of Persian ports and islands and also requested the Persian Government to notify their officials on the Sirri island that she would also pay a visit there and we added a sentence to the effect that this communication did not ijnply a recognition of Persia’s de .jur e title to the island* I could not see why the lersian Government should not, if they required their sloops to go to Tamb and Abu Musa, do the same, nor could I see why the Persian Government should insist on pretending that the Arab rulers were not entitled to place the conduct of their foreign relations in our hands; even if the Persian Government were determined to maintain this attitude they would be well advised to seek to mitigate its inconveniences, which were not entirely one-sided. With regard to Tamb and Abu Musa, the other alternative was to keep away altogether other wise a serious incident seemed inevitable and the only possible result of an incident which I could see would be to establish the fact, which nobody wanted to prove, that the British naval forces were stronger than those of Persia, This I said half jokingly and His Highness responded. 7. Resuming in a tone of full seriousness, I said that, but for the conversation which you had had with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, it appeared possible th-ct I should have received instructions to communicate officially to the Persian Government the orders which had been issued to the Senior Kaval Officer. As matters now stood, His Majesty's Government wished to avoid making a communication of such a nature, but I had been instructed to inform His Highness orally of the nature of these instructions in order that there might be no possibility of a misunderstanding. I then read/read 'to liim sXovvXy pai*agr,^.p]is X and 2 of your 'teXegrain No *93 of September 26th. 8. A sXightXy painfuX siXence ensued which I broke by say ing that it was quite unnecessary that there shouid be troubie between us; there was more than enough troubie in the worid as it was. I iinaliy took my ieave after once again urging that the Persian sioops shouXd keep away from Tamb and Abu Musa and asking His Highness to acquaint himseif with the report which wouid doubtiess have been received from the i ersian Minister in London of his interview with you yesterday. I shouid add that at one stagej I mentioned the announce ment reported in my teiegrams Nos.127 and 128 of 27th Septem ber, that Consuis from the Foreign and Poiiticai Department were no ionger desired. Feroughi knew nothing about it but seemed to think that it wouid be an exceiient thing if poiiti cai officers from India were not sent here. I said that if the Persian Government desired a change they could have invited us to discuss the matter, but the action they had in fact taken was highly discourteous. 10.

In the ordinary course of events Sir John Simon would have awaited with interest a further communication from the Imperial Government on the subject of the treaty negotiations. 2. lie was, however, disquieted to learn on his return to London that, almost simultaneous ly with his conversation with the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, a Persian warship had paid yet a further visit to Iamb without prior notification and had landed a party on the island. 3. In the view of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom this visit, following on the previous visit of His Imperial Majesty’s ship 'Palang' on August 28th last (Shahrivar 6th) when an Arab dhow was searched in Tamb territorial waters, can only mean one of two things; either the xersian Government wish to create a fictitious value for their claim in future negotiations; or else they are unwilling His Highness Mirza Mohamad $li Khan Feroughi. to/to make use of the peaceful andlegal methods by which it is open to them to pursue it, and are determined to achieve their object by methods which are quite incomputable with their position as signatories of the Covenant of the League of nations and of the Kellogg pact. 4. it is impossible for His Majesty's Govern ment to acquiesce in either situation and I am instructed to make it clear that the total cessation of such tactics is an essential preliminary to the resumption of negotiations. 5. It is the earnest hope of His Majesty’s Government that the Imperial Government will recognise the justice of this view, and, if they do in fact desire to resume negotiations, take such steps as will make resumption possible I avail myself of this opportunity..etc. (Signed) R.E.Hoare•s$*K Copies to: India Mo.205* Bushire No,169.

Ill® position as regards tha parsiaa claim to tii@ islands of .amb and 4 bu ^iaa is fcsaaraUy similar to tnat as regards tde ^©rsiaa claim to ^adrain. our case, tdat is to say* rests on the fact that Persia has not x footnote (ses, however, paragraph# .| ? below ) • exercised effective x dom nion in these islands for at least lb4 years (as against 151 years in th$ case of ^hrain). It is doubtful, indeed, whether even before l?5o she exercised dominion at lamb and Abu Musa, whereas it is certain that she exercised dominion over Bahrain for a period before 17U3. The Persian case has never been put forward systematically, but it is understood to be based on the following two points (1) lame and Abu Musa were shown as Persian v \ on a far Office map presented to the onah in l&amp;bb; (E} the Jowasimi ^rab sheikns of /Ling&amp;hUng&amp;h fa port on the Persian coast), w&amp;o administered Tamb and Abu Musa for a lon r period before their final expulsion from Persia in l&amp;Bf, were, for a part of that period, Persian subjects ^overniu^ Lin^ah as Persian officials* xhe Persian Govermsient are under- stoo^ to contend that the Shaikhs administered Mfgf isl anas also in their capacity of Persian offiolals* 3. Point (1) is unfortunate, but its importance as an argument is largely counter acted by tue fact that both before and after the date on which the map was presented the Persian claim was emphatically and officially repudiated by His JJtjesty # s Government* 4* as regards fg) oar contention is that this is a complete misconstruction of the facts* which are as follows; §* Since the early part of the 18th century, and possibly earlier still, an Arab family or small elan fcnown as the ^awazim or * Jowasimi have rulejLorer a large part of what iheir subjects and tributaries are also generally called jowasimi but the name really applies to the ruling family only.is now ©omraonly oallsd ta« iruoial coast. 4 ,t first their headquarters were at Bas-ul-^haiiaah, but in X8£o the Sheikh of the day began to reside at Sharjah, ftas-ul-Kbaiisah being governed by one of his relatives. inis arrangement continued until laS9, when the Governor of Ras-ul-isihaimU mde himself independent of Sharjah, and from that date until the present time, with the exception of a brief period early in the present century, ^harjah and Ras-ul-^hairmh nave oeea ruled as mutually Independent Sheikhdoms by different branches of the jowesi mi family. b. Soon after the death of &amp;adlr Shah In 1747, some of the jowasimi led their foil overs (who then and thereafter were noted pirates and raiders) to the aid of tne Persian Governor of sunder Abbas and Horans, who was pressed for tribute by various Persian pretenders and involved in hostilities with various neighbouring chieftains, in the course of this and subsequent visits the jow&amp;sisi took possession of Lingah, opposite /theI iwUMUl■ of Q.isiiM, aad other places on tfce Persian coast. The# were hrivan away during the ascendency of K:arim Zhan iand, who ruled orer Persia from If63 to 1779, but after his death they returned, and held Ungau and the surrounding district as an Arab principality Mill 1 &amp;&amp;?. Towards the end of this period the Persian (^overniaent asserted themselves to some extent upon the coast of the Gulf and the Jowasimi Sheikhs of Lingafc finally became in effect Persian vassals, whose succession to the Sheikhdom was habitually recognised by the Shah in the form of an appointment as Governor of Lingah, who paid to the Shah’s viceroy at Shiraz such tribute as the latter could extract from them, and who acknowledged themselves to be Persian subjects. In 1867 the Persian Government deposed the last Sheikh and took over the government of Lingah themselves. 7. Throughout the period under review, that is to say from a date earlier than 1747 to the present day, the islands of lamb and Abu Musa, like the neighbouring Arab coast, have /been8. ooen la the possession and effective occupation of the ruling jowaeiml Sheiichs* the latter have always held them, however. In acoordanoe with &amp;rab custom, on behalf of their elan as a whole, not as their purely personal property, for many years prior to 1667, the management, administration, and jurisdiction of the two islands was by common consent vested in the chief Jownsimi Sheikh of the Persian coast, that is, the Sheikh of Lingah, a near relative of the sheikhs at Sharjah and Hae-ul- khaimeh* this administration was carried out on behalf of the family as a whole. After the extinction of the lin^ah principality in la&amp;7, the administration of iamb was transferred from Lingah to Bas-ul-khaimah, while Abu kusa was attached direct to Sharjah. This administrative division was maintained when Sharjah and Baa- ul-khalrash were temporarily re-united in the present century and when they a^aln became separate, with the result that *bu Hus* now belongs to the Sheikh of Sharjah and Taab to tae Sheikh of Bas-uWhairaan8 . ti^refore, tae Siieiitua of juAa£&amp;h &amp;Cu r ;„iiiist^rod limb nod Abu Musn W62*&lt;i at ooa period l^araian vaasal® nod eveo Persian officials, tills fact was lo ao way w&amp;atsver raspoasibla for tiiair connexion witii to© two islands* lb© Jowaslmi owned immb and aou Musa long before any of their number established themselves on Persian soil; the dominant ShelAh of the elan (and the greater part of the elan) never ceased to reside on the iruoial Coast; the rights of the Ungah SfeeUfee, which were in any case derived from their family connexion and not from their position in Persia, were at all times shared with, and subordinate to, the rights of the SheiJchs on the iracial Coast; and when the lingah ahei&amp;hs were finally driven from Persia, any shadow of connexion between their rights and Persia went with them* For the rest, the vowasimi have never acknowledged Persian sovereignty over the islands, and documentary evidence of their rights has been produced to the Besidenoy Agent on the Iruoial Coast^^ fii.aor difference between Bahrein on the one hand, and Tamb and Abu Musa on the other, ia that while Bahrain lies close to the ;f Arabian shore, Tamb and Abu ^-lusa are well out in the Gta If ; Tamb is a good deal closer to the Persian t ian to the Arabian coast, Abu Musa is slightly nearer the Arabian. 10. The Persian claim to these islands was first asserted in 1867, the year in which the Jowasimis of Lingah were finally driven out of Persia; and has been re-asserted on five occasions between then and now. on the first of these occasions, in 1904, both lamb and Abu Musa were temporarily occupied by the Persians, who, however, were induced, without the use of force, to withdraw after about a month. Less serious attempts to assert Persian sovereignty were made oy Persian customs officials on three other occasions, in each case the Persian Government reserved their rights, but* as already stated, they have never set forth their case in a full and systematic fashion. 11 . It should perhaps be added that /untiluntil Ifcfc? tiie history of the neighbouring Island of klrrl was identical with that of lamb and Abu Musa* (Sirri, like lamb, is rather nearer to Persia than to Arabia), It was the Persian seizure of 3irri in that year, and the establishment of a Persian customs post, which gave rise to the whole dispute. On wider political ground© His Majesty 1 * government acquiesced de facto in the Persian occupation, but they have never recognised it ae ju re, in the draft a agio-Persian general treaty (now virtually abandoned) it was proposed to perpetuate the existing d e facto position, Persia recognizing that iamb and Abu Musa belonged to the Jowasimi Sheikhs of Oman while His Majesty*© Government {on behalf of the Sheikh of Sharjah) recognised Sirrl as Persian. The possibility of leasing 'iamb to Persia was also examined in connexion with these negotiations, but it is unlikely that the Sheikh of Baa-ul-Ah&amp;imah would lease the island on any terms acceptable to the Persian Govermneati*. ih&amp; GoTerniaeat of India amintain a liglit•house on 1'aab, valah is othei^iss of little importance, having only some flft^ inhabitants* I he Shelich of as«ul-^ha i inah lies his flag there continuously.

Ras al Khaimah say have removed flag staff to attract attention and to get someone to visit him to air grievances at not receiving rent for light-house. This gi-r grievance is prompted by Sharjah getting rent for aerodrome. Ras C\ al Khaisah’s method to attract attention is l bei ng private b ecause Ras al Khaimah has not opportunity, of conmiunicating by Sloop. (b) Fas al Thai man does not went to abandon Tanb but wants to sake money out of it. As British will not pay rent for light- Ig , house Persians are next best possible source of income. Has ai Khaimah does not want Sharjah to occupy Island especially as Sharjah would not pay for it. Paragraphs 2, 5 and 4 follow immediately. Ho:1152 . 2. Isa peports : ~ _ ... (a) Sharjah and Dlbai have heard of Ras al Khaimah’s action and disapprove. (b) Sharjah wants to proceed at once to erect his own flagstaff at Tanb but Isa told him not to. (c) Flagstaff was erected by present Shaikh of Sharjah’s father 30 years ago when he owned Tanb. 3.

I am posting note which should reach you February 14th, gist of which is as follows Tanb belongs to Jowasimi tribe of which chief Shaikhs are Sharjah and Has al Khaimah and is locally regarded as connected to latter. Up to 1921 we treated Ras al K(haimah) as part of S(har.iah) and accordingly in 1912 it was from latter that concurrence in erection of lighthouse on T(anb) was obtained. In 1921 Government of India recognised Ras al £(haimah) as separate Shaikhdom. If Has al K(haimah) secedes them presumably other J(owasimi) Shaikh, i.e., S(harjah) can resume possession of Island.

Reference your Confidential memorandum No.l29-S dated the 24th January 1936, I append with this a short note on the subject of the Arab custom of a tribe or community holding property 'in common' which I trust may be of assistance• 2. The subject however is really a big one, and cannot be dealt with properly in the form of a note, however full. sd. H.R.P.Dickson, Lt.-Colonel. Political Agent, KuwaitIV./ (Ufr) NOT£ ON THti ARAB CUSTOM OF HOLDING PROPERTY' IK COMMON” . I. The subject is not an easy one and much, no doubt, could be written about it, if one had the leisure. Putting the case as shortly as possible, however, one may say that land is held in the Arabian Peninsula under two main systems: (a) That of private ownership; (b) That of Tribal ownership. II. Under system (a) which is confined almost entirely to the settled or Town population of Arabia, an individual buys or inherits his lands in the first place, (it may also be a bequest) and on his death, it (the land) must according to 'Sheria' Law, be divided among his heirs. The males getting so many shares and the females ditto. III. These heirs however very often arrange among themselves, for either political or 'family protective reasons', not to divide the property, and elect to leave it in the hands of the senior member of the family to be administered and managed as the latter considers fit, they the heirs getting their individual rights in the shape of fixed share of the produce, or a salary, or both. So long as the property is administered reasonably well and individuals are properly treated, the system works satis factorily. But should the reverse take place, then there is trouble as division into fair shares often becomes a most difficult matter, especially after several generations have held the property, without dividing it. The same 'protective instinct' which tends to keep property in the hands of the head of the family, can similarly be traced in the age long and practically universal system among Arabs(especially the tribes) of first cousin marriages the idea being to prevent the girl going away from the family, or out of the tribe, and so taking her share oi the property with her, which would inevitably and in weakening the family or home tribe (hamoula)- 2 - iv. In Kuwait we have many examples of this joint possession ot property, notably the date gardens of the Shaikhly house of the ill Subah on the Shatt al Arabj which by consent of the whole family, have been managed and administered for many years by the Ruler himself. The same system is today also in existence in Riath, where I understand Bin Saud looks after the garden and house property of all the members of the Al Saud family, and the same also was the fashion during Turkish times among the great famil ies of the Al Saadun and Naqibs of Basra. v * It should never be forgotten however that according to the strict letter of the Sheria Law the system is wrong (just like the veiling of women), and any individual, who happens to be dissatisfied with his lot, can theoretically claim to be given his lawful share of the family prpperty whatever it be and at any time, In practice'-it-is not so easy, especially when the family as a whole has approved the system, or the head of the house happens to be a ruler of a State like Bin Saud, the Imam Yahya, or Ibn Subah. vi. It is quite clear that the system of trying to keep the family property together, originated in the days when anarchy and disorder existed in Arabia, and when it was necessary and very essential to keep the family strong, for protective purposes. We see signs of the same fear in the fortress like way all Arab houses are built (i.e. the absence of all outside windows and the small door in the Centre of the big door). vii. lit is further quite clear also that the system is so deeply rooted in the heart of every Arab, as to be at once his strength and his weakness - His strength because it keep the family life healthy and strong, his weakness because it teaches him to believe that all Kings^ Governments etc. as we know /© 144. know them are tyrannous and. hostile alv/ays to individual interests. It, in other words, tends to perpetuate the patriarchal or tribal system, which admits only the Shaikh or the head of the family(hamoula) as the authority to be obeyed. Hence the perpetual hostility, for instance, of the tribes of Arabia, to being ruled by a King like Ibn Saud, and hence the lack of ’’patriotism” as we know it, and the impossibility of getting tribes ever to cooperate together in big or small things - The beginning and end of a man’s ideas on life being the family and the tribe. VIII. To turn now to system (b) - See para 1 above: A ’’tribe” always owns its grazing and tribal lands (including wells etc.) jointly, and never individually. And in consequence the tribe as a whole jealously guard its possessions against aggression from outside tribes. Under the system also the position of the tribal boundaries are known exactly, by every man woman and child, and are handed down from father to son. Wells also are more often than not marked with tribal mark (Wasm) in similar way to their camels. The Shaikh of the tribe may of course detail certain wells and grazing areas during the Summer months to certain sections and families of the tribe, as he thinks tit, but this is purely for convenience sake. He may of course not sell or part with any portion ol fhe tribe s lands or grazing grounds to anyone. Every man knows this. The tribes lands are his ’’trust”. IX. Under the same system, if a neighbouring tribe, on friendly terms, happens to be short ct grazing in its own country, it is always permitted to enter the tribal lands of its neighbours on payment of a nominal tribute to the Shaikh of the tribe acting the part of ’’host”. This (although /-4- (although Bin Saud and other Arab rulers in their efforts to Europeanise their States are trying to stop it and replace it by 'Zikat' to the Central Government) isknown under the name of ' Dhabiha wa Maniha ,t , It is a very ancient custom indeed, and entitles the visitors to fUll protection, whilst sojourning in their neighbours land, even against enemy raiders, or the police activities of the King or Central Government (such as in Saudi Arabia)* This incidentally accounts for the lack of sympathy and almost invariable hostility which Kings like Bin Saud, Riza Shah, and Governments like Iraq who are tyring to run their country on Western lines, feel for the tribes* The tribal system is a perpetual thorn in their side* X. Only one person can interfere with actual tribal property, or give it away in Arabia today, namely the 'King 1 ’ or 'Ruler” of the country of which the tribe forms part (e*g* Bin Saud). Such an 'outrage' against tribal feeling and sentiment would however be so widely resented, and be so dangerous, that it is unthinkable that it would ever be put into practice. FOR EXAMPKR * Bin Saud might want to punish a tribe like the Ajman, and might order the Aw a zim, their neighbours, to take over half of its grazing lands. The order would no doubt be carried out, just because the King is all poweriul, but would remain in force just so long as Bin Saud could enforce the order. All the time the Ajman would be longing for the day when they would get back their lost lands. The Awazim would equally well realise that they were trespassers on lands whic no King on earth could give them permanently: They would withdraw as soon as they saw that Bin Saud grew weak or died, as they courd not face the ordeal of the bitterest of tribal wars that would ensue with all public opinion(tribal) against them-5- XI In the articular case of TkMB Island - although I am not up in events, nor have any knowledge of the question under discussion, I should say that the Island was either Owned by the Jowasim tribe as a whole, just like the Mutair own the 'Summan' region North of the Dahana, and so could not be given away or sold without the consent of the whole tribe, which it is most unlikely would ever be given, or That it was the personal property (acquired) by conquest or purchase orignally) of the actual Shaikhly family of the Jowasim. In which case the Shaikh as the head of the family and trueste 6 would be quite unable to part with the whole or part of it, without first obtaining the consent of the other members of the family,- Also an unlikely , contingency, unless a sufficiently good price were offered as an inducement sd.H.R.P.Dicks or Lt,-Colonel t Political Agent, Kuwait.

An outstanding example is the A1 IChalifah (Bahrain ruling family) custom that ensures that A1 Khalifah property shall remain intact. If the A1 Khalifah Buler grants a portion of the land of the A1 Khalifah to a member of the Family, on the death of that member tne land reverts to the Ruler, who can then (a) resume it himself, (B) re-grant it or portion of it to that member 1 s heirs, or (c) otherwise redistribute it (but always ii 1 Jtue A1 Khalii ah family ) • No A1 Khalifah land may be sold or given away outside the A1 Khalifah family. Tnis custom does no a, of course, apply to land which a member of the A1 Khalifah family may have obtained by private purchase or other such means. Ik is, however, curious to note that with the coming of settled conditions, it is becoming increasingly difficult to main tain this old custom. 3. The Sa*ud custom is said to be that the property in the possession of any of the members of the family cannot be trans ferred to an outsider. Even property given by the Ruler of the State to a person outside the family reverts to the Sa f ud family after the death of the person to whom the property is given and his family cannot enjoy the same right. 4. The Residency Agent, Sharjah, states that on the Trucial Coast the custom is tnat the family property reverts to that /member2 . mercher of the family i/?ho is in power and can protect the property against outside aggression, 5. Tae above is a brief outline, but sufficient perhaps to afford considerable support to the view that Qavasim property cannot be alienated av/ay from the Qawasim* 6, I regret the delay in replying to your enquiry, but tnere has been a neavy press of work recently* Political Agent, BahrainTelegram xx To From Political Resident, at Bahrain.

When Khan Bahadur Usa came to see me at the end of Ramadhan (December) he inquired from me about the matter and I told him that the flagstaff will have to be replaced. You have also referred to the matter again now from which I understand that the British Government consider it necessary for them that my flag should be replaced which I have accordingly ordered to be replaced. As you are aware my ofliciais who are staying there have always been asking me for pay. In the past years the income of the diving was good and I was not in need for anything and so I used to pay myseli to the officials in tne said Island. The diving is very bad at present ana the income is very small as a result oi which 1 find myself compell&amp;e to ask the assistance of the Honourable the Political Resident oi the high British Government in the matter of the upkeep oi the oiiicials.

As I know nothing of minerals, I shall be grateful if you can ask the Gil Company at Abadan to send one of their geologists who has a knowledge of sucii things, to my country lor exploration. But I request that you will arrange that the expenses of the geologist should be borne by tne Company andnot by me in case he comes because, as you know the matters ana the conditions of our sides, I cannot lose anything in these circumstances. I negotiated with the French Admiral Rivet who came to my place on a warsnip which arrived on 8th Thul iaaa 1353 (11th February 1935J(ana anchored)©!! my town Has-el-Khaimah. In the course of talk, conversation came over the question of exploration of minerals etc. I asked them whether they had anybody who had a knowledge in minerals and they replied that they had none at present- but that after four months they could send a geologist. They demanded from me a letter in this connection. But, as you are aware, my predecessors as well as myself are connected with the British Government by ties of friendship, i find it better if the communication is started by them and through you.

The Government want an emergency grounu at Kalba. Does Kalba belong to Sharjah or to Ras-al-Khaimah ? K*S.Husain Sharjah, Ras-al-Khaimah and Kalba belong to Al Qawasim Shaikh Sa T id bin Hamad is the cousin of the Shaikh of Sharjah. Shaikh Saqr, the great grand-father of the present Shaikhs, divined his dominions among his sons before he died. Kalba was given to his son Majid who is the grand-father of Shaikh Sa T id bin Hamad, the present ruling Shaikh. Shaikh Sa f id bin Hamad is also marriea to the sister of Shaikh Sultan bin Salim of Ras-al-Khaimah. He is not under Ras-al-Khaimah nor does he pay any Zakah to Sharjah. He Isitens to the Shaikh of has-al-Khaimah because he is his brother-in- law and helps him whenever he is in need. They frequently exchange visits with each other and that is why the Shaikh of Kalba listens to the advice of the Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah. I think that if Khan Bahadur writes a it letter and senos/with a man, the Shaikh of Malba may agree to allow a landing ground in his country. 4th March 1935. The following is the conversation which took place between the Shaikh of Sharjah ana P.A.:- for Kalba yet the present Shaikh, Sa T id bin Hamad,is an independent person and pays no Zaka but takes the revenues for his own expenses. Two years ago I gdat one of my brothers about the landing ground but the Shaikh of Kalba did not agree because he was aaviseu by the Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah not to allow one. P.A Is Kalba under Sharjah and does the Shaikh of Kalba pay amy Zaka to Sharjah ? Although the Shaikh of Sharjah is the person responsible ShaikhBBBKSfi&amp;nCfil - ■■ ■ *''* ' Shaikh ^Yhy does the Shaikh of Bas-al-Khaimah ao that and why does he listen to him if he is not under Ras-al- Khaimah? As the Shaikh of Ras*al*Khainiah is not on good terms with the Government he hoes not like that others should win the favour of the Government. If you wish me to ao so «»■ will send my brother (Muhammad) when he returns be irom the Hajj which will/about the month of Muharram (April). iVhen my brother goes he will be able to in a k p some arrangement otherwise he will be able to discover what is in his mina and I will let you know about it. 4.3.1935 aMarch 1935.

The letter has been sent to P.R by R.A. ’-y ’t- \ %Xm. ?/ zA. I spoke to the Political a esident on the 20th April 1^35 concerning the note at p«j4/n and the letter to which it refers. In consonance with P.R T s verbal instructions I spoite to K.S Yusuf Kanoo today and told him that the P.P v.-ould be most grateful if he went to Has al Khaimah, and established contact with the Shaikh. I told him that he could reassure the Shaikh that all that was required of him was that he should call on the P.P. at the first possible opportunity. Until he made it clear to the P.R that he wished to maintain the former friendly relations it was difficult for the P.P to assist him in his many wants. The P.R would be delighted to help him in the matter of a geologist if the Shaikh would only reassure the P.R by re-establishing friendly relations. G.
