Pelly also includes assessments of the attitudes of local tribes and inhabitants to the construction of the line through their areas and incidental notes on how settlements came to be located where they are and how they acquired their names.Following on from Pelly's report there is a report by Dr William Henry Colvill, Civil Surgeon at Bushire, which contains detailed geological information on the rock formations of the proposed route, with information on rock samples that were taken. Also included in the report are rough indications of average temperatures during the day-time and physical descriptions of the peoples living along the route.The report concludes with detailed information on Pelly's itinerary, estimates of revenue, population for the areas travelled through, lists of villages, and information on existing caravan routes.A sketch map which accompanies the report can be found at Mss Eur F126/106</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Jask</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bandar Abbas</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Wireless telegraphy</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001524.0x0003bf#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
