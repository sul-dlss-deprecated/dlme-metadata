I replied by telegram say ing that there v/ere^none in Karachi, but that the five seater cost 4950/- in India. I saw these, and though the engine is good the paintworx is so poor tnat it is al ready coming off, and the car had started to rust underneath. The Oakland is a similar car but has a better finish. The engine is slightly smaller than the Buick, but as there are no hills in Bahrein this does not matter. I enclose the picture of the touring mod- del which gives a good idea of it. I men tioned. in the telegram that I had as^ed the Agent to give your Excellency some concession, and amongst others he pro mised to paint the undercarriage with spe cial Eitumastic paint.
