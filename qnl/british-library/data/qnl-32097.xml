The suggestion made by the Admiralty that treaty negotiations should be started^ while maintaining our present position at Basidu 3 did not appear practicable, SIR BOLTON EYRES MONSELL intervened to say that the Admiralty Memorandum* as presented to the Sub-Committee* did not fully explain the position* and required to be considered in conjunction with a letter wnich xie had addressed to Sir John Simon and which* with the permission of the Chairman* he would read to the Sub-Committee. The letter ran as follows s- n I suggest that the matters mentioned in your immediate letter of November 25th appropriately be considered at the same tinn. I understand the Minister’s suggestion to be that the Shah should be told q repented of the action which the Senior Ncavai, Officer* under ins_lm cdion^fr^mHis ^ Government, took in sending the Mudlr ox^ Yd~Band'aF'ibbas* and you also propose to withdraw the guard from Basiciu, I see no objection to the action recon®ended by the Minister but I thinm it worn- _ mistake'to offer to withdraw the guard, etc.,frcia Basidu at jfof_ 8 fiae_in terv lew because it v/ould deprive us of a card, evSTthoogh it be 01 doubtful value, in negotiating for a treaty. I would suggest entering into treaty negotiations imediately after this communication - stressing two points with regard to Henjam «- (1) no a t’^ e e OOCUpa J ion of must l 3 e iiee from petty restrictions and annoyances s and if this is so (2) That there is no reason why the naval orees of His Majesty* s Government and Persia should not work together in concord for their mutual benefit, in suppressing slavery, gun running, etc. These however are questions of procedure which wouad be discussed when we meeto’* Continuing, Sir Bolton Eyres Monsell said that his point was that if the Sub-Commit tee agreed with the Foreign Office view reached c n the recoLimendation of Sir Kogjnaid Hoare, His Majesty f s Government should express regrets for what had taken place, and thereby put the Shah into the requisite humour for opening treaty negotiations. It would be a pity to withdraw from Basidu as he felt that by remaining in Basidu we would continue to hold a card, even though that card was not of very high value. SIR JOHN SIMON said he thought it was quite clear that before negotiations could be opened something would have to be done about the Basidu incident, and the question for the Sub-Committee to decide vms what was ■fco be done. THE G1LA.IRMAN said that as he understood it, the idea was that His Majesty* s Government should express regrets in some form or other whether or not treaty negotiations were to be proceeded with. SIR BOLTON EYRES MONSELL said that he thought it was the set of removing the Mudir to Bandar Abbas which particularly annoyed the Persian Government. SIR JOHN SIMON observed there appeared to be general agreement that the Basidu incident would have to be deposed of before treaty negotiations could be resumed, and. there were a number of ways in which it might be - 2 -In this possible to dispose or this question* connection he felt that Mr* Mallet, in his telegrams, had been right tnrougnoat, and this was 'borne out by a telegram which had been received since Sir hcg.fnaM' Iloare f a return to Tehran, Sir Reginald Hoare’s and hr. millet s views were that some definite gesture vuuld have to be made to the Shah, This might be done either oy giving the Shah an assurance of the feelings of His Majesty* s Government and indicating that there was no intention to humiliate Persia or, on the other hand, it might be necessary to take more definite action oy withdrawing the guard from Basidu which had been put there after the incident of hauling down the flag by a Persian officer,, SIR BOLTON EYRES MONSELL observed that the guard had been at Basidu orf ano. on oefore the flag incident occurred, and was not solely connected with that particular incident, although it had been the reason for the guard being placed and retained there all this time. He wondered whether the Shah could not be placated by words without necessarily being informed that action such as the removal of the guard would be taken. He suggested that it might be possible to express regrets and at the same time remove the guard or take such action as was considered desirable, but that no reference should be made to the action which would be taken when the expression °f regret was made to the Shall* SIR JOHN SIMON said that, while agreeing with Mie Pirst Lord’s remarks, it had to be remembered that they could not expect the support of the Law Officers regarding Basidu, as the Lav/ Officers had indicated /ep N clearly that we had little, if any, right on r^7our side regarding Basidu and none as regards Hen jam* Continuing, he said he had Brought with him the draft of a telegram which, if agreed to, migh. he sent to Sir Reginald Hoare and which he thought the Sub-Committee might like to consider. The telegram read as follows s- 'You should now make to the Persian as V ?or?hi^ e h! h r ° rally or w riting test 5 a communication on following lines* Begins. his majesty s Government have consiaered in consultation with you the oest means of ending recriminatinnc- which have followed upon recent unfortu nate incidents at Basidu.

You should make a supplementary oral communication on lines suggested in your telegram No. 327 down to words repeated trespass'adding: 'His Majesty’s Government wish to assure Persian Government expressly that it is alien to their policy and traditions, and.was absent from their intentions, to humiliate a friendly nation.' s Telegram No. 327 reads as follows Having read the whole file I cannot see why His Majesty’s Government should hesitate Tr ° sa Y that instructions for dealing with yiuciir obviously had to be issued without delay on. telegraphic reports, and liaving how examined issue in the light of detailed reports they realise that their sole purpose, which was to maintain interpretation of quo . would have been equally well dutained had they simply sent Mu dir back o ins post and protested against repeated trespass, » -4-Of -f* V) Continuing, SIR JOHN SIMON said tiiat the questions/ guard and ode sloop remained for discussion ? and quoted from Sir R. Hoare f s telegram ? Wo. 327, as follows li^ message went on to say that successful conclusion oi treaty negotiations would settle status of Basidu in Persia’s favour, and especially if guards were simuduaneously withdrawn, X am almost certain that the Shah would drive his Government heaulon^ into o. general settlement* Any how 1 see nothing to lose by trying. Alternative seems to 'be, as Mr. Mallet has pointed out, to risk all the evils resultant from driving the Snah into a rage in which he issues wild orders which his Ministers neither dare nor are physic ally in a posioion to withdraw. in oil dispute we bore this factor in mind with the happiest results. u.he tact thao tne country is aosolutely domina— ted by one man who in some circumstances rages like a lunatic is oi course a great pity, but it is a fact. if ike question was, w/ould the ohan or the Persian Government be satisfied unless the guard and sloop v/ere withdrawn. THE CHAIRMAN said that it appeared firstly, that we had taken action against the Mudir which was illegal, and, secondly, that we desired to uphold the alleged rights regarding Basidu, which could not be upheld in law. LORD HAILSHAM suggested that it might be possible to say that the armed guard and sloop would be withdrawn as Soon as Treaty negotiations had been commenced. SIR JOHN SIMON pointed out that both Sir Reginald Hoare and Mr. Mallet were of the opinion that it would La necessary not only to withdraw/ the guard but also the wloop before the Persian Government would even consider tne question of resuming treaty negotiations, and had indicated that they did not think mere words, in the -orm of an apology, would be sufficient. -5THE Cii.i.Lp*vLiN said. ]~.g v/i sfr 6 d t&gt; o be clear as to the situation if the armed guard were withdrawn, then he in Basidu? Sloop and the vvhat would our position Ihxl'ihWAITE said that the British flag would still oe ilown at Basidu. The Secretary of State AA- »JL I^AJXa. lor ±ndia in hib fiote ? circulated as Paper Hoe jf ft-rj ol | had sag^es ued that they should proceed on a Basis of iniorming the Persian Government that His Majesty’s Government were prepared to trust to the good faith of th- Persian Government and therefore to withdraw the armed, guard land sloopj. hut that the flag would he left flying. ^ LORD HAIL SHAM asked what the position would he ii the flag were again hauled down. MPh RENDEL observed that on the occasion of the ilaa hein^ hauled down the Oflicer who had committed this act had been severely reprimanded«, and should such an incident happen again it could only he on the direct instructions of the Shah. SIR JOHN SIMON said that it was very evident, tnat the Persian Government had every intention of rex erring the matter to the Council if His Majesty’s Government did not make a suitable gesture. It had to ue remembered that the lav/ officers had stated that we Had no legal right to Basidu&lt;, and if the Persians did refer the matter to the Council the same situation would arise as when we referred the question of the Anglo- Persian Oilfields to the Council 5 but the boot would oe on the other foot. It seemed to him imperative that we should prevent such a reference to the Council^ otherwise we should risk losing both Basidu and -o-Hen jsm? alternative of going to Balxreln was both inconvenient and expensive. It seemed that the only thing was to placate the Shah in order to be in a position to re-open treaty negotiations 3 but in so doing there would be no need to give up all rights regarding Basidu. He suggested that the removal of the armed guard, in itself, would not necessarily surrender 0 m 1 alleged rights in Basidu, as we would retain the coal store, and, has had been pointed out, the flag would be left flying. He observed that a telegram had just been received reporting a further incident with regard to interference with a Persian Inspector of Taxes boarding dhows in what the Naval authorities termed 'British waters'. He suggested that the Comrnander-in- Chief should be informed that in fact there was no such thing as British waters off Basidu, and if the Naval authorities persisted in using ohis term and talcing action on the lines reported, he despaired of ever getting any agreement. He thought this aspect of the situation might be communicated to the Commander-in-Chief, as it was most desirable to get the whole matter cleared up e SIR BOLTON EYRES MONSELL said that this most recent incident had passed off without any particular comment. MR. RHNDEL observed that up to the present it was not known what repercussions there would be in Tehran following upon this incident. SIR BOLTON EYRES MONSELL, asked whether it was known that the Shah would not be satisfied with an apology and an expression of regret by His Majesty s Government. -7LORD LONDONDERRY observed that Mr- MoJLlett and Sir Ragirald Hoare had expressed the opinion that the Shah would he quite amenable if handled in the right ay* SIR JOHN SIMON said that he was hound to take notice of the opinion expressed by the man of the sp-ot^ and in Sir Reginald Hoare’s opinion there was no hope of placating the Shah by a mere expression of apology. The only hope of re-opening treaty negotiations appeared to be to close the Basidu incident ? by the removal of the armed guard and the sloop s as suggested by Sir Reginald Koareo It might* on the other hand* be sufficient to remove the guard* but allow the sloop to remain. MR. RENDER observed that until the incident of the flag being hauled down there had been no armed guard in Basidu for a very long period. After the flag incident it had been stationed there very ostentatiously find the Persians had protested vehemently. The fact of the guard being there had kept open the question of the status quo . Mr. Mallett had said that if the guard was now withdrawn the Shah would see to it that there would be no further incidents* such as had taken place. LORD LONDONDERRY asked whether it was suggested that the flag should be left flying without an armed guard to ensure that it was not hauled down in the future. SIR JOHN SIMON pointed out that it was actually the Commander-In-Chief of the Persian Navy who had been responsible for hauling down the flag* and he had been very severely reprimanded. we* very rightly* had hoisted it again and had landed the armed guard. In view of the -8'action t» 8 .iC 6 n 'by the onaii he felt that# if &amp;xiy further incident did occur- it could only be with the authorisation of the Shall, and, for that reason, he felt that the flag would be fairly safe. He suggested, therefore, that the armed guard might he removed 5 but that the sloop should^ perhaps ? remain* • tV ‘ ri * ansv/er to a question 5 said that lie understood uiiat the sloop anchored some eight cables trom the fj.ag Soafic T no ugh there was nothing new m the Ifi-ng oil Basidu 5 a new departure had been tnat one S-lOoo u.ov-i remained at Basidu until relieved Dy c not her. He wondered whether it might not be possibie for the sloop to withdraw in order to ease the situation. THE CHAIRMAN said that in the tvent oi a further flag incident occurring it would be necessary to land the armed guard again 3 and if the - sloop was withdrawn how would it be known that the flag had^ in fact 3 been hauled down. LAuf ilAlnohAM ooserved tnat when the previous incident occurred the news had spread in a remarkably short time and had been detrimental to our prestige in the Persian Gulf. SIR BOLTON EYRES MONSELL said he felt there was &lt;* danger that the flag might be hauled down 3 not necessarily on the Shah’s instructions. bIR JOHN SIMON pointed out that Sir Reginald Hoare in ilis telegram No. 327 had stated that he could not Majesty’s Government should hesitate to say Micit instructions for dealing with the Mudir obviously lad to be issued without delay on telegraphic reports* -9-and having now examined the issue in the light of detailed reports they realised that their soi.e purpose, which was to maintain interpretation of the status quo „ would have been equally well attained, had they simply sent Mudir hack to his post and protested against repeated trespass. SIR BOLTON EYRES MONSELL observed that they were all agreed that some form of apology should be made, but the difficulty was should they, or should they not, withdraw from Basidu before treaty negotiations were re-opened. THE CHAIRMAN said that the Sub committee appeared to be reaching agreement. They were all agreed that the flag should be left flying, that treaty negotiations should be re-opened as soon as possible, that if the flag were hauled down it would be necessary to land the armed guard again, and that the fact of the flag being left flying was sufficient to maintain our alleged rights in Basidu. As, in the opinion of the men on the spot, it was necessary to placate the Shah by removing the armed guard, it appeared to him to be the best thing to do with a view to re opening treaty negotiations. SIR BOLTON LYRES MONSELL pointed out that if the armed guard and sloop were both withdrawn, and a further incident occurred, similar to the last, and the flag was hauled down, and it became necessary to land the armed guard again, there would he no hope whatever of re-opening treaty negotiations. LORD LONDONDERRY enquired whether, if the guard were withdrawn, the flag would be any safer if the sloop were allowed to reinain° - 10 -Q XXV was very doubtful if the mere presence of the s 1 oot&gt; would ensure the flag not being interfered with, b.iS JOHN SIhON said he had been wondering whether it might not be possible to remove the guard and to take no official action as regards the sloop, but to suggest to the Commander-in-Chief that the sloop should withdraw for a day or two and then return, as thought necessary. Undoubtedly it was the armed guard to which the Persian Government took so much exception, and if it was represented to the Persian Government that the guard would be removed.. no mention made of the sloop - and pointed out that provided agreement could be reached in other matters, we would be prepared to surrender any claims to Basidu. This would remo-’o all unpleasant ness and we could co-operate with the Persian Government m putting down slavery, etc., provided that the Persian Government assured us that no further incidents would take place. On these lines he felt that negotiations might he reGumed.. ihS dhAIRhAi'i maid that one great point m favour of the removal of the guard was that the ^hfn had given an assurance that an incident would not oocur again. old BOLTON LYRES MONSELL was of the opinion that would be tailing a great risk, and thought it would be bulficient to make an apol&lt; and remove the guard. iy ? start treaty negotiations ( LORD HAIL Oh AM then withdrew.) - 11 -SIB JOHN SIMON pointed out that Sir HegincOd Hoars had stated very clearly that, in his opinion, the removal of the armed guard was a jiae^uajtm to the re-opening of treaty negotiations, and in a later telegram had adaed that tne presence of the sloop might also preclude these negotiations being re-opened® Tm 0HAII?MAN sa:ld not feel quite happy about the complete withdrawal of the sloop 3 though it might be practicable to let it withdraw for a period and tnen return. if another flag incident did occur it would 5 in view of the Shah’s assurances, put him completely in the wrong. The withdrawal of the sloop and armed guard would not mean giving up the Easidu card, but would really only entail playing the hand in a different and a better way. olh JOHii SIMON asked w/hetrier the Secretary of State for India would agree to the action suggested, i*e. , the official withdrawal of the guard, but the sloop to remain, subject to any temporary withdrawal that might be agreed upon.J Mf, bAKKLY said that the action proposed would meet with the approval of the Secretary of State for India. MR. GRIEVE said that he could accept, without ^ese. v^t ion, on behalf of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, tne proposed action, though, in fact, the Chancellor,being 5 iiad - no 't had an opportunity of seeing the papers. - 12 -agreed:- 0 COHCLU; THE SUB-COMMITTEE (a) To recommend the immediate withdrawal of the armed guard at BasidUr, 'but not the withdrawal of the sloop; (h) That the First Lord of the Admiralty should consider the question of instructing the Commander-in-chief ? East Indies 3 to rnahe a temporary with drawal of the sloop 3 in order to ease the situation; (c) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the First Lord of the Admiralty should he ashed to draft a telegram on these lines to Sir Reginald Hoare at Tehran. SIR BOLTON EYRES MONSELL said that he felt that these conclusions would he trying the naval authorities on the spot very highly» THE CHAIRMAN suggested that it should he recoried that there was no intention to imply the least Plane on any of the naval officers who had been concerned in the incident. He suggested that a full explanation of the situation, as seen by His Majesty's Government, should he sent to the Commander-in-chief, in order that he might ho acquainted with the way in which it was intended to carry on negotiations. SIR JOHN SIMON agreed that it should he placed on record that the withdrawal of the armed guard implied no criticism of any of the leers been in any way connected with the incident. - t TerpT-rP observed that t.iere SIR PHILIP CUNLIi-PE-LIcimR OOS was one other question raised in the First Lord's memorandum, and that was the purchase of land in nahrein. * t a whether he wanted to proceed He asked the First Lord v/he the with this. -13-BKL SIR BOLTON EYRES MONSELL stated that the Admiralty desired to go on with this * as a form of insurance. LORD LONDONDERRY stated that the Air Ministry also desired to purchase land in Bahrein. If the admiralty were first in the marhet it would have the effect of sending up the price of the land. THE CHAIRMAN suggested that this was a matter which need not he considered hy the Sub committee ? and could he dealt with departmentally. MR. GRIEVE agreed and said that the question hsd already heen discussed departmentally* LORD LONDONDERRY said it would he necessary for the Admiralty and Air Ministry to work together to avoid competition. SIR BOLTON LYRES MONSELL said that in any event the Admiralty did not want to figure as the purcnasers of the land 5 as if the fact became known it might jeopardise their claims to remain at Henjam* x. V s X -14 ■■InA short discussion then took place as to the essential features of any treaty,, particularly in regard to Henjom^ which was entered into with Persia,, SIR BOLTON EYRES MONSELL said the Admiralty were particularly anxious to secure a Linding agreement and to ensure that vexatious restrictions would not he enforced hy the Persian Government 0 At the present time there were a number of such restrictions which did not facilitate the use of Hen jam as a Naval base and tended to cause friction between the Persian Government and naval authorities, SIR JOHN SIMON agreed that this point would require consideration^ and suggested that the whole question of the terms of the treaty would require to be considered when the situation as regards Basidu had been cleared up. CONCLUSION. THE SUB-COMMITTEE agreed :- to defer consideration of the essential features of a treaty with Persia until the situation as regards Basidu had been cleared up.

I am directed by the Secretary of state for India to saj tH it he hc*s had under his consideration the letter addressed by the Foreign Office to the Admiralty on S3rd November, No.E. 7004/1273/34, on the question of the course of action which should now be pursued with the Persian Government in the light of one opinion recently expressed by the Law Officers of the Crown in regard to the claims and rights of His Majesty’s Government at Basidu. 2« Since the receipt oi the letter in Question Sir Samuel Hoare has seen Tehran telegrams 326 and 327. He directs me in the first place to say that he is disposed to think that the general line sugg ested in paragraph 2 of Tehran telegram 327 (subject possibly to certain verbal modifications) might be adopted* if His Majesty’s Government consider that the communication recommended in the Foreign Office letter of ^3rd November should be accompanied by an oral statement designed to remove any misapprehensions which may be entertained by the Shah as to the Mudir incident. Oo Subject to the reservations indicated below* Sir Samuel Hoare is in general agreement with the instructions proposed in paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Foreign Office letter. But he is of opinion* in the first place* that however weak m fact the position of His Majesty’s Government might be in ihe British concession at Basidu it would be inadvisable to make the admission of weakness which would be constituted by formally intimating in writing, or even orally, to the Persian - 1 -Government coat His Majesty s Government were prepared, to agree in future to Persian customs officials using any part of Basidu and the waters adjacent to it for the control of suspected d-^o&lt;vs 9 and that Britisn naval officers would he so instructed. The Secretary of State would prefer to avoid any statement of this nature whieh 5 in his view*, could only tend to prejudice the position still further. In his view a hetter course would he, while making no formal admission of Persian rights in the concession area, to turn a hlind eye, when once the guard has been withdrawn and pending the outcome of any further negotiations, to the activities of Persian customs officials within the British concession in regard to such matters as the control of dhows. Secondly, it is in Sir Samuel Hoare’s opinion for consideration whether it would not he hetter to refrain from intimating in so many words to the Persian Government that the guard would he replaced if a further incident occurred. It might he preferable to proceed on the explicit under standing that we were withdrawing the guard in full confidence that the Persian Government were willing and able to ensure that there would he no repetition of the flag incident or similar occurrence. 4. a copy of this letter is being sent to the Colonial Office, Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry, Treasury and the Secretary of the Official Middle East Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence.

STANDING- MINISTERIAL SUB—COMl/IITTSE FDR 'U AST TONS CONCERNING THE MIDDLE EAST. A NGLO PERSIAN RET, AT IONS „ N AVAL STATION IN THE PERS I AN GULF . Mamorandum By the First Lord nf the Admiralt y... I nake no apology for bringing to the notice of my colleagues on the Middle East Sub-Committee, as a matter of urgency, the difficult situation which has arisen in Anglo- Persian relations, v/ith particular reference to the future site of our naval station in the Persian Gulf. This matter has recently been the subject of prolonged and anxious consideration in the Admiralty, and I have also had the advantage of disoussing it with the Civil Lord, wha has just returned from a tour of the Middle and Par East, during which he has had the opportunity of studying the problem in consultation with the Commander-in-Chief, East Incites Station, and the local Officers- I am impressed by the danger which undoubtedly exists that if the matter is allowed to d rift we may be left without a naval station in the Gulf - a situation which might well make it necessary to re-consxder our whole position and policy in the Middle Last. This question was recently considered by the Official Middle East Sub-Committee, vho were unable to agree on a satisfactory solution. The matter seems to me of suen 'importance that I am glad of the Opportunity thus afforded of discussing it with my colleagues. There are three places in the Persian Gulf vhich have been regarded as suitable sites for a naval station in the past. These are Basidu -nd Henjam, situated on— - 2 - Persian islands at the irouth of the G-ulf, and Bahnoin an island undar Arah nile and British protection # lying i^ff the Arabian Coast about half vnj up the Gulf„ Of these Basidu, which has been in British occupation for over a century ? has recently been the subject of a reference to the Law Officers of the Crown, who have advised in effect that there is insufficient evidence to establish a British title either by prescription or otherwise, although they point out that the question of a prescriptive title is not free from uncertainty, and that the arguments in favour of auch a title are sufficiently strong to 'strengthen the ha da of His Majesty 1 s Government in any negotiations they may think proper'. This,in ray ©pinion, makes it unnecessary to considor developing Basidu as a Naval Station; but does net preclude the use of Basidu as a bargaining factor. There remain, therefore, Henjam and Bahrein. The Naval Station is now, in fact, situated at Henjam, and one of the prime objectives of the long drawn out treaty negotiations has been to attempt to secure fcrsian recognition of our position there, which at the moment has no legal foundation. The Persian Government have shown little readiness so far to meet our wishes in this matter, and the question for decision, therefore, is whether to persist in our attempt tp persuade them to do so. I am strongly of opinion that we should maintain this attempt for the iollowing reasons (l) Henjam is by far the best site for a Naval Station, possessing as It does a good anchorage and a good position adjacent the Trucial Coast and commanding the mouth of the Gulf. Its climate also is generally less unpleasant than that of Bahrein; and all the facilities we3 - requiro are already available there. At Bahrein equivalent facilities vrould cosj? probably £400,000, although the place could be made suitable for use by Sloops at a cost of about £40,000® Assuming, therefore, that we cah induce the Persians to behave in a reasonable manner ana refrain from a policy of pin pricks in the future, the only important disadvantage of Henjam is that if Persia were neutral its use as a Naval Station in war might prove impossible; but in view of its advantages in peace, the Admiralty are prepared to accept this disadvantage and to rely f if necessary, on an improvised station near the mouth of the Gulf in war. In my view Persia gains more than does this country from the Treaty as new drafted. If Henjam is dropped out, ^ie would apparently receive the friendship of this country, the remission of her debts, a gift nf the Duzdap Railway and of 7//T Stations at Henjam, Bushire and Lingah, -n-' a recognition of her very doubtful claim to Sirri, in addition to the rendition of Basidu, in exchange for nothing more substantial than recognition of the independence of Bahrein and other Arab States and of our special treaty relations with the Arabs.. Such a treaty would be very one sided, so much so that I am of opinion that it would not be worth pursuing. I suggest, therefore, that a satisfactory arrangement for the continued use of Henjam by H.Mo Ships free from petty Persian restrictions should be made a sine c;ua non of the treaty negotiations.( 3 ) Our departure from Henjam, coupled with the rendition of Baaidu, would have a had effect upoa our influence in the Gulf, which hao already been seriously shaken 0 Once we leave the Persian shore we can never return. An agreement giving us the right to remain even for a short time, can he subsequently extended if the present regime is maintained; ana if the present regime comes to an end, and Persia dis integrates, we shall be left in in possession. As for Bahrein, I am informed that the probable development of the island as a result of the discovery of oil makes it desirable, if a Naval Station is ever likely to he required there, to buy the necessary land now, and in fact that if the matter is left much longer suitable land might prove unobtainable. In these circumstances, and in j view of the uncertainty of the future of Hen jam, I propose to seek authority t 6 purchase land now, purely as a matter of insurance. Part of the land required is, in fact, at present in the market, and the whole could be obtained for the estimated sum of £3,000. I would propose that for the time being no money at all should be spent on development. I do not anticipate that my colleagues v/ill differ from my view that Hen jam should continue to be our objective in negotiation with the Persian Government, but I hope further tnat they will concur in my opinion that wo should now endeavour to reach agreement with the least possible delay. I urge that the Treaty should be presented to the Persian Government as a whole, and that if they re-open details' oiscussicns over ground which has been examined time and time a gain, the Minister should ask for an audience with the Shah (who alone appears to have the necessary pov/er to negotiate) and him to understand that the British Government are notprepared to resume a long and abortive process of haggling with aibordinates; that they regard the Draft Treaty presented as a fair settlement; and that unless he ta prepared to accept the essential features of the Treaty they can see no useful purpose in proceeding with the matter. I would leave discretion to our representative at Tehran as to details, but in my view the essential feature of any Treaty is the wming assent of the Persians to our occupation of Henjam in return for the surrender of our rights at Basidu. It will be of course be necessary to secure a binding agreement *hich will remain in force for an agreed period and continue thereafter unless determined by cither side. I am informed that the Shah considers himself badly treatco. by otner i-owers and would welcome a Treaty of friendship v/itn Great Britain. ;e could offer to co-operate with him in tre suppression of slave and. arms traffic, and in the j| maintenance of peace in the Gulf, objects which are of as much value to him as to His Majesty’s Government. In return for that we should expect his loyal co-operation and the discontinuance of the incidents which have in the past one so much to disturb our good relations. Whether an effort to secure such an early decision would succeed or net, I do not khow, but I think the attempt is worth making. in the meanwhile I consider that no steps should be taken at Basidu which would lead the Persians to suppose that we are abandoning any of our claims at that place. ''e should, offer to withdraw the guard, our ships and. but only when agreement has been reached as to the Qssentials of the Treaty itself. The policy I suggest may therefore be anmmed up as follows (l) Resume Treaty negotiations forthwith, making the grant of facilities for .H.Sfrips at Hcnjam a sine qua non of the Treaty.Admiralty, S.I.l. •Sip 27th November, 1933 ; » You will remember that the official Middle East Committee were unable to reach agreement in regard to our policy in the Persian Gulf, The matter has been, and is, the subject of grave concern to the Foreign Office, India Office and the Admiralty, I think that the best course for us now to take is to refer the matter to the Ministerial Middle East Committee, and I enclose a memorandum which I have prepared as a basis for discussion which I hope may take place at a very early date.

I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to request you to inform the horde Commissioners of the Admiralty that the Persian chargd d'Affaires called at the Foreign Office on November 84th, and, under instructions from his Government, made representations similar to those made by the Persian Government on November 2Srd to Sir Reginald HQare* 2o Monsieur Noury explained that it was the earnest hope of the Persian Government that His Majesty 5 s Government would settle the questions arising out of the recent arrest of the Persian mudir of customs at Basidu in seme manner- which would give satisfaction to the Persian Government, as this would be infinitely preferable to the Persian Government finding themselves in the necessity of referring the matter to some third party. On being pi’essed to say exactly what he or his Government had in mind by this allusion to a third party. Monsieur Noury replied that he understood that what was contemplated was a reference either to the council of the League of Nations or to the permanent Court of international Justice at The Hague, 55, Secretary ^ Admiralty - piipl3o The lords Commissioners of the Admiralty will observe from these oammunicat ions that the possibility of Hieteajesty : 8 Government being taken before an international tribunal on the question of their rights at Basidu has now become an immediate one, and I am accordingly to express the hope that Their lordships may be able to furnish Sir John Simon with a very early reply to Foreign Office letter NO.

In reply t am directed to make the following observations. 2. Throughout your letter under reply, the implica tion is made that the Senior Naval Officer was at fault in that he did not sufficiently take into account the uncertainty of the British title to Basidu. In Their Lordships 1 view, no blame can be imputed to the Senior Haval Officer on this account for the following reasons. 3. The weakness of the British claim to Basidu has long been recognised by the British Government, as is evidenced by the C.T.D. 'Document P.0.13/28 mentioned in your letter, but on the other hand the consistent policy of H.M. Government vis-a-vis the Persian Government has been to make no admission of this weakness and to maintain [lader-Secretary of State, / ^ Foreign Office, S.W.l, • • e. _ force, the exclusion of Per&amp;iua official© jjecesa^A' ^ T'he orders which were issued la 19 £b to the - ga«i'i a * 1 al Officer to employ force, if necessary, in Lgtisg the arrest of the carettiker for a arauggliag never been rescinded. In Their Lordships* the position is ndsirably susamurisea in a Memorandum fl ,t e ^er XV31 which formed encloaure Ko.£ in goare's despatch So.578 of October 19ol. Extracts I this Kesoranduca containing procticuilp all its moot Ltaat passages were, la fact* appropriately append eel t v ; orders isrmed bp the Senior Savui officer for the ^a, (See encloeare Bo.l to this letter). 4, in Their Lordships 1 opinion, the difficulty that arisen over this incident springs primarily from a idmsontal conflict of views between the Foreign Office jifce one ^rd and those directly responsible for adsials- tion in the lersiun Gulf on the other. The fact Is t oar position in the Persian Gulf has been la certain F eta 8 one what weak from a legal point of view, so much at unless the situation la handled firmly and those [ 1 veak&amp;eaees disguised as much ns possible, British aeaee in the Gulf would be seriously undermined. This Baity in the case of Bus id u ia reeogaiaed la the / Memorandum ♦ * # *2 . gemoranta® (prepared at Teheran) mentioned in the preceding paragraph, for example, in paragraph 4, where it is stated that ,f ao long ao we can hy bluff maintain our imaginary right to the enclave, we can claim territorial waters”. (Note - this phrase does not appear in the extracts appended to the written orders for the guard), fhe cabinet have repeatedly reaffirmed the necessity for a firm handling of the situation, as witness for example Cabinet 58(32) conclusion 4, in which, notwithstanding that we had no title to Henjam, the Cabinet agreed 'that we should adopt a firm line of policy towards Persia and should not evacuate Henjam or surrender our position in any way with seeming acQuiescence”. On the other hand the foreign Office have always been extremely reluctant to take up any position or to maintain any rights which could not be fully substantiated from the narrow legal point of view - a policy which is aptly illustrated by the suggestion that the Senior Naval Officer should not have taken firm action at Basidu, because of the doubt as to our ultimate legal position there. 5. In Their Lordships’ view, the possibility of / the ..3. tue incident was inherent in the policy which has in fact teen consistently maintained at B&amp;sidu until the present time. ^ ia dan 8 er ^ aa greatly increased by the fact that from a date in 1930 the guard which for two years previously had maintained continuously at Basidu was removed, and until recently was only reinstated for short intervals, thus leaving the British flag flying unguarded. The decision to remove the guard, for ishieh Their Lordships must accept their full share of responsibility, must be regarded as one of the prime causes of the Persian encroachments leading to the incidents which have recently occurred at Basidu. 6. Their Lordships are entirely unable to concur with the view that it was the duty of the Senior Saval Officer to seek the concurrence of H.M. Minister at Teheran in the orders issued by him. The Political Resident has always been regarded as the officer responsible for political relationships within the Gulf area, and the standing Instructions for the Commander-in-Chief, nast Indies, recognise this fact (see extracts forming enclosure 2 to this letter). Their Lordships are of opinion that in a matter of this kind the responsibility of the Senior Naval Officer is completely discharged when he has consulted the j political .. • •.5. immediately reported and it would have been open to H.M. (jovernoient to issue instructions for the Mudir to be ejected over the boundary into Persian Basidu without further ado. Orders were, however, issued by the Admiralty as the result 0 f a conference at the Foreign Office, and with the full concurrence of the Foreign Office and India office, to convey [[|/v the Mudir forcibly in one of H.M. Ships to Bandar Abbas. It was this action which, in 0?heir Lordships’ view, raised the matter into the stature of an internat ional incident, fhis opinion is borne out by the conversations with the Persian Prime Minister and other officials reported in paragraph 4 in Mr. Mallett’s telegram Ho.310 which the Charge d^Affaires summarises as follows;* ’’If you had merely put the Mudir over the boundary nobody would have minded, but you were wrong in carrying him off to Bandar Abbas”. 9. In view of the foregoing considerations Their Lordships are completely unable to agree that any blame rests upon the Senior B&amp;val Officer in this matter. They strongly deprecate any attempt to lay blame on officers on the spot (unless indeed orders have been disregarded, which cannot for one moment be alleged in this instance) when these officers are endeavouring to the best of their j ability ••■•#q :, * V . 6 “' 6 . ability to uphold the British position ana prestige in a c onfu sed situation - the result of a policy none of their own making • 10* With regard to the question of the amendments of the orders to the Guard at Baaidu now in force, in fheir Lordships’ view the recent Law Officers’ opinion hare made it necessary to review carefully the whole question of our position vis-a-vis the Persians at that place. AQ such a review must of necessity be undertaken in the very insaediate future, Their Lordships do not propose in the meantime to issue instructions for any further alterations to be made in the orders.

An 'amicable settlement' was reached without formal discuss ion of the general issues involved.' It seems therefore that both these attempts at enforcement of reraia’s rights failed* and that the at At as qm in definitely that within the ^concession' neither fere im customa off lei ale nor Persian officers of the law have any authority. This is borne out by the somewhat apologetic attitude adopted toy Teymourtaehe in regard to the 19£8 incident* In conversation with Sir B. Olive he ma In t a in- ed that he personally had always loyally maintained the status quo in the Gulf and that the incident occurred while he was absent in Europe. In conversat ion, there fore, he admitted that the incident was a breaeh of the status quo,' as regards territorial waters the enclave has a sea frontage, and therefor© if it belonged to ub really, it would carry with it a small stretch of territorial waters. tt will be seen thff*t the Customs Director definitely olalms Jurisdiction over British Baeidu, and that hia act iv it lea and those of other local officials have been increasing of late, doubt less as a result of the withdrawal of the guard.

As I understand the position the Mudir is quite within his rights to order that all stores lauded which are intended for Persian Basidu should he dealt with through the Customs there in order to prevent smuggling from British Basidu. If on the other hand tie interferes with vessels landing goods legitimately intended for British Basidu the question has aspects which should be dealt with. Can you say whether there has been any interference in this respect, or whether the Mudir is merely issuing his orders so that smuggling through British Basidu can be prevented. (1005). FROM 'LUPIN'.

On 2lst June British Agent was warned berbaliy by me against allowing stores to be landed in British Basidu and smuggling into Persia. x t is submitted if Mudir suspects this to he taking place complaints should be forwarded through the proper channels and be would not be justified in interfering with dhows in British waters. It is presumed that at any rate some stores are required for British Basidu and if head man's report is correct it appears Mudir has interfered with the landing of these. As thowever reliability of Headman’s information doubtful and all dhow owners are at present away in their dhows, it is suggested inat further investigations be postponed until return ot British Agent.rv, The Senior Naval Of fleer, Persian Gnlf Division, frm H.M.B.-Triad H at Basra.

DA3IDU - SPUGrGLIHa . With reference to -Lupin 1 s tt message dated 5th September, timed 1945, and subsequent messages on the Question of the Mudir of Customs* orders at Basidu, briefly the position is as follows. 2 In the past there have been well-founded comj laints of smuggling' from British Basidp into Persian territory and the late caretaker was under strong suspicion of oeing implicated. This caretaker was dismissed and the present caretaker, Shaikh Moni Ausati was appointed in his place. Since his arrival there have been no com plaints as to smuggling, but it is important that the Persians should be given no grounds for complaint now or in the future. The Mudir of Customs in Persian Basidu is quite entitled to a±K give what orders he likes to dhows which land goods intended for Persian territory, but if vessels come to British Basidu to land ^oods for that place, and the authorities in Persian territory take any measures to prevent them doing_ so, then a situation is created which must be dealt with through the proper channels. 3, It is of course imperative that any protest, ipade to the Persian Government should be supported by the clearest evidence that there has been unwarranted inter ference with the right of dhows to land goods at British Basidu. 4. During your noxt visit to fasidu you are requested to make careful enquiries, to obtain if ^ ° ? y of the Mudir*s orders and to send me a detailed repo on the matter. Any complaint of the headman or care-. taker which cannot be supported by £aG ' ts both of them may quite well be unable to engage in profitable smuggling ventures, and may for that reason be anxious to show up the xersian officials in an unfavourable light. (Sgd.) L.S.Crabbe, Cap tain, Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf.aiscussea this morning with sir F. Stewart. He thought it preferable not to commit ourselves on the question of status so far as we should if we were to admit to the Persians, even orally, that we should in future recognise their rigirtfto exercise customs, etc. k , jurisdiction in British Basidu. The best course seemed ^ to be to say nothing to them on this point; to withdraw the guard (a very substantial concession); and to turn a blind eye to the activities of customs officials until the position in regard to negotiations with Persia was clearer. Since the discussion Tehran telegram 327 has been received.

It was agreed that the Foreign Office should j officially approach the Admiralty on these lines. foreign Oifice have now done so in the j letter of 23rd November, on P.z.7625/33 below, which is under consideration at the Admiralty* henael rang up this morning to say that from secret information just received by the Foreign Office there seemed some reason to think that the Persians might be moving more quickly than we oUspected and that we might well find ourselves faced with a suggestion that our action in removing the we Mudir should he taken to arbitration unless/were able to take immediate action at Tehran on the lines suggested in the letter of 23rd November. He was to see the Persian Charge d'Affaires this afternoon and might have a clearer idea of the Persian attituae after his interview. In the meantime, he earnestly 2119 5000 8.33 pressed/ I2 pressed that if the Secretary of State was disposed to agree with the general line taken in that letter the India Office should at once indicate this, without waiting for Admiralty comments. I said I would submit this for consideration. 4. Mr. Walton and I, after considering the Foreign Office letter, think that the course therein suggested is probably on the whole the best, with the modification, however, gthat it might be preferable to make the communication in regard to the visiting of Persian vessels in the waters of Basidu or the use of Basidu for the control of suspected dhows orally rather than in writing. The position of H.L.G.in the matter is not very comfortable and there is, we think, force in Mr. Rendel's suggestion that the ■sooner we authorise Sir R.

Mr. Mallet have been sound throughout. Shah is utterly reluctant to break with us and this reluct ance will merely increase his rage if consideration of prestige determines him to do so. 2. Having read the whole file I cannot see why His Majesty’s Government should hesitate to say that instructions for dealing with Mudir obviously had to be issued without delay on telegraphic reports, and having now examined issue in the light of detailed reports they realise that their sole purpose, which was to maintain interpretation of status quo, would have been equally well attained had they simply sent Mudir back to his post and protested against, repeated trespass, and that it was entirely alien to poll y and traditions of His Majesty's Government to humiliate V _ „ 4 - nn to SSlV that sue CSSS fill friendly nation* If message ven conclusion of treaty negotiations would settle status of Basidu in Persia's favour, and especially if guanas simultaneously withdrawn, I am almost certain Shah would drive his Government headlong into a general settlement. anyhow I see nothing to looe b„ t. y'2. (3) Alternative seems to 1)6, as Mr, Mallet has pointed out, to risk all the evils resultant from driving the Shah | Pinto a rage in which he issues wild orders which his Ministers neither dare nor are physically in a position to withdraw. In oil dispute we More this factor in mind with the happiest results. (4) The fact that the country is absolutely dominated by one man who in some circumstances rages like a lunatic is of course a great pity but it is a fact. it is also a fact that his general policy, as he claims, suits His Majesty T s Government well, even though it makes control of Arab sheikhs less easy. Living as we do here, in close proximity to hV^. trembling instruments, we may slightly exaggerate the cyclonic nature of his passion* In fact it may conceivably contain an. element of bluff. Hut I am far from sure of this and I should be most reluctant to advocate that His Majesty’s Govern ment act on any such belief. If we ( group undec: ) for a subservient vassal it would be another matter and present would !e excellent opportunity of asserting our strength and of breaking the Shah if he failed to bend. Having no such in convenient ambition I cannot believe that we have anything to Igain from gambling on the possibility that Shah’s rage is bluff and therefore refusing to be concilitary when he has I some excuse for believing that intentionally or not we have damaged his prestige.

Unless some radical alteration in the political situation as between His Majesty's Govern- mnt and the Persian Government can he brought about in the near future, it will be necess? ry for His igjesty*s Govenment to make some reply to this challenge, sere they to leave it unanswered, other wise than by agreement with the Persian Gove ram at, the Persian Government would assuredly not be content to 1st the matter rest. The fact that His Majesty's Government were unwilling or unable to produce a clear or even plausible statement of the legal grounds on which they base their claim, would merely encourage the ersi&amp;n Government to pursue the matter by following up the hint which they have already given that, unless n satisfactory settlement can be reached, they will feel bound to taka the matter to arbitration. It will be remembered that in the case of the nglo- ersian Cii dispute. His Majesty's Government were able, owing to the strength of their legal position, to taka the Persian Government immediately to the Council ot the League of nations, and that, as &amp; result of this a settlement of the dispute satisfactory to His Majesty's Government and to the Anglo- r ersiari Oil Company was reached. In the present case, the situation is reversed. Tie legal position of His Majesty s Govern ment is - in the opinion of their own Law Officers so weak as to be untenable if the matter were referred to any impartial tribunal, and the Persian Government, unless5 unless general Anglo-Persian political relations can be materially improved, can be relied anon to take full advantage of this fact* 4. The Lords OonalsB.loners will be the first to appreciate the deplorable consequences which would result If matters were to be allowed to develop on these lines* It is clear from the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown that, in the ©vent of arbitral proceedings or of a reference of any dispute arising out of the position of His Majesty's Government at Bssidu to the Council of the League, His Majesty’s Government would be unable to establish their case* An arbitral judgment or a League decision in favour of Persia would be a foregone conclusion, and such a judgment or decision might be accompanied by a demand, not only for the immediate evacuation of Basidu by Bis .Majesty's Government but also for the payment to Persia of compensation for any wrong which she might be represented as having suffered as a result of the continued use of the area by British forces* 5. Apart fro© these direct results, were the situation allowed to develop on these lines, relations between His Majesty's Government and the Persian Government would inevitably become such as to render the continued use by Hit Majesty's ships of the neighbouring naval station at Henjam (where It is admitted that His Majesty's Government possess no legal rights of any value whatever) impracticable* The4. The fact that matters were allowed to reach a point where the Persian Government could successfully take His Majesty’s Government to arbitration over their claims at Br&gt; sidu, would a_fortiori involve so serious a deterioration in Anglo-Persian relations as to render inevitable a reiteration of the Persian Govern ment’s demand, of September 1932 for the evacuation of Hen jam by His Majesty’s naval forces. It will be remembered that that demand» which His Majesty's Govsnment cannot legally resist, has only been suspended during the continuance of negotiations for b general settlement, as has been repeatedly pointed out by His Majesty’s Representative in Persia, if negotiations for a general settlement arc broken off, the demand for evacuation of Henjsm will automatically be revived. It is obvious that if the present dispute with the Persian Government becomes so acute as to involve reference to the Council of the League, a continuance of negotiations for a. general settle ment will be out of the question. Unless therefore some means can be found of securing such an improvement In the political atmosphere at Tehran, and more especially in the personal attitude of the hah, as to make it possible to agree with the Persian Govera- Bient that the question of the precise nature of the rights claimed by His majesty’s Government at Basidu shall, for the present, be allowed to drop, His Majesty’s Government will be faced with the certain loss in the near future not only of Basidu, but also °f Henjam. 86* As Their Lordships arsswrs txxm the toiegraphio oorrespoadenoe with -.is ajes%V» •Jhari.io dh'iffaires at Tehran* of whioh oopios have been sent to the /uMmity* both the Lush persoii&amp;Xl,^ * and also his Goverrisasnt are still greatly incensed against His Majesty*s Ooveimant as a result of the arras t of the Mudlr a*. . ^sidu* and oan be no question of a re-establishment of mors satisfactory political relations until Persian irritation at this incident can in some way be alloyad# 7* ..sir John Liman m.n now omsidered, in consultation with His Majesty 1 s Charge A # iCIUfM at Tehran, the piet J whether it is in fact possible to give to the shah and the Persian Gove ment in ocmxmion with the ineiu-m of the arrest of the • uau w satinfaciioai mdle avoiding W direct admission Vy Ids jesteroovextaaest of a previous error, would be sufficient to induce them to regard the Incident as od and to refrain from pressing farther in u...v&amp;rr - of a general setUoiissat, thair challenge to the rights olainei by Ills Majesty's Cioveiment at Basidu# thus mderiJig possible u resumption of ne^otiatioiii for a general treaty s^l -4e •&lt;.-nt vith a rcusoaahl© hope of success* 8, Qm of the points which has mused the strongest feelings in Tehran in tliis matter has been the estabHabasmt of the permanent idtish gujird* Xthough it is m doubt true that in the last few years British pards have been posted at B&amp;sldu from time to time, an appeal to the some- wague and mm Actory status quo under® I 4 1® ^likely to convince the Persian Government that the recent SBkblishaeat of this guard, coupled with the increased v -4dlance of the British naval authorities mii the seizure °f the PiUdir, followed by the ,waen t hmpectl ui of ^.sidn V the Owinnle|i i| a 1 fjlftlif| does not indicate a tendency on them part of His Majesty*« (tover.-Haant to exploit and develop their oietiis* Bftsidu in a a»w and more aotiv-e wmiwr* inffreaaiag w-vvou'dimm m this saore, and ■ .r» LnlUt hm L;,r' Ai ^ ,.. t . i,, ■. &gt;; , ■ • , aiid th« Persian Ooveiment mm- recently ,^an inclia^l to dmbt whether '.is jesty*s iiQmrmmt mix not eoate^^iating a reversai of their preri rer to hand aver to Persia. as part of a treaty settlement, such rights as they say have ixjssessed at aasidue \’m .&gt;eoretary of htate considers it essential# if a »n 4 satisfactory at»ospl]t&lt;i e is to h', ro-e^tahlisried at Tehran, t4mt tiiesf thaui&gt;: be allayed; end, in his opinion the h^st «* if not the only hope of indnoiac the Versiaa \mmX to regard the incident -of the -.rrrst of the y.ud.lr as oXcused to refrain fim.. preying their challenge of the.

It Is in fact no longer possible to maintain m attitude based on a bluff which has already been called. At the same time, fir John Simon appreciates the objections to making any open admission to the 'Persian Government that the action of British naval authorities in arresting the Mudlr was definitely illegal. But if the guard is now withdrawn from Basidu, as suggested above, It would be possible to explain to the Persian Government that, as His Majesty’s Government will no longer be in a position themselves to control shipping anchoring and sheltering iaaediately off the area, in view of the removal of the guard, they will raise no further objection to Persian officials viol ting Persian vessels in these waters, and using any part of Basidu for the control of suspected dhows. 10. If the above views meet with the concurrence of l ' ie Lords Commissioners, the Secretary of State would Propose to instruct His Majesty’s minister at Tehran to addings to the Persian Government a written communication * n the following sense:- 11 .8 . Xi, His Majesty's Government have had under consideration in consultation % ! ith His Majesty's Minister the best means of ending the recriminations which have followed upon the recent unfortunate incidents at Basldu. They feel that the surest way to put an end to ail incidents in the Persist Gulf will be the conclusion of a general treaty, They wish once more to make it clear that the question of Basidu will be one of the matters to be dealt with in the treaty, and that, if a satisfactory settlement is reached upon all other points, they will be prepared to surrender their rights in Basldu* In the meanwhile, relying upon the assurances contained in the Persian Government's note of September Ifth last (see Tehran telegram Mo. 199 of September 13th enclosed in Foreign Office letter No. K 5402/ 1875/84 of September 14th), : ls Majesty's Government have decided to withdraw the armed guard no® maintained at Basidu, an they do not intend to re-establish it unless they are forced to do so by some fresh insult to the British flag there. They realise, however, that the removal of th 5 guard might possibly open the door to smuggling, and are anxious to assure the ersi&amp;n Government that they have ao wish to shelter contraband trade. They are accordingly prepared in future to agree to ersian customs officials using any part of Basidu and the waters adjacent to it for the control of suspected dhows, and instructions *ili be given to the British naval authorities in this souse. 1&amp;. Sir John imoa appreciates that such a coiEmuaication would represent a recession from the position recently taken up in regard to British rights at Basidu. he ig convinced that any lesser gesture on the part oi Majesty's Government could not give a. reasonable hope 0x success on the lines advocated above* Thlle failing the8, the adoption of such a course the only alternative appears to be that described in oara^raphs 4 and 5 above, namely 'h&amp;t His Majesty’s Government my find themselves compelled Mr®. k \ ^' to evacuate both Basidu a nr tenjam uiider pi assure, with such damage to their prestige in the . ersian Gulf as would. in Sir John Simon’s opinion, be infinitely greater than that which would accompany a voluntary withdrawal and the ultimate evacuation of Basiciu by agreement as now suggested* Moreover in lir John idmon’s considered opinion action on these lines offers the only hope of establishing at Tehran b sufficiently favourable atmosphere to enable negotiation© to be resumed with any hope of success; and, in view of the experience of the past few months, he is more than ever convinced that it is only by the negotiation of a satisfactory and friendly settlement with ersia that the position and prestige of 'is Majesty's Government in the Persian Gulf can in future be maintained* 13* Sir . Hoar© has arrived at Tehran on his return from leave, and the Secretary of state considers it important to furnish him with instructions on the present question with the least possible delay. 1 am therefore to request that a very early reply may be returned to the present letter, copies of which are being sent to the other ‘/.'apartment® of His Majesty's Government concerned. I am, i- i i t four obedient Servant (GJd,) Q, Vrf. KEsTDUZ lu , Ur^ ' r ' 9-^ S 2-&lt;/ j/I. IVaWTon, i—'*,. „ Ibder Secretary of State, Sm- ripz. 2- n 7 ^ —“V f” f'’ _» / J J ! 1 a 1 wv&gt; 19 b J \\ iUi informal discussion took place last night at the Foreign Oilice to consider the situation created by the opinion recently expressed by the Law Officers on the rights of in Basidu. 2 . ihe foreign Office in the first place emphasised that in the light of the opinion in question our position was exceedingly weak; that it was very desirable, having regard to this, and also on general grounds, to reach an early and amicable settlement ojfr the Mudir incident with the Persians, and to avoid the Persians pressing their challenge to us on the question of status. If it were possible to persuade them to drop this claim and to agree that the status of Basidu the like/various other matters in dispute between us, should be left for settlement in any general Treaty negotiations that would In their view be the best course. In the light of the maw Officers' opinion we might, if we were taken to arbitration on the question of status, suffer a rather humiliating reverse and from the point of view of our prestige in the Gulf the effects of being forced to evacuate Basidu under the finding of an arbitrator might be far from fortunate. They felt at the same time in the light of the reports which have been received from Tehran that,even allowing for a certain cooling down on the part of the Shah, it was most desirable to offer t-^e Persians (though Mr. Mallet had discouraged them % from entertaining any hopes) some small sop •VK C\ After a considerable discussion it appeared that the only sops which could be offered were either (a) a concession such as the recognition of the Persian right to inspect dhows in the territorial waters of/2 of British Basidu or to levy customs dues in the Concession, to either of which there was the objection that the Persians might take the line that we were offering to give them something to which they were in fact entitled (and to which unfortunately we now knew that they were entitled); and (b) some slightly more spectacular concession, such as an intimation that now that peace had been restored at Basidu, and as an emphasis of our confiaence that the Persians on their side as well as we on ours would take steps to secure that no further incidents occurred, we should be prepared to withdraw our guard, on the understanding, however, that if by any chance there was another flag incident or the like we should have to restore it. 4. The Admiralty anticipated considerable difficulty in securing the consent of their naval authorities to the withdrawal of the guard and intimated that those authorities were still of opinion that we ought to continue to bluff at Basidu. The Foreign Office thought it most difficult and e ven dangerous to persist in a policy of bluff now that we knew that our ground was so weak and now that the Persians had actually threatened us with reference to arbitration. I said that speaking personally I thought there was force in the ForeignOffice argument and that despite the objections to withdrawal of ^ke guard something on the lines of course (b) above seemed the best we could do in all the circumstances. We had in the past, before the Mudir incident arose, been inclined to think that once a satisfactory Persian reply was received as regards the flag incident it would have keen possible, after say two or three weeks 1 interval, to/3 r r jlrt'J e. , /Ka ^7 ‘ r ’ M - 1 to with.draw the guard quietly; ana if the liquidation of the present inciaent and the improvement of the atmosphere could he achieved by our now agreeing to withdraw it on the understanding stated, it might be the best course, it was finally agreed that the Foreign Office should at once write officially to the Admiralty recommending the withdrawal of the guard. 5. Some further discussion took place on the question whether Basidu should or should no-t'te surrendered to Persia ,in view of the Law Officers' opinion. The |- T - Admiralty stated that the Board had not yet reached a final decision, hut hinted that they would almost certainly he prepared to abandon Basidu, to he content with a 'gentlemen*s agreement' at Henjam, and prohahly to purchase an insurance area at Bahrein. I said that I thought we should he prepared, in that event, not to press the recomnendation put forward hy Colonel Fowle and Mr.Metcalfe, to which we haa given a general support in the Middle East Committee, that Henjam should he abandoned as well as Basiau, and that we should move the naval station to Bahrein; hut that we should regard it as of great importance that an insurance area should he acquired at Bahrein^ even l&lt;* £ * ^ Krf if we were to endeavour to remain at Henjam under a 'gentlemen's agreement'. Any area purchased at Bahrein need not he developed unless and until necessity for this ^rose. it should he bought in the name of the Air Ministry, and it was clear from the representations which had been received from the Political Hesident that sufficient to meet our needs could at the moment he purchased for a very reasonable price (about £1,500); that even as a commercial Proposition the purchase appeared to he a very sound investment and that, apart from this,purchase now would strengthen/4 strengthen our position against the Bahrein Petroleum Company in the event of their claiming later an interest in the area in question under the terms of their concession The Foreign Office said that they also, felt that an insurance area should he purchased in Bahrein. 6 . Foreign Office stated that Sir R. Hoare reached ienran yesterday. Once agreement had 'been reached between the interested Departments as to themnaling of Basidu in any Treaty negotiations, and Sir R. Hoare’s appreciation of the position and his recommendations as to the line to he adopted in connection with the negotiations had been received, the general position could he considered further, prohahly in the Middle East Committee. u tf-W£—’ 18/11/33./ GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.

' Vi fl u (o My dear Gilbert, I enclose an extract; from the private telegram from Mallet, which I mentioned in the course of our meeting on the evening of October 27th, about the incident ot the Mudir at Basidu* Y/q have not yet 'been able to trace the Bushire despatch referred to, 'but it is obviously only of minor importance. 2* The point made in this telegram seems to me most important. As you know, the whole case which we have made with the Persians in justification of our action in arresting the Mudir is based on the contention that his action in visiting a Persian dhow off the British area in Basidu was in fact a modification of ’ the status quo - i.e. a new departure. But if Persian customs launches were in fact regularly visiting or searching dhows off the British area at Basidu as recently as last May, it seems to me that the whole of this argument J, G. Laithwaite, Esq. COPY SENT BY AIR MAUL of j M3 77 COPY SENT TOargument al^out the new departure must fall to the ground. It? therefore, the Persians decide to take us to arbitration or to the League over the Mudir incident, it may he very material to know precisely what had been occurring previously as regards the visiting of dhows in Basidu waters, and I should be very glad to have any information which may have come your v/ay on this x^oint* I am sending a similar letter to Moore. 3 .COPY 6465/6069/84) j* - , ^ extract from private telegram from Mr* Mallet to Mr* Rendel dated 26th October 1933. 1 As a matter of fact this is not quite first time a dhow has 'been inspected off British area as gun boat informed us privately in May that according to caretaker ’’Persian Customs launches were still searching dhows anchored off British Basidu”. Customs officials have moreover certainly watched these dhows from point in British area (see e«g. Bushire despatch No. 952 B. December 23rd 1932 to Government of India). I fancy dhows have always used British Basidu because of water supply* Crabbe issued very stringent instructions against smuggling but I dare say caretaker connives at it when no naval parties are there#The proposal seems to me a little dangerous. Verbally it might seem to leave the Resident’s position unaffected for it would still remain for him to air his views to the Minister and S.N.O. as before. In reality ana as an almost inevitable consequence there might ensue a gradual dilution of the Resident’s responsibility (subordinate of course as far as Persia is concerned to the Minister) for political action* in one Gulf. It is through the Resident that the S.N.O. draws his political author!ty^and even as it is there ■ is always a tendency for overzeal on his part coupled of course, with his subordination to the ^jidniiruA and through him access to the Admiralty / to make him a little forgetful of the fact. I am clear that the proposal is administratively unsound and could only be made innocuous by considerable reservation on our part. Since dictating this I hear that the Admiralty also see objections to the proposal and that an anodine ty compromise is suggested.peS' jjinute Paper. Undersecretary /{. n. Secretary of State.

The main f-i-io ia undor-submir&amp;ctQ^ It has now been decided that the visits of the Naval Commander-in-Chief to Ahadan and Henjam shall he abandoned, further examination of the position between the Foreign Office and Admiralty having shown that they could not reasonably be regarded as covered by the status quo arrangement (see telegramson P.Z.7184/33). \ 2. Mr. toilet's telegram of 5th November rz,?2tf(n. No.305, now attached, gives the Persian reply to our latest Note of explanation on this subject. It will be observed that the Persians hint that 'reference of this question to an international assembly or impartial judge would result in a verdict in/a in favour of Persia'. The suggestion is no doubt largely bluff, but the possibility that the Persians might wish to take the matter further cannot altogether be ruled out, Mr. Mallet's comment is contained in his telegram No. 306, which is self-explanatory. It seems quite clear that pending receipt of the Law Officers* opinion on the status of Basidu and subsequent consideration in the Cabinet, if that should be necessary, of the question whether or not Basidu is to be surrendered to Persia in return for a satisfactory treaty settlement, the course tv ‘ i ° suggested in paragraph 7 of his telegram is the only one possible.^ ^^71 3. The Foreign Office are compiling a historical note showing the sequence of events in Basidu since January 1928 so as to l farcfr c+ U Ok. rCuZyfr j &lt;Ma —ifci be prepared in case we should be faced by'ahy— sudden suggestion by Persia that the dispute between us should be settled by reference to a third party. S-U-T* . Since the minute above was written the Law Officgrs have ruled decisively against our title to Basidu or the exercise of rights by us in it or in its territorial waters. Their opinion is being submitted separately. The fact that we are on such □ ad legal ground makes it additionally desirable to liquidate this incident as soon as possible. 17 2 /Department. ^ F-t.fcl ■ || fitsV. jj f* ^ rtM'l 2* No answer has yet been sent to Mr. Mallet's telegrams Nos. 305 and 306 of the 5th November; but on 7th November the Foreign Office, in their telegram 208, in i eply to an earlier telegram from, him, gave him a general line in reply to which he sent the interesting ^telegram of 8th November No.510. Mr.Mallet strongly urges the desirability of throwing some small sop to the Persian Government for the Munir incident and emphasises that feeling still runs high regarding it and that the risk of a Persian appeal to an international tribunal cannot altogether be ruled out. On the following day he telegraphed that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had intimated that the visits of H.M.3. HAWKINS to Abadan and Hen jam would after all oe permitted. 'This is meant as an olive branch, but | it was explained to me that the Persian Government still earnestly hopes for some satisfaction over Mudir incident. I carefully avoided holding out any hope'. 3. The Foreign Office, in their letter of 8th November on P.Z.7235, have informed the Admiralty of . their inability to accept the Admiralty view as to the propriety of the action taken by the Senior Naval Officer. We are not directly concerned with this aspect of the matter. But the Foreign Office are also I anxious to ensure that in future responsibility shall be specifically placed on the s.N.O. for requesting the Political Resident to forward to the Minister at Tehran any letter or report which he may address to the Resident, as the Chief political Representative of H.M.G. in the Gulf.

Before fudir's arrest I have no doubt Persian Government would have expected this, uo^ it is doubtful whether 3hah in his present temper would agree to negotiate before he has obtained some form of satisfaction for the sting of Jfudir’s arrest. On the other hand I have hinted to Minister for foreign ’Affairs (see paragraph to. 3 of my telegram No. 299) that after what has passed we ourselves might be reluctant to negotiate* 2, If a further excuse for delay is needed it might be possible for Sir H.Koare to take the lino that he must first see the Shahn But the Shah is due to leave about November 20th for three weeks to Mazanderan so audience could hardljf take place before December 10 th* 3* Such discussions as I have recently had had keen almost entirely directed towards preventing further isolation while trying to make Persians realise why 17,0 aero annoyed and how badly they have behaved tj 6 flr*v ^ o /vv (see paragraph 2 your telegram No. 205)* I have had..

Prime Mnister, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Director of Commerce all said 'If you had merely put Mudir over the boundary nobody would have minded much but you were wrong in carrying him off to Bunder Abbas'. They are really hurt and shocked at our action and inclined to accuse me of trying to apply to modern Persia the ideas of the 'bad old days' (?when J.) was here before. One official said to me 'it was the sort of thing we might have expected from Czarist Russia', I fear that no amount of arguing about status quo will convince them that we have a good case, 5 C They all said quite frankly that the Shah expects some gesture of regret dn our part just as he made a gesture about flag incident. Prime Minister said 'just a little gesture would put things right' (grp* undec.) I held out no hopes of it remarking that such gestures were difficult to make. He went on to speak in a sad and friendly way of his earnest desire for friendship, Me could he said in effect be allies even without any formal treaty of alliance, nis meanixig was developed later to me (grp. undec.) head of English Section in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who argued that Persians whole policy would operate to oiu advantage as it aimed solely at creating a nation strong,..&gt;T ft ■s of ths strong enough to escape from the toil?

Head of the English Section told me that Persian Government would dislike having to resort to such public washing of linen but would not hesitate in the last re sort« 1 rather think he was speaking the truth as Persians are genuinely convinced we have behaved badly ever Hadir and will never admit that l.iudir himself was to blame. 3^ It is admitted generally that tension is less than a week ago and possibly Shah may cool down before his return from Hazanderan though it would be unsafe (grp* undeco) on this.

Minister for Foreign Affairs then states that he will discuss at later date the principle of status quo but must emphasise that no judicial rights have ever belonged to His Majesty’s Government in any part of Basidu and that 'Persian officials have always carried out their duties there.' A phrase in my note that 'Mudir had insisted on endeavouring to exercise his functions in British Basidu' is quoted as evidence. Assertion is also made that Persian taxes have always been levied in all parts oi Minister for Foreign Affairs then argues that e ven if status quo must be observed it cannot be used to f si end every unusual act committed by British ofiicials and ^hat all claims must be based on documents, no reply has2 . ever teen given to numerous Persian requests (the last on gay 3lst 1926) for information about the document on which His Majesty's Government claim their rights to Basidu. x 4. Conduct of naval authorities was contrary to international principle and friendship and 'irreconcilable with any definite arrangements'. Even if His Majesty's Government had claim in respect of the use of Basidu such steps should not have been taken against Mudir by British navy. 5. Minister for Foreign Affairs continues that the Persian Government and public opinion consider this conduct as derogatory to their sovereign rights and prestige and cannot 'bearing in mind existing good relations between the two States imagine any reason for this procedure'. They are convinced that reference of this question to an inter** national assembly or impartial judge would result in verdict in favour of Persia« 6 0 Note concludes by repeating protest against the phrase 'British area' and request for reparation and for punishment of officers concerned.

TJ«DIATE. / Your telegrams i\o . 502 (ol October 31st) and No. 303 (oi -.cvemocr ord - Proposed, visits of Commciider-in-C’iief to Ahadan and Hen jam). On further consiaeration position appears to us to he as follows. Wnile Persians could not object to Hawkins mooring or anchoring in Shatt-el-Arab off Abadan and oilin in Iraqi waters, actual visit to Abadan involving lending on Persian soil, courtesy visits etc. would fall in practice into the sane category as visit to any other Persian port such as Bushire, end would be open to same objections. 2. It is true that His Majesty’s ships normally stationed in the Gulf, of which a list is periodically communicated to the Persian Government, do in fact when they oil at Abadan moor alongside, thus touching Persic?n soil. But this practice is covered by general arrange ments regarding visits to Persian ports, and not by any special arrangement which could be invoked as applying io Abadan only. Persians would therefore be within their rights in refusing to allow 'Hawkins' to tie up at Abadan and witholding all facilities for landing there or visits of members of British colony to the ship. It therefore be preferable to avoid visit to Abadan together. As regards Hen jam appeal to status qu.o _ might be more • * io &amp; • more justiiiable, since although it is technically a Persian poib ano. theieiore legs.lly covened.

It has since been decided, in the light of Colonel Powle # s views, that the Commander-in- Chief’s visit to Bushire, which was in any case to have been a visit of courtesy only, * shall be abandoned. As will be seen^from Mr. toilet’s telegram of 31st October^he is inclined to question whether we are on strong ground in pressing for the visit of the Commander- in- Chief to Hen jam and Abadan** on the ground that such a visit is covered by the Status &lt;iuo Agreement, but he proposes to -dipt wait a few days CinT the hope that the Persian Government will calm down. 0 Sir H. Hoare, in informal conversation, recently expressed the/————Mi—■—M—I the opinion that if the Persians,and particularly the Shah, were given time to get over their ill-temper, we might find them in a more accommodating mood. 2 * Mr* Millet has now replied to the Persian note protesting against our action in the case of the iviudir on the lines suggested by us on P.Z.6858/33. On the whole the interview seems to have gone off fairly well - see telegrams M 5 on P.Z.7083/33 - and Mr. toilet (who has handled the todir incident much more satisfactorily from our point of view than he at times handled the previous flag incident) seems to have refused to yield any ground to Persian pressure. 3. A separate submission has been made on the question of the position of the negotiations on Sir P. Hoare f s return (he leaves London tomorrow, but is, we understand, to proceed without instructions and see how the land lies at Tehran). 4. we have now received a full report from the Senior Naval officer on the Mudir incident (F.Z* 6934/33). The Admiralty, in the light of the report, support the action taken by sub-Lieutenant Bullock in arresting the Mudir, which was, in their view 'the only course properly open to him in a difficult situation', and consider that the orders given to Sub-Lieutenant Bullock as Officer-in-Charge of the Guard 11 came naturally and properly from the responsible officer charged with maintaining the status quo'.

Supposing his action lad constituted infringement of status quo we could have irdered Kudir to go hack to Persian B^sidu» I this would not have sufficed in view of freouent warning and .Mir’ s statement that he was acting on orders from aigner authority* (4 ) Minister for Foreign Mfairs then tried hard to get me to admit these throe actions were wrong. But of course I defended them on grounds that Mudir had asked for what M ^ had got. His Excellency reminM me that after flag inciaenl Persian l2„ Persian Government had admitted error and disavowed officers. I said that ther^ ^as no analogy* in that case Persian officers had caused that incident c Eciually now Mu dir had caused this one* (5) i-.s regards statement in Mejlis, Kazemi justified it on grounds that public opinion v as much disturbed and pretended most unconvincingly that news had reached Persian press from outside sources. He had been careful not to use inflammatory language9 I suggested silence might have served the purpose tetter, I rubbed in the contrast with our behaviour over the flag and also warned His Excellency that if British Press or Parliament now took up the matter he had only himself to blame for unnecessary publicity and the Shah's consequent probable fury* I rather think this had not occurred to him and he be came pensive. (6) As regards his allegation in Mejlis, that protests had been made by Persian Government this year about Basidu he said he could prove it from his files and would do soc (7) I then told him that His Piajesty's Government con sidered Persian Government's behaviour towards Commander-in- Chief’s visit unusual and offensive. I laid stress on the good effects of Admiral's visit last winter at the height of Anglo- Persian Oil Company crisis. How could the Shah's orders for friendly relations between navies be better fostered than by ^noiher similar visit? Moreover Commander—in—Chief must make his own enquiries and examine the situation on the spot and could thereby I felt sure contribute to remove misunderstandings. Puzemi said, that this threw rather a new light on the matter and asked5 ff asked if I could not write to him to say that Admiral wished to enquire into Basidu incidents# Suspecting a trap 1 said I vrauld write nothing of the sort after having received His Excellency s offensive note# He strongly disclaimed any intention of discourtesy towards Commander-in-Chief personally and excused apparent curtness of note on grounds of urgency of letting me kno.. his decision. He asked me particularly to explain this to you and to say no offence was meant. Persian Government had felt that in the circumstances visit was not opportune and might have led to some unpleasantness. I asked if he meant that Persian officials at ports could not control their subordinates in order to prevent any such thing. He said, they could of course hut still it was better for the present not to run any risk. Perhaps in a week or two objections to visits might no longer apply. I told him what rr as almost universal practice as regards naval visits in 'other' civilised countries and especially in United Kingdom. (8) I then speaking privately asked him what object there could be in aggravating situation, I urged caution and patience and above all emphasised that until we were convinced status quo was to be maintained I could not personally see how we could start any sort of negotiations. His Pxcellency e xpressed definite desire for a general treaty and enquired anxiously about delay in Sir R. Hoare's return. I said he ,/as still in London presumably because you wished to consult him, 9* Kazemi seemed impressed as to need for better re lations and hinted that if we would disavow action of navy in4, in removing Mrdir all would de well,, I told him most emphatically that I could see no prospect of our doing so and advised him to drop the matter* (10), He is taking note to Council of 1 inisters this evening 0 Addressed to Foreign Office No,299^ repeated to India No,123 and ' olitical Resident Persian Gulf No,137 and Naval Command e r~i n-Chi e f No c S Drfhis Docum ent is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] Decipher.

In view of doubtful legal position regarding our rights at Basidu and of undesirability of doing or saying anything which night further prejudice our position if matter went to arbi trations it is preferable that our defence of action of naval authorities in arresting Mudir should he based as far as possible on contention that Ludir's action constituted violation s ^tus Quo * You should therefore take the line that illegality of his action consisted in his attempt to exercise jurisdiction in a place s or in circumstances, where it had been agreed, in virtue of the understanding about the status quo , that Persia should not attempt to bring aboi t any change in the de facto situation, and 'where, under that de facto situation, Persia did not in fact exercise jurisdiction. Prolonged detention of Ludir and his eventual removal to Bandar Abbas can best be defended on ground that kudir stated that he was acting on written orders so that case could not be regarded as one of local ignorance or misunderstanding (cf, paragraph 4 of my telegram NOo 185 /of October 15/) sriT that best means of clearing up matter therefore seemed to be to hana over Mudir to his superior authority. n AtheSECRET . | INDIA DIRECT Kith the compliments of the f £( Secretary 0/ the Adminciltyt Admiralty Ref.

Sir, With reference to your letter No.E.6104/6059/34 Q f the 17th instant, regarding the arrest of the Persian gudir of Customs by the British Naval authorities at Bas idu, l am commanded by My lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to enclose, for the information of the Secretary of State for foreign Affairs, a copy of the written orders which were in force at the time of the Mudir’s arrest issued by the Senior p va i Officer, Persian Gulf, to the Officer-in-Charge of the Guard at Bas idu, together with a covering letter from the Senior Naval Officer. It will be observed that the orders do not contain any reference to the possible arrest and detention of Persian Officials, but they necessarily give to the Officer-in-Charge a certain amount of discretion, to meet any exceptional circumstances which may arise, and they authorise force to be used as a last resort. 2.

S.I.l. / No.144 —| 0 ,144 - see I ndia Office letter P.S. 6513/33 of the L October), it appears that the Mudir had already been Ltioned a number of times and hitherto, since the re- • Lfcli* merit of tlle P erma nent Guard at Basidu, had been iictili ous in asking for permission to visit the British fe a. It appears also from the Senior Naval Officer’s legram of the 13th October (repeated in the Political isident’s telegram of the 14th October), and from the 076 ring letter enclosed in this letter, that the Mudir Id asked what his position was as regards visiting the itish area, and had been told so definitely that the nior Naval Officer considered it would have been futile owarn him again in order to defer inevitable arrest. 3. The Officer-in-Charge of the Guard was faced with I he position that the Mudir, who had frequently been cautioned reviously, and to whom his position as regards entering the itish Area had been clearly explained, had apparently delib- &amp;tely evaded the Guard and boarded the dhow. In these rerunstances , My lords consider that simply to have sent back ie Mudir to Persian territory, as had evidently been done on number of previous occasions , would in no way have met the ise, and They are of opinion that the course taken by the / Officer-in-Charge ...) Officer-itt-Charge ox the G-uard was the only course properly open to him in a difficult situation. 4, hy herds fully recognise the d.es irahility of consulting His Majesty’s representative at Tehran as far as possible in dealing with matters which may affect the relations of this country with Persia. A difficult political situation has existed in the Gulf for some time and despite the fact that we have held Basidu for over a century, until now no effective steps have been taken to determine our exact position there. The onus, however, of seeing that the status quo at Basidu and at other places in tlie Gulf is maintained has been largely thrown upon the local Naval forces and it would be impossible for them to fulfil their duty in this respect without a certain amount of discretion being given to them. In all the circum stances, My Lords consider that the orders given to the Officer-in-Charge of the Guard came naturally and properly from the responsible officer charged with maintaining the status quo. 5. Subject to certain modifications which are noted on the enclosed copj/, the orders originally issued by the Senior Naval Officer are still in force. M.7 Lords consider / themthem 't 0 1116e 'k requxrements edecmately and are unable to ausgest any way in which they could be improved, but would be glad to receive the views of the Secretary of State upon them, in order that if they can be shown to be in any respect unsound , instructions for their modification may be given. 6 . As regards the general ouestion of consultation of His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran by the Senior Naval Officer before any dispositions are made which are liable to affect the relations of this country with Persia, My Lords feel that this can safely be left to the discretion of the Senior Naval Officer, who consults the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf as far as possible and keeps him fully informed of all that happens.

Once more he was plainly told that on no account was he to come into British Territory or waters in connection with his duty. If he desired, for private reasons apart from duty, to enter territory, he could do so in plain clothes, after obtaining permission from the Officer in Charge. (b) He availed himself of this and expressed gratitude for his treatment. I thought at least this would make for better understanding in his case. (c) As we were unable to take strong action after the Flag Incident, it necessarily followed that the Persians would create some other incident. H.M. Legation, Tehran, appeared surprised when one arose in spite of warnings from both the Honourable the Political Resident and myself. It was of course not possible to make a specific or detailed forecast. 3. When talking over the situation with the Officer in Charge, I told him amongst other things that he was on no account to allow interference with dhows in our waters. UnfortunatelyB^SIDU - APPREHENSION OF CUSTOMS MU DIR. Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, No. 177 / 4238 . 0 f 16th October, 1933. Unfortunately he was unable to prevent the Mudir doing so. In view of the warnings given to Mudir I suggest tnat a situation arose which is somewhat analagous 2 return after his expulsion, as suggested in aragraph 3 of Teheran telegram No.11 of 12th October. igP 4. In the circumstances I am satisfiis'd Officer in Charge acted as I would have done and I taFe full responsibility for action taken by him, otherwise the presence of the guard would have been ridiculous. u«d we intended to allow the Persians to carry on as they wish under the shadow of the insulted Flag, it should never have been rehoisted. ^ ^*T he ? e r Vi ?I s are 1 belieV€ shared by the Honourable the Political Resident, and must be by anyone who knows the Gulf and the situation as it is at Basidu. 6. The results of allowing incidents to pass unnoticed, or encroachments, with merely a protest, are to be seen in Henja* to day. Persian officials are in disproportionate numbers in our Naval and recreational base, where permission has to be obtained before stores for H.M. Ships can be taken from our own go-downs, permission which I am told by the Clers in Charge, is sometimes delayed or withheld on the excuse that there is no Persian subordinate to supervise and unlock the stores. Neither can a Sailor drink a glass of beer in his own Canteen without a Persian official watching to see he does not take it beyond the verandah. Eight years ago Henja* was as free of. restrictions for us as Basidu is to-day. 6. I have not yet received 'BIDEFORB’S* written report of enquiry into the incident. 7. To avoid delay I am forwarding a copy o$/this submission direct to the Secretary of the Admiralty by air mail. (Sd,) J*V. Creagh. CAPTAIN, SENIOR NAVAL OFFICER, PERSIAN GULF.OKDERS, A1N1P.

The guard will occupy what is known as the Guard House (shown on the plan as ’’Port” and on the chart as ’’Rest House”). 4. The customary honours are to be paid when the Union Jack is hoisted and lowered, for which an armed guard is to be provided. The changing of the guard is also to be carried out with due ceremony. 5.

It has been reported that Persian Customs Officials are in the habit of using the verandah of the Officers’ House at night to watch for dhows coming to British Basidu. It is also understood that Persian Tax Officials have been coming into Brit ish territ ory numbering the date trees with a view Jo collecting taxes, etc. It is contrary to previous experience that such incidents will take place while a guard is maintained. But it is xiecessary to be prepared. 9. All such persons are to be requested to leave the territory and the Officer in charge will see that such a request is carried out. All armed men are to be disarmed. There is no objection to their visiting British Basidu for recreation or in a purely unofficial capacity. Customs 10. Recently there has been the visit of the Governor of the Gulf Ports and the outrage committed on the British flag. 11. Should a Persian Warship pay a visit during the absence of a Sloop, the Officer in charge is to inform the nearest Sloop by W/T immediately, repeating to Senior Naval Officer. He should send a letter addressed to the Commanding Officer, to the effect that he regrets he has no Officer oi guard to call on the ship, but would be glad to know what he has come for and whether he has any passengers on board. He should also say he had no previous intimation and ask whether the Commanding Officer notified his intended visit. Further, that owing to a recent incident, the natives are apprehensive, and the Commanding Officer cannot therefore be given permission to land and is requested to leave British waters. ^ 12.

Though a situation will never be quite as anticipated it will be of great assistance to him if he has anticipated and visualised something of this nature, it may assist him to avoid undesirable complications. 14, He is to make out and keep a written daily report (in the nature of a log) and report personally, every day, to the Senior Officer when a British ship is present, bringing the daily report with him for inspection. These daily reports are to be kept for reference. 15.

Sir John Simon to Mr. Mallet {Tehran) (No. 435.) Sir, . , n , A w Foreign Office, October 24, 1933. THE Persian Charge d Affaires called to-day to hand me a copy of the note, dated the 16th October (copy enclosed), which the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed to you on the subject of the arrest by our naval authorities of the Persian Director of Customs at Basidu and his removal to Bandar Abbas. In receiving the document I told Fathollah Khan Noury Esfandiary that I had already received a full summary of the Persian note from you, that 'it was under consideration, and that you would be instructed as to any reply. It seemed to me that it would be unnecessary and confusing to duplicate discussion and I therefore proposed that this should take place at Tehran rather than in London. The Charge d’Affaires concurred, but added that his own position was somewhat embarrassing, as he had often reported to his Government that British policy in regard to Persia was one which would duly respect Persian sovereign rights, and the recent incident appeared to the Persian Government to indicate a complete disregard of this principle. I observed that both sides must duly respect one another’s rights and reminded him that we had had reason to complain of an earlier incident at Basidu, which was now happily closed. I hoped that the present matter would also be disposed of without much difficulty, and we relied on Persian co-operation for this purpose. I am, &amp;c. JOHN SIMON. Enclosure in No. 1. hote addressed to Mr. Mallet by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs on October 16. IT is with great surprise that I have received your note No. 529 of the 15th instant, regarding the inexplicable conduct on the part of certain British naval officers towards the Director of Customs whilst on duty at Basidu, and his subsequent removal to Bander Abbas. It is also surprising that the pretensions of His Britannic Majesty’s Government to the use of a coaling station at Basidu should have gradually assumed another form, giving rise to certain proceedings that amount to an infringement of the territorial rights of Persia, going even so far as to regard Basidu as a “ special British station, thereby excluding any recognition of the adjacent waters being within tne sphere ot Persian administration. j 2. Moreover, the Persian Government is at a loss to comprehend the application of the term status quo in this connexion, or the grounds upon whic i the British officers concerned can justify their action. . 3. The Imperial Persian Government does not recognise, oi has ever recognised, the possession by His Britannic. Majesty s Governmen o an} territorial rights at Basidu, or any claim to jurisdiction over the distnc . 4. I am further surprised that, at a time when nations aie enjomec o respect the rights of others, this action should have been taken by the iritis i aaval authorities, which undoubtedly is an infringement of Persia s em 01 rights, and, moreover, that they should have exerted armed interference withi Persian territory, causing the arrest of a Persian official engaged upon his lawful duties, having him removed to a warship, and then banishing im 0 ano • n- place. It is still more surprising that you should have reporte e ma ei as ff were quite a normal proceeding. [943 aa—1]2 5.

The meeting in the first place decided that while, as suggested in the draft, the visits to Ahadan and Henjam should take place, there could he no question of advancing the Commander-in-Chief’s prograrime. After discussion the draft was agreed in the form attached and in view of the great urgency was sent off last night. As it is in general conformity with the line recommended hy Sir P. Stewart and accepted hy the Secretary of State, I expressed concurrence in it on hehalf of this Office. 6. The Admiralty intimated that they had separately sent yesterday afternoon a telegram to the Command e r- in - Ch ie f warning h im l( j r ounuiici that while, in Idu, that view , and that as its ) X status/status was uncertain it was necessary to exercise extreme care. On the point raised by sir P. Stewart \ as to the desirability of maintaining forces, they indicated their entire agreement as regards Basidu and saia that they were instructing the Commander-in ch ief that on his departure thence the HAWKINS should he replaced hy a sloop, which should, for the present, lie off Basidu until the atmosphere became more normal. As regards Henjam it appeared that we have practically no force there at the moment, fhe Foreign Office drew attention to the possible risk; that sudden reinforcement might appear provocative.

It will be a week or more before Col. Fowle returns to Bushire to take over. We understand that the F.O. and Sir R. Hoare i are as a matter of fact very annoyed on account of Col.

As it is wo have spoilt decent case and. a protest to Persian Governmenc v/ill give them opportunity of quoting Macleod against us once Mudir is back in Persia and I could at once send in Note of protest taking the line that our position in British Basidu and its terri torial waters is consecrated by status quo agreement and tnat we have exclusive right of Government there and cannot tolerate intrustion of any Persian official. n 1 c o o7 . Tho above arsisnerit could also form basi s ox our reply if Persian rro .1 u .o 0 'caches me before I have you; authority to send in note of protest from Kis Majesty’s CrOvei-iiiienG* I coulc. also point out that Persians have o'Hy themselves to blame: that before flap incident they had already received several complaints about the conduct of Persian officials (e.p, Tehran despatches 109 and 363 ) and that since the incident I have emphasised orally the necessity m the interests of pood relations of Persian Government of issuinp strict instructions to all officials including Customs to refrain from provocative behaviour, I could add that thouph Mudir bolonps to Customs and not to the Navy the interference with the dhow off (?British) area is so contrary to spirit of recent assurances as to throw doubt upon sincerity of Persian Government or at least upon their ability to make their authority felt amonpst their own minor officials in the Persian Gulf and that in any case His Majesty’s Government cannot tolerate attempts to upset status quo in advance of resumption of treaty nego tiations. Whatever decision may be reached I would point out that if I am to get in my protest first it ought to go off on Saturday morning at latest. Ministry of Foreign Affairs is closed on Friday and there is reasonable chance they may not be ready with their protest before then.

Secondly, I do not believe story produced by Mudir at enquiry and evidence shows he inspected dhow’s papers. Thirdly, incident on arrival of flotilla reported in my telegrams of September 15th, T.48 and 1.49, followed by this incident shows Persian Government are either unwilling or unable to control their subordinate officers.

It is, of course, very tiresome that the Bartholomew Map should he so inaccurate. But I am not sure that it is not a good thing that Basidu should not he the only or the most obvious error. Our disposition here would/—orr 1 tile vdiulc, ! I thiftk^ he to leave matters as they are and | wait for the Persians to make representations. If and when they do, we are than in a position to reply (if the War Office confirm tnat this is the case) that we have no responsibility for the map; that, of course, there is no question of Jask being anything but Persian; bind that the position as regards Basidu is as explained by you in your letter to Noury of 5th January last, E 26/36/34; but that the general value of the map can be estimated from the fact that it has also omitted important boundaries in Arabia. 3. It is, of course, the case that tne communication you propose would be/ Kloe made to Bartholomews ana not to the Persians, hut we are inclined to douht if the error is likely to ao much harm as things are, ana on the whole think it preferable to abstain C? &lt;v* .

I am afraid that this new slip on a published since the events of last summer and since the Persian J.G. Laithwaite, Esq© Persian protest, is likely to bring yet another protest, particularly as this time we are apparently extending our imperialistic designs to other places in Persia. I therefore contemplated, with the concurrence of our Library here, writing to Bartholomew’s as in the attached draft# It occurs to me however that you may have views on this question; and I am moreover somewhat uncertain whether any communication which may be required had not better come from the War Office, who have no doubt co-operated in the preparation of the map. Incidentally, the map, which at first sight looks so accurate and complete, leaves out both the Koweit Neutral Zone and the Blue Line, and does not attempt to show the boundaries between Muscat and the Trucial Sheikhdoms at the end of the Masandam Peninsular# I am therefore holding up my letter to Bartholomew’s pending an expression of your views. Yours ever,' 6SS0/86/34 ] October 4 i n Bartholomew and 3 on»Ltd. Gentlemen It has been brought to the notice of the secretary of State that the map of co.;^jDnraiAL H The 1116die East* in the General World Series which you hare recently issued on the scale of 1:4,000*000 shows both Basidu (on the and Jask (on the Persian coast east of Bandar Abbas) as British* that is to say, each name- is followed, by the letters *M3r,)** Although there has in the past been some uncertainty as to the precise nature of the British rights at Basidu, it is desirable to make it clear that no part of B&amp;eidu can be regarded as British territory.

I do not think it would be out of place to mention with appreciation the fact that the Aden and the P.S.f.O. Bombay took the keenest interest in all matters affecting the comfort of the flotilla. Their efforts in dealing with the onward transmission of mails and stores were highly successful and they never failed to keep in the closest touch with the Senior Naval Officer. The M.T.O. at Karachi too was of great assistance. At very short notice he arranged for the transfer from the Slow Gulf Mall to the Fast Gulf Mall of approximately 400 packages on a Sunday morning, enabling them to be delivered to the ships on loth October instead of the 19th or 20th. The Base Transport Officer at Basrah, ‘Squadron Leader Burtenshaw and the FI. Lt. Craig, went out of their way to make matters run smoothly, and Corporal Green of their shipping staff is also worthy of special mention. The Clerk in Charge, Henjam, J.

When ’’SHOREHAM' paid a short visit to Basidu on 20th January, the acting caretaker, who appears to be performing his duties satisfactorily, had no incidents to report. He stated that the new Mudir took no interest in British Basidu and was sick. Hussain Haffaz (a former caretaker referred to in paragraph 11 of my Report of Proceedings for December) is giving no trouble to the Acting Caretaker, probably due to a threat to carry out his expulsion order if he did. Mr.V.A.L. Mallet, C.M.G., of H.M.

The President of the Mejliss addressed Dr. Tahiri informing him that he (hadgar) had told the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the two questions he wished to put, and that Eaaemi was ready to answer them. Dr. Tahir1 then rose and put his two questions. One related to the railway at Juifa in Azerbaijan* The other related to Basidu. It would be remembered that some time ago Fahirai addressed a question on this subject to the .Minister of Foreign Affairs, who replied, giving certain details and promising to give further information after certain step© had been taken. The reply of the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject of Basidu was as follows:- '‘In the first place, let me reply to the first question which the honourable deputy has put concerning the affair of the customs mudir at Basidu. Following upon the explanations which I submitted in this MeJlies in its sitting of the 29th Mehr (21st October, 1933) serious conversations were pursued both in Tehran and London, and written and oral requests were made as necessary. since the declarations made by the British Government did not agree with the views of the Persian Government, and since their statements were not satisfactory, the matter was gone into still further, until finally fcral and written explanation© were given to the Imperial Government to the following effectj This event took place by way of a mistake, without any mauvaise fol or desire to insult; and /meanwhile,- 2 - meanwhile, towards the middle of the month of Azar (i.e., about the 6th hecember 1953} the troops which the English had, without any right, Introduced into Basidu, were withdrawn, and the institutions which they had lately set up there without permission were done away with.

His Excellency replied that it was a statement of the Persian point of view and added that although naval detachments might have been landed before it had always been in the face of Persian protests.

He told me that the epidemic of malaria was a visitation of Allah. On being asked why, he said it was because the payment of the Khodadad Charity rund ior the use of pilgrims visiting the bhrine had not been made and that was why our guards hsa fever and we had been forced to evacuate. Also that Shaikh Moin, who had converted the last payment made co his own use, was now in debt, hated and an outcast.

Rendel Foreign IMPERIAL PERSIAN LEGATION, 10, Princes Gate, London, S.W.7. 1st January, 1934. My dear Mr. Rendel, I write to say that I have just noticed in a map which we have at the Legatioji, recently purchased from George Philip &amp; Son, Ltd., of 32, Fleet Street, E.C.4., and published under the direction of Colonel S.G. Burrard, Surveyor General of India, that Basidu is shown as ’’British”, which I have also observed in other maps. Although you have officially informed me that the British Government have no claim at Basidu, I feel that I should bring this to your notice. As I believe that the publishers of maps usually submit them to the competent authorities to have the details therein verefied before printing, it is possible that this error was not noticed by the department concerned. I shall be obliged if you will be so good as to take up the matter with a view to having the necessary rectification made in future issues. Thanking you in anticipation for the trouble I am causing you, Believe me, Yours sincerely, (Sd) F. Noury Esfandiary. Esq. , C.M.G., Office, S.W.l. IfFOREIGN OFFICE. S.W.l Mo.

I am sending a copy of your letter to the competent Departments in order that the matter may be looked into. 3. I think I should, however, mention at once that it is not quite accurate to say that we have officially informed you that His Majesty’s Government have 'no claim 'at Basidu'. As I have explained on more than one occasion, His Majesty's Government have in fact held a special position at Basidu for over a hundred years, and our view, as you know, has always been that, if there is to be any change in the position, such a change should be brought about as part of a general treaty settlement.

Hoare to Sir John Simon.—{Received January 16, 1934.) (No. 603. Confidential.) Sir, Tehran, December 19, 1933. I HAVE the honour to submit a detailed report of the audience which formed &gt;0 the subject of my telegram No. 383 o f to-day’s date :— 2. On my arrival at the palace I was greeted by Amir Nizam, the Shah’s private secretary, with the question: “And where is the military attache?” I told him that I had received, in reply to an enquiry from me, a perfectly definite letter from the Minister for Foreign Affairs saying that on the present occasion it would not be £ ‘ appropriate ’ ’ (incidentally the same word as in the note about the Commander-in-chief’s visit to Bushire and Abadan) for him to be presented to His Majesty. Amir Nizam replied that the Shah certainly wished to see him, and had intended to do so at the beginning of the audience. Amir Nizam was evidently greatly dismayed, and so I told him that the best thing to do would be to send my car back for Major Pybus, who could be presented at the end instead of at the beginning of the audience. The Minister for Foreign Affairs then arrived and they discussed the position in Persian. 3. When they had finished, Kazemi told me that he had received the letter of which a copy forms the enclosure to this despatch. I replied rather frigidly that I had expected to have an answer from him yesterday to my question whether it was by the Shah’s express wish that he had asked me not to talk politics at the audience. He said that he had been extremely busy, including a meeting of the Council of Ministers, and had therefore not answered, knowing that he would see me before the audience and, of course, I could be certain that he would not have said what he did except under His Majesty’s instructions. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and 1 then proceeded to the Shah. 4. His Majesty opened the conversation by asking whether I had enjoyed my leave, and reprovingly enquired whether I was really exhausted after only a year and a half in Persia. I assured him that the strain had not been excessive, but that I had while in England done a lot of things which I had enjoyed, such as- fishing, shooting and golf; moreover, it had been my privilege to hand to my Sovereign His Imperial Majesty’s message in reply to his telegram. The Shah replied that he was glad to learn this and requested me to convey his greetings to the King. 5. He went straight on to say that of course we must get on with the treaty negotiations as soon as possible, because he was quite convinced that once we had a treaty relations would be on so sure a footing that minor incidents would not arise and small misunderstandings would immediately be explained away. I said something in reply that seemed to me quite suitable, including an expression of opinion that even with a treaty I thought it doubtful whether we should never have another incident, and my impression is that, for the moment, he had quite forgotten about the mudir incident at Basidu. I rather fancy, though I may be wrong, that Kazemi reminded him. Anyway, he proceeded to say that of course the mudir incident must be settled before we could get down to negotiations, and he wished me to put in writing what I had conveyed orally to the Minister for foreign Affairs. 6. I replied that I would report his language to you, but I was quite willing to say off-hand that, if I had been at Basidu myself at the time of the incident. 1 thought it quite probable that the mudir would not have been arrested. It was also possible that if all naval officers were like me we should not have won the war. He must, in fact, have some regard for training and environment. This remark was received as a good joke, and it may possibly have disposed the Shah, who is a thorough oriental after all, to be reasonable, which he subsequently proved to be. I went on to say that I had just written to the Minister for Foreign [15 q 1]Affairs asking him to tell me definitely what use it would be pioposed to make of such a note; if it was required for communication to the Majlis we must proceed with caution. The Shah said, a little crossly, that it would certainly have to be communicated to the Majlis because public opinion in leisia was distuibed. I replied that I quite realised that, but we must beware lest in the process of calming public opinion in Persia we arouse opinion in England, which had entirely forgotten recent incidents in the Gulf, and provoke comments in the press, and possibly questions in Parliament, and so in the end find ourselves going up a sort of ladder of reciprocal comment and recrimination. I rather thought it would be a good thing if the Minister for Foreign Affairs showed the Shah what I had written to him. The Shah took my point at once—so promptly as almost to suggest that he already knew the contents of the letter—and said that he thought the matter could be settled if I sent the Minister for Foreign Affairs a note which would not be published, and if a simple statement were made in the Majlis that the incident was closed. 7. The Shah then began to talk about relations in general. He had wished to acquire his fleet-—if a few small units could be called a fleet—in England, as proof of his friendly feelings (it will be remembered that Teymourtache at one time gave my predecessor clearly to understand that the order for a small squadron would be placed in England); however, this did not come off, but he continued to desire a treaty and close relations with His Majesty’s Government because that was his personal sentiment; it must not—most emphatically—be thought that Persia stood in actual need of anybody’s friendship; he tendered his friendship, and tenders were out for a number of merchant craft; it might be regarded as certain that the order would be placed in Great Britain and other orders would certainly follow. Finally, he was most anxious that relations between his naval officers and ours should be cordial. 8. I expressed my gratification, and said that there were some features of the naval situation which I did not quite like, and I thought it would be a good plan if he would instruct Major Bayendor to pay an informal call on Colonel Fowle at Bushire and have a frank exchange of views with him. Major Bayendor would then learn what was troubling us, and Colonel Fowle would listen to any complaints which he had to make. 9. The Shah replied that, though it involved considerable expense, he had decided, as a clear indication of his intentions and friendly feelings, to send his sloops to call at some of the Indian ports. This was a definitely more marked indication of cordial feelings than what I had proposed; none the less, he would be glad to tell Major Bayendor, who was a most conscientious officer, to call on Colonel Fowle. I think the reference to the merits of Major Bayendor was elicited by my opening remark about the mudir incident. The Shah, evidently with the flag incident in mind, went on to say that he hoped I would not base my opinion of recent events on what I found in my files, indicating with his hands an imaginary heap of papers 2 feet high. I assured His Majesty that when I thought it wise I had the worst possible memory. 10. At, I think, an earlier stage the Shah mentioned the press, but so perfunctorily and m response to my statement that I wished to repeat the regret which I had expressed to Kazemi, as'to convey the impression that he was rather ashamed of himself. I tried to make it clear that he could not expect never again to read an unpleasant word. whip^ TTi^M 6 . co f versatioi 5 °f. a casual nature then ensued, in the course of which His Majesty learned with emphatic admiration that my wife had not yet returned because she was learning to fly, while I disolaved a similar entfmsmsm at hearing that the Valiahd is top of a class of P eighty-five boys. chanleH o ybu % Stl almos !; P al ? tm g from the haste with which he had changed into full uniform, was then introduced.

It was quite obvious throughout the conversation that the Shah had made up his mind to be good; he hardly once looked sullen, said most of what he had to say with a smile and looked quite genial and even laughed when my replies were translated to him. In general, he was much more at his ease than m either of the two previous occasions when I had serious conversation with him, and he was most highly courteous, noticing immediately, half-way through the audience, that I was inconvenienced by the sun and inviting me to share the settee of the King of Kings, which barely held us both—so courteous and so reasonable, that I almost blush, in recording the audience, at the ugly things which I have written about him. However, they are unfortunately true. 15. About ten days ago the Italian Charge d’Affaires told me definitely that the Persian sloops were to go to Bombay for a refit; three or four days ago he told me equally positively that they were not going; on the eve of the audience Kazemi urged me not to attempt to talk politics to the Shah, and on the morning of the audience he assured me that he had said this on the Shah’s instructions. Again, on the eve of the audience, I was, as stated above, informed by Kazemi in writing that it would be C£ inappropriate ” for the military attache to come to this audience. And so we have three sudden changes of the Imperial mind for which there is no apparent reason whatsoever. Was it to impress me or Kazemi that he was unwilling to talk to me or to see the military attache on Sunday and eager to do both on Tuesday, or was there something else which had nothing to do with either Kazemi or me? 16. To return to more substantial matters : The Shah is evidently still full of vigour, though I have the impression that he has aged a good deal in the last few months. 17. My general and very firm impression is that through all his fits of rage with us, and three in three months is a high average, his regard for us remains a constant factor. Is it possible that he is so entirely convinced of the wisdom of His Majesty’s Government that he is not afraid that he may one day, by uttering some particularly foolish threat in order to impress his compatriots, provoke His Majesty’s Government to take up his challenge? 18. In conclusion, the following point seems to me to merit special attention, obvious though it is : Had Kazemi gone to the Shah and said that I was making difficulties about his reading in the Majlis anything that I might be authorised to write on the subject of the mudir, Kazemi would almost certainly have come hack from the Shah and told me that His Majesty was absolutely insistent and the wrangle would have gone on. As it was, the Shah proved immediately open to reason. My belief is that in future difficulties our best plan will be to insist on Kazemi asking the Shah to send for me. It seems to me to be the only way of dealing with a constitutional Government, the members of 'which unquestioningly and literally obey their Sovereign when, in a fit of temper, he says : “ Tell the British to go to the Devil, and that you don’t believe a word they say,” his outburst being then passed on in the sort of representation recently made in London by the Persian Charge d’Affaires on the subject of the press. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 116) and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (No. 252). I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE. P.S., December 28.—When I delivered the note on the subject of Basidu, as reported in my telegram No. 393 of to-day, the Minister for Foreign Affairs referred to the audience and said that he had been very pleased at the Shah’s readiness to talk business with me. He then referred to my remark that the arrest of the mudir would probably not have taken place had I happened to be at Basidu at the time. I said that this seemed to amuse the Shah, and Kazemi replied that it did, and that His Majesty was also pleased with his rejoinder that had he been at Basidu at the time of the flag incident, it would certainly not have been hauled down. I did not press Kazemi to explain why he did not translate this at the time, but I record it as showing how much the flag incident has been on the Shah’s mind. R. H. H.Enclosure in No. 1. Sir R. Hoare to Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. (Personal and Confidential.) My dear Minister, December 18, 1933. ON thinking over our conversation of the day before yesterday, I find that there are two points on which I am not clear. The first is whether it was by His Majesty’s express wish that you suggested that I should avoid political questions in conversation with him; and the second is for what purpose you need the note which you are pressing for on the subject of the Customs mudir. This second question requires a little elaboration, and I will try and make my meaning clear. At some given moment any Government (Government X) may wish to be especially conciliatory to another (Government T), and may therefore be willing to take some specific action provided that the action taken is not a matter of public knowledge. The objections to publicity might be twofold : {a) Publicity might encourage other Governments to expect similar treatment; (5) it might, by provoking discussion and criticism in country A. undo the results achieved by the conciliatory action taken towards country Y. Allow me to apply this principle to the flag and mudir incidents (reserving, of course, our divergence of views on certain aspects of the latter). I can imagine that the Persian Government might, had the British Government insisted, have been willing to express formal regret in a note for the insult to the British flag on the understanding that such a note would not be published, and that they would have objected to its publication on the grounds that publicity would lead to discussion and discussion to recrimination disturbing to public opinion and destructive of the purpose for which the note was written. Similarly, but a fortiori with regard to the mudir incident, I have told you orally certain things, which you press me to write. Let us suppose that I wrote them and vou read in the Majlis what I had written. The result might well be questions in the British Parliament, the sense of which would be : Do His Majestv’s Government consider that the Mudir of Customs was justified in taking the action which led to the incident, and, if not, why have they adopted this unnecessarily conciliatory attitude?” Almost inevitably this'would lead to discussion of the flag incident and so on. In a word, we should once a^ain find ourselves involved in discussions and public recriminations and be prevented by them from getting on with the real task which lies before us. Will you be good enough to think this over in order that I may be able to put the position quite clearly to my Government ? Meanwhile I shall be most grateful if you will answer the question at the beginning of this letter on the subject of the audience in the course of the day. R. H. HOARE.Mr. Wa Sir L. ;on, ‘'Kershaw, ' “fclCj A—v-/ ^ &lt;4/ / With reference to Sir Louis Kershaw’s note on P.Z.490/34, I attach the latest telegram from sir H. Hoare, with the draft reply which the Foreign Office, in tne light oi sir Louis Kershaw's views, which have been communicated to them unofficially, wish to send. 2. The Foreign Office, as will he seen, are still not anxious to take a very strong line, and develop their arguments in kr. Warner's letter, which he offers to supplement by personal explanation if aesired. There is some force in their point that we are ciealing not with a iorrnal note, hut with a statement in the Majliss, our objections to which can be indicated with less formality than would be necessary in the case of an objectionable note. Apart from this, it is generally accepted that another effort should be made to reach a settlement with Persia by negotiation, and this being so it seems desirable to avoid controversy if this can be avoided without depriving us of a valuable bargaining point. On the whole, in- 2 - these eircunist^-nces and in the light of tne Foreign Office view, we might, I think, concur in the draft, though there is something to he said for suggesting the omission of its last paragraph, sir B. Hoare can he relied on to come hack if he feels any hesitation in going so far as the first two paragraphs authorise him uo go. The suggestion that he should inform the Ivi.F.A., while refusing to argue, that the Foreign Secretary is unfavourably impressed, is his own; we are meeting him over the question of the guard, and the addition which we suggest he should make to his remarks is not, one would have thought, of very serious importance. I might perhaps put this suggestion to Im. Warner as in the draft attached? Ut.i mXbt-UraXk—* 1 £v\. SLCUJ a a}J a/- fc /* *** ' ~ tr k m Uy ** c&gt; ^ ref -vv. X ^ ^ ^ A ■ tr Xr .

In the light of what you say we concur in the draft, with the modification that we should like to suggest the omission of its last paragraph, we feel that Hoare can he relied on to come hack if he feels any hesitation in going so far as the first two paragraphs suggest . We have met him over the guard; the suggestion that he should inform the Minister for Foreign Affairs, while refusing to argue, that the Foreign Secretary is unfavourably impressed, is his own, ana the small addition which the draft suggests to his proposed communication ought not (especially as he will have discretion as to how to put it) to make any mate rlai difference. j. G. LA1THWA1TE,FORKIGN OBFXCB,- S. W. 1, 24th January, 1934. 1 Q - ■ / E 482/26/34 IMPORTANT. My dear Laithwaite, We understand from Lascelles tnat you and he have had some discussion on Hoare’s telegram No. 15 of the 19th d'anuary, a copy of which went to you in our official letter E 482/26/34 of the 22nd January, and that the India Office feel that if we pass the inaccuracy of the latter part of the statement in the Majlis of the 14th January about Basidu, referred to in Hoare’s telegram No. 8 of the 15th January, without comment, there is serious danger of prejudicing whatever value our 'rights” at Basidu may have. 2. The Foreign Office view is that the primary consideration at this moment is surely to avoid the risk foreseen by Hoare in paragraph 3 of his telegram No. 15, that any reference at this juncture to our rights Laithwaite, Esq., India Office.rights at Basidu might ’’prevent us from reaching the negotiations stage.” I understand semi-officially that the Admiralty agree as to this. And we do not feel that H.M.G. f s position in the matter would he really affected if we did not enter a caveat . The uosition might be otherwise if the objectionable Persian statements had been made in a note to the Legation instead of in a reply in the Majlis. 3. In any case, we think it very desirable to allow Hoare latitude as to the precise wording of anything he may say on the point to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. I enclose a draft e legram to Tehran which is as far as my higher authorities would wish to go in the direction of a definite caveat and which they think would provide any safeguard that may be necessary. We much hope that the India Office will concur in it.

I would now propose to tell Minister for Foreign Affairs while refusing to argue that you are unfavourably impressed. With regard to possible landing of guards mere men tion of the possibility would if repeated to the Shah act at best to awaken his vigilant suspicion and at worst produce a storm. On the whole I believe that our 'rights' at Basidu have some value when negotiations are in progress but that to talk about them now might suffice to prevent us from reaching negotiations stage. May I put it this way? Assuming negotiations to be in progress and apparently likely to break down would you approve of a proposal from me to warn Minister for foreign Affaiis that the first result of breakdown would be the re-establishment of guards. I fancy that in view of (grjjnaeeU report (? you may) rejeet it as (?ehildish) Dluff because it might lead us to Geneva. Reference to my telegram No. 359 shows that I was in vour of Polloicd Resident's idea of evacuating every thing at Basidu and had fiaagres-s-b statement been un- aggressive I should probably perhaps have reverted to it now.

The appearance of this article, which is the first of its kind published since those reported in Mr. Mallet’s despatch No. 517 of the 4th November, and, indeed, since the morning immediately following the interview with the Minister for Foreign Affairs reported by Mr. Mallet in his telegram No. 299 of the 30th October, coincides with the outbreak of a fresh crisis over the article libelling the Shah in the Evening Standard. 3. Similar articles have appeared in the Shafagh-i-Surkh and Iran, as well as in the Persian section of the Setareh- ye-D)ehan. The latter differs considerably from the French article, but contains only one addition of importance, namely, that, in the opinion of the “ public,” there is no alternative, if satisfaction is not obtained, but to place the matter before either the League of Nations or the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague.

[E 7112/1329/34J Mr. Mallet to Sir John Simon.—[Received November 21.) (No. 503.) Tehran, October 30, 1933. THE sixth paragraph of the note from the Minister ioi* Foreign Ahairs about the visit of a Persian warship to the Island of Tamb, of which I sent you a translation in my despatch No . 498 o f the 27th October, stated that the Persian Government did not agree with the interpretation of the status quo agreement advanced by His Majesty’s Legation. 2. For convenience I quote the passage of my note of the 22nd August to which his Excellency was referring &lt;c 4. Your Highness is, of course, well aware that the claim of the Imperial Government to the ownership of the Island of Tamb is not recognised by His Majesty’s Government m the United Kingdom, and that the island is in the possession of the Sheikh of Ras-ul-Khaimah. The Imperial Government are, furthermore, precluded from taking any action in support of their claim by the existing agreement for the observance of \h.Q status quo in the Persian Gulf so long as negotiations for a general treaty are continuing ’ ’; as well as the actual words (in translation) of his Excellency’s reply “ As regards the observance of the status quo in the Persian Gulf, the interpretation which you propound in this connexion is not agreed to by the Persian Government, nor does it apply to this case, since the othciais of the Persian Government have always gone there and have always considered, and still consider, the said island as Persian territory de facto. 3. The Minister for Foreign Affairs told me, on the 15th October, that he could not find any “ status quo agreement.” I replied that it was not a written document. It originated some four or five years ago between bn R. Olive and Teymourtache. Since then, as treaty negotiations had never been broken ott, but only from time to time suspended, there had been an oral understanding maintain ^status quo in the Gulf. This was a common-sense matter, as obviously negotiations would be impossible if either side were to attempt during the period of negotiations to better their position m the brulf. His Excellency seemed to think this sensible enough, but he did not commit himself to any defii expression of opinion, perhaps because the question was new to him. 4. I have the honour to enclose a memorandum showing the mfoimation that it has been possible to glean from the archives of this Legation about the origin of the status quo agreement. I do not think its precise history is of grea importance, because I fancy that both Teymourtache and Feroughi, m their discussions with Sir Reginald Hoare, always accepted the fact that an unwritten understanding existed to the effect that neither side would disturb the existing position in the Persian Gulf, and that they accepted this understanding as one of general application to all matters and places in dispute. 5. This does not, of course, alter the fact that, when it comes to questions of detail the Persian Government please themselves as to the interpretation which they place upon the agreement, usually by pretending that some particular action on their part is in accordance with a practice in vogue before the agreement was made. This is, probably, what they are attempting to do m the present case, rather than to deny or repudiate the agreement altogether. Moreover, as I have already suggested in my telegram N o. 279 j )f the 23rd October, it is most unlikely that the Persian Government would have embarked upon this controversy at the present stage except as the result of extreme irritation at the arrest of the Mudir of Customs at Basidu. It is therefore possible that this declaration [971 x—7]has been made in a fit of spleen and is not intended seriously. But if the Persian Government do indeed intend in future to disregard the agreement altogether, a serious clash in the Persian Gulf will become almost inevitable. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foieign Secretary to the Government of India and to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (No. 185). I have, &amp;c. V. A. MALLET. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum. IN May 1928 Teymourtache told Sir R. Clive that the Persian Government would do nothing to “ brusquer ” Persian Gulf questions pending negotiations for a general treaty (see annual report for 1928, section 152). 2. On the 9th September, 1929, Teymourtache told Sir Robert Clive that “instructions had been sent that difficulties were not to be raised about Bahreinis pending the conclusion of treaty negotiations” (see 375/2-15/1 of 1929, and minutes at 375/2-4 of 1930 and 375/1-8 of 1931). 3. In October 1930 an attempt was made to obtain a written guarantee that the “status quo agreement” would continue during the suspension of negotiations (see annual report for 1930, section 108). Assurances were, however, given orally at the time by Teymourtache and Feroughi. 4. It is probable that on various occasions Teymourtache gave oral assurances regarding the maintenance of the status quo in the Gulf, but no precise record of them is available, or could be made available without going through the archives with a tooth-comb. In any case, there appears to be no written, or even recorded oral, authority for an understanding of the extensive nature that we now claim in regard to the status quo. 5. Nevertheless, the Persian Government have never themselves disputed that there does exist an understanding that neither side will do anything to disturb the status quo during treaty negotiations. They have even appealed to it themselves over restrictions on visits by Persians to Bahrein (see minutes at 375/1-14 of 1932). But the extent of the status quo has never been defined—the Foreign Office demurred to a suggestion by His Majesty’s Minister that an attempt should be made to define it—and, when it comes to details, the Persian Government please themselves as to its interpretation (see 375/2-4 of 1930).

HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of a note from the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, dated the 4th November, on the subject of the Basidu incident. Tehran, November 4, 1933. Enclosure in No. 1. Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to Mr. Mallet. (Translation.) M. le Charge d’Affaires, Tehran, November 4, 1933. YOUR esteemed note dated the 30th October, 1933, which was in reply to my note dated the 19th October, 1933, has been duly received. 2. It is understood from its contents that the question of the status quo is the only matter on which the representatives of His Britannic Majesty’s Govern ment wish to rely in upholding as justified the conduct of the naval officials in regard to the customs mudir at Basidu. 3. I do not wish, at present, to enter into discussions concerning the principle of the status quo in the Persian Gulf, which you describe as an unwritten “ gentleman’s agreement ” in the year 1928. I will postpone to a later opportunity the expression of mv views on this subject. But I wish to bring to your notice the fact that no judicial rights have ever existed for the British Government in any part of Basidu, and that officials of the Imperial Government have always carried out their duties in Basidu. Your own statement in your own note, to the effect that, “ in spite of repeated warnings which had been given recently to the customs mudir, the latter insisted on endeavouring to carry out his functions,” is a proof that Persian officials were carrying out their functions, and that the proper departments of the Persian Government were carrying out their duties in all parts of Basidu; and the Financial Department at Qish\have also always levied taxes in accordance with the law for the whole of the area of Basidu. Moreover, even assuming that it is necessary to observe the status quo, this state of affairs, whereby the sovereign rights of Persia are to be practised in that district, must be respected. In any case, 1 am certain that you will agree with me that the meaning of the term status quo is not this, that British repre sentatives in the Persian Gulf should perform fresh (unprecedented) acts every day in the Persian Gulf, and then, whenever the next day the Persian Government should protest, should reply that yesterday such and such a thing happened so that in virtue of the status quo the matter must remain in that state; nay, rather, all actions must be on a firm footing and all pretensions must naturally be based upon documentary foundations. Whereas, I regret to observe, no reply has yet been given to the Persian Government’s request, made on many occasions, the last of which was dated the 10th Khordad, 1305 (? the 31st May, 1926, approximately), to be informed of the document on which His Britannic Majesty’s Government base their statements and claims to Basidu. 4. The remarkable aspect of the Basidu incident is as follows : The conduct of the British naval officials, consisting of so many examples of conduct contra dictory to established international principles and contrary to friendship, is irreconcilable with any (definite) arrangement; and even supposing that the British Government might claim that they were taking advantage of that place, such steps should not have been taken by the British navy. [971 x—3]5 I must inform you plainly that the Imperial Government and public opinion in Persia rightly regard this conduct as derogatory to the sovereign rights of Persia and incompatible with the prestige of the Persian State, and cannot, bearing in mind the existing good relations between the two States, imagine any reason for this procedure; and they are certain that if the question were to be submitted to any international assembly, or to any impartial judg the decision would be emphatically in favour of Persia. 6 In conclusion, I deem it my duty to repeat my protest against the phrase mentioned in your note £t British area,” and, in accordance with my statement in my note of the 19th October, 1933, to renew the request of the Imperial Govern ment that reparation should be made for this conduct and punishment inflicted on the British officials concerned.

Political Resident in the Persian Gulf recommends x (sic: ? reconmiended) solution is for sum of money to he placed at his disposal to assist hard cases. He thinks most of inhabitants will prefer to remain even if exposed to Persian taxation, conscription, etc. , and that as they are so poor and few in numbers they are unlikely to suffer from discrimination. It is possible however that some might be deprived on one excuse or other of their date gardens. In the circumstances x of proposed x immediate evacuation, guarantees on such points are clearly unobtainable. But even if evacuation took place by agreement and guarantees could be extracted they might prove useless once we were gone. I therefore urge that Political Resident in the Persian Gulf be authorised to spend sum not exceeding £300 sterling in cash payments to enable any who fear retribution to settle elsewhere, and to compensate any who are deprived of properties. I submit that it is better to pay this relatively small sum than risk accusation now or later of deserting those who look to us for protection or hold up Immediately evacuation if this is considered clearly desirable on political grounds.

Instructions issued by them on receiving telegraphic report of arrest of Mudir of Customs at Basidu had obviously to be issued without delay in order that this official should not remain in detention.

I said we must be careiul lest in endeavour to put things right here we make them wrong in Eng 1 and where recent incident in the Gulf had been entirely forgotten. It would not do at all to produce anything here which might provoke press articles or eve ri questions in House of Commons which would revive Gne whole discussion; if that happened there would be more • o o2 . more talk here and so on and we should never get on with the task which we had in hand (this was the general sense of my ahove-mentioned despatch) D The Shah quite saw this and said that if I could write desired note he thought'all that would he necessary would he a simple statement in Parliament that incident was closed, I said I would report this to you. Something on the lines of my immediately preceding telegram would&gt; I think, meet the case. The Shall had rapidly become extremely friendly and talked about his desire for the best relations between naval officers, I replied that there was a good deal of misunderstanding and that I thought it would be an excellent thing if he would instruct Major Bayendor to pay an informal call on Political Resident and have a frank and friendly discussion. The Shah said he had decided to go further than this and send his warships .• to call at Indian ports but none the less would instruct Bayendor as suggested by me. With a veiled reference to flag incident he said as regards naval matters he hoped that I would not consult Legation files (indicating with a gesture a great heap of papers), I assured him that when it seemed wiser I had an extremely bad memory D As instance of his desire for friendly relations he mentioned order for commercial vessels which would almost certainly go to England and other orders would follow but these relations must be based on friendly feelings and it must not be imagined that Persia needed British friendship. At o « o3. close of audience i told the Shah plainly that we could not hope that Incident would never recur hut If anything was troubling him I hoped he would send for me at once 0 It is only yesterday that Minister for Foreign Affairs uold. me definitely that the Shah did not wish to talk politics with me nor to receive military Attach^ on this occasion and a day or two ago I learned he had reconsidered his intention to send warships to India. As a matter of fact he talked politics far more reasonably than on prev.Leus occasions with me or, judging from records, with ray predecessor and as regards military Attache on my arrival his Private Secretary seemed horrified to find that military Attache was not with me and I had to send for him post haste. I cannot pretend to say whether the Shah plays sardonic comedy with his ministers or whether he genuinely changes his mind.

Since incident which occurred at Basidu on October 9th His Majesty’s Government have devoted close attention to the question. The instructions issued by them on receiving telegraphic report of arrest of the Mudir of the customs at Basidu had obviously to be issued without delay in order that this official should not remain in detention. His Majesty's Government have since however examined the question in the light of more detailed reports received by post. They have accordingly reached the conclusion that they might properly have regarded the Mudir's action as a symptom of continual difference of opinion which has existed for some time past between our two governments regarding the true interpretation of the informal status quo agreement in the Persian Gulf in so far as it affects Basidu rather than challenge to basis df that agreement. They realize with regret therefore that their sole purpose - viz* to reaffirm their inter pretation of the status quo - would have been equally well served had they simply issued instructions for the Mudir to be sent back to his post in Basidu and had then brought to the notice of the Imperial Government what they regard as trespass. his Majesty’s Government fear that the Imperial Government may have formed the impression that the action taken by them causing the Mudir to be conveyed to Bunder Abbas was intended to2 , to inflict humiliation and I am instructed hy the Secretary of State for Foreign .hffails to remove this most erroneous impression if indeed it exists and to remind Your Excellency tk a t friendly relations have been maintained between our two countries for many years past and that it is their earnest desire that this traditional friendship shall not only continue but be increased to our mutual advantage.

If the fact that the visit of a Persian warship is without prior notification is to be ignored by the Haval authorities (particularly after the recent correspondence with Persia as to the need for notification only of a visit of a foreign warship to British ports), the inference is bound to be drawn by the Persians that we &amp;re no longer claiming British status for Basidu. It appears to 'Their Lordships that such action would be inconsistent with the instructions sent by the Secretary..••Secretary of Stato to tho Minister at Tehran after the recent Ministerial Meeting, to the effect that it is of great importance not to give away whatever right© we have at Basidu as this would destroy its value as a bargaining counter should it prove possible to resume negotiations, and that His Majesty*a Government are, in fact, in favour 'of continuing to bluff over our right© in Basidu and get what we can in exchange in Treaty' • It will be within the recollection of the Secretary of State that for some considerable time H*H* Government have maintained the attitude that Persian officials and vessels of war are not entitled to molest British Basidu* l*or example, in 19B8, when it was reported that the Persian Director of Oustoms at Bandar abbas was intending to proceed to Basidu with a gun boat to make an arrest, the Charge d*Affaires at Tehran was authorised to warn the Persian Government against any molestation of British Basidu, and at the ©am® time the Senior Baval Officer was instructed to resist any such molestation by force* There have, of course, been several other instances in which the same attitude was taken by His Majesty*s Government# In* ***•»•In these circumstances I am to suggest that should a visit of a Persian warship take place without prior notice, the least that can he done is for the Haval authorities to express surprise that the visit is made without notification. In regard to the possibility of a visit to Basidu a higher Persian Official, such as the Governor of the Oulf Ports, 'Eheir lordships presume that such an official might be conveyed in a warship, in which ease the instructions above would be applicable. If he 'were to land in the British area, or to enter that area from the Persian portion of the island they are of opinion that the instructions in telegram Bo *719 from the Admiralty to the Cornmander-in~Chief, last Indies, are applicable, namely, that if it should prove impossible to avoid taking note of the visit, the official should be warned to withdraw, but use of the expression “British Territory' should be avoided and force should not be employed.

HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of his note to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, dated the 30th October, on the subject of the Basidu incident. Copies have been sent to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (No. 184). Tehran, October 30, 1933. Enclosure in No. 1. Mr. Mallet to Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. Tehran, October 30, 1933. M. le Ministre, I HAVE the honour to inform your Excellency that I duly communicated to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs the contents of your note of the 19th October respecting Basidu. I have now received instructions from Sir John Simon to make the following reply :— 2. Your Excellency is no doubt aware that the status quo agreement to which I referred in my note No. 529 of the 15th October is an unwritten £C gentleman’s agreement ” reached in the year 1928 when the question first arose of embarking upon negotiations for the conclusion of a general treaty to cover certain questions outstanding between the Governments of the United Kingdom and Persia, and since orally confirmed with Sir R. Clive and Sir R. Hoare on numerous occasions by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the day. This agreement is in effect an understanding that until the negotiations shall have been brought to a successful conclusion or definitely abandoned neither of the two Governments will take any steps to alter the status quo in the Persian Gulf so far as the questions at issue are concerned. As applied to the British area at Basidu, the status quo agreement is held by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to mean that all such rights as have been enjoyed by them there during the 110 years of British occupation will continue to be enjoyed without Persian inter- rerence. These rights have always comprised exclusive British jurisdiction within the said area, where Persian officials, in consequence, perform no duties. ^Mhi 8 reason His Majesty’s Government cannot admit the intrusion of Persian officials into the British area, which constitutes an infringement of the status quo. 3. The Mudir of Customs was arrested because he insisted, in spite of many recent warnings, on attempting to exercise his functions in the British area in derogation of these rights, and when challenged asserted that he was acting under instructions from superior authority.

PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL. [E 7118/6059/34] No. 1. Mr. Mallet to Sir John Simon.—^Received November 21) (No. 517.) SiL , _ . Tehran, November 4, 1933. THE comments oi the Persian press upon the incident of the arrest of a Persian official at Basidu have in general followed the lines of the statements and arguments put forward in the Majlis debate of the 22nd October, a full transla tion of which has been sent to you under separate cover in my despatch No 501 dated the 28th October. I have no doubt that all the articles which have appeared were officially inspired. Three articles, however, merit some consideration. The first was an article published in the Shafaq-i-Surkh of the 25th October last, in which the text of my note to the Persian Government, No. 529 of the 14th October, together with that of the Persian reply of the 19th 'October (see my despatch No. 492 of the 20th October) was very faithfully summarised, and a few comments added. The second article appeared in the bilingual Setareh-ye- Djehane of the 27th October, under the title “ L’Incident de Basidu ”; a copy of the French text in original (of which an advance copy will already have reached you) is herewith enclosed./ 1 ) I have the honour to summarise hereunder the contents of the third article, which appeared in the Shafaq-i-Surkh of the 31st October as a leading article, said to be from the pen of one of the repre sentatives,” which is taken as meaning that the author was a Deputy of the Majlis. 2. The article is entitled “ Concerning the Basidu Incident.” The author first expresses his surprise at the incredible action of the British fleet, and observes that more extraordinary still is the fact that not only did the British Legation at Tehran not disown at once the action of the navy, but had the effrontery to hand in a memorandum couched in terms which made the matter much worse. Perhaps some people may regard the incident, which happened in a small and far-off island, an unimportant. This would be a great mistake. In the writer’s opinion the question is so important that it should be put at the head of all the international questions affecting Persia. The action of the British navy, and the tyrannous note of the British Legation, constitute a serious attack on the “ rights of sovereignty which we have possessed for so many thousand years in the Persian Gulf.” Although the Ministry for Foreign Affairs is evidently taking very proper steps in the matter, they must all do their utmost to support the Government in their efforts to uphold the undoubted rights of Persia, so that such encroachments and trespasses in the Persian waters of the Persian Gulf may be prevented. Modern politics demand that States should be powerful in order to protect their interests. They must spare no effort to show foreigners that Persia of to-day is quite different from Persia of the past. The Government, the mentality, and the practices of Persia have all changed fundamentally in the last ten years. Persia of to-day wishes for peaceful, benevolent, and friendly relations with all foreign countries. But she cannot endure that her undoubted rights should be assailed. She has undoubtedly possessed sovereign rights over the Persian Gulf, including its islands, for thousands of years. Every encroachment which foreigners may have made in the Gulf owing to the weakness of past Governments must now be removed, and Persia s rights restored. It is in the interests of the English that Persia should be strong. The Persian nation expects that foreigners will respect Persia’s rights. If not, she will protect her interests and spare no effort to make her rights respected. 3. The above language is so similar to that which the Iraq Minister tells me the Minister for Foreign Affairs held to him two days ago, that I should not wonder if the article had been written by his Excellency. According to Taufik [971 x—1] p) Not printed.Bey Swaidy, Kazemi seemed puzzled to know what to do next and how to f ^ f r\ rAaliQP that mnrlpm T^prei a iT-&gt; ^i.r Hi’s Majesty’s Government to realise that modern Persia (or in other Reza Shah) would not tolerate “acts of imperialism.’’ 4.

Hoare's telegram of 2nb December, No.354, on P.Z.7956, sug§ests that the Persians may be preparea to let Basiau rest for the moment. Miscellaneous papers of interest are the following;- (a) The proposal to reemploy one Hussain as caretaker (P.Z.7910/33). Hussain previously served in this capacity when trouble arose with the Persians because of complaints, apparently not without 5 °41 2000 1.31 ioundation, that he engaged in struggling. The Resident has in a separate telegram expressed the opinion that the chief essential is that tne caretaker should not2 tie a British subject, so that if the Persians molest him the gravity of the incident may he reduced, ana subject to this proviso he is prepared to accept any individual for whom the 3*N*0« should arrange. (P.Z.7958/33). (b) The text of the original British \ ■ Note of protest about the mudir incident and the Persian reply (P.Z.7921/33). (c) Pull report of the debate on the mudir incident in the Itajliss (P.Z.7922). (d) Correspondence between the 3.N*0., the Naval C-in-C, and the Resident, as to the desirability of abandoning Basidu/ The correspondence arises out of the Resident's telegram of 2nd December on P.Z.7832, putting forward the arguments in favour of taking the ^present opportunity to evacuate Basidu. In. reply Colonel Powle was instructed that | 'H.L.G. had decided, unless some radical change took place in the situation, not to give away such rights as we may have at that place, in view of their importance for bargaining purposes. In the meantime, however, the 3.N.C., much to the surprise ooth of the -admiralty and of the Naval C-in-C, had advocated (P.Z.7962) the immediate abandonment of Basiau on tne ground that we could cUandon it without loss of face at the present juncture on the pretext of the outbreak of malaria there'? The Naval C-in-C was not prepared to accept this view (see his telegram to the Admiralty of 8th December on P.Z.8013/33), and while the Resident returned to the charge in his telegram of llth December on P.Z.8011/33 the question of withdrawal may be regarded as having been shelved for the time being.

(Pape r No 0 14 E* (M) 31). (4) Letter from the Foreign Office to the Admiralty dated 25th November* 1933. (Paper 1 No. M.E.(M) 32). SIR JOHN SIMON said that he felt it would not be possible to resume treaty negotiations until the question of the Basidu incident had been closed. The suggestion made by the Admiralty that treaty negotiations should be started* while maintaining our present position at Basidu* did not appear practicable. SIR BOLTON EYRES MONSELL intervened to say that the Admiralty Memorandum* as presented to the Sub-Committee* did not fully e:xplain the position* and required to be considered in conjunction with a letter which he had addressed to Sir John Simon and which* with the permission of the Chairman* he would read to the Sub— Committee. The letter ran as follows :- H I suggest that the matters mentioned in your immediate letter of November 25th might appropriately be considered at the same time. I understand the Minister* s suggestion to be that the Shah should be told that we.have repented of the action which the Senior .Naval Officer* under instructions f rqffl His /, s Government , tooh in sending the Mudir oi B i To' 'B'andar'Abbas* and you also propose to withdraw the guard from Basidu. I see no otojection to the action recoMmended toy the Minister tout I think it would be a mistake to offer to withdraw the guard, etc.. 1 -of before treaty negotiations could be resumed, and there were a number of s in which it might be possible to dispose of this question. It might be done either by giving the Shah an assurance of the leeling of His Majesty’s Government and in dicating that there was no intention to humiliate Persia or, on the other hand, it might be necessary to take more definite action by withdrawing the guard from Basidu which had been put there after the incident of hauling down the flag by a Persian officer. In this connection he felt that Mr. Mallet, in his telegrams had been right throughout, and this was borne out by a telegram which had been received since Sir Reginald Hoarefe return to Tehran. Sir Reginald Hoare’s and Mr. Mallet's views v.ere that a mere apology would not be enough -and that some deiinite gesture'’ such as the withdrawal of the guard would have to be made to the Shah. SIR BOLTON EYRES MONSELL observed that the guard had been at Basidu olf and on before the flag incident occurred, and was not solely connected with that particular incident, although it had been the reason for the guard being placed and retained there all this time. He wondered whether the Shah could not he placated by words without necessarily being informed that action such as the removal of the guard would be taken. He suggested that it might be possible to express regrets and at he same time remove the guard or take such action as was con sidered desirable, but that no reference should be made to he action which would be taken when the expression of regret made to the Shah. SIR JOHN SIMON said that, while he agreed generally with the T it 0:i:&gt; s remarks, it had to be remembered that th 6 Law uflleers nn h indicated very clearly that it would not be c to suostantiate our claims at Basidu, where our f rights” h^ri a unfortunately no sound legal basis, while -3-we had no rights at all as regards Henjam. Continuing, he said he had brought with him the draft of a telegram which, if agreed to, might be sent to Sir Reginald Hoare and which he thought the Sub-Committee might like to consider The draft telegram read as follows:- You should now mahe to the Persian Government, either orally or in writing as you think best, a communication on following lines. Begins. His Majesty's Government have considered in consultation with you the best means of ending recriminations which have followed upon recent unfortunate incidents at Basidu. They feel that the surest way to put an end to all incidents in the Persian Gulf will be the conclusion of a general treaty. They wish once more to make it clear that the question of Basidu will be one of the matters to be dealt with in the treaty, and that, if a satisfactory settlement is reached on all other points, they will be prepared to surrender their rights in Basidu. In the meantime, relying on the assurances contained in Persian Government's note of September 12th, they have decided to withdraw the armed guard and sloop now maintained at Basidu. Ends. You should make a supplementary oral communication on lines suggested in your telegram No. 327 down to words 'repeated trespass', s adding: 'His Majesty's Government wish to assure Persian Government expressly that it is alien to their policy and traditions, and was absent from their intentions, to humiliate a friendly nation.' x The relevant passage of Tehran • telegram No. 327 reads as follov/s:- 'Having read the whole file I cannot see why His Majesty's Government should hesitate to say that instructions for dealing with Mudir obviously had to be issued without delay on telegraphic reports, and having now examined issue in the light of detailed reports they realise that their sole purpose, which was to maintain interpretation of status quo , would have been equally well attained had they simply sent Mudir back to his post and protested against repeated trespass, ...' -4—had bee also beContinuing, SIR JOHH SIMON said that the question of the guard and the sloop remained for discussion, and quoted from Sir R. Hoare's telegram, No. 3 S 7 , as folio ws: - Mf message went on to say that successful conclusion of treaty negotiations would setti,. , + oi PdbiQu m fersia s favour, and especially if guards were simultaneously withdrawn i am almost certain that tne Shah would drive his Government headiong into a general settlement ' nt nothing to lose by trying. Anyhow I see Alternative seems to be, as Mr. Mallet has pointed out, to risk all the evils resultant from driving the Snah into a rage in which he issues wild orders which his Ministers neither dare nor are physically in a position to withdraw. in oil dispute we bore this factor in mind with the happiest results. The fact that the country ated by one man who in some ci a lunatic is of course a great fact. u is absolutely domin- rcumstances rages like pity, but it is a The question was, would the Shah or the Persian Government be satisfied unless the guard and sloop were withdrawn. As regards the sloop a further telegram 35 had been received from Sir R. Hoare urging that it should also be withdrawn. THIS CHAIRMAN said that it appeared firstly, that we had taten action against the Mudir which was illegal, and, secondly, that we desired to uphold the alleged rights regarding Basidu, which could not be upheld in law. LORD HAILSHAM suggested that it might be possible to say that the armed guard and sloop would be withdrawn as soon as Treaty negotiations had been commenced. K The of Tehran telegram No. 332 is as follows J’l should not be greatly surprised, if maintenance of guard ship at Basidu continues, to receive note saying that this situation is clear violation of flatus quo which is therefore denounced. I submit that it is one thing to maintain a right to land a guard as and when we choose and quite another for sloop to succeed sloop on duty at Basidu with the regularity of sentries.” -5-SIR JOHN SIMON pointed out that both Sir Reginald Hoare and Mr. Mallet were of the opinion that it would be necessary not only to withdraw the guard but alao the sloop before the Persian Government would even consider the quest ion of resuming treaty negotiations, and had indicated that they did not think mere words, in the form of an apology, would be sufficient. xHil CliAlRMidl said he wished to be clear as to the situation if the sloop and the armed guard were withdrawn. What would our position then be in Basidu? kn. nAIiHv'/AITE said that the British flag would still be ilown at Basidu. The Secretary of State for Inaia in the India Office letter of November 27th to the Foreign Office^ circulated as Paper No. M.E.(M) 31 9 had suggested that they should proceed on a basis of informing the Persian Government that His Majesty’s Government were prepared to trust to the good faith of the Persian Government and therefore to withdraw the armed guard: there would, however, be no question if the guard was withdrawn of hauling down the flag or of compromising our position in Basidu in any way. LOAD HAILSHAM asked what the position would be if the flag were again hauled down. Mk. RnLDEL observed that on the occasion of the flag being hauled down the Officer who had committed tiiis act had been severely reprimanded by the Shah, that the Shall was all-powerful and that all Persian officials were terrified of him, and that, should such an incident happen again it could only be on the direct instructions oi the Shah. The best way of preventing the risk of such an incident, therefore, seemed to be to set matters right with the Shah. - 6 -SIR JOHN SIMON said t/Hat it was vsry evidGnt tlia'b tRs Persian Govemment had every intention of* referring the matter to uhe Council of* the League or to some other international tribunal ii His Majesty’s Government did not male a suitable gesture. it had to be remembered that the Law officers hc-d mane it clear that we had no legal right to Basida; and if the Persians did refer the matter to the Council the same situation would arise as when we referred the question of the Anglo-Persian Oilfields to the Council,, except that our position would be reversed. It seemed to him imperative that we should prevent such a reference to the Council of the League, otherwise we should risk losing both Basidu and Henjam, and the alternative of going to Bahrein was both inconvenient and expensive. It seemed that the only thing was to placate the Shah in order to be in a position to re-open treaty negotiations, but in so doing there would be no need to give up all rights regarding Basidu, He suggested that the removal of the armed guard, in itself, would not necessarily surrender our alleged rights in Basidu, as we v/ould retain the coal store, and, as had been pointed out, the flag would be left flying. He observed that a telegram had just been received (No. 870 of November 27th from Commander'-in-Chief East Indies) reporting a further incident with regard to interference with a Persian Customs Officer boarding dhows in what the Naval authorities termed ’’British waters”. He suggested that the Commander-In-Chief should be informed that i£i fact there was no such thing as British waters off Basidu; and if the Naval authorities persisted in using this term and taking action on the lines reported, he despaired of ever getting any agreement. He thought this &amp; spect of the situation might be communicated to the Commander-in-Chief, as it was most desirable to get the whole matter cleared up. •7-SIR BOLTOR EYRES MONSELL said that this most recent incident had passed oiJT without any particnlan comment. MR. HERDEL observed that it was not yet known what repercussions there would be in Tehran following upon this incident. It might still prove serious. SIR BOLTON EYRES MONSELL asked whether it was known that the Shah would not be satisfied with an apology and an expression of regret by His Majesty’s Government. LORD LONDONDERRY observed that Mr, Mallett and Sir Reginald Hoare had expressed the opinion that the Shah would be quite amenable if handled in the right way* SIR JOHN SIMON said that he was bound to take full account of the opinion expressed by the man on the spot, and in Sir Reginald Hoare 1 s opinion there was no hope of placating the Shah by a mere expression of apology. The only hope of re-opening treaty negotiations appeared to be to close the Basidu incident by the removal of the armed guard and the sloop, as suggested by Sir Reginald Hoare. It might, on the other hand, be sufficient to remove the guard, but allow the sloop to remain. MR. RENDED observed that until the flag was hauled down there had been no armed guard in Basidu for a very long period. After the flag incident the guard had been stationed there very ostentatiously and the Persians had protested vehemently. Mr. Mallett had said that if the guard were now withdrawn as part of the settlement of the latest incident the Shah would see to it that there would he no further incidents such as had taken place. - 8 -LORu LOrlDOi'l DPjRRY asked whether it was suggested that the flag should be left 1 lying without an armed guard to ensure that it was not hauled, down in the future. Slh JO.Ih oli.iOrl pointed out that it was actually the Commander-in-chief of the Persian Navy who had been responsible for hauling down the flag, and he had been very severely reprimanded. We, very rightly, had hoisted it again and had landed the armed guard. In view of the action taicen by the Shah he felt that if any further incident did occur it could only be with the authorisation of the Shah, and, for that reason, he felt that the flag would be fairly safe. In his view in fact the safety of the flag could best be secured by agreement with the Shah rather than by the maintenance of a small local force. He suggested, therefore, that the armed guard might be removed, but that the sloop should, perhaps, remain. MR. RENDER, in answer to a question, said that he understood that the dhows which the Persian authorities had sought to control had been described as lying some eight cables from the flag staff. Though there was nothing new in the sloop anchoring off Basidu, a new departure had been that one sloop now remained at Basidu until relieved by another. He suggested that if the sloop could be withdrawn for a time it might ease the situation. THE CHAIRMAN said that in the event of a further flag incident occurring it would be necessary to land the armed guard again, and if the sloop was withdrawn how would it be known that the flag had, in fact, been hauled down. LORD HAILSHAM observed that when the previous incident occurred the news had spread in a remarkably short time and indeed had been very detrimental to our prestige in the Persian Gulf. •— Q—*SIR BOLTOR EYRLS MONSELL said he felt there was a danger that the flag might be hauled down by some local authority and not necessarily on the Shah* s instructions. He thought that local protection was therefore necessary. SIR JOHN SIMON pointed out that Sir Reginald Hoare in his telegram No. 327 had stated that he could not see why His Majesty’s Government should hesitate to say that instructions for dealing with the Mudir obviously had to be issued without delay on telegraphic reports, and having now examined the issue in the light of detailed reports they realised that their sole purpose, which was to maintain interpretation of the status quo , would have been equally well attained had they simply sent Mudir back to his post and protested against repeated trespass. / SIR BOLTON EYRES MONSELL observed that they were all agreed that some form of apology should be made, but the difficulty was should they, or should they not, with draw from Basidu before treaty negotiations were re-opened. THE CHAIRMAN said that the Sub-Committee appeared to be reaching agreement. They were all agreed that the flag should be left flying, that treaty negotiations should be re-opened as soon as possible, that if the flag were .hauled down it would be necessary to land the armed guard again, and that the fact of the flag being left flying was sufficient to maintain our alleged rights in Basidu. As, in the opinion of the men on the spot, it was necessary to placate the Shah by removing the armed guard, it appeared to him to be the best thing to do with a view to re opening treaty negotiations. ■ 10 -SIR BOLTON EYRES MONSELL pointed out that if the armed guard and sloop were both withdrawn, and a further incident occurred, similar to the last, and the flag was hauled down, and it became necessary to land the armed guard again, there would be no hope whatever of re-opening treaty negotiations. LORD LONDONDERRY enquired whether, if the guard were withdrawn, the flag would be any safer if the sloop were allowed to remain. SIR BOLTON EYRES MONSELL said he thought it was very doubtful if the mere presence of the sloop would ensure the flag not being interfered with. SIR JOHN SIMON said he had been wondering whether it might not be possible to remove the guard and to take no official action as regards the sloop, but to suggest to the Commander-in-Chief that the sloop should v/ithdraw for a day or two and then return, as thought necessary. Undoubtedly it was the armed guard to which the Persian Government took so much exception, and if it was represented to the Persian Government that the guard would be removed - no mention being made of the sloop - and pointed out that, provided agreement could be reached in other matters, we should be prepared to surrender any claims to Basidu, it would greatly facilitate the closing of the incident. This would remove all unpleasantness, and we could offer to co-operate with the Persian Government in putting down slavery, etc., provided that the Persian Government assured us that no further incidents would take place. On these lines he felt that negotiations might be resumed. - 11 -THE CHAIRMAN said that one great point in favour of the removal of the guard was that the Shah had given an assurance that an incident vv 7 ould not occur again. SIR BOLIOH .SYRruo MOHShjLLi was of the opinion that they would he taking a great riskj arid thought it would be sufficient to make an apology, start treaty negotiations and then remove the guard. (nORD HAILSHAM then withdrew). SIR JOHN SIMON pointed out that Sir Reginald Hoare had stated very clearly that, in his opinion, the removal of the armed guard was a sine qua non to the re-opening of treaty negotiations, and in a later telegram 75 had added that the presence of the sloop might also preclude ( these negotiations being re-opened. THE CHAIRMAN said he did not feel quite happy about the complete withdrawal of the sloop, though it might be practicable to let it withdraw for a period and then return. If another flag incident did occur it would, in view of the Shah T s assurances, put him completely in the wrong. The withdrawal of the sloop and armed guard would not mean giving up the Basidu caret, but would really only entail playing the hand in a different and a better way. SIR JOHN SIMON asked whether the Secretary of State for India v;ould agree to the action suggested, i.e., the official withdrawal of the guard, but the sloop to remain, subject to any temporary withdrawal that might he agreed upon. MR. WAKELY said that the Secretary of State for India, while opposed to giving up Basidu for what it is worth as a card to be played, would agree to the withdrawal of the guard. * See footnote on page 5. - 12 -MR.

CONCLUSION. THE SUB-COMMITTEE agreed (a) To recommend the immediate withdrawal of the armed guard at Basidu, but not the withdrawal of the sloop; (b) That the First Lord of the Admiralty should consider the question of instructing the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, to make a temporary with drawal of the sloop, in order to ease the situation. (c) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in consultation with the First Lord of the Admiralty should be asked to draft a telegram 35 on these lines to Sir Reginald Hoare at Tehran. SIR BOLTON EYRES MONSELL said that he felt that these conclusions would be trying the naval authorities on the spot very highly and that there was a great risk of precipitating a further insult to the flag, with the consequence that it would be impossible to conclude any treaty. THE CHAIRMAN suggested that it should be recorded that there was no intention to imply the least blame on any of the naval officers who had been concerned in the Mudir incident. He suggested that a full explanation of the situation, as seen by His Majesty’s Government, should be sent to the Commander-in-Chief, in order that he might be acquainted with the way in which it was intended to carry on negotiations. x The telegram as finally approved and despatched is attached as an annex to these minutes. - 13 -SIR JOHN SIMON agreed that it should he placed on record that the withdrawal of the armed guard implied no criticism of any of the officers who had been in any way connected with the incident. THE CHAIRMAN observed that there was one other question raised in the First Lord's memorandum, and that was the purchase of land in Bahrein, He asked the First Lord whether he wanted to proceed with this. SIR BOLTON EYRES MONSELL stated that the Admiralty desired to go on with this, as a form of insurance, LORD LONDONDERRY stated that the Air Ministry also desired to purchase land in Bahrein. If the Admiralty were first in the market it would have the effect of sending up the price of the land. THE CHAIRMAN suggested that this was a matter which need not be considered by the Sub-Committee, and could be dealt with departmentally. MR. GRIEVE agreed and said that the question had already been discussed departmentally. LORD LONDONDERRY said it would be necessary for the Admiralty and Air Ministry to work together to avoid competition. SIR BOLTON EYRES MONSELL said that in any event the Admiralty did not want to figure as the purchasers of the land, as if the fact became known it might jeopardise their claims to remain at Henjam. -14-A short discussion then took place as to the essential features oi any treaty^ particularly in regard to Henjaiii,, which was entered into with Persia, SIR BOLTON EYRES MONSELL said the Admiralty were particularly cjixious to secure a. Binding agreement and to ensure that vexatious restrictions would not he enforced hy the Persian Government * At the present time there were a number of such restrictions which did not facilitate the use of henjam os a Naval Base and tended to cause friction Between the Persian Government and naval authorities. SIR JOHN SIMON agreed that this point would require consideration 5 and suggested that the whole question of the terms of the treaty would require to be considered when trie situation as regards Basidu had Been cleared up. CONCLUSION . THE SUB-COMMITTEE agreed :- to defer consideration of the essential features of a treaty with Persia until the situation as regards Basidu had Been cleared up.

Your telegram No. 326 (of the 23rd November: Mudir incident at Basidu). You should now make to the Persian Government, either orally or in writing as you think best, a communication on following lines. Begins His Majesty’s Government have considered in consultation with you the best means of ending recriminations which have followed upon recent unfortunate incidents at Basidu. They feel that the surest way to put an end to all incidents in the Persian Gulf will be the conclusion of a general treaty. They wish once more to make it clear that the question of Basidu will be one of the matters to be dealt with in the treaty, and that, if a satisfactory settlement is reached on all other points, they will be prepared to surrender their rights in Basidu. In the meantime, relying on the assurances contained in Persian Government’s note of September 12th, they have decided to withdraw the armed guard now maintained at Basidu, The flying of the British flag on the flagstaff would of course continue in the meantime in accordance with status g im.You should max-ce a supplementary oral communication on lines suggested in your telegram No. 327 (of the 23rd November) down to words 'repeated trespass”, adding 'His Majesty’s Government wish to assure Persian Government expressly that it is alien to their policy and traditions, and was absent from their intentions, to humiliate a friendly nation'.

My dear Gilbert, Following on our telephonic conversation of this morning about my suggested amendment on page 13 of the minutes of the Ministerial Middle-Bast Suh-Coraraittee Of November 28th, I enclose a copy of a ^letter which I have now received from Allen on the subject. You will see that Sir P. Cunliffe-Lister has not only not been able to accept my suggested amendment but, by inserting the word 'mudir' before the word ’'incident, 1 ' has maae the exoneration of the naval authorities spply specifically not only to the transfer of the mudir but to his original arrest, which was of course one of the chief points where we all felt that the naval authorities had exceeded their instructions. 2. If you should like to put your views on this question on record in an official letter, it might have certain ....certain advantages, though the matter is of course of somewhat academic interest now that the instructions to the naval authorities have been revised. 3. As regards paragraph 3 of Allen’s letter, please see paragraph 9 of my letter of November 30th to Allen of which I sent you a copy at the time. The point was of course that the telegram had already been drafted and was before the meeting in draft form when the conclusion was reached, and that the only alteration made in it was the omission of the words 'and sloop' as a result of the proceedings of the meeting. The point is not, however, of any particular importance.Committee of Imperial Defence, ^ Whitehall Gardens, S.W. , ^th December, 1933.

The Minister for Foreign .Affairs at once replied that I had given him nothing in writing* I said that if he wished It I was prepared to do so but should much prefer not to do so until the Shan had expressed a desire on the subject, as such an expression would show that things were going better. If they were not better there was the danger that the Shah migh reject our proposals in anger. The Minister for Foreign Affairs at first ex pressed a wish for a written communication to which I agreed.

At 11 a.m. the Mejliss opened under the presidency of H.H. Dadgar, and the minutes of the proceedings of the last session were read and passed. The president : Mr. Ssfandiari referred to me, as the result of information that he had gathered, asking that I ( should do my best in order to arrange that the Minister for Foreign Affairs should attend the session as soon as possible and give an answer to his question* I at once informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs and he conveyed to me his readiness to give the required answer. Haji Mirza fiassan Khan Eefandiari s An astonishing piece of news appeared in the papers last night and today and a number of the honourable deputies have come to me since last night asking that I should convey to them any information I had about the incident and the measures taken by the Government. As I had no information myself and as I was confident that my parliamentary colleagues were much perturbed in this connection ('it is true') and that others felt very much perplexed and alarmed at this event, I told the President overnight that, to remedy the situation, the beet thing would be to request the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come and offer explanations about the matter in order that, God willing, the general anxiety may be allayed. I read the news of the incident as it appeared in the papers: n Aefc4mishing News: ^According to information received, British Naval Officer who were in the district arrested a few days ago the Director of Customs at Basidu while discharging his /duties,duties, have taken him to a British warship, hare cross-* examined him and have then sent him to Bander Abbas on board their own warship* w This incident, which embodies several regrettable details, is causing extreme anxiety and astonishment ( M it is true w ), especially in this era and considering the present attitude of the Persian Government in t and the friendly attitude which it always observes in its relations. cm the other hand, while the whole world is demanding that all powers should maintain their mutual friendly relations, this incident is contrary to all inter-state stipulations and relations, and the general public are right in being perturbed about it ( w it is true* 1 ). The incident consists of three or four events that have all occurred contrary to our expectations and are of a nature to which every Government should object* I have therefore requested the Minister for Foreign Affaire to state in the Mejliss the steps taken by the Imperial Government in this matter and its various phases and details so that the people may be relieved of their anxiety and that such events may not recur and that we should also be reassured ( tt it is true 11 ). The Minister for Foreign Affairs : I regret to have to say that the information which appeared in the papers and which reached the honourable deputy was true (expressions of astonishment by the Deputies) and as the honourable Deputy asked that I should explain the course of events and the details of the incident, I will enter into details (the Deputies; 'Please tell us w ). This incident happened in a locality on Persian territory named Basidu. As the honourable Deputies certainly £nov 9 Basidu is the name of a village situated at the north- ftestern end of the island Qishm near the shore and a district /fcfof this vlllago, Known formerly onder the name ’Ohalamdani' is lately called 'Old Baeidu w . Since many years ago, that is to say since the period when Persia was weak, disabled and in a state of apathy, the British have, under the arrangements and methods in vogue in those days, known already to the honourable Deputies and needless for me to mention, built in this part of 'Old Basidu’ and without the permission of the Central Government of Persia, a coal-store and a small hospital for their Wavy. They added subsequently some more buildings to it, such as a travellers' house, etcetera, and they installed for some time a wireless telegraph there as well. Gradually they started a cemetery there destined for the interment of the Europeans who died in the Gulf region. The I British claim in 3 ust if* lost ion of thoir presence in this place has always heen based on the coal**store and the Persian Government has during recent times repeatedly protested against the interference of British naval officials in this place, considering it always a dependency (supplement) of the island of Qi&amp;hm and Persia's unquestionable and undeniable property. As to the details of the recent incident, they are as follows*— z , r fhe Customs official of Basidu had, in the discharge of his dut^ gone in the afternoon of the 17th Mehr Mah (October 9th), accompanied by his ferrash, to inspect a freight boat - ■ and' -make cnquir 1 os db out lying between old and new Basidu. The boat belonged to one of the inhabitants of Bander Abbas. As soon as he returned to the shore, four British armed military men came with an officer and an interpreter and put unjustifiable cjuestions lo the director of Customs and then took him and the ferrash to the Captain of a British warship which lay in that nQ ighbourhood; they were under arrest until some hours after /sunset•» 4- sunset and then they were transferred to another ship where they were again cross-examined and were sent to Bander ^bhas in a British warship (expressions of astonishment hy the Deputies). Worse than this incident is the note received hy the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on the 24th Mehr Mah (October 16th) from the British Legation, and as I am sure that the honourable Deputies will be interested to be informed of its purport, I give here some passages of that note (the Deputies: ‘♦please do’ 1 ). The afore-mentioned note has in the first place taken a high note by complaining about the Customs Director in Basidu who had inspected a dhow. Secondly, the region of the coal-store is defined as ’the British Area’ and any inspection in the territorial waters of that region is considered outside the scope of the duties of the Persian Customs Official; the note gives the details of the incident as follows About 6 p.m. on the 9th of October (Mehr Mah mh), the Customs Director landed from a &lt;£iow_which he had inspected. The dhow had anchored at-a Aiotanee-froi*' the shore of the British area in the coctefral (fl territorial-)- waters adjacent to that area. The nearest shore was at a distance of one mile within the boundaries of the ♦British Area* and the director was accompanied by his f err ash. Further on, the note admits that the Director was taken for investigation to one of the British ships which was anchored in the neighbourhood and that the Customs Director and his f err ash were subsequently landed at Bander Abbas. Thirdly, the note in question describes this step of the Customs Director as a breach of the status quo and in conclusion the Imperial Government have been requested to issue instructions to all Government officials in Basidu in order to ensure that the incident is not repeated. /It^ can be imagined Xt (-Ac-ovidentlji luwwr) to what an extent thi untoward hehawiour of British Mayal officials in regard to a Persian official engaged in the execution of hia official duties, hie arrest and cross-examination and his forcible removal from one point to another, as alao the strange interpretations put forward in the note have caused surprise and bewilderment to the Government. i protested forthwith to the British Representative in Tehran pointing out to him the importance of the matter and also instructed the Persian representative in England to take immediate steps in Lonaon. I wrote in reply a note to the British hegation, of which the following is an outline: !• xn respect of the claim of the British Government in regard to Old. Basidn 1 wrote: '’It is a source of great surprise that the claim which was maintained by His Britannic Majesty’s Government to a coal—store at Basidu has gradually assumed another aspect, thus involving acts resembling those of an owner and preventing the exercise of Persian sovereignty over the region. The area is even named the area special to the British and its territorial waters are considered outside Persian authority, whereas the Persian Government have never recognised, and do not now recognise, any British area or British right of -ifffrcrfcu^nee ^possessions in- Basidu a , ‘ In respect of the ’Status quo’ I enquired especially what the actual purpose was in forwarding the contention and what was the justification of the British officials* behaviour, I expressed surprise and amazement in regard to the treatment of the Customs official by the British Naval authorities in violation of Persian sovereign rights at a time when all bowers are . 0 onstanfely* invited to respect the /rightsrights of others; I expressed surprise and amazement at the armed intervention of British Haval forces in Persian territory, thereby arresting a Persian official in the exercise of his official duties within Persian territory and waters, imprisoning him in a warship and transferring him from one point to another* 4. I protested strongly and vehemently against three points: 1. The armed interference of British naval authorities in Persian territory and waters; Z. The repetition in several passages of the note of the reference to and the explicit mention of the ’British Area’ in Basidu and its territorial waters; and 3. The Irregular behaviour towards the Persian official in the foregoing eircuastances. At the end of my note I informed them that the Customs official and his ferrash were ^fto be ^ returned to their post ('hear, hear') ' and x earnestly requested the British Government to take steps to give reparation and redress for the incident and to punish the officials concerned ('hear, hear')* I furthermore instructed the representative of the Imperial Crovemment in London to take energetic steps and to protest vehemently in London also against this behaviour ('hear, hear'). After the foregoing explanations, the honourable Deputies will agree that the Government have not in any way fallen short in the exercise of their duties and I tfan unreservedly assure the honourable members that the Government will prosecute the matter with all energy and perseverance in order to ensure their satisfaction. I repeat once more in this official place that Basidu is the indisputable property of and an integral and inseparable part cf Persia and that no form of British Area* 014 British territorial waters and no kind of right of possession the British Government have been recognised or will In future r8C0gniaed ln that region ('it is true, it is true'), and /that- 7 - that in the same way that the Government* under the special aegis and guidance (lits patronage) of the powerful and august ruler of this kingdom* is fulfilling its patriotic and national duties in regard to all other affairs of state, so it will defend the sovereign and proprietary rights of Persia in this respect also ('hear, hear'). Haji MirgaJassan K^ian asfandiari s The Minister of Foreign Affairs* statements regarding this incident were very comprehensive, complete and sufficient. The raemhers of the Mejliss #ad, of course, no other expectation than that the Government were aware of their duties and were fulfilling them in the best manner We hope that in future also the Government will do its best and exert its utmost power for the protection of Persian rights, and will take all necessary steps for the settlement of this incident and for obtaining the results desired so that in this case redress may be given and its recurrence avoided.any further communication on this subject, please quote No. ^ C &amp;&amp;/(£?£/- and address —not to any p/rson by narrfe., but to— „ The Pnder-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1. i INDIA DIRECT TT 7 &gt; presents his P. £ . ^ O i / j THE Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs 1 gomplinients tO'^2*Cc and, by direction of the Secretary of State, ^ transmits herewith cop ^ &lt; of the under-mentioned paper.

His Majesty s Government in the United Kingdom regret that they have to complain to the Imperial Government regarding a case of interference by the Pei sian Mudir of Customs who is stationed in Persian Basidu, with a dhow lying’ oft the shore of the British area at Basidu. 3. The mudir, who has repeatedly been cautioned by officers of His Majesty’s ships against interfering with the existing arrangements at Basidu, was seen at rUtoi 0 C • m the evemn g on tile 9 th October, landing from a dhow which ne had been inspecting. This dhow was lying immediately off the shore of the “area and in the territorial waters adjoining this area. The nearest point on the shore (and the point where the mudir landed) was about 1 mile within the boundary of the British area. The mudir was accompanied by his fesrrash. 4. This action on the part of the mudir was a clear infringement of the status^ quo, under which, as the Imperial Government are aware, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom exercise exclusive rights in connexion with offici area a ^ Basidu, where they cannot tolerate intrusion by any Persian A/r &gt; , T]l e m udir, on being taken for investigation on board one of His jest.y 8 shl P s which was then lying off the British area at Basidu, stated that i 18 wr ^ en or ders were definitely to the effect that he was to board all dhows lying off any part of Basidu. s ^ a ^ emen ^ made it impossible for the British naval authorities to egaid the case as one of local ignorance or misunderstanding, and with a view n e satisfactory disposal of the incident the senior naval officer has accordingly an* 3 ] 1 mstract ed to land the mudir and his ferrash at Bandar Abbas without delay , 0 1I 7 0 ^ m Governor of Bandar Abbas that a complaint regarding the uct ol the mudir is being addressed to the Central Government at Tehran, i t ‘ ^ that your Excellency will take all necessary measures, in the offip'i r n 0 . 0 ^ re ^ at ^ ons ’ tp cause urgent and precise instructions to be issued to , /A 8 a “ ™ds i n toe neighbourhood of Basidu which shall ensure that there be no recurrence of such incidents.

I RECEIVED with the utmost surprise your note No. 529 of the 15th October, 1933, regarding the inexplicable treatment given to the Mudir of Customs at Basidu while the latter was performing his duties, and his removal to Bandar Abbas. . 1 , . . , . . 2. It is a source of great surprise that the claim which was maintained by His Britannic Majesty’s Government to a coal store at Basidu has gradually assumed another aspect, and that His Britannic Majesty’s Government have now taken action as if they were the owners thereof and are preventing the exercise of the sovereign rights of Persia in that place, and have even called it a special British area and consider its territorial waters as being outside Persian jurisdiction. 3. The authorities of the Imperial Government do not know why the status quo has been invoked in this connexion, and with what justiheation the British naval authorities have taken this action, since the Imperial Government have not recognised, and will not recognise, any British area or any sort of proprietary right of the British Government at Basidu. 4. I am astonished to the utmost degree that, at a time when all Powers are invited to respect the rights of others, such action has been taken by the British naval authorities in infringement of the sovereign rights of Persia, that the British naval forces have had recourse to armed intervention, have arrested a Persian official within Persian territory and waters while in the performance of his duties, and have imprisoned him in a warship and removed him from his post to another place, and that you have reported this to me as if it were a usual In view of the foregoing I now record in the name of the Imperial o. Government the strongest (possible) protest against the armed intervention on the part of the British naval forces in Persian territory, the irregular treatment of the Mudir of Customs at Basidu, and the (use of) the term “special British area ” which has been repeatedly mentioned in the note under reply; I bring toyour notice the fact that the Customs Mudir at Basidu and the Customs ferrash have been sent back to their post, and the Imperial Government earnestly call upon the British Government for immediate redress for this behaviour on the part of the British officials and their punishment.

A quantity of correspondence continues to fe received on this subject, it is perhaps unnecessary t /0 examine it in d-btail^ though reference may he invited to trie Admiralty reply on P.z.7577 to Foreign Oil ice criticisms oi the action of the 3.N.O., and to the s.N.O.'s Report on the incident itself on P.Z.7281/33. 2* fhc most important recent development is the discussion in trie Ministerial Middle Fast Committee or the 28th November, (a provisional record of which is flagged), consequent on the memorandum circulated to the Ministerial Middle iia st Committee by the .First Lord of the Admiralty, which will be found on P.Z.7733/33. Tne Secretary of State was unable to be present personally, but approved the line suggested in hie departmental note ilagged K as that to be foll- i owed by the India Office representatives. In the light of the discussion in question, of the report of further incident at Basidu contained in the Naval Commander-in-Chief ’ s telegram No.87 0 of 27th November, (P.Z.7791/33), and of Sir R. Hoare*s telegram of 26th November, No.332. (P.Z.7721) suggesting the desirability of ceasing to maintain a guardship at Basidu, the instructions on P.Z.7790 were sent to the Naval ~J y 1 ^ Commander-ln-GLief «*na those on P.Z.7794 to H.M. Minister at Tehran. It will be seen that in tne interests of providing a sop which might mollify the Persian Government and reduce the effect of the Muoir incident on relations with Persia, and the risk that an attempt might be made to take it to arbitration, approved the formula of apology suggested by Sir R. Hoare in his telegram No.327 dated 23rd 2119 5000 8.33 No vember/- 2 - November on P.Z. 7666/33, nna authoriseo blm in addition to iniorni tbe Persians tnat, xelding on tde assurances which they had given us at &lt;^n earlier stage we were prepared to withdraw the guard which was maintained at Basiuu. The First Lora, at the meeting of the Ministerial Middle Fast Committee, was strongly opposed to withdrawing the sloop as well as the guard, and in deference to his objections this was not pressed. But the admiralty subsequently agreed to a suggestion made in the meeting by sir John Simon that the sloop should leave Basidu, and that while visits should be p.aid to the station by H.M. ships from time to time, the unbroken watch by a sloop which has been maintained since the Mudir incident should be abandoned. 3. Sir H. Ho are made the communication authorised to the Persians on November.' Unfortunately g-iac? th^^-the crisis over the “Evening Standard* article criticising the Shah, regarding which a separate submission is being made, had developed; ana the Persian Prime Minister merely remarked in reply that he thought our offer in regard to withdrawal of the guard did not amount to very much, it seems probable that in the circumstances the effect of our demarche may have been almost wholly wasted, //e can, however, do no more than await developments.

Yon will rememc-or that the first Lord t*ice emphasised that the action of the naval authorities in removing the Mudir to Abbas was taken on direct telegraphic instructions I^oa His Majesty's Government. It was in respect of this action tuat the Jub-lowaittee decided to convey an exorea- .icn oi regret to the Persian Government. The first Lord * ds ni turally moat anxious that in saying this to the Government there should be no suggestion of our . , *0.£. Allan ^ trying AT 1 r X9Q *. t 01 imperial .Defence.tr?ing to pvt the blame for the action for miich w© were '-w - t \ doOiO^nhng on tne local^authorities. I understood him to feel some nervousness lest the fora of * 0 rds suggested )y our iinister at iohran might be open to such a construe- tion, ana it &amp;as for this reason that he wished it placed on record in the minutes of the meeting that the Sub- Ooaaittee regarded no blame as attaching to the naval authorities in resoect of the action which they had taken ^ as ^ iG b-oro had been at pains to make it clear in his letter of November 27 to Sir John Simo^quoted at the beginning of tn© minutes) on specific instructions from ais Iajesty f s Government. 3.1 an quite sure that it was on txiis understanding buc*t Sir John Simon agreed to what was pro nosed. On the otaer hand, the minutes, as originally drafted, are 0v)ea to u ;:;i true tion; and if tne oassage I ''^ 1 §^sted is not inserted^all the departments con- ernet l 1av 1 themselves committed not only to a full Nation oi the condict ol the naval authorities in Maportiag the Lludir to ;, »andar Abbas, but to a statement s ^?fchiag wxiich tne naval authorities nave done in the ...ths ijulf during tii8 last f*©« Months lias boon above criticiam. 4. I do not think there is an? question now oi pursuing iurtaer the rather barren correspondence ‘'^ich was recently onened with the Admiralty as to how far the standing instructions of our naval authorities m txis Gulf really covered all tiieir recent proceedings, it would not be possible for 3ir John Gimon, in the light of that correspondence, to comit himself to so general a statement as that indicated in the paragraph, fou may remember that the prime Minister recently expressed serious doubt as to the justification ol certain of the actions of the naval authorities, and tnat trie matter was taken up as a result of minutes by It is one thing to let that question drop as being no linger of practical importance in view of what has subsequently occurred » but quite another, it seems to me, to pre judge the issue by allowing a general exoneration of -verything that the naval authorities have ever done to an pear in the record of a meeting, when what was actually ...'v ^ Ik t l i l ’■ U: t,i Si to it o El 'lo VS*' actually under discussion ms only one specific action on their part. 5. The addition which I have suggested to tne first Lord 1 s remarks on page 13 seems to me accurately to represent the sense of **hat was said and at the same time does not in an? way weaken the force of the conclusion which was come to. 6. In these circumstances, as the issue of the iinal minutes is nos no longer a matter of immediate urgency, I hope you may be able to put forward ray suggestion again. 7* I am sending a copy of this letter to Laithwaite of the India Office, Yours sincerely, (Sgd) 0. xiEMDEL.For-acm OFFICE, s.'r.i 30th ? ?ove ; aber» 1933* Dear Allen, I return herewith tne copy ^ou sent &amp;e of the u.raft ;ainuteB of tne Mini isle rial oiaale nst Duo-Co rait tee icetiiig ;?f Doveaber Seth, on which I have suggested in pencil a certain number of alterations. The great majority of these are in Sir &lt; ohn Simon's or ay own reaaiice and I think are self-explanatory. One or two others are merely* verbal anu intenaea to make the sense a kiltie clearer. But some require special explanation. lh the araft telegram on page 4, I have re-inserted the words “and sloop,* which were in the original draft telegram, although they were omitted from the telegram as finally sent. The point of this is th t the presence of the words in the original draft led to a long discussion about the retention of the sloop, an theythey should I think therefore apnear at thie stage. If you think it desirable, however, a copy of the telegram as eventually sent (our telegram No, 225 to Tehran, of which I enclose a copy for convenience of reference) couia be attached as an annex at the ena of the minutes. 3, sDn page b I nave inserteu a short additional paragraph after Sir John Simon's first remarks^ referring to the further telegram from Tehran recommending the withdrawal of the sloop. You will remember that the text of this telegram was not available at first, but was eventually produced by the First Loru ana reaa out t^Rir J* bimon. As ft is :&gt; treiiely important, I think this text should appear as a foot-note on page 5. I enclose a copy ol the telegram in question (Tehran telegram 552) w hich is very short. On page 6 I have altered the word ’’Note’* in 'Sithwaite's remarks to read 'letter of November 27th to ^etgn Office,” which, T think,is the correct eR 'ription of the document. 5. On ...•6.
