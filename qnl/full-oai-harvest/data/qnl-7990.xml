The regulations were all published in the Saudi newspaper Umm al Qura [Umm al-Qurá], and consist of the following: a high decree published 15 May 1931 (folios 43-45); a high order sanctioned by the Legislative Assembly, 8 Safar 1352 [2 June 1933] (folios 39-40); and a regulation issued by Ibn Sa'ūd ['Abd al-Raḥmān bin 'Abd al-'Azīz bin Fayṣal Āl Sa'ūd] on 3 Shabān 1354 [31 October 1935] (folios 29-34).The file also includes correspondence between HM Minister at Jedda (Andrew Ryan), the Foreign Office, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Lieutenant-Colonel Trenchard Craven Fowle), the Political Agent at Bahrain (Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Gordon Loch), the Political Agent at Kuwait (Captain Gerald Simpson Hillairet de Gaury), and the High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan (Arthur Wauchope), discussing: the impact of the regulations on tribesmen from Transjordan, Kuwait and the Trucial Coast; the difficulties of enforcing the regulations in the hinterlands; and concerns that Ibn Sa'ūd intended to use the regulations to impose his influence on tribes who moved into Saudi limits from Qatar and Abu Dhabi.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references found in the file by year. This is placed at the end of the correspondence (folio 2).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>District Magistrate, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Saudi Arabia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Hejaz</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002e3#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002e3#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
