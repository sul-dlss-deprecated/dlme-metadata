AENCLOSURES. Enclosure No. 1. Foreign Office to India Office. No. 15,027. Foreign Office, _ 25th May 1911. I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to transmit to you here with, to be laid before ihe Secretary of State for India, copies of two despatches from His Majesty's Consul at Muscat, enclosing for approval certain King's Regulations issued under the provisions of Article I. of the Muscat Order in Council, 1867. Sir E. Grey proposes, subject to the concurrence of Viscount Morley of Blackburn, to approve the regulations enclosed in Major Trevor l s Despatch No. 426, of 28th March last. With regard, however, to those enclosed in Major Trevor's Despatch No. 476, of the 4th ultimo, it appears to Sir E. Grey to be at least open to some doubt whether it is reasonable or defensible or necessary for the peace, order, and good government of British subjects to make the mere presentation of a complaint direct to the Local Government a criminal offence punishable by fine and imprison ment, and he would be glad if he could be furnished with the views of your Department on this point. 1 am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State W.

In continuation of my Despatch No. 426, dated 28th March 1911, I have the honour to forward herewith for approval a draft Regulation under the Muscat Order in Council, 1867. This regulation was also included in the draft Regulations made by Major Hayes Sadler in January 1895 referred to in the above-mentioned Despatch. Perhaps the draft Regulations which I have submitted with my Despatches No. 399, of 21st March, and No. 426, of 28th March, should have been embodied in one general regulation, but as 1 am not certain of the correct procedure in regard to this, I have kept them separate. If this is not correct I trust I may be excused. I have, &amp;c., A. P. Trevor , Major, His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Muscat. Sir Edward Grey, Bart., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. s. 7a. BAnnex 2.

In pursuance and by virtue of the powers invested in His Majesty's Consul by Article 1 of the Muscat Order in Council, 1867, British subjects and British protected persons residing in Muscat and Matrah are hereby forbidden to prefer any complaints or make represen tations direct to the Local Government, as such proceedings give rise to inconvenience and tend to create complications with the local authorities. In cases of emergency the assistance of the local authorities may be invoiced without the intervention of the Consulate, but a report of the circumstances must be made to the Consulate as early as the nature of the case admits. Any person contravening this Order will render himself liable, | on conviction by His Majesty's Consul, to punishment by fine or I imprisonment as prescribed bv Article 4 of the Muscat Order in Council, f 1867.

British Consulate, Muscat, ir ' . . 28th March 1911. In continuation of my Despatch No. 399, dated 21st March 1911, I have the honour to forward herewith three draft regulations under the Muscat Order in Council for approval. The first of these diaft regulations deals with municipal matters in Muscat and the adjoining town of Matrah ; the gist of the regulation has long been in force, and my archives show that it was included in some toq 1 ?? P^P. ose ^ ^S^ations'' which were drawn up on the 1st January f b &gt;: Ma J 0 1 r ( now Sir J -) Ha yes Sadler, at that time Consul at Muscat evidently with a view to submission to the then Secretary of State for approval. There is however, nothing on my record to show that this was ( one or that the proposed regulations were approved, so, with a view to placing matters on a regular footing, I now beg to submit a draft for approval. I have slightly amplified the original d?aft regulation bv adding some details regarding penalties.Tt is hardly necessary to say that' no municipalities or general conservancy arrangements exist in Muscat or Matrah ; on the other hand no rates or taxes (except customs duties) are levied ; thus such conser vancy arrangements as do exist devolve upon householders and tenants in accordance with local usage and occasional orders by His Highness the Sultan. The second draft regulation was also included in Major Sadler's draft regulation of 1st January 1895. The clause relating to penalties has been added by me to Major Sadler's draft. The third draft regulation deals with probate and administration of estates. Clause 1, referring to the reports of deaths within 48 hours, has long been in force here, and was embodied in Major Sadler's draft regulations. The remainder of the draft regulation has been added by me with a view to ensuring the better administration of the estates of British Indian subjects, a large number of whom reside in Muscat and Matrah. The draft Clauses II., I\ T ., V., and VI., have been adapted from the u Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council' as being in my opinion suitable to this part of the world ; as regards Clause VII., court fees in ordinary suits have been levied on the scale of the ' Indian Court Fees Act of 1870,' for many years past by rule of Court, and as practically all the estates to be administered are those of British Indians, it seems advisable that the fees for probate, &amp;c., should be levied on the same scale, and that the ' Indian Succession Act, 1865,' and the ' Indian Probate and Administration Act, 1881,' should be used as a guide to procedure, &amp;c., by the Consul. Should, however, the draft regulations dated 1st January 1895 have been submitted and approved, and should it be considered undesirable to amend them in the manner I now venture to suggest, I respectfully request that I may be furnished with a copy of the approved regulations for record in this Office. I have, (S:c., A. P. Trevor , Major, The Right Hon. His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Muscat. Sir Edward Grey, Bart., M.P., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. Annex 4. Notice. From Turki bin Saeed, Sultan of Muscat, to whomsoever may peruse this, to wit:— It is incumbent on everyone who has a house or shop to clean the portion of the road in front of the same and to remove the rubbish, and whoever fails to do so will be liable to pay the cost of the work, which will then be performed by the order of the local authorities. In like manner in the case of any wall of a building which shows signs of decay it is incumbent on the owner to repair the same to avoid injury to the passers by, and in order that no opportunity be afforded for the accumulation of refuse matter. In case of disobedience to this order the dangerous wall will be pulled down by the order of the local authorities, who will then allow the expropriation of the materials of the same, and the owner shall have no ground for complaint. Let this be known and salaam. Dated at Muscat the 27th Rabi-ul-Akhir 1305 (12th January 1888).Annex 5. MUSCAT. Notice.

Sir, I have the honour to address you on the subject of the provisions of the Mashat Order in Council of 186? and the arrangements for the custody of persons sentenced 'by H.M's Consular Court to lenghty terms of imprisonment finder the said Order. such persons cannot be confined for considerable periods. The only place at all for their reception is a small cell about 8 feet by 12 next door to the Treasury. This serves well enough for the temporary detention of one or two persons for a week or so but is entirely unsuited for the .i-' coption o: 4 ' prisoners for long periods. They cannot be subjected to proper discipline or even restraint. ^• The result is that it is necessary when prisoners are sentenced to longer periods to appeal to His Highness the Sultan of Maskat for permission for them to be confinad in one of His iiigliness's forts. Confinement of this kind is open to two objections arising from different cau/ses. If the prisoner happens'to possess important and influential fx'x^nds, the Consul has no guarantee whatever that they axe even kept in custody and it is possible for the prisoner's fx-iends to arrange that such a punishment shall be so You are well aware that on the Agency premises.alleviated 'bhat it ceases to be a punishment at all and is no deterrent to crime. On tiie other hand should the pri- -soner 'be a person who is obnoxious to the Doral Government it would be difficult to ascertain that he was treated witte, common humanity. 4. ^ortounately,the occasions/on which it is necessary to resort to severe terms of imprisonment are so rare that it would be a waste of money and still more of important building spare to suggest the construction of a prisoner's room or anything in the nature of a small jail. 5. A simple solution suggests itself and that is the addition to the Maskat Order in Council of an article on the lines of article 2S to be inserted between articles 25 and 24 of the aforesaid Order in Council legalising the detention of prisoners sentenced to terms of imprisonment exceeding three months in the common Jail of Bombay terri- -tory there to undergo the terms of imprisonment to which they may have been sentenced by the Consular Court. A draf t of the suggested addition is attached to this letter and marked Appendix A, 6 - Such an addition would however entail a lengthy correspondence and in any case an application for the alter- -ation of the Maskat Order in Council would not be attended to witnout the support of the Government of India and I nave therefore the honour to request that, if my suggestion is so fortunate as to meet with your approval, you will be good enough to move the proper authorities in the matter. It is however possible that there may be a simpler method of arranging for the detention of such prisoners in the common Jail at Bombay or in one of the Sind Jails. The latter proposal would result in economy to Government in t r prisoner's travelling expenses. It would be a matter for expert legal opinion to determine whether a simple executitte order to the governour of one of these Jails directing him to receive prisoners duly sentenced by II.B. U ' s Consular Court at Maskat would suffice without anaddition to the Order in Council under the provisions of w V/ which- they have been sentenced. In the Order itself I an unable to find any directions as to where the sentences of imprisonment to which prisoners nay be subjects are to be undergone. 8, In Appendix B, attached to this letter I have noted on a case that has brought this question prominently to my notice and I trust that I have there said sufficient to indicate that the scandal is a crying one, that the local commercial community needs education in the sense of their responsibilities and that I nay venture to hope for your strong support in the proposal I have had the honour to bring forward.

It shall 'be lawful for His Britannic Majesty's Consul to cause any British Subject, convicted before His Britannic Majesty's Consular Court at Muscat of the coirmis- sion of any crime or offence and duly sentenced for such crime or offence by the said Consular Court to suffer a term of imprisonment, whether rigorous or simple, exceeding three | months, to be sent in any of His Majesty's Ships of war or any British vessel to His Majesty's territory of Bombay; and it shall be lawful for the Commander of any of His Majesty's S'ips of war or of any British vessel, to receive any such person on ooard wit' a Warrant from the said Consul addressed to tne Chief Magistrate of Police of the said territory, and thereupon to keep and detain in lawful custody ^nd to convey him in custody to Bombay, and on his arrival there to deliver || htm, witn the said Warrant, into the custody of the said Chief Magistrate of Police, or other officer within the said territory lawfully acting as such, who on receipt of the said Warrant, and of the party therein named, shall be authorised to commit such party to the Common Jail of the said territory; and it s all be lawful for the keeper of the said Common Jail to cause sue party to be detained in safe and proper custody until the expiry of such period of imprisonment whether simple or rigorous as shall be named in the Warrant from the said Consul aforesaid in the same manner as if the crime of which he ias been convicted had been committed, and the said accused person had been duly sentenced by any of His Majesty's Court, witnin His Majesty's said territory of Bombay. 1to letter No, dated IGtli October 1911 to the address 2- of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Commercial morality in Muscat is unfortunately lax in the extreme and I regret to say that, in my opinion, this laxity has been encouraged Toy the fact that there has hitherto 'been no suitable method of dealing with such offences as are detailed in Sections 405 to 424 of the Indian Penal Code, It is of course possible to commit eLuch cases to the High Court of Bombay under Article 2Z of the Muscat Order in Council of 1867 and pres-umably any prisoners sentenced by that Court to imprisonment would be forthwith committed to an Indian Jail without further question. But proceedings in the High Court of Bombay would be hampered in the extreme by the trouble and expense involved in sending witnesses, even if British Subjects, such a long distance and by the consequent reluctance of all such wit nesses to come forward and give evidence. The matter becomes still more complicated when the nature of the case happens to call for the attendance of Arab witnesses. His Highness the Sultan of Muscat will send such witnesses readily enough to our local Court, though their evidence has to be received with great caution owing to the fact that they are not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court but, if His Highness were requested to send such witnesses to the High Court at Bombay, he would probably and, in my opinion, naturally, refuse point blank, i-no mere fart of the Consul being empowered to direct that such prisoners should be sent to an Indian Jail to undergo their sentence would act as a most powerful deter- n0 W rent to crime, in a case that is/pending in this Court evidenro ; as been given which, if substantiated, would go to provecivil ( jU - prove that a felony was connitted arid that a/case was actually over the claim that arose out of the felony instituted in this Court/about a year ago. As soon as there was a risk of the facts coming to light, all parties concerned injured party including the and the heads of the community com bined together to compound the felony and recorded, with touching confidence, the result of their deliberations in a document of compromise. The natural result was that the felon continued his career unchecked and is now under trial with fifteen claims brought against him of a similar nature from this one complainant alone, lie has other so called creditors both British and Arab whose claims against him amount to some $*10,000 The accused is a man of straw, utterly unable to meet the claims against him, even if they were compoundable, and I suffer under the imputation of being unconscionably harsh and unreasonable because I refuse until the accused shall have cleared himself of the grave accusations brought against him to accede to the proposal of his creditors to allow him to continue to rob Peter to pay Paul, by which means they hope that some portion of their losses may be recouped to them. They fully realise that if the accused is convicted and sen tenced their money is gone, 'What they do not realise is that they are entirely to blame, as the whcble community has been well aware of the state of affairs for a Considerable period of time.BritiBh Rasidancy and Consulate-Uaneral. ^ si ?

The death of any British subject or British protected person m other parts of Oman shall be notified to the Consul at the first opportunity. 2. The Consul may, when the circumstances of the case appear to him so to require, as soon as may be, take possession of the property in Oman of the deceased, or put it under his seal (in either case, if the nature of the property or other circumstance so require, making an inventory), and so keep it until it can be dealt with according to law.

If a person who has been named executor in a will, and to the establishment of whose title as such it is necessary to obtain probate of that will, takes possession of and administers or otherwise deals with any part of the property oi the deceased person and does not obtain probate within one month after the death, or alter the termination of any proceeding respecting probate or administration, he shall be punished with a fine which may extend to 500 dollars. 6. If any person other than the person named executor or administrator or a person entitled to represent the deceased person without obtaining probate or letters of administration takes possession of and administers or otherwise deals with ^ any part of the property of the deceased person, he shall as soon as practicable communicate the circumstances to the Consul, and shall furnish to the Consul all such information as the Consul requires, and shall conform to any direction of the Consul in relation to the custody, disposal, or transfer of the property or the proceeds thereof, and in case of contravention of this article he shall be punished with fine, which may extend to 500 dollars. 7.

Personally I am inclined to think that Court fees once collected should not be refunded. The parties have had the assistance of the Court,and one or both of them should pay for it. In case of a compromise being arranged it could be settled then,among other matters,by whom and in what proportions the costs of the 6uit (including Court fees) were to be paid. As you only ask for Rs.200/- for refunds in the year,and as this amount would presumably be apread over several cases, it seems to me that the Question cannot be of great moment to any individual litigants at .asQat. I am disposed to reply to your Official letter in the above sense,but should be glad first to have any remarks you wish to make.

The said rules will be held to apply to all arms and ammunition or parts thereof held m our territories by traders for sale on the date of the introduc- tion ot the said rules, and to all such arms, ammunition or parts thereof as may be thereatter imported into our territories. On, or about, but not before, the 1st September 1912, a subsidiary notice will be issued in due course confirming these draft rules and notifying date on which the rules so confirmed shall come into operation. 3 &amp; the. eL ft 'SL r RAFT/ RULES. Rule 1. All arms, ammunition or parts thereof, held by traders for sale to the public witmn my dominions, shall be deposited forthwith in the Arms Warehouse m accordance with these regulations. The Warehouse Superinten dent will giant a detailed receipt to the depositor for all such arms, ammuni tion or parts thereof in the form attached and marked A. Rule 2. After the expiry of one month from the date on which these rules come into operation, all arms ammunition or parts thereof, found in the possession of traders (except in accordance with the provisions of rule 15 hereinafter mentioned), contrary to the provisions of rule 1 aforesaid, shall be confiscated. If the offending trader be a Maskat subject, he will be severely punished ; if a foreigner and amenable to my jurisdiction, he. will be liable to expulsion from my territories. If the offending trader be a subject of any of the Powers in treaty relations with me, information will be laid against him to the Consul of the Power, whose subject or protege he may be, and the aforesaid Consul will be requested to deal with him according to law and treaty and the spirit of these regulations. Rule 3. In addition to all or any of the penalties imposed by these rules, should any trader be found guilty in the proper forum of offending against the provisions ot rule 1 aforesaid, all arms, ammunition or parts thereof, held in the Maskat Arms Warehouse to the credit of such offending trader, or that may subsequently be deposited in the Arms Warehouse in his name under the provisions of rule 4, will, without further sentence of forfeiture, be liable to confiscation. Rule 4. All arms, ammunition or parts thereof, which may hereafter be imported into Maskat territory, will be taken direct to the Arms Warehouse and there deposited. Rule 5. For the more effective carrying out of the provisions of the preceding rule, the masters of steamers importing arms and ammunition or parts thereof will be required to produce on arrival and furnish to the represent ative of the Warehouse Superintendent who will attend on board, the copy of a separate manifest, and in the form attached and marked B, showing all arms and ammunition and parts thereof, destined for importation into my territories and carried on board their vessels. Rule 6, All arms, ammunition or parts thereof, destined for import into Maskat, but not detailed, or incorrectly or insufficiently described, in the separate manifest (form B) especially with regard to the marks on tiie packages or the name of the consignee, shall, as soon as such arms, ammuni tion or parts thereof have left the ship's tackles become liable to confiscation. Exception. The sole exception to the operation of this rule shall be in the case of arms, ammunition or parts thereof, landed by mistake in good faith and clearly destined for some other port, to which the import of arms and ammunition is not prohibited. The burden of proving tlvit such arms and ammunition were intended for import to a port, to which the import of arms and ammunition is not prohibited, shall lie on the steamer's agent, importer or consignee. No claims under this exception will be entertained after a period of three months from date of landing of the goods, in respect of which the claim is made.Rule 7. All arms, ammunition or parts thereof, deposited in the Arms Warehouse in accordance with the provisions of rule 4, shall be claimed by the consignee within a period of three months from the date of deposit in the Arms Warehouse. On such claim being made, the Warehouse Superintendent will, subject to the provisions of rules 8 and 8 {a) immediately following and after due veri- fication of the Bill of Lading and steamer's agent's delivery order, grant a detailed receipt in form A above-mentioned. Bide 8. As soon as, in accordance with the provisions of rule 4 aforesaid, arms and ammunition or parts thereof are brought to the Arms Warehouse to be there deposited, the Superintendent, Arms Warehouse, shall notify the Superintendent of Customs of the arrival of such arms, ammunition or parts thereof bv form attached and marked C Arabic in oidei that duty may be collected thereon by the Superintendent of Customs. Rule 8{a). As soon as such duty has been paid, the Superintendent of Customs shall immediately return to the Superintendent, Arms Warehouse, the form marked C dulv endorsed with a certificate that the duty has been fullv paid on the arms, ammunition and parts thereof noted in the form aforesaid, and the Superintendent, Arms Warehouse, shall in no case grant the detailed receipt in form A unless and until he shall have received back the form marked C duly endorsed as already described by the Superin tendent of Customs. Hule 9. Failure by consignee to comply with the provisions of either of the three preceding rules shall render the arms, ammunition or parts thereof liable to confiscation. Issue of arms, ammunition or parts thereof from the Arms Warehouse. Rule 10. Any person proposing to purchase arms, ammunition or parts thereof from any trader, owning arms, ammunition or parts thereof stored in the Arms Warehouse in accordance with the provisions of rules 1 and 4 above, and duly claimed under the provisions of rule 7, and on which duty and warehouse charges have been fully paid in accordance with the provisions of rules 8 and 16, respectively, will be permitted to withdraw arms and ammunition or parts thereof on the production of, and to the extent covered by, a license in form marked D and attached. On the application of the trader concerned, who must be present at such, withdrawal, the Warehouse Superintendent shall draw up the license aforesaid and submit it for my approval and signature. Rule 11. It shall be the duty of the Warehouse Superintendent to refuse to draw up any such license, should he have reason to suppose— (a) that the purchaser whose name it is proposed to enter in form D as ' bearer' intends to resell the arms, ammunition or parts thereof to any other person; (&amp;) that such purchaser is already, whether by license in form D pre viously issued or otherwise, in possession of arms, ammunition or parts thereof, whence it may be inferred that the arms, ammu nition or parts thereof, covered by the license under question, are not required solely for the personal use or protection of the purchaser. Rule 12. It shall further be the duty of the Warehouse Superintendent to ensure that— {a) all rifles issuing from the Arms Warehouse under the terms of any license, issued in accordance with the provisions of .these rules, shall be clearly marked on the barrel before withdrawal with the official mark and on the butt with the serial number of issue; (b) no more than 200 rounds per rifle per annum shall be issued from the Arms Warehouse to any holder of a license under form D; (c) in the event of a license under form D being issued for ammunition only, which must not in any case exceed 200 rounds per annum per purchaser, the purchaser produces, for the inspection of the W arehouse Superintendent, the weapon in respect of which the ammunition is required* /Rule 13.—On the production of the weapons as directed in accordance with the provisions of Rule 12(c), the Warehouse Superintendent shall pro ceed to satisfy himself that the weapon is duly marked on the barrel with the official mark of the Arms Warehouse and on the butt with the serial number of issue. If it is found not to be so marked, the Superintendent shall, after marking the weapon with the marks and number of the Arms Warehouse, refer the question of the legality of possession of the weapon to me for orders. The burden of proving that the weapon was innocently come by and not in infringement of the rules of the Arms Warehouse, will lie on the owner and should he fail to prove innocent possession, the weapon shall be liable to con fiscation. Rule 15.—To meet the needs of traders who may desire to expose in their shops a sample of arms and ammunition for sale, a trader's license in form E Arabic form ( ) can be procured by them from the Warehouse Superin tendent. A trader holding such a license will be permitted to withdraw from the Arms' Warehouse one sample weapon of every kind of which he may have stock lying in the Arms' Warehouse under the provision of Rules 1 and 4, 7 and 8 aforesaid together with 200 rounds of ammunition per sample weapon. This stock of ammunition may be renewed under trader's license twice a year on the personal guarantee of the trader that it is not for sale but merely ' practise ' ammunition. Rule 16.—The Warehouse Superintendent shall have power to frame rules for the charge and collection of Warehouse charges not exceeding 2 per cent per mensem ad valorem on all arms and ammunition or parts thereof stored in the Arms Warehouse and for the discharge of such obligations, when over one month in arrears, by the appropriation to the State of an equivalent portion of the offending goods. Rule 17.—The Warehouse Superintendent shall frame rules to be approved by me regulating the transfer between traders of arms, ammunition or parts thereof stored in the Arms Warehouse except (1) that no such transfer shall be valid without the consent of the traders concerned; (2) that it shall be reduced to writing and subject to the certificate of the Warehouse Superin tendent, to be confirmed by me that all charges leviable under these rules have been fully paid; (3) that it shall be duly registered by the Warehouse Superintendent; and (4) that the fees to be charged for the registration ot any such transfer shall not exceed Rs. 10 for each such transfer. ■■ m M i \TORM D. license TO WITHDRAW AB.MS, AMMUNITION OR PARTS THEREOF FROM THE ARMS 'WAREHOUSE, MASKAT.

The instructions in your No. 1842 dated the 4th November 1916 being to dispose of the matter under Section i 27 of the New Order in Council I went into the case and came I to the same decision as my predecessor that there was no ' evidence of any judicial value whatever '. Indeed , except hearsay, there is no evidence at all and as far as can be seen any evidence vwhich could be obtained v/ould be tainted and hardly sufficient for conviction, I accordingly did not pro- ~ce d further with the matter;' I trust that No. 5626 dated 531st October 1916 from the Chief Political Officer to your i address did not mean that it was considered that the evidence was sufficient to convict, I only read it that the section was ■ ' sufficient to cover the offence. 1 * On account of the close connection of the Sultan v/ith the affair I would personally deprecate any action in a case which, I would respectfully submit, it would be extremely difficult to prove, which would, to the public eye, appear to bring us into opposition with His Highness and in afoi 'I which if we failed to bring off the result we desired we should if appear to have be n over reached while if we did succeed wouldfcn make us appear to be giving a public snub to His Highness. Were the Sjultan definitely proved by private enquiry to be implicated it appears to me to outweigh the importance of the Hindu concerned and would necessitate a private and grave remonstrance addressed to His Highness. The:A The of.se If -crue, and I have no doubt truth under- -lies the statement made, shows that all the offenders have received indirect punishment, and it would in the circumstance appear more important to tfike measures for the future than to press further in the matTier for the present. As you art aware I- have been going carefully into the subject of the Arms Traffic which still exists end am submitting suggestions to you. With reference to the framing of New King^s Regul^ I have in this, as in other matters for which there was no tamediate, urgency, preferred to give myself a few months to understand more fully the circumstances of this place before putting in suggestions which might be the result of thought but half matured. I have new completed three months in Muscat and feci myself more competent to form opinions of value and am accordingly putting on paper the results which will shortly be despatched to you.

Memorandum « 1111M I I Ml ^Please refer to correspondence ending with your telegram ?To.l013 dated 9th February 1917, on the subject of possible amendment of the Mao oat order in Council. The history of the matter is briefly as follows;- On 7th October 1916 Major Howell pointed out that the Order in Council provides no means of p/ianishing a British subject for infringement of the Sultan's Arras Warehouse Regulations. He forwarded a draft King^ Regulation under Article 80 of the Order in Council, imposing on British subjects a penalty of imprisonment for a term which may extend to throe years, or fine, for any breach of His Highness 1 rules. On Slst October 1916 you telegraphed that the particular case then ponding could be decided under Article 27 of the Order in 'Council, directed Major Haworth to deal with thatjcase on its merits, and pointed out that the question of applying the sultan's rules by King's Re gulation could be considered lator. -i On S5th January 1918 Major Haworth forwarded, with his AI letter No.214, copy of which is attached, a draft King's Regulation, conferring upon the political Resident the general power to declare any act to bo a breach of a 're cognised local law or cu3tom ,, , and imposing the same penalty as that suggested by Major Howell for a breach of such law| fT f - or custom. As the matter did not appear urgent, I poat^SCj ponad comment on It until i could dlscuaB It with Political* Agent Muscat. I was myself under the impression that the provisions of Articles 87 and 88 of the order in Council would meet the vast mjorlty of oases, and that the pub- Uoation of a special King's Regulation speoifloally apply ing the Arms Warehouse Rules would merely draw attention to the fact that other foreign subjects were not liable to any specific penalty tor a breach of the rules, without any counterbalancing advantage. Major Haworth, however, lays considerable stress on the fact that Articles 27 &amp; 26 wculd only apply to the actual lmpo»terB, while the mere possession of arms, contrary to rule 2 of the Gultan 9 s rules, could not be punished. This is a good point; at the same time I consider that the above objection to the pub lication of a specific King's Regulation has great force. Major Haworth 1 s draft King's Regulation is free from this objectionj at the same time it is very sweeping in its scope and I think the law officers would take the view that if so general a power is to bo conferred upon the political Re sident its proper place is in the body of the Order in Council and it could hardly be properly conferred by Re gulation. There would seom to be no objection to the power in itself, which is Impliedly contained in the vague pro visions of Article 82. That Article is sweeping enough as regards the Political Resident's powers of interpretation, but is silent as to the means by which those powers are to be translated into action. In my opinion, the best solution of the difficulty would be an amendment of Article 82, as in the draft attached. If you consider that such an amend ment has little chance of being taken up at present, I would recommend that the whole matter should be dropped,and that we should rely on the deportation sections to enable us to deal drastically with any case of improper possession arms on a scale indicating an intention to traffic in them: The question of abetment is covered by Section 109 Indian penal Code read with Section 4 (o) Criminal procedure Code. * j f y'''\ although thora would Appear to ho a legal difficulty in^ ^ volved in the conflicting definitions of the word 'offence' in the Indian Penal Code and criminal Procedure Code. .in tha toi' . -'f (section 40 )&gt; an offence is defined as 'a thing made punishable hy the Code itself, or a special il or local law as therein defined. And a local law is de fined as 'a 1awapp1icable only to a particular part of British India **. In the Criminal procedure Code, on the other hand, an offence is defined as •'an act or omission made punishable by any law for the time being in force*. I imagine that there would be no legal objection to the use of the second definition to make punishable the abet ment of an act made punishable by a law in force in Muscat.

In deciding on the issue of this Regulation arainst the r^coamenda11 on of the Deputy Political 0 Vide Bushire Fero.942,July 15th,191S.: Resident, I have been actuated by the following considerations:- (1) An amendment to the erder in Council involves a reference to the Secretary of State for India, Foreign Office, and Privy Council which under present circumstances it is desirable to avoid unless absolutely necessary.

Sir, ' V 4 jv I have the honour to refer to Memorandum Ho, 27602 hi - ' 'J i dated 4th December 1918 from the Officiating Civil Commission £ -er Baghdad to your address on the subject of an urgent Musca Order in Council to which you referred in your telegram Ho. V 1759 dated 26th December 1913. Forwarded under cover of this letter from the Officiating Civil Commissioner was a copy of letter Ho. 656-E.A. dated loth Ho vember 1918 from the Foreign Depart- -ment, '^ara 2 of this letter does not take notice of the reasons which I gave in my Ho. ^14 dated 25th January 1918 1. For making no special mention of the Arms Traffic, 2. For the extension of the order beyond the I jcl limitations ofxArms Traffic question. I will accordingly quote these. I stated * Since however neither this order in Council nor the Arms Warehouse Rules contemplate the abetment of an C- offence and the order in Council does not mention the offenc^ of being in guilty possession of smuggled property some extension would appear to be^ required. On the other hand if an order were published by which the Arms Warehouse Rules were extended to British Subjects then the subjects of Foreign powers in treaty with iHis Highness the Sultan would ^ o in a position to argue that ymti until the same course were _ 1011 owed with reference to them they would not be subject .o the Rules in question. We might equally/ be brought into friction with powers not in treaty with His Highij ness concerning offences c omit ted by their subjects. j Thv. necessary power co deal with this question could be given under Section 31 and 82 of the order but with reference to section 32 there appears to be no method other than personal influence or political prestige , by which the Political Agent can carry out the enforcing of the customs referred to therein while with reference to Article 31 there appears to be no penalty named in any treaty or in the order in Council. There would appear to be no method of punishing a British oubject in Oman for the infringement of any local law or ' ^ for any ol fence against the Sultan or his authority or that of hisiofficials. I would then suggest that in place of framing a King* ^ ■ | Regulation which would deal with the infringement of rules in * connection with the Arms Warehouse a Regulation should be made wh HI which would deal with all the points above-mentioned and which mim would at the same time would include offences in connection with arms and ammuni ti on.' Since writing the above I have had practical proof a. of the necessity of,general regulation of the nature and I was on that occasion obliged to fine some local and Charbar merchants by making them subscribe Rs 1500/- to the Bed Cross Pund,since I could find no section under which I could proceed otherwise# If however,in spite of what I have stated above,it is considered that definite allusion should be made to the Arms . ki, (rreLr ^ , i Traffic I would suggest that^ af ter the words ' recognised local law or custom in Muscat ' should be added ' or against the Arms Warehouse Rules of the sultan of Muscat# ' I think however for the reasons I have given it would be a mistake to create a special King 's Regulation dealing f 5 1with the Arras Traffic alone. I further Bee no reason to make a special reference to any one or other of the rules and regulations published by His Highness to which we have given our assent# I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Major ' political Agent and H.B.M's Consul, Muscat.No. Cjfr of 1919.

To The Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, 4 Baghdad# Memorandum« Your nenorandun No»^7^0S of D^'Cenber 4*01 last on the subject of the Muscat K.R # 1 of 1018. ♦ I ?rorward herevirith a copy of a letter containing the views of the Political Agent Muscat on the question. I think the following points are beyond dispute; f - (a) It is extremely necessary for the Political Agent to have power to punish infringements of the Arms Warehouse Rules by i- . ' ' British subjects. (b) It is most undesirable, by the publication, by itself, of a special Arms Warehouse Regulation, to thrust unon the notice of foreign subjects the fact that they are not at present liable to any punishment for the infringement of these Rules. The Arms Traffic is at present dead, but the nresent circums- tances are altogether exceptional, and in view of the enormous i ^ profit to be made, it is not to be expected that when trade is one3 more freed from war restrictions, atteirrots will not be made to revive it. (c) article 82 of fhe Order really lays down the nrincinle to which the present K.R. gives force and effect. The gravamen of the objection taken by the Government of India to the K.R. as published is that the acts to oe penal z 5d are not clearly set out, andjit would, no doubt, be possible, though in the highast degree improbable, Tor the Political Resi r le?it to penalize an act done without orininal intent, by declaring it ex post factfl to have been a breach, o: a recognized law or customouetonv To avoid this drawback, I suggest that the K.R. night be amended, the vrords 'rooognised local law or custom' being renlaoed by the words 'duly promulgated Jooal law or regulation of Hie Highness the Sultan of Muscat'. This phrase would naturally include the Arms Hegulations, and the objection of lack of olearnesa would be done away with, inasmuch as it is sur^^y the duty o, a foreigner, resident in any country / to inform himself ot its laws as duly pronulgated.

Herniation 2 is a rood precedent for a Kind 's Herniation in ranoral torma as Mr .Win•ate surreated in his letter. I think however the reason that His Majesty 's Government approved this and other Herulat ions in reneral terms is that Kinr 's Heru^at icna are only meant to apply to such offences which can be disposed of sumarlly by a punishment of less than ? months imprisonment or moderate fine. This is shewn by fact that both the Order ir G6uncil 1667 in Article 4 and the Muscat Order in Council 1915 Article 79(2) limit the imprisonment to 3 months an pointed out by Political Arent, Muscat. In the circumstances the draft new Kinr's Herulat ion submitted to Government appears to be ultra vires, and.1 -'r? and as a ouniahn^nt of nora than 3 months nay b« and probably would b« r*qvir *.x for offenoaa oonn«ot«d with the Arms Braffiy I pr d 3um^ you will con^W it usolsoato issue any relation with tha npocxfic object of d^alinf with Arms Traffic oases: xhds^ 1 t-fiiiih could b« d^alt with uinder Articles 2? ^ ^8 c 1 ' jnj liuso&lt;4t ' c ' r:l#r in Council 1915 coupled with tb* Gsction J. 09 , Indian Pinal Code and Section 4(0 ) # Indian Criminal Uod# which ar^ put in force in Muscat by th# Ord^r in Gounttil 1915, as su^reot&amp;d by the lata Mr.Bill in his mtmorandum Bo. P42 datel July 15th 1919. As both the two codes are In force xm i think that the definition of offenc© fivan in t^e Criminal i-rooedut'e Col® could reasonably be hold to ba the proper definition for use xt Muscat. It ni/eht however be advisable to rive the Political Arent pov^rs to deal with offences arainst lowal l-iw and G us ton by Kind's Regulation, if this is permissible (Article 8^). If this is done snail offences urHer the Arms Traffic Herulation could be dealt/ with under it. A second Kind's Hejrulation mirht perhaps be made to deal with offences arainst the Sultan or his authority or that of his Officials, waich Major Haworth thought could not &gt;e dealt v/ith (vile antepenultimate pararraph of his letter No.214 dated the 25th January 1919). I am not absolutely certain however if this is possible und^r the Order as I have only the fil« here and not the actual final Order in Gouncil, If you think Kind's Rerulations enforcinr punishments for varue offerees mentioned in Articles Zl and 8S are feasible, and, if so, you afree that they are desirably I will submit draft in consultation with the Political Arent, Muscat.

Any reasonable custom existing in Muscat is any duly promulgated local law or regulation of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat or any local law or custom which if not promulgated shall be affirmed by His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to be ID UK . generally accepted and recognised throughout his territories, i l r unless the observance of such local law or regulation by a British subject should be incompatible with any express or t . specific provisions contained in the Muscat Order in Council 1915. 2, • The observance of any such local law or regulation will be made binding upon British subjects by the Political Agent with the approval of the Political Resident by due notification under this regulation. % ] Any British subject contravening any local law or regula tion duly notified under this regulation may on conviction be punished with fine and imprisonment as prescribed in Article - 79 of the Muscat Order in Council 1915• 4. Regulation Ho.l of 1918 is hereby repealed. y ^ *************** V fls 3Copy of a letter U o.40 dated 8th Hovember 1984 from HlV Majesty 's Political Reaident in the Persian Gulf and Consul General for rars etc., to His Majesty's Prinoipal Secretary of State for tforeiisn Affairs, foreign office, London. i, I in Jj. jUe^ te^ I hLive tha honour to inv i 11 j m' *i i &gt;6 a rexerenoe to Despatch no, 309 dated 27th June 1924, x'roiu His Majesty^ CharAffairs, Tehran, oo your aclaress on tne suj .jsot of instructions res-oe^t- ing the isbue ol Lvin&gt;5 o Regulations, &amp;o., under Orders in Gcunoil. 2, In ao^crdan^e with Mr Ovey s su^^estion I had taken in hand the preparation of Draft Memoranda oi instructions not only for ; r the Persian ^oast and Islands Order in Gouriwil but also for the Bahrain Order in Jounoil and the Muscat Order in Qounoil, when I received from you, under cover of your Despatch Ho.

Qo wv, MuSC/tf. UrLsvt I /vuJ'C*. _ -.During my visit to Dhofar amongst many other topics that ijaiyid oaia discussed with, me was the insanitary and foreiorn appearance of his principal towns, i.e. Muscat and kattrah. ^s he pathetically, but rightly, said of the former it has tixe appearance oi a town that has been heavily shelled a ileet and then fleet has left it and gone away*'1 ^seeb ciearly that the existing state of atfairs not only is sa^^mg the health of liis subjects but is having a very bad effect on the general prosperity of his chief port towns. Xi e tells me tnat he is most anxious to improve matters and that it is one of the things he wants to take up on his return to muscat, ne states however tnat one of his chief obstacles is in dealing with the large population of British subjects ana the property they own, mostly in a delapidated condition, in both Muscat and mattrah. 4. -'-e is perfectly right in this assertion as, imagining themselves perfectly immune from any local laws and regulations, the ibritish subject population ta.tce no trouble to either maintain their property properly or to keep it in a sanitary condition. m this connection i issued a notice in August last so that any steps now taken are well within the law. 5. i thinK in the terms of Sec. 133 C.i'.C,, read with the 'Muscat order in Council, 1915', i have sufficient pov/ers to adequately cope with tne situation and to co-operate with mini ii the Sultan in advancing his schemes, as ne said, i can The Hon'ble -Lieutenant-Colonel a. .iJ.i?'owle, C.B.K. , / rolitical riesident in the Persian uuli , Bushire.quite easily deal with my own aibjects and would welcome \ k, i^j your co-operation and help in dealing with the British subject j.art of the populace'. The first thing to do is obviously to get trie place surveyed. A ground survey in the rabbit warrens and lanes constituting jLuscat or .kattrah would taice years and then be useless, but enlarged aerial mosaics would certainly go far to serve the problem and would be adequate enough for all practical purposes. 7. The next thing, and this His Highness is very keen on, is to obtain the loan of the services ^free of course) of a competent British engineer officer to study the problem of draining the fearful cesspool to trie south of the town muscat;, and tnereafter to Keep this area free. 8. This latter point involves the disposal of rain water. why not construct storage tanks which would be an invaluable reserve against the annual water shortage in the hot weather. 9. Saiyid Said jumped at my idea of converting the open space adjoining the cesspool into a decent little public garden, which can be very easily done at trifling expense. The said area is at present a repugnant anc odoriferous eyesore only rivalled by its neighbour the cesspool. 10. The Sultan, who has been busy planning, planting and reorganising in Dhofar, is undoubtedly fired with zeal to do the same in muscat and i think his ideas are worthy of our support. 11. xo sum up requirements to further his ideas, the following are essential:- -an aerial survey of kuscat and plater if not nowj jkattrah. ^b; our assistance in dealing with non-co-operating British subjects. if none other is vcj The services of a competent engineer * to survey mailable perhaps the heikh of Bahrain the drainage problem, ighi be induced o ifind to his brother rab Ruler,the services of his municipal Engineer, ^ovided the latter is competent to deal v/ith such matters.9 , +( ' ' /it,:, x thins our assistance in these iratters would oe ■' ffl ost useful politically at this juncture, .f therefore you ^ agree in i-rinci^le can you take steps to arrange for the necessary ingredients? outl - e probleiti 01 sanitary maintenance will nave to oe tao,ciea out at this sta^e it need not be considered . niacn step iiiust be tasen gradually. 14. i should be very grateful for informtion as to your views ana the possibility of assistance to enable me to/pre- pared vviien iSaiyid Said returns.D.O, Wc 35/Bb y) N ' - ) /? i'U-, ^ated Uie Jfr/jfeorauxy 1954.

On quiet rei lection it contains aiany flaws and is not, in r .y opinion, sufficiently wide in scope. ^* - or example, what about people who own property in' Muscat or Katrail but who live in India? There are many, cilx of wnon. woulo. successfully dod^e the law with impunity. Again it seems essential to include something about tiie propex* and sale itaintenance of house property and ouiIdin^s in general. An oiiiission to do so iwill lead to a le ^l evasion of the law and this repair of buildings etc. is one of the main things Ae'are after. Half the promis cuous local 'latrines' and plague bj^ots are to be found in tiie ruins of Bannias and Khojas property. 5* ^o specific mention cf the imposition of conser- vancey or municipal taxes, is made. The Sultan 1 know con templates imposing such taxes and 1 think it only right that our subjects, who dominate both bazaars and a large portion of each town, should pay their share. Do the terms of the proposed order embrace this? I think specific mention is necessary, safeguarding ourselves by saying 'taxes for con servancy and tne upkeep of the municipality in a sanitary and proper condition may be levied from, all British subjects Kon f ble Lieut.

The sanitary conditions prevaij-in^, in the towns of I-.-uscat and latrah can only be described as deplorable. This condition is further intensified by the fact that a considerable amount of house property, godo^ns, walled enclosures etc. owned by British Subjects or British Pro tected Perso/ns has been allowed to fall into a ruined - condition, providing free access to persons desiring to use it for ii.iproper purposes. 3, His Hi^nness the Sultan while most anxious to remedy this regrettable state of affairs, finds it difficult to do so when regulations which he may issue to his own subjects can be ignored by British Subjects or British Pro tected Persons with impunity, nor c&amp;n . i^ose Municipal Taxes on his own subjects when our own contribute nothing to well being and upkeep of the townships, in both of which they own considerable property. s. g. p. i. —247 p.

His Highness the Sultan of Muscat wishes to form a Municipality to undertaice this very necessary duty* &amp;hen X was last in Muscat His Highness represented to me firstly, that under Article 13 of the Muscat Commercial Treaty of 1891 he possessed no jurisdiction to compel British residents, of whom there are a large number at Muscat ~ practically all British Indian, to conform to such local Municipal rules which may be framed, and secondly, that except under a general agreement of the nature described in iirticlti 19 of the same Treaty he could not recover from British residents the taxes required to be imposed tor the financing of the Municipality and that in these circumstances he could scarcely tax his own subjects- 2m ^nis Highness referred to the King's regulation oi 19x1 (see paragraph 3 below)* X explained tactluliy th^t it had never been put into force, and that it was in my opinion unsuitable*(&amp;&gt; - - m \'■ -2- 3« Under King's regulation No.2 of 1911, framed under the Muscat Order in Council, 1867, British subjects and British protected persons residing at Muscat and Mb.ttrah are required to conform to the rules issued by the Muscat Government to its own subjects for the proper conservancy and sanitation of the towns. This Hegulation, however, is, I consider unsuit able in that (a) it is too loosely worded and does not provide for the prior approval of the lolitical Resident to any measures which may be applied by the Muscat uovernment, a precaution which I consider essential and (b) it aoes not provide for the payment of municipal taxes by British subjects, who in my opinion, should not escape such taxation* 4» The question has been discussed between the political Agent and myself and 1 enclose herewith a draft King's Hegula- tion which has been drawn up as a result of our discussions. The following notes are in explanation of the various articles. iarticle 1 repeals the defective Regulation of i9il, Article 2 . This, while permitting the application of local rules and taxes to British subjects, enables the xolitical Resident, who would normally act through the iolitical Agent, to prevent the application of any objectionable measures to British subjects. article 3 . This is necessary since the houses of owners, absent in India, may be in a condi tion dangerous to the public and may need demolition. - If they are insanitary the tenants can be proceeded against under Article 2, but if in a dangerous condition powers must be given to the political Agent to deal with the property itself* article 4. /• - .;••• • - ■ *■■■ /rs' -3- &gt;rticle 4# The provision of a specific punishiaent follows the precedent of the Oraer in Council| e#g.
