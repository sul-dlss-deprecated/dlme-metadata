This Memorandum is intended as a short supplement to the printed departmental Memo randum as to Persian Government Loans dated the 17th October 1910. It is not proposed to summarise the lengthy and often inconclusive correspondence that has taken place since that date regarding the indebtedness of the Persian Government, and projects like that of Messrs oeligman for making them further loans. But when definite results have been attained, a brief description of them is here given, so far as thev have a bearing on Indian interests. -• The position may first be recalled of the Anglo-Indian Loan of 1903 and 1904 as it stood in ctober 1J10. It had then been included in the general amalgamation scheme of the debts of the Imperial Bank of Persia, and its amount, with // r , e oo S i;' l8 ,/ a c , u ! ated on the , 21st March 1910, was IL.v. Id. For a period of three years ie until the 20th March 1913, interest only, at 5 per cent., was to be paid in respect of it, and thereafter redemption of capital and payment of interest were •mo-ai Z? 1 ' t'/ 15 equal annual instalments of | covemi g the period ending the ^Oth March 1928. imP* A ^l 16811011 tllat came up at the end of UK), was that of the remuneration of the Imperial Dank of J ersia for their services in connection with the loan.-- It was decided, after consultation 'I, 1 i , 1( ?®’ ^ iat ^ or ^ ie three years ending the ^ th March 1913, the Bank should retain 1 i&gt;er cent, interest on the sum of 314,2811. 16s 4d and i noQ fol i the P eriod 21st Ma rch 1913—20th March 1J18 they should retain, each year, one-fifth of the interest portion of the annuity of 30,278/. 12s. 7d. A Table of Amortisation of 'the loan, giving the the interest portions of the annuity for each year was prepared here (Appendix I.), and forwarded to the Foreign Office. On its being represented subsequently by the Bank that the sum of 314,281/. 16s. 4d. above- mentioned included a sum of 42,261/. 0s. 9d. for capitalised arrears of interest, they were allowed to retain one-fifth of the latter sum, viz., 8,452/. 4s. 2d during the three years ending the 20th March 191b.4. An important transaction that may next be described was the issue in July 1911 by the Imperial Bank of Persia on behalf of the Persian Government of a public 5 per cent. Sterling Loan of 1,250,000L The Persian Government specially assigned to this loan, subject only to the existing prior charges in respect of the Anglo-Indian Loan,' 1 ' the full net Customs receipts of the Persian Gulf, including those of Bushire, Bunder Abbas, Lingah, Moham merah, and Ahwaz, agreeing at the same time that these receipts should be made payable direct to the Bank. In the event of the Customs receipts being insufficient, the deficiency was to be made good “ from other sources of Government revenue,” and further from the telegraph receipts (subject to a prior charge on those receipts up to 1928 on account of the Anglo-Indian Loan). The loan, which was issued to the public at 9Gi per cent.,! was redeem able at par at any time after 191G after six months’ notice, and a cumulative sinking fund of one-half per cent, was to be provided in respect of it commencing in 191G, and extending over a period not exceeding 50 years. It was stated in the prospectus that “ the annual “ amount required for the service of the loan is for “ interest and for the prior charges until March “ 1913 the sum of 78,214L, and from thence until “ 191G the sum of 92,779Z. Thereafter the annual ” amount required for interest, amortisation and “prior charges is 99,029Z. until 1928 (when the “ prior charges cease), and onwards front that date “ the sum of 68,750Z.” According to the contract with the Persian Government, the Bank were authorised to pay off their own debt out of the proceeds of this loan, and to hold the remainder at the Government’s disposal. The arrangements generally were settled in communication with this Office .and the Foreign Office, and a letter from the Foreign Office (Appendix II.), taking cognisance of the arrange ments and promising a measure of diplomatic support, was embodied in the prospectus. 5. In February 1912 after Mr. Morgan Shuster had left Tehran, the position of affairs in Persia being extremely critical, a proposal was once moref brought forward for a joint Anglo Russian advance to the Persian Government. It was uncertain at first whether its amount would be 400,000?. or 200,000?., and the Secretary of State in Council was prepared to advance from Indian revenues sums of 100,000?. or 50,000?., whichever might be found necessary. Ultimately the amount of the joint advance was fixed at 200,000?., and a cheque for 50,000?., the Indian portion, was sent to the The Persian Government 5 Per Cent. Loan of 1911 (£1,250,000).

Iiiijx iJcil Bank oi J ersia on the 10th February last. 1 he conditions of the advance were laid down in a joint British and Russian Note, dated the 18th February 1912 (Appendix 1IL), and, briefly, were: interest at 7 per cent.,'-' repayment to be out ol the first proceeds of a forthcoming Persian Government loan, and “ until then the surpluses of (&lt; the i^rthern and southern customs'revenues ( u be wholly and respectively assigned to the amortisation of, and to the payment of interest ^ on, the Russian and British portions of the present advance. Ihe conditions were accepted by the Persian Government in a Note dated the 20th March 1912. Later, it was agreed that until the 28th March 1913 interest only should be paid on the advance, without provision for the redemption of capital. G. As regards the Imperial Bank of Persia, it was settled that they should retain as their remuneration one-seventh of the &lt; percent, interest, i.c., 1 per cent, per annum on the loan as before (paragraph 3). 7. As already explained, 50,0001. instead of 100,000/. was advanced out of Indian revenues in February. In a letter dated the 29th April the Secretary of State for India in Council expressed his readiness to advance on the same conditions as before a further sum of 25,000/. For the moment no action w^as taken under this authority, but in the following August, in view of the situation created by the defeat of a force of Persian gendarmerie under Swedish officers, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs caused a sum of 25,0001. to be placed by the Imperial Back of Persia to the credit of His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran and applied for the refund of a moiety (12,5001.) from this Office. 1 his was sanctioned, the amount being paid to the Bank of England, on account of the Foreign Office, on the 21th August. The conditions as regards interest and repayment w^ere the same as in the case of the previous Anglo-Indian advance of 100 , 0001 . It may be explained that of the 25,0001. received by His Majesty’s Minister, 10,0001. wa?re advanced to the Persian Government soon after its receipt by him, and that he instructed the Bank at Tehran on the 24th October last to pay the remainder into the account of the Persian Treasurer-General, making it clear that the money was to be used for the gendarmerie in Southern Persia. 8. In compliance with a request from the Foreign Office for a further Anglo-Indian advance to the Persian Government of 15,0001., for the use of the Governor-General at Shiraz, the Secretary of State in Council, in a letter dated the 21st November 1912, consented to provide the Indian moiety (7,5001.), the ad vance to be in all respects on the same footing as the previous /Anglo-Indian advance of 25,0001.4 The Accountant-General of this Office paid the sum of 7,500?. to the Imperial Bank ot Persia to the credit of His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran on the 27th November 1912. Pol. 4552/12. The unexhausted balance of the sum of 100,000?., which the Secretary of State in Council expressed himsell *in February last (see paragraph 5 above) as ready to advance to the Persian Government from Indian revenues is now MO,000?., (i.e., 100,000?., less 50,000?. + 12,500?. + 7,500?.) 9. Thus the debts of the Persian Government Total debt of the Persian Govern- to His Majesty’s Government are to-day (2 November 1912)* as follows:— .£ s. (1) Anglo-Indian Loan of 1903 and 1904 (5 per cent.) - 314,281 1G (2) Anglo-Indian Advance of February 1912 (7 per cent.) - 100,000 0 (3) Anglo-Indian Ad\ance of August 1912 (7 percent.) - 25,000 0 (4) Anglo-Indian Advance of November 1912 (7 per cent.) 15,000 0 Total - - £454,281 16 tP ment to His Majesty’s Govennment. (£454,282.) j * The advance of November being treated as already in the hands of the Persian Government. 4 0 0 0 4 Interest only on these sums has at present to be paid, but, unless the arrangements agreed on are modified, redemption of capital should begin in the case of (1) from the 21st March 1913, and in the case of (2), (3) and (4) from the 29th March 1913. If a huge loan be issued hereafter for the Persian Government, the advances of February, August and November should be repaid out of the proceeds. There have been various projects for such a loan, and M. SazonotT discussed it on his recent visits to London and Paris : the proposal that is now under consideration is that it should be arranged by the Societe d'Etudes of the Trans-Persian Railway, if the financial position in Persia should be found to justify it. Another proposal also has recently been mooted Slr E - Grey s Telegram to Sir G. for arranging a loan of smaller amount under Euchanan &gt; No- l^-b^l3th^N°vember 1912. British and Russian auspices. 10. In conclusion it may be noted as a point of detail that a proposal has recently been approved after consultation with this Office to arrange for the simultaneous payment each month of the sums due from the Persian Government in respect of the Anglo-Indian Loan of 1903 and 1904, the public 5 per cent. Loan of 1911, and the recent advances made by His Majesty’s Government. Simultaneous monthly payments in respect of various Loans. Sir E. Grey’s Despatch to Sir W.

Joint Note addressed to the Persian Government by the British and Russian Ministers at Tehran on 18th February 1912. (Translation.) Animated by the desire to place upon a solid basis of friendship and confidence the relations between the Government of His Britannic Majesty, the Imperial Government of Russia, and the Imperial Government of Persia, and desirous of assisting the Persian Government as far as possible in their task of re-establishing and maintaining order and tranquillity in the countiv, the Russian and British 1 negations have the honour, by instruction of their Governments, to make to the Persian Government the following proposals :— 1. The two Governments are prepared, in order to meet urgent expenditure, to advance to the Persian Government a sum of 100,000Z. each. Ihe imperial Bank and the Banque d Eseompte will each open an account for this sum as soon as the two legations have received a favourable reply to the present note, and it is understood that the sum paid into the account by the Banque d’Escompte will be placed at the disposal of the Persian Government in roubles, amounting to the sum of 945,750 roubles. 2. The above-mentioned sums will be lent at a rate of interest of 7 per cent, per annum, and will lie repayable out of the first proceeds of the forthcoming loan of the 1 ersian Government, and until then the surpluses of the northern and southern customs revenues, which have hitherto been placed by the two Banks at the disposal of the Persian Government, will be wholly and respectively assigned to the amortisation of and to the payment of interest on the Russian and British portions of the present advance. 3. The advance will be expended under the control of the Treasurer- General, in accordance with a programme prepared by him in agreement with the Cabinet and appioved by the two legations. It is understood that a considerable part will be assigned to the organisation of the Government gendarmerie with the assistance of the Swedish officers. In making this pioposal, and in older to attain the ends indicated at the beginning of this note, the two legations hope that the Persian Government will undertake (1) to conform their policy henceforth with the principles of the Amdo- Russian Convention of 1907 ; (2) as soon as Mohamed Ali Shah and Salar-etl-Dowleh have left Persia, to dismiss the fedais and irregular forces now in the Persian service; (3) to discuss with the two legations a scheme for the organisation of a small regular and effective army ; (4) to come to an agreement with Mohamed Ali Shah on the subject of his departure from Persia, of his pension, and of a general amnesty to his followers. Hoping to receive a favourable reply, we avail, &amp;c. G. Barclay.
