Most of the notices are signed by the British Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Charles Dalrymple Belgrave.The notices cover a wide range of issues pertaining to the day-to-day running of the government, including taxation of various types (pilgrims, cars, boats, radios), immigration and passports, import restrictions, quarantine fees, and property rights. Some notices allude to the impact of the Second World War upon Bahrain and its inhabitants, namely the rationing of foodstuffs (folio 33), black market goods (folio 35), and paper shortages (folio 26).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Proclamations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000241#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000241#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
