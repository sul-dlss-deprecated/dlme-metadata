Most letters pertain to the charting of possible routes for the proposed railway in relation to British interests vis-Ã -vis the Russian Empire. Interests are variously defined as either the effects of railway construction on military mobilisation or commercial and trade interests.Correspondence on the railway is mainly between the Government of India, Whitehall, and the Inter-Departmental Committee on the proposed Trans-Persian Railway, as well as the Political Resident in Bushire, and Political Agent in Kuwait. Reports from the Inter-Departmental Committee consider a variety of factors such as weather, trade balances of various cities, construction costs, and Russian influence in making recommendations on possible routes. Population statistics and the financial potential of various markets for British goods at various Central Asian and Persian ports, towns and cities are also noted in the reports.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul, Khorramshahr</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of the Russian Empire</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Railway construction</topic></subject><subject><topic>Balance of trade</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000112#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
