From a family that long lived in Qurna, she describes her father’s stone and mud home where she lived as a child, and recalls daily life then: children’s play, spending time and sharing food with neighbors, and how the day would end at sunset with dinnertime and then sleep. Ghalia recollects women’s responsibility for the household, including carrying water in pots on the top of their heads (before water was transported in barrels by donkey carts), taking care of livestock and other animals (which slept in the houses with the people), and preparing food.  Shopping, she said, was done in Luxor before stalls were set up in Qurna, Despite these duties women had freedom to go out of their homes for visiting and socializing, she says. Aspects of family life in Qurna are covered, such as weddings (with singers, drums, dancers hired by wealthy families), her moving into her in-laws’ home upon getting married, and childbirth and female circumcision. Herbal medicine coexisted with medical care from doctors, and she recalls spiritual practices like people visiting the shrine of Sheikh Abdel Qurna at the top of the hillside to seek blessings for the sick and women getting ready for marriage. Ghalia tells of her husband’s work with the local government council and her children’s work in tourism, the main source of income for young people and children; she says this income disappeared as the tourists who used to visit the Qurna hillside do not visit the places where residents were resettled. Ghalia recalls the sad day of the relocation, the demolishing of houses, and the situation of those who refused to leave and were eventually forced out, and speaks of the kinds of compensation offered by the government and the apartments where the people were resettled. While admitting that water and sanitation is better in the new apartments, Ghalia misses the greater safety and security as well as communal life and harmony of the hillside, and relates the problems that have beset her and her family since the move.</dc:description><dc:language>Arabic</dc:language><dc:coverage>Al Qurnah, Egypt</dc:coverage><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>Qurna Hillside Oral History Project; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
