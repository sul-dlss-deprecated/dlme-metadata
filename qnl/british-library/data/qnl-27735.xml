I have just received from this Company through the United Overseas Petroleum Company Limited, for pass ing on to you, the enclosed revised and new Orifice Meter Data Sheets R-9, R-18, R-24, R-25, R-26, R-29 (revised), R-37, R-38 (new) for insertion in your abovementioned Manual. The Company inform me that the new royalty meter £-37 measures the field gas coming into the Refinery Fuel Gas System, and R-38 the field gas to the Engine Fuel Gas System. These two meters are for the purpose of measuring the amounts of field gas used in the Refinery on which roy alty deductions cannot be claimed. It should be noted that the calculations involved in these revisions and additions have been made using coefficients given in the M Orifice Meter Data Book' of this Company. Later chart coefficients have been used because of improved metering practice giving small refinements over those shown in the Royalty Manual. Presently the Royalty Manual is being revised to take advantage of the latest avail able information, and revised issues will soon be forv;arded to all interested parties. Would you kindly acknowledge receipt of the enclosed Sheets in due course? F.A.K.Harrison £sq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.

The production figures for the, corresponding months in th^s period have been added to the abstract in peniil. In contrast with the varying monthly output in the first half of 1938 the figures for the second half of 1946 seem to indicate that a steady rise in production is now being maintained.

Since then it has been observed that the flow has been consistently so low as always to be measured by this auxiliary meter, the original meter virtually being inoperative. In view of this it has been decided to remove the aux iliary meter R-23A from service and revise the orifice plate for R-23. Accordingly the orifice data sheet for R-23A is cancelled and should be removed from your Royalty Metering Manuals and a copy of the revised sheet for R-23 is attached for insertion into your Books Nos. 14, 17, 18 and 19.

Dear Sirs: Our letter dated July 27, 194'2, enclosed copies of page 56-A for the Royalty Gas Metering Manual. This page covered meter R-3A which is a 20 inch meter now in stalled in parallel with the 100 inch R-3 meter. We said we would inform you when the Cracking Units came into op eration so that the 20 inch meter would no longer be required. The Cracking Units are now operating and the gas production is off the scale of the 20 inch meter, so the 100 inch meter is ^again in use. We do not pow plan to remove the 20 inch meter, however, unless it is required elsewhere. Whenever the gas production drops within the range of the 20 inch meter it will be used as the official meter. Charts will at all times be kept on the 100 inch meter. If it should become necessary, for any reason, to remove the 20 inch meter, and then, later, to reinstall it, we will so inform you. Yours very truly.

This letter has come in rather oppor tunely. It gives you some idea of how the Mainland oil as handled in Bahrain, a point which came up in the dis cussion I had at the India Office on Tuesday last. Enclosed also is a copy of each of the two Charts accompanying the letter PA 200. Yours s: % It 7THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM CO. , LTD. , A W A L I, BAHREIN ISLAND, PERSIAN GULP. 200: March 21st, 1939. His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, Manama, Bahrein Island. Dear Sir, ROYALTY ACCOUNTING IN RELATION TO ARABIAN CRUDE OIL. Would you kindly refer to our letter No,PAA20 of September 17th, 1938, with which were forwarded copies of a memorandum outlining the procedure to he followed in the importation of Arabian crude oil received at Zellaq and the principles to be adopted insofar as the importation and refining of such oil might affect royalty accounting in respect to Bahrein crude oil. We have been advised that in the near future the California Arabian Standard Oil Company will complete their new oil terminal at Has Tanura. Thereafter, in addition to the Zellaq deliveries described in our letter No.PA-420, deliveries of Arabian crude oil may also be made to us by tanker and received at Sitra terminal. It is the purpose of this letter to outline the manner in which this oil so received will be handled and taken into account so far as Bahrein royalty problems are concerned. Measurement: One of the large tanks at Sitra terminal, probably No. 903, will be reserved exclusively for Arabian crude oil, One of the 12” submarine lines from the Sitra pump house to the wharf will also be devoted to the handling of Arabian crude except on occasions when it may be necessary/* 2 necessary to use the line for the shipment of fuel oil as explained more fully below. Before each receipt of Arabian crude oil, the pipe line from the ship making the delivery to tank No. 903 will be properly isolated by blinds or seals, or both, and the outlet of the receiving tank closed and sealed. A low gauge will be taken in the tank before discharging, and a high gauge at the completion of discharging. Thus the exact amount of oil delivered on each occasion will be measured and converted to volume at 60°P. in the usual way. Occasionally it will be necessary to use the 12” line ordinarily devoted to Arabian crude oil for the shipment of fuel oil. Following such use, the fuel oil left in the line will be displaced by Arabian crude oil from tank No. 903, except that in order safely to avoid contamination of the fuel oil system with crude oil it will be necessary to stop the line wash short of a complete displacement. This may leave up to 500 barrels of fuel oil in the pipe line. The inclusion of a minor amount of fuel oil in the pipe line will not affect the accuracy of the volumetric measurement of the amount of Arabian crude oil delivered in the succeeding shipment. The gravity of the oil in the tank, however, will be slightly affected and on such occasions the ship’s cargo will be sampled in order to ascertain the exact gravity of the oil received for the purpose of converting the corrected volume of the delivery to tons. Calculations in Bahrein Royalty Accounting: After shipments of Arabian crude oil are received and measured, the oil will be pumped from tank No. 903 to Refinery/Refinery crude feed tanks Nos. 131 and 132, where it will be commingled with oil being delivered from royalty measuring tanks Nos. 152 and 153. The principles of determining the amounts of Bahrein oil used in the Company^ operations and deductible in the royalty account, will be identical with those outlined in the memorandum forwarded with our letter No. FA-420, except that Arabian crude oil received at Sitra will have to be taken into account. These principles, accordingly modified, are repeated below: (a) A record will be kept and certified of all oil used directly or indirectly in the refining of commingled Bahrein and Arabian crude oil and in the transporting and handling of such commingled crude oil and its products within the Sheikh’s territories. A deduction will be made of the total quantity of oil soused except the proportion thereof used in connection with the handling and refining of Arabian oil. Such proportion shall be determined by the ratio which the sum of the total quantity of Arabian crude oil measured and run at Zellaq plus the total quantity of Arabian crude oil delivered into Sitra tank No. 903 bears to the sum of the total runs from the royalty measuring tanks Nos. 152 and 153 plus the said deliveries into Sitra tank No.903. (b) Oil used as fuel in handling Arabian crude oil at Zellaq and Sitra and in transporting the same from Zellaq to the juncture with the Bahrein gathering system and from Sitra to tanks 131 and 132 will not be deductible. (c) Oil used in operations not in any way connected with the refining of Arabian crude oil, such as oil used directly and solely in connection with the production handling and transportation of Bahrein crude itself, will be deductible in full as heretofore. For the convenience of those concerned, we are sending with this letter illustrative charts of the facilities which are being and will be used for the reception and handling of Arabian crude oil. These charts are referred to as Nos.BR- 628-1 and BR-696. Would/Would yoube so kind as to convey copies of these charts and the information contained in this letter to the Bahrein Government and let us know at your convenience whether any further information is desired or whether they are now in a position formally to signify their approval of the procedures outlined here and in our previous communication referred to above.

The amount of Bahrein crude oil run from field storage on which the gross royalty payable to the Sheikh of Bahrein will be calculated will be determined by certified runs of the oomlngled crude oil from royalty measuring tanks Nos. 152 and 153, with a deduction of the exact amount of Arabian crude oil measured and run from the Zellaq tanks 0 since the measured quantity of Arabian crude oil deliver ed out of Zellaq tanks will enter into the calculations only in connection with runs from royalty measuring tanks Nose 152 and 153, all crude oil at any time remaining in the Company 9 s field storage and pipe lines, including the line from the Zellaq tanks to the juncture with the Bahrein gathering system, will be regarded as Bahrein oil*6 . I&amp;esl a ' 2443 1939 The Bahrein Petroleum Company- Ltd, # may dattueTTTOB—^ the gross quantity of crude oil run from field storage the quantity of oil used in its operations other than the oil used in connection with the refining of imported oil. The Bahrein and Arabian crude oils are very similar in character and under any given refinery treatment the quantity of oil used as fuel will vary directly with the quantity of crude oil being treated 0 Hence it may be assumed that the total oil so used will be made up of Bahrein and Arabian oils in proportions based upon the respective quantities of each handled. This is also true with respect to oil used in trans~ porting the oomingled crude oil and the products there from. Therefore the following principles will govern deductions in the Bahrein royalty accounts for oil used in operations; - a) A record will be kept and certified of all oil used directly or indirectly in the refining of the oomingled crude oil and in transporting and handling such oil and its products within the Sheikh’s territories. A deduction will be made of the total quantity of oil so used except the proportion thereof used in connection with the refining of Arabian oll 9 such proportion to be determined by the ratio which the total quantity of Arabian crude oil measured and run at Zellnq bears to total runs from royalty measuring tanks ?Tos. 15S and 153. b) Oil used as fuel in handling Arabian crude oil at Zellaq and in transporting the same from Zellaq to the juncture with the Bahrein gathering system will not be deductible. o) Oil used in operations not in any way connected with the refining of Arabian crude oil, such as oil used directly and solely in connection with the production, handling and transportation of Bahrein crude oil itself, will be deductible in full as heretofore.

'Tis' 4r M ^ u/ 7 . 7 y In reply to your letter (P»2, 5544/ 58) of 20th May about the royalty arrangements of the Bahrein Petroleum Company and the refining of Hasa oil at Bahrein, we have examined the documents sent to you by Mr. Ballantyne, which cover the ^ A* SC*.*i**»^ arrangements for assessing the quantities of oil which are used at the refinery for processing purposes and also for certain miscellaneous purposes connected with the Company’s operations, and on which royalty is not payable. General^speaking these arrangements seem to have been carefully worked out on paper; but what really matters is the manner in which effect is given to the scheme in practice. Naturally with so many exceptions the question of watching over the arrangements becomes more important. But I recognise that this is a matter for the Sheikh and his advisers. When, in 1954, we concurred in the arrangements for measuring the Bahrein crude oil for royalty purposes we felt J. P. Gibson, Esq., India Office, S.W. 1. ti J*T l - 7 i JUL 1938 INDIA OFFICE■I that it was desirable to have an independent opinion on the methods which it was proposed to use (see Redwoods 1 letter of 5th November, 1934, and my letter to Laithwaite of 3rd December, 1934). The Sheikh has the power to appoint a representative to v/atch over his interests and presumably this is not being lost sight of. So far as the Hasa crude oil is concerned there should be no great difficulty in applying the arrangements proposed, for assessing the quantities of oil products used at the refinery when treating Bahrein crude, to Hasa crude, so as to ensure that any Bahrein oil used to treat Hasa crude is not exempted from royalty payment. Unless the two crude oils are of similar quality the calculations would only be approximate. For the time being the proportion of Hasa crude to the total crude refined will presumably be small. If later on it should assume larger proportions it may be desirable to go more exactly into the matter. Apparently the Company intend to submit a memorandum of their proposals for dealing with these matters in relation to Hasa crude and if they do we shall be glad to look at it.

More valuable than any yet found in the Middle East. Already of great importance in the petroleum market because of very low cost of production r the Island of Bahrein in the Persian Gulf seems about to assume new and greater importance by reason of drilling results in a horizon about 2,000 feet below the produ cing horizon opened several years ago* All indications are (says the ’’Petroleum Times”) that another large commercial horizon exists underneath, and the first drilled on a drill stem test produced 250 barrels per day of 60 to 65 A.P.I. gravity crude, mostly con densate, and about 18,000,000 cubic feet of saturated gas at 1,900 to 2,0003b. pressure* This oil, of course, being almost gasoline, is far more v aluable than any yet found in the Near or Middle East, and if furtherdrilling proves that there is a large field, it means that the present strategic position of the Bahrein Petroleum Company, Ltd (Standard of California and Texas Company) is further strengthened. It will place this group in an unassailable competitive situation in the e vent of any oil war in the markets East of Suez. The Company’s 25,000 barrel per day refinery will be placed on full stream this month, and part has/-=====000====: f J has been in operation for solfle^tTGie “past^ The present depth of this discovery well - No.52 - is 4,535 ft., and it has been continued through the new producing zone from 4,150 ft., slightly less oil and gas being found in the lower part of the section. Very high pressures were met during the testing stages. Because thegas is wet, further quantities would make it economical to erect a natural-gasoline plant for the production of blending spirit. The discovery well in the upper zone came in during June, 1932, at a depth of 2,008 ft., and to date 11,000 acres have proved productive, thereb eing 50 wells with 3,000 ft., spacing. The fact of the pipeline to the loading terminus being less than a dozen miles in length, plus the shal low nature of the field, gives Bahrein its low cost pro duction of crude, and the modern refinery on the spot ensures veryeconomical production of refined products, which, as stated, will be enhanced by the latest find. Up to the middle of October twelve million barrels of crude had been produced. Up to the present time only about £ 4,000,000 has been spent, yet the Company possesses what may be considered one of the most profitable oilfields of its size in the Old World, complete with a modern refinery and pipeline to deep water. British workmen and engineers are being employed c as far as possible on the refinery and other operations, and young technical students are being sent to Bahrain and trained. Some 200 permanent British employees have been sent since January, 1936, as well as approximately 300 British workmen, in connection with the refinery erection. There are opportunities for rapid advance ment for employees of the right type. H &amp;!CONFIDENTIAL.

Cpniidential. INDIA OFFICE, 1. 3rd October, 1936. Dear Mr. Ballantyne, You raised the other day the question of the issue of certificates of origin in respect of oil snipments from Bahrein to foreign countries. You said that the idea had been mooted of the Bahrein Company’s employees being appointed honorary Vice-Consuls by certain foreign powers with a view to such certification. I explained (for your confidential information) that His Majesty's Government would certainly not allow any infringement of their treaty rights whereby no representative of any foreign power may be established in Bahrein, and I promised to ask Colonel Fowle for his views on the solution which seemed to me to be the right one, namely that the Political Agent snould issue any certificates which might be required. I have now consulted Colonel Fowle, who agrees that the Political Agent is a suitable authority for issuing certificates of origin (I understand he has already done so on occasions). I believe that Certificates of Origin are frequently issued by the Director of Customs, Bahrein Government, but presumably that is not quite what you require. Yours sincerely, Sgd. M.J.CLAUBOH. K.H.valiantyne, Esq., 11, Birchin Lane, E.C.3.CONFIDENTIAL. p.z. 7000/36 BAHREIN OIL. Mr. Ballantyne called on September 24th and raised two points in connection with the marketing of Bahrein oil. He said that the Company were hoping to market some of their oil in the Phillipine Islands and another part in Indo-China. These were, so far as he knew? the only territories in which difficulties might arise in regard to preferential duties. He understood from his principals in San Franoieco that for oil products going into French or Phillipine territory it would make a difference whether the shipment was from British territory or not since there was in both cases a preferential tariff for British goods. I informed Mr. Ballantyne that for the purpose of section 21 of the Import Duties Act 1932 the Bahrein islands are regarded as ’’territory under His Majesty’s protection” and therefore that Bahrein products imported into this country receive the benefit of the preferential tariff duties applied to Empire goods. Presumably this fact would be accepted by the Phillipine and Indo-Chinese customs authorities as entitling Bahrein Oil to British preferential tariff. Mr. Ballantyne agreed that this was probably so and that he might tackle the matter on those lines. He went on to refer in the same connection to the question how certificates of origin should be obtained for shipments of Bahrein oil which might be imported into foreign territories. His principals in San Francisco had suggested that an arrangement might be made whereby employees of the Bahrein Petroleum Company would be made Honorary Vice-Consuls for e.g. Prance etc., and that in that capacitythey should issue certificates of origin for uae in the countries to which the oil was “being shipped. I informed Mr. Ballantyne that this was quite out of the question as the Sheikh of Bahrein was by treaty debarred from receiving representatives of any Governments other than His Majesty’s Government. His Majesty’s Government would certainly not allow any infringement of their treaty rights in this connection. I that so far as I knew there would be no difficulty in such certificates being issued by the Political Agent and my impression was that this procedure was already normal in Bahrein. I promised to consult Colonel Fowle and/or Mr. Belgrave, and let Mr. Ballantyne know whether my presumption was correct. Mr. Ballantyne agreed that prima facie such an arrangement would be quite suitable. All that was wanted was definite proof of origin for the purposes of the customs authorities mvi the importing country. India Office, 28th September, 1936. M.J. CLAUSON.wmm The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited I, Birchin Lan e, London, e.c.3. r i&gt; y ) 21st September, 1936. I 6850 i Dear Mr. Clauson, Oil Measurement. As I think you might like to have them for your information, I send herewitl*the following:-COPY THE BAHREIN PETROLiUM COMPANY LIMITED * 11, Birchin Lane London, E.C.3. 17th September 1936. ■1 !956 j Dear Belgrave I send you herewith a Note I have received from Hamilton on the existing temporary system of measurement. You will see it is, in effect, the old Sitrah system plus measurement of the crude oil going from the field into the Refinery through the medium of two tanks specially used for the purpose. Instead of measuring the oil as it is taken out of the storage or measuring tanks, the oil is measured when it goes into the tanks. Each tank, both at Sitrah and at the Refinery, which is used for royalty purposes, must have a valve in the pipe leading into the tank and another valve in the pipe leading out of the tank. Alien the oil goes into one tank, the valve is sealed by the Governmait and the Company can then do what it likes with the oil that is in that tank. Regarding the refined products which are used, you will see that it is, as I thought, quite likely that this is what Steele means when he talks about 'cuts'. 'Cuts', I understand, is a very loose phrase and may mean quite a lot of things in the Refinery World. Suffice it to say that for the present purposes careful measurements are being taken and will be taken during the transition stage of all the products (that is refined products) used by the Company, for which- 2 - the Company will ask an allowance in terms of crude oil. These measurements will permit the Company and the Coverrment hereafter to determine what that quantity of crude oil is. You will see the five tanks referred to on the office sketch of the lay-out, which is also herewith. You might return this sketch when you are finished with it: there is no hurry about it. I enclose also a duplicate of this letter to you and also an additional copy of Hamilton's Note to me: you may like to have them for Fowle or someone else. Yours sincerely, (Sgd) H. H. BAXLANTYNE. C. Dalrymple Belgrave Esq., c/o Junior Army &amp; Navy Club, Horse Guards Avenue, S.W.l. Enclosure Delivery.6, Lothbury, London, E.C.2. 17th September 1936. Mr.H.R.Ballantyne, 11, Birchin Lane, E*C • 3* Dear Mr. Ballantyne, Pending the completion of the refinery and other installation at Bahrein which will include a simplified procedure for measuring oil for royalty purposes, the present method temporarily in use is relatively simple. At the moment there are five measuring tanks - the three at Sitra built son© time ago and two additional tanks recently constructed close to the Refinery. Those five measuring tanks are indicated on the attached sketch which eventually I would like to have returned, but I am in no hurry about it. The crude oil line from the Field runs to these five measuring tanks. During the period of filling any one or two of these measuring tanks, the others are closed off from the Field line. A low gauge is taken prior to running oil into the tank from the Field, and when the run to that tank has been couple ted, a high gauge is token. The difference between these two gauges represents of course the amount of crude oil put into the tank. The Coupany is then free to run the oil from that tank to the Refinery, to ship the oil or otherwise dispose of it. In order to make provision for allowances for Refinery products used in the Company’s operations, the Company is measuring such products as used from tanks at the Refinery, and records are being kept sufficiently complete to permit the conversion of refinery products or 'cuts' from the crude oil to tons of crude oil, on any basis that may later be determined. Within certain limits the proportion of any refined product distilled from the crude, can be adjusted by a 'cut' at such temperature as may pro- -duce the kind of product desired, and hence it is common to refer to these products as 'cuts'. Yours faithfully, (Sgd) L. N. HAMILTON.THE BAHREINPETJROLEDM COMPANY LIMITED, 11, Birchin Lane, London, E«C*3. l^th ^apteraber, 1936• •ar Be lg re ire. oil tenmxrmmt* 1 hope my latter to you of ye»U rday ’s data on the subject of temporary mseaurameat of oil for royalty purpoaaa made the natter clear to you. If there la any further lofometlon you require, please do not hesitate to aek me questlone. X think 1 should follow up that letter elth another one record ing ahortly the informetion X gave to you on Thursday last as to the plana of the Company to measure oil for royalty purposes when the Befln» •ry system has been completed. Therefore *- After co aldering the matter of royalty ganging at Bahrein oyer the peat six months, during the course of which the Tlews of the various members of the Producing, Manufacturing and Ganarnl inglnssring Depart ments of the Company have been obtained and considered, toe Company has coma to the conclusion that the o&gt;ly safe and practical way to account for royalty measuraaiaats la to iastal at least two large tanka which will receive the crude oil from the fields and which will he mead only for royalty gauging purposes. In addition, the Bahrein Oovarnment will ha aakad to gauge theseveral anall refinery fuel, dieeel end gasoline tanka which, I understand, will be used to store oil required in the operations of the Company. ( £he two large tanks to receive the crude oil will each hare a capacity of 134,OoO barrels end wil3 require four to seven days to fill, assuming a crude production rate of 50, KX) end 20,0 0 barrel* per day res pectively. ^hsn s tank is full the Bahrein Government’* iiepreeentatiye will be called upon to gauge and after the eve liable crude has been pumped from the tank he will again be required to gauge, thus keeping the gauging at tha n outage baeia which has been the practice et Sitrah. This apparently means that official gauges by the Bahrain Govern ment dcpreeentetlve will be required but once ersry two or three deye both opening and closing gauges; depending upon the production rate. The crude oil will be pumped from the gauging tanks to refinery crude tanka at a rate of 3,000 barrels per hour - approximately Iwo days to empty a tank - and to ^itrah at 1,500 barrels per hour. ^ith these pumping facilities one tank will always be available for the Producing Department to draw upon without disturbing the production rate at the field. Rile latter point la apparently of great importance to producing arcac. Ac X read it, the foregoing plan of operation means that there will be one pipe from the field *•** *• lnt0 *** walla will rum) which will branch off into thoaa two crude oil mccwaring tanka. The flow of oil into each tank will in aech case be operated by means of a valve which can be seeled and with which you are familiar from your knowledgeBEtiie operation of tJ-v Taivea at oitrah* i'hero will bo two pi poo running •way from the tanke in which there will mXmo be ▼ olwoo which can be opened and closed and controlled by the Bahrein Goverxxaant. fha maaeuroment will operated. actually take place when the outlet waive la to be/ ^here the crude oil goee to after it leevea the tneaeuriag tanke need not concern the Bahrein Gknremx&amp;ant for royalty purposes* Ae to the areall tanka containing refined products, it will be necessary to eatlmata in tunas of crude oil, the various products used in the operations of the Company* Bow this will be done I have not explained to you in detail and cannot do so at the mosant. Z await further inforaa- tlon on the subject. It is not, nowev. r, a natter of pressing Importanca so far as the future Is concerned. Those small tanka will have to be measured in the aeae way as the large tanks holding the crude oil. There may be othor points on the field et which oil is taken for the Company’s operations, such ae for roads. 1 think it has bean the pract ice for some crude oil to be taken from gathering stations on the field and afterwards accounted for by the Company to the Government• 1 understand there ere detailed measurements of oil collected and used at all points. This la, 1 think, a minor detail Z need not go into at tha moment. My objective now la to give you seme idea of the main principles of tha present *temporary) and proposed future vpermanent/ ayaterns for measur ing crude oil for royalty. I am hoping to receive shortly now a plan of the fields shewing the efinery lay-out, which will include these tanke 1 have referred to withri (Hece ived under Bahrain itinted letter i;o• C/o7 j- lO/l of 7th August 1936).
