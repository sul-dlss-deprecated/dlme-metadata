(1) Letter from the First Assistant Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 1906, dated the 17th June 1908, and enclosures. (2) Letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 2020, dated the 30th June 1908. (3) Letter from the First Assistant Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 2119, dated the 7th July 1908, and enclosures. My Lord, With reference to Your Lordship’s telegram, dated the 20 th November 1907 , we have the honour to forward, for the information of His Majesty’s Government, copies of the correspondence cited in the margin re garding the rights of the Sheikhs of Koweit over the islands of Bubiyan and Warba. 2 . As regards Bubiyan island, the evidence which the Political Agent at Koweit has now collected shows that until the recent establishment there of a post by the Turkish authorities, the island had been in the exclusive occu pation of the ^ Awazim tribe, who have exercised for generations hereditary fishing rights in virtue of grants made by the Sheikhs of Koweit and that the authority of the Sheikhs to make such grants has hitherto never been disputed. These facts confirm the^view as to the Sheikh’s claim to the island of Bubiyan which we put forward in paragraph 5 of our Secret despatch No. 25 (External), dated the 4 th February IQOL ^'t 'vii re S a . r ^ s coast line from Um Kasr to Sabiya, in the absence of rc ^ I i a “* e 1 evidence that the Ahmed bin Eizk, who is alleged by Sheikh Mubarak to have built the old fort and dug the Um Kasr wells, was a Koweit subject, the Sheikh’s claim rests on the existence of old settlements founded by Koweit subjects on the ^western bank of the Khor Sabiya and on the fact that the coast fine is actually in the occupation of Koweit Arabs who recognise the authority of the Sheikh alone. We doubt whether the Sheikh’s title can bo considered as fully established by these considerations. 4 . _ The evidence as regards Warba island is, in our opinion, by no means conclusive. The Sheikh claims the island, which has apparently never been occupied, merely on geographical considerations, as the private proprietor, under a deed of settlement, of the opposite coast line from Eao to Khor Zubeir. 5 . So far, therefore, as Warba island and the Um Kasr-Sabiya coast are concerned, His Majesty’s Government will probably prefer to await the result of the further enquiries which Major Cox has directed before taking active steps to assert the Sheikh’s claims. As regards the Bubiyan island, we shall be glad to be informed whether His Majesty’s Government contemplate addressing the Turkish Government in the matter, or whether they desire that a favourable opportunity should be taken to assist the Sheikh to establish hisI authority. At present it would appear that the Sheikh is not anxious to move in the matter, and, although we attach the greatest importance to the assertion of the Sheikh’s rights in Bubiyan at an early date, we would not advise the location of a Koweit post on the island unless we could count on the hearty co-operation of the Sheikh.

With reference to paragraph 2 of your Endorsement No. 1424-E.B., dated No. 295 , dated 9 h June 1908 . 20th April 1908, I have the honour to forward herewith a report from the Political Agent, Koweit, on the ownership of the Islands of Bubiyan and Warba. Owing to the absence of the Resident at Shira?, the report has not yet been seen by him. It is therefore possible that he may desire to submit some remarks on it later. No. 295, dated Koweit, the 9th June 1908 (Confidential). From—M ajor S. G. Knox, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To— Major P. Z. Cox, I. A., C.I.E , Resident and His Britannic Majesty's Consul- General in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to_ acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 1598, dated 26th IVlay 1908, inviting my attention to Foreign Department telegram N°' S.-532, dated 21st of November 1907, and requesting the expedition of the report called for therein regarding Warba island. 2. I would first express my extreme regret at the delay that has taken place in submitting the report on this important, question. It was seldom during the cold weather that Sheikh Mubarak and myself were together in Koweit, and since I returned from tour in the beginning of March, Sheikh Mubarak has been so occupied in marriage festivities that it has been difficult to persuade him to attend to business. 3. I was, at first, inclined to throw on Sheikh Mubarak the onus of pro. ducing proof of his ownership of the island and he undertook verbally to do so, but copies of recent correspondence between us, forwarded herewith, will show how completely he fails to understand the nature of the proof that is required to establish his ownership successfully. 4. I was therefore compelled to request the Sheikh as will be seen from the correspondence, to send me Awazim witnesses and hold an informal enquiry myself. The result of this enquiry—the depositions in English and vernacular are forwarded herewith—has been to furnish clear evidence as to the ownership of Bubiyan island and there is, therefore, room for congratulation in that, so far, the enquiry has not been barren of results. I may be permitted to record here the very favourable impression I formed of the Awazim witnesses. Their evidence was clear and to the point and obviously untutored. I think a mere perusal of their statements will convince a disinterested observer of this fact. No one with any regard to truth will be able to deny that an ancient grant of fishing rights was accorded to the Awazim fishermen by Sheikh Mubarak’s great-grandfather and that his order has been universally respected to the present day. I hope shortly to obtain 'written evidence that these rights are capable of inheritance and transfer and that the forum which habitually deals with such cases is the old Shar’a Court of Koweit, in which the hereditary Kazi is of the Atsani family and which depends for the execution of its decrees on the executive action of the Sheikhs of Koweit. This will go far to establish the ancient ownership of the Sheikhs of Koweit in Bubiyan island and the unwarranted encroachment of the Turkish authorities in establishing, in spite of remonstrances, a post there, flanked on all sea sides, by the Awazim properties. 5. The proof of ownership of Warba island will have to depend on other considerations and we are here on weaker ground. The Awazim evidence isclear and uncompromising that the island has never been of any use to anybody and no rights of ownership would appear to have ever been exercised there. It would seem therefore to depend mainly on geographical considerations and the question may be posed thus : “ Is Warba an offshoot of Bubiyan and does there fore the ownership of Warba island follow that of Bubiyan ? ” or “ Is Warba an offshoot of the mainland and does the ownership pertain to whoever can establish his claim to the mainland?” Sheikh Mubarak maintains that the mainland swamp between Fao and the Khor Zubair is his property, but in his capacity of Turkish subject, paying revenues to the Turkish Government. The Sheikh states that there is incontrovertible proof of this fact in the deed of settlement between himself and the sons of his murdered brethren, in which the boundaries are clearly laid down to be, to the south and west, the sea, the Khor Abdulla, and the creek. This creek he contends to be the Khor Zubair, explored in 1907 by a survey party from R.I.M.S. Investigator. The Sheikh declares that there is no other creek between Fao and Khor Zubair and, however this may be, and I am inclined to doubt it, the mention of Khor Abdulla would go far to support his contention that the creek in question lies far to the westward. Bubiyan island on the other hand would appear to be as clearly the property of the Sheikhs of Koweit under God, as one of the Awazim witnesses quaintly put it. There remains the coast line from Umm Gasar to Sabiya. Sheikh Mubarak lays claim to Umm Gasar on the ground that the old fort, marked on the charts, was erected by one Ahmed bin Rizk in the time of his grandfather, Jabir as Subah, and that the original name of the place is Bahaith, that the name of the place was changed by the Bedouin to Umm Gasar by the fact of the erection of the fort—the term fort is perhaps rather a misnomer, as any hut is termed Gasar by the Bedouin—in the time of his ancestor by the same Ahmed bin Rizk who was undoubtedly a Koweit subject, and whose descendants still live in his house here in Koweit. It was this same Ahmed bin Rizk who dug the Umm Gasar wells. Another proof to which Sheikh Mubarak attaches importance is the presence of an island, called Jazirat as Suf or Wool island, immediately opposite Umm Gasar, where the Koweit Bedouins used to wash their wool for market. The Turkish erection of a fort at Umm Gasar was an encroachment that has never, so far as I am aware, been acquiesced in by the British Government and is still a grievance with Sheikh Mubarak. From Umm Gasar down the coast I can myself testify without hesitation to the fact that the land is regarded as the grazing ground of the Koweit Arabs and that Sheikh Mubarak’s will throughout the region is law. 6. To sum up, I venture to record the opinion that Sheikh Mubarak’s claim to the ownership of Warba island is a very strong one, and that the general considerations recorded above are worthy of credit and could be established with little trouble. I regard the private ownership of Warba island as undoubtedly vested in Sheikh Mubarak as, on the north private proprietor of the coast line, proved so by deeds recorded in a Turkish court of law. The proofs to the ownership of Umm Gasar would have to be examined and the considerations advanced by Sheikh Mubarak will undoubtedly have great weight, as will also his afe/acA? occupation of the western bank of the Khor Sabiya, as evidenced by the old settlements of Araihjiya, Hogaija and Sabiya, the numerous wells dug by Koweit Araibdar and the actual status quo i as evidenced by the grazing rights of Koweit Araibdar and the Sheikh’s authority throughout this tract. The analogy of Bubiyan, which I regard as undoubtedly Koweit property and at least as independent of Turkish control as Koweit itself, will have great weight in deciding the ownership of Warba island and the only point that admits of doubt is the extent to which Sheikh Mubarak’s right of ownership may be limited by Turkish sovereignty.Examination of witnesses in enquiry (confidential) re ownership of Warba island. 1.

From later enquiries as to Ahmed bin Rizq who is alleged to have dug the wells and built a fort at Umm Gasar, I find that such evidence as I have been able to obtain will make it extremely difficult to prove the man in question to be anything but a Turkish subject. He appears to have been a native of Nejd and to have led a wandering life, eventually retiring from business as a pearl merchant to Girdilan close to Basrah. Another Ahmed bin Rizq, deceased, has a grandson living, also named Ahmed, a fellah of Sheikh Mubarak’s at Fao but who served in the Turkish army. It is not an easy matter to get certain evidence on these points but should further definte information be obtained by me, it will at once be forwarded and no effort will be spared to procure it.

Sir: - I am directed by Secretary Sir E.Grey to acknow ledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo, in which you furnish the observations of the Secre tary of State for India on the report of the recent Inter-departmental Committee on the Bagdad Railway terminus. In reply, I am to express Sir E. Grey's concur rence in Mr. Morley's view that the recent acquisition of the foreshore at Bunder Shweikh, with the right of priority of lease of the foreshore in the direction of Ras Kathama, adequately secures the position of His Majesty's Government if Koweit is finally select ed as the terminus. As regards Warba Roads, which lie between the is lands of Bubiyan and Warba, I am to state that Sir E. Grey e Under Secretary of State, India Office. /—-Grey entirely concurs that it would he desirable to assert any rights which the Sheikh of Koweit may poss ess in respect of Warba Island, though he is of opin ion that, even if it were not possible to substantiate those claims, the Sheikh’s jurisdiction over Bubiyan should be resolutely supported by His Majesty's Gov ernment on the grounds so forcibly stated by the Gov ernment of India in paragraph 5 of their secret let ter of the 4th February, 1904. The views of the Gov ernment of India on this subject are confirmed by the report of the recent Inter-departmental Committee. Sir E.Grey considers, however, that in the first instance it is desirable to ascertain the nature of the Sheikh's claims to Warba Island; and, in view of the inclusion of that island amongst the localities to which, in virtue of the Agreement of October 15th, His Majesty's Government have secured prior rights of lease, I am to suggest, for the consideration of Mr. Secretary Morley, that no useful purpose can now be served by delay in addressing the necessary en quiries to Sheikh Mubarek. WhenWhen the nature of these claims has heen inves tigated, it will then he time to determine what fur ther action should he taken| I am, however to add that in view of all the circumstances Sir E.Grey is dis posed to recommend that the most effective and conve nient manner of asserting the Sheikh's claims would he to permit in due course the quiet establishment of a Koweiti post on the northern coast of Buhiyan Is land or on Warha Island, as circumstances may render advisable. With regard to the final paragraph of your let ter, I am to state that Sir E.Grey's observations on this subject will be contained in a further let- &lt;! 2 ' ter which will be addressed to you from this Depart- T 4 - ment in reply to your letter of the 6th instant res pecting the flagstaff on Telegraph Island and the general policy of His Majesty’s Government in the Per sian Gulf. £J t-ll 0 Departments are requested, if they suspect that there ip any ifiistake in this telegram, to communicate immediately until the Private Secretary to the J’arliatnentnry Under Secretary of State.

Sir, In accordance with the instructions convey ed in your telegram No. 2l'§g E. B. dated 5th instant^ I have consulted Shaikh Muharak and now have the honour to report the result. (2) I n the first place the Shaikh stated that the idea of his maintaining a post on Bubiyan an*Island commended itself to him very much, but that he could not venture to carry out the proposal if he had to take upon himself the undivided onus, or odium, which such a movfe would involve. He continued that he had already suffered so much from the retaliative amenities of thethe Turks, alike in connection with; (i) The imprisonment of his Agent. (ii) The arrest of his friends. (iii) Interference with his Fao property, and the murder of his employe's, that he naturally hesitated to give them any excuse for further reprisals. If, on the other hand, it was quite understood, as I assured him I believed to he the case, that the British Government were prepared to inform the Porte that they recognised his claim to Bubiyan, and were advising him to institute, or supporting him in instituting, a posu or posts onJ^ the Island, then, he said that he ^ Shaikh Mubarak, was only too glad to carry out the project. (3) Asked what form and amount of assistance he would require from Government, he replied; (a) That we should maintain a Political Agent at Koweit (i.e. as a practical permanency) who would give him support and advice. (b) That Government should occasionally send a man-of- war to Koweit, and up the Khor Abdulla. (c) That Government should, if there was no objection, bear the cost of the erection of guards' quarters, ( 1Nl,l r«n» , tt* / / ill* (estimated at ^?500/-) and their maintenance per mensem). (4) At this juncture I produced the chart, and dis cussed with the Shaikh the strength and position of the post. As to strength, he expressed the opinion that 10 men would he mifficient for one guard, and at any rate not more than 20. As to position - He strongly advocated three block houses, not one only. ( At this point I beg reference to the 'Sphii^'s' survey of the Khor Abdulla). Shaikh Mubarak considered the most important position on Bubiyan to be the most easterly point of Rasal Geit, apparently about l£ miles U. E. of the present 't Turkish (Storehouse'. He regards this as stratigical- ly the most desirable site, because the Khor Sabiya not being navigable on an ebb tide all craft proceed ing in the direction of Zobeir, must pass up the Khor Abdulla, and a post at Ras-Ai-Geit will be palpable to all. The second post, he agrees, might be on the most North Eastern point of Bubiyan, south of the Eastern ex tremity of ^rba^siand, whi^he also claims to be his.The third position, to which he also attaches special practical importance, would he the Jeziret-es-Soof or '■Wool Island', one of the islands in the creek almost due E. of Urakasr Post, and prohahly the Island shown A on the top Margin of the 'Sphinx' survey. Shaikh Mubarak declares that to this Island especially his claim cannot be disputed, for it has been used from time immemorial and still is, as a depot for wool under export from the hinterland, and that all the wool merchaa ts ifrom Koweit proceed there regularly at certain seasons. I informed the Shaikh here, that I had only been in structed to discuss Bubiyan with him and, in that con nection, one post on the H. E. of the Island, to balance t_Jhe Turkish posts at Umkasr and Al Geit- He begged me, however, to communicate his complete views to Govern ment* (5) As a matter of faet, instead of threatening to support Shaikh Mubarak in maintaining a post at the N. E. end of Bubiyan to balance the two Turkish posts, would it not be possible, and at the same time more logical and more effective, to threaten them with a block house apposite Al Geit and another opposite Um- ^asr, on Soof Island, to balance their two posts ?In this latter connection I asked Shaikh Muharak wheth#V the location of the Turkish and Koweit posts, within j range of sight and rifle shot of one another, would not lead to friction. He replied that this would not he in the least likely, for, as it was, the Turkish guards at the two existing posts were constantly so much on their heam ends that they were frequently dependent on his people for the necessaries of life; and this would always he the case. (6) In the concluding sentence of the Foreign Depart ment Telegram under reply, I gaifcher that my views are asked especially as to; (i) The support which it would he necessary for us to give Muharak. (ii) The complete reservation of the right to send an Agent to Koweit from time to time. with regard (i) Shaikh Muharak did not make the slight -est hint to mejin the direction of a subsidy, and I imagine that he suggested our defraying the small estimated cost of erection and maintenance (i.e. IP 500 /- for building and SR^lOO/- per mensem for the up keep of eaceh post), more because the payment would give Government a direct interest in the project, than that the refhnd of the money ^object to him. Muharak has however suggested on one or two previousr l~9 previous occasions that a subsidy would be acceptable to him, and if the present proposals taken shape, per haps the occasions would be considered a suitable one for starting such a subsidy. With reference to (ii) Shaikh Mubarak, as I har.e men tioned above, stated, without hesitation, as the first condition on v/hich the undertaking could be put in hand, that the British Government shpuls keep an Agent permanently at Koweit. Apart from this, I venture to state, that when reading the opening words of the Secretary of States telegram in the present connection -tar. the first thought^struck me was that it seemed a pity that the opening of negotiations with regard to Bu- biyan should be admitted in any way, as between us and the Turkish Government, to hinge on the temporary absence or withdrawl of our Agent from Koweit. But possibly I have misinterpreted the sentence and H.M's Government have no such intention, (7) In conclusion I beg to observe that it is diffi cult for me to advise satisfactorily as to the best position for a post, or posts, without acquainting myself roughly with the features of the ground, on the spot; and it also seems important that the 'Jeziret- es-Soof' mentioned in paragraph ( 4 ) above should be%J/7' With reference to my letter of April 19th I am directed, hy the Marquess of Lansdowne to enclose for the information of the Secretary of State for India copies of despatches from His Majesty's Ambassador 'Jpof Constantinople respecting the Turkish military post on Bubian island. / Sir N. O'Conor expresses his apprehension vide 4th paragraph of his despatch No.248 of April 17th) that the Turkish Government might propose a 'bargain' by which, in return for the evacuation of Bubian island by the Turkish soldiers His Majesty's Government would consent to withdraw their agent permanently from Koweit. Upon this point I am to observe that, should the proposal be made, it ought in Lord Lansdowne's opinion certainly not to be ac cepted. He adheres to the opinion conveyed in ray letter h e Under Secretary of State, India Office.latter of December 16th, 1904 that these questions must he kept separate and distinct in any discus sions with the Ihrkish Government and that His Maj esty's Government must reserve absolutely the right to despatch an Agent from time to time to Koweit. With a view however to obviating the eventu ality which His Excellency fears, it might be desir able that any further representation to the Porte a. ; ’v. should be postponed until Major Knox has been tem porarily withdravvn from Koweit wliich will, it is understood, be almost immediately. Lord Lansdowne would propose that Sir N. 0’Conor should then again approach the Turkish Gov ernment and ask whether the soldiers have been withdrawn from Bubian Island. Should the answer (... '■ JC&amp;&amp;' ■■ -w prove unsatisfactory Major Knox might be sent back to Koweit and might subsequently arrange for the establishment of a post on the Island by the Sheikh. It would be a matter for consideration at what stage Sir N. O'Conor should announce to the Porte the in tentionsintentions of His Majesty’s Government in this res pect and this might perhaps he left to His Excel lency's discretion. I am to add however that His Lordship would wish to have more definite information as to the nature of the support which it would he necessary to afford the Sheikh for the establishment of the post in question. It will he seen that Sir N. O'Conor anticipates considerable difficulty in inducing the Sheikh to take this step. I am Sir Your most obedient humble Servantcopy.

On ray side I thought it best not to make fresh representations at all events at present about the guard-house fearing that if I did so they might pro pose a bargain and suggest that we should withdraw our Resident and they the soldiers. I do not think this would suit us and I should be sorry to see His Majesty's Government renounce their right to send a Resident to Koweit as in the existing condition of affairs some outward sign of our predominant position at Koweit seems highly desirable. But apart from these considerations and suppos ing that the Porte did not make such a proposal I thought that rry representations would fail to have effect unless His Majesty's Government were resolved t either to induce the Sheikh of Koweit to establish a military station at the jDther end of the island, a step which, taking into account the shifty charac- ter and double dealings of His Highness, might re quire considerable persuasion, or to insist upon the removal of the Turks.I venture to think that while the Turkish mili tary station is maintained on Buhian Island we can propeily realise to give any definite assurances respecting the presence of a British Resident at Kov/eit and tnau even if Major Knox be now withdrawn in accordance with Your Lordship's assurances to Musurus Pasha he should return at an early date. Gradually his appointment will be rega rded by the Turks as a fait accompli and their refusal to with draw their soldiers from Bubian Islam will enable His Majesty's Government to consider whether at some future date it majr not be advisable to check the Ot toman Government by establishing a Kowelt military station on Bubian Island.

Fort William, the 16th March 1905. / „ Sir, A ^ , ,,,^ e , have theJio nour t0 refer t0 onr despatch No. 25 (Secret-External) of 4th I ehruary 1904, and to the subsequent telegraphic correspondence T ^'hh your telegram of 18th May 190 f on the subject of the measures that should be taken to obtain the evacuation of Bubiyan Island by the Turkish troops which are at present stationed there. 2. In that despatch we submitted, for your consideration, the following alternative proposals :— 5 . W That the Porte should be informed that we were unable to recognise eir right to maintain a station on Bubiyan, and should be requested to with- ™ t * ie ; lr troops; while at the same time we should establish a post on behalf ei h Mubarak on the northern end of the island opposite to the southern aneiorage. Me pointed out that he had several boats, and could easily, with small support from us, prevent Turkish troops from crossing the Khor Subbiyeh or channel between Bubiyan and the mainland on the west. (6) Should His Majesty’s Government deem it advisable to spare the u an s susceptibilities by the adoption of a less pronounced course of action, e suggested that our object might be secured by intimating that we regarded u iyan Island as belonging to the Sheikh, and that, unless the Turkish force were withdrawn, we should be constrained to support him in establishing a no rth em shore to balance the Turkish posts at Um Kasr and th • i j ' c °hserved that in this case the Turks would probably retire, and e is and would remain unoccupied. The Sheikh would then resume possession, d i would only remain for us to carry out hereafter such further measures might be necessary for the maintenance of our legitimate interests. 3. Since then, the following action has been taken :— j, D 1 April 1904, His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople suggested to , e ' ar d uess of Lansdowne that he should first remind the Porte of his pre- ious remonstrances against the maintenance of a Turkish military station on if 6 r tb - east corner the island and press for its withdrawal, and that then, ’ a er a lapse of some months, his representations had produced no effect, the cond alternative intimation referred to above should be made to the Turkish government. Mhh May, Sir N. O’Conor was authorised to take action in accordance • 1 . a 1 ? own suggestion, and on 18th May we were informed that, should the m T? 011 rema i n l° r some time without effect, the active measures recom- oaded in our despatch to you of 4th February would be considered further.On 16th May, Sir N. O’Conor reported to Lord Lansdowne the representa tions which he 'had made to the Porte. His Excellency carried out his inten tion of reminding the Minister for Eoreign Affairs of the remarks which he had made in 1902, in regard to the establishment of Turkish military posts at Um Kasr and Bubiyan Island, hut did not, it appears, avail himself of the authorisation which had been given him for making the alternative inti mation originally suggested by us, and practically confined himself to saying that he trusted that the Turkish Government would see the propriety of causing the Turkish soldiers to be withdrawn, and would save him from the “ unpleasant duty of returning to the subject in a more unpleasant form”, as ho would he obliged to do unless the matter were arranged within a short time. 4. Since then no further representation appears to have been made to the Porte until 3rd November, when His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires pointed out that the continued maintenance of the post was looked upon by His Majesty’s Government as an infringement of the status quo, and that the written protest made by His Majesty’s Embassy still remained unanswered. Reference may also he made to the fact that, on 30th December, you informed Lord Ampthill that His Majesty’s Government were unable to accept his suggestion that the removal of the Political Agent at Koweit should be made conditional on the removal of the Turkish post on Buhiyan Island. 5. Nothing has, however, happened since the date of their original recom- mendation to induce the Government of India to depart from their contention ~ as to the importance of obtaining by some means the removal of the Turkish troops. 6. In our previous despatch on the subject we have already furnished you with a full statement of the reasons which have led us to adopt this view; and we need not now do more than point out that the Turkish troops meanwhile remain in the island; that it is evident that the remonstrances made have not been treated with sufficient seriousness by the Turkish Government, who, with the continued postponement of the withdrawal of their troops, are in some degree increasing their presumptive right of dominion over Buhiyan in the eyes of the world in general; and that consequently every additional day of inaction will render it more difficult for His Majesty’s Government to insist ultimately on evacuation. 7. In these circumstances, we have the honour to enquire whether His Majesty’s Government do not consider that the time has now come when His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople might with advantage he provided with definite instructions to make to the Porte the intimation which was authorised in May last, and also whether they will not agree to take into their immediate consideration the advisability of adopting the alternative local measures recommended by us in February 1901, which we still consider to be of urgent importance for the proper protection of British interests in the Persian Gulf. We have the honour to he, Sir, Yqfir most obedient, humble servants, •' ' 1 plOUT WILLIAM. FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. SECRET. External. No 57, BATED THE 16 TH MARCH 1905.

WITH reference to your Lordship’s despatch No. 178 of the 10th instant, I have the honour to report that I reminded the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the remarks I had made to his Excellency in March 1902, as reported to your Lordship in my despatch No. 144 of the 25th March, in regard to the establishment of Turkish military posts at Um Kasr and Bubian Island. I said that, in expressing astonishment and regret at these proceedings, I had distinctly reserved the Sheikh of Koweit’s rights to these places, and had deprecated a disturbance of the status quo. I had hoped that, in consequence of these representations, the Imperial Government would have taken an early opportunity of withdrawing their soldiers from both these places. Two years had elapsed since then, and, according to a report which had lately been received and to which your Lordship had drawn my attention, no steps had apparently been taken in this direction, and it appeared that a military post of some ten men was still maintained on Bubian Island. I trusted, therefore, that his Excellency would see the propriety of causing these soldiers to be withdrawn, and save me from the unpleasant duty of returning to the subject again in a more unpleasant form, which I should be obliged to do unless the matter was arranged within a short time. Tewfik Pasha remarked, in reply, that though the Sheikh of Koweit enjoyed a sort of semi-independence, and had a special understanding with His Majesty’s (iovernment, the limits of his province were very vague, and it was desirable that proofs should be produced showing that Bubian Island belonged to him. The mere fact that Koweit fishermen repaired there annually was in itself no proof of possession or ownership, and if an incident like this justified a claim to possession, there was no saying where his demands would end. I said there was no danger of the Sheikh of Koweit preferring unreasonable claims, and still less of their being supported by His Majesty’s Government if he attempted to do so, but I considered his claim to Bubian was fully justified, and it seemed an undoubted fact that his supremacy and authority in Bubian, which was annually occupied by one of theKoweit tribes, had not been questioned till the Ottoman Government had sent a nnlltary detachment there in 1902. The island was probably of little or no importance pecuniarily, but a denial of His Highness’ authority and rights would be a serious blow to his prestige and influence in Koweit itself, and His Majesty’s Government, who had done so much to preverit his interference in the internecine troubles of those parts, were bound to see that he did not suffer in consequence of their advice and protection. The Minister did not pursue the conversation, and it ended by his saying that he would submit the question in the proper quarter. In replying to the Minister, I evaded as far as possible entering into a discussion as to the Sheikh of Koweit’s rights to Bubian Island, for reasons which I venture to think will be obvious to your Lordship on referring to paragraph 5 of the Government of India’s Secret despatch No. 25 of the 4th February last, of which a copy was inclosed in your Lordship’s despatch No. 107 of the 22nd March. I thought it also advisable, on the grounds stated in my despatch No. 249 of the 5th April last, not to entirely disconnect the question of the evacuation of Um Kasr with that of Bubian Island, and for the further reason that it opens the door to a sort of compromise, which is always agreeable to the Oriental mind, and which may, in this instance, render it easier to obtain satisfaction in regard to Bubian Island.

Ambassador at Constantinople, to whom your Foreign Secret Letter of the Mh February last has been communicated, is of opinion that claim by His Majesty's Government that the island is the property of Sheikh of Foweit will be resented by the Forte as strongly now as it was in 1902 . Me points out that the occupation, on behalf of the Sheikh, of a post on the north of the island would be contrary to the principle of maintaining the status quo on which the representation made to the Forte in 1902 was based (See his Despatch No. 158 , dated the 1 st April 1902 ). He thinks however that it would be possible to press for the withdrawal of the Turkish post from the island, and, after some months' interval, in the event of this representation producing no result, to inform the Forte that we shall be constrained to support Sheikh in establishing a post on the island, unless the Turkish force is withdrawn. He requests, however, that it may be definitely ascertained whether there are any Turkish troops still on the island, and suggests that, if the question is alloioed to lie dormant, the whole force will probably before very long be removed, since the number of troops in occupation has been reduced from twenty to six during the last two years. He also observes that request for evacuation of Bubian without mention being made of JJm Kase will be regarded by the Turks as practical abandonment by His Majesty’s Government of the claim of the Sheikh of Koweit to Urn Kase.

Ivfy Lord:- I have considered with the greatest care the views set forth in the Government of India's des patch Secret of the 4th of February last, a copy of which Your Lordship did me the honour of enclosing in your despatch No.107 of the 22nd of March, while asking me at the same time to state whether I had any reason for thinking that the attitude of the Tur kish Government would he more compliant in present circumstances than in 1902. While desirous to give all due weight to the views of the Government of Indie, which are based up on the Intimate knowledge of the local situation of affairs acquired by the Viceroy of India during his late visit to the Khor Abdulla, I have no hesitation in saying that the Ottoman Government will resent now, quite as much as in 1902, any claim advanced by His i » u The Marquess of Lansdowne, K.G., &amp;c. , &amp;c., &amp;c. HSHHHHHHBHHflBUfiHHHHIHis Majesty's Government to Butlan Island Being the property of the Sheikh of Kowelt.. I do not consider however In face of the know ledge which we have since acquired as to the strate gic and general importance of the position that this need deter us from upholding a claim which I care fully reserved in my language to the Minister for Foreign Affairs reported to Your Lordship in my des patch No.153 of April 1st 1902. I see no serious objection to recurring to the subject and reminding the Minister for Foreign Af fairs of the reservations I made in 1902 with regard to Bubian as v/ell as to Urakasrbut as I then based my remarks on the maintenance of the status quo, of v/hich the occupation of these places was a violation, it would be difficult to use the status quo argument, if the Government of India intended to occupy a port on the Northern end of the island on behalf of Sheikh Mubarak. I can, however, urge the Porte not to lose sight of my previous remarks, and complain of the continued maintenance of a Turkish Military station on nlivyCiA' n) at| ■on the South East corner of the island, end press'for its withdrawal. If after the lapse of some months, it is found that my representations have produced no effect, I would then propose to adopt the alternative course suggested in the Government of India's des patch hy stating to the Porte, that, unless the Tur kish force is withdrawn, we shall be constrained to support the Sheikh in establishing a post on the is land. The fact that the number of Turkish soldiers stationed at the South East corner has gradually been reduced in the course of two years from twenty to six, rather indicates that, if the question be allow ed to lie dormant, the whole force will be removed in all probability before very long, end if so, we would certainly be fully justified in strongly ob jecting to its return and threatening to occupy the Northern shore if it should be established. This, however, leaves the question unsettled for the mo ment and subject to the administrative caprices of the Ottoman Government; it may not therefore be though u advisableadvisable; but in any case it will be well to ascer tain, before I move in the matter, whether the six Turkish soldiers reported as stationed on the island during the winter ere still there. I have only to add that the Porte will not of course fail to notice that the question of Um Kesr and Bubian Island are regarded very differently by His Majesty's Government and they will draw the con clusion that, in pressing for the evacuation of the military Post on the latter while saying nothing about the former, we practically abandon Sheikh Mubarak's claim to Um Kasr. I have &amp;c., (Signed) N.R.O'Conor.Ui I transmit to Your ExceHoney herewith copy of a letter from the India Office forwarding a despatch from the Government of India on the subject of the occupa tion by Turkish military posts of certain positions on the waterway of the Khor Abdulla which are considered to be of great importance in connection with the pro longation of the projected Bagdad Railway to the Per sian Gulf, and of the claims of the Sheikh of Koweit to the districts in which they are situated. The Government of India do not propose to contest the Turkish occupation of the Urn Kasr on the mainland to which, in their opinion, the claims of the Sheikh are not strong; but Your Excellency will observe that in the final paragraph of the despatch it is suggesued that His Majesty's Government shall take suen measures as Excellency The Right Honourable Sir N. O’Conor, G.C.B., G.C.M.G., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. jm\n\ as will procure the withdrawal of Turkish troops from Buhian island with the object of establishing and main taining posts there on behalf of the Sheikh. The proposal is substantially similar to that in regard to which Your Excellency in 1902 expressed an adverse opinion. The grounds on which that opinion was formed are given in your telegram No. 30 of March 11th. 1902 in the 4th. paragraph of which you state 'The Ottoman Government will, I am sure, refuse to evacuate Bubian for any reasons we can at present prefer, and to meet with a rebuff would be unpleasant, while to be obliged to drive them out would be equally so.' The Government of India urge that at the time when this opinion was given the strategic importance of a military post at the northern end of Bubian island had not fully been realised. It may on the other hand be argued that at the present moment the forcible ejection of a Turkish force fromfrom a post on the Coast of the Persian Gulf would be even more inopportune and inconvenient than in 1902. Before further discussing the question I should wish to learn whether Your Excellency has any ground for anticipating that the attitude of the Turkish Gov ernment would be more compliant in present circumstances than you anticipated at the time when your telegram above quoted v/as 'written. I am, &amp;c.

I was, I said, anxious to he able without further delay to assure your Lordship that there was no ground for this rumour, and that the Ottoman Government were firmly resolved to respect the arrangement made with His Majesty’s Government, and to put a stop to all further encroachments upon the territory of the Sheikh of Koweit. His Excellency replied that the Imperial Government had no intention of sending troops to either of the places I had named, and that he authorized me to give vour Lordship assurances to this effect. I remarked that he must not he surprised at my hesitating to convey such assurances to your Lordship, in view of the fact that both Umkasr and Bubian Island were occupied after he had repeatedly assured me that the Ottoman Government would respect the status quo, and that no encroachments would he made upon the Koweit territory. I had already told his Excellency that the occupation of these places could not he regarded as in any way prejudicing the Sheikh’s rights and authority over them, and it was with extreme astonishment that I had subsequently heard a report of an intention to occupy two other localities which were still nearer to Koweit. If the Ottoman Government proceeded in this manner they would very soon bring matters to a crisis, and instead of trying to attain a satisfactory and reliable settlement of this question regarding the Sheikh’s rights by means of friendly negotiation, I should certainly advise His Majesty’s Government not to allow any further encroachments, and to prevent it by force if necessary. Tewfik Pasha said that a report had been presented to the Sultan two days ago stating that the Council of Ministers strongly deprecated any further advance in the direction of Koweit, hut that no answer had yet been received. He was, however, going at once to the Palace, and he hoped to be able to send me word to-morrow that the Sultan authorized the Grand Yizier to send orders to the Vali of Bussorah in the sense desired.

Claim of the Sheikh of Koweit to the island of Bubiyan. Foreign Office Press—No. 343—30-1*04—41.The Right Hon’ble St. JOHN BRODRICK, His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, In his Secret despatch No. 196, dated the 17th December, His Excellency the Viceroy briefly mentioned his recent visit to Koweit and the Khor Abdulla, and the prospects of the shores of this waterway as a future possible railway terminus. 'We now have the honour to address you in greater detail on the subject. 2. It will be within the recollection of His Majesty’s Government that early in 1902 it was reported that the Turks had established a post at the head of the Khor Abdulla. The Commander of H. M. S. “ Sphinx”, who was sent to enquire into the matter, visited the locality between the 14th and the 19th of Eebruary, and reported that, in addition to a position wdiich they had occupied at Um Kasr, the Turks had, for the first time about a fortnight previously, stationed a force of some 20 men on the south-east corner of Bubiyan island. This unwarranted encroachment was at once brought to the notice of your predecessor, reference was made to the importance of the positions seized, and it was proposed by the Viceroy that the Turks should be told that they must at once leave Bubiyan, even if no protest were offered against the occupation of Um Kasr. On the 26th March, Lord George Hamilton telegraphed that it was considered inadvisable to raise irritating discussions about the move ments of Turkish troops to places to which the Sheikh’s title would be difficult to prove, and it was explained that His Majesty’s Government did not wish to obstruct the prolongation of the Baghdad Railway to the Gulf, whether at Koweit or elsewhere. It was added, however, that their assistance would he conditional upon British capital receiving, in respect of construction, materials, and management, at least equal shares with any other Power. In the event, no action was taken to assert the Chief’s claims beyond an intimation to the Porte that their action was regarded as constituting a disturbance of the status quo, and that the occupation of the places in question could not be regarded as in any way prejudicing the Sheikh’s rights and authority over them; and the Turkish posts still remain at Um Kasr and A1 Geit, where they were then established. 3. The importance of the question lies in its relation to the future probable terminus of what is known as the Baghdad Railway. Article I of the Convention, dated the 21st January 1902, between the Turkish Government and the promoters of this enterprise provides that the projected railway shall run from Zobeir to a point on the Persian Gulf to he determined by mutual agreement between the Ottoman Porte and the Company, and there appears to he no doubt that the Turkish advance of 1902 to the shores of Khor Abdulla and the island of Bubiyan was designed to enable the concessionaires to secure, without reference to His Majesty’s Government, what was already recognised by the German Engineers, and has since been generally acknowledged to be, the most suitable terminus on the Gulf. The first section of the line is now,2 ,j \ r Jstfr /f-i i M /v i i'. &gt; i' T su^ oX - (f^ we understand, in course of construction by German enterprise unaided and no arrangements have been made, as far as we are aware, in respect of any portion of the railway from Konia to the Persian Gulf for securing the condition whereby His Majesty’s Government contemplated that equality of treatment should be secured for British capital. 4. During his recent tour in the Gulf the Viceroy personally visited the Khor Abdulla, in company with the Naval Commander-in-Chief on the East Indies Station, and the result of the inspection was to confirm the view which w r e previously entertained of the importance of the Khor and of the superiority of its shores, for the purpose of a railway terminus, over any of the sites in the immediate neighbourhood of Koweit which have previously claimed attention. On board the “ Lawrence”, Their Excellencies passed up the channel to the anchorage below the junction of Khor Zobeir with Khor Um Kasr, and except at the eastern end of Warba Island, where, there is a bar with a depth of two fathoms for a short distance, a depth of four and-a-half fathoms was obtained throughout. The anchorage is some three miles from Um Kasr post, and the banks of the channel are sufficiently high to provide a firm and convenient landing place. To the south of the Warba Island lies the larce sheet of water with plenty of depth and room for an anchorage, to which Bear- Admiral Willes refers in paragraph 50 of his letter No. 209—1171, dated 8th December 1903, to the Secretary to the Admiralty, of which we enclose a copy. Owing to the length of the channel and its capacity for easy land or submarine defences, a port in either of these localities would be absolutely safe from any attack from the seaward. We have already intimated in our Secret despatch No. 16, dated the 21st January 1904, that the remarks of the Naval Commander-in-Chief in paragraph 51 of this letter were written under a misapprehension, and do not accurately represent the political position. It is not necessary here, therefore, to take them into account. 5. In our Secret despatch No. 27 (Frontier), dated the 4th February 1904, we have mentioned the probable antagonism of German interests to our own in this quarter and the attitude which, in our opinion, should be adopted towards the designs of other nations in Turkish Arabia, and we consider that no time should be lost in endeavouring to retrieve so far as may still be possible the position whicu we have so seriously endangered by acquiescence in these encroachments. So far as concerns Um Kasr and the neighbouring mainland, the claims of the Sheikh of Koweit do not appear to have been strong. But whatever may have been their validity, it would be difficult, and we would not now propose to try, to induce the Turks to abandon the occupation which for the past year they have been permitted to maintain. The case of Bubiyan Island we regard as entirely different. Here we consider that the Sheikh has claims which can be sustained alike with better reason, with greater prospect of success, ar.d, owing to its insular position, with smaller risk of subsequent embarrassment * No. 42 , dated the 28 th February 1902 . ^ ourselves. In February 1902, our (Copy sent under cover of the Foreign Secretary’s Political Itesident in the Persian Gulf letter No. 12 m., dated the 20 th March i9 0 2.) reported* that Sheikh Mubarak had addressed to him a written communication in which he advanced his claim to the island, and asserted that the Avazem tribe, who are his subjects, had lived there since the occupation of Koweit for seven months during the summer of each year, and had established fishing enclosures on the island. Colonel Kemball regarded the pretension as valid, and a like view appears to have been held by His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantmoplej who aTew days ^-sir Nicolas o’ Conor to the Marquess of Lans- later telegraphedf to the Marquess of downe. No. as, dated the leth March 1902 . Lansdowne that the Consul at Basrah considered the Sheikh’s claim to the island to be good. Sir Nicolas O’Conor, + sir Nicolas O’Conor to the Marquess of Lana- however, expressed j: the opinion that there dowue. No. 30, dated the 11th March 1902. was n0 0 '| 3 j ec |; j n paising a Conflict about Bubiyan Island while leaving the Turks in possession of Um Kasr. Had the Ambassador then been in possession of the information wdiicli is now available, we believe that he would not have entertained this view. With the shores of the mainland and of Bubiyan Island in the possession of a single Povrer, the anchorages below Um Kasr and at Warba Island can at any time be converted3 into an impregnable harbour: and even if the day is still distant when the banks of the Khor Abdulla are likely to be armed witli foreign forts or batteries the undivided occupation by a German Railway Company of a potentially invulnerable position is not calculated to conduce to the enhancement either of British commercial prosperity or of British political prestige. Supposin'* however, that we are able to make good Sheikh Mubarak’s claims, we at once place ourselves in a position to establish, at the north end of Bubiyan Island, a post which would command not only the anchorage but also the approaches up the Khor Abdulla, and we acquire the power to assert, in such a manner as our paramount interests demand, our right to participate in all arrangements relative to the prospective terminus of the Anatolian Railway. An additional argument, if any is needed, in favour of strengthening our position at Bubiyan may, perhaps, be found in the fact that the Khor is used as a place of refuge by pirates whom the Turkish Government is unable to control and who, as shown in the Administration Report of the Persian Gulf for 1902-03, commit piracies off Bubiyan. 6. His Majesty’s Government have never admitted the Turkish claim to the island, and have, indeed, protested against the interference with the status quo involved in the placing of a post at A1 Geit, where, prior to the month of lebruary 1902, the Turks had never pretended to exercise an authority even of the most shadowy description, and where the total garrison now consists of some 6 men. On the same occasion we were informed by * Telegram of 8th April 1902. £ ord George Hamilton* that the British Government would resist a Turkish ad vance on the Koweit side of Subbiyeh. This place is separated only by a channel from the southern end of Bubiyan Island: and the claims of the Sheikh to both positions seem to us to be of equal validity. 7. The proposal accordingly which we submit for your consideration is that the Porte should now lie informed that we are unable to recognise their right to maintain a station on Bubiyan, and should be requested to withdraw their troops; while at the same time we__skould establish a post on behalf of Sheikh Mubarak on tbe northern end 'of the 'island opposite to tbe southern anchorage. The Sheikh has always urged bis claims to this island, and during the Viceroy’s visit to Koweit he repeatedly asked why the Turks were not compelled to evacuate both Bubiyan and Um Kasr which belonged to him. He has several boats, and could easily with small support from us prevent Turkish troops from crossing the Khor Subbiyeh or channel between Bubiyan and the mainland on the west. Should His Majesty’s Government deem it advisable to spare the Sultan’s susceptibilities by the adoption of a less pronounced course of action, we think it possible that our object might be secured by intimating that we regard Bubiyan Island as belong ing to the Sheikh, and that, unless the Turkish force is withdrawn, we shall be constrained to support him in establishing a post on the northern shore to balance the Turkish posts at Um Kasr and A1 Geit. In this case the Turks would probably retire, and the island wuuld remain unoccupied. The Sheikh would then resume possession, and it would only remain for us to carry out hereafter such further measures as might be necessary for the maintenance of our legitimate interests. We have the honour to be, Sir,1904 . FORT WILLIAM. FOKEIG^s 13 E F* A. Xi T At EIsTT. SECRET. External.

From— Reae-Admieal George L. Atkinson-Willes, Commander-in-Chief, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to forward herewith, for the information of His Excel lency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India, a copy of a letter I have addressed to the Secretary of the Admiralty, giving, for Their Lordships’ infor mation, a short description of places visited by His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India and myself during the recent cruise in the Persian Gulf. No. 209 — 1171 , dated Hyacinth at sea, the 8th December 1903 (Confidential). From—R ear-Admieal George L. Atkinson-Willes, Commander-in-Chief, To—The Secretary to the Admiralty. I have the honour to forward herewith, for the information of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, a short description of places visited by His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India and myself during the cruise in November in the Persian Gulf. [Confidential). I.— Maskat. The cove is small for modern vessels, although it has a good depth of water, and when a northerly wind blows it becomes rough inside, even opposite the coaling sheds in Makalla Bay. 2. The Hyacinth, Argonaut, and Fox were anchored off the mouth of the harbour, Fomone just inside, the E I. M. S. Hardinge inside of her, and Sphinx, Lapwing, and the 11 . I. M. S. Lawrence inside of the Hardinge. 3 . The new vessel belonging to the Sultan of Maskat was there. She is small, more like a yacht than a ship of war, and has not any fighting value, except against dhows, 4 . The army and the forts are of no use except against the neighbouring Arabs, and are not worth taking into account' II.— Mtjsadan Promontory. [a) Kubbat Ghazira [Malcolm Inlet). 5 . Is a fine large harbour, with a great depth of water. There are two coves on the north-east side, which would serve as anchorages, the better of the two appearing to be the one with the village of Eilam at its head. Erom the westerly cove it is easy to climb the ridge of the Maklab Isthmus, and look down upon Elphinstone Inlet. 6. Malcolm Inlet would shelter a large fleet, but it is not suitable as a coaling station, as it would not be easy to defend. Vessels could safely coal in it from colliers, and it would serve as a good temporary anchorage. (6) Kubbat Shabus. 7. Is small, but would afford shelter to small craft. I did not go inside it. (c) Hubat Shisa [Combermere Cove). 8. Is a large bay open to the eastward. There is a sheltered anchorage inside Bed Islands for one or two vessels, but it is not of any value except as a temporary shelter from north-westerly winds. [d) Fak-al-Assad Strait. 9. Is quite easy to pass through. The tides are strong and a good speed should be maintained. It is quite 3 cables across, the rocks drop so perpendi cularly that they look like door-posts. 2383 F. D. 'HlllllfflM2 (e) The Bays on the northern part of the Promontory. 10. Are all exposed to the north, as the chart shews. (/) Khor Kawi, 11. Is a fine sheltered anchorage. It is 3 cables wide at the northern entrance, and about 6 to 7 cables wide most of its length; the depth of water is from 15 to 19 fathoms according to the chart. q* 12. It is formed by the island of Jezirat al Ghanam (Sheep Island) and the mainland. The island is about 100 feet high at its lowest saddle, and from its northern end a rocky point juts out about 2 cables and looks like a pier. In the angle thus formed is a ledge of rock which appears to have about 3 feet of water on it, and to cover about an acre. This rocky point makes the harbour secure against any swell rolling in from the northward. 13. To the southward of the point is a Bay formed by an indentation in the island. 14. The Khor appears capable of sheltering several large cruisers at single anchor, and more if moored, besides a number of small craft. 15. Owing to the tides, the northern entrance is more difficult than the southern to enter. The latter is land locked, owing to the conformation of the Musandam Promontory, but for a steam*ship both are quite easy of approach. 16. Khor Kawi may, on further examination, turn out to be very suitable for a coaling station; a survey will shortly be undertaken. Its strategical position is excellent, and in conjunction with the Islands of Kishm, Henjam, Larak, and Hormuz, it will form a strong position for the control of the entrance to the Gulf. 17. The danger of ships being taken by surprise can be averted by forming a signal station on the high hill on Sheep Island, from which a long range of vision can be obtained, and warning given in sufficient time of the approach of any vessel. 18. The bay at the south-east corner of the southern entrance will also be examined to ascertain its capabilities as a torpedo station. (y) Khor ash Shem {Elphinstone Inlet). 19. Is a magnificent piece of water, 7 miles long. It has anchorages all over it, and many coves. The usual anchorage is near Telegraph Island, which is about the hottest part of it. 20. Surrounded by high mountains and barren rocky hills, no breeze can reach Telegraph Island, or the middle of the Khor, consequently the air must be still and the radiation great. In fact the heat is too great for Europeans to bear, and even the Arab nomads who fish there, move in the hot weather. At 3 p.m. on 20th November (when I visited it) the thermometer stood at 86 0 P. If this is the winter temperature, what must it be in summer ? 21. By landing and climbing the ridge in the Maklab Isthmus, about 200 feet high, one can look down on Malcolm Inlet, and have a fine view of it (except the cove with Filam at its bead) and of Elphinstone Inlet. The ridge is about equidistant from both inlets. 22. To defend Elphinstone Inlet it would be necessary to hold the ridge of the Maklab Isthmus, as well as the entrance, but owing to the heat it could not be occupied from July to October, and therefore as a naval station it is not of much value. III.— Shargah. 23. This place is quite open to the northward, and with a northerly wind a nasty swell rolls into the roadstead. 24. The Jowashmi Sheikh of Shargah resides here and it is the centre of the pearling fishery, but otherwise it is not of any importance The Sheikh is acknowledged as the most important of the Trucial Chiefs.IV. —Bunder Abbas. 25 . This town is situated on the mainland of Persia opposite the town of Kishm in the Island of Kism, from which it is distant about 13 miles. 26 . The water is shallow, and ships lie a good 1 miles from the shore although the Sphinx can go in to about miles from the town. Ten and a quarter miles from it is Hormuz Island, and almost due south, about 18 miles, is Larak Island. 27 . Between the town of Kishm and Bunder Abbas and to the westward is a good roadstead at the entrance of the Clarence Strait. This strait would he navigable by large ships, if it were buoyed, as far as Bassidu, which is nearly 65 miles to the westward by this channel. 28 . A good anchorage is reported off Laft point, but this is 32 miles from Kishm, and too much out of the way for war purposes. 29 . This entrance to the Clarence Strait was, and might be again, the rendezvous of a large expeditionary force operating in Southern Persia. V. —Hen jam Strait. 30 . There is a temporary anchorage off Henjam Island in the strait between that Island and Kishm, and at this point a telegraph station formerly existed. It is about to be resumed by tbe Government of India, and could be used as a war signal station, if required, as it is easy of approach from either the east or west. 31 . It is not of any use as a permanent anchorage or dep6t. As it is only 31 miles from Khor Kawi it could easily be connected with it by cable when found necessary, should that place become a coaling station. VI.— Bassidu. 32 . As a deep water channel was said to exist to the southward of Kishm Island, I examined it in H. M. S. Sphinx, followed later by the B. I. M. S. Lawrence. 33 . A 4 to fathom channel was found, a tracing of which will be sent to tbe Hydrographer, but it is not easy to find, except in fine weather and by use of the lead. It is not at any time suitable for a second class cruiser, but she might use it with care in clear weather. 34 . Bassidu was used in the old days by small craft belonging to the Indian Navy. There is deep and good anchorage off it, but it is a small craft place. On going to Lingah from it in the Sphinx we passed over a long bank with fathoms on it—this being the only passage. 35 . The pier is in fairly good order, but most of the old buildings are in ruins. A heap of old coal, probably about 5 tons, lies in the open. There is a flagstaff on which the British flag is hoisted, and an old Arab (the British Agent) receives Rs. 12 a year for doing so (in addition to Rs. 30 as agent, and Rs. 7 for taking mails to and from Lingah). He is a Briton of the British. 36 . According to a plan the area of British territory is roughly 600 acres. 37 . The Agent confirmed the statement that Singao is British, but that old Bassidu is not. He stated that the Russian Consul at Bunder Abbas visited Bassidu last spring with a Persian official. 38 . Some of the Arabs living at Lingah and in other parts of Kishm are very anxious to settle at Bassidu under the British, and thus escape the heavy Customs dues, but they have not hitherto been encouraged to do so. It would probably soon absorb the trade from Lingah and the adjacent ports if it became a free port under the protection of the Government of India. 39. Bassidu was granted to the British in 1820 by the Iman of Maskat, who at that time had a lease of the island of Kishm. When the Persiansforcibly resumed the island no challenge to our rights was ever made, and we have thus kept a footing there. VIL— -Lingah. 40. This is an important town, owing to it being a trading centre, and the fact that, unlike most Gulf ports, large vessels can lie within a mile or so of the shore. The anchorage is exposed to the south-west, but sheltered from most ^ winds. 41. Several of the domed cisterns mentioned in N. I. D. Report No. 694 were empty when I was at Lingah and others had only a little dirty water in them. They appeared to have a capacity of about 60,000 gallons each. VIII.— Bahrein. 42. I visited this place in the Sphinx. A second class cruiser drawing not more than 22 feet 6 inches could enter Bahrein harbour one hour before high tide, and anchor 5 miles from the town and about 4 miles from Muharrak. 43. Bahrein is not of any value as a base for war purposes. 44. I notice that in the N. I. D. Report No. 694, Bar al Katr is said to be under Turkish control. This is not the case. The British support the independence of the Sheikhs, and have lately objected to a Turkish Mudir being appointed for the district. IX. —Koweit. 45. The importance of the Bay of Koweit has been somewhat over-rated, and that of Khor Abdullah lost sight of until it is too late, the Turks having now established themselves at Umkasr, and on the island of Bubiyan. 46. A large vessel could lie in the anchorage in any weather, but a collier could not lie alongside her in a Shamal. Vessels lie about 2 miles from the shore. 47. During the stay of the squadron many small caravans were observed to enter and leave the town, showing that there is probably a considerable trade overland. 48. ^ I proceeded up the Bay in the Sphinx. A second class cruiser can go up to within 2^ miles of the shore near Jehara, which town is over half a mile inland. It is a fine bay, but the shallowness of the water near the shore detracts from its value. The head of the bay is, however, of course more sheltered than the part of it near Koweit. X.— Khor Abdullah. 49 . Leaving Koweit with my flag in the Sphinx at 10 p.m., followed by the Lawrence, I proceeded to Khor Abdullah, and entered it at daylight on the following day, passing Ras al Geit, the Turkish post on the south-east of Bubiyan Island, where the Turkish flag was flying. This post cannot be approached to within about 3 miles by water, owing to the mud flats off it. We arrived at the bar between Warba Island and the mainland, and found 2 fathoms at low water. Passing over it into deep water we entered the Khor leading to Umkasr, navigation being quite easy, except for the bar. Arriving near Umkasr, which is a Turkish fort with no village, we anchored, and, after looking round, proceeded out of the Khor. 50. Our observation led us to the conclusion that the proposed railway will probably come to a point on the mainland opposite the north-west corner of Bubiyan Island, where there is a sheet of water, with plenty of depth and room for an anchorage. It can also be approached easily at any time of tide. 51. Bubiyan Island and the shore on the mainland opposite are claimed by the Sheikh of Koweit. He has now been formally taken under BritishV wH felibsrt? tditi^b: iBitnuiika IWiillir. sfaffti ik protection by the Indian Government, and has been directed to establish two posts, one on the north side of Bubiyan island and the other on the north west corner, and the Turks will be warned by him to leave the island. , ,, 52 ' 0n proceeding out of the Khor Abdullah I noticed a fl’at with 4 fathoms on it, at about 1| hours’ flood. The Khor requires a careful survey. XL— Khor Musa. 53. Having anchored off Khor Musa at 11-30 p.m. in the Sphinx with followin^day m COmpany ’ we Proceeded up the Khor at daylight on the When once we were sure that we had struck the entrance, navigation was quite easy This is ascertained by seeing Bu Saif, a low point with a few trees on it, and the islet of Aitch Shaham. From this the Khor is a splendid sheet of water, ending at anchorage No. 1. where a large fleet could anchor. Here i branches into the inlet leading to No. 2, which we did not enter, and to No. 3 anchorage. We went up to within about 1| miles of No. 3, and anchored in 36 feet, whilst a party landed to test the mud flats. It was thought that at high water springs the flats would he covered. The landing at No. 1 will be a difficulty, no doubt, for the banks appear o e no more than mud flats, which may be covered at hi^h water springs under some circumstances. XII.— The Khors Generally. T ,i 54 4ntil a railway is brought from the interior to either Khor Abdullah or Khor Musa, they are not of value to a country strong on land, so that their development belongs rather to the future than the present. I suppose in time Russia will connect her railway system with Khor Abdullah Germany wil1 C0I1E ect her Bagdad Railway system with Khor It is incumbent on us, therefore, to prepare to hold the entrance to the Lult, unless we can keep those Powers away from it altogether, which should be our constant aim. XIII.— Conclusion. 55. The Hyacinth and Hardinge having been given a rendezvous 9 mi es south-south-east of Khor Musa, His Excellency the Viceroy re-embarked m tne Hardinge and I returned to the Hyacinth at 7 p.m., and we pro- ceeuea to Bushire, where the squadron anchored next morning 5i miles from e shore, and fe-g- miles by water from Bushire town.
