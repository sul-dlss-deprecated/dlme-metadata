Whatever may have bean the official differences between Hedgcock and nyeelf I would not hawe you Imagine,as I think you well night irom certain passages In his letter,that I In any way adopted a consistently hostile attitude towards hla. On the contrary from the moment he arrived I did all X could.an* I think with success.to cultlwate ^ f friendly relations with hlm,whleh was all the easier as personally I liked him. I exercised considerable patience with hi? moods,and om more than one occasion (vide for Inrntance para 3 of my letter No. 114-0 of 14th April forwarded to you under Col.Blscoe's Ho:202.S of i.'2nd April) went to some length In trying to win him over to a reasonable attitude. r\ - -■ * *** * 'J t'' J , g 0ise of the remarks contained In Hedgcock's letter re rger-^lv foolish,others are offensive. ' Every device has been used to protect the Levy budget,Including cooked figures and the employment of the Consular treasury staff on the preparation of formidable but Inaccurate 'man-day? tables! Muscat's dally Increasing Indebtedness Is Ignored In the Interest attaching to the military versus civilian contest.' There was no 'contest' - except In the Imagination of of Hedgcock,whounfortunetely Is on. of thoeo people .ho - when the, aon't get .hat the, .ant - Imagine that the, are the victims of •oonsplraolea' and•rings'. 1. derloee' were used to 'protect the Lev, Budget'.

He iB grateful/ for this at the time,but convenlentl, forgets it aer rltlne to you. . ills remark as to 'cooked figures' Is M course Indefensible. The facts about the 'man-da, tables',for Instance.which he quotes are as follows. The problem was to make the cut suggested b. Colonel Blseee on his visit to Susoat In Pebruar, and accepted b, the Council, then the details of this came to be worked out b. Walker tCommandant of the Lev,) Hedgcock was ver, criticalt' this was not a correct set of flgurm. for comparison. and that wasn't something els. and so forth. I daresa, from the strict financial point of view he was correct. but as -e were ;i working for the same object in a small place like uecst 1 tUlnk ue might have been more helpful. His attitude was naturall, not a lit le irritating to talker.but as It was m, business to get both of them to come to some mutuall, agreed mpXntmm figures.I advised talker to -ereever. In his attempts which he dld.and gave him what assistance I could. One of the standards of comparison which was put up was the 'man s da,s' to which Hedgcock so polltel, refers.and which he picked holes in. Pins 11, a set of figures was produced which H^oock had to4ft ' i h ^4 ^ admit formed a fair basis for making tha out agreed upon* 5* One good thing emerged from all this: besides the cut agreed upon orther economies were effected in the cost of the Leyy. Hedgcock pointed out that various cuts could be made in the pay and allowances of Levy followers etc without in any way affecting the efficiency of d / the Corps* Harlnf: examined these suggestions I quite arreeisnd went into the matter with Walker,who was only too willing to cooperate. After a good deal of hard work by Walker and myself«by cutting some rupees here and some rupees there, a respectable sua in the aggregate was saved,and the final result was tfcrt this su»b ,added to the agreed cut,brought the new Levy Budget for a full year of twelve- months to less than what Hedgcock had rsked for in February»even without the further economy effected by having no British Officer as Commnadant for some months* Hedfecock is still not satisfied because the saving is not made exactly in the way he wants,but one can't have everything one in this world exactly as wants it* 6* With regard to my 'private interview^ with the Council to which uedgcook seems to give a sinister twist* When he resigned the Cofcnoil asked my advice* I said that it was for them to decide but that prima s facie it was not much good trying tc keep on a dissa^tlfled officer. They agreed,said they were prepared to accept Hedgcock's resignation, and I reported accordingly to Colonel Biscoe# A day or eo after that Hedgcock informed me that the Council wanted mm tJta to reconsider his realgnation* I again interviewed the Council who told me that they had changed their minds and would like to give Ued^.oock a month toreconsider his decision. I reported this deTelopoent to Colonel Biscoe. 7. I am sorry that Hedgcock has prored so Intractable. I took a lot of ouble to keep him on the ralls 9 and made erery allowance for the diffic ult job he had In following Thorns,as I saw that,In spite of his hard-working and keen - (at any rate until lately when he began to sulk)-' and I f*it If I goulf^ have got him to work with ua instead of against us It would have be*a for the real benefit of the 5tate* I must apologise for Inflicting on you such a long letter,but as Hedgcock's letter to you ha« some personal applications concerning myself I have allowed myself some latitude* I am sending a copy of this to Colonel Biscoe,-5- ..wti tial.

'.Then dis cussing the case with His Excellency I did not conceal from him my impression, derived no doubt from information furnished by Hedgcock, that if rightly handed Saiyid Said might develop into an ttXrev;iivo riuier of Lli© Liuscat State. If mishandled he would probably become useless like his father ? acxivaly and possibly even/mischievous. From what I knew of Hedgcock in laesopotomia I think that he is capable of supplying some of the necessary advice and influence and this weighed very largely with me in not insisting upon his immediate removal from the scene. I hope that you will be able to see your way to fall in with the solution proposed which I really think is that best calculated to further Muscat interests.

An Adviser is a nuisance in my experience. He always tends to encroach on fields which do not concern him and let go the rgins and lose his interest. In my humble opinion /hich counts for nothing, Arab States should be allowed to go on their natural way and the P.

Tou will I hope hawe got my telegram the India Office to the effect that in sy opinion Hedgci should go* The question of Mignity** - yours and mine to -v which Howell refers - is really &amp; minor question. So also is that of Muscat finances. On finances there is always room for two or three opinions; the reason * as you are aware ~ why you recommended Hedgcock going was his general attitude especially ris-a-yis the Council and the latter to the Oovernment of India. This argument still remains. Another reason why he should not come back is that it is Tery doubtful whether he or any other Financial Adriser is really necessary at Muscat. You will remember that you put up a proposal to GoTernment, to which they did not return a final reply f to the effect that Alban should manag the duties of Financial AdTiser and Commandant of the Legie and I attach an extract from a letter of Alban in this connection. It seems to me that the people whose 'dignity would suffer the most by Hedgoock returning to Muscat would r\ be the unfortunate Council. Hedgcock resigns, they give him another chance to change his mind, he does so, and states he wishes to remain* Then under pressure frofc us the Council dismiss him definitely.

British Residency, Bushire, the 9th -^uly 1931. Dear Hedgeock, Reference our conversation of yesterday afternoon* before actually going into the question of the alleged irregularities of waller, ( . ./hich we can do at our meeting), there were one or two other matters which -v way of clearing the ground we discussed as follows, 2, The alleged irregularities without going into details at this stage can be divided ijjito two parts:- (a) that /alker paid for Mrs. Talker* s, passage to Karachi and that of a servant out of State money, beyond the terms of his contract; (b) that a certain number of his domestic servants were p. id out of State funds. 3. ./ith regard to (a) and (b), you said that you did not write to me on either sucject but mentioned them to ine verbally at different times. 4, The obvious question arises, which I put to you, is why you did not write me - as then T. olitical Agent, Muscat - an official, or demi-official report, on the subject of these irregularities at the time when talker and I were both on the spot in 'Muscat. 5. Your reasons are as follows, iith regard to both (a) and (b). Relations bein^ already strained between /alker and yourself over the proposed reductions in the Levies .... . r edjcoc^,^scLevies you did not wisii to brinj; a personal note into your arguments witil liinij and so rurtlier coiipl-ica e t . q issue# fith. regard to (b) , up to the time when talker left I'uscat, you had only suspicions as to what was going . on.

Prior to Uarch 15th, I had. in your and Walker's presence, strongly hinted that the State of Unseat was yayir-t for unnecessary followers (e.g.the dhobij and ti^t there was a discrepancy in the ration rot- rr.. 5, After March 15th I went through the Levy accounts for 1930, and three facts came sig to ny nclic;. (a) that .Talker's boatman had been paid from otate funds; (b) that Urs.ffalker and one servant had received a State-paid passage to ivaracm an return utj end the terms biker 's contract; (c) that there was a discrepancy in the ration retarn, 4 0 I brought the above facts to your notice veroally, and suggested a court of enquiry, 'ou did not I as Alban did later ) ask for my proofs nor request me to report to you in writing. I, for my part, did not press t.ie Mat: further as from the beginning I had been reluctant to complicate the question of obtaining substantial reductions in the levy budget by bringing in a personal issue. Vher I eventually reported the above three facts to you, my chief aim was to shake your confidence in ./alker and thus indirectly influence the dispatch you were writing to the Political Resident on the Levy budget. For this purpose .C. /.Fowle ,C*I considered a verbal report sufficients 5, In Hay ( after you and Talker had left Muscat ) the Subedar Major, on his own authority discharged certain followers who had become surplus to requirements owin^ to the absence of a British Cofcniaudant &lt;&gt; It was this action which first brought to light the unexpectedly large nunber of followers used by ,/alker for his personal needs. Alban* s enquiries revealed that talker's cook was a ' r aik on the strength of the 'iscat Infantry• 6« The above turned iny strong suspicions into certainties as far as the followers ( except the boatman) were concerned. Yours sincerely, sd/- S. Hed^cock. I asked Walker for his explanation about the free passage to his wife and servant, and subsequently informed you of the reply he gavec 3,0,So.411-3 of 1931.

Hedgcock arrived on the 6th July, and i have been going into the question of Walker's alleged irregularities with hirrio nedgcock brought a file or two with him anc. lias given roe enough material on which to give an opinion on this matter. Owing, however, to pressure of work.i snal^ot have it ready until next mail» J-n the meantime ijnave ciertain remarks to make on iledgcoc^s statement to you that he had reported to me the fact of these irregularities, ana his general attitude on the matter* I'm afraid this will be rather a long letter, but you will find a summary of my opinion as far as Hedgcock is concerned in the last paragraph. 3. The method i have adopted for the investigation is to have a series of conversations with nedgcock, confirmed afterwardsby him by replies to letters from.me. it is rather a laborious nethcd, but i think most satisfactory A.to.H, to both sides. Copies of the letters are attached and marked A, B, etc. for ready reference . JLhe letters contain matters connected with Medgcock himself as well as v/alker, and i will submit fresh copies when sending in uy report on the latter.

The first general point 1 wish to emphasise is that as long as there is a financial Adviser in the naiscat State it ia he and nut the Political Agent who is responsible for Muscat finances, to suppose otherwise is to place the Political Agent in the impossible position of responsibility without authority. if the financial Adviser is not to be responsible then why have such an expensive luxury V The only circumstances under which the jfolitical Agent can be held responsible for reporting, or investigating, Muscat finances, whether irregularities or orjieruise, are when they have been properly reported zo him by the financial Adviser. 5. it follows from tlii s that the political Agent is /% / neither the financial Adviser's ane d amne e nor his private detective though Hedgcocic appears to think he is something of both. ' He (Hedgcock; 'knows nothing about the cook lone of Walker's alleged irregularites; beyond the statement contained in paragraph 3 of Alban • s D.C .uo. 1.54/G of 9th June' ( in letter^D ,, , paragraph4 j. why doesn't he know? The checking of financial irregularities is his Job, not Alban 'so He asks me_ under what authority did Walker claim, ana get from him (Hedgcock^ the passage on which he {waIker^ left Muscat ( a week after i did f; (see letter ,paragraph 2). 1 know no more than the Man in the iioon and naturally replied with a counter-query: under what authority did he (Hedgcock; the sanctioning auJiority give it to him? (Walker) o (Letter 'G'^para 2;. 'Alban informed me walker paid the dhobi Ks.5/- etc.' (enclosure to letter Why hasn't Hedgcock make his own investigations into this V He apparently only does half hie work as far as investigating irregularities is concerned, and appears to expect the j-oli ti calPolitical Agent to do the other hall, ^orhiru 6 0 Another point i vdsh to Oiiphasise is that such criticisms as 1 ain now roiiking with regard to hedgco ck have nothing to do with iiie cori'ectness or otherwise of what he wanted to do with regard to i.evy eco nomie s ,etc» xhe nerely cover the attitude which lie nas uaiien up with regard to Walter 1 s alleged irregularities, and witn regard to me. 7, 'Hedgcoclc says that h$ brought this matter ^walrzer's irregularities^ to Jfowle's notice, 'but is nox aware wnether ]7owle reported it to you or not® Do not suppose that i regard these allegations as already proved, but if they were made to Fowle he ought certainly to have reported them to you and the matter seems to need clearing up- 4 { your letter of 23rd June to Colonel iiiscoe;. upinions may di-'fer, 'but personally if 'A' takes the responsibility to coiiie to mt and say that he has brought the matter oi 'iv s' ixregular ities to the notice of 'C' ,i conclude that he h^s done it T/ery emphatically, and that - if 'C' has not listened to him - he has followed it up with a written report -official,or txie least demi-official, nothing of this nature occurred in the present instance, as you will see 1 roro paragrttphs 8, ^ and 10, and in ray opinion therefore neclgcoc^s informing you that he had 'brought the matter to my ncatice is a mis statement pure and simple. 8 „ This is not of course the first occasion on which Hedgcock has made a mis-statement about me » j.n his letter of 18th April 1931 to you which you forv-araed for my information, he stated that my accounts at uuscat had been , cooked , in order to assist Walker, ana r iiat the Consulate Staff ....Staff there wer^ased to thwart his efforts, un receipt of this letter i wrote to you [ !&gt;. u. no .nil, dated tiie 18th May 1931) pointing out the facts which were as follows* After Colonel J^iscoe^ visit to Muscat in February anahis decision that a certain sun should be cut from the j^evy uuu^et a violent contrave sy took place between ned^cock and Walker asto how this cut ought to be effected, each side producing sheets of figures. i wasnot responsible for the correctness of their figures,but i gave i/iy good offices in order to get them to come to some agreed total. My clerical staff too were at their aisposal to assist them in adding up figures, etc. and in iiedgcock's case especially far from my staff being used to thwart his efforts, they gave him definite assistance in the way of typing, as he was short-handed at the time. ihis being so, in ray letter to you 1 summealip Medgcock's remarks as y T both ^silly and offensive'* in your reply of Slst- May y you said you were not altogether surprised that i found some of the remarks in hedgcock^ letter rather difficult to digest, but that you did not think i need take them too seriously, and as Hedgcock was leaving Muscat, i was quite willing to leave it at that, in your letter you said that in another communication Hedgcock stated that ' he had always maintained friendly personalrelations with you ana was under considerable obligation to you for helping him in a variety of ways'*. in which case he has showed a very queer way of paying off his obligation 9. To return to his latest mis-statement• he admits that he never informed ne in writing, merely verbally, ( Letter 'B', paragraph 4;. curing ray time at Muscat he sent me a regular stream of official and demi-official lettersv -5~ « ( he is inclined to be prolix;, on Levy subjects, yet never once mentioned, or evenliinted at, anytiiing about ..ese irregularities. ^ 10« With regard to his verbal coniQunications. xhe allegations against '/alker may be divided into two main parts - la) and (b; { viae letter 'A',paragraph 2). i informed Medecock in my letter 'G' that i have no recollection of his mentioning the case of './alker's passage to me^a;® x cio remember vaguely his mentioning something about walker's dhobi or punka- wala, being partly paid by the State ib;. in fairness to *iedgcock i am quite prepared to admit that lie may have mentioned the question o^ the passages to me in a casual manner. At a time a comroversy was running high between Hed^cock and Walker ^paragraph B above). .Both iiedgcocx and Walker would come to me to fulminate against each other, and - as is often the case when this sort of thing happens - would go outside the points we were trying to settle. when this occurred 1 paid very little attention to what they said and merely tried to induce them to leave my office in order to let me get on with my work. it is quite possible that on one of these occasions Hedgcock mentioned the subject of walker's passages to me, but i have no recollection of it. As for his statement (fetter •♦iJ' ,para 4) that he suggested a court of enquiry, i am prepared to deny it flatly. with regard to (bj - according to his own statement (Letter •♦.«',para b;- it was not until Walker and i liad both left Muscat that his (Hedgcock'sj suspicions were turned into certainties, so he could not have made much of a point of it when mentioning the case of the dhobi, punkhawala,or whoever he was. 11. in letter 'B' »para 4, -nedgcock states that - unlike Alban later - j. did not ask for proofs nor request him to give me a reportin writing. ihave already (para 10 above; dealt with the way in which nedgcock ''brought to my notice' the matte ib in question. when-6- -jn/ When Walker fed left, Hedgcock's suspicions -became certainties, and presumably he then brouglit the matter strongly to Alban ' s notice. 12o The really important question, aowever, is why Hedgcock - who according to his own statement coneidered the matter serious enough to suggest a court oi enquiry did not address me a report or a demi-official report on the subject of the irregular!tes» both what he knew ana what he suspected, when walker - the individual - wuom he accuses of these irregularities - and i were both on the spot in Muscat, he had a second chance even after ihaci .Ic t Muscat on 18th April, as i was still x-olitical Agent in Karachi on recess until the 24th May when i left ror Bushire. He states that it was after walker left { on tne 25th April) (letter ,para 5; that his suspicions as to one part of the irregularities ^para 10 above) were confirmed, yet he still wrote me no report, 'vviiile Alban to whom he confidedhis suspicions did not reach Muscat until about the 7th June. 13, His reasons for this obvious omission are given in para 4 of letter 'B'. .briefly they are that he did not wish to complicate the question c' obtaining reductions in the Levy budget by bringing in a personal issue. This on the face of it is so inadequate that it needs no comment, he goes on to say 'when i eventually reported the above three facts to you, my chief aim was to shake your confidence in walker ana thus inairectly influence the dispatch you were writing to the political Hesiaent on the Levy budget. ^or this purpose i considered a Verbal report sufficient rt . This seems to me an extraordinary statement• ...statement* His object in making in what he is pleased to i call a H verbal report' was no t to move me to enquire into these irregularities, or to recover for the state what Walker might have taken from it, 'but to 'shake my confidence in Walker'. This sort of thing may be very Machiavellian and clever but frankly to me it savours more of the tortuous methods of an /\rab ahaikh than those o a British official. 14. As it is not the first time that nedgcock has made a statement about me - vide para 6 above, so it is not the first time that he has shirked putting down on paper facts with regard to individuals whom he has accused verbally. When Hedgcock's predecessor - Thomas - left Muscat, the question of what disciplinary action should be taken against him arose ( i neea not go into the case in full, as you are well aware of itj. under a clause in Thomas* contract Hedgcock suggested arbitration by the Political Resident, and put up various minor more or less technical objections connected with ihomas* over staying his leave in England,e^c. ihe main point against Thomas was, however, ohat in making his Journey into the ^ubal-ai-Khali, he had deliberately gone beyond the leave granted him by the Council, tliough he knew that he ooula not be hi ck in iAuscat for another three months, and thst his successor to whom he was to hand over was expected in a few weeks, and when the State itself was in the throe of a serious financial crisis. i pressed Medgcock very hard to aad this count to his of fi cial letter to me asking for arbitrationc Me absolutely refused to do^saying that he . . .8' 7' he thought this would be 'vindictive', finally, in order tu bring this pojnt, as far as i could, *:o the notice oi t e arbitrator — Colonel Jiiscoe — i seno it in *11 a de .ii- official form explaining why i had to do so. 15, i think this shows - if it is really necessary to do so - that 1 am quite willing to report matters which i have knowledge of and equally that HedgcowC is fond 0* shirking his responsibility in this respect» 16, There is no doU^'t that hedgcmck^s views as o enquiries into irregularities are unortiiouo.^» J.n one O j . our conversations - letter 'G'^Potra - he mentioned that there were minor irregularities ot wal kfc which he ./as doubtful whether it would be worth while pressing now, ana asked me if they could be brought up 'later'? 10 tiiis amazing suggestion 1 replied tliat all the irregularities must be ^bought up now. 17, SUMMARY. it may be convenient to summarise ray letter as follovys. There are two general points i have emphasised» i^'irst that my present criticisms of hedgcock have no tiling to do with his financial policy with regard to the Muscate btate and to Muscat Levies (para 6 above j. The second is that the financial Adviser is the individual responsible for the finances of the Muscat State anc. not the .foli ical Agent. To suppose otherwise is to put the jrolitical Agent in the impossible position of responsibility without authority, xhe only responsibility that can be laid on the political Agent is that of reporting on, or investigating, Muscat finances when they have been properly reported to him by the financial Adviser (para 4;. m the present instance, hedgco ck in omitting to do this vparas 9 and 10 J was - inmy opinion - guilty of a grave dereliction of duty^ ne■ I f -9- He aggravated his offence by stating to you tliat he had brought this matter to ray notice ^para 7; which lie had nut done o lie had already previously made another mis-statement about rae , which was the subject of corresponaence be ween you and 1 (para 8).

Fowle.Gonfidentiai &lt; No«C *&gt;156 of 1931. The Political Agency &amp; H.B.M*» Consulate, Muscat,3th July 1931. From Captain R.G.Alban, Politxcal A ^ent &amp; H.B.M* s Cons MUSCAT 1 To The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf# B U S H I R E. Sir I have the honour to draw your attention to tiie fact that as a result of certain messages which nave,iecently, been coming through from the late Financial Adviser addressed to the Heir Ai^arent and myself« xt seems that tj.ere is some moyement afoot which has as its object the re-engagement of Mr* Hedj^coc]c , s services by the State# As to whether or no this is so I cannot say, but, having in view the possibility that such ai. act,i^u itexj Q ^'-d on in the near future, it is as well that trie following facts should be brought to the notice of the Government of Inixa* he found that, owing to the complete lack of any business instinct of the present Sultanr Saiyid Taimur&gt; and the very primitive administrative arrangement5in all de^rtments, the State had drifted deep into debt. The Customs department was in the hands of a Bannia and the Sultan was in the habit of signing 'chits' for any sums of money he happened to require, the amounts on these chits being entered up against his name in the Bannia 1 s books and deducted from the amounts collected by the Bannia on account of customs dues® As might have been expected, partly owing to the reckless and unchecked extravagance of the Sultan and partly z When Idajor HAwarth was political Agent at lluscat2. to fraud and lax collection on the ^art of the customs farmers, the expenditure always exceeded tne revenue. It was at this sta^e, in iyiy f that the Government _ # ol India stepped in wxth the offer of financial assistance to pay off the Sultanas debtso In return for this the Sultan was to reform his administration and to assist him in this a European Adviser was en^a^ed. The prime reason for engaging and retaining the services of this official was to supervise the ^orlcinfe of the re forms mentioned above, control expenditure and watch the collection of revenue by the customs. Of the Sultan, Major Haworth wrote in 1919, •♦he is weaic in many w^rs, though not in all, while in any case he is totally ignorant'• 6. Under these circumstances, with the State finances in complete chaos, so complete that no accounts of revenue or expenditure were in existence other than those contained in the Bannia^ private account books, with the Sultan hopelessly at sea and quite unfitted to clear up the situation and set up a proper Treasury and Customs Administration with a regular system of accounting, there was no other course left open than reluctantly to engage a European Adviser until such time as the State could stand upon its own feet. • This desirable result would obviously come about either (a) by the Sultan himself developing a keenness and aptitude for affairs of State, or (b) by his producing a son with these qualities. It would also be necessary to employ sufficiently capable and trustworthy heads of departments to enable the machine to function with only the minimum of supervision# 8* After A iapsdof twelve years during which the State has been completely run by British Advisers, nominally working through a body called the Council of Ministers, the Sultan has3. V- produced a son^ Saiyid Said, who wiiile poaBessin^ all the dx^nity of his father has all the qualities which he lacks. 9 # At the end of iy30 Kr. Thoma»t the last Adriser^ completed his term of five years with the State and left# ay At the same time, the services of new Adnser, Mr. Hedgcocic, /v were enga^edfbut, after a few months employment in tiie State, his services were, for sound reasons, dispensed with. 10» In the mean time, Saiyid Said, the Heir Apparent, has suddenly come forward# He is now 21, has had a first class education at the Chiefs College, Ajmer, and has also completed a finishing course at Baghdad# He takes a very deep interest in the State and is unhappy when out of it, he is careful over money matters, has a complete grasp of the details of the State budget and finance, his justice and the swiftness with which he metes out retribution to offenders are a byword throughout the country* His energy and courage are well known, it is only a few months since he sallied forth with a handfull of men and displaced his uncle, the Wali of Sahar, who for many years has been notorious for his brutality and tyranny and was by way of becomming a independent ruler. Now, a^am, he is off to Sur to study the situation there with a view to maicing a lasting settlement of what has, in the past been, a rather disturbed area. 11 # These qualities, combined with a dignified demeanour a proper respect for his father the Sultan, and a fixed deter mination to continue unabated the long friendship existing between the Sultanate of iTuscat and Oman and the British and Indian Governments, have earned for him the deepest respect and loyalty of his subjects and maice him an eminently suitable person to be entrusted witn the full control of all the affairs of the State. 12. The day, for which the British Government has'7 waited twelre years, has now arrived and the complete adminis tration of the State is now in the hands of the Heir Apparent# Yesterday^ after years of deficit tudgets under a British Adviser during which the State has contracted some three lacs of dehts, Saiyid Said entirely unaided and alone, produced his first 'budget# 15. Notwithstanding the fact that six months of the year iy31 have already passed and that only on the second six months can the revised budget taxe effect, yet, so effective are the economies made and so carefully has each item been checked that the expenditure for the whole year 1931 will be fajl substantially less than the revenue, and, after paying.usual instalment of the Government of India debt, a surplus will remain with winch to commence repayment of the debts mentioned above* 14. This, I may mention^ is qu^te unprecedented, no member of the ruling family has ever been able or had any desire to cope with finance, and it is fair to say that although most of the economies were talxed over with and xDLtKaxjLsjejt outlined by Mr. Hed^cocic before he left Kuscat nearly a month ago, yet Saiyid Said has, the Treasury Officer tells me, himself been carefully through every item of expenditure of tne State and inade all cuts and reductions himself. As regards the Levy Corps, Saiyid Said has hi*self had many consultations with the Officer Commanding and the result is a budget considerably less than that drawn Ui# by Kr. Hedgcock and yet ample for meeting all the requirements of the force as it stands* 15* The foregoing outline of events and description of the situation have been given for the information ofthe Government of India, who, involved in other aifairs and far removed from the scene of these happenings must be in ignor ance of the tru itate of affairs. That the period of interregnum has now come to an end is5. clear and no further reason exists for placing a Government nominee in control of finance and thus^ of the whole State^ for the finances and the administration of the State are bound uji together. The placing of a British official in such a position in a small State like Muscat, experience teaches us, is 'bound -to to lead a gradual absorption by him of all the functions of tne l\ Huler and at this particular moment it would, in addition, lead to the stultification and atrophy of those very powers of rule and administration which are beginning to show so clearly in the Heir Apparent, and which the Government of India desires above all things to foster. The tendency to leave more and more things to be done by the Adviser is bound to appear and unless the prospective Ruler himself controls the finances he is scarcely to be expected to gain that control of the adminis trative departments of the State which is so essential. The subject of the late Adviser and the reasons why his services were dispensed with by tne State, are now, in view of the length of time which has elapsed and the impossibility of the State having any further use for his services, somewhat academical. In view, however, of the possibility of some encouragement having been given him, on his wanderings, to hope for re-employment in the State, it is as well to note again that the reasons for having advised the State to dispense with his services were, that he had taicen up an attitude which con veyed that the Government of India were not seeking the best interests of the State and that he had embodied those sentiments in his letter to the Council preferring his resignation. 18. What is infinitely worse, however, is, that up to the moment of leaving here to express his regret to the Govern- ment of India for tnese past misdeeds and^request that they be H ) ^ overlooked, he lost no opportunity of filling my ears with reports of the resentment felt by Saiyid Said and other membersv/ of the royal faioily at the interfer^ing policy of the Govern ment of India and their suspicion that the sole object of the aforesaid Government was to force the State into bankruptcy and then by means of another loan to bring it more completely under its thumb# To imagine that there can be any thought ol the re- engagement of a person who goes aoout soliciting s-icju ^itws slk or encouraging by a feympathetic demeanour the ex|j 'ession oi sentiments or dropping of hints tending to Lnng into discredit the Government of India and their dzffiKwlXiMM repreBcntatives in the Persian Gulf is to imagine a vain thing. 20. In addition to this, the firm friendship and goodwill, as expressed by the Sultan, the Council and every Arab in the State towards the British Government and the Governiuent of India, renders intolerable the presence of one who seems ^ent on creating a gulf between the State and the Government of India and who seeks in every chance remark overheard a confirmation of his view that the State has been subject to injustice and oppression at the hands of the aforesaid Government mf India. 21. It is needless to recapitulate here thm/ constant solicitude and anxiety to promote the best interests oi the State which has always been shown by the Government of India, no one is better aware of this than tiie son, even the poorest Arab or Baluch fisherman ti . i c !, Daulat M whose name alone is sufficient to preserve peace and promote prosperity among the people. 22. In any case the Sta^e is now free from any European advisory officials, the administration is set and uno.er the full control of Saiyid Said, President of the Council of Ministers, the finances are balanced and in two or three years time outstanding debts will have been j&amp;f paid oif# 23. The desire of the Government of India to see the7. f State standine on its own feet as an inde^enden4 Arab jprinci- pality is now at last realised and it is ^i^iily desira' le that no move be made which, mi^ht tend to discourage in any way those who are now responsible for the administration 01 the State.

You v/ired yesterday to the effect that he was never informed 'by the Council thfct his resignation had 'been accepted by them. How, although, T have only met Hedgcock for a few days and'liked him personally, I 'be^in to think that his treatment of the Council &amp;nd me in this matter leaves something to 'be desired. To be brief; I arrived on the 6th, interviewed the Council on the 7th, when they -jave a verbal consent to accepting Hedgcock's resignation, wrote to them on the 8th end received their reply on the 14th Stying they would do as we asked them. 2. On the 12th, i.e. four days after my writing to the Council and knowing all about what had occurred and thst their answer was only a question of days, he rsked if he might go end put up his own case at Simla. I naturally did not wish to stop him, so I said he could go provided the Council sgreed and provided he returned by the boat of the 23rd or at latest that of June 30th. I also told him that I had put the date of termination of his services at June 30th and that he would be informed when he returned. On June 12th he left. On June 23rd and June 30th we all duly turned out on board the mail steamers to meet Hedgcock, without any result. Later, on the 30th I got a letter from him dated at Simla saying he was going to Eushire by fast mail on the 5th. On July 2nd Saiyid Said received a wire from Hedgcock from the Bristol Hotel, Karachi, asking for authorisation to go to Eushire to which he replied on the 3rd 'Council cannot authorise going to Bushire H . 3. Tow, Hedgcock says he has not been informed. By what merns, may I ask, does he suppose the Council could have informed him? In order to reach here on the 23rd he would Major T.C.Fowle, C.B.E., Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Grulf, Iushire.v( 2. n heve left Simla e .Lout the i7th, not arriving 'by the t ship it v &amp; q concluded thut he wls on the v/ay to catch that arriv ing on the 30th. yhy did he not inform the Council (a) of his address and (b) of the probatle duration of his 'stay in Simla^ f 4. The Council have been treated rather shabbily by him and this is not an occasion when the issue can be evaded by these quibbles. The Council have now written to Bushire, as being the first fixed address they have had, informing him that his resignation has been accepted from June 30th. 5. '.Thile on this subject I would like to say that Kr» Howell's letter to Colonel Biscoe implies that the reason for acceptin 0 Hed^cock's resignation was his method of attacking the Levy Question which was characterised as 'tactless 11 and 'impetuous'. I have read all the correspondence on the subject and this is not at all my impression. The reason why it was desired to dispense v/ith his services was his attitude towards the Government of India and because he did not work in with the Political Officers in Muscat and Bushire. _ J and the firs.t one , . These two points remain unchanged/is further explained / in my despatch STo.C-lSe, dated the 8th July OtiSKito your address, the Council has accepted them and also his resignation •nd the matter is now closed.

To To begin with, x would liice to maice it clear, that all I have said about him in my former despatches and D.Os is true, the facts have neither been exaggerated nor belittled. &lt;/hat I strongly objected to, and would atiii object to if he did it again, was his attitude towards Government and his idea that he was championing an oppressed State. Since his return, however, three weelcs ago, he has quite changed all that and spares no pains both to do his worJc (at present investigation ef the Levy accounts) and to show that' his former ideas about the State being oppressed have been given up. Under these circumstances^nd if he continues like this in future^there is no reason why he shouldn't stay on. His expe rience would be valuable to the State and in case of Saiyid Said^ sickness or anything^there should be someone to keep things going. In any case now that he regrets what he has done and has learnt his lesson, i^or one^have nothing more against him and, if he carries on m future as he is at present there will be no more complaints against him. It was my duty to bring up everything against him, so that Government my know exactly what they are doing and if in future there should be any more trouble over Hedgcock then it will not be possible for anyone to contend that his former actions were not reported. Saiyid Said, this morning, said that the Council are in different The Hon'ble I'Ajor T.C.Fowle, C.B.E., Political Resident in tne lersian Gulf, Bushire.2. indifferent, they have no official relations with HedgcocJc and they do^t mind if he reniains here, and if he is to 'be reinstated or his resignation to be cancelled, then, they want oflpi«l intimation to this effect before he can work for the State. As I have bruught to notice all that Hedgcock has done or said which I considered wrong and as some extracts from my letters have been forwarded to the Government of India, I hope that a copy of this letter may also be forwarded to them so that all the weight of judgment may not be against him. /zq ,E- Air . -r il Confidential &gt; B«0 *Ko» 527 -3 of 1931* British Residency, Bushire, the 24th August 1931, clrf i 1 il v • • • • #lth reference to correspondence ending with your telegram Ho»2072-S of 18th August 1931, I enclose a copy of a demi-official letter yo.C«183 of 15th August 1931 which I hare just received from Alban• 2. 1 am afraid that Alban is a little temperamental in his views* His letter lto«C«156 of dth July 1931 was very strongly expreflsed, not only in the extracts - paragraphs 18 and 20 - which I sent you under ngr j D»0« S o*445«S of 20th July 1931, but « as far as it concerned Hedgcock and the post of Financial Adviser generally * in its whole tone, as will be seen from paragraphs 15-23 of the complete copy which I now send you.

Oning to the acute financial stringency in the State drastic economies have been made in the Levy as detailed in my letter quoted above* These economies muat continue until the State bees more prosperous days* But economies which are practicable for a temporary period, particularly in regard to the maintenance of an armed force# may not be possible as a permanency* The question therefore which has to be decided is how much of these economies can stand as a permanent measure? Once this question has been answered a definite Levy budget can be laid down which the litate will be expected to meet to the extent that its finances permit* I explained this aspect of the case to Oaptain Alban and asked hiiu to give his views accordingly* To take the various items in the Levy budget one by one* (w U. b' 1 a •.

He uould appear to favour an officer not actually in (xovernment service, but with an experience of other Arab countries, and suggests a sea scale of pay similar to that drawn by Captain Parke, Commandant of Police at Bahrein* While, howeveri the suggestion, contained in my letter iio «623-S of 23rd septemlwir ^ (which personally I think is the most suitable, taking all the circumatances into consideration) , that an economy might be effected by one officer. Captain Alban, holding both the points of Commandant and that of financial Adviser, is uder the consideration of Government, it is hardly worth while entering into the pros and cons of other schemes# (b) Pay of Hon Commiesioned Officers and rank and file fhe reduction in the pay of won Coi^missioned Officers is as follo^ss* A.

Unless the State between now and the end of the year ( which is also the Uuscat financial year ) 9 continues to suffer serious loss in reYenue I think any further reduction in pay should be postponed until 1st January 1932. If it is decided that a further reduction (Kate C.} should be zaade with effect from that date then (a) either the whole Levy can be put on scale those men who do n jt agree being given of course the option of resigning, or (b) new fiecruits can be enlisted at rate C while those already serving can continue to do so at rate B* If (a) is decided on then an increase in the ration ratei(paragraph 9 below), might be made as a compensation* 9« Rations # (paragraph 18 of ay letter). The Muscat Levy ratione f Captain Alban explains, consist of ii lbs. atta per man a day the cost of which is about Ks.l/l4/- per man monthly* The provision of Hs *3000a under this head in the Levy budget is therefore sufficient* The ration rate is by no means high and an increase in certain circumstances ( see paragraph S (b) above ) might be considered. PtLu*. II 10. Arms and .Ammunition , ( paragraph 19 of my letter). w I From Captain - Iba^s report it appeare that the present arms and ammunition of the Corps are as follows^- a 2 i ft luX^ Maxim guns* Lewis guns. ar&lt; 711• Mark # _ '8?! ^ vl. Mark VI. 40 6 110 41,000. 73,000. not 2 as previously reported. Captain Alban does not mention how many Mark VI there are but as the Corps normal strength is 150,presumably it is the balance between that number and 40* (&amp;/ •••5- la) Captain /aban agrees that the Aaxim guns are old and should be replaced as funds permits As replacement he su^j«» gests 4 Vickers ^laxlxas. On grounds of econouv# portability, and uniformity of armament necessary In such a small Corps, 1 would suggest an equlTalent number of i^ewls guns instead of the Vlokers liaxims* i suggest tlmt the ralson d'etre, etc. of the Corps might be explained to the General Staff, who perhaps would be good enough to give the benefit of their adrice on this point, which of course is a technical one. (b) Rifles. Captain Alban also agrees that the Corps should be rearmed with the Hark VII rifle as funds permit. (c) Amunltlon. Captain Alban f s estimates for the Corps, are as follows;- Mark VII Uaxlm Gun reserve of 10 9 000 per gun,for 3 guns-30 9 000 • • Lswls • • - 5,000 11 •# • 1 gun • 5,000 - Rifles 11 ' 200 'rifle for 40 rifles - 8,000 43,000 • * ilaxlm Gun Practice' 1 1,000 11 gun,for 3 guns- 3,000 • • Lewis ^ ' 1,000 ' • , ^ X gun - 1,000 • • Rifles 11 ' 100 'rifle for 40 rifles- 4.000 51,000 In hand To be purchased .. 10,000 ^ ost ® Ks. l,060/» Captain Alban recommends for financial reasons that the purchase be made next year and not this. I concur. the KAtfC VI. As already noted J&gt;alance is 73,000. Captain Alban states that the average consumption per annum on Range Practice will be 7,000, and so no further stock Is required, nor Is It advisable to try to obtain more of this ammunition as It Is old and the proportion of misfires Is high. I concur. * (d) On the general subject of trie supply of ammunition Captain Alban points out that It Is better to keep small stocks and replenish often 9 than to keep large ones, as local climatic conditions lead to rapid deterioration. He suggests that some ...■ one organt»atlon ie noo«»»«iry whereby on deepetoi; oi ft ',ele G nim, eey &gt; t» .,uetfca / rsena-li mamunltion could in an eotergency ba deep&amp;tohed iinuedlately and Itsraialltles oomtleted later.

Your demi-official letter F 35-N/31 dated 14th October. I am of opinion that Alhan should combine posts of Financial Adviser and Commandant of Levies for the present. Although much has 'been done to improve finances and Syed Said is dis- -playing much zeal and energy, coming year will 'be a difficult one. Date harvest has 'been 'bad, and increase in Indian tariff has seriously affected exports. Budget is now 'being prepared . Alhan gets on exceedingly well with Syed Said who will certainly need guidance at this juncture, and Alhan should have official position entitling him to give it, and it is of great importance that future ruler should he tact fully handled. I suggest that as act of courteey State should he informed that arrangement is provision- -al and will he discussed 'by me with Council during my forthcoming tour. I anticipate however that it will he necessary to keep Alhan there for ahout a year. Fowle does not now intend to go on leave till autumn of 1932 or spring of 1933. i tiope you will he ahle to send me an officer as Under-Secretary before I proceed on tour as 1 shall have to leave Secretary f behind and it is very necessary to have one British ^Officer with me. Hesident. (W. 2&gt; JPriYate and Personals British Reflidenoy 9 Bushire, the 29th October 1931. Thanks for the Interesting letters you hare sent me* As I only got back to Bushire this morning, you must forgiTe a hurried reply. I will write at greater length later. Firstly, I must congratulate you on the good work you hare accomplished at Uuscatt and I am delighted to hear that Saiyid Said is doing so well under your adrLce and guidance. I have sent him a message through Major Fowle, which I hope will please him. I hare decided to defer a decision regard ing measures to be taken at 3ur until I have heard the result of Saiyid Said* s third Tisit, in ,, Penzanoe ,, . The mere fact that on three occasions he travelled in a sloop must enhance his prestige enormously and show the Arabs that we are behind him; I trust that no more drastic measures, to which it is very difficult to get the assent of the Government of India, will be necessary* I must comment briefly on soiae of the views expressed by you in your private letters to me and in your of 3rd October* Z do not think the latter gave such a fair picture of exactly what happened regarding the retrench ment scheme which you refer to as being M baulked** by Captain 4to&gt;lker backed by the Political Agent* This is not correct* Walker had agreed to Hedgcook , s out though very reluctantly and subject to certain reservations* Major Fowls had also agreed* I then arrived on the scene* Hedgcock had been in the place exactly a month, and the figures that he produced were largely based on hypotheses. I therefore decided that it ... /.Alb an, Muscat•it would be preferable to go alow until we had some more definite data to go on and reduoed the out in the firet instance, but promised that ooneideration would be giTen to a further cut should the necessity for it be erident. After this and up to the time I left we oould not get anything out of the Financial Adviser in the way of figure®. That is exactly what happened and if anybody interfered with the retrenehment scheme it was nyself and neither Captain Walker nor Major Fowle, and in Tiew of the fact that Hedgoock had only Just arrived and knew nothing about the State my aotion was obrioualy a reasonable one* 1 am recommending to GoTernment that you should stay on as Financial Adviser and Commandant of the Levies, and that . as an act of courtesy the State should be informed that this arrangement is provisional until I have bad an opportunity of discussing the matter with them, which I hope to have in about a month*s time. Saiyid 3aid must have some one to guide him at the present Juncture and X am quite sure that you are the man to do It, so I hope you will accept the appointment, at any rate for about a year, and 1 am confident that you will find Major Powle very easy to gst on with. You mention that you have been writing privately to ^ylie about Muscat affairs. Please do not do so again. On oertain occasions in order to save time the Government of India send copies of official dsapatohes addressed to the Resident direct to Muscat, and he is if there is a real hurry told to send a copy of his repi^ direct to India.

From your letter it appears that the total amount which he should receive is Hs.1735/- per mensem. r You state that with reference to our conversation on the subject, you wired to the Hobble the Resident the summary of our verbal reply (para 3) for which we thank you. noted the Resident's reply to you as described in (para 5} and thank His Honour for the same.

But we wish that this matter be kept pending the arrival of His Honour at Muscat when we shall have the pleasure of meeting and discussing with him this and other matters.2 As ^ointed out to you and ss it is not hidden :rom the Hon^le the Resident and yourself, the financial condition of the State of the Sultan of Muscat and Omsn is it present more serious than anticipated, and it is due t .&gt; the decrtaoe in the imports and exports this year.

Sir, I have the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with Government of India telegram Mo. 2808-S of 17th November 1931 regarding the appointment of Captain Alban as Financial Adviser and Commandant of Levies at Mus cat • 2. In their telegram No.1630-8 of 30th October, the Government of India approved of this appointment provided the State Council concurred, and I therefore instructed the Political Agent to obtain the 'views of the Council regarding this matter. I was informed in reply that the Council had raised some objection to the proposal on financial grounds but stated they would like to postpone their final opinion until the matter had been discussed with me. 3. I therefore asked Saiyid Said at Karachi to let me know frankly his views on the subject, he said that the Council fully realised the necessity fbr a financial Adviser forfor some time to come and also Captain Allan's apecial qualifications for the post and for that of GoMnandent ol the Levies: further he agreed that the arrangement proposed was an economical one from the point oi view ox ihe otate, and actually effected a saving of some Rs.800U in the amount that they proposed to provide in the budget tor the t orth- cnming year for both appointments# ue j owevci aslced tiiat # if possihle, Captain Alhan should not take up the appoint ment till Ihe 1st January 1932» He said that the State Jnad in October last jpeid Rs« 30,000 towards the Government of India loan and that he was trying very hard to find the balance of about Rs. 13,000 due this year, and also to pay off the sum of Rs. 11,000 due to the Bombay dockyard, and that the State had not contemplated that they would be called upon to meet Captain Alben ' s pay for two months this year# At the same time he enquired how long Captain Alban would hold the appointment, and I gained the impression that, while Saiyid Said was very glad to have the benefit of Captain Alban's advice and assistance to tide him over the present financial crisis and stabilise the tinances ol tne State, he was anxious as soon as this had been done, to dispense altogether with the services of a Financial Adviser and to take the control of the purse into his own hands. I informed him that Captain Alban had already been out for about two years and that I contemplated his holding the appointment for a year or 18 months. 4, in order to meet tiaiyid Said^ wishes I therefore suggested to the Government of India that Captain Alban should revert to the post of Under Secretary and accompany me during my forthcoming tour, at the conclusion of which I would • • •would leave him at Muscat, and this proposal has been approved. Captain Alb an has now returned to Bushi re and reverted to his former post. 5. When I left Karachi, however, Saiyid Said accompanied me to the aerodrome, which is about halt an hou^s drive. Said Taimur had then definitely tendered his abdication, and Saiyid Said naturally regards himself as the prospective ruler, and he discussed with me in general terms the question of ministers to assist him in running the State arid, to my surprise, took up a very different line regarding the question of the financial Adviser. He emphasised the great difficulty of finding a suitable officers in the State, and said that particularly in respect of the finances he had no one whom he could trust or who had the requisite knowledge and experience to administer them satisfactorily: that himself had many other pre-occupations and could not devote much time to financial details, and he thought therefore that for many years to come the State would have to ask the Government of India to assist them with the loan of a suitable officer. I ga ned the impression from this conversation that so long as he was merely President of the Council Saiyid Said was anxious to dispanse with the services of the financial Adviser at an tvtur early date, but titaack that, in the ordinary course, he will become Sultan he realises that his position will be very different and that he will have many other duties to perform, and he is therefore most anxious to obtain a British officer to look after the finances and supervise the general administration whenever he may be away. However, that question does not arise at present, and it suffices that Saiyid ..•-4- Saiyid Said welcomes Captain Allan's appointment in the dual capacity of financial Adviser and Commandant of the Leries. I personally consider the appointment an excellent one owing to Captain Albans previous experience in both posts and personal zeal and energy. He will take up the appointment early in January* 6. I recommend that Captain Alban should draw his grade pay in the Political department plus his overseas pay plus Rs« 200/- per mensem ae Commandant of Levies plus R b .200/' per mensem as Financial Adviser. The State will also have to pay the usual pension and passage contributions. Saiyid Said informed me that he agreed to these terms. The appointment should be tenninable by three months' notice on either side.
