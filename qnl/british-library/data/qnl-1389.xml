Po LTTICAL D e PART-MEXr. Trom, COLONEL 11. PHAYRE, C. B. Political Superintendent on the Frontier of Upper Sind. To, THE COMMISSIONER IN SIND, KU REACHE E. Jacobahad, Sth November 18G9. Sir, Tlie time having nearly arrived for carrying ont the orders of His Excel lency the Viceroy in Council, as directed in the Government of India letter No. 879, dated 25th June last, I have the honor to submit for consideration the following views as to the aim and scope of the proposed alterations in our arrangements on this part of the Prontier, in connection with the objects detailed in the 8th para, of Mr. Seton Karr's letter. 2. The accompanying sketch map shews the tract of country under refer- „ , rp. yv i i , . ence : viz. the hilly area included between Deyra Note—The Kandahar tern- ' J &gt; ^ tm-y of Seebee and Kujjuck is Gazee Khan and Dadur, (at the foot of the Bolan of loiu . sl excepted. Pass) by route of Barkhan and Mundahee on the north. The Sind Frontier Districts on the south, Cutchee on the west, and Deyra Gazee Khan districts on the east. 3. I would submit that the geographical position of this tract with reference to our border interests, as well as our communication with the Affghan highlands, either by the Bolan, or direct from Deyra Gazee Khan, establishes its political and strategical importance ; more particularly the northern and western portions of it, inhabited by the Mundahee Murrees. 4. In time of war it might be necessary to use the direct route from Deyra Gazee Khan to Dadur through Barkhan, Tull, Chotealee, &amp;c. ; at all events it is highly desirable that we should know more of that tract than we do ; and as the Mundahee Murrees are by far the most troublesome section ot that tribe, any Political and Military arrangements that failed to provide for civilizing, and if necessary, coercing them, would, I submit be faulty and liable to break down.( 2 ) 5. The boundaries of the Goerchanees, Lasharees, Keytranees, Murrees, and Boogtees are roughly shewn. Their accuracy or otherwise, however, must be verified by local enquiry. 6. Cutchee is the extensive plain tract lying to the westward of the Murrees and Boogtees. It is the eastern portion of it, extending from Dadnr to Shahpoor, that is so frequently overrun with impunity by the Mundahee Murrees and other plunderers. Caravans travelling from Affghanistan are generally plundered in the northern part of it between Bagh and Dadur. 7. Nominally the Murrees and Boogtees are within the scope of His Highness the Khan of Khelat's rule, but so far from his exercising any real power over them, he has hitherto been unable to protect his own territory in Eastern Cutchee from their murderous and predatory attacks. 8. I would respectfully submit that there are equally urgent Political, Military, and Commercial reasons, for our using every effort to civilize and reform these restless neighbours. 0. I use the expression civilize, because it has been shewn in former reports that they are quite prepared to accept civilizing influences ; the Chiefs and headmen themselves, of both the Murrees and Boogtees, having asked us to advance our outposts into their territory for the purpose of putting a stop to their internecine feuds, and thus to afford each tribe an opportunity of cul tivating its own excellent lands. Moreover, as tribal rulers, each asks for coun tenance and support in coercing sections of their own followers who may insist upon disturbing the general peace, by misconduct. 10. The fact is that these Murree and Boogtee Chiefs, the former par ticularly, are placed in a very delicate position, which well deserves our favor able consideration. 11. They see plainly, that eastward as regards the Punjaub, and westward as regard Cutchee and the Bolan Pass, they have naturally incurred relations and responsibilities towards the British Government, which they cannot avoid if they would : and they foresee, that sooner or later, their lawless followers must cease to be obnoxious not only to ourselves, but to our neighbours and allies ; or else they will assuredly draw down severe measures upon the tribes collectively ; hence their expressed desire, through our aid, to establish firm tribal Government, so as to avoid giving offence to us. 12. Other reasons also have prompted this desire. They have witnessed the improved condition of the Belooch, who have lived under our border ad ministration for the last twenty years ; and being well aware of the thriving and steadily increasing trade in cattle and grain that exists between the Pun jaub, Upper Sind, and Cutchee, they begin to understand the value of such highly fertile tracts as the Shum, Murrow, and Pat plains, &amp;c. which conjointly offer to their industry a rich culturable area of about 700 square miles. 13. Their urgency therefore in seeking through our aid to enjoy the same privileges of peace and quietness that their brethren within our border do, in order that they may cultivate these valuable lands, is not to be wondered at ;( 3 ) particularly as they know the boon to be beyond their reach without the actual presence of troops to overawe the unruly ; and of an English Officer to advise them how to lay the foundations of, and carry out, their work of reform. Id.. I would here explain that our Upper Sind Belooch, just alluded to, viz. Boogtees, Doombkees, Jekranees, Joomalees, Kosas, Boordees, Oomranees, and Muzarees, are the same warlike race as of oldj the only difference in them being that they are now under control, and have no reason for plundering, being w ell off. 'Without constant care, however, they would soon relapse into their old habits, and will I think continue liable to do so during the present generation, if neglected. 1 j . 1'or this leason I could not, in connection with the objects under — discussion, recommend the withdrawal of anv of the Soee. . Kusmore. outposts noted in the margin, which have in their r To j- rear the dense jungles of Boordeka, extending- from oiinree# Goranaree. K-ilsmorG for somo 30 ihi I gs soutli-WGSt to ths n^lit bank of the Begaree Canal, and are inhabited by portions of the Belooch tribes abovenamed. In their immediate front those outposts have the Boogtee hills, where the greater part of that tribe still live. So long as the latter behave themselves properly (which they generally do), free intercourse between them and their brethren inside our border is permitted, but at the beginning of this year, I found it quite necessary to order the outposts to patrol to their rear in the Boordeka jungles, as well as to their front, in order to remind all, of the actual presence of troops, and that some cattle-lifting and acts of criminal violence that had taken place must cease. These measures, combined with a few convictions at the Quarter Sessions have, I am happy to say, had the desired effect. 16. I trust it may appear clear from this that though, in order to ad\ ance a line of posts I might reduce and convert the present outposts into supports, I could not withdraw them altogether, without endangering the peace and good order of the whole border; inside as well as outside our ter ritory. This point will be referred to when discussing the detailed military arrangements which it is proposed to make. 17. Similarly, with regard to the Murrees, they will not obey their Chiefs properly, until they see that the latter have it in their power to punish them. They are at present at peace with the Boogtees, owing to our influence and advice ; one case of cattle-lifting however may bring that to a sudden end and cost a score of lives. This truce moreover has not admitted of either side cultivating their extensive outlying lands. 18. Under all the circumstances brought forward, I would submit that a conciliatory policy towards them is preferable to either a neutral or an intimi- datory one, so long as it will answer the object sought. The latter was tried about eleven years ago nen Colonel Sir Henry Green arranged for a force of( 4 ) Brahooes under His Highness the Khan of Khelat, in person, to march into the Murree hills for the purpose of punishing the tribe. The Murrees never faced this force, but fled before it into the distant nothern ranges. They were severely punished and impoverished by a large quantity of their grain, and about 8,000 head of their cattle being captured. The Chiefs eventually came into the camp, and tendered their allegiance to His Highness the Khan, beg ging for mercy, which was extended to them on promise of good behaviour. The entire force was then withdrawn, and the result was, that the tribe being left to itself, soon forgot its severe lesson, and relapsed into former excesses ; the Chiefs being quite unable to restrain their starving followers. 19. My object in quoting this instance, is to show that the effect of even a successful compaign soon wears off with these tribes, unless constantly reminded of it by the actual presence of troops against them ; and that even a conciliatory and highly liberal policy, such as we have under contemplation, would utterly fail without that support, because the greater part of each tribe, being under little or no moral control, would soon succeed in re-opening old feuds. 20. I have thus endeavoured to state what I submit may be fairly urged in favor of the proposed measure in a Civil and Political point of view. Kesting upon the broad basis of a desire to serve the real interests of others as well as our own, I venture to hope for its successful issue if carefully carried out. The concurrence of His Highness the Khan of Khelat will I feel sure be readily accorded to th« independent arrangements, should the Government be pleased to sanction them. Indeed, they will tend to promote His Highness' interests and those of his subjects in Cutchee, quite as much as they will those of the Hill tribes themselves. It will however be carefully explained to His Highness that any arrangements we may make will not supersede the necessity for his taking precautionary measures for the safety of Eastern Cutchee, which, if not defended by a line of outposts, may prove too great a temptation for the Mundahee Murrees, and led to excesses which would defeat the whole plan. 21. With regard to the Military arrangements which it has from time to time been proposed to make, both by the Punjaub and Sind Frontier Officers, in support of the above object, I would summarise them by stating that they aim at establishing a cordon of posts on the east, south, and west sides of the tract in question, as shewn by the dotted red line in the map. 22. The positions proposed to be held are :— The necessity for each will form a part of the enquiry about to take phice. 1st.—Luggaree Barkhan. 2nd.—A central point in the Shum plain. 3rd.—Dajra Beebruk. 4th.—Sungseela. 5th.—Phoolajee, or any point near it.( 5 ) For the remaining fifty or sixty miles between Phoolajee and Dadur, His Highness the Khan of Khelat would be requested to provide a line of posts, about 10 miles apart. 23. The principal, and most important post of all, would be that in the Shum plain ; where, and on the neighbouring' Maree mountain, during the hot season, a Political Officer would reside. 24 It would be premature to enter into further details at present. I beg however respectfully to assure the Government that every point noted for enquiry shall be thoroughly sifted, and a full report made thereon. 25. I shall be quite ready to march when the present Sessions at Jacobabad are concluded, which will be towards the close of the present month. I mention an early date for the march, owing to the necessity of my having to attend at the High Court in Bombay, probably in February next, or whenever the spring Sessions may take place, in connection with the trial of the Earop3an public servant in Upper Sind, who stand accused of havinsr committed criminal breach of trust as such. 26. As one of the charges against John Barron is for stealing my Tosha- khana allowance of this year, amounting to Rs. 2,000, which sum in Currency notes has been traced by the numbers of the notes to his Banker's account, 1 would solicit that I may be allowed to expend a similar amount in presents to Chiefs during the exploring expedition under report. I know of no other expenses likely to be incurred, except it be for feeding such Chiefs with a few followers who will of necessity accompany us. 27. A copy of this letter will be forwarded to the Secretary to Government in the Punjaub, and as soon as I have, in communication with the Punjaub Government, and Colonel Graham, the Commissioner of Deyra Gazee Khan, fixed a date that will be mutually convenient, we will proceed to carry out the orders with which we are charged, I have the honor to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, K. PHAYKE, Colonel, Political Superintendent on the Frontier of Upper Sind.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100024102474.0x000001_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>Mss Eur F126/22, ff 1-3</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024102474.0x000001</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>Mss Eur F126/22, ff 1-3</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Letter No.1579 of 1869 from Colonel Robert Phayre, C.B., Political Superintendent on the Frontier of Upper Sind, Jacobabad to Sir William Lockyer Merewether, the Commissioner in Sind, Kurrachee [Karachi]</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1869/1869</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-10-09T16:10:58</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>3 folios</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>Letter submitting Phayre's views on the aim and scope of proposed alterations in arrangements for the Upper Sind part of the frontier.The letter refers to a sketch map (which is no longer enclosed) that detailed the area of the frontier in question and showed the boundaries of the various tribes there; and highlighting its political and strategic importance, particularly in times of war.The letter also discusses those tribes outside of British control, including the Murrees and Boogtees who have expressed a wish to benefit from British influence in order to end tribal feuds and better opportunities for cultivating their own lands.The letter also outlines Phayre's objections to proposals to withdraw some of the frontier outposts, and suggesting that some could instead be converted to supports for other outposts which could be done without endangering the peace and good order of the whole border area.The letter goes on to cite actions which have been taken against the Murrees in the past, and demonstrating how the effects of these actions have not lasted and why more permanent reminders, including the stationing of troops, is required in order for anything to have a long term effect. Phayre also outlines his proposals for military positions that would be required to undertake such actions.The letter concludes with Phayre informing Merewether that he is ready to march once his work at Jacobabad is complete and that he would prefer to depart earlier for the march as he may be required to attend the High Court in Bombay in connection with the trial of John Barron, a public servant in Upper Sind accused of a criminal breach of trust.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024102474.0x000001#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
