Moral effect of Dartmouth’s \lsit may also enable Sultan to exact terras of peace from Imam.

Addressed Resident Bushire Repeated to Foreign &amp; ADMIRAL Poll t ical A; ent 66 .* I have the honour to forward herewith the copy of a letter No. 1292-D dated 12th March 1914 from the Honourable the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, in which certain principles are laid down for our guidance in regard to the creation of a Levy Corps at Masqat* You will notice that my views have been called fo£ with regard to those principles and further that the report calledfor in the telegram from the Government of India in the Foreign Department No. 493-S dated 4th November 1915 X* (copy of which was forwarded to you under this office endorsement No. 332fdat©d 5th November 1913) is now to be submitted with detailed estimate of the cost involved in the scheme. / ^ 2. In your telegram No. dictated 2oth March, I have oo- served with satisfaction that a favourable occasion was seized on by you to suggest, the notion of His Highness raising a disciplined corps of his own and that His Highness appeared to regard it with favour* 3. I have now the honour to request that you will be so good as to submit a Scheme for the creation of a Levy Corps on the lines laid down with detailed estimate of the cost involved. From the general tenour of the letter under reference, it would appear essential that you should take HisHis Highness into your confidence and, without troubling him with unnecessary detail, satisfy yourself that he is in accord with you on the Scheme in its geheral lines* 1 shall also be glad of a full expression of your views, which will naturally at the same time be to a large extent coloured by those of His Highness the Sultan on the general principles laid down. 4. It is perhaps hardly necessary to point out that the use of the word ”nominal w which occurs S times in paragraph 2 would have to be carefully avoided in discussions with His Highness out of regard for his susceptibilities* I suggest that its meaning might be conveyed by your explain ing to His Highness that naturally all matters of pay, arms and equipment, would be dealt with by the Commanding Offi cer, and that before officers, British or Native, and instructors lent from His Majesty’s Service could be em ployed in hazardous undertakings or on unusual duties, it would be important for His Highness to obtain the consent of Government presumably through the Political Agent for the time being. 5. You will be addressed separately on the question raised in paragraph 3 of the letter under reference. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant, Major, Offg: Political Resident in the Persian GulfA copy of a letter No. 1292-D dated 12th March, 1914, from the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bnshire. I am directed to invite a reference to the telegram from the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, No. D.S. 67, dated the 21st January, 1914, in timating that it has been decided to consider separately the questions (a) of the creation of a Levy Corps at Masqat and (b) of obtaining an undertaking from His Highness the Sultan of Masqat not to conclude fresh treaties rith For eign Powers without the assent of His Majesty»s Government. 2. It is understood that the primary object of the proposed Levy Corps is to enable the withdrawal of the Indian troops at present garrisoning the towns of Masqat and Matrah and raised force sufficient to assert his authority, defend his capital against rebellious tribesmen and furnish a reserve from which detachments may be drawn to garrison such of His Highness f inland forts as he may hereafter recover* There is, from an international point of view, no objection to the creation of such a force on the basis proposed by Sir 1913, provided that the Corps is nominally a Masqat force and that the officers by whom it is commanded, whether British or Indian, are nominally in the Sultan’s service. But unless the Corps is carefully handled it is not free from risk. If the Corps should be imposed on the Sultan against his will and he neither takes part in its work nor •accepts responsibility for it, he will lose repute and authorit y with the tribal chiefs and will not be likely to re-establish satisfactory relations with them. His consent and&amp; and goodwill are therefore essential. Again, unless the territorial limits within which the force may operate are strictly defined it may be tempted to embark upon hazardous adventures and may suffer a reverse that might entail the despatch of a regular force from India. The Corps should be under the same restrictions against taking the offensive against fche enemy in the interior as have been placed upon the Indian garrison. I am to request that you will kindly submit your views on the above with the report called for in the telegram from the Government of India in the Foreign Department No. 493-S dated the 4th November 1913, and a detailed estimate of the cost involved in the scheme. 3. I am also to request a fuller expression of your views on the question of treaties in the light of the observations made in the Foreign Office letter of the'23rd January 1914, a co-oy of which was forwarded to you with the endorsement i from the Government of India in the Foreign ohd Political Department No. 1039-D (Confidential) dated the 24th Febru ary 1914.1 72. Levy Corps. Your letter 930 of 29th March. In discussing scheme with H.H.,Sultan is almost certain.to refer.to question of meeting its cost.

A talk over the situation with his French colls ague might possibly elicit useful information. If he should report by telegram result.

As regards (1) H.H said that recent proclamation had nothing whatever to do with Levy Corps Scheme which he was still most anxious to see carried out under, the supervision of British officers. H.H. explained that his present.household A city guards 9 atout 500 men, we re unreliable lot* enlisted fry his father from Yemen A elsewhere A that their officers were altogether corrupt* It was,he said, in cider to obtain local men to re place these that proclamation was published. H.H. proposes to enlist 200 selected men in place of 300. H.H^said he had al ready writtenJto India for the services of a pensioned Indian officer of the Indian Army to be in charge of them. H.H.how- evertadded that there had been very meagre-response, to proclam ation A scarcely 20 men had volunteered for service. H.H. does 11 not wish L vy C rps to be employed in any way within palace pre cincts-or as city guards,for which duties he desires.to make his own arrangements as heretofore. I. thinK that in this matter j i his wishes should be respected. asxed that Levy CgipA should be, for the present, not more Than 300 strong including 2 British officers A he asked me to submit details of Scheme as soon as possible. I should be glad if O.C.MeKran Levy Corps could be asked as soon as possible to send me papers that would assist me A serve as guide. As regards (2),I communicated Gov. of India’s views as to. coll ective significance of points mentioned in your telegram N0.419 of April 5th. and 423 of April 9th. H.H*. said he regretted his action in corresponding)w??&amp; Govemor of Busdire. As» re- ^ gaids Lingah Agent mixing himself up ia local politics H.H. j said he would reprimand Agent A dismiss him if any further com plaints were received about him. H.H. denied having tried.to enlisted Afghans through chokidaf of Grey Co.. He had been2 . unable to obtain information as regards visits of Aziz A Ali.to .to French Consul.

Question of Sultan’s proclamation re afhny already dealt with elsewhere* I note in passing that as it has already 'been reported telegraphically and by letter , it should not have formed part of diary . Foreign have lately remonstrated on length of our monthly diary , so please curtail the ordinary diaries too , confining entries chiefly to matters not worth official report and with regard to matters reported, the very briefest statement of fact , with ^if you like / a note 'elsewhere reported'. I wrote to Foreign an 25th April and can reasonably expect reply next mail. I will let you know by telegram, whether they approve ftpur corresponding dire ct with Commandant, Levy Corps , Uakran or not. I imagine that , as Makran Levy Corps has been so often referred to in this connection , it# is a Corps of this kind that is contemplated and should proceed on those lines. As the idea so far is to confine its use to defence of Masqat and Matrah enclave and so relieve Indian troops, I think it should be infantry with^ a machine gun detachment • I imagine that we shall shortly get definite instructions . There have been many formidable suggestions put forward and Foreign has so far said little or nothing except that whole situation is under consideration . Your letter forwarding your scheme will offer opportunity for a reminder and you might find it convenient to say that you have been a little embarrassed by the possibilities ad- -umbrafed in my telegram No.425 of 9.4.14 , but have thoughtit safer to stick to the less ambitious scheme sketched in Foreign’s No. 1292 D of 12.3.14. P.S. By the way that letter I think gives you a chance to tick out for a British Commandant on the plea that ay( N.O s might find it difficult to withstand pressing instance by H.H. and remind me of the Saiyid Qasim incident and 70,000 cartridges for the Bani Bu ’Ali. A PPP.S. I had forgotten that you asked whether you should speak to Sultan on subject of his new proclamation . See my telegram No. 531 of 1st May to Foreign repeated to you and scty to yourself No \ certainly not i It is Foreign’s pigeon now and up to them to tell you whether you should do anything or not . Anything you might say now might conceivably conflict with subsequent instrustions that you may receive^ from Foreign and then you are up a tree again. If the matter grows pressing and urgent , there is no objection to your represent- -ing this and asking that urgent instructions may be issued to you but only the very gravest unforeseen emergency would justify you in taking action , without instructions , and you would be bound to report immediately and be prepared to justify your action • On second thoughts I have thought it best to send you a short wire on th e subject but you mustConfidential Docket telegram* From Knox, Resident Bushire.

You will have received Foreign’s warning to Sultan about co-operating with you and hope that this will induce His Highness to reconsider K his rather foolish attitude. I should not be inclined to mfeke the Scheme too elaborate, but whatever you do, don't underestimate cost. It is sure to need modification later on. My idea was a nucleus of Indian sepoys and Non-com missioned officers, Makran Baluchis and Hadhramamt or Hassawi Arabs. About 100 of each.

There can be no objection to your an ticipating this and writing to Commandant. He will probably give you all figures without more trouble but even so, I fear it will involve considerable delay. If you can evolve a scheme with the Bait-al-Falaj people, I am inclined to think it would be better. Rustom Khan would give you an idea of suitable wage for Baluchis serving in Masqat and that would be a fair guide for the other contingents. The varying rations might be a bother.

British troops now quartered there has been under the consicu at ion of the Government of India since October last yeari and though the subjeet was» I understand # informally suggested to the Sultan at the timet His Highness does not seem to have ser iously realised the necessity for such a force until March of the present year # when the recurrence of unrest in the interior and the increased activity of the refeels caused him to give the matter his more serious attention* Until then His Highness appears to have counted on the continued retention of a garri son of British troops at Bait-al-Falaj and to have even enter tained the hope that our troops would be permitted to undertake offensive operations against the enemy in the interior* It was only on learning that the indefinite retention of our troops and their employment in the interior were out of the question that His Highness really realized that his only hope of ever re-establishin fe his authority in the interior lay in the establishment of a disciplined local Corps of his own* Since then f as the telegrams I have sent you from time to time will have shewnt His Highness has in conversation always assur ed me of his earnest desire te see the Levy Corps Scheme carr ied out, and he has invariably laid stress on the point that it should be under the supervision of British Officers, at any rate during its infancy* On the 3rd June last, without troubling His Hignness with un necessary details, I ^rielly outlined the uain points oi a skeleton scheme,which I had prepared, mainly with a view to ascertaining His Highness 1 views as to the composition and strength of the Corps and of the amount ol r ay to oe given to different ran^s* At the same time I too^ the opportunity oi explaining to His Highness the main objects of the Corps,, oein* uided in my remarks by the principles laid down in tne Govern- of India's letter Ko*1292 of 12th. March 1914. I explained that all matters of pay,arms and equipment connected with the Corps would naturally be dealt with by the Officer Commanding3. the Corps and that with regard to the fliOveoients and dispositi a of the troops it would oe important for Kis wishes a-' TiaXurz. of government* In this way Hke general idea of rtise nominal / control A J»jbfiMxOf the Corps was conveyed to His Highness f whOfhowever, offered no comment on it* As regards the cost of the corps His Highness at first demurred somewhat at the jrate of pay sug gested, especially that proposed for the sepoy * but ne finally- agreed to the proposals under this head* The Scheme as a whole at first seemed to stride Kis Highness as bein 0 ratner more elaborate than he had anticipated and he seemed apprehen sive that the cost would probacly be ceyond nis means* His Highness, however, b ave the scheme his provisional approval and at the same time he repeated the request which he nad already J made to me on more than one occasion, that the new Corps should - to use his own expression - w resemble the British troops at mush as ffBg&amp;l&amp;lg Bait-al-Falaj as much as possible ' in order | that 11 the enemy might still continue to regard the force at Bait-al-Falay as troops of the British Government ' the ssoai j moral effect of whose presence there, which His HighneH^i!^t~ most powerful weapon in his hands,would,he feared,be lost oy the substitution of whatmight appear to be a less regular and disc iplined force* Should the present Scheme appear at first sight to be a somewhat elaborate and costly one, the only explanation I can offer is la that I have endeavoured to carry out His Highness 1 wishes in the above respect* My aim nas been to evolve a local force, I less elaborate and costly J- though in no way less effioient- than our regular Indian troops or our Indian Frontier Militias, but more highly organised and equipped than the xa&amp;uiax irregu lar Tri^l Levies of Baluchistan* His Highness being in accord with me on the general lines of Scheme as far as the composition of the Corps was concerned and his verbal consent thereto having ceen secured, it was arrangedthat I should proceed to work out the Scheme in more detail and suDmit a complete Estimate of its cost lor His Highness' further consideration* The attached Estimate is the result* is His Highness nas been away from Mascat for tne |fast 3 wee^s am is still aosent I nave had no opportunity of discussing it with him in its more complete form* Nor 9 indeed f do 1 think it would be expedient to do so until you yourself have had an opportunity of criticising it and sucmitting it to the Govern ment of India for any modifications that may oe considered necessary* 4* I will now deal with the main points of the Scneme that appear to me to oall for remark i~ (i&gt;* British Olfioers* That the supervision of the Cor*.s should ce in the hands of a British Oificer is I thiru essential and it is hoped that tats proposal will meet with approval* A Native Officer in Com mand mi^ht find it dilfioult to withstand any pressure that His Highness might at times attempt to exercise over him* Moreover f the ultimate efficiency and moral tone of the Corps mustfl think f depend entirely on the early training it will rec- - eive in its infanoy f and such training^ can only be carried out to the ^est advantage under the supervision of a I ritish rather than a Native Officer* (ii)* Strength of Cor^s* ^ The strength proposed ( 300 Fighting men ) is that suggested in Sir Percy Cox’s tele 0 ram t No*ld M of 14th*0oto^er 1913#to the Government of India f and -as reported in my telegram No*121 of Ibth*May 1914 to your address- agreed to by H*H*The Sultan* 5 The number is less oy 7b men than the strength of the British garrison now considered necessary for the protection of Mascat and Hatrah* ^ . I venture to think that it represents the minimum strength necessary to efficiently carry out the duties that the Cor^s will be called upon to perform -more especially if f as seems5* required likely, it will ^ to garrison certain outposts in % the interior as well as to find a permanent garrison at Head Quarters* (iii&gt;* Rates of Pav of Eritisn Off ice rs,Indian Ranr* &amp; File* The pay proposed for the British Olficers has been calculated on the assumption that officers of the rarm of Captain and Lieutenant in the Indian Army will be selected for the posts of Comnandant and Adjutant respectively* To their ^ay as such has Haas aided a suitaole addition has been Bade in view of the special nature of the service they will be called on to perform and the extra cost of living in Masoat* Their pay is no doubt a heavy item,amounting, as it does, to Rs* 19,200* on account of pay and Rs* 16,200/ on account of for Pension the Contricut ion/which His Highness will have to pay,making a total of Rs* 55*400/ annually under this head alone* As regards the pay of the Native ranns this has been fixed, as explained in the body of the Scheme, after taxin fo into consideration the unfavourable climatic and other conditions under which the corps will have to serve. The rates of *ay enjoyed by regular troops serving in Oman and tne Gulf and by the Levy Corps serving in Me^ran have also been taxen as a guide, while the amount paid oy His Highness to the Baluchis recently enlisted for service in his Palace and City Guards has also been taken into consideration* The rates now proposed for the new Corps comprise 'Pay', ' Mascat Allowance 11 and ' Compensa/tion for dearness of Rations '• They total considerably less than the pay and allowances enjoyed by the regular troops serving in Oman and tk the Gulf, and -except in a few instances- they are aoout ec*- ual to the rates obtaining in the Mekran Levy Corps* The ' Compensation for dearness of rations ' now proposed is about half of that enjoyed by the regular troops of the Masoat Consulate Guard. No provision has been made in these Estimates for ' Good Ser-6 . Service Pay ,f in the case of Non-CoaiiLlssioned 01iicers 9 or for M Good Conduct Pay ” in the case of Sepo&gt;s. This ^riv- ele^e is enjoyed by the Regular Araiy and by the Znob and MeK- ran Levy Cor^s* The question of granting it to the Masoat Levy Corps will no douct be raised in due course* If event ually it is granted ike it would involve an additional annual app rox i afiat e 1 y expenditure at ranging/from a minimum cost of Rs*144/ after 2 years service to a maxin-uit of Rs*576/ after 4 years in the case Non-CocDJLissioned officei-s on account of Good Service Pay# and in the case of the Sepoy a minimum annual cost «an^in &amp; from Rs* 5264/ after 5 years to a maximum of Rs*9/92 after 10 years on account of Good Conduct Pay* The retaining items under Annual &amp; Recurring Expenditure are fully explained in the oody of the Scheme and call for no fur ther remarx here* Sader M Initial Expenditure ” no provision has been made for ’Buildings 1 cecause in the absence of expert and professional assistance it was found impossible to make any estimate that would ^e reliable* There is no doubt however that the cost of erecting permanent Barracks would oe yery heavy and it would as aauxl ~e advisable to defer embarking on any expenditure on this account until experience has shewn what the actual requirements of the new Corps will be and the type of build ing that would pe mao^most suitable* Some sort of temporary shelter will however be aecessary for the aien during the ex treme heat of the summer and a sum of Rs*2000/ for mat hutSf similar to those erected for the regular troops at Bait al Fa- la jt has been provided* Another item for which no provision has seen made is a Machine Gun» which would undoubtedly be a useful -if not essential- addition to the Corps and one that would certainly find favour with His Highness. As already confidentially reported His Highness nas already purchased 2 Quick-firing Machine Guns which I understand are of a portable type and it is possiblethat His Highness my be willing to place one of these at the disposal of the Corps and thus save any further expenditure on this account. Should this suggestion, hoiever, not meet with approval an estimate of cost unda in this connection will ce submitted 5. As regards the question of how the cost of the Corps is to be met I would mention tnat His Highness has never definitely stated his inability to meet the entire cost him self, but he has on more than one occasion hinted that it would be beyond his means to meet any very large expenditure on this account. Some Idea of the extent to which His High ness seemed prepared to go in this respect may be gathered from a remark he made to me that in his opinion the Zanzibar subsidy would be ,l more than sufficient to cover the cost of the Corps '• As will be seen from these estimates the Zanzibar subsidy would cover only a little over half the pro annual posed cost of the new corps. Half the/cost of the Corps comes to Rs. 7Q2S9/» The Zanzibar subsidy amounts to Rs« 86400. His Highness has never raised the question of the participat- -ion by Government in the expenses of the corps, nor have I pared ever led His Highness to think that Government would be pre-/ to contribute towards its establishment and raaintainanoe. But this question, I think, is bound to come up now,if and when the present Estimate is presented to him. I would therefore ask that the decision of the Government of India in this matter may be obtained and communicated.to me. In this connection it was suggested in Sir Percy Cox's, tele gram, No.15 M. of 14th. October 1915 to the Government of India that the ' cost would have to be a charge on Customs Revenue or on subsidies paid '• Again in your telegram ( as Political Agent Mascat ) No. 216 dated 11th. December 1913 to the Resident i&amp; Bushire it was proposed that half the oost should be paid from and limit--ed to the present subsidy of Rs. J'Zyy/* p'er mensem which Mascat draws as Zanzibar subsidy# .The other half should be paid b&gt; the British Government as an additional subsidy ”• I venture to express my opinion in favour of the latter propo sal. But as the Zanzibar subsidy ( Rs. 8b400/ annually ) covers more than half the annual carat of the corps ( Rs.yo^bP/) I would suggest that the whole of tnat subsidy be contributed by His Highness, and that the balance only ( Rs. 54118/. ) be met by Government. The whole amount ( Rs. 140518/. ) should, I suggest, be placed under the control of the Political Agent hascat who would sanction its disbursexsnt in accordance with an annual Budget which the Officer Conmanding the Corps would submit and which would presumably have to receive His Highness* informal approval. ( Rs. 3b042/.) As regards the Initial Expenditure required the first year, /. this would doubtless have to take the form of a loan to the . Sultan to be repaid by him in instalments either from His Highness* other subsidy of Rs. 8333/5/4. per mensem or from his Customs Revenues. In the latter case, I venture to think, the Government of India - in order to ensure regular payments ^ti^liligjhili otherwise be uncertain - would possibly deem It expedient to suggest to His Highness the advisibility of obtaining on loan the services of British officials for the more profitable management of his Customs Department.

In general accord with the principles laid down in your letter already quo ted and, with some reservations in points of detail, vrtiich I shall diecuss later, I venture to commend them to the favourable consideration of the Government of India* 5* I do not myself see any room for further economies in th© Schcsiae presented by Lieutenant-Colonel Benn i nd there is, for the present at any rate, much force in His Highness 1Highneaa 1 wish that his turbulent •Omani nubj©ct» should continue to regard the new Corps aa British* At the earae tine its oost will bo a heavy burden on the slender financial re sources of His Highness the Sultan of Masqat, and I venture to plead with Government that the principle of half the oost being borne by them nay be admitted* ‘l*he cost may, however, vary in different years and it would save confusion if His were to Highness/surrender at onoe the whole of the Zanzibar subsidy towards t ie cost of the new Corps and Govemr ent render them selves responsible for the balance* As regards the initial expenditure of Kb 30,000 I would recommend that it should be advanced by Government in the firat instance with promise of repayment from the arms traffic subsidy, payment to commence two years after the inception of th® Scheme* Interest at 4$ per annum on the loan would suffice to keep the obligation alive and, at the end of two years, we should be in a moni tion to see whether the Scheme was running well and whether His Highness continued to afford it the full support and encouragement which are so desirable* If such proved to be the case, in consideration of this enlightened attitude and in view of the fact that the Masqat State was paying more than a moiety of the cost of maintenance, it would, in my opinion, be a politic concession to forego the debt alto gether* 4* Should it be deeided to saddle dustoms Revenues with the repayment of this loan, Lieutenant-Colonel Berm suggests the advisability of His Highness obtaining an loon the services of British officials for the more prof table management of the Masqat Customs* Mills apologising for orotruding a purely personal opinion, I may perhaps be permitted to remark that I have never been able to share the enthusiasm displayed in some quarters, for assuming the responsibility for the dis charge of such a difficult and thankless task, as the col lection of the Customs duties of backward and impoverished States. Our methods are expensive and a poor country like MasqatMasqat, with a long straggling seaboard and an indeter minate land frontier and difficult communications between outposts, would hardly pay for them* Add to this that our prestige would suffer from the odium that invariably attach es to the tax-collector* For these reasons I would infinitely prefer to debit the Arms Traffic subsidy with the repayment, If it must be repaid, of the initial expenditure on the Masqat Levy Corps* 5* With regard to the actual details of the Scheme, I would invite a reference to the paragraph 'Enlistment' under II Organisation and Constitution* I have some doubts as to the suitability of Brahuis of Makfcan and the Jhallawan country, Kalat State subjects. They are hiIlmen and, for the first year at any rate of the existence of the Corps, woulc 1 be serving in the torrid heat of the Mattra valley.I yield to no one in my admiration of the many fine qualities of the Brahuis with whom, as Political Agent, Kalat, I was closely associated for many years, but I only met one or two of them at Masqat during ray term of service there, and I am not fully convinced of their fitness to serve in that climate. Lieutenant Quayle has come in with a suggestion that may prove fruitful. He informs me that the 127th Baluchis are endeavouring to get rid of thoir Baluch company, who are mostly Lasharis from the Kachi plains lying to the west of the line of railway between Sibi and JacGhabad. These men, if any, inhabit a country that, in p&amp;int of temperature resembles Masqat and the opportunity of transferring a com pany of trained men, en bloc, seems to good to be lost. I would auggeot that the Political Agent be authorised to ( address the Officer Commanding the 127th Baluchis on the subject, so that they may exa dne together the feasibility of this proposal. Company (a^ might well be formed of this material* Recent proposed developments at Chahbar inclin- me t the belief that some political advantage might accrue from tae enlistmentenlistment of Baluchi a from the Perso-Makran country. I do not altogether favour the proposal to enlist a precisely * similar class of men from the ’Oman littoral as I think that Jthe immediate result would be a number of applications from the many persons who have been kidnapped into slavery there. However desirable the freeing of these men may be from their arab owners, the formation of the new Corps should not be hampered by any considerations of this kind, and we do not want bogus complaints, impossible to prove or disprove, of theft against the new recruits by their arab owners. If, on the other hand, the Commandant or Adjutant of the new Corps were placed in touch with the proposed Political Assistant Chahbar, they would be able to approach men like Islam Khan, Mir Barkat and Saiyid Khan of Oaih and other Baluch chiefs of that part of the ooufatry with not unwelcome proposals and the enlistment of these quondam arms runners would tend to extend our political influence In the district and, to however tx modest a degree, pacify the country. Company (b) might, I think, therefore be recruited from Makranls preferably from Perso-Makran. Company (c) while very desirable, will be the most difficult to raise and train. Somalis could, no doubt, be found in considerable numbers to Judge from the alacrity with which these men enlist on board His Majesty’s ships. But it would be a far greater suocess If we could onlirt the good offi ces of the ’Omani Khalkhs and procure townsmen, not, I think. Bedouin, from the interior. The primary difficulties will be formidable but the arab is intelligent and adaptable add should, in the end, do well. I doubt however if a melange of S malls and Arabs would prosper and one element would, I think, absorb the other In time. I should certainly prefer the ’Omani element. I have carefully examined the remaining proposals of Lieutenant Colonel Benn and can find nothing^wfeich I am not In full accord. I have to add, at his request, to initialinitial expenditure a sum of Rs 1200 for the purchaee of a Maxim gun exclusive of freight and ammunition, advocated on page 6 of his report in hlo opening remarlis under 'Ini tial expenditure'. I consider the provision of this gun a necessity and doubt if His Highness will be at all willing to part with the 2 Q.f. machine guns he has already order ed. The total of 'initial expenditure' will therefore star at Rs 36,242.

Whatever be the class of the intending recruits who come from these towns they will be organised into a standing army and will be fully armed. Who so choses to serve and remain in this organised body, should come forward and present himself to us, so that the selecting officer may see whether an intend ing recruit is fit for service and may also inform him of the pay as well as of the rules and regulations he will be required to follow. And the organisation will be of two kinds, namely, (1) for artillery service and (2) simple infantry, and the intending recruit will be free to make his own choice (as to which of the two services he will join). And we hope and trust that every youth will be impelled by patriotic zeal to come forward for these noble services. No one of an age above 30 years will be accepted by the Government, but men under 30 years of age down to 15 years will be acceptable. Men of free and liberal minds will (we hope) be prompted by their own inclination (to enlist) rather than through the employ ment of force by us or their kith and kin so that this may not be hidden, and salaam. f,u *- V i V“X 4 No. 1580 , dated Bushire, the 24 th May 1914 . ir rom Captain L.

Following is more detailed account of what His Highness said with reference to his action in corresponding]direct with Governor of Bushire : His Highness ex plained that Mulla Husain of Bushire, who I imagine is the Turkish ex Vice-Consul mentioned in your telegram 419 of 8th April and who appears to be a merchant oc-^ casionally employed by His Highness to execute commissions, telegraphed to His Highness to obtain assistance in the matter of the Shiraz gunners. On this His Highness applied to me. The Mulla followed up his telegram with a letter in which he asked His Highness to send him a letter from himself addressed to the Governor of Bushire about the Shiraz gunners. This letter, the Mulla said, he would make use of in the event of our efforts on his behal#4ftihng,^han-hejvouW present it per sonally to the Governor. Then came the difficulties made by the Governor on account of the cigarette incident at Maskat and so the Mulla presented the letter. In the meanwhile your representations had been successful. His Highness led me to understand that he vras not in the habit of correspond ing with the Governor of Bushire and regretted the present instance. G. M Frew, uimla —No C.-178 F D.—13-5-U —7.—E.

Response to Sultan’s proclamation has apparently been so meagre, His Highness has found it necessary to try conscription. On 5th June, day after His Highness had left Maskat for cruise on Nur al Bahar, men under Saiyid Nadir’s orders patrolled the town, forcibly arresting young men for service. Some considerable commotion in the town resulted. Many men are said to have fled from Maskat by sea. A few took refuge in this Agency to escape arrest. As the new order threatened to affect the Naval Contractor’s coolies and thus impede the coaling of His Majesty’s ships I sent my dragoman to Saiyid Nadir with a note asking him for the true facts. Saiyid Nadir has given me an assurance that only loafers and men who are known to have no occupation have been or will be enlisted, and that no one connected with any trade, and certainly no coolies employed in coaling or other work, will be molested. I submit above for your information and will, on His Highness’ return, furnish further report, if necessary.

I have the honour to invite a reference to correspondence ending with your letter No. 1292-D., dated 12th March 1914 on the subject of the proposed Maskat Levy Corps, and to forward herewith a copy of the letter quoted in the margin, under cover of which the Political No. 145, da'ed 29th June 1914. Agent, Maskat, forwards a complete Scheme for the establishment and maintenance of the proposed Corps. 2. Lieutenant Colonel Benn’s carefully considered proposals appear to be, I venture to think, in general accord with the principles laid down in your letter already quoted and, with some reservations in points of detail, which I shall dis cuss later, I venture to commend them to the favourable consideration of the Government of India. 3. I do not myself see any foom for further economies in the scheme pre sented by Lieutenant Colonel Benn and there is, for the present at any rate, much force in His Highness’ wish that his turbulent Omani subjects should con tinue to regard the new Corps as British. At the same tin\p its cost will be a heavy burden on the slender financial resources of His Highness the Sultan of Maskat, and I venture to plead with Government that the principle of half the cost being borne by them may be admitted. The cost may, however, vary in different years and it would save confusion if His Highness were to surrender at once the whole of the Zanzibai* subsidy towards the cost of the new Corps and Government render themselves responsible for the balance. As regards the initial expenditure of Rs. 36,000 I would recommend that it should be advanced by Government in the first instance with promise of repayment from the arms traffic subsidy, payment to commence two years after the inception of the scheme. Interest at 4 per cent, per annum on the loan would suffice to keep the obligation alive and, at the end of two years, we should be in a position to see whether the scheme was running well and whether His Highness continued to afford it the full support and encouragement which are so desirable. If such proved to be the case, in consideration of this enlightened attitude and in view of the fact that the Maskat State was paying more than a moiety of the cost of maintenance, it would, in my opinion, be a politic concession to forego the debt altogether. 4 Should it be decided to saddle Customs Revenues with the. repayment of this loan, Lieutenant-Colonel Benn suggests the advisability of His Highness obtaining on loan the services of British officials for the more profitable manage ment of the Maskat Customs. While apologising for protruding a purely per sonal opinion, I may perhaps be permitted to remark that I have never been able to share the enthusiasm, displayed in some quarters, for assuming the responsi bility for the discharge of such a difficult and thankless task, as the collection of the Customs duties of backward and impoverished States. Our methods are expensive and a poor country like Maskat, with a long straggling seaboard and an indeterminate land frontier and difficult communications between outposts, would hardly pay for them. Add to this that our prestige would suffer from the odium that invariably attaches to the tax-collector. For these reasons I would infinitely prefer to debit the Arms Traffic subsidy with the repayment, if it must be repaid, of the initial expenditure on the Maskat Levy Corps. 5. With regard to the actual details of the scheme, I would invite a re ference to the paragraph “ Enlistment” under II Organization and Constitution. 1 have some doubts as to the suitability of Brahuis of Makran and the Jhallawan country, Kalat State subjects. They are hillmen and, for the first year at any rate of the existence of the Corps, would be serving in the torrid heat of the Mattra valley.

In compliance with the instructions contained in paragraph 3 of your above quoted letter I have now the honour to submit a detailed “ Scheme with Estimates for Raising and Maintaining a Levy Corps for Maskat It will be observed that the Scheme involves an Annual and Recurring Expenditure of Rs. 1,40,518-0-0 and an Initial Expenditure of Rs. 55,042-0-0 or a total expenditure during the first year of Rs. 1 5,560-0-0. 3. Before proceeding to deal with the details of the Scheme and Estimate I would beg to preface this report with the following remarks.— The question of raising a local force for the protection of Maskat and Mattrah and to act as a garrison in relief of the British troops now quartered there has been under the consideration of the Government of India since October last year; and though the subject was, I understand, informally suggested to the Sultan at the time, His Highness does not seem to have seriously realised the necessity for such a force until March of the present year, when the recur rence of unrest in the interior and the increased activity of the rebels caused him to give the matter his more serious attention. Until then His Highness appears to have counted on the continued retention of a garrison of British troops at Bait-al-Falaj and to have even entertained the hope that our troops would be permitted to undertake offensive operations against the enemy in the interior. It was only on learning that the indefinite retention of our trooos and their employment in the interior were out of the question that His Highness really realised that his only hope of ever re-establishing his authority in the interior lay in the establishment of a disciplined local Corps of his own. Since then, as the telegrams I have sent you from time to time will have shewn, His Highness has in conversation always assured me of his earnest desire to see the Levy Corps Scheme carried out, and he has invariably laid stress on the point that it should be under the supervision of British officers, at any rate during its infancy. On the 3rd June last, without troubling His Highness with unnecessary details I briefly outlined the main points of a skeleton scheme, which I had prepared, mainly with a view to ascertaining His Highness’ views as to the com position and strength of the Corps and of the amount of pay to be given to different ranks. At the same time I took the opportunity of explaining to His Highness the main objects of the Corps, being guided in my remarks by the principles laid down in the Government of India’s letter No. 1292 of 12th March 19:4. I explained that all matters of pay, arms and equipment connected with the Corps would naturally be dealt with by the Officer Commanding the Corps # and that iwith regard to the movements and disposition of the troops it would be important for His Highness to consult the wishes of Government. In this way a general idea of the nominal nature of his control of the Corps was conveyed to His Highness, who, however, offered no comment on it. As regards the cost of the Corps His Highness at first demurred somewhat at the rate of pay suggested, especially that proposed for the sepoy, but he finally agreed to the proposals under this head. The Scheme as a whole at first seemed to strike His Highness as being rather more elaborate than he had anticipated and he seemed apprehensive that the cost would probably be beyond his means. His Highness, however, gave the Scheme his provisional approval and at the same time he repeated the request which he had already made to me on more than one occasion, that the new Corps should—to use his own expression—“ re semble the British troops at Bait-al-Falaj as much as possible ”, in order that ” the enemy might still continue to regarc the force at Bait-al-Falaj as troops of the British Government ”, the moral effect of whose presence there, which His Highness regarded as a most powerful weapon in his hands, would, he feared, be lost by the substitution of what might appear to be a less regular and disciplined force. I r *-'4 Should the present Scheme appear at first sight to be a somewhat elaborate and costly one, the only explanation l can offer is that I have endeavoured to carry out His Highness’ wishes in the above respect. My aim has been to evolve a local force, less e'aborate and costly—though in no way less efficient than our regular Indian troops or our Indian Frontier Militias, but more highly organised and equipped than the irregular Tribal Levies of Baluchistan. His Highness being in accord with me on the general lines of the Scheme as far as the composition of the Corps was concerned and his verbal consent there to having been secured, it was arranged that I should proceed to work out the Scheme in more detail and submit a complete Estimate of its cost for His High ness* further consideration. The attached Estimate is the result. As His High ness has been away from Maskat for the past 3 weeks and is still absent I have had no opportunity of discussing it with him in its more complete form. Nor, indeed, do l think it would be expedient to do so until you yourself have had an opportunity of criticising it and submitting it to the Government of India for any modifications that may be considered necessary. 4. I will now deal with the main points of the Scheme that appear to me to call for remark : — (t) British Officers .—That the supervision of the Corps should be in the hands of a British Officer is I think essential and it is hoped that this proposal will meet with approval. A Native Officer in Command might find it difficult to withstand any pressure that His Highness might at times attempt to exercise over him. Moreover, the ultimate efficiency and moral tone of the Corps must, I think, depend entirely on the early training it will receive in its infancy, and such train ing can only be carried out to the best advantage under the supervision of a British rather than a Native Officer. (*7) Strength of Corps .— The strength proposed (300 Fighting men) is that suggested in Sir Percy Cox’s telegram, No. 15-M. of 14th October 1913, to the Government of India, and—as reported in my telegram No. 121 of 15th May 1914 to your address—agreed to by His Highness the Sultan. The number is less by 75 men than the strength of the Briiish garrison now considered necessary for the protection of Maskat and Mattrah. I venture to think that it represents the minimum strength necessary to effi ciently carry out the duties that the Corps will be called upon to perform — more especially if, as seems likely, it will be required to garrison certain outposts in the interior as well as to find a permanent garrison at Head Quarters. {iii) Rates of Pay of British Officers, Indian Rank and File. The pay pro posed for the British Officers has been calculated on the assumption that officers of the rank of Captain and Lieutenant in the Indian Army will be selected for the posts of Commandant and Adjutant, respectively. To their pay as such a suitable addition has been made in view of the special nature of the service they will be called on to perform and the extra cost of living in Maskat. Their pay is no doubt a heavy item, amounting, as it does, to Rs. 19,200, on account of pay and Rs. 16,200 on account of the Contribution for Pension which His Highness will have to pay, making a total of Rs. annually under this head alone. As regards the pay of the Native Ranks this has been fixed, as explained in the body of the Scheme, after taking into consideration the unfavourable climatic and other conditions under which the corps will have to serve. The rates of pay enjoyed by regular troops serving in Oman and the Gulf and by the Levy Corps serving in Mekran have also been taken as a guide, while the amount paid by His Highness to the Baluchis recently enlisted for service in his Palace and City Guards has also been taken into consideration. The rates now proposed for the new Corps comprise “ Pay ”, ' Maskat Allowance ” and ” Compensation for Dearness of Rations.” They total consider ably less than the pay and allowances enjoyed by the Regular Troops serving in / \j* J V Oman and the Gulf, and—except in a few instances—they are about equal to the rates obtaining in the Mekran Levy Corps. The “ Compensation for Dearness of Rations” now proposed is about half of that enjoyed by the Regular Troops of the Maskat Consulate Guard. No provision has been made in these Estimates for “ Good Service Pay ” in the case of Non Commissioned Officers, or for “ Good Conduct Pay” in the case of Sepoys This privelege is enjoyed by the Regular Army and by the Zhob and Mekran Levy Corps. The question of granting it to the Maskat Levy Corps will no doubt be raised in due course. If eventually it is granted it would involve an additional annual expenditure of ranging approximately from a minimum cost of Rs. 144 after 2 years’ service to a maximum of Rs. 576 after 4 years in the case of Non-Commissioned Officers on account of Good Service Pay, and in the case of the Sepoy a minimum annual cost ranging from Rs. 3 264 after 3 years to a maximum of Rs 9,792 after io years on account of Good Conduct Pay. The remaining items under Annual and Recurring Expenditure are fully explained in the body of the Scheme and call for no further remark here. Under “Initial Expenditure' no provision has been made for ‘ Buildings ' because in the absence of expert and professional assistance it was found impos sible to make any estimate that would be reliable. There is no doubt, however, that the cost of erecting permanent Barracks would be very heavy and it would be advisable to defer embarking on any expenditure on this account until expe rience has shewn what the actual requirements of the new Cf rps will be and the type of building that would be most suitable. Some sort of temporary shelter will, however, be necessary for the men during the extreme heat of the summer and a sum of Rs 2,000 for mat huts, similar to those erected for the Regular Troops at Bait-ab Falaj, has been provided. Another item for which no provision has been made is a Machine Gun, which would undoubtedly be a useful—if not essential—addition to the Corps and one that would certainly find favour with His Highness. As already confidential!v reported His Highness has already purchased 2 Quick-firing Machine Guns which I understand are of a portable type and it is possible that His Highness may be willing to place one of these at the disposal of the Corps and thus save any further expenditure on this account. Should this suggestion, however, not meet with approval an estimate of cost in this connection will be submitted. 5. As regards the question of how the cost of the Corps is to be met I would mention that His Highness has never definitely stated his inability to meet the entire cost himself, but he has on more than one occasion hinted that it would be beyond his means to meet any very large expenditure on this account. Some idea of the extent to which His Highness seemed prepared to go in this respect may be gathered from a remark he made to me that in his opinion the Zanzibar subsidy would be “ more than sufficient to cover the cost of the Corps ”. As will be seen from these Estimates the Zanzibar subsidy would cover only a little over half the proposed cost of the new Corps. Half the annual cost of the Corps comes to Rs. The Zanzibar subsidy amounts to Rs 86,400. His Highness has never raised the question of the participation by Govern ment in the expenses of the Corps, nor have I ever led His Highness to think that Government would be prepared to contribute towards its establishment and maintenance. But this question, I think, is bound to come up now, if and when the present Estimate is presented to him. I would, therefore, ask that the decision of the Government of India in this matter may be obtained and communicated to me. In this connection it was suggested in Sir Percy Cox’s telegram, No. 15-M. of 14th October 1913 to the Government of India that the ” cost would have to be a charge on Customs Revenue or on subsidies paid ”, Again in your telegram (as Political Agent, Maskat), No. 215, dated nth December 1913, to the Resident in Bushire, it was proposed that “ half the cost CSOFD 4 H| j ishould be paid from and limited to the present subsidy of Rs. 7,200 per mensem which Maskat draws as Zanzibar subsidy. The other half should be paid by the British Government as an additional subsidy”. I venture to express my opinion in favour of the latter proposal. But as the Zanzibar subsidy (Rs. 86,400 annually) covers mere than half the annual cost of the corps (Rs. 70,259) I would suggest that the whole of that subsidy be contributed by His Highness, and that the balance only (Rs. 54,118) be met by Government. The whole amount (Rs. 1,40,518), should, I suggest, be placed under the control of the Political Agent, Maskat, who would sanction its disbursement in accordance with an annual Budget which the Officer Commanding the Corps would submit and which would presumably have to receive His Highness’ informal approval. As regards the Initial Expenditure required the first year (Rs. 35,042), this would doubtless have to take the form of a loan to the Sultan to be repaid by him in instalments either from His Highness’ other subsidy of Rs. 8,333-5-4 per mensem or from his Customs Revenues. In the latter case, I venture to think, the Government of India—in order to ensure regular payments which might otherwise be uncertain—would possibly deem it expedient to suggest to His Highness the advisability of obtaining on loan the services of British officials for the more profitable management of his Customs Department.i mm wm Scheme with Estimates for raising and maintaining a Levy Corps for Maskat.I. —Introduction.

In the accompanying scheme, proposals are submitted for raising and maintaining an Infantry Levy Corps, 300 strong, for service in Oman. 2. The Primary objects of the proposed Corps are— * {a) “ to enable the withdrawal of the Indian troops at present garrison ing the towns of Maskat and Mattrah”, {b) “ to place at the nominal disposal of the Sultan a locally raised force sufficient to assert his authority and defend his capital against rebellious tribesmen ”, and to “ to furnish a reserve from which detachments may be drawn to garrison such of His Highness’ inland Forts as he may hereatter recover In preparing the present scheme the above objects have been borne in mind. 3.

The temporary headquarters of the Corps to be at either Bait-al-Falaj, where the present garrison of regular troops is now quarter ed, or at Ruwi, miles to the south of BaiCal-balaj, where a suitable camp could be established. Of the two places, Bait-aCFalaj, as being nearer Mattrah, where supplies are obtainable, would probably be more convenient.

A.—(a) The following rates of monthly pay are proposed for the combatant ranks and followers of the Corps— (i) British officers. i.

It is assumed that a Military Officer (preferably a fairly senior Captain of the Indian Army) will be selected for the post of Com mandant of the Corps and not (as in the case of the Mekran Levy Corps) a junior officer of the Political Department who would be ex-officio Commandant of the Corps. Considering the extra cost of living in Maskat and the disagreeable *Pay of a Captain, I.

This officer should be a Lieutanant in the Indian Army and the amount of pay proposed would—as in the case of the Commandant—include travelling allow ance except passages by rail and steamer. As he would combine the duties of Adjutant and Quartermaster, the rate of pay proposed is appropriate.4 ) (li) Indian Rank and file— In fixing the rate of pay of the Indian officers, Non-Commissioned officers and rank and file, (more, especially that of the sepoy) the following points have been taken into consideration :— (a) The disagreeable nature of the climate and service in Oman. {b) The high price of food stuffs and extra cost of living generally. (c) The pay offered by His Highness to the Baluchis recently enlisted for His Highness’ palace and city guards. In calculating the pay of the native ranks of the new Corps, therefore, the pay of the different ranks in the regular Army has been taken as a basis and to this has been added certain “ allowances 5 '' on account of “ Maskat allowance” and “ Compensation for dearness of rations.” The rates of pay prevailing in the Mekran Levy Corps have also been taken as a guide. To take the 3 above mentioned points separately : — (a) Regular troops serving in the Gulf receive either free rations or “Compensation in lieu of free Foreign Service rations ”. The garrison at Bait-al-Falaj receive the former, while the detachment which forms the Consulate Guard at Maskat enjoys the latter. In this connection the Officer Commanding Troops has remarked that the latter “ is not a satisfactory ration for men doing hard work ”. It has been considered that in the case of the new Corps it would be more convenient to give “ Compensation for dearness of rations'. The average amount paid per month to each sepoy of the Consulate Guard at Maskat as “ Compensation in lieu of rations ” over a period of 12 months works out to Rs. 14-1-10; that is, to say, Rs. 14 represents the average amount that it costs a sepoy to feed himself in Maskat. But the “ ration ” of a sepoy in the regular army contains articles of diet which might, in the case of an irregular Corps of men with less elaborate tastes, be regarded as “ luxuries” and these have, therefore, been eliminated. It is considered that an allowance of Rs. 7 8-0 per man per month would be a fair allowance on account of “ Compensation for dear ness of rations ” for the native ranks of the new Corps and this amount has, therefore, been included in these estimates. (£) Indian troops of the regular army serving in Oman receive “ Batta ” on this account amounting to sums varying from Rs. 15 in the case of the Subedar-Major to Rs. i*8-o in the case of a sepoy. The amounts now proposed as “ Batta” or “ Maskat allowance ” for the new Corps are (except in the case of the sepoy) somewhat less than the “ Batta” enjoyed by the regular troops. (c) The amount fixed by His Highness as the pay of his newly enlist ed “ palace guards ” (Baluchis from Mekran and Basra) was Rs 15 per mensem without food. But of the 31 men enlisted to date 16 have deserted, having refused to serve on the amount of pay offered. His Highness pays his gunners from Shiraz Rs. 25 and free rations. In the opinion of Mir Rustom Khan Gitchki of Kej, the Baluch Jemadar of Fort Jelali, who was consulted, the minimum rate of pay with which a Baluch sepoy would be con tented, would be Rs. 20 per mensem without food or Rs. 10 with free rations. His Highness whom I also consulted on the subject has agreed that Rs. 20 per mensem would be an adequate rate of pay for the sepoy of the new Levy Corps. This amount, Rs. 20, has, therefore, been shown in these estimates as the sepoy’s rate of pay. Column V of the following table shows the total monthly pay proposed for the different ranks of the Corps, from Subedar- Major to Sepoy. The last Column VI shows the total pay enjoyed by the same ranks of the Indian Army serving in Maskat or the Persian Gulf. It must be noted that regular troops also6 (vi) Hospital Establishment. Rs.

(For details, vide serial items 1 to 27 of Appendix A.) A. (J). (i) Clothing Allowance .—It will be necessary to give each sepoy an initial grant for clothing [vide B (*) below] and also an annual clothing allowance for the upkeep of his kit. In the Indian Army a sepoy receives Rs. 60 on this account on joining and Rs. 14 annually as clothing allowance. But it will be unnecessary for the new Corps to keep up such an elaborate kit as that maintained in the regular army and such items as “ Serge Full Dress ”, etc., have, therefore, been eliminated from these estimates. The items given below with their approximate prices represent the mini mum amount of kit which a sepoy of the new Corps should be in possession of :-~ Rs. A.

This works out to Rs. 298 x 8 = Rs. 2,384 annually. (V,de serial item No. 28 of Appendix A). . (') Firewood Allowance .—Nearly all fuel in Maskat is imported. The price of it, therefore, for cooking purposes is almost prohibitive. Regular troops7 serving in Maskat receive a Government allowance for this purpose. It is estimated that in the case of the Levy Corps an allowance of Rs. 2 per man per month throughout the Corps would be suffi cient. *316 x 2 X 12 = Rs. 7 - 5 ^ 4 j an ' * 298 fighting men, 18 followers. nually. {Vide serial item 29). (iii) Transport .—It is difficult to estimate the amount that will be required annually under this head. The Sultan might, no doubt, be approached with a view to his always supplying transport free for the Corps, but the transport furnished would be impressed camels or donkeys. Forced labour or “ oegar ” is always unsatisfactory and, therefore, an annual allotment should be made to enable the Commandant to be independent of it. For the purpose of these estimates it has been assumed that the Corps would require transport during 2 months of the year, and that—if frds of the Corps moved, 60 donkeys (a low estimate) would be required. The rate of hire for donkeys locally is $ 1 or Rs. 1-8-0 per day per donkey and is cheaper than that for camels which would have to be obtained from the interior. 60 donkeys for 60 days at Rs. i-8 per day works out to 60X iix6o=Rs. 5,400 {Vide serial item 30, Appendix A). (iv) Miscellaneous Annual and Recurring expenses ) Fares of Furlough men —It is suggested that the Native Officers and men of the Corps be given a sum equal to a return passage from Maskat to Gwadur when proceeding on furlough. For the purpose of these estimates it is assumed that— 1 Native officer (2nd class) and 44 men (3rd class) will proceed on furlough annually. Rs. 1 2nd class Return ticket to Gwadur costs 1 3 r d &gt;&gt; n &gt;1 u ••• 10 This works out to Rs. 39 plus Rs. 10 x 44 •= Rs 479, say, Rs. 480. {Vide serial item 31, Appendix A.) (v) Contribution to Pension payable by His Highness for 2 British officers on Foreign service. Assuming that the officer selected for the post of Com mandant will not have more than 14 years’service and the Adjutant not more than 5 years’ service, and that, for the purposes of these estimates, the two officers will not have less than 14 and 5 years’ service, respectively, the following amounts under Article 767 (i) and (ii), Civil Service Regulations, would have to be paid by His Highness :— Rs. 1 British officer of 14 years’ service ... 950 per mensem. » Total Rs. 1,350 per mensem or annually Rs. 16,100. {Vide serial item 32, Appendix A.) (vi) Musketry .—Assuming that each man of the Corps fires 96 rounds annually at practice and that the price of ammunition (including freight to Mas kat) is 1 anna per round, the amount required under this head comes to— Rs. 298 x 6 = Rs. 1,788. {Vide serial item 33, Appendix A.) (vii) Hospital.—\i is proposed that a stationary hospital be maintained at the head quarters of the Corps. In serious cases patients would be transferred to the Maskat and Mattrah Charitable Hospital for treatment. In this case as His Highness makes no subscription to this Hospital, a small annual subscription8 J should be provided by the Corps for its maintenance. For, this purpose, Rs. 100 per annum is suggested. In addition, an annual allowance for medicines, dres sings, etc., will be necessary—say, Rs. 200. Total Rs. 300. {Vide serial item 34, Appendix A.) (viii) Good Conduct Pay and Good Service Pay.—No provision has been made under this head ; but the question will no doubt be raised in course of time. Men of the regular Indian Army and Mekran Levy Corps received Good Conduct Pay and Good Service Pay. (Vide Army Regulations, India, Volume I, paragraphs 983 and 988.)

But as Rs. 8 per man has already been provided under annual clothing allowance, which will not be payable until the 2nd year, the amount of the initial grant must be reduced by that sum. We get, therefore, for 298 men— Rs. 298x28(36*8) = Rs. 8,344.

The cost of provid ing such shelters for the regular troops at Bait*al*Falaj (375 men) was Rs. 2,500. A sum of Rs. 2,000, has been provided for the new Corps under the head “ Hutting”.

V&lt;’e hare considered the scheme fully and find that the following difficulties confront us;- (1) . The proposed strength of 300 is considered insufficient for replacing the regular troops (*y the military authorities who recommend 500. The cost of this,however, would po'bably fce prohibitive. (2) , During the jkeriod of the war it would lie difficult, if not impossible, to spare British Officers, and it is not at all likely that any would volunteer for this service. The employment of Police Officers has been suggested, but it would probably be quite as difficult to spare them, and it seems undesirable to start the scheme with Police Officer if they are eventually to be replaced by military officers, (3) The attitude of H.H. the Sulten appears only lukewarm. Js /uC Ko 4-s prepared to definitely surrender the Zanzibar sub- -sidy, and in view of his constant applications for loans can he really afford to do so? xhe Govt of India would be glad of your views generally on the subject, and v/hether you deem it desirable to push through US utU the scheme/ in view of the developments which have taken place since the scheme was submitted. The only alternative to raising the levy Corps appears to be to grant the Sultan a subsidy for raising a force himself, probably you have already considered this alternative and diecarded it as hopeless. A£&amp;RjefPfe*d to S* Addressed to Sir P.Cox; repeated to Masqat&amp;»«cat hery Corps, J40TJS by the PelltioaX A^ent x aecHt with reference te foreign Department Telegram,He*398 3.dated 8th.April 1913. 0 —— 1 . The question ef the establishment of a Levy Cerps for Hascat is at present confronted with difficulties which did not exist when eifce Scheme was originally submitted. On the one hand it is now most desirable that the British &amp;arr» -ison,at present held up for the protection of ^ascat,should be released as speedily as possible ; on the other,owing to recent conditions developments,are generally unfavourable to the early introduct ion of the Scheme which would have enabled us to substitute an efficient body of irregular troops to replace the present garr ison. 8o long,therefore,as an efficient substitute cannot fee found,the retention of the present British garrison must,it seems,continue• At the sjuae time there would seem to be no reason why, if the difficulties with regard to expenses and the provision ©f Brit ish officers can be overcome (vide para 2 ), the Scheme should not be launched forthwith. 2. The points raised by the Government of India are as follows and I will deal with the® in order :- (1) Strength of Cor-&gt;3 .' The military authorities consider the pi proposed strength of 300 insufficient for replacing regular ' troops. They recommend 500; but the cost of 500 would probably be prohibitive '. ^. (apart from the question of cost) The decisioi^ as to what strength will toe sufficient to replace the regylar troops must,I think,depend on two main considerat ions via. (a) xk&amp;kxx whehher we are to legislate for normal local condit- ( ions such as existed before the sutomission of the Levy Corps Scheme ; or for abnormal conditions such as have characterized f the local situation during the past few months. In the former case idi*xif«x*±*xx*fxx*js±, 300 men would be suff icient,while in the latter even 500 irregular troops would.13 i at we ferh*»i&gt;8 reas«nalily anticipate their/ ultimate success sr, in any case,a permanent aaslisratisn sf existing csniiiti»ns, thus eliminating from the situation the grounds upsn which at/ present an increase t# the originally preposed strength ef the Cerps has been considered necessary. (2$• VroTlsien ef British Offdcere for the Csrps. 4 c It weuld in «y opinioiyMost undesirable te substitute Felice f«r Military Officers te train the new Corps. If Military Officers cannot at present be spared,then I fear the intrduction of the Bcheme must be pedtpened until they are avail able. i suggest however for ae*ta&amp; consideration that if 2 Officen -ers cannot be made available, one at least might be spared to act act as Adjutant and that the services of a Military Officer of the Political Departmnet be lent who would be an Assistant to the Pol itical Agent i^ascat and ex officio Comwandant of the Corps. / tn /L*k In this connection I would invite a reference to the latte^/of Celonel Knox’s telegram He.32C ef 7th.February 1916 en the subject of the necessity of providing an Assistant for the Political Ag ent ^ascat in connecti/h/ with the negotiations mentioned in the preceding paragraph. (3) Attitude of the Buitan and whether he is definitely prepared to surrender the Zanzibar subsidy. I do net thin* that His Highness* attitude can be described as ’lukewarm*. . His Highness has always shewn a keen desire te nee Corps the Hevy/aoheme introduced, and a fdrther conversation I have just had with him on the subject confirms this view. At the same tirse His Highness has always expressed some anxiety regarding the cost of the new Serps and has/ invariably asked that its strength and cost may be kept as low as possible,compatible with the duties that the corps will be called upon to perform. The Scheme with its estimates has never yet been shewn in detail to His Highness; but he has definitely informed me that fcfcs though his other expen ses are extremely heavy and the surrender of the whole of the §an- zioar subsidy would/inconvenient, yet he would be prepared to d«- vote it te the payment ef the Corps. His Highness is from all accounts still much in debt* The chequewhich we to hia monthly «n s.ccount of his two subsidies is at once hamied over to &amp; wealthy Arah ia Mascat( Sayad Yusuf £awawi) who,it is generally Jcnown, receives it in liquidation of of the debt which His Highness owes hia. The surrender,therefore,of one of the subsidies to Government ivould net only farther increase Hie Highness 1 financial emlearr- asments but it would also probably lead to more frequent applic ations for leans to tide over pressing difficulties. It cannot therefore truly be said that His Highness can afford to devote the subsidy to the expenses of the new Corps. On the other hand,v/ith the establishment of the new corps, the plea on which loans have hitherto been applied for by His higft- nness -viz.ior the payment of rifles,ammunition and friendly tri’oesmen employed in connection with the suppression of local unrest, would no longer hold good and we might therefore anti cipate their discontinuance on that score. (4) Desirability or otherwise of pushing through the Scheme ferthwith. This question has been dealt with in para.l. To postpone the introduction of the Scheme will invelve the centinued retentien cf regular treops in Mascat, which it is eur ebject te try and uveid, (&amp;) Grant of a subsidy te the Sultan te raise a ferce mS. his MXJftx for himself. I venture te submit that such &amp; course would be so much waste cj money. i very much doubt if Hid Highness could enlist a single raun except by lorce 9 A conscript corps would be doomed to failure from the start,while it would also be a most unreliable body of men. During the past few months His Highness has been endeavouring to raise a 'Palace Guard' for himself. With the greatest difficulty he has succeeded in forcibly enlisting about bO recruits. Desertions are common and His Highness i*&amp;s made himself far from popular by this forcible ky Jfchi* enlist ment. The men are wotthless fot anything but ceremonial pur poses. |f. 3. Another alternative to the proposed increase in theetr«n£th of the cerpc an^ ©ne which »ight cwiamend iteelf to OoTern TRent a8 llein « PT-cbalily less endive than the addition** of 200 men su^eats itself.

Some have enlisted in answer to our * Proclamation of 1332. Others are now called upon to do so. This is expedient in view of present conditions, as is advised in the Holy w,uran and the sayings of the Holy Prophet. 2. Those who enlist voluntarily and those who are seized and enlisted by royal orders, are alike treated with justice and * consideration in respect of their individual rights, privileges etc, 3. The 3ai f di Government grants to those who are in military employe, the following benefits (1) If single or unmarried and witiout family, the usual pay with food and clothes including 2 uniforms, 2 pairs of shoes, 2 shirts, 2 trousers and 1 cap every year together with equipments. (2) If married, or has a dependent parent or sister unable to earn livelihood, each such dependent is f ;iven 3 maunds of rice per mensem in addition to his own pay etc. (3) If a man dies after enrolment, his wife, parents and others, if dependent on him, are to be given jg.3/- per mensem for life. (4) After enlistment a soldier has a right to make repre- -sentations to His Highness on anything concerning him. He will do so respectfully and shall not say anything against Law. (5) If a soldier goes on leave, he will be granted half the journey- expenses when going out of Kaskat. (6) If be is transferred in service, he will be conveyed free of charge and will be given, in addition, 50 pice per day, if a private 95 -do- mawin Shawish 125 i £1&lt; O 1 Shawish 160 -do- Vaxil Zabit. (7) A. soldier will be granted especial rights and privilege different from other servants of the State, as long as he does not offend against Law. m he does he will be severely punished. (8) If a soldier deserts, he will be imprisoned for 1 year first time; for 2 years, a second tine, and if he deserts a third time he will be sentenced to death (former orders cancelled.) (9) This applies to all who are already in Military employ, (1$) The date when this comes in force is the 25th Zil-Haj* 1334 (24-10-16).

The Sultans expressed object was to have a Corps which would in its officers and its appearance lead the tribes to think that he still had British troops to assist him. It is however evident that with his present system of adainistratiom he cannot afford this luxury but in mvy case as it is not possible to remove our troops from Beit-el-FalaJ the matter is one of future rather than immediate importance. I When however we do desire to remove our troops something will be -equiied to take their plaoe and this oannot be evolved *t a moments notice. During the last two years I nave been employed on the ttoaff of a Division at home and nave assisted in the training of troops from the raw material. I oan tnen speak from knowledge of the necessity of having a nucleus from which to form the force whloh will be required whatever may be its final form and purpose. In his letter Bb.154 dated the 23nd July 1916 Lieut Colonel Benn informed you of the formation by His Highness of a bodyguard of troops under one Mohammed Fuad.

The condi tions of luscat ;ire peculiar. The essentia s of a levy corps in an Arab State are (1) That It should not be Arab (3) That It should be very highly paid (3) That It should be small and mobile £4) That the State should be able to afford it. {) needs no explanation to anyone who has had even elementary experience of the Arab or who has studied the recent history of the HeJaz,to say nothin*- of Oman whose tribes are the most notoriously treacherous In Arabia. (3) is peculiarly applicable to 'hascat where conditions of life are the reverse of pleasant. (3) is essential as the levy must be in a position to inflict sullen punishment in a short space of time. In )ther words what Is wanted Is a small .i^hly paid aai well-trained and loyal body of cut-throat mercenaries with no ties in the c&gt;untry in which taey servo,and no love f&gt;r the Arab. It is no use blinking th's fact. For these reasons I submit tne following proposals. (1) A Baluch levy to be formed as a permanent force for the Muscat state.

The effect on $he interior is bound to be good, as the more they see that the Buitan is strong, the more peacefully wfcll they behave- No qualms need be entertain ed on the subject of employing Baluchis. The Oman which if t.-e only portion of Oman over which we hope to make the authority of the Buitan felt is entirely cosmopolitan and almost as . The tribes fear Balucois, not Arabs much Baluch as Arab whom tuey always expect to be treacherous# In the dim future if the resources of the state should permit, it would be possible to increase this levy to six hundred men. In these circumstances detachments would be stationed at Bur and Sohar, in addition to the main body at Mattrah. The running expenses of the levy can be met from the monthly income of the state, and tne necessary capital expenditure from tne sale of tiie Sultan’s yacht. Should Government however make a present of the equipment it will be possible to buy a good motor boat which is urgently n eded # I greatly hope that it will be possible to put these proposals en train at very early date. r . o deal with conditions of Muscat and Oman a highly trained body of men perfectly equip, ed with every modem system of supply is not wanted- A snail body of semi foreigners, well armed and net too well disciplined will meet the case far better.

The Political Agent when reporting on the financial con dition of the Sultanate in his letter no*233f : dated 2f/n/1919 anticipated the need for a levy corps, and the scheme which i he now proposes comes very near the one outlined by sir Percy I cox in the above-mentioned telegram. Mr. Vfingate’s scheme is less ambitioua and less costly than the scheme put forward by Lieut-Col, Bonn in his letter no.145 dated 29th June 1914, and conforms, I think, to the conditions laid down in Foreign andand Political Department letter no*1292-D dated 12th ?TarcIi 1913: There is no doubt that tho sultan will readily consent to the employment of such a force as Mr, Wingate proposes, and now that a British Officer has been appointed Wazir to the sultan, the force should not be employed in any specially hazardous adventures. In any case the corps vzould bo entirely a !‘uscat force, and we should not I consider be called upon to inter vene in support of it, unless there was a serious danger of a successful attach against Puttra and Muscat, in which event uality, Judging from the past, we should have to intervene in any case, 4, ab regards the actual scheme proposed by the Political Agent, I an in general accord with his suggestion* I agree with him that the local Arabs are absolutely unsuitod for onlirfnent and that the corps should be connosod of Baluchis, There are large numbers of Baluchis settled all along the Coast of Oman, and the Sultans in the past have nearly always © ployed Baluchis as their personal troops and for garrl;-5ons of the old Portuguese forts, Baluchis, in fact, are largely employed by Arabs and other rulers in the uulf, as they have the reputation of being faithful to their employers - e,g, the Shaikh of Mohammerah employs a considerable number as guards and night watchmen? tho Turks used to employ a pood many at Basrah as police, night watchmen etc and the mercantile community used also to engage Baluchis as night watchmen; a good many too are employed at Bahrain, In the circmstances I think there would be no objection to the employment of Baluchis in Oman on the point of nationality, even in those days, lloarly all the Baluchis in Oman come from Persian and British Melrran, and I think the force should chiefly be com posed of Hekrania, 5, I would suggest then, that if the ooVermont of India approve of the scheme and seo no objection, the Hor^ble the Agent to the Governor General in Baluchistan might be asked* of the Mekran Levy Corps to permit son© sonior non-conmissioned officers/and any number of almost time expired men 'ssrhich can conveniently be spared to volunteer for enploynent with the Muscat Levy Corps# Or perhaps if no men could be spared the Commandant might be authorized to use his influence to get men who have recently left the Corps to re-engage for service in Muscat# I presume that the Me'ran Jfevy Corps being a small body wotild not have a suitable Ealuch officer who could be spared and vjho would volunteer for the post of Commandant of the Muscat Lovy* If this is correct I venture to suggest that some subadar or Subadar Major from one of the Baluch Battalions who is eligible for pension and still active and energetic might volunteer for the appointment, if applications are called for# Similarly as tho Political Agent suggests two mountain guns with the force or volunteer from among the senior non commissioned officers or jemadars of the Mountain Artillery eligible for pension, might bo obtained. 6. I agree with Ur. Mingate in t.:ih ing that the co%s olov.Xd eventually be under the command of a Baluoh or Indian officer, but I am inclined to think that it would be advisable to employ a British officer, preferably an ox Adjutant of the Hehran Levy Corps if one is available, for a few months just to get the corps started and put on a sound footing, perhaps if they agree the Government of India would be pleased to the services of a British officer for 6 months or a year to do this. 7. as regards the arms and equipment of the oopps, as tho formation of the corps will, it is hoped, result in a consider able saving to Government by the withdrawal of Indian troops from Muscat, and as no doubt considerable surplus stores of equipment exist, I venture to support Mr. Wingate r s suggestion that the Government of India should make a present of the arms and equipment to the Corps. I would also suggest that the service of a £; ritish officer as instructor should bo givento the Sultan froo of charges all other ©xponGOs In connection with the corns should bo not from ’ruscat rovenues. 8, If the (^ovornnent ol la concurs with these proposals I trust that early orders nay bo issued so that natters may be put in train with a view to getting the Levy Corps started and training begun as soon as possible# to permit of the with drawal of the Indian troop© next cold weather, if possible # A copy of this lettor is being sent to the Acting Civil Comraifesioner Baghdad, who, when telegraphing to me to submit the Muscat scheme to the uoVermont of India, concurred general ly wit' the views expressed.

I agree with Political Agent Muscat that local Arabs absolutely unsuited for enlistment, that corps should be Baluchi and that very hightly trained force not necessary but I think in the first instance British officer with experience of levies preferably ex Adjutant of Mekran Levy Corps should be lent to H.H. Sultan f s Government for certain period say 6 months or one year to organize corps and give it a start. As you know there is nothing new in employment of Baluchis in Oman or elsewhere in Gulf: Sultans have had Baluch Askars and tupchis as garrisons for their forts for years and Turks and Shaikh of Mohammerah always employed considerbaijle numbers as night nolice chowkidars etc at Basrah and Mohammerah respectively. Baluchis in Oman are nearly all Mekranis and Kejis and I think that if they can be spared certain number of N.C.Os and men from Mekran Levy Corps might if they volunteer be transferred to form nucleus of :uscat Levy Corps, or failing these perhaps ex Levy CornsCorps sepoys who are not too old mi'''“t be enlisted tnrough good offices of Commandant of the Corps. Perhaps Subadar or Subadar- Major of one of Baluoh Battalions who is eligible for pension could be engaged as Commandant. Great c re would have to be tahen to secure thoroughly reliable man as eventually he would be one of most powerful men in State. There would have to be a Jemadar in charge of the guns and it would be necessary to get suitable man. possibly one about to take pension, from Mountain Battery. As the formation of corps would result in reduction of wing of regiment now in Oman and as no doubt plenty of surplus stock , available I think Government might well make present of the guns and arms and ammunition and equipment. I do not see necessity for as many as 50 revolvers and 10,000 rounds of ammunition rest of equipment suggested seems necessary. Deputy Political Resident. Telegram.Code. Civil Commissioner, ^aghdad.

I have t;he following remark? to offer regarding the possibilities of recruiting men for the above Corps either entirely or partly from the Sistan Levy Corps. 1. The following statement which shows a comparison between the rates of pay drawn by a Sistan Camelry man when serving in and out of the Sistan Oasis and the rates of pay which it is proposed to pay to the Muskat Levy will not it will be observed be sufficiently attentive to induce the Sistani A Balooch to go so far afield so long as he can entertain hopes of remaining on in the 0 istan Levy Corps:- ^ay Sistan Levy Co v«r*, q * l«L C* . Pay Muskat Levy. In Ex Oasis *Qas is Kisaldar ^a,1or Krs . eoo *t7o * Comdt. P s.300 © 275 © 350 -Krs Rlsaldar. 500 570 Jem.Adjt . 200 -550 Krs. 1 Jemadar. 400 470 Jemadar 150 -412 Krs.!

As regards rqtion* when serving outside the Oasis of ^istan the Listan Levy is given a ration of 2 lbs ’Ata. It is suggested that a similar ration of Ata or part Ata and part rice should be given-in Muskat. The grant of a ration of ^ lb meat and 2 oz ghi would doubtless be an added inducement but it is recognised that it is important to keep the supply arrangements as simple as possible. It strike^ me as most important that the men should be allowed to remit at a fjxed rate of exchange any money not drawn by them in Muskat. It would he necessary to give facilities for making remittances &gt; this could probably toe arranged through the Consular Office In Sistan. itXV * LJ It is suggested that if the rate of exchange were fixed at Krs.350/- to Its. 100 the pay would Pe sufficiently attractive as it stands, if Sepoys were given a rise to the pay suggested for L/Naicks. In Sistan all cajnelry have to provide themselves with a xx camel. All ranks pay Krs. 10 p.m. into tine -hands Fund and after verification of death of animal receive Krs.200 as compensation from this fund. If they have to purchase another camel in the open market they pay not less than Krs.500 for it. Camel casualties are numerous. If therefore as it is presumed the men will not have to provide themselves with their remounts, there will he a distinct pecuniary advantage in service/ with the Muskat Levies. However, the Balooch will probably turn his bling eye towards this advantage when weighing up the situation. 2. So long as the men are actually serving in the Sistan Levy Corps, I am certain there will not be nearly sufficient volunteers for Muskat. If disbandment of three hundred of the Sistan Levy Corps were now ordered I think it would be possible to obtain half the requisite number by the end of August ready for despatch, always provided that it were possible to sanction recommend- . ations contained in para 1. 3. The following minor suggestions not affecting the financial side are made;- q) That remission to send men out as N.0.0*3 be given b) That the efficiency of the Corps would he increased if the following appointments were given to ex Hazara 1 .0*6 and N.(JQ*3 or other ex regular men who have been instructors in the Sistan Levy Corps. JemAdlt, Hav Major, 1 N.C.O. per 100 men. (c) That the first term of service/ be reduced from 5 to 3 years. That one (d) period of 2 months leave during their first agreement would be preferable to 1 months leave per year after the first yearn service. ^ My reasons for suggestions (c) and (d) are that men are likely to be shy of taking on for 5 years and as it is intended to allow them to go on leave, there will really be no hold on them. My experience is that local men are seldom content with a months leave which is too frequently overstayed in spite of severe penalties oinse writing the above I have interviewed Kechi Khan who incidentally consider would suitable for the cost of Commandant and confident that there will be no difficulty in obtaining volunteers provided (a) Provision as suggested is made for families (b) The rates of pay are slightly more favourable than those obtaining in the S.L.C. Risaldar be fcoaxM he is very(c) Rations are pro'/icied. The rrjen would be very nervous about taking on unless it was patent that they would not have to expend possibly a large proportion of their pay on necessaries. (d) The term of service is reduced. He is alive to the advantage of having a certain number of trained instructors with the Corps. I would suggest that if assistance is to be given to Political Officer Muskat at a definite and early date axnd at the same time assured employment is to be found for a considerable number of the Sistan Levy Corps it would be well to have all Levy Cavalry north of Shusp relieved of convoy duties. Troops so relieved could be employed ot Hurrnuk, Lutak Baring and Buniabad on duties at present carried out by Camelry It would then become possible to recruit for the Iluskat Levy Corps forthwith. It would be advisable to grant men one months leave at least before sending them away.. As animals are not required to be taken, I consider men should be despatched via Karachi. A British Officer could accompany them as far as Karachi. To march the men to Bundar Abba$ would entail considerable arrangements for transport at an unfavourable time of the year. j **1 t i/r* Telegram Code.

Subject Muscat levies. Please refer to your telegram of the 8th August No.1475. It is the opinion of the Secretary of State that under existing circumstances the export of the necessary arms and ammunition is not allowed under the arms traffic convention. On the scheme generally and on tMis aspect of the case in praticular he makes the following observations. ' In order to enable the Sultan to import arms it appears first to be necessary tkAthe should announce his willingnesss to adhere to the arms traffic convention. This might enable the Sultan to import from France and the U.S.A, and would fa £ r invite more attention to our proceedings. At the same time the restrictions of Article VII are very necessary, and it is possible that this would not become a serious inconvenience as the existing warehouse rules could easily be made to comply In any case under Article V it would be necessary to report export. The second course wnich is open to obvious objection is that Muscat should be partly a protectorate. The tiiird is that the Sultan should supply his requirements either by taking over the rifles of the British detachment when it leaves Muscat which would be open to criticism as a breach of the spirit of the convention or by withdrawing rifles from the warehouse if they are serviceable. In any case this course would not supply the revolvers or the mountain guns required. I should be glad of your views before approaching the F.O. I have not yet been informed as to the details 6f the new levy scheme. I am doubtful as to the possibility of financing it from Muscat revenues unless it i* much modified from that proposed by Colonel Benn and Colonel Knox in 1914, The cost must have been much increased sin ce then, and the estimates then were Rs. 36,000/- for initial expenditure and 1^ lakhs recurring expenditure f please telegraph your views and suggestions especially as regards the financila aspect of the question. i—a—Telegram R« From Trevor Bush!re To Wingate Muscat No*1856 iatei 17/10/30. Demi-official. The situation as set forth in the Secretary of State’s telegram seems quite Gilbertian. An independent ruler cannot arm hlB forces ? while everybody else who wants rifles smuggles them In. What io you suggest ? Are there anough rifles in the arms warehouse ? or failing ather source perhaps portion of stray rifles from Koweit going to the persiam coast might be diverted to Oman ? Sultan will not get mountain guns of course. Telegram R. From Wingate Muscat To Trevor Bushire. No.2104 dated 18/10/20. Demi-official. See my telegram immediately following dfcafted before receipt of your telegram. Only solution is the adherence of Muscat to the Convention as the existence of an independent state in the prohibited area is otherwise an anomaly. Cannot the bogey of hostile criticism etc be largely discounted now ?Telegram P. From Political MuBcat To Political Bushire ani Foreign Simla No*2105 dayel 17/10/20 Tne financial questions involved in Foreign telegram No.ll39S dated 15/10/20 are answered by my letter No.2054 of the 12th October which has been sent to you and Foreign. There Is a balance this year to the credit of Muscat state of 34; lakhs cCT rupees. By X*$dkxKx 30th September 1921 which is the end of the next financial year it is est mates that there will be a balance of nearly six lakhs. In making this estimate nearly one lakh h&lt;^s been provided for the repayment of the loan, Rs80,000/- for the purchase of motor boats and marine charges, and nearly two lakhs for the levy which includes recurring expenditure for nine months and initial expenditure of Rs. 50,000/-. I estimate that the yearly cost of my scheme will be less than tow lakfts and it is much modified from Colonel Benn’s ani adapted to suit modem conditions. In considering the general question I would call ettehtlon to the great cachange in the present condition of Muscat add Oman, and to my letters of the 14th and 15th October on these subjects. (1) peace has been reestablished with Oman. (2) An effort is being made to create an Arab state self- governing except in so far that in accordance with the terms of our agreements the Advice of the p.A. must be taken on certain points. (3) Muscat state can with a little firection pay for itself and its defence which latter we are providing at great expense with no return, ani the moment will therefore be soon opportune for withdrawing from our absurd position. (4) The state is now ruled by a Council of Minsiters and the the Sultan has no interest in anything except an easy life (5) We are in charge if American interests and the French are withdrawing their consulate. I^'dI ^ As Muscat has an arms aarehouse Article X of the Convention seems to give power to Muscat state as sovereign ani independent to import arms for state purposes subject to certain formalities and to adhesion to the Convention.- ' --- — - .. As tue request has to come from the State itself tiiere is no reason to believe that this will be misuse! in the present circumstances as explained above. There are only useless rifles an! bad ammunition in the warehouse, so the suggestion for supply from this source is impossible.Telegram P. From political Bushire To Foreign Simla anl political Muacat. No.1894 dated 21/10/30. In jrlew of letters which the P.A. Muscat refers to in his telegram I think that there is no doubt that the state exchequer can stand the expense of the modest levy corps proposed by Wingate and that the financial aspect of the establishment of the levy corps is therefore disposed of. It appears to me that with regard to the other'aspects of th e question raised in the Secretary of State's telegram, except in the unlikely event of France and America admitting that Great Britain has a protectorate or mandate over Muscat, the Sultan of Muscat must signify his adherence to the Convention, as it is an anomaly that an Independent state should exist within the prohibited area otherwise. It would be possible to defer the question of the mountain guns till the return of the Sultan. I understand that M.Vadala recently French viceconsul here xmxxJEfc who is now the new French consul at Bombay is . coming to Muscat shortly to wind up the affairs of the French coal depot and the French Consulate, presumably after he has gone there will be no French or American representative in the place and the levy question will not excite comment. As the present detachment at Muscat is, I understand shortly to be relieved, no one will I presume take exception to the new detachment arriving with arms etc any more than when last May the existing detachment went to Muscat. Would it not be poumjds possible therefore if this view is correct for volunteers from the Seistan corps for the Muscat levy to be collected and organised as a unit somewhere in Baluchistan near their present headquarters and brought as a unit with arms revolvers ammunition etc to relieve the detachment early in the New Year via Karachi to Muscat ? The latter could leave with all its arms etc as a unit. There would seem to be no more reason to objectin to arms being brought to Muscat in this way than of Indian troops there is whenever one detachment relieves another, if the matter could be arranged in this way.s * From Foreign Delhi / \ \ To Seistan, Buehire and Muaca^ No.52/S ia^l 12/1/21.

From Trevor Buehire To Wingate Muscat D/0 No.141 dated 22/1/21. I suggested the employment of a B.O. myself though you did not recommend it in your original proposals as I thought especially if the Government of India would lend one, tnat it would be advisable. Do you think tnat Muscat finances can afford one now that G of I say that they will not lend one ? Do you think one essential in the circumstances ? perhaps if Beistan have a thoroughly good Baluchi officer who is considered calable of running the snow, the B.O. might simply bring the men iown get them installed and the corps started and then return to Seistan, though I think that the corps would have a better chance if a B.O. were in charge at first. Telegram p. From Wingate Muscat To Trevor Bushire D/0 No.141 dated 26/1/21. There is a great deal of organisation to be done and the presence of a B.O. on the spot will be necessary though myself and the O.C. troops will do our best Therefore I am sure you are right that for the start a 3.0. will be essential. After that I consider that the corps should be run by natives but that the state can and must afford a B.O. for six months.Telegram P. From political Muscat To Resident Bushire No.146 dated 27/1/21. Rs.26500/- is the Initial cost of the arms and equipment. In view of the fact that in March the state will in addition to paying the troops have to meet the cost of their transport which will presumably be more than Rs.10000/-, subject to your approval I suggest that Muscat pays the money in five equal instalments of Rs.530C/- beginning the 1st April.

This will only represent the cost of rifles bayonet® ammunition webequipment necessaries and other sundry articles required to complete the men to scale as they are already in possession of field service kit given them by Government. (2) Up to 31st March 1921-1922 the cost of reserve clothing and equipment, all of which is being taken from Seistan, will be Rs.11500/-. After that calculating at current arsenal prices recurring expenditure on above clotning equipment and repairs will be Rs.17000/-. (3) My budget shows the following heads of expedditure.

Dnning the current year the expenditure is estomate! at rs.156000/-, so we are well within our budget estimate which was some Ra*40000/- more* For a whole year in wnich replacements of clothing etc have to be supplied the expenditure is estimated at Rs*218000/r. It really should not be as much as that as the salary list Includes the pay of a B.O. who will not be there. On the other hand the numbers may be Increased an! I have made no allowance for the Journey expenses of tuose going on leave beyond 'miscellaneous (2) What about the Indian regiment 1 The whole point of haring this levy is that that we should be ab^.e to do without our own regiment, t I certainly think that arrangements should be made, if all gees well to xakfcftXK send away our regiment not immediately ®n the arrival of the levy but three months -later, say at the end ef June. I am net such a fool to say that I am sure that it will be all right, but at present it looks as if it would be, and in any case we certainly ought to try i$. (3) This again raises the question of the location of the levies. Obviously the best place for them to oe put is 'Bait-al-FalaJ where the troops are at present, when the latter £•. There is a large fort which is the present »ess ani officers quarters, ani excellent pucca barracks capable of accomodating much more than the present proposed levies. The levies could go into this en bloc when the troops go. Of course I do not know what Government will do about the money they have spent on all these things, I imagine all they actually can do is to hand the whole thing over to the Sultan's government as they cannot claim a penny from the Sultan's government from them and of course it would cost far more than they are worth to remove them to India. There will however be an anormous amount to do saving what money is possible to Government, so I think if you agree to the principle, that Government ought to be approached at once. Incidentally there is an excellent electric light plant and engine which might be taken over by us for the Consulate and offices. Till then I am arranging to put the levies in Watayah, where we can make temporary arrangements with tents ani huts. The native officers can use the Sultan's house there and the B.O. can live with the Indian regiment which la only a mile and a half off. But the exact arrangements to be made of course largely depend on whether I know for certain that the regiment will be leaving in June ; they can then be of the most temporary kind. Sven then they will mean a lot of work on the part bf the O.C. troops and myself. The arab is about the greatest blank at a baniobast I have eves known. You will see fron the above how necessary it will be to have a B.O. for six months. The organisation and taking over will £ake quite that. Will you pet rae know by wire what you think about this ?

Muscat is an Independent state, and as long as you are here theoretically you are the servant of the oultan, though of course nothing can be done without the P.A's advice. A lot of the levies work will be by sea. For instance communication between Muscat and Muttrah wnere the levies are . stationed and which is only thr^e mll«s away is by sea. For this purpose Muscat has ordered a very fine big sea going motor boat which has Just been launcned by Hermans at Ks.rachfc.

All that will be necessary is when the crew arrive to go to Hermans after having got in touch with the Port Trust people and naving satisfied yourself after consultation with the Port Trust engineer that tne boat is up to specification, is in good running order, ana is fully supplied with all spare parts etc, and tnat Hermans have provided two engineers and a navigator on reasonable terms and tnat the boat Is ready to start, to take over the boat on behalf of the Muscat govera- -ment, and then see Uiat it goes off and wire Muscat.

The chief point to be consiierei in this is the question of taking over an! of the iisposal of surplus mate ial The levy corps are not a British force an! therefore ohere is no question of haniing over. They will simply go into the • ^ quarters formerly occupie! by the Iniian troops, presumably government strippei of most of the iisposable articles. The Muscat in 1h e present nerlo! of financial stringency is quite unable to make any offer for the builiings erected for the troops which Government will have to make a present of to Muscat. In fact beyond the actual cost of the arms an! equipment already indicated Muscat cannot pay an anna besides. It must therefore be very carefully considered by the military autnoritles what tilings they can dispose of and wnzt things they will simply have to hand over as it will cost far more than they are worth to remove them. The Important question then for them to decide is whether they will leave the Sikhs to do this or whether they will leave an officer on special duty with say fifty men to finish things up. My personal opini n is tnat the Sikhs should do what they can arranging to leave with all the transport etc some time in May, and an officer should be left with fifty men to finish everytning up. The question of the removal of the electric light plant and fittings will ha*&gt;e to be considered and an R.E.* \ officer will have to come from Busnire or Karachi as soon as possible for this purpose* Finally I ara under the impression tnat the General Staff have quite forgotten the question of the Consular guard* This is twenty five men and an Indian Officer* The levy corps being a Muscat force cannot supply-this, and even it it were possible to waive this technical objection wnich is of course impossible in addition to being highly inadvisable from the politiaal point of view, the levy corps nave not sufficient men to supply it* Formerly I think this was always supplied once a month or so from one of the regiments stationed at Karachi• This point needs settlement* 0 P*A.Muscat* i 1Telegram P.

This corps wos brought to Muscat tor two ram reasons, (*) To provide a means of defence for the state gainst itsenemies, in particular against the Oman tribes from whose attacks the coast towns were never xfe safe unless as was tne c'-sevitn Muscat and Muttrah they were protected by Indian troops* (2) n To enable us to withdraw our regiment which -.ve were maintaining at great expense for the defence of the Sultan in Muscat and Muttrah. At the time the proposal was brought forward it was pointed out that the local material was unreliable, and that a nucleus of the corps would have to be brought from outside. If this nucleus proved successful it would be possible to take in hand the recruitment oi local men* Captain McCarthy', report giv =&gt;3 in detail the history of the corps up to date. In addition to improving ■he condition and efficiency of the diatan contingent m most remarkable and successful manner, he has beenv^\ @ able even at this early date to cormence the recruitment of local material, and his efforts in this direction have been attended by success which is as amazing as it is unexpected. He draws the conclusion for reasons which he has given at length, that the eventual replacement of the majority if not of all of the Sistan contingent ia Xha by local material is the goal to be aimed at* I myself have inspected the Corps at Bait- al-F&amp;laj, and the condition of the men, their general fitness, their admirable discipline, and the general arrangements and interior economy reflect the greatest credit upon the leadership and efficiency of their commandant, to whose singlehanded efforts tMs condition of ffairs is entirely due. The discipline and enthusiasm of the two sections which have been locally recruited are however a still greater tribute to him* It is sufficient to say that I would not have believed such a change from the undisciplined and idle mob who ^orired the Sultan’s old so-called army possible, and the change in the attitude of the inhabitants towards service in the army is sufficiently emphasised by 'he itxi fact that there is already a iix waiting list of over fifty names. Saiyid Salim, one of the Sultan’s brothers' joined the corps as a jainadar'on July 1st* 8e is now a keen and efficient officer, has improved xxau greatly in physique and character, and could not be recognised for the idle and degenerate person he was a few months ago. Others of the Sultan’s family are anxious to join, I have emphasised these points in order to show that the scheme of gradually replacing the Sis tanis by local material, in addition to being the obvious one from a political and econonic standpoint, is actually a practical proposition* I entirely endorse Captain McCarthy’s proposals in this connection.In view of the feet that th&gt; malarial season is approaching,, which will be the real teat as to whether the Sistania can stand the Muscat climate, and of the necessity for Captain McCarthy 1 guiding hand in the recruitment and training of the first batches of local men, I venture to approach you with the request that j ou will obtain the Loan of Captain McCarthy’s services for the Muscat state for another six months from the 1st September* The council oi Ministers have already approached mo with this request and Captain McCarthy has informed me that he is willing to stay on if Governmont will spare him. hi^h commendation* And i forward al''o with the strongest recommendation his proposals for the recognition by Government of the services of his Indian Officers. I have the honour to be Sir, your most obedient servant 4 Political Agent t Muscat.Bait al F&amp;laj B'rom:- Commandant Mascat Levy Cor A u9 3th 3ept 1921. To:- The Political Agent and H.B.M’s Consul MASCAT. Sir, I have the honour to report herewith on the working of the Mascat Levy Corps for the period 18th February 1?2 1 to 3 ist August 1921 toother witn a report on the expenditure incurred during that period:- F ORMATIQkU Mascat Levies were recruited inSistan as and from the j8th February 1921 and as iar as possiolel enlisted the men on the lines followed by,the gistan Levy Corps namely by tribes through their various Baluch biruars. I was indented to Birdar Khudadad Khan, tribe Gurgich of Khawajamed from whom the maiority of the men were recruited for the personal • I _ t ^ T-4.V, •Jirt 4- a ti ^ -f -1 -n n f* 4*. Vi a A TO nr asistance gi^en by him in the selection of the men for Mascat- The establishment previously decided upon .no. other ranks .ns true to viz rs 1, 3 3.0. 5, Indian Officers a**- Baluch Jemadars, 12 Daffadars, 12 Naiks and 21? bepoys enabled me to form the men into 3 troops oi 30 men,each commanded by a Baluch Officer and furthermore each Troop was split up into 4 sections of 20 men, eadh section commanded by a Daffadar- I would point out that recruitment for the Mascat Levies commenced at an unfavourable time viz-,close dep fact however Gener -aL^Er£gxe.gJ- Lavias left Sistan on the 28th February ana owing to miles in 7 days which was a severe task for men unaccustomed to marching, despite this handicap they arrived at^railhead in good condition. Karachi was reached on the litn March and as you are aware owing to an outbreak of measles ana later the difficulty in obtaining transport to Mascat we were defined in Karachi until the l?tn April ^ when the force embarked on the B.B. Chakdara*- 1 which arrived at Mascao # on tne 19th of that month- Whilst in Karachi the men were comfortably auartered in.the Rest Gamp and I was able to carry 0'^ preliminary training ana route marches. Jn arrival at Ifescat the Levies proceeded to V/at ay ah where you naa prepared a very excellent camp. Owing to the malaria season being in full swing I was greatly handicapped as regards training by the large number of malaria cases ana also for want of a suitable ground for elementary training owin^ to the sandy nature of the country there. elementary Field Training and Field Operations were however carried out with quite a measure of success. I would mention that for political reasons the Bistan Levies were only given a moderate training thus a thorough preliminary training wa was ure i this I was hie to do*on the departur ? rom Bait al Falaj on the 23rd of June what was required ana of the 2/35th Bikhs f when the Levies immediately took possession of that place. Bait al Falaj proved an agreeable change alter two very . tryingin? trying months spant under canvas at Watayah. malaria # practically ceased and with the exception of boils * sickness to date had. practically disappeared. dait ax &lt;a x good quarters , a good training ground ana. an ex^ell^nt ran^t rapid progress all round has oeen made by th^) uevies^ano. p , with the exception of night operations and Field Firing wnicn will be carried out in tSe cool season tne men nave nad quite a fair training. The discipline is excellent ana up ,o aate only two cases 'ofGonorrhoea have been recorded. Relation^ with the Local Authorities.are excellent and no complaints have been made by them against # the men* The Levies are provided with an excellent Regimental shop ana are well equipped with,footballs and hockey sticks which help .0 reap the men occupied and in good condition* 1 2-LGIAiI -MUTLilGSliT. Owing to the severe outbreak of malaria on arrival at Watayah I 'found it necessary to discharge 17 men 01 the ^is tan contingent who had developed complicauions ana one man died thus reducing my strength to of all ranks* x t is'as yet too early to afesure the complete success 0 . the Sistan Detachment but personally i,am of the opinion tn&amp;t eventually it will be oetter to eliininat»e the^Sis^tan elemenjt and rely on local material and if' enough men cannot be ^ recruited locally we should look nearer home for the numoer^ to maVe the Goros up'to strength* I understand thatyqui^e a £r 0 od class of men can be obtained from Banderabast viz., ¥an^siri Tribe; they were recruited in the Bouth fersian plffes and did very well* My chief reasons ^or tne eventual elimination or the Bis tan Contingent are:- , S ■ (o) Tenure of Service* hen are nominally enlisted for three K } years as TTtwrii be readily understood that once phey proceed on leave we have absolutely no control over, them * it will be impoadole to assure their return to Mas cat* the (b) Clim atic conditions* As is only too well known w. ^ climatic conditions here are none too tavouraole ^or outsiders juddng from the experiences 01 all the inaian Regiments that have been stationed here and the haluch who dreads sickness will not be too ha*jpy m the malarious season- fa} C ost of the Force. This is an item which might eventually 'cause 'the state some anxiety if for instance .here should be a bJig trade aepression or the lailure oi the 'date crop* The cost of sending tne men on iea/e is also a large item roughly about Rupees 10,000* (d) hi stance f rom Masa gJi* The distance of .-istan from ^scat require? 50 }isid,eratjop_.__ A,.party nroc^eaina: on ^wo. rnon u n ' ““ 11 ce aoseno h 1 aave will 'oe aoseno irore Muscat Vouglily_ 1 our months allowing for the journey both ways, and ih case Oi war during She leave period it is extremely difiicult to recall the men- The arrangements for sending leave , darties are great and the' fact that ^ understana it is prooosed to abolish the f’est tamp at Karachi will necessitate other arrangemnts being made for th r ir su-y there on return from leave and pending embarkation* * \ Besides the above items undoubtedly,tha chief reason oi my anxiety for the future of the Levies 'and the one which prompted me to enlist locally is that when my services here are dispensed with undoubtedly not more than b5/c of the men viH be willing to remainand wnen they go on leave will not return.

It would however oe a great pity to scrap the 3 Mauser Bore Guns mentioned above as many of the men have a good knowledge of same and they would be very useful for ) I would be glad if a further effort could Machine working the Motor Cruiser(4) be made to obtain ammunition for same. 1 understand that Aden is a likely place to obtain some. Regarding duns I have one 9 pounder K.I.L. which is an excellent7s un for dersnce.of Bait al Falai but is useless for outside operations as it is^ not very portable.

Bait al Fel&amp;j. 8th Sept Sir, In bringing to your notice the names of the undermantione ^en of the Masoat Levy Corps 7ho belong to regular units of the Indian Army, may I point out that It is al-vays the case of men who are seconded from their units they are overlooked for promotion. Of course it cannot be denied X'xxt but that they have gained from a monetary .oint of view :* n taking employment outside their units,“ however it r w- t be remembered that promotion in the Levies is only temporary and in the case of Jemadars i r athe Khan and Nias All'if they relinquish their appointments here they have to revert to the ranks and both have held commissioned rank in the Sis tan Levies for soma years. They are all picked men of undoubted ability who have done excellent work in both the Hiflt&amp;n and Hascat Levies and I would be very pleased to see their services appreciated. Rio I'ajor Badshah Hussein, Jemadars Fatah Kha' and Niaz All and Head Clerk Liakat iili are all men cf long service and pensionable and I suggest that if a Higher Rank oe given these man they may be put oh the^pension establishment to which they would be ogreeable. In the case of Raff Major Abdul Ali his services might receive some appreciation. Risaldar Major Badshah Hussein. (Ressoidar In 3rd Skinners Horse) Hy second in command.

The proposed Levy is to be commanded, armed, paid and equipped through British or Indian officers. The primary object for the proposed Levy Corps is to enable the withdrawal of the Indian troops at present garrisoning in the towns of Muscat and Matrah and the regular troops at Bait el-Falaj [Bayt al-Falaj], and to replace them with a locally raised force sufficient to assert the Sultan’s authority and defend his capital against rebellious tribesmen.British Officials discussed the importance of obtaining an undertaking from the Sultan of Muscat and Oman not to arrange any treaties with foreign powers without the agreement of His Majesty’s Government. They also discussed the export of arms by the Sultan and the conditions of the arms traffic convention.The file includes copies of proclamations issued by the Sultan of Muscat and Oman regarding the establishment of an armed force of artillery and infantry to be recruited from the coastal towns in the immediate neighbourhood of Muscat, mainly, Matrah, Riyam, Kalbu, Sidab, and Mutairah. The proclamations include the law of enrolment in the local Levy Corps. The correspondence in the file also includes copies of a 'Scheme with Estimates for Raising and Maintaining a Levy Corps for Muscat' prepared by the Political Agent, Muscat.The main correspondents in the file are: the Political Agent, Muscat; the Political Resident, Bushire; the Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department; and the Inspector General, Imperial Service Troops, Simla.Most of the correspondence in the file is dated 1913-1921 apart from folio 241 which is a note page dated 12 February 1935.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00029a#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
