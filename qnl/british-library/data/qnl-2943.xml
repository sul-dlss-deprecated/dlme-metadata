In this letter, Bruce informs Thompson that the
                           Dolphinbugulah [buggalow] proceeds to Rasselkhyma with water supplies. Bruce states that a cooper also proceeds to Rasselkhyma, on board the
                           Elizacountry ship. Bruce adds that Mr Spence, Commander of the
                           Dolphin, has been directed to stop at the Island of Khen [Qeys] in order to fill up as much water as he possibly can. Bruce regrets that he was not able to arrange for the
                           Liverpoolto touch at Rasselkhyma. He encloses a statement with vouchers (not included).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054291.0x000039#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
