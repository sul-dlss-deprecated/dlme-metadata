Copy No. A summar-y or evidence available from the files of the Political Resi dency, Bahrain, in support of tne claims of Qatar, A'ou Dhabi and Muscat to the areas on their side of the boundary lines with Saudi Arabia as defined bi Kis I.lajest;;’ s Government ‘ in the negotiations co.;r enoing with the Riyadh talks in September, 1949. Such evidence as is available falls into the following four categories:- (A) Facts which are common knowledge. (B) The testimony of independent witnesses. (C) Evidence of unimpeded commercial user of the areas in guestion. (D) Evidence of other acts. 2. It is realised that category (a) to some extent begs the guestion, but with material available so scarce it is necessary to use every shred. 3. The States concerned are of course Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Muscat, and the evidence in the categories mentioned is presented below in respec t of each of these areas. That for Khor al ’Odaid and Jsbel Uakhsh is given separately, the Justification for this being that these areas were focal points in the 1935-39 negotiations and, because of their situation, still to a large extent remain s^. ► The latter is also true of Buraimi which, is also treated separately.

People from V/akrah still visit the lihor in winter to catch fish for sale in Do hah. Abu Dhabi fishermen still visit the khor but they never make any settlements as hore, although in October 1950 a survey party from p. D. (r. C. ) found a family of Abu Dhabi (? Beni Has) fishermen in what appeared to be a semi-permanent encampment near Imshash well on the north side of the Jabal al Odaid.

He is the only traveller from outside Arabia who has visited this area. (ii) The Murra tribe do not move east of Sabhkat Matti. The lianasir and Beni Yas who occupy the area from Batin and Liwa to the coast are more or less stationary; as their camels feed on the salt bush of the area, and have to benatered frequently.
