My dear Clauson, Your letter P.Z. 5495/36 of September 15th about SS== :=s= ^ =% ' the Draft King’s Regulation and proclamation to regulate the possession of, and traffic in, arms in Bahrain. *2 The drafts have been examined by Fitzmaurice (in the absence of Beckett) and he has thought it necessary to make a number of amendments in The King's Regulation for reasons which are explained hereunder. I have embodied these amendments in a fair draft a copy of which I enclose. If you agree with them we can go ahead with the formal steps of allowing The King's Regulation. ^ It is usual to schedule the text of the local law made applicable to British subjects or other persons under British jurisdiction, so we have inserted a reference to the Schedule in paragraph 1. ^ On the assumption that it is intended to issue the Proclamation and The King's Regulation simultaneously. M. J. Clauson, Esq. Rim. POL B£?T. 1 OCT 1936 INDIA OFFICE -it/. P'CLOSURE IN WEEKLY LETTER 41 -8 OCT 1936 -■ L ^IZTa.x p, rOwi.ilAL AND _CdLl DEPT. INDIA OFFICEit may be preferable though perhaps not strictly necessary to substitute in The King f s Regulation the word 'Regulation” for 'Proclamation' in the proposed amendments to Article 5 of the Proclamation. We have made this amendment leaving it to you to adopt or not as you see fit. Agent in exceptional circumstances to grant a permit for the import or export of arms, what this regulation purports to do is to apply the local law to persons subject to the Bahrain Order-in-Council with certain amendments. The provision under discussion is an amendment of the law in question. It is in fact an additional provision. Consequently it ought not in our view, to be set out as a separate paragraph 2, but to be set out as No. (vii) in the anendments listed in paragraph 1. There also appears to be some confusion in the concluding words of this paragraph 2 of the India Office draft. Is it not sufficient simply to refer to Article 6 without stating that it is Article 6 of the Proclamation as modified in The King’s Regulation? What the Regulation is doing is in fact to modify the Proclamation, before making it applicable to permitting the Political persons/persons subject to the Bahrain Order-in-Council, Article 6 is therefore already modified and all that appears necessary is simply a reference to Article 6, Then paragraph 3 of the India Office draft seems to convey a false impression. In the first place, it reads as if forfeiture was not provided for in the Proclamation, but actually it is. This paragraph, therefore does not add to the penalties provided for in the Order and, in our opinion, might well be omitted. In that case the penalty provision of the Proclamation will automatically apply as it stands to any person subject to the Bahrain Order-in- Council. All that is necessary is to renumber the provision in question in viev/ of the insertion of the new article (i.e. the article about import and export permits). Similarly Article 15 will require renumbering. There is however one point about the penalty article whibh puzzles us. It seems to us that Article 71 of the Order-in-Council prescribes the maximum penalty that may be imposed for a breach of a King f s Regulation but that this maximum, which in the case of imprisonment is three months, applies even where the King*s Regulation enforces a local law imposing a greater penalty. At least this seems to be the/— — '— H * *the implication of Article 71(3) under which the maximum fine that could be inflicted as there provided, could not, it would seem, be exceeded even if the local law prescribed a greater maximum. prescribes imprisonment up to one year and a fine up to 2,000 Rupees. Is there not therefore a conflict between this and the Order-in~Council and do you not want to provide in the Regulation that the penalty article shall be deleted and that the penalties prescribed in the Order- in-Council shall apply? t The English text of the Proclamation will be set a schedule. Perhaps, it should, strictly speaking, be called an English translation instead of text. If you prefer, the word 'translation' would be substituted for 'text' in paragraph 1. //) The remaining amendments are, I think, self- explanatory. There is one further point. King’s Regulations often state that any offences thereunder shall be triable only in British Consular Courts and not in any other Courts. V/e notice that the proclamation in this case As/As however the Arms Ordinance contains no specific statement that offences under that Ordinance shall he triable in the local courts and as persons subject to the Bahrain Order-in-Council are thereby placed under the jurisdiction of British courts and are in any event not subject to local jurisdiction it is probably unnecessary to say anything about it.(£) 1 Revised draft .

Sale or attempted sale seems to me the major offence the remaining offences under King's Regulation ho. 1 of 1930 seem to be of comparatively lesser importance. The Indian Penal Code provides adequate punishment for the former; and having regai'd to the fact that offenuers are more likely to be petty dealers than the large pearl merchants, the Order in Council provides adequate punishment for the latter. 4. 1 am averse in principle from introducing amendments 9 $fa.

This Regulation may be cited as the Possession and Traffic in Arms Regulation, 1936.Mr. Clauson , Bahrain Arms Proclamation and King’s Regulation . We had a brief conversation on this to-day. It would, of course, make things simpler if there was only one controlling authority, either the Bahrain Government or the Political Agent, Bahrain, for all the persons affected by the proposed Law. Under the Order- in-Council, however, Bahrainis come under the Bahrain Government and British and foreign subjects come under the jurisdiction of the Political Agent. This being so, and as a matter of principle and to keep our extra-territorial rights, we should, I think, make the Bahrain Government the authority for dealing with their subjects, and the Political Agent for British and foreign subjects. At present we have a complacent Sheikh who listens to our advice, but we cannot count on this for all time and it is important to retain our special privileges. With this consideration in mind, I think that the King’s Regulation will have to be again lengthened•*-us.V (it has been shortened once) and Articles included to the following effect Paragraph 5 of the Proclamation: for 'Government of Bahrain 11 read 'Political Agent'. Paragraph 6 of the Proclamation: the first sentence should be omitted, and for the word 'Fort' the words 'Political Agency' to be substituted. The charge of Re.l for each licence could stand and an addition could be made that licences issued by the Political Agent should be taken to the Chief of Police for registration. Paragraph 10 of the Proclamation: for 'Bahrain Government' and 'Chief of Police' read 'Political Agent'. Paragraph 11 of the Proclamation: for 'Chief of Police' read 'Political Agent'. Paragraph 12 of the Proclamation: for 'Bahrain Government' read 'Political Agent'. Paragraph 13 of the Proclamation: for 'Chief of Police' read 'Political Agent'. In addition to the general considerations given in paragraph 1 of this Note, a further reason for the /-X -V 3. the Political Agent having control over the licensing etc., of arms, is that should any British subject or foreigner break the Arms Regulations, or be engaged in any affray in which arms are used, it is the Political Agent and not the Bahrain Government who has to deal with them. We might discuss this Note again^ c^cCTTr ( fa* M ^** ‘T^r &gt;^) Colonel Fowle, Here are the draft Bahrein Arms Proclamation and King*s Regulation in thaipresent form, with a short Note. If you concur in them as revised, shall we show them to Mr.Belgrave ? We could then send them across to the Foreign Office in the hope of getting final approval. The procedure will presumably be for the ' A'Cartw' Banrein Government to issue the ir—few and forward a copy as issued, with date; the Foreign Office will then 'allow' the King’s Regulation.P.Z.5495/36. Minute Paper. Department. — NOTE. As a result of further examination and consultation with the Foreign Office and India Office Legal Advisers, the Draft Kings Regulation and Draft S^ulation have again been revised. The following notes willexplain the changes. 1. It is unnecessary to make the Proclamation and the King*s Regulation cover the same ground twice. It would be in accordance with normal practice in regard to ex-territorial countries to set out the necessary rules in the Proclamation and to have a brief King’s Regulation (to w hich the Proclamation is an annex) applying the rules set out in the Proclamation with any necessary modifications to persons subject to the Order in Council. The drait King's Regulation has been shortened accordingly. 2. Article 2 oi the new draft King's Regulation makes it clear that firearms imported under special authorisation from the Political Agent shall be treated in the same way as firearms already in the country - i.e. their possessors must obtain a license from the Chief of police. 3. A new Article (7; has been added to the Proclamation in order to make plain (what is already implicit) that it is an oifence to possess firearms without a license. l 4. A new article (10) has been added to the Proclamation as it seems desirable to deal in a separate article with the revocation of licenses. It will be seen jthat revocation will rest entirely with the Bahrein government. Unless there is any local objection this seems preierable to dividing the power of revocation between the Bahrein Government and the Political Agent. 2956 6000 7/315. Article 11 (new draft) das been verbally altered on the suggestion of the India Office Legal Adviser. 6. The Legal Advisor has pointed out that there is no prohibition against the wearing or carrying of bayonets and spears. If the local authorities do not think; this satisfactory, it will only be necessary to substitute ”the wearing of carrying of arms' for'the wearing of daggers and carrying of swords.” 7. A table is attached summarising the effect of the Proclamation in its revised form.10./ . o proclaination . Arms Ordinance - 1354. 1.

This Regulation may be cited as 'The Possession and Traffic in Arms Regulation, 1936Legal Adviser , This file was last referred to you at P.Z.463/36 We have since received the comments of Mr. Beckett at P.Z.1400/36. I have now attempted a redraft of the draft Proclamation and King^ Regulation in order to meet some of his criticisms. I think the last paragraph of his minute is pertinent and the method proposed hy him will avoid the repetition involved in the previous drafts. To take in the first place the draft Proclamation. The main alterations I have made are as follows: (1) The provisions of the original draft were arranged in a somewhat haphazard fashion and I have tried to rearrange them on what seems a more logical basis. (2) I have added a new clause 7« (3) In view of this clause and of clause I have shortened clause 14 (clause 12 of the old draft). The other points which require reconsideration appear to be the following: (a) The provisions as regards the possession and carrying of'arms' are somewhat vague, as the majority of the clauses deal only with firearms. It might at any rate be desirable to specify the authority from whom permission can be obtained to wear daggers and carry swords. The Chief of Police seems to be the obvious authority, and I have made an addition accordingly. (b) The question of revoking licences. I think it is probably desirable to have a separate clause to this effect so that it is possible to specify what to do with . irearms in respect of which the licence has been revoked, 1/2. I have therefore added a fresh claus It will perhaps also he necessary to consider whether we ought to specify the offences for which a licence may he revoked* (c) I have tentatively included in the draft Proclamation the provision whereby the proposed legislation will not apply to arms, firearms or ammunition imported for the purposes of His Majesty f s Government, hut perhaps this ought more properly to go into the King f s Regulation. To turn now to the draft King’s Regulation. I have tried to keep this as short as possible and it may he necessary to enlarge it. On the whole, however, I see no objection to the persons subject to the Bahrein Order in Council conforming in all respects with the procedure and rules laid down in the Proclamation. As all licences will he issued by the Chief of Police I can see no reason for giving the Political Agent power to revoke such licences. It will, of course, he necessary to consult the Political Resident on the provisions in general, and the points mentioned above in particular, hut I should he very grateful for any observations which you may care to offer at this stage.(E 653/37/91) S' 1 / f; n * '• T' \..t -! n o --i FOREIGN 0 t 24th February, 1936 Dear Glauson, Would you please refer to your official letter No.PZ 463/36 of 4th February on the subject of the draft King 1 s Regulation and Proclamation to regulate the possession of and traffic in arms in Bahrain. Beckett has gone carefully into the draft of the King’s Regulation and I enclose a copy of his minute as well as copies of the Morocco Regulations to v/hich he refers. Perhaps you would like to consider any amendments in the light of his suggestions, before we send a formal reply to your official letter. \ E2CLOSURE 1M WEEKLY LETTER t ;0. 2 7FEB 1936 from eicniT,: &gt;, folit.oal a*k&gt; M. J. Glauson, Esq. » I FT. liiulA OFFICE 00.-7 GENT TOI am afraid that the terms of the Regulation and proclamation require a little further consideration yet. I will only deal with the Regulation hut it is probable that most of the observations apply mutatis mutandis to the Proclamation also. Article 3 now gives a power to the political resident to grant a licence for the importation of arms etc. (puery v'hether he should not have a power to grant a licence for their export also. What is however to be the position as regards arms in Bahrein imported under a licence given under this article? Is the licence to import to be deemed to be also a licence to possess in Bahrein equivalent to that which is given by the Government of Bahrein under article 5? Further n tins is supposed to be the case presumably such arras should be numbered and registered etc. Article 5, the second line, Regulation obviously must be substituted for Proclamation. The Regulations seem to me to require an article stating expressly (what is now implicit) that it is forbidden to possess arms etc. in respect of which no licence has been issued. According to what is done on the point in connection with article 3 on which I have already observed, this new article might refer to licences issued by the Government of Bahrein under article 5 or those issued by the political resident'under article 3 (it is to be noticed that the authorities for giving Licences anu permission are already somewhat various. It is the political resident under article 3, the Government of Bahrein under article 5, acting apparently through the Chief of Police, and a= regards the revocation at the end of article 6 it is the political agent. ifIf the political agent is 'being given a power to revoke licences (query whether this applies only to licences issued under article 5 or whether it applies also to those issued under article 3) some provision must he made as to what is to happen with regard to the arms when the licence to possess them has been revoked. As things stand it will be forbidden to export them and forbidden to transfer them and forbidden to keep them. The man whose licence is revoked can presumably only drop them in the bottom of the sea, but is it right to give the political agent in this way power to take away from a man who has not been convicted of any offence what may be in money a fairly valuable property? I am afraid this point wants further consideration. I think it might be suggested also to the India Office that in a case such as this a more convenient method is to draft the Government of Bahrein’s law or Proclamation containing the rules which apply to native subjects then make a King’s Regulation to which the Government of Bahrein’s law is an annex. The King’s Regulation in these cases makes the ex-Bahrein jurisdiction and adds such additional provisions as may be necessary to complete or modify the Regulation for the purposes of its application to these persons. This is the normal way o: dealing with local legislation in ex-territorial countries and it might conveniently be followed in Bahrein. One or two specimens of l orocco King’s Regulations are annexed as an illustration of the way in which these things are usually done.&lt;K M O R O C C O (SPANISH ZONE). NOTICE.

Department. h:z 7l h j^ 3939 5000 7/35 Le^al Adviser . Will you please refer to your Note of the 5th November. A reply has now been received in answer to the first point you raised £ please see P.Z.9313/35] As the words firearms* and , ar^Ils , are closely defined in the first two Articles of the regulations, it seems to me desirable to be very careful about their use in subsequent Articles. In^aragraph 13 which ^ /.U /tifcr *1' Tz pli/X)' Colonel Loch suggests^should be included in the regulations, he omits the word 'firearm^. I cannot believe that this omission is deliberate as it is clearly probable that H.M.G. may at some moment desire to import rifles, etc. Presumably, Colonel Loch rogarehe the word 'arms* in paragraph 3 as an inclusive term and iirbeuicfod that firearms also, in exceptional circumstances, should be imported. I think, therefore, that in each of these two Articles it is desirable to add firearms. You will also notice that the provisions of Article 5 onwards provides only for licences for firearms and not, therefore, for arms. I do not think this omission is really serious as there is no particular reason why officials at Bahrein should possess swords, bayonets, etc., for other purposes than that of official dress or uniform. As at present drafted, the King's Regulation and the Proclamation which is to be issued by the Bahrein * Government provide for different penalties. I assume that there is no objection to this. In the hope that you will agree with my views on the three points above, I have submitted a redraft of the regulations and a draft letter to the Foreign Office asking them to allow the regulations, in which your concurrence is requested. ^ ( v ' ^■■■■ —ti t—M Draft Paper.

K? p f Cultured pearls. v • ; V V. h yw I have the honour to enclose a translation of a letter from His Excellency Shaikh sir Hamad bin *lsa A1 Khalifah, Huler of Bahrain, to the Political Agent, Bahrain, in which he asks that steps may be taken to safeguard the^earl trade in the Persian Gulf from the danger of the importation of cultured pearls by enhancing the punishment which can be infl under the provisions of the Bahrain Order enlisting the cooperation of the other States of the Arab coast. I have since had an opportunity of discussing the matter both with His Excellency and with the Adviser to the Bahrain Govern ment. 2. It is almost impossible to tell cultured pearls from real pearls. Two examples of thie have come under my personal notice. I once asked three pearl merchants to examine a parcel of pearls in which there were suspected to be cultured pearls* they admitted themselves to be uncertain though they thought that the pearls were genuine. A prominent member of His majesty’s Government flew through Bahrain and at his request the political Agent sent a pearl merchant to the landing ground. He bought a number of very valuable pearls, but a few days later telegraphed from London to say that an expert had said that these were cultured pearls# He was requested to have the pearls tested by the Government Test Department and fortunately they proved to be genuine, 3. in view of the immense profits to be made by the importantion of even a few good cultured pearls, it is clear that a punishment of one year* a imprisonment and a fine of up to Rupees 2,000/- would be quite inadequate to deter a dishonest dealer. If a man is caught actually selling cultured pearls as real, he can be cted for this offence in Council and by2. deait^ with under section 420 of the Indian Penal Code, but it may not be easy to detect or to prove a case of this kind. It ia» therefore* desirable to lay down a much heavier punishment r for the offence of the imporation into Bahrain or of being in \ possession of cultured pearls* a s so doing would as a rule be only with the object of fraud. 4. The Bahrain Government are considering the purchase of a pearl testing machine* though the cost is* I understand* high. If this proves possible* the existence of the rrfcchine should serve to some extent as a deterrent to persons trying to pa ss cultured pearls as real, and would in any oa ee render certain the detection of cultured pearls in any doubtful case. 5. I recommend that the puniehmentjof five years* rigorous imprisonment suggested by His iixcellency may be adopted. I would* however* place no limit on the fine as cultured pearl representing fraudulent dealings of possibly lacs of rupees may be imported by a rich merchant to whom a limited fine would be of little consequence, ’foreover* a limit to the fine may in some cases preclude the possibility of repaying persons who have been defrauded. 6. I enclose a draft King’s Regulation and recommend that it should be issued. 7. His Sxcellency also suggests that steps should be taken to punish the introduction of cultured pearls into the other States of the Arab Littoral* Kuwait* ^atar and Truoial ’Oman. I entirely agree in principle and the Rulers of ^atar and the Trucial Shaikhs have already been warned in conversation of this danger to pearl trade. 8. I am sending a copy of this correspondence to the Political y Agent* Kuwait with the request that he will consult His Rxcellenc A Shaikh sir Ahmad bin jabir A1 sabah with a view to taking similar aotion to that which is proposed for Bahrain. t 9. The question of action on the Trucial Coast is more difficul but I hope to have an opportunity of consulting the various Truoial Shaikhs on a tour in October. 410. There would re:nain a gap on the Coast# that i e to say, the pearling centres of ga«udi Arabia. These centres are not of great importance, but it may baco ae necessary later on to seek the cooperation of the sa*udi Arab Government. 11. in the meantioe# I trust^Govemment will feel disposed to take the action proposed for Bahrain without waiting the result of enquiries elsewhere. Bahrain is the centre of the Pearl trade and action there will encourage the rulers of the Trucial Coast to take steps themselves. I would only add that the danger is a pressing one- if it once becomes thought that cultured pearls may be found ai^ed with the pearl catch of the Persian Gulf# the good name of the trade will receive a blow from which it may never recover. 12. This despatch was approved by Colonel Loch but he left on tour before it could be signed by him.ISi v ier no.

We are writing to you concerning a matter which ie of the greateet * importance to the people of Bahrain and to all the people in the 5ulf who earn their livelihood by diving for pearls. 2. During recent years the sale of cultured pearls hag damaged the markets in Europe and in India and has injured the diving industry in the Gulf. How however the danger has become even greater and nearer than before owing to the dishonest people who bring cultured pearls to the Gulf and mix them with real pearls by doing which they will ruin the reputation of the Gulf pearls. The r eeult of this will be that the value of pearls will decrease even more and our people will not be able to earn sufficient to support themselves for Bahrain depends on diving. 3. The sale of cultured pearls is forbidden in Bahrain but it can only £, be prevented if very sever/ punishment is inflicted on those dishonest people who ignore the law because the profit for selling cultured pearls as real pearls is very great. Foreigners are forbidden to possess import or sell cultured pearls according to the order in Council, but the maximum punishment according to this Order is only one year imprisonment or a fine of Rs. 2,0)0/-. We consider that this punishmsnt is not sufficient because the sale of cultured pearls in Bahrain is a matter which injures the whole community and also because the profits which dishonest people can make are very great. We think that the punishment should be five years imprisonment and a fine of Hs* 2,000/-. If this order were made in our opinion it would do much to prevent the sale of cultured pearls in Bahrain. 4. You are aware that Bahrain is today and has been for many years the centre of the diving industry in the Gulf. The Chief market i s in Bahrain and more ships and divers go out from Bahrain to the diving than from any other ports in the Gulf. Because of this we consider that we are entitled to speak on behalf of the whole diving community in the Gulf and we Ore sure that the Rulers of ail other diving states will approve of our opinion. We suggest and request that the law forbidding cultured pearls should be applied in all the States in the &gt;^ulf wnich- 2 - participate in diving such as Kuwait# qattar and Oman States. We think that if this can be done the reputation of the Persian Gulf pearls will be preserved but if no action is ta^en to prevent cultured pearls# except in Bahrain, the reputation of the Persian Gulf pearls will be lost and this will spoil the industry on which we and our neighbours have depended since the beginning of times. • *BAHR/U K.

Department. copy below apart from the addition of 5 words to para.10 Please see the letter of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf of 7th September on P.Z.6471 below, recommending the issue under Article 70 of the Bahrein Order in Council of 1913 of a King’s Regulation to provide for the regulation of the possession and traffic in arms in Bahrein. The Government of India have accepted his case for a Regulation, and have forwarded a revised draft for approval. 2. The revised draft of the Government of India is flagged. Its modification is confined to the exclusion of the specific penalties in para.12 of the Resident’s draft on P.Z.6471/35, on the grounds that sub-article ( 2 ) of Article 71 of .the Bahrein Order in Council (1913) already lays down penalties to secure the observance of Regulations made under Article 70, and precludes the inclusion in a Regulation of severer penalties. As regards procedure, please see para.3 of Mr. Laithwaite’s minute on P.2867/30, wherein it was proposed to transmit the draft King’s Regulation to the Foreign Office for formal approval or amendment, after the receipt of which this Office should proceed with the necessary instructions to Bushire and to India. A draft letter to the Foreign Office is submitted for consideration. J.A.C.R. 30/10/35. Legal rdviser Last time v/e had a King’s Regulation of this sort (P.2867/30) there was the same trouble over the Resident including penalties in his draft. On that occasion, as you will see, the Government of India gave no reasons for cutting/cutting the paragraph out, and vie could only speculate on them. On this occasion they are more precise. I presume you agree with their statement about Article 71(2) - they ought to add ( 3) - precluding the inclusion of the Resident para.12? . Ujrt cA^C c * /v — It P.2867/30 that so far as import and export are concerned, the penalties may he not only those in Article 71 for breach of a King's Regulation, but also those in Article 27 for illegal import or export. I take it this is so? If so, it may be worth mentioning it in our letter to the Foreign Office (of which a copy will go to India and the Gulf). Do you concur in the draft or have you any observations to offer?

Sir, I am directed 'by the S/S for India to forward, for the information of the S/S for Foreign Affairs, a copy of a letter dated the 9th October from the G. of I. enclosing a draft King’s Regulation limiting the possession and traffic in arms in Bahrein. A copy of the Political Resident’s letter No.704-S was '’orwarded to your Department on the 23rd September under No.P.Z.6471/35. 2. The Marquess of Zetland agrees with the G-. of I. that a Regulation on the lines now proposed is desirable, and that the provisions of sub-articles (2) and (3) of Article 71 of the Bahrein Order in Council, 1913, preclude the inclusion of a clause such as clause 12 of the Draft Regulation originally proposed by the Resident. His Lordship presumes, however, that in cases where arms have been imported or exported the offenders will be subject to the provisions of Article 27 of the Order in Council. 3. If Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare concurs in the terms of the draft Regulation, I am to ask that he will take steps formally to allow it and to cause this Office to beinformed, in order that the necessary intimation may be made to the G. of I. and to the Political Resident. 4 ./4. The Regulation will presumably he issued under Article 70 of the Order in Council,without reference, as proposed by the 0. of I., to a specific paragraph of the Article. I am to invite attention in this connection to prra.2 of Lord Monteagle’s letter dated the 29th May 1930, No.E 2722/2722/91.

Sir, I have the honour to recommend the issue of the enclosed draft King’s Regulation under Article 70 (b) and 70 (d) of the Bahrain order in Council to provide for the regulation of the possession, import, export and sale of arms, firearms, and ammunition in Bahrain. 2 9 Under a notification dated the 30th April 1893 Issued by the late shaikh Sir ’Isa bin *All Al Lhalifah, the import and export of arms into and from Bahrain is prohibited, but no rules have hitherto been framed to enforce the prohibition or to regulate the possession of arms. Though the notifica tion is enforced at the Customs House, it is easy for bedouin and others to bring arms with them if they l-nd at small places along the Coast and there is, therefore, little difficulty in the way of anyone obtaining firearms of sorts. 3. There have recently been two or three armed robberies amounting almost to attacks on villages and various crimes aggravated by casualties inflicted by lethal weapons. These crimes are usually carried out by wild foreigners, such as Hajdis, liasawls and so on. 4. /—-XA 2 * I The Bahrain Government Is now in a strong enough position to enforce simple rules for the regulation of the possession of arms and firearms and His Excellency Shaikh Sir haaad bin ’Isa Al KhaliCah is aiixious thut such rules the Government of Bahrain proposes to issue* The rules are simple and designed to suit the circumstances in which they are to be used} the object is principally to enable the Government of Bahrain Co deal with the wandering evil doer who is responsible for most of the violent crimes and there is no intention of depriving the respectable villager of his means of defence* In the interests of simplicity &amp;r*3 ease of working there is, for example, no provision for the renewal of licences annually, as it would necessitate much labour and trouble, and the person at whom the rules are aimed is the person without a licence* For the same reason, definitions do not specifically include such things as cannon, dynamite, which are unlikely to be obtainable by the local people* id others who visit Bahrain, as they can (as they already do) deposit their arms in the Customs House and receive them proposed rules to Bahrain subjects* The draft King’s Regulation will apply the rules to persons to whom the Bahrain Order in Council applies* It is proposed to issue both simultaneously* should be introduced* 5.

In reply, I am to inform you that Mr.Henderson concurs in the terms of the draft, subject to the substitution of 'article 70' for 'article 70(a)' in the heading of the Regulation. He is advised that the reference to a particular paragraph of article 70 of the Bahrein Order in Council is unnecessary, and that, since the proposed regulation might be regarded as coming under paragraph (b) of article 70 as well as under paragraph (a), it is undesirable to specify the latter paragraph. It is understood drom oral discussion between members of the Foreign Office and of the India Office, that the Secretary of State for India is prepared to agree to this amendment. 3.

P. 2867, about the draft King** Regulation under the Bahrein Order in Council to prohibit certain kinds of traffic m pearls. have referred you, on the question of penalties, to the provisions of Article 71(2) and (3) of the Bahrein ' rder in Council. To prevent any misunderstanding, it would perhaps be as well to say that we considered the desirability of making some reference to the powers granted by Article 27 of the Order in Council to impose certain penalties. After consideration, however, it seemed to us that the Government of India are more likely to contemplate taking their stand on 71. The powers given under 27 could be used m the present case only in respect of import, and so would probably not be applicable in a number of cases winch may arise under in the second paragraph of our letter we C.F.&amp;. Earner, Asn., K)RSIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1 the/Minute Paper. political Department. •s/ flagged. 4318ii L’000 2.30 -fH. Please see the Political Resident’s letter of 18th January on P. 1329 below, proposing the issue of a King’s Regulation, aider the Bahrein Order in Council of 1913, to prohibit the traffic m cultured pearls. The case for such a regulation appears to be a strong one, and it has now been accepted by the Government of India, who have forwarded a draft for approval. 2. The draft originally proposed by the Political Resident will be found on P. 1329/30. It will be seen that the Government of India have modified it by omitting any reference to penalties for breach of the regulation.- It seems probable that they are taking their stand on the powers given by Section and (3), to which reference is invited, of the Bahrein Order in Council, under which persons committing any breach of ^gulations under the Order shall, in addition to any forfeiture prescribed thereby, be liable, on conviction, to imprisonment for a period not exceeding three months, or a fine, or both. If the Political Resident thinks in practice that the penalties in question are insufficient, he can be trusted to come back with fresh proposals. J On the question of procedure, under Article x 72 of the Bahrein Order in Council, 1913, King's Regulations shall not take effect until they are allowed by a Secretary of State, or, with his previous or subsequent assent, by the Governor-General of India in Council, save in the event of urgency, in which case a special procedure is prescribed. In theory, there is no reason why the Secretary of State for India should not allow the regulation now proposed, subject to the concurrence ■concurrence of the Foreigi Office. In practice, however, the Foreiga Office prefer to allow these regulations themselves, even in cases such as that of Bahrein, in which tney are not very directly concerned. After discussion with the Eastern Department and with Hiss Bigby, who is the Foreiga Office expert on King’s Regulations procedure, I suggest that we should ask the Foreiga Office to allow the regulation, if they concur in it, but that the necessary instructions should be despatched to the Political Resident direct from this Office, as proposed by the Government of India. A A draft is submitted. In the event of the Order being approved by the Foreiga Office, I submit that the Department may inform the Political Resident without further submission. ^ T.eaal Adviser. ^or information, and favour of any observation^.

Colonel Prideaux then expressed the view that the pearl merchants of Bahrein, believing that no really large pearls could be produced by artificial means, were not at that time disturbed at the possibility of cultured pearls being occasiorahty foisted on them. The situation, however, has now completely changed. It is realised that many cultured pearls are of considerable size and there is much apprehension among pearl dealers in Bahrein regarding the possibility of their importa tion, and that their fears are not groundless is shown by the fact that one of the Ruling family v/as recently proved to have sent two Japanese pearls out to the Banks for sale. These apprehensions are not confined to Bahrein and the Shaikh of Kuwait also referred to the matter in a conversation with me. The Political Agent has now informed me that the Bahrein Government intend to frame legislation prohibiting the traffic in cultured pearls, and Captain Prior, therefore, suggests that a King’s Regulation prohibiting the traffic should be issued simultaneously to cover the case of that large section of the Bahrein population over whom the Bahrein Government have no jurisdiction. 1, therefore, forward, herewith, a draft King! s Regulation issued under Section 70(a) of the Bahrein Order in Council, of 1913, for the approval of the Governor-General in Council. 3. It will be seen that Article I not only prohibits dealings £1“in cultured pearls but also in tinted pearls. I understand XX that tinting is a punishable offence in France and is, of course, a form of fraud. Bleaching, on the other hand, is a recognised process which almost all pearls undergo and is not a form of fraud. On the other hand, if a pearl is X&amp;Sbleajfhed a second time it may be seriously harmed and with a view to preventing the sale of pearls as unbleached which have already been bleached, the Bahrein Government propose to compel dealers to have them drilled first if they wish to reimport them into Bahrein. This will prevent the sale in Bahrein of bleached pearls as unbleached. I have, therefore, inserted an Article, No.4 in the draft King’s Regulation, prohibiting the sale of bleacned and drilled pearls. The maximum punish ment proposed is similar to that prescribed in Section 27, x tint Ixl of the Bahrein Order in Council for importing prohibi ted goods. I would request that sanction be accorded to the draft Regulation before the beginning of the next pearling season, i.e., by April next.

The Customs Department, under hF.de Grenier, are on the qui vive . They recently arrested a man for selling a pearl for Rs. 80/- which was ordinarily considered to be worth Rs.500/-. Tke pearl was shown to a number of experts including one or two notable Frenchmen. It was pronounced by them all to be genuine, I am informed that it is impossible probably to recognise these artificial pearls except by X-raying. Pearl-traders in Bahrain are not much disturbed at the possibility of artificial pearls being occasionally foisted on them, as they believe that no really large pearls have yet been produced by the Japanese method. Copies of this despatch are being* sent to H®M f s Legation, Tehran, and the Department of Overseas Trade, London. 1£8&gt; (S&gt; From - The Residency Agent, Shargah. To - The Hon’hle the Political Resident, Persian Gulf. No.300, dated 15th July 1924. A.O. I have the honour to forward herewith letter in original received from Shaikh Saeed bin Maktoom, Shaikh of Debai, stating that he has received letters from Bombay that people (at Debai) have taken there artificial pearls to the value of two laks of Rupees for the purpose of mixing same with natural pearls for sale. The Shaikh further says that he has summoned Arab, Persian and Hindu traders in pearls and has warned them (of bad consequences) if they were to mix artificial pearls with natural ones for sale and also that he has circulated a notice for the information of the general public, in this respect. Gf this notice a copy is enclosed for your information. I further beg to state that the Shaikh f s meaning- as convey ed in his letter to me is that it is probable that there may exist artificial pearls with Hindus and Hyderabadis (British subjects) and Persian merchants who communicate with Bombay and he cannot punish them without my information. For this reason I wrote a letter to the Hindus (vide my letter No•297, dated 22nd July 1924, of which a copy is enclosed for your information) warning them against their mixing' artificial pearls with natur/al ones in their dealings with Arabs. I take the liberty to ask for permission for confiscation of artificial pearls, if found with Hindus and foreigners, to put a stop to its trade and to report to you in due course. Nowadays divers* boats are about to enter Debai for sale of pearls and purchase of stores and then to return for diving. It is possible that they may include artificial pearls in natural ones.Letter from Shaikh Saeed bin Maktoom to the Residency Agent, Shargah. Dated yth Lilhejjeh 1342 (12-7-24). A.O. I beg to inform you that I have received letters from Bombay that people here have brought artificial pearls to the value of about two laics for mixing with natural ones for sale. I have therefore summoned merchants of this class consisting of Arabs and Hindus and have warned them in this respect and have circulated a notice in regard to this matter of which a copy is sent herewith for your information. I request you for assistance in this connection and to warn them. I trust you will not fail to do so and it is need less to write you mors than this. Translation of the notice referred to above. I hereby notify all interested in the sale and purchase of pearls whether they be Arabs or Persians, Hindus or Bunnias or people of Surat, that it has become certain and positive to me that artificial pearls exist in this place and thereabouts and I have fcaen the same with certain individuals. I therefore warn all mentioned herein not to transact or deal in (such pearls) or to mingle same (with natural ones). Should such artificial pearls be found with any one or be seen among pearls he has sold he shall be punished with fine and banished from this country and confiscation of his property. Fore warned is fore armed. Circular circulated by the Residency Agent, Shargah, No.2^7 dated 22nd July 1^24. I hereby notify for information that I have received a letter from Shaikh Saeed bin i.iaktoom to the effect that he has received several letters from Bombay also by Arab merchants of Jeoai who deal in pearls, that people have brought to the OmanGoast a quantity oiV'a! r ^f'a v c &gt; iaX^ ar - Ls value of 2 laks ' y for mixing same with the natural ones for sale and that the said Shaikh has summoned all Arab and Persian merchants and you as well and has warned you all not to mix same and he has moreover circulated a notice in this respect for the information of all. In my opinion the measures taken by the Shaikh to stop trade in artificial pearls is advisable because such a trade would spoil the legitimate trade in natural pearls. I think that should it come to the notice of the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf that a man uas brought artific^.1 pearls to cheat traders in pearls and to sell same at the same price as natural ones he will punish such a man if he has sold such pearls against the purport of Shaikh Gaeed bin Maktoom f s h±h notice. oince you Bunnias are British subjects it is necessary to inform you in this matter, so that you should act with due knowledge and not fall into difficulties and disputes with Arabs in regard to pearls.
