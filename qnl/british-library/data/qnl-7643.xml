HE present volume of Biographical Notices is intended for the use of His Majesty’s Government Service, and is of a strictly confidential character. The volume compiled by me in August 1909 has been brought up to date, corrected and enlarged, with the help of His Majesty’s Consular Officers in Persia who have supplied new data for the work. The names of all important members of the Persian Government, the principal members of the Clergy, and the notabilities of all classes, as well as a number of minor officials and persons of lesser degree, have been included, with a short notice of their pedigrees and careers, as far as I have been able to collect them. The female element of the Persian society dealt with has, as a general rule, been excluded, though some Princesses of the Boyal House are noted and referred to. The glossary includes a list of the various titles included in the notices, in their original Persian characters, for reference in case of need. G. P. CHURCHILL.

HazArah Tribe of KhtjrAsAn— After the last siege of Herat the Persian Commander, Hisam-us-Saltanah, Governor-General of Khurasan, brought about 5,000 families of this tribe from Kala Nau, in the Herat district, to Khurasan. They were allotted lands in the Jam and Bakharz districts, and their chief, Yusuf Khan, was given the rank and pay of a Sartlp, with a service of Hazarah Sowars. After a short time about 2,000 families returned to Kala Nau, and the Persian Government did not consider it advisable to leave the remaining families on the frontier. They, therefore, moved them to Isfarain, where they remained some years. Prom Isfarain they were moved to Kanah Gushah, a village near Meshed. In 1877 Yusuf Khan was appointed Governor of Bakharz, where he built the village of Muhsinabad. on the Herat frontier, and settled a number of the families there. His son, Ismail Khan, remained with a number of the families at Kanah Gushah. Yusuf Khan died in 1885, and was succeeded by his son, Isma il Khan, Shuja’-ul-Mulk {q v.). The Hazarahs in Khura san now number about 1,200 families, who live in Kanah Gushah, Kanahist, Kalta Chanar, and Muhsinabad, in the Meshed and Bakharz districts.

HisAm-ud-Daulah. (Mir AH Akbar Khan.) Known as Hashmat-ul-Mulk until 1908, when he received his present title. Belongs to an old family of Arabs. The present generation is the eighth in descent from the founder of the family, Mir AH Khan, of the Arab tribe of Khuzaima, which is said to have been forced to emigrate from Arabia to Khurasan in the time of Khalifa Harun- ur-Bashid, in the beginning of the ninth century, and was settled in the Qain district as a check on the turbulent natives of that district. The tribe remained wealthy flock-owners, and gradually increased in power till Mir AH Khan, their Chief, became Amir of Qain about the seventeenth century. His son, Mir Ma’sum Khan, is said to have been in Nadir Sh&amp;h’s service, and his grandson, Mir ’AlainKhan, is said to have been the man who deprived Shah Kukh, grandson of Nadir Shah, of his eyesight at Meshed in 1748- la the disturbances that subsequently ensued, Mir Alam Khan gained power and proclaimed himself Amir of Khurasan, but was forced to leave the country by Ahmad Shah Abdali. It is said that he was succeeded as Amir of Qain by Mir Isma’ll Khan and the latter by Mir ’Alam Khan II, the grandfather of Mir Alam Khan III, Hashmat-ul-Mulk, father of the present Chief of Qain, and of the present Chief of Slstan and Tabas who died in Meshed in 1891. On his death the title of Hashmat ul-Mulk was given to his elder son Mir All Akbar Khan; and a new title, Shaukat-ul-Mulk, was conferred on his second son, Mir Isma’ll Khan, who like his brother Muhammad Ibrahim Khan, is by a different mother. In 1891 the Governorship of Slstan was given to the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, and Qain to his half brother Shaukat-ul*Mulk. A family feud has existed ever since between them, connected probably with the parti tion of their father’s estate. The Hashmat-ul-Mulk acquired the reputation of being an Anglophile and to the Shaukat-ul-Mulk a leaning to Russian interests was attributed. These reports, however, arose primarily from their enmities to one another. The dispute over water rights which arose between the Afghans and Persians on the Slstan border, and Colonel MacMahon’s Commission to adjust the difference, brought matters to a head in 1902-03 when the political antagonists of both the Hashmat and Shaukat, working upon the suspicions existing in the Court at Tehran as to their loyalty, brought about their summons to Tehran. Both did their best to evade the Shah’s orders and the Shaukat-ul-Mulk died in 1905 still evading the summons; hut the Hashmat arrived at Tehran in July 1904, leaving his son Mir Ma’siim Khan as Deputy Governor of Slstan. After protracted negotiations Muhammad Ibrahim Khan obtained his brother’s title of Shaukat-ul-Mulk and the Governorship of Qain in May 1905, which the Hashmat-ul- Mulk had endeavoured in vain to obtain. Resided at Tehran from 1904 to 1908 and tried very hard to obtain the Governorship of Qain from his younger brother which His Majesty’s Legation opposed unsuccessfully. He obtained the post in October 1908 by heavily bribing the Grand Vizier and others; hut was dismissed by the Nationalist government in August 1909. Has two sons: 1.

Zaman Khan’s cousins, Mir Ahmad Khan, Abdulla Khan, and Mahdi Quli Khan (sons of Jabbar Khan, son of Mahmdd Khan), who were also Jamshidi Khans, were inimical to him. From Badghis the tribe migrated to Marv and afterwards to 'Organj; about 2,000 families, however, remained and settled at Kurrukh, and Khan Hazrat, the Amir of Urganj, appointed Mir Ahmad Khan as chief of the tribe settled in that district. ’Abdullah Khan was appointed chief of the Jamshidis in Herat, but he fled to Maimanah, where upon Allahyar Khan, son of Zaman Khan, took his position. About this time disputes arose between the U rganj and Yamiit tribes, and during these disputes Mir Ahmad Khan was killed. The Khan of Urganj then appointed Mahdi Quli Khan, chief of the Jamshidis, and conferred upon him the title of Khan Aqa. During the disturbances in Urganj, Mahdi Khan, who was anxious to return to his former residence, escaped and went to Andkhui. Herat was, at this time, being besieged by the Persians under Hisam-us- Saltanah, Sultan Murad Mirza, who, acting under the orders of his Government, persuaded 2,000 families of Jamshidis to migrate to Khurasan under their chief Allahyar Khan, and settled them in the Sar-i-Jam district. After Hisam-us-Saltanah’s return from Herat, the Jamshidi families in Andkhui came back to B erat and settled in Badghis, under their chief Mahdi Quli Khan, Khan Aqa, who was afterwards murdered by Sardar Ayub Khan at Herat. His son Yalangtiish Khan, who succeeded him, was killed by Amir Abdur Rahman Khan. The Jamshidis who had migrated to Khurasan remained in Sar-i-Jam for six months, but, as the Turkomans frequently raided that district, they migrated to Kanah Giishah and Qarabuq’ah, near Meshed, whence a large number of the families were sent back to Her&amp;t by their chief: and on this becoming known to the Persian39 authorities, Allahy&amp;r Khan, the chief, fled to Herat. On his flight, the remaining families were placed under the Kaoti chief Isma’il Khan. The Jamshidis were then moved to Qushkhanah, in the Quchan district, where they remained for a few years with the Kaoti families. Afterwards they were brought back to Kanah Gusl ah and Qarabuq’ah. In the meantime Allahyar Khan, being displeased with the treatment he received at Herat from Sardar Ya^kuh Khan, fled to Meshed, and became chief of the Jamshidis in Khurasan. They then numbered about 300 families, hut this number was subse- r quently reduced to 150 by a famine which occurred in Khurasan. Allahyar Khan died at Qarabuq’ah and was succeeded as chief by his son Yidjiqdr Khan. In 1885, half of the Jamshidis were sent to Paskamar, and the rest joined them three years afterwards. At this time they only numbered about 80 families, which is their present strength. In 1889 Zulfiqar Khan opened negotiations with the Russians, where upon he and the tribe were sent back to Qarabuq’ah. He then fled to Russian territory, and his younger brother JlwMmwiacZ A’zam Khdn was made chief. The tribe is now settled in Jalalabad and Raza Abad, near Shahan-i-Garmab, about ten farsakhs from Meshed. Zulfiqar Khan returned to Meshed, and settled at Shurjah, near Paskamar, where he lives at present. About 50 families of Jam- ** shidis fled from Herat to Khurasan in 1893, and are at present in the Zurabad district under Sa’id Ahmad Beg. The Jamshidis have a service of 50 sowars. In 1906, all the Jamshidis, with very few exceptions, fled to Herat. They have been given land on the Persian frontier near Kuhsan. Of their former chiefs, Muhammad Azlm Kban is dead andZu.fiqar Kban is in Kandahar, the present chief is Qillch Khan who has a service of 50 sowars in Afghanistan. The remaining Jamshidis in Khurasan are under Isma’il Khan Sistdni, whose head-quarters are at Sarakhs. 186.

Eldest son of Muzaffar-ud-Dm Shah. Succeeded to the throne January 8 th, 1907, crowned on the 19th of the same month and deposed 16th July 1909. It is needless to recapitulate the circumstances in which Muhammad All found the country when he succeeded to the throne. Parliamentary institutions had become a fait accompli only a few weeks before, and the question was how would he deal with the situation ? He had been brought up at Tabriz, under the Russian tutelage. He had governed the province of Azarbaijan shamefully, was addicted to successive greed and duplicity and among other vices was a drunkard. The recent events in Persia have answered the question. He endeavoured by all means in his power, not even shrinking from the most repelling atrocities, to extinguish the popular movement for liberty. He began by employing courtiers of the type of Qaim Maqam and ’Ala-ud-Daulah for his reactionary purposes. He then turned to such types as Sa’d-ud-Haulah and Amir Bahadur and finally descended to giving direct orders to the roughs of the city. The murder of Amln-us-Sultan in August 1907 was attributed to his instigation, and he was only prevented from using violence upon his Prime Minister Nasir-ul-Mulk by the intervention of His Maiesty’s Legation in December of the same year. He 107 elaborate additional articles to the constitution on October 8 th, 1J07, and took the oath of allegiance to the National Assembly at his State visit on November 12th of the same year and a month later attempted the coup d'etat (December 15-20) which failed only to be followed by that of June 1908.

Left Tehran for Russia September 9th, 1909, the new Government having agreed to give him a yearly pension of £ 20 , 000 , and after he had transferred all his personal estates to the Government which also took over his personal debts to the Russian and Imperial Banks, the former amounting to some £300,000. 251.

He studied for fourteen years as a youth in Najaf and returned to Shushtar, where he was regarded with respect, increased by tne fact that he took no part in local politics. This state of affairs was subsequently altered by his son, Saiyid Ja’far, who set himself to assiduously cultivating the f avour of the local Governors. In league with the Sardar fVEukarram he finally brought about destruction on the well known family of the Kalantars. This involved a breach with the other great religious house, that of Shaikh Muhammad’All, and enmity against them was pursued with great animosity resulting in the flight of Shaikh Murtaza, son of the now deceased Shaikh Muhammad ’All. On the Sardar Mukarram’s deposition in 1907, th® people of Shushtar rose aginst the Saiyids, whom with all justification they regarded as tyrants, and drove them out; at the same time Shaikh Murtaza returned and was received with open arms.

On the departure of the Sardar-i- Mukarram in 1907 and the expulsion of the Saiyids, he returned to Shushtar where he was for the moment the popular hero. He seems to have acted with moderation, but the disturbances which followed in Shushtar were attributed to him by Shaikh Khazal who accordingly conceived a hostility against him. The fickle affections of the Shushtans were soon alienated from him and he lost all influence. In the end of 1907 he leased a piece of land, of which he claims the ownership, at Shalaili to Messrs. Lvnch Brothers to build a store on. His right was disputed by the Mu’ in -ut-Tui i ar who. had Haji Hals’s support. Work was interrupted and has not yet been resumed. In November 1908 Shaikli Murtaza proceeded on the Haj, from which he returned in March 1909. He is intelligent, open-minded, and friendly to Europeans ; but has no great force of character.

Acred 55 years approximately. His father was a leading Mujtahid of ° Ahram. He was sent to Karbala to study law and after completing his studies he went to Shiraz and was teaching in one of the old-fashioned schools there. On receiving testimonials from the High Priests of Karbala he came to Bushire about six years ago and set up as a Mujtahid. Owing to his audacity and daring he is held in respect by a number of people who receive protection from him when they are molested by local Government officials. He is a turbulent individual much given to getting up disturb ances. 311. N Air-ttt-Tauliah (HAjf Saiyid Husain.) Ao'e about 50 years in 1909. His mother was a Princess. He was key- bearer of the Shrine at Karbala ; but having quarrelled with the Ottoman Government, he emigrated to Meshed. Is very friendly to Europeans but has no great following. 315. NajaeI, AqA, (Mujtahid of Ispahan). This Mujtahid is the terror of the “ Bihai ” sect and has more than once caused many of their numbers to be put to death by fanning the fanaticism of the “ Shf’ahs ” against them. The brutal and inhuman outbreak in Yezd and Ispahan during the summer of 1903 wasCaused by Aqa Najafi and his followers. He was summoned to Tehran in 1904, and shortly afterwards was allowed to return to Ispahan. These proceedings very much resembled those of 1890, as described in the Biographical Notes published in 1898, which are quoted below. (Biographical notices, 1898). A qd Najafi continued his fanatical activity in Ispahan after his return there in 1904, and will probably always give trouble to the Government, and be a source of perpetual menace to the peaceful population of Ispahan. Has received a present from his Majesty’s Legation in return for an undertaking to abstain from preaching against English Missionary work at Ispahan, of which he has always shown himself a violent enemy. Erom 1905 to 1908 Aqa Najafi did not take a very prominent part in Ispahan affairs; but his brother Shaikh Nurullah gave much trouble. He brought about the dismissal of the Zill-us-Sultan from the Governorship of Isfah&amp;n in February 1907 and having again made friends with the Zill-us-Sultan intrigued with him in 1908, but made no effort to support the cause of the popular party which he pretended to espouse when the ex-Shah effected the coup d'etat in Tehran on June 23rd, 1908. Aqa Najafi, Shaikh Muhammad, All; Shaikh Nurulla, his brother. These three brothers are Mujtahids of Ispahan, and sons of the late Haji Shaikh Muhammad Baqir, who was a very influential man. The first mamed has great influence and many followers. He interferes in almost every public affair and in many private ones. After the Zill-us-Sultan he is probably the richest man in Ispahan. He is the great enemy of the Babis, and has caused many of them to be killed. In 1889-90, he had a number of Shaikhls killed, although they were under the protection of Government troops. For this, at the instance of Her Britannic Majesty’s Minister, he was brought to Tehran, but was treated with so much honour, that when he returned to Ispahan his fame and power were largely increased. He and his brothers have more than once interfered w r ith British merchants, to the latter’s detriment. They also twice caused European goods to be boycotted in the bazars of Ispahan. They are fair representatives of the fanatical party of Persia. They have given much trouble to the British Legation at Tehran owing to their persecutions of the Jews. 316. RaihIntjllah, AqI, Saiyid, (Mujtahid, Burujirdf—born about 1825). Is the leader of the anti-Jewish party. Persecuted the Jews in Hamadan, 1896, and led that movement against them in Tehran in 1897.

The Qarais are Turks, and a large number of their families were removed from Turkistan to Syria by one of the Mongol kings, whence they were brought to Bars by Amir Timur, and eventually from Bars to Khurasan by Shah Isma’il Safavi. They remained in the Merv and Herat districts for some time, but afterwards settled in the Turbat-i-Haidari district, which was in an almost independent state in the early part of the nineteenth century. At that time they were a very powerful tribe, but gradually their number declined. This decline was the result of rebellion, continued persecution from the Turkomans, and famine. Is haq Khan Qarai, who wa* then chief, gained great power and was in open rebellion during the reign of Bath ’AH Shah. In 1815, he and his son Hasan AH Khan were killed at Meshed by Muhammad Vali Mirza. The second son, Muhammad Khan Qarai, then rebelled, but was coerced by Hasan AH Mirza, Shuja’-us-Saltanah, in 1819. In 1829 he again rebelled and took possession of Meshed; he was subdued, however, by the troops of Ahmad ’AH Mirza, son of Bath AH Shah and Governor-General of Khurasan. He then remained in a semi-independent state, and never properly acknowledged the authority of the Qajars. After his death the chiefs of the Qarai tribe lost their former independence, and gradually the hereditary chiefship was abolished and the tribe was put under the Governor of the Turbat-i-Haidari district. Their leading Khans are AM Naqi Khan, Shaji-ul-Mulk, a descendant of Ishaq Khan. 443. QarishmAr tribe of KhurAsan. The tribe is also caUed Bayuj and Gharibzadah; but is generally known as Qarishmar in Khurasan. The name is a corruption of “ ghair- i-shwmar' (out of the count). They are gipsies ; and it is said that about 12,000 families of them were brought to Persia from India by Bahram-i-Gur, to act as singers and dancers. They are scattered all over Khurasan, and number several thousand families. The whole of this tribe is under the Shah’s Shatirbashi, who collects their taxes and governs them through his deputies in each province. The chief in Khurasan is 'All Akbar Khan Sartip, son of Hajl Hashim Khan, now dead, a relative of the Shatribashi who Hves at Meshed. 444. QashqAi tribe (Qashqai chiefs of Bars). The Qashqais have sprung from the great Turkish Khalaj tribe which settled in Asia Minor during the middle ages. At the end of the fourteenth century, when Timur removed the Khalaj from Asia Minor to Central and Eastern Persia, a great number of them ran away and settled in Bars, and from this “ running away ” (in Turkish Qashmaq) the part of the Khalaj which settled in Edrs was caUed Qashqai, i.e., fugitives. They now number about 25,000 families, sub-divided into 66 Hr ah (branches), each with a kaldntar or kadkhudd. The chief of the tribe is the Ilkhanl, and his deputy is the Ilbegl; the former generally resides in Shiraz as hostage for* the good behaviour of the tribe, while the latter is with the tribe. The last Ilkhani was Darab Khan (born 1829), son of Mustafd QuH Khan, Sardar, of the Shahillu branch.

After the death of Isma’il Khan, his son Jani Khan became Ilbegi, and in 1819 was made Ilkhani. He died in 1824 and was succeeded as llkhani by his second son, Muhammad ’All Khan (horn 1793), who died in 1851. Muhammad ’All Khan had married a daughter of Farman Farma Husain ’All Mirza in 1826, and left three sons by other wives, viz. (a) Jahangir Khan (born 1815), Ilbegi, who married a sister of Muhammad Shah and was commander (Sartip) of the Qashqai Infantry Regiment until 1849, when he was appointed Governor of Harab. In 1851, on his father’s death, he became Ilbegi and was appointed Governor of Kazirun. He died in 1871. His son Muhammad Hasan Khan was Sarhang of the Qashqai Infantry, and some time Governor of Abadih, and lately Governor, of Bunat. His second son was Lutf ’Ali Khan, who was Sartip of the Qashqai Regiment from 1851 until his death in 1856, and left a son —Hdji Muhammad Sddiq Khdn. His third son, Haji Nasrullah Khan (horn 1840), was Sartip of Qashqai Regiment from 1856 to 1878, when he became Ilbegi and Governor of Kamfiruz and Chahar-dangah. He died some years ago and left a son, Sultan Ibrahim Khdn Sarhang, Asad-us-Saltanah (born 1870), who was Ilkhani for a few months in 1907. He visited Paris in 1908 and is now (1909) Ilbegi. His sister is the wife of Qav&amp;m- ul-Mulk and the mother of Intizam-ul-Mamalik. The eldest son of Jani Khan Ilkhani was Haji Husain Quli Khan, who being of a quiet disposition, was thought to be incapable of succeed ing his father as Ilkhani and settled in Kamfiruz where three of his grandsons—’Abbas Khan, ’Ali Akbar Khan, and Baqir Khan—are now living. The third son of Jani Khan, Ilkhani, was Murtaza Quli Khan, Ilbegi; he died in 1833 of a wound which he received in an engagement with Government troops sent out to seize him. He left two sons,’Ali Quli Khan and Qahad Khan. ’Ali Quli Khfin was born in 1815, appointed Ilbegi in 1871, and died not long ago. He left four sons: Allah Quli Khdn, Kuhandil Khdn, Amdnullah Khdn, and Habibullah Khdn, who are now living. Qabad Khan died some years ago. He left one son, Imam Quli Khdn. The fourth son of Jani Khan Ilhegi was Mustafa Quli Khan, Sardar, nho was killed at the siege of Kirman in 1831.

In 1901 he returned to Persia and obtained the post of Director of Imperial Customs at Shushtar which he held till 1907. He gained a position of considerable influence with the townspeople which he latterly sacrificed by devoting himself to the interests of the Governor, the Sardar-i-Mukarram, whose tool he was. Accused of being engaged in various nefarious practices. On the Sardar-i-Mukarram’s departure his position became unten able and in the end of 1907 he obtained a transfer to Ahwaz, where he has since remained in charge of the Customs.

Kesiding to the south and south west of Dizful. Head-quarters usually in Husainabad tract in neighbourhood of Shush.102 There has been a long-continued antagonism between Shaikh Haidar and Shaikh Farhan Asad, which reached a climax in 1904, when Haidar was defeated and plundered by the latter. On this occasion the Sagvand completed the work commenced by Farhan, but Haidar has marriage relations with the Sagvand, and as a rule can count on them for some amount of assistance. After a chequered period of misfortune, during which he had to reckon among his enemies the Sardar-i- Mukarram and Shaikh Khazal, he re-established his fortunes in 1908. In that year with the aid of the Sagvand, and the moral support of the Shaikh of Muhammarah, he thoroughly defeated Farhan, and regained the support of his own tribe, who had largely desired his cause. Shaikh Haidar bears a good reputation among ’Arabs for his personal qualities. He is lacking, however, in force of character, energy and initiative. He has 8 sons. The eldest, Shaikh Hasan, is of no practical merit. The next, ’Abbas, is a friend of the Ahwaz Consulate, and has on occasions given practical proof of his friendliness. 525.

His powers are, however, strictly circumscribed by the distrust of Shaikh Khazal without whose orders he can take no step of any significance. He is the only surviving relation of Shaikh Khazal, always excepting sons, who is of sufficient position or ability to be possibly regarded as a poten tial rival. He is pleasant mannered and on the wffiole has acted well by all Britishers, but his free will and actions are sometimes affected by tools of Haji Hals and his uncle, such as Haji Saiyid Husain, whom he has to pay regard to as spies ready to misrepresent his least action to Skaikh Khazal. He has one son Shaikh Sultan, a boy of some 10 years. 526. Shaikh JIbih Khan. Son of late Shaikh ’Abdulla of Chaab, and by birth Shaikh of Chaab. Born about 1898.

The tribe remained wealthy dock-owners, and gradually increased in power till Mir ’Ali Khan, their chief, became Amir of Qain about the seventeenth century. His son, Mir Ma’sum Khan, is said to have been in Nadir Shah’s service, and his grandson, Mir ’Alam Khan, is said to have been the man who deprived Shah Rukh, grandson of Nadir Shah, of his eyesight at Meshed in 1748. In the disturbances that subsequently ensued, Mir ’Alam Khan gained power and proclaimed himself Amir of Khurasan, but was forced to leave the country by Ahmad Shah Abdali. It is said that he was succeeded as Amir of Qain by Mir Isma’il Khan, and the latter by Mir ’Alam Khan II, the grandfather of Mir ’Alam Khan III, Hashmat- ul-Mulk, father of the present Chief of Qain, and of the present Chief of Sistan and Tabas, who died in Meshed in 1891. On his death the title of Hashmat-ul-Mulk was given to his elder son, Mir ’Ali Akbar Khan, now Hisam-ud-Daulah, and a new title, Shaukat-ul-Mulk, was conferred on his second son. By this the family was sjdit up into two, and the power of the old Amir proportionately reduced. The Persian Government has now dropped the title of Amir, and designates the sons as “ Hukmrans ” (Governors) of Qain and Sistan. He had no children, and appointed his younger brother, Mir Muham mad Ibrahim Khan Sartij), his heir. On the death of the above in 1905 Mir Muhammad Ibrahim Khan received the title as well as the Governorship of Qain notwith standing every endeavour on the part of Hisam-ud-Daulah to prevent it. He was, however, turned out by his brother in October 1908 but was reappointed by the Nationalists in 1909. Is a capable man and most friendly to His Majesty’s Consuls.

Timuki Tribe of KhurAsAn— The Tlmurfs are said by some to be of Tartar origin, but this is not certain, as they have neither a tribal history nor the distinctive Tartar features. It is, however, beyond doubt that they origi nally came to these parts from Syria, and therefore they may he Arabs. About 20,000 families of these people are said to have been moved from Syria to Turkistan by Amir Timur, hence their name. Amir Timur settled them in the Balkh district, which he gave them, as a dowry to his daughter wTio was married to Mir Saiyid Kalal, a saint of Arab descent living on the banks of the Oxus, who was Amir Timur’s spiritual guide. On Mir Saiyid Kalal’s death, the tribe was distributed among his sons. One of these sons, Saiyid Mir Shahid also called (Mir SMh Khan), got about four thousand families and removed them from Balkh to the Herat district. He was very conside rate and kind to his people, and his amiable qualities attracted the majority of the families remaining in Balkh, who also joined him and settled in the Herat district. W r hen Muham mad Shah Qajar besieged Herat in 1838, he moved about eight thousand families to Khurasan under their chief, Qillch Khan, a great-grandson of Mir Saiyid Kalal, who gained great power and became the ruling chief of the districts of Jam, Bakharz, Kliaf, and Zurabad, with the title of Amir.110 670 .

(granted, September 1887 , conferred, June 1888). Born 5th January 1850. Is the eldest son of Nasir-ud-Din Shah, by ‘ Iffat-us-Saltanah, an Afshar lady. His parentage on the mother’s side (the ’Iffat-us-Saltanah not being a Royal Princess) always stood in the way of his being declared heir to the throne : this position thus fell to Muzaffar-ud-Bin who born of Royal parents on both sides, was declared Valia hd, and was accepted by the people as possessing all the necessary quail- fications.116 He received the title of Yamln-ud-Daulah in 1830, and his present title in 1869.

At one period during the lifetime of Nasir-ud-Din Shah he held the ioint Governorships of Ispahan, Pars, ’Irak, Yazd, and ’Arahistan and maintained a force of some 15,000 well-trained and disciplined soldiers. This force was disbanded in 1888 by order of Nasir-ud-Din Shah, who had become jealous of the reputation and the position occupied by his son. See Sir A. Nicolson’s despatch No. 27 (Secret) of February 28th 1888. The Zill-us-Sultan was then gradually reduced to the position of an ordinary subject, and at the death of Nasir-ud-Din Shah in May 189 3, was Governor of the province of Ispahan only. His power was still further curtailed on the accession of Muzaffar- ud-Din Sh£h. He behaved very well on the death of his father, and maintained good order in his province, and at once expressed his allegiance to his younger brother. He is very rich, owning villages and property in Persia, worth, it is said, about £250,000, and has investments in 1 per cent.

Eesided in Tehran for the rest of the year. In December when the Shah incurred great unpopularity by his attempted coup d'etat the Zill-us-Sultan was openly spoken of as a candidate for the throne, and it seemed that at one moment he was indeed endeavouring to seize the throne. Received orders from the Cabinet to quit Tehran and appealed to the British Legation to protect him under the terms of officially written promise of protection given to him by successive British Ministers. Appointed Governor of Pars, March 1908, which post he held until July of that year when he was dismissed after his house in Tehran had been sacked during the coup d'etat of June 23. Left for Europe via Tehran in August having received letters of guarantee from the British and Russian Legations for the safety of his property during his absence. Returned to Persia in August 1909 when he was prevented by the Nationalists from proceeding to Tehran. The Zill is a man of firm character and is a good Provincial Governor. He no doubt thought that the Nationalist move ment which brought about the dethronement of Muhammad ’Ali Shah in July 1909 would put him on the throne.
