The decision of this Council will bind those accepting them except in the case of a difference between two States of the League which they have referred to the Council for settlement. In this case the decisions of the Council will have to be carried out (sic). In all cases it is forbidden to have recourse to force to settle conflicts between two States of the League, Each State, will have the right to conclude with another State, whether or not a member of the League, particular agreement.a which are not contrary to the text and spirit of these dispositions, -In no case will a State be allowed to follow a foreign policy prejudicial to the policy of the League or to any one of the member States. The Council will mediate in every difference susceptible of provoking war between a member Stc.-te and another member or non-member with a view to reconciling them. A commission will be formed of the members of the preparatory committee in order to elaborate the statutes of the Council and to examine political questions which could be the object of agreements to be concluded'between Arab countries• Part E. The *rab States represented on the Committee will co-operate in economics cultural and social questions such as commercial exchanges customs currency agriculture industry communications cultural questions nationality passports social and sanitary questions etc, / Commission of experts in each category of these questions will be formed of representatives of the Governments which have participated in the Preparatory CoMmittee in order to elaborate projects determining the means of co-operation.n ■ • Xn biit-’S6 mctot*6P3 a. coniiuission oi co-ordination will be formed to control the workings of these various CoM/iissions and to put their rosolutions in the form of draft agreements for submission to the different Governments.

Part 5. (a) The Oom-ittee considers that Palestine constitutes one of the important elements of grab countries and that the rights of the Palestine grabs cannot be affected without danger to the peace and stablity of the Arab world. The Committee considers that the engagements taken by Great Britain which involve the stopgap e of Jewish imiaigr; tion, the safeguarding of lands belonging to the Arabs and the progress (acheminement) of Palestine to ards independence constitute acquired rights for the Arabs and that their execution will be a forward steo towards one goax, tovvaros the strengthening of peace and stability. The Committee proclaims its support of the Palestine cause for the realisation of its legitimate aspirations and for the saf©guarding of its just rights* The Committee declares that as much as .■ uiya*iC j-t has compe.s^ion for the 'sufferings which Jews have endure-; in fur ope oy the action of some dietat rial ftatis hut the case of these Jews must not be confounded with Zionism for nothing would be more unjust than to wish to settle the . uo.,f ic;, of I uropean Jews by another injustice of which would be the Palestinian Arabs to whatever religion or confession they belong.

At the termination of the last Great war, the xrab countries were detached from the Ottoman empire. These included Palestine, a vilayet of that Cmpire, which became autonomous, depending on no other Power. The Treaty of Lausanne proclaimed that the question of alestine was the concern of the interested parties and, although she was not in a position to direct her own affairs, the Covenant of the league of Hations of 1919 settled her regime' on the basis of the acknowledgment of her independence. Her international existence and independence are therefore a matter of no doubt from the legal point of view, just as there is no doubt*fthe independence of the other Araib Countries, although the external aspects of that independence are not apparent owing to force of coreurnstances, this should not stand in the way of her participation in the work of the Council of the League. The States that have signed the Covenant of the xrab i League consider therefore that, owing to the peculiar circumstances of Palestine and until that country enjoys effective independence, the Council of the League should undertake the selection of an xrab delegate from Palestine to participate in its work. II - Special Annex relating to Co-operation with Arab Countries not participating in the Council of the League. Considering that the States participating in the League will have to deal, both in the Council and in the commissions, with questions benefiting and affecting the whole Arab world, and in view of the aspirations of the A rabcountries that are not members of the Council, it being for (^) the Council .to take them into account and work for their achievement, the dtales that have signed the covenant of the ^_rab league invite the Council of the league, when considering the participation of those countries in the commissions referred to in this covenant, to act in co-operation v.i th those countries to the greatest possible extent, aleo to spare no effort to ce acquainted with their requirements, to understand their aspirations and hopes and in addition to work for their 'welfare and for, the assuring of their future oy all means which political methods provide* III - Special annex on the appointment of the Secretary-General of- the league. The signatory states of this Covenant have agreed on the appointment of ,Jjdel Rahman Bey as Secretary-General o f Ar ab S t sees. His appointment will be for 'two years and the Council of the league will refine subsequently the future organisation of the i-^pretariat-General• IT 746-S lersian Gulf residency Bushire. the 6th July, 1945.

To make the significance of this event clear it is necessary to explain its antecedents, both recent and remote, since many people in England still find it difficult to understand the meanings of such concepts as lf the Arab world” and n Arab unity” • Originally, the word ”Arab” meant the nomads of the desert, the Arab tribes that lived in the Arabian peninsula itself. But, following the amazing fortunes of^the desert warriors when they burst out of their home in the seventh century and founded a world-empire, the word lias acquirod a new and much wider meaning. In a large part of the Byzantine world the Arab conquerors settled down, intei— married with the local population, converted the majority to Islam and gave their language to the whole people. In this way all that part of the world which lies along the southern and eastern coasts of the Mediterranean, from the Straits of Gibraltar to the Persian Gulf, became arabised, and remained so even after the Arab Empire passed away. This is the Arab world to-day. It includes Morocco, Tunis, Algiers, Libya, Egypt, Transjordan, Palestine, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq as well as the Arabian peninsula itself. It includes sophisticated city dwellers, among them an educated class speaking English and French and in close contact with European thought, as well as picturesque nomads, and comprises Christians as well as Moslems. It has its roots in a great civilisation (a combined product of Arab and^yzantine factors) which^ flourished in Damascus and Baghdad and Cairo, a civilisation which led the world for three centuries and transmitted to Europe, through the Arab universities in Spain, the thought of Greece five hundred years before the Renaissance- 4JThe Arab League - 2 The Arab Empire was disrupted by internal divisions, and its fragments fell a prey to foreign conquerors. First came the Mongol invasions, then the conquest and occupation of the whole Arab world by the Ottoman Turks for a period of four centuries from the sixteenth to the twentieth. Under a harsh and destructive rule the Arabs slumbered in an intellectual night. But even in their slumber and subjection they never lost their essential oneness. They remained a community, speaking one language, descended ~ partly at least - from the same ancestors and living a traditional life inherited from a common civilis ation. This long night came to an end in the nineteenth century when, under the impact of European and American influences (Napoleon’s expedition to Egypt, the arrival of missionaries with printing presses, the starting of schools), the Arab mind began to stir. A cultural renascence quickly followed, which spread throughout the Arab world and soon began to express itself in political nationalism. The aims of this nationalism were two: independence and unity. The reawakened Arab mind, deriving its inspiration partly from European thought and partly from the rediscovered glories of the Arabic language, wished to recreate the Arab world as a whole and give it the structure of a modern state. When the last war broke out in 1914 the Arab national movement, which had been developing for some time, saw in it the chance of liberation from Turkey. Britain, for her part, was anxious to secure the help of the Arabs against Turkey, and so a bargain was struck. In return for their participation in the war the Arabs were promised recognition of an independent Arab kingdom in Asia (the core of the Arab world) at the end of it. For reasons which are only too well known now (namely Britain’s subsequent commitments to the French and the Zionists) the 1919 peace settlement did not satisfy the Arab aspirations to either unity o£ independence. The Arab world north of the Kedjaz (the only Arab country to come out of the war as an independent state) was divided into British and French spheres of influence, and subdivided, in each sphere, into a number of separate states. Syria alone - that is to say that part of the Arab world which had always till then been known as Syria - was^broken up into three separate and artificial units, Syria, Palestine and Transjordan. As far as their national cohesion was concerned, the Arabs had been far better off under Ottoman rule, which, with all its faults, had preserved the political unity of the Arab world under one sovereign and one administration. In this new situation, each of the Arab countries concerned became for a time completely preoccupied with its own relationship with the mandatory power and the local problems that ar&amp;ae it. Independence became the immediate goal for each of them separately. But all the time the ideal of Arab unity, as the ultimate goal to be reached after independence, remained alive, and through the period between the two v/ars all the Arab countries felt as one and, whenever they could, acted as one on all major issues and at every crisis in their /separate NEWS DIVISION BRITISH MINISTRY OF INFORMATION M.E. SERVICES 6 SHARIA ANTIKHANA CAIROTiiG Arub league - 3 separate lives. The wireless, air travel and the enormous growth of the Arabic press .in recent years gave them a central nervous system which'they had not possessed before, and so quickened and enlarged their corporate consciences. With the exception of Palestine, one after another the Arab countries in this eastern part of the Arab world achieved their independence - Iraq in 1930, Egypt in 1936, Syria and the Lebanon in 1941. “ The moment had therefore come to think of the next step, unity. The war had demonstrated the strategic and economic unity of the Middle East and the wisdom of treating it as a unit. At^the same time the idea that the post-war world- order might he^ based on regional groupings of nations was ^very much in the air. The Arab world was a group of nations^occupying a vital region, and possessing, in their own^heritage, all the factors that make for union. If a regional grouping was possible anywhere in the world, surely^ it was here. The British G-overnment, seeing these possibilities and^realising the strong desire of the Arabs themselves for union, gave the movement its blessings in a declaration made by Mr. Eden in 1941. It was a friendly gesture, an attempt to make amends for the past, and as such was well received in the Arab countries. Circumstances, however, had changed somewhat since the leaders of the Arab movement in the last war planned one Arab state comprising all the Arab countries in Asia. These countries had been developing as separate states for twenty years. The division imposed upon them in 1919 had resulted in the growth of vested interest and local allegiances which could not be immediately submerged in a complete union. Neither a universal unitary state nor a federation could now be achieved at one stroke. What has been achieved is a league of sovereign states, whose object, in the wording of the pact, is, 'to draw closer the relations between them, to eo-ordinate their political action with a view to a close collaboration, to safeguard their independence and f, to^deal with all general questions affecting the Arab countries and their interests — and to achieve a close co-operation in economic, cultural, juridical social and health matters'. Membership of the leaguers open to all independent Arab states. Palestine is not yet independent and could not therefore become a member like the others, but she is regarded by all oi them as an essentially Arab country and^an integral part of the core of the Arab world, and as in their view^it is through no fault of hers that she has not yet realised her independence the League adopted a special procedure with regard to Palestine, 'it decided to associate her with it by itself nominating a Palestinian Arab to sit on its council. The Arab League is thus, in the first place, a symbol of the oneness ol the Arab world. Secondly, it is a serious^attempt to give a structure and a direction to this spirit of oneness, to provide the machinery by which /practical NEWS DIVISION BRITISH MINISTRY OF INFORMATION M.E.

Old rivalries between Arab States have become accentuated during discussions leading up to constitution of Arab League, and in these rivalries Egypt has entered as a new element. The rivalry between Egypt and Iraq for the leading role in the Arab Union became evident from the beginning of the discussions. Lfte Hashemites and Nuri so intimately associated with the Arab Movement from-its early stages, were not unnaturally piqued at being ousted by a new comer from the major role. By a natural process Ibn Saud aligned himself with Egypt against his old enemies, the Hashemites and Nuri. ^he Lebanon, which was fearful of domination by a still uneuropeanised Muslim hinterland, naturally followed spit, regarding Egypt as more modernised and less fanatical than Syria and -i-raq. Memories of Ibrahim Pasha were even evoked to promote closer relations between the Lebanon and Egypt. Syria, which at the beginning was not enthusiastically pro-Egyptian, has gradually evolved towards Egypt owing to*the desire of the present governing elements in Syria to preserve the republican regime and their /apprehensions2 . 7 f apprehensions of Hashemite designs on Syria. King Farouk has always treated the ^mir Abdullah very superciliously anr] there is no love lost between them. Moreover inevitably a Hashemite Hmir, with his dreams of a Syrian throng would find himself in the opposite camp to that of the present Syrian rulers. It was equally inevitable thatj in spite of rivalries between Abdullah and the Iraqi Hoyal Family over Syria, the two Hashemite powers should find themselves standing together against the Egyptian bloc. '“I ' 1 . x 2. The latest phase of these developments has been the movement towards the conclusion of treaties between Hgypt and Saudi Arabia, with the suggested adherence of Syria, and between Egypt and the Lebanon. The Hashemites are thus tending to be isolated in the Arab League. 3. rhe movement towards Arab Union, encouraged by our declaration of sympathy towards any attempt of the Arabs to get together, started with the genuine desire to attenuate the balkanisation of Arab lands brought about mainly by the necessities of Anglo-French politics and with the equally genuine desire to protect Arab lands from outside encroachment. 4* Egypt took the lead, actuated at the beginning - largely by reasons of internal politics. Nahas Pasha wished to strengthen his internal prestige by posing as a leader of the Arab world, and King Farouk wishes to strengthen his throne by assuming a similar role. King Ibn Saud was from the beginning opposed to the idea of Arab Union because he feared : ion it would mean a Hashemite dominate of the Fertile Crescent with the consequent danger to his own position in the Heiaz. ri ence his determination to sa boter any northern combination. The Lebanon was determined to preserve its complete independence in order to avoid absorption in a Muslim Bloc. The attitudes of the Lebanon and Ibn Saud led to the emasculation of the corporate idea of the League and that of the Lebanon to the attentuation of any executive function of the League, such as / that1 /&lt;r © that involved in compulsory arbitration. Ibm Saud and the i- Lebanon were kept within the League largely by the influence of Lgypt, whose support in the Council they regarded as a guarantee against the dangers which they saw in it to their respective countries. Syria, after aiming at the creation of a Greater Syria under the rule of Damascus, acquiesced in the maintenance of the present divisions of the western part of the fertile Crescent. This acquiescence was due to the fear that prosecution of the idea of a Greater Syria 'would drive the Lebanon bock into French arms. Syrian acquiescence was no doubt also partly due to the influence of Egypt, whose assistance if needed for its emancipation from France and for support against Hashemite designs; , 5. It is clear from all this that the influence of i- &amp; determining factor in the present evolution of Arab States. ^t is also clear that the Hashemites are being •i : relegated to the background, largely owing to Egyptian manipulation oi their rivals. This is not a‘happy state of ' affairs. We are under obligation to the Hashemites for the role they played in the last war and for their stabilising influence in Transjordan.; and -^-raq. As things are at present, in the Arab world it is not in our interests that Hashemite prestige should be weakened in those two countries. 1 submit, therefore, that our efforts should be directed agaiist the isolation of the Hashemites within the Arab League. If we make representat ions to I bn Saud against exclusive treaty making, we should make similar representations to King Farouk and the Egyptian Lovernment. We can justify these representations by our desire to promote union among our Egypto-Arab friends and to remove the danger that the present discords may wreck the League. 6. Arab Union has now been realised on paper by the formation of an Egypto-Arab Bloc of independent units preserving their often conflicting policies of the pre-League period. There will no doubt be much frictionbetween the members of the League and without our good offices these frictions are likely to end in a relaxation, if net disintegration of the4 (l ( 3 &gt; league. It may no doubt be argued by some, on the principle of divide and rule, that such disintegration would hot be contrary to our interests. '“hile on a short term view this ia an arguable proposition, I feel that you will agree that an a long term view it is to our advantage that the Egypto- Arab world should not be distracted by internecine conflicts which will expose it not only to British but also to Russian penetration. Moreover, the balkanisation of the Arab world leads to material retrogression which militates to provoke discontent in a large area lying across our lines of communiactior and containing our vital oil supplies. 1 suggest, therefore, that we have a long term interest in promoting through Arab cooperation the material welfare and the satisfaction of the sentimental aspirations of these countries as far as our imperial interests permit. these aspirations, though often obscured by rivalries such as I have described, nevertheless constitute a permanent factor in the relations of these countries with Great Britain and moreover in the stability of the whole Middle East. 7. At present it may be said that the only aims on which all these States are united are those of getting rid of the French from Syria and of preventing the Zionist domination of Palestine. Whatever discords may weakdn the Arab League in the immediate future, we must count on its being united on these two issues.
