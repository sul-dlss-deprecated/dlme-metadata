Characteristic features of Iznik wares include a hard, white body, crystal-clear glaze, a wide range of brilliant colors, and an elegant painting style.\r\n\r\nOttoman ceramic artists took much of their inspiration from nature and created designs incorporating both recognizable plants, flowers, and trees and stylized leaves. Familiar species depicted on the objects here include roses, tulips, carnations, hyacinths, and cypress trees.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/36789", "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "Ottoman Dynasty", "OnView": 1, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:26:47.703", "Creator": "Turkish", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL7_48.1312_DetA_BW.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL7_48.1312_DetA_BW.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL7_48.1312_DetA_BW.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL7_48.1312_DetA_BW.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL7_48.1312_DetA_BW.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1501462", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "PL7_48.1312_DetA_BW.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Centre Street: Third Floor: Islamic Art"}
