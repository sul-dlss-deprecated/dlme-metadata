In accordance with instructions from the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, an Electrical Officer visited this Base recently to examine and report on the Base Power Supply. 2. As far as can be ascertained at present thore are no more large additions expected,with the exception of a proposal to air condition all sleeping quarters in tho Base. 3. The present connected load at the R.N.Base, including the Transmitting station is 82 Kilowats. 4. The ultimate connected load will be 147 Kilowats, with the addition of whatever is required for air-conditioning mentioned in paragraph 2. 5. The present maximum demand ap- ears to be in the region of 90 Ailowats, however, it is expected that this will increase to 60 Kilowats before the end of the summer. 6. In accordance with the Bahrain Government Electrical Supply Departments No.NT/37/61 dated 5th Jnauary 1943, it was agreed that total supply of 60 Kilowats would bo made available for the Royal Navy 7. As it will be some time before final decision will be made by Admiralty regarding supply of increased power, it is requested that I may be informed if the Bahrain Government would bo agreeable to The Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, endeavouring to hasten supply of new equipment for the Bahrain Government, in order to avoid any further load on existing machinery. 8. It is alj^s requestea that I may be informed if the Bahrain Govern o it would be ared to earmark a further 60 Kilowats for t ie Ptoyal Navy on receipt of this new machinery. 9. It is suggested, subject to the approval of tho Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, that when this matter has been satisfactorily arranged, a formal agreement should be drawn up between the Bahrain Govern ent and the Royal Navy to cover a period of 2 e*' &lt;3 years or less, until such, time as the Admiralty have opportunity make final arrangements regarding power supply to the R.N.Base.

ELECTRICAL POV/ER SUPPLY - R.N.BA8E, BAHRAIN. Reference your letter No.39 dated 7th July 1944. The Bahrain Government can meet all immediate requirements including increases in load which are expected in the latter part of this year. We can also guarantee an additional power supply up to 60 Kilowatts after the installation of a new generating unit. This unit is expected to be delivered in 1945. Any assistance that would contribute to expediting this unit would be welcome. The question of distribution of more power through the high tension line to Jufair requires consideration. The H.T. line is already very heavily loaded, It is an overhead line not a cable, owing to corroding part of all of it requires renewal and a thicker cable is desirable. The Bahrain Government would be willing to consider making an agreement to supply power for a period of 2 years after installation of the new generating unit subject to revision after this period.
