It should at the same time be pointed out to them that they will be subject to the same contract laws as free labourers, and that, should t iey^ at any time refuse to maintain themselves, it may have to be considered whether they should not be sent back to the place whence they were brought.

I have communicated to Sir Lloyd Mathews the contents of ^ oui Loidship s Despatch No. 46, oi the 22nd of February last, as I knew that the Zanzibar Government were desirous of procuring labour for their plantations; and he has now informed me that he would be prepared to find employment in the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba for any emancipated slaves whom the Indian Government may be willing to send here, in moderate numbers, from Turkish Arabia.' If fifty or so were sent here at a time, and provided they were able-bodied and \\illiii^ to work, Sir Lloyd would give them holdings on the Government estates at Duiiga (Zanzibar) and Eas Tundawa (Pemba). In return for their holdings, which would be as much as they could cultivate, they would be expected to give eight hours' labour gratis for three and one half days in the week on the estate, and for the remaining three and one half days they would be permitted to cultivate their holdings entirely for their own benefit, or if they worked for Government to receive the regular wage of a free labourer according to the market rate. They would also receive at the commencement of each clove season a suit of clothes each, representing about ten days' wages, and regular rations during the picking of the clove crop, and at the feast at the end of llamadan (the Eed el Futr) a gratuity equivalent to a week's pay each. Extra pay would also be given for extra piece-work This arrangement, which Sir Lloyd Mathews finds after some failures is beginning to answer fairly well, though it can hardly, from the landlords view, be pronounced a complete success on his own private estate at Ivoani, and is about to be introduced into the Government plantations is being imitated by the Sultan, who has ordered the other landowners since the publication of the Decree of the 6th instant, to endeavour to carry it out as far as is practicable throughout the islands, and it is probably as favourable to the interests of the agricultural labourer as any system in vogue elsewhere. I I these emancipated slaves were averse to an agricultural life, and preierred to earn money, supposing them to have the abilities requisitefor the purpose, either as town labourers or as hamals or carriers, Sir Lloyd Mathews believes that it would be quite feasible to arrange for their employment in that eapacity by the numerous European mercantile firms here; in which case they would receive no holding or house, but a regular daily wage, paid weekly or monthly according to the nature of the contract. It is probable that these freed slaves could be utilized in much the same way on the mainland, and I should be quite ready to receive one hundred (I had rather not have more at first till we see how they answer) at Mombasa, where both the Railway and certainly the Public Works and Shipping Departments could find regular employment for them, as carriers and town labourers. Their settlement on agricultural holdings on the coast would present greater difficulties than in the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba, for the Government has no plantations there under regular supervision, and most of the land belongs to Arabs and Swahilis and is cultivated on the ' Metayer ' system by their slaves. But we could allow them, if they wished, to settle at Mwele, where there is abundant and fairly good land waiting for cultivation, provided they had earned enough money to feed themselves and their families during the eight months or so which must elapse between their settlement and their getting in their first crop. Much must depend upon the antecedents and past habits of the slaves, as well as on the class of work to which they have been accustomed. The domestic slave born and bred in an Arab household in Arabia proper (a class known in this country as ' wazalia '), and trained to follow their masters, according to the fashion of the Oman, as armed retainers, would probably not be suitable for any kind of agricultural or porterage work, and any importation of freed slaves of this class would indeed constitute a very undesirable addition to our population both here and on the ' mainland. But ordinary agricultural freed slaves, employed in the date 1 plantations, or accustomed to manual labour, whether born or not in Arabia, would probably be very useful, and both here and at Mombasa we would gladly arrange for their reception.

From Assistant Political Agent, Basrah, No. 433, dated thel6th July 1896. To Assistant Political Agent, Basrah, No. 361, dated the 25th July 1896. 2. As regards the two applications made to him by manumitted slaves for free passages to Bahrein and Maskat, the opinion I have expressed to him that ho was right in refusing to accede to such applications will, I trust, be considered correct. For if we do deport a manumitted slave from the place of his manumission, such deportation should be, I imagine, to a place w r here there are no slaves and not to one where slavery is still existant.

The number of slaves who have during the past two years obtained manumission at Basrah through the good offices of Her Majesty's Consul there is placed in margin (weekly returns of all such are kept and sent to Her Majesty's Embassy at Constantinople). 4. At Maskat very many Africans manumitted under treaty arrangements have been for years past sent by British Indian craft to Bombay at a small charge for their passages (food being also provided to them), and it appears to me that some facilities for leaving the country in which they have been in slavery might be afforded by the British Government to the numerous slaves now continually manumitted at Basrah by orders of the Sultan of Turkey, but doubtless under pressure from us; and I would ask that I and Her Majesty's Consul at Basrah may be allowed to deport to India manumitted slaves (desirous of leaving Turkish Arabia) if such can be done at small expense. i No. 433, dated the 16th July 1896, From— Captain J.

I have the honour to inform you that two African slaves* recently manumit ted have applied to me for free passages to Maskat and Bahrein respectively. 2. It does not appear to have been the custom at this Consulate to provide such passages, and I have been unable to trace on the files any instructions bearing on the point. 3. I have declined to accede to the applications pending a reference to you for orders, and I shall be glad if you will inform me whether I am authorised to grant free passages in such cases. 4. I would in conclusion request that you will cause me to be supplied with the marginally-noted book for use ' Instructions for c^iidance of naval cfficera em- i n fljo offipp of this rrm«»nlitA ployed ia the suppression of slave trade,' Oc u illlS vOnSUiaie.No. 361, dated the 25th July 1896.

As regards the two applications forming subject of your reference to me, I am of opinion that you were right in not acceding to them. 3. I am, however, making a reference to the Government of India as to whether you should not be allowed to pay such small passage-money (as you may be able to arrange for, together with a sufficient allowance per diem for food) for the conveyance to India (by native Indian craft proceeding from your port to Karachi or Bombay) of slaves manumitted in Basrah who may apply to you for such passages. 4. I am unable to supply you with a copy of ' Instructions to naval officers employed in the suppression of the slave trade:' such instructions are, I believe (except of course to naval commanders), only furnished to Consular Courts having Vice-Admiralty jurisdiction (such as Mask at and Bushire). 2 G.

I observe that the Goyernment of Bombay report that the heinous offences for which extradition is granted to Lahej are confined to offences enu merated in the Foreign Jurisdiction and Extradition Act, and that the condi tion referred to in paragraph 4 of my despatch No, 17 (Secret), dated the 22nd of July 1898, is observed. Your Excellency in Council has agreed that the practice, thus limited and defined, of surrendering criminals may be continued in respect to offenders from tribal areas other than Lahej, and such sur renders would, I presume, be granted only when a 'prima facie case had been established to the satisfaction of the Resident. Your proceedings have my approval. 3. I note that the practice in respect of the manumission of slaves at Maskat is that now described by Major Fagan in his memorandum dated the 23rd of January 1899, enclosed in Colonel Meade's letter of the 19th of Febru- ary 1899. Upon this I desire to offer the following observations. It is reported that the practice inaugurated by Commander Haker has now been altered, and that slaves who have taken refuge on Her Majesty's vessels within Maskat waters will be sent to the Consulate. In connection with this, it is desirable to call the attention of the Political Agent at Maskat to section 99, et seq., of the general instructions for the guidance of the Captains and Commanding Officers of Her Majesty's ships-of-war employed in the suppression of the slave trade. Those instructions are still in force and must be followed. With regard to Major Pagan's description of the existing practice when a slave applies for freedom at the Consulate, I understand that the Sultan's consent to the manu mission of a new slave, in every instance, or to that of an old slave when the Consul considers that a case of cruelty or inhuman treatment is made out, would not be refused. I have thought it necessary to call the attention of Your Excellence's Government to these points, because the Sultan's consent may, under f e circumstances described in General Instruc tions, paragraph 99, not be required at all, and in other circumstances will not be refused. I have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship's most obedient humble Servant, GEORGE HAMILTON. S E—SM—Sept, 1 No- 2. ; i * &gt;■■MB PROCEEDINGS OF THE FOREIGN DEPARTMENT, SEPTEMBER 1899. Pro.

British government officials in London and India discussed the practicalities of sending freed slaves to Britain’s possessions in East Africa, where freed slaves could be employed in the region’s agricultural plantations (folio 13 onwards).In December 1897 Captain Hugh Daly, Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, wrote to the Political Resident (Lieutenant-Colonel Malcome Meade), requesting him to liaise with Her Majesty’s acting Consul-General at Zanzibar, Basil Cave, to arrange for the dispatch of freed African slaves to be repatriated at Zanzibar (folio 23). A batch of correspondence from 1899/1900 documents the arrangements made by the Political Resident (then Major Percy Cox) to send eleven liberated slaves to Zanzibar. Particular attention is paid to keeping the cost of the freed slaves’ passage back to Africa to a minimum.The remainder of the file covers the period 1897 to 1905, and deals with specific cases of emancipated slaves being dispatched to Zanzibar, either from the Political Residency in Bushire or the Political Agency in Muscat. This includes a report written by the Political Resident (Major Charles Kemball) in Nov 1902 outlining the numbers of slaves transported over a two year period (1900-1902) from Muscat to Zanzibar, including method and cost of transport (folio 82).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>James Orton</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Francis Warden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Būshehr</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Abū-Shahr</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Hormuz Isle</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Slave trade</topic></subject><subject><topic>Treaties</topic></subject><subject><topic>Slave emancipation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000ad#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
