Cairo No. 1843, SECRET. x At interview with Soviet Ambassador on June 2nd I told him there were certain important recent developments in the inter national situation which I wished to discuss on a confidential basis with him and his Government. We had been surprised that the Soviet Government should have chosen the moment of Rashid Ali‘s revolt to appoint a Minister to Iracu The Ambassador interjected that, as far as ho kneva the Soviet representative had never taken up his post, I asKed whether it was the Government^ intention that he should now do so to the newly constituted Government, and M. Maisky clearly thought that this was the procedure contemplated. I continued that this event seemed to make it desirable that I should make plain the policy of His Majesty’s Government in the Middle East. The action taken in respect of Rashid Ali was only one example of our determination to maintain our position throughout the Middle East, including Iran (Persia) and Afghanistan. We had no intention of allowing our interests m those countries to be attacked or .undermined. We fully realised that the German Government were intriguing in every possible way against our interests in the Middle East and that they hopea, by these intrigues, to bring British and Soviet interests into conflict. There was, however, no reason, given good-will on both sides ? why the German Government should be successful in thus stirring up trouble between the British and Soviet Governments in the Middle East, provided that there was no misunderstanding between the two Governments as to their respective positions. The Ambassador here indicated assent. . 2 . I continued that we intended to maintain our rights and interests as at present existing in all countries of the Middle East, while disclaiming any intention to enlarge these interests at the expense of any third Power. I assumed that the Soviet Government were resolved to_ pirn sue _ a similar policy. 14- I should like to be assured on this point. If both our Governments based themselves on these same principles, it ought to be. impossible for she German Government to succeed in making mischief between us in the Middle East, 3. I then explained that from the information available to us, it was clear that Germany was making considerable con 7 centrations, of land, mechanised and air forces, against^Soviet Russia, I had no doubt that the Ambassador was bettor informed than I could be on this subject, but I thought that I should tell him nf wo were taking in the Mid.ile East»- I m\ 2 . were continuing the reinforcement of our Middle East. We Army and Air Force there by all possible means. In respect of the air we were being greatly helped by American machines which were beginning to arrive in the Middle East and would continue to do so in the next few weeks on an ever-increasing scale. In consequence we considered that we were now in a position to hold our own in the air against any forces that Germany could bring against us in the Eastern theatre. Should the Germans divert elsewhere a part of their Air Force at present concentrated against us in the Near East, e.g. against Soviet Russia, we should be in a position to take useful offensive action to relieve pressure against Russia. 4. After some further conversation on the position in Eastern Mediterranean and Iraq, Ambassador questioned me closely about Turkey. I said that we were aware, of course, that Turkey was under severe pressure from Germany but that they were holding out against concessions asked of them and were keeping us informed. The Ambassador asked whether German demands were economic only or went beyond that and were political also. I replied that I imagined that Germany would follow her usual practice, beginning with modest demands and seeking subsequently to widen the gap. I suggested that if the Soviet Government wished to know more they should ask the Turks themselves. The Ambassador replied that he was not sure that the Turks would welcome such an enquiry. I rejoined that I had no reason to suppose that this would be the Turkish attitude and if his Government wished I was perfectly willing to make such a sounding of the Turks myself on his behalf. As I had told the Ambassador on a previous occasion, we desired to see relations between the Soviet and Turkish Governments as close and cordial as possible. The Ambassador deprecated such action, saying that he only wished to clear his own mind as to the true position. 5. Mo Maisky then enquired whether I was convinced that the information which I had given him about German concentra tions against the Soviet Union was accurate. I replied that it was always difficult to be absolutely certain on these matters, but that the information I had given him was given in good faith, and we believed it to be correct. The Ambassador said that he found it very hard to believe that Germany contem plated taking military action against the Soviet, since that would be a very big undertaking. While M. Maisky expatiated with emphasis on the strength of the Russian military position, I had a feeling that he might be trying to convince himself as he went along. 6 . M. Maisky said that it was possible that all these concentrations might be part of a war of nerves. I agreed, and said that we did not attempt to deduce the purpose for which the Germans v/ere taking this action, and I thought it quite possible that they hoped by these means to force from the Soviet Government concessions that it was not in their national interest to give. 7. M. Maisky then said that he supposed that I had made this communication to him as an indication of my Government’s desire to improve relations. Could I not carry matters a little further? He had often spoken to me in the •past about the difficulty created by the Baltic question. Could we not make a further effort to reach agreement on this • 0 •r Vv EXT. 3474 | 1 gw] i i Jg-;- } • 0 B this issue? I replied that we were ready to settle this question, hut I could not see that any lasting good v/ould de. 7e from our making concessions to' them on the Baltic question without any corresponding concessions being made by the Soviet Government. I did not believe in a policy of appeasement tov/ards Soviet Russia or anyone else, as 1 had explained on a previous occasion. M. Maisky maintained that there should be no question of appeasement. At the same time he assumed that we did attach importance to improving relations with the Soviet. Recently his Government had made an agreement with Sweden about the Baltic States. Could not we at least consider^drawing up a plan in which we would show what we were prepared to offer to the Soviet in connexion with the Baltic and what we hoped to receive from them in return? If we had such__a plan, it might then be possible to make progress. I told M. Maisky that I was prepared to consider his suggestion and askea him whether meanv/hile he v/ould be good enough to give me his Government’s comments on the communication I had made to him. Clearly if the Soviet Government were able to assure us that they intended to pursue a policy in the Middle East similar to our own and if they had no intention of joining with the Germans in any of the plans so much canvassed in the press against Iran. Iraq. and ourselves, then the atmosphere would be a belter one in &lt; which to consider what next step v/as possible. M. Maisky said that he v/ould certainly report what I had said to his Government and v/ould come and see me again when he had his Government‘s reply.SECRET OUTWARD*”TE — I wCc [This Document Is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be kept under Lock and Key.] ^ ’ Q r\ &gt; /» i iL ^S&gt; * w 0 ' [This telegram is of particular se&lt;jr9c$- ind iiould / he retained hy the authorised'ruiiipiunl and^not ^ passed on].

Official Soviet attitude towards ex- mandated territories such as Iraq has always been that they are not yet genuinely independent but rather disguised colonies subject to imperial exploitation. And while that attitude might not by itself have prevented Soviet Government from recognising Iraq at a [? group omitted] stage, they were no doubt also aware that when the question was first raised last # year His Majesty’s Government were opposed to establish ment of a Soviet Legation at Bagdad and could probably have brought sufficient pressure on Iraq to prevent its establishment 0 5 . I do not on the other hand, believe that published version is correct in attributing the whole v&gt; v - initiative to Iraq side (see Bagdad teleg ram No, 662 of 194-0), In my pinion at any rate, but for ; ' difficulties meniioned above, their primary motive both then and now being the wish to keep watchon, and where possible counteract, German diplomatic and fifth column activities in the Middle East, Indeed that motive should be even stronger now than it was before (see Tehran telegram No, 210). Desire to spread communist pr:paganda~probably~was and still is a secondary motive only, since Soviet Government must realise political disintegration, inevitably attendant to any success of such rropaganda in early stages? would play into German hands.2 , 4. Establishment of relations with Iraq at the precise moment when that country fell foul of us and appealed for German help was also no doubt dictated by the desire of Soviet Government (1) to 'get back at' His Majesty’s Government for the latter’s policy of economic pressure, both direct and through united States Government, which beyond question they strongly resent, however unavoidable it may be from our point of view and (2) to placate Germany at this critical moment for- Soviet-German relations, by a gesture which at any rate prima facie is favourable to Germans and costs them nothing 0 Nevertheless on evidence at present available I consider these also to be secondary motives only, though coincidence of v - •. date with action against Yugoslavia and ether changes may have some deeper significance.

Your telegram No. 662 and Moscow telegram No. n 979 [of November 7th and tTth;' Iraqi-Soviet relations]. I see no advantage to Iraqi Government or to ourselves in establishment of diplomatic relations between Iraq and the Soviet Union. Neither country has at present any interests in the other. On the other hand I agree with your view that there would be many potential disadvantages. The establishment of a Soviet mission at Bagdad might be a step in a renev/ed Russian drive to the Persian Gulf, and it would certainly be widely regarded as such. Mission’s general policy would no doubt be to make trouble for us and undermine our position in the Middle East, where the Russians, with German backing, may at any moment become extremely active. It must also be remembered that Soviet frontier is sufficiently near to Iraq to make penetration of all kinds an unpleasant possibility. 2. From the point of view of Anglo-Soviet relations I do not think that general policy of Soviet Government, or their attitude towards British diplomatic and consular representation in the Soviet Union and Central Asia, would justify a decision to encourage the establishment of closer relations between Iraq and the Soviet Union in spite of the serious disadvantages of the proposal from every other point of view. 3.

Minister for Foreign Affairs related that Russian.delegate in 1933 and again in 1933 had made similar suggestion to him at Geneva and that Soviet Ambassador at Angora had also spoken in the same sense when passing through Bagdad on his way to Tehran for wedding of the Crown Prince in 1939. On each occasion however evasive reply had been given. 2. Minister for Foreign Affairs said that Government did not wish to act on the matter without consulting His Majesty's Government and need not reply to the informal enquiry made at Angora but I received the impression that he was now disposed to favour the exchange of diplomatic missions with the Soviet Government. 3*. Subject to wider considerations I see from the local view point no advantages and many potential disadvantages. In the present state of Anglo-Soviet relations the presence of Soviet mission.in Bagdad would give rise to the risk of hostile political intrigues and I foresee additional danger of spread of Communistic propaganda among the masses in Iraq who are ill- equipped to resist its insidnous appeal. 4. . It does not seem that the presence of Soviet mission would bring to Iraq any advantages to compensate for these risks and once established it is not likely to be withdrawn. From our point.of view I am inclined to think that the fewer diplomatic missions in Iraq and perhaps other Arabic countries or in Egypt the better and we do not want to accelerate revival of Russian ambitions in the Persian Gulf and [grp. undec].
