Arrangements are now being made for the transport of these weapons to Bahrein but it is not known when they will leave Egypt or how they will arrive. The Government of India has been approached and asked to notify the Sheikh of the intended gift through its Political Resident, Persian Gulf. 2, The visit of H.R.H. the Duke of Gloucester to Bahrein seems an admirable opportunity of conveying the news to the Sheikh in a manner which will please him most. 3, It is proposed that the guns be manned by the Army detachment, under command of Tenth Army, now stationed in the Island.

Have just had your Royal Highness*telegram No.1/535 of June 8th and have discussed with Wavell and Air Officer Commanding in Chief. Latter tells me no difficulty arises over supply of aircraft and that he had already told Mideast that in view of difficult weather con ditions at this time of year he thought it most desirable that he should provide aircraft, experienced Captain and crew for air journeys in India. He remains strongly of view and does not consider it would be wise to do otherwise. 2. As regards Staff Air Officer Commanding in Chief tells me that he has specially attached Air Commodore Williams who is his Senior Air Staff Officer because in India with its great distances lack of meteorological information poor communications and rapid changes of weather it is essential to leave someone of considerable air experience and authority to make quick and sound decisions in regard to flying. He strongly recommends leaving Williams (who has already gone down to Karachi) with Your Royal Highness. 3 * 1 feel Your Royal Highness will agree with me that we must defer to considered views of experts. A great line clearly rests upon them. For exactly the reasons given by Air Officer Commanding in Chief I had myself to agree to / WilliamsWilliams (whoia X c€ui most* strongly conKnend to you) accoispanylug me when I recently did an extensive air tour in Southern India; and I hope in the light of Air Officer Colananding , a views Your Royal Highness may feel able to accept his recommendations on both points ends.Translation of a letter dated 24th Jamadi I, 13ol (9th June 1942) from H.H.Shaikh Salman bin Hamad to the Political Agent, Bahrain. in which you have informed me about the arrival of the honourable visitor at 5-30 p.m. and that owing to the strong Shamal he may arrive earlier than the fixed time.

The Hon # hie the Political Bealdent in the Persian Qul£ t Bushlre. Sir, I have the honour to submit a brief report on the recent visit to Bahrain of H.H.K. the Duke of Gloucester. 2. the first Intimation I received of the visit was on the evening of June 5th when Major Hewitt, Defence Officer, informed me that he had been instructed by Headquarters, L.F.C., 9 Basrah to take all necessary security measures in connection with His Boyal Highness* visit. In his instructions it was mentioned that His Boyal Highness would arrive at Bahrain at 14.00 hours 0»M.T. on June 6th, would stay the night with the ‘Political Adviser *, and would leave again on June 7th. 3. necessary arrangement® for the reception of His Koyal Highness were at once undertaken: and on the afternoon of Jbne 6th, an hour before the aeroplane was due to arrive, H.H. the Shaikh and members of his family were waiting on the aerodrome at yuharraq. The Defence Officer then received a further signal to the effect that His Boyal Highness would arrive on June 9th instead of June 6th. Arrangements for June 6th were therefore cancelled. 4. un June 7th I informed you by telegram of His Boyal Highness 1 proposed visit, and received on the following day your telegram In reply saying that the Duke of Gloucester would inform His Highness the Shaikh of the gift of two captured Italian gunswith 1000 rounds of ammunition. 5. At 5«0 p.m. on June 9th, half an hour before the scheduled time of arrival, the aircraft in which His Boyal Highness was travelling landed at Muharraq aerodrome* His Boyal Highness was the first to descend from the aeroplane, and I introduced myself to him* The National Anthem was played by the band of the State Police, and I then made the following presentations*- (1) H.H* Shaikh Salman bin Hamad, Ruler of Bahrain. (2) Shaikh Muhamiad bin Isa, uncle of the Ruler of Bahrain* (3) Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa, Uncle of the Ruler of Bahrain. (4) Shaikh Said bin 1/iaktum, Ruler of Dubai. fS) Air Commodore Russell, D.F.C.. O.C., 215 Group, Basra. (6J ISr.C.D. Belgrave, Adviser to the Bahrain Covernmen (7) Lt*-Commander v.T.King, Naval Officer in Charge, Bahrain. (8) Major H.T. Hewitt M.C., Defence Officer, Bahrain. 6. After the presentations His Royal Highness, attended by H.H. the Shaikh of Bahrain and myself, inspected the Guard of Honour provided by the State Police. He then took his seat in H.H. the Shaikh’s car (on which the Bahrain pennant had been replaced by the Royal Standard) and, accompanied by His Highness and myself, drove to the Political Agency. 7. At the Political Agency His Highness the Shaikh took leave of the Duke after the latter had accepted an invitation to take coffee with His Highness at the Manama Palace at the hour of sunset. His Boyal Highness wa then shewn his rooms in the Agency, had tea, and was given a brief account of Bahrain and its recent history. 8* At sunset His Royal Highness arrived at the Palace where he was met at the foot of the steps by His Highness and his uncles. He was led, clasped firmly by the hnnd by His Highness, to the Reception Room where he took his seat on the right of the Shaikh. I sat on the right of the Duke in order to interpret. His Hi.ghness first presented his brothers, and then the sons of his two uncles. Coffee was then served. After the usual exchange of formal courtesies His Royal Highness / mademade a fev? appropriate remarks about His late Highness Shaikh Hamad, and then congratulated His Highness on his accession* Later the Duke informed His Highness of the gift of two Italian 105 millimetre guns, a communication which aroused in His High ness the liveliest feelings of pleasure and gratification* His Highness then presented to the Duke a sword with a gold hilt and a gold scabbard which had been in the possession of his family for many generations* He also presented to His Koyal Highness three Bahrain pearls of very fine quality. After a further exchange of courtesies, and after the visit had lasted about twenty minutes, His Royal Highness took his departure* 9* After a visit to the pool at Ardhari the Duke returned to the Agency, and was able to relax for the rest of the evening. A small, informal dinner party was he3.d at the Agency, a'nd it was after midnight before His Boyal Highness retired to his room* 10* At 9.15 a.m. on June 10th His Royal Highness left the Agency to drive to the aerodrome, where he was met by His Highness the Shaikh and his uncles. Shaikh Said bin Maktum, Ruler of Dubai^was also present. As His Royal Highness walked towards his aeroplane he consented to pause for a few moments while a photograph was taken of himself and Shaikh Salman• In bidding farewell oo His Royal Highness Shaikh Salman referred to the ties of ancient friendship which linked Bahrain to the British Crown, and affirmed that those ties were stronger now than ever, and would endure always* 11* The visit to Bahrain in 1938 of H.R.H. Princess Alice and the Sari of Athlone left the A1 Khalifah with a deep end lasting impression of loyal graciousness; and H.H* Shaikh Salman was deeply affected at the prospect of welcoming to his island the brother of His Majesty the King of England. Beforethe visit he entertained high hopes f but also some nervous apprehensions; after the visit he found that his apprehensions had been groundless and that his hopes had been fulfilled in a manner and to a degree which made his cup of happiness full to overflowing, 12, It only remains to say that the Boyal visit has been an unqualified success. Shaikh Salman’s feelings of loyalty to the Crown, never week, have been strengthened and intensi fied by his personal contact with His Hoyal Highness the Duke of Gloucester; and all members of the Khalifah are sensible of the honour which has been accorded to their family and to their country. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Political Agent, Bahrain,Telegram Inter/3, From Political Hesident, Bushire. To Political Agent, Bahrain, No.1120.

It is thought (following from Political Resident cO/t~« a f /&lt;isr telegram 1120 dated June 12th reference your telegram 418 ***X%tX ' ft June 11th) that quickest method of sending present of two guns and 1000 rounds for Shaikh will be by Bahrain Petroleum Company’s tanker from Suez, provided Navy have no objections. Please let me know if Company agree and inform Resident. 2. Last November Company very kindly carried two packages of kit for me to Suez by tanker and it would be great help if they could also take them back to Bahrain.

Political Agency, Bahrain, the 13th June 1942. To The Chief Local Representative, The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited Bahrain. Dear Sir, On his recent visit to Bahrain H.R.H. the Duke of Gloucester informed H.H. the Shaikh that he would shortly be presented with two captured 105 millimetre Italian guns and 1000 rounds of ammunition. The guns and ammunition are at present in Egypt, and it is desired to transport them to Bah rain as quickly as possible. It has been suggested by General Headquarters, Middle East, that the quickest method of effecting the transport would be by one of your tankers from Suez, and I have been asked to inquire whether you would agree to the adop tion of this plan. 2. Colonel Prior has also telegraphed to me to say that last November you very kindly carried two packages of kit for him to Suez by tanker; and he now inquires whether it would be possible for you to bring them back to Bahrain for him by the same means. If this is possible, and not inconvenient for you, perhaps you would advise your local agents at Suez? Yours truly, BahrainThe political .Agent, Memorandum y/' Reference your telegram No.411 dated 9th June 1942* Commanding Royal Air Force Sharjah about the visit of His Royal Highness the Duke and made the necessary arrangements to present the Shaikh of Sharjah to His Royal Hingness. Shaikh of Sharjah, accompanied by his brothers, Majid, Humaid and Hashid, his sons Saqr and Khalid and two -Secretaries, r Abdulla bin Paris and Ibrahim al Madfa* came to the Fort and waited in the lounge where they were served with refreshments. Itfhen the aircraft was sighted we all went out to the landmng ground and stood at. a distnace of 10 yards from the aircraft. The Shaikh*s guards, who were made to put on more decent clothes, were made to stand in a line about 20 yards behind us. As His Royal High ness came out of the aircraft he was met by the Officer Command ing Royal Air Force Sharjah v/ho introduced me to him and in turn I presented the Shaikh and his party to His Royal Highnes. As the Duke came out of the aircraft, all the guards fired one shot each and the Shaikh^ battery fired a salute of 15 guns (usually the Shaikhs fire two or three guns when they are visited by a Shaikh) in honour of His Royal Highness. The Shaikh also displayed his flag on his palace. The Agency flag was also flawn. 4. The Duke was then taken round by the Officer Commanding to inspect the Camp and then to the OfficerJh Mess for a light meal. While they were doing this I took back the Shaikh and his party x-o the lounge and looked after theme Few minutes before the departure of the aircraft all of us come out again and stood near the aircraft. Mien the Duke arrived the Shaikh said to His Royal Highness that he was very much honoured by the Duke’s visit In accordance with your orders I consulted the Officer Half aii hour before the arrival of the aircraft, theto Sharjah and wished that he had more time to spend in Sharjah so as to be able to bo afeibe to celebarte thse this auspicious occasion in a more befitting manner* The shaikh prayed for the victory of the British Government and the defeat of their enemies adding that Sharjah was under the orders of the British Governmenl for any service which may be required* He then wished His Royal Highness a safe and pleasant journey* His Royal Highness thanked the Shaikh for coming and for all that was shown and hoped that he Vould have the chance of meeting the shaikh again on his way back* Broadcast or the B.B.C. about the reception given by the shaikh will have a very good effect here, if you consider it appropriate and see no objection to it© I venture to suggest that a mention on the Bahrain Residency Agent,Sharjah®Telegram G.T.C.

(9.00 hours G.M.T. corresponds to 12.30 p.m. Bahrain local time). I was further asked to arrange lunch for the Duke and Major Kerr, for three B.O.R.s and for the aircraft crew of one officer and four other ranks. 3 # His Highness the Shaikh was informed of His Royal High ness 1 programme, and it was arranged that he should be present at the aerodrome, together with his uncles and Mr.Belgrave, at 11*46 a.m. on the day of the Duke’s arrival. 4 . At 11.30 a.m. on July 16th I was just leaving the Agency to go to the Aerodrome when I was informed on the telephone that the Duke had already arrived. 1 was at the Aerodrome within a few minutes, prepared to make my apologies; but His Royal Highness waved my apologies asidei He had sent a signal from the aircraft to say that he would arrive ahead of schedule, but the signal had not been received. It was subsequently ascertained that the signal was sent during one of the wireless ^black-outs' which oeriodically interrupt radio communication between Sharjah and Bahrain. /5.

The breach of No. 016525 does not operate easily owing to a small defect in the breachlocking latch, how ever I think this could be put right quite easily.

Memorandu m Reference my secret memorandum No. C/666 dated the 27th April 1943 about the 105 m.m. Italian guns to be presented to His Highness the Shaikh. 2* The local A.A. Detachment will be leaving this month and is not likely, I understand, to be replaced, it will net be possible, therefore, to tr&amp;ih a Bahraini gun crew as proposed in my memorandum No. C/358 dated the 13th of Karen. In these circumstances I think it would be wise for the Shaikh to be given a demonstration now that the guns do go off since, if the present opportunity is missed, it seems unlikely that he will ever see them fired. do not suggest that the guns should be presented to the Shaikh now (the paint has not yet arrived) but only that a demonstration firing should be held. 3. If you see any objection to a demonstration firing attended by His Highness the Shaikh would you kindly let me know by telegram on or before May 16th ? If I hear nothing from you I will assume that you have no objection to a demonstration firing. Political Agent, Bahraini 5) fccS TO, FT P.

Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. attested for Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.Note on the sword presented by His Highness Shaikh Salman bin Hamad AlKhalifah, Bahrain, to H.R.H. The Duke of Gloucester. In 1777 the Khalifah and their allies were living in the town of Zubara on the coast of the Qatar peninsula. From their headquarters at Zubara the Khalifah made frequent raids into Bahrain which was at that time nominally a Persian possession. In order to prevent attacks on Bahrain the Persians equipped a powerful expedition consisting of ev er 2,000 men against the Khalifah at Zubara. The Persians fleet arrived off the Qatar coast and landed the men at a place a little distant from Zubara. On a Friday during the hour of £&gt;rayer the Persians attacked Zubara, taking the Khalifah by surprise. Zubara wqs besieged for some time by the Persian troops who were commanded by Shaikh Nasr al Din Shah, Governor of Bushire. The eldest brother of the Khalifah Shaikhs commanded the garrison in the town in the absence of Mohammed bin Khalifah, the chief of the Khalifah, who was on the pilgrimage. After suffering great privations the Khalifah determined to risk all in making a sortie. A few men were left in the fort with orders to kill all the women sooner than let them fall into the hands of the enemy if they saw the Khalifah being defeated. Flinging open the doors of the fort the Khalifah rushed out and threw themselves on the enemy. Then, in the words of an Arab historian 'The sword game and the spear play commanded., heads flew away from ?2 bodies and warriors attacked with cries that melted cowardly hearts”. Finally the Persians were beaten and driven back to their boats. During the battle Shaikh Nasr T s sword and the swords of several of the Persian chiefs fell into the hands of the Khalifah and the sword now presented to His Royal Highness The Duke of Gloucester is one of these captured swords. A few years later, in 1783, the Khalifah finally drove the Persians out of Bahrain and became the rulers of Bahrain. 3.Z ——D. 0. No* C/1024 Dated the 29th July 1943. I promised you, long ago, a note about the sword presented to His Royal Highness when he visited Bahrain last year. Here it is. I am sorry for the delay in sending it, but a certain amount of research had to be carried out to ensure historical accuracy. It is the blade of the sword, of course, which is really old* The scabbard was made Cor at least decorated) in more recent times. Major Howard Kerr, C*M*G*,0*B*B*,M.V.O., Equerry to His Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester, York House, \ St. James* Palace, With kindest remembrances, dames' raxace, London * S#W* 1June „;942 The Ruling Family of Bahrain are known as the A1 Khalifah. In 1766 the A1 Khalifah emigrated from Kuwait and settled at Zubara, on the western shore of the '&gt;atar Peninsula, In the course of the next 16 years they acquired considerable power, and in 1782 were strong enough to make a successful raid on the island of Bahrain, at that time a Persian possession. The Ruler of Shiraz, annoyed by this act of aggression, resolved ‘ ''or all the growing power of the A1 n expeditionary force, more than 2000 strong and commanded by Mohammad, a nephew of Shaikh Nasir ud Din Shah, set sail for the Qatar Peninsula, and landed at a place a little distant from Zubara. By launching a surprise attack on a Friday during the hour of prayer the Persians gained an initial advantage; but the Al Khalifah resisted obstinately, and the operations later settled down into a formal seige of Zubara* During this seige the Al Khalifah suffered great pri vations, and eventually they determined to risk everything in a sortie, A few men were left in the beseiged fortress with orders to kill the women and children rather than allow them to fall into the hands of the enemy if the battle went Against \ : v V . , j. . J ■ \ the Al Khalifah* the rest of the forces flung open the gates of the fortress and threw themselves on the enemy* Then, in the words of an Arab historian, n The sword game and the spear \ Khalifah, He therefore ordered Shaikh Nasir ud Din Shah, i Governor of Bushire, to equip an expedition for an attack on\V 0 2 play commenced? heads flew away from bodies and warriors attacked with cries that turned cowardly hearts to water’ 1 . After a desperate struggle the farces of the A1 Khalifah prevailed and the Persians, after their commander, Shaikh Mohammad, had been killed, were driven back to their boats. Included in the booty taken from the Persians was the sword presented by His Highness Shaikh Sir Salman bin Hamad A1 Khalifah, K.C.I.E., Buler of Bahrain, to His Koyal Highness the Duke of Gloucester in the summer of 1942. ’ i ' H It is of interest to record that later in the year ' 1783 the Al Khalifah followed up their success at Zubara ju by attacking Bahrain and driving out the Persians. Since f j then the Al Khalifah have been Hulers of Bahrain. oOo.0 *O» 2 f o* 1458 « 30th October 1943. Please refer to the correspondence ending with your telegram Ho.1067 dated may 12th* 2* I understand from Hewitt that while painting was in progress one of the guns has been damaged beyond local repair. The damage does not impair the appearance of the piece but does render it unuseable professionally. Hot altogether a disadvantage. 3. The weapons are now ready to be delivered to His Highness and I see from my files that there was a sug gestion that they should be formally presented by you on a suitable occasion. I suggest however that in order not to inspire jealousy among princes whose territories do not include a fine landing ground used by aircraft bearirtg 'Very Important rersons' backwards and forwards to the East a formal ceremony might be dispensed with. If you agree, the guns could be handed over by the Defence Officer as an official duty and I would write an official letter to His Highness informing him that they are the g’ift of General Headquarters, middle East.
