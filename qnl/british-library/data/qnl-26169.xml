The expenditure on these medical stores amounted to about £ 1 , 000 , and the arrangement was that (a) if the crisis developed the cost would be charged to Imperial revenues for adjustment with other emergency expenditure, and (b) if the crisis did not develop the stores would be absorbed by the civil hospital against future normal requirements. Presumably, as things turned out, procedure (b) was adopted; but we have no evidence to show what, if any, additional charge has been borne by Indian revenues as a result of the advance order and by reason of the r a transfer of Aden. Iw frhc -firot place, have been deterioration during storage at Aden, and, if so, half the loss would presumably be chargeable against Imperial revenues. 7 a proportion of the stores may not have been absorbed by the civil hospital before 1st April, 1937, in which/ Iwhich case the cost of the stores not thus aosorbed te presumably be debited against Imperial revenues.

I also enclose a statement which has been prepared in our Accounts Department setting out the special expenditure incurred at Aden and brought to account in 1935/6 and also up to the present date in 1936/7. As you will see from the Air Ministry letter enclosed we expect to receive a further claim for supplies estimated to cost between £400 and £500 on which there will be transport charges in addition. There may be further expenditure being incurred in Aden which we shall not know about till we get the Resident's accounts but we do not think it should be very much. In order to make the statement clear it has been completed by the addition of h.a.f. rumbold, esq.of the various supporting documents. These were about to be submitted to you officially - in so far as they relate to expenditure in 1935-6 - and as they are original documents the Accountant asks that they may be held in anticipation of official action which will now await your If reply to this. On the present basis you will see that India's liability for expenditure in 1935/6 amounts to £5,412.11.5 (ignoring receipts of interest) against which we ha’ve received £4,000, and in 1936/7 £131.9.2. In the event of acceptance by India of liability for these amounts perhaps you will be good enough to indicate in your reply whether your Department will agree to the sums in question being debited in the account with India for Aden etc.trans act ions maintained in the Colonial Office books. 3. Would it now be possible for you to let us know as soon as possible whether you are prepared to accept 50 per cent of the cost of this equipment, as was proposed to you in my letter of the 1st September?

Dear Blaxter, With reference to your letter, 6214/27/36 dated 1st October, regarding the supply of anti-gas equipment for the Civil population at Aden; you have asked us tv/o questions:- (a) Do we agree the 'make-up' of the charges on the two orders? and (b) To what extent are the articles etc., subject to deterioration etc? The answer to (a) is:- (i) We agree your statement (totalling £4,780.1.0) in respect of the first order. A further transportation charge, arising from this first order, amounting to £18.19.10. has been reported and must therefore be added to the £4,780.1.0. above. (ii) Your liability under the second order has been reduced to about £400 (plus transportation), as, following the receipt of Colonial Office letter 6214/27/ 36 dated 31st July 1936, we cancelled, without cost, the items for 150 tons of bleach powder and the 860 sets of protective clothing. Thus, you will only be required to pay for the goggles, ointment and paint included in the second order. The reply to (b) is:- In general terms ; it can be accepted that practically all the Equipment will suffer deterioration if kept in store for any length of time in Aden. In K. W. Blaxter, Esq. , Colonial Office, Dov/ning Street, S.V/. 1.In greater detail ; the following is an extract from a report on the individual items supplied under the separate orders:- 1st Order Oilskin clothing and gloves . Deterioration immediate. Tackiness developes and therefore essential that garments should hang free. Probable 'life” limited to one year even if stored under best conditions. Gum Boots . If stored under best conditions no appreciable deterioration during the first year. Probable 'life', say, 2 years. Cloth, union, anti-gas . Probable no appreciable deterioration in first two years. Strombos Korns . Practically all-metal but includes rubber hose. Latter if stored under suitable conditions should have a 'life' of, say, 2 years. Bleach Powder . Unopened containers should last for 4 years under tropical conditions. Periodical examination of the containers for signs of rusting through recommended. Contents of opened containers deteriorate rapidly. 2nd Order Goggles . Elastic headbands would probably perish within first year. Detector Paint . Stringent tests to ascertain effects of storage under tropical conditions have shown that after being kept for 18 months at 14Q°F. the contents of sealed tins of this paint have shown no appreciable loss of efficiency. Protectiverrotbctive Ointment . Progressive deterioration must be expected. Sample tins, from stocks held by the Stores and Supply Depot, Aden, recently tested at Porton, showed that after 9 months storage the available chlorine content would soon be below the permitted minimum if the present rate of loss continues. Probable life in store under Aden conditions 12 to 18 months. Periodical inspection of samples recommended.

The £7,600 is the round figure given by the Air Ministry for the whole cost of the equipment which they have ordered for us, viz. £4,400 representing the estimated cost of the first order and £3,200 in respect of the second order. Actually the cost of the first order, which has already been met by the Colonial Office, is as follows;- Horns, H.A.F. RUMB01D, ESQ. PECo. POL.

As you will see from our official letter to the Air Ministry of 22nd February 1936, a copy of which was sent to the India Office on 24th February the original order included, in addition to the above items, 150 tons of super tropical bleaching powder. Owing to a misunderstanding, however, the contract for the powder was not placed immediately and at the end of July last the Air Ministry suggested that, in view of the altered international situation, action to obtain the bleach need not be proceeded with. The Secretary of State accordingly agreed that the order should not be proceeded with until the Chiefs of Staff have made their report to the Committee of Imperial Defence on our strategic position vis-a-vis Italy, and the policy of His Majesty's Government has been decided. We are awaiting that report before considering the ultimateultimate fate of all this equipment. I am asking Connolly of the Air Ministry to let us know what articles are liable to suffer deterioration through being stored at Aden and will write to you further on receipt of his reply. Yours sincerely(§&gt; /Y-c. 6314/27/36. 6331 My dear Rumbold L 1936 j ^ Will you please reTer to your official 1 No.P.Z.1069/1936 of the 2nd of March and connected measures at Aden? We had thought that the equipment -which the Ministry have purchased (and are still purchasing) from contractors on our behalf, except in so far as it was used for training purposes, would probably be taken over eventually by that Department for their own use, but we have now heard from the Air Ministry that they are unable to do this. They state that the bulk of it will be of no use to the Royal Air Force and, in any case, certain of the articles will have suffered deterioration through being stored at Aden. After consultation, therefore, with the Treasury, we have come correspondence regarding the cost of civil emergency to H.A.F. RUMBOLD, FSQ.to the conclusion that we must accept the whole charge for this equipment on the Colonial and Middle Eastern Services Vote, and, as you know, this equipment is part of the civil emergency arrangements at Aden in respect of which the Government of India have agreed to contribute 50 per cent. At the time when I wrote my letter to Janes of the 8 th of April, we still thought that we should only need to treat as part of the emergency expenditure, about 10 per cent, of the equipment supplied by the Air Ministry but, as I have explained, we have now found that this is not possiole. It is clear, I think, that this expenditure on the equipment supplied by the Air* Ministry falls within the fifty-fifty arrangement. In this connection I would invite a reference to my letter to Hood of the 15th February and Walton's reply No.P.Z.1158/36 of the 20th February with regard to the second order, and to your letter to me No.P.Z.6621/35 of the 19th September, 1935, regarding♦ regarding the earlier order. Of course you wrote tnis latter letter 'before the agreement was reached that His Majesty’s Government and tne Government of India would hear this expenditure on a fifty-fifty basis. The latest round figures given by the Air Ministry for the.v/hole cost of the equipment which they have ordered for us is £4,400 in respect of the first order and £3,200 in respect of the second order. We are at present in communication with the Air Ministry with a view to cancelling as far as it may be possible, in view of the change in the international situation, tnose items in the second order which have not yet been supplied. It may, of course, not be possible to do much v/here contracts are already in course of execution. It will now be necessary for us to refund to the Air Ministry the total expenditure which they have incurred in obtaining all this equipment from the various contractors. We think it is clear that all this expenditure is part of the civil emergency measures to which the Government of India agreed that they would, contribute 50 per cent but 7/e shall« shall be grateful if you will confirm this. There is also the question of what is to done witn the 5,000 service type respirators about which we have also corresponded. Your letter to Hale No. P.Z. 2409/36 of tne lltn of April is, I think, tne latest communication on the matter. It has been agreed that 10 per cent, of tnese respirators which have been required for training purposes snould fall within the fifty-fifty arrangement without prejudice to v/hat is to be settled with regard to the remainder. It appears that, unlike the equipment referred to above wnich had to be specially ordered oy the Air Ministry for shipment to Aden, the service type gas masks were supplied by the War Office from stock and they are probably prepared to take back into stocK again the bulk of tnese respirators i.e. tnose not used for training. If that is the case, there will be no difficulty. It is not possible, nowever, yet to decide wnetner the unused respirators should be returned to tne War Office. The Chiefs of Staff areare at present examining tne position in the Red Sea area in the light of the changed position and, pending a decision on the future policy of his Majesty 1 s Government it is proposed to leave all the respirators at Aden. If, when the report of the Chiefs of Staff is considered, it is decided that it is unnecessary to retain these respirators at Aden in connection with anti-gas measures necessary to enable the civil administration to be maintained, and the War Office take them back into stocx, no difficulty will arise. If, however, either the War Office are for any reason, unable to taKe them back into stock or the decision is that it is desirable to retain them permanently at Aden for the above purpose, then the question will arise whether the Government of India should be asked to include the cost of these respirators in the fifty-fifty arrangement. I do not thinx we need debate this at the moment, but I mention the question as being one that is still not finally disposed of. Yours sincerely,4 * Telephone No. : Whitehall 1234.

I do not see how we could accept the view that the anti gas measures necessary to enable the civil administration to be maintained is a defence charge; but need we really argue the point?

Satyamurti: Will Government be pleased to state: (a) whether their attention has been drawm to the statement sent bv Reuter, published in the Hindu, dated the 24th February, 1936 to the effect that the Government of India contributed £'4,000 towards expenditure on special measures in connection with- the Italo-Ethiopian dispute towards Aden; if so, what the purposes are; and (b) the reason why they agreed to make a contribution ? Sir Aubrey Metcalfe: (a) and (b). Yes. Until Aden is actually separated from India, the Government of India's responsibility for the welfare of the civil population of Aden Settlement must continue. They have, therefore, agreed to contribute half the cost of all measures which may have to be taken to protect that population in an emergency. It would not be in the public interest to publish the nature of those measures. Mr. S. Satyamurti: How was this cost of £4.000 arrived at? Sir Aubrey Metcalfe: It is a mere estimate which covers measures which mav have to be taken in certain emergencies. It is not a firm figure of expenditure. Mr. S. Satyamurti: Has any expenditure been sanctioned, or incurred, and if so, what is the amount sanctioned or incurred ? Sir Aubrey Metcalfe: I have just stated that it would not be in the public interest to publish the nature of those measures or their cost. I cannot give the information which the Honourable Member asks for without explaining what the measures are, and that I am not prepared to do. Mr. S. Satyamurti: L am not asking about the nature: I am simply asking about the cost, and how the figure was arrived at, whether the Government of India had any say in the matter and whether they have simply to foot the bill. Sir Aubrey Metcalfe: There is at present no bill to foot. As 1 explained, it is a mere estimate, and I cannot say what the eventual expenditure will be, if there will be any expenditure. Mr. S. Satyamurti: May I take it, therefore, that the Government of India have not incurred any expenditure under this head at all so far? Sir Aubrey Metcalfe: So far as I am aware, no actual expenditure has yet been incurred. Mr. S. Satyamurti: Have they incurred any liability? Sir Aubrey Metcalfe: I have already explained, as clearly as I can. that they have agreed to contribute half the cost of such measures as may be necessary. This is obviously a liability. Mr. S.

Treasury rather skate over the clear distinction between the purposes for which the 5,COO Service respirators will be used and those for which the 35,COO Civil pattern respirators were sent to Aden. It is, however, suggested that the cost of the 500 Service pattern respirators which the Resident has been authorised to unpack and use for training purposes (Colonial Office telegram of 21st February) is so small (£500) that it is undesirable to have a wrangle with the Treasury about it in view of the. fact that we have reached agreement with them on the general question of the cost of civil emergency measures at Aden. It is therefore suggested that we might accept their interpretation of the agreement reached on the main question on the understanding that we do not thereby prejudice consideration of the question of the incidence of the cost of the remaining Service pattern masks if these should have to be unpacked for use in earnest. The Treasury agreed orally at an interdepartmental meeting on this question on 13th November (P.Z.8287/35) that in the event of hostilities breaking out the whole question of the liability for expenditure connected therewith would require reconsideration. p P. /' ! 1440 1 1956^ \ A draft d.o. letter to Mr.Speed is submitted. co^cuX vv*.

Dear Clauson, Many thanks for your letter of the 2nd March (P.Z.1069/36). I think you may he under somemisappre hension regarding the purpose for which the 5,000 service pattern respirators were supplied to Aden. These respirators were not supplied for the uniformed services of the Crown, hut for those members of the public who were enrolled as essential squads in connection with the civil emergency measures. It does not seem to me, therefore, that the question of sharing the cost of these respirators is any different from the question of sharing the cost of respirators for other M. J. civilians. You may not he aware that it is not the intention that all the 5,000 service respirators should he used. We hope that not more than 10 per cent of them will he unpacked for training purposes and that the Clauson, Ssq. , India Office/ balanc e ENCLOSURE IN TfEEKtt LETTER NO. 15 9 APR 1936 FROM SECRETARY, POLITICAL AND SK$£T DEPT.

It is not clear whether the Government of India, despite the views of the Imperial Government, still regard the expenditure as Defence Expenditure, as indicated in their letter of 7th November 1935, in which case the payment would appropriately be shown in our accounts as an addition to the/ .the 'maximum” sum of £150,000 contributed tov/ards the defence of Aden, or whether it is to be treated as Civil expenditure to be met from amounts voted by the Legislative Assembly, In the latter event it will be necessary to inform India that the voted Savings in the Secretary of State’s grant for 1935/6 which have already been surrendered must be reduced accordingly.

As the sum involved is not large (it was estimated originally at £11,500, but it is understood that it is not now likely to be so large), and it is, of course, arguable that since the cost of the civil administration of Aden is borne entirely.by India the cost of safeguarding individual members of the civil population should also be a charge'on Indian Revenues^, it was thought desirable to consult the Government of India on the basis of the compromise which the Treasury suggested: viz. that the expenditure should be divided.

Dear Speed, • Would you kindly refer to your official letter of the 27th November, No.S.40178/2 and to our official reply which is issuing to-day? A point oi interpretation has arisen which it is perhaps unnecessary to deal with in our official letter. It should, however, be cleared up at this stage. You will remember that besides the 3 ^f ^000 civil pattern gas masks which have been supplied for Aden there are also 5,000 service pattern masks supplied for the use of personnel of the essential Services. We assume that the arrangements for the division of expenditure on civil emergency measures will only relate to the ^jTfOOO civil masks and not to the other 5,000, the cost of which seems nfirm that the Treasury agree with this terpretation in order that there should be no misunderstanding later on. properly to fall under defence expenditure.

S2GRET. QP 6214/27/36. Colonial Office, Downing Street, S.W.l, 10th February, 1936. 8 7 Dear Speed, We have just received a telegram from the Resident at Aden asking for certain additional anti-gas equipment and supplies. He says that a representative of the Chemical Defence Research Department of the War Office has recently visited Aden to give advice to the Royal Air Force, and he strongly recommends the supply of this additional material. The further supplies asked for are as follows 5,000 goggles: 20,000 2-oz. tins protective ointment: 150 tom bleaching poweder: 20 lbs. detecting paint: and protective caps and light overboots to approved scale for 560 police and 300 special constables. In view of this recommendation it seems clear that this additional equipment ought to be supplied, and if you agree, we propose to request the Air Ministry to obtain it and despatch it to Aden as soon as possible. As regards the cost, we have not asked the Air Ministry for an estimate, but this equipment will presumably fall into the same category as the other material which has recently been despatched to Aden, viz,, it will so far as possible remain unopened and unused save in so far as is necessary for practice purposes. Howard wrote to you on the 24th January as to the method of accounting for expenditure on these supplies, and you have said that we should only include in the supplementary estimate an amount sufficient to cover the supplies which are likely Actually to be used. It is not safe to assume that all this material will remain unopened and unused, and we havehave therefore included a sum of £500 in the supplementary estimate to cover payment to the Air Ministry for those supplies which are made use of. We have also just heard from the Resident at Aden that he proposes forthwith to equip the 560 police and the 90 employes of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company with service type respirators: and the Resident also asks that he should he given discretion tdmake further issues to selected essential personnel for preliminary training purposes. He says that it is urgently necessary to commence on a minimum of anti-gas training amongst civilian essential services and that he is advised that a hurriedly fitted respirator on an untrained man is practically useless. If you agree, we also propose to authorise the Resident to issue these respirators and to give him the discretion for which he asks. Provision for the purchase of these respirators has been made in the supplementary estimate. Yours sincerely, (Sgd) K.W. Blaxter. SPEED, ESQ,., M.C.0 Minute Paper. P.Z.8944/35 Department. L 3939 5000 7/35 Please see Minute at P.Z.8315/35. The question oi liability as between Indian and Imperial revenues ior the provision of anti-gas equipment at Aden was discussed at a meeting at the Treasury on 13th November (P.Z.8287/35). The Treasury declined to accept the view that the measures taken came under the head of ’defence’. It is evident that their attitude is dictated by a reluctance to prejudice their position regarding the issue of gas masks in the United Kingdom. It was agreed at the meeting that the Treasury would address the India Oilice officially on the subject. Treasury letter of 27th November (P.Z.8558/35) was subsequently received but was most unfortunately overlooked at the time and has only now come to light. ika. The Treasury offer to make as part of/general settlement of the expenditure arising out of the present state of emergency a contribution of half the cost of civil emergency measures at Aden. It will be observed that this offer appears to cover all civil measures rendered necessary by the emergency, and that it is restricted to the period of the present state of emergency. If a state of war should supervene, other considerations would arise and we would be justified in asking the Treasury to meet the whole cost of all civil measures rendered necessary by the war. Meanwhile we have received the Government of India’s letter of 7th November, (P.Z. 8444 / 35 J, agreeing Co5V ^ v/ith the view which we had put forward that the^ supply of anti-gas equipment should be considered as defence equipment. It might, hov/ever, be to their advantage to accept the present Treasury offer and thus secure the application of the same principle to other expenditure on/ non civil measures rendered necessary by the present state of emergency. For example, I understand from the colonial Office that medical stores for the civilian population at Aden to the value of about £1,000 have been supplied by the Government of India (P.Z.6627/35).

It is not clear from the Treasury letter whether their offer relates only to the 35,000 civil pattern masks or whether it includes also the 5,000 service pattern masks supplied for the use of personnel of the essential services. As regards the former, I agree that the Government of India might be given a lead towards acceptance of the Treasury offer, but as regards the latter I think there is a good case for inforriftgf that the expenditure on- thesis masks is Defence expenditure.

As a resuijt of that meeting, you wrote an ^ - official letter to thje India Office on the 27th November proposing that the‘^expenditure which had been incurred on anti-gas equipmerti^ for the civil population at Aden should be divided equally between His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. The expenditure on anti-gas equipment is, of course, much the largest item so far, but there has, as you know, been other emergency expenditure, and we assume that it is the Treasury intention to propose to the Government of India that all civil emergency expenditure at Aden should be divided equally between the two Governments. Your official letter of the 29'th November refers primarily to the anti-gas equipment. We have sent to you and to the India Office the correspondence which we have had with the Resident at Aden regarding emergency expenditure on other services than anti-gas measures - see the Resident’s despatch of the 8 th October, and his telegram No. 334 of the 30th October, 1935; our telegraphic reply of the 9th November; the S.B.B. SPEED, ESQ., M.C. Ithe Resident's telegram No. 366 of the 28th November: the Resident's telegram N 0 .UO 6 of the 31st December, and our reply of the 7th January. Will you be good enough to confirm that it is the intention of the Treasury that their proposal in regard to the anti-gas equipment should apply to all civil emergency expenditure at Aden? The suggested arrangement does not, of course, affect any a iditional political or military expenditure arising out of the present crisis.. (The additional military expenditure will no doubt be large).. The existing arrangement with the Government of India is that they pay a third of such expenditure with a maximum of £150,000 per annum. I am sending a copy of this letter to Rumbold at the India Office to whom perhaps you would send a copy of your answer.

Gentlemen, With reference to the letter from the Colonial Office of the 14th November, 1935, and previous corres pondence, regarding the provision of civil pattern respirators for the civil population of Aden, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Thomas to inform you that arrangements have been made for funds to be advanced by the India Office to meet the cost of these respirators in the first instance. A copy of a semi official letter which has been addressed to the India Office on the subject is enclosed, from which you will observe that a sum of £5000 will shortly be placed to your credit. 2. In addition to the civil pattern respirators which are being obtained by you, I am to explain that further supplies of anti-gas equipment are being furnished to Aden through the Air Ministry and War 0ffice : and it is proposed in due course to ask you to meet the charges for these supplies as well as the cost of the respirators. I am accordingly to ask that you will open a special Suspense Account to which any expenses in connection with the above supplies should be charged. Arrangements will be made to keep the account in credit as and when further funds are required. The account supported by vouchers, etc. , should be rendered monthly to the Colonial Office under secret cover to the Accountant. I am, etc., (Sgd.) V. H. BOYSE.

My dear Bumbold, With reference to your letter lo.P.Z.8689/35 of trie 4th December to Speed regarding the purchase of a further 15,000 civil pattern respirators for Aden, we think it is quite clear from our telegram to the Resident of the 28th September and his reply of the 30th September that he v/ishes to have 35,000 civil pattern respirators in addition to the 5,000 service type respirators for the essential civil services. We told him in our telegram of the 28th September that5,000 service type respirators were being sent to him, and went on to ask him how many civil pattern respirators he required in addition to the 20,000 originally mentioned. His reply was that he would like 35,000 civil pattern respirators. for the Colonies to order a further 15,000 civil pattern respirators for Aden.

Be do not thin* that there Is any use waiting longer before mafciag up our rsinds regarding the farther supply for ^den. The Xtalo—Sthioplah crisis shows no sign of being settled yet, end we have cows to the conclusion that we ought to place an order for a further 18,000 for Adea. There ' '**0 9 , . - * *There has been a little delay in dealing T/ith the first 20,000 since certain experiments haYe oeo/~-required to ensure that the containers are suitable for the hot climate of Aden. This fact also has, I believe, caused the cost of the respirator for Aden to increase somewhat and the figure now given is somewhere between 28«6d« and 5/- per respirator. Assuming the worst, viz. that the ultimate coot will be as much as 3/~ per respirator, the total cost of 35,000 would therefore be about ,05,250. It is true that the population in the Aden Settlement must be more dispersed than at Malta and that means of escape are easier, but on the other hand, in the case of an emergency Aden is to be an important centre for military and naval operations, the storage of vital supplies, wireless cacmmiiicatiana, etc., and that being so, the Aden Settlement would probably be subjected to intensive bombing at all points. Will you therefore kindly let rfje know whether the Treasury agree to the purchase of a further 15,000 respirators? The War Office are apparently piecing thethe contracts for the further Malta order on Thursday, and the Crown Agents would therefore like to know by Thursday morning whether we decide to hove a further consignment for Aden, The whole order can then be dealt with in one block. Perhaps, therefore, you can let us have a reply by to-morrow evening or fhorsda; morning. The telegrams in which we consulted the Resident regarding an increase frc*n 20,000 to 35,000 are telegram to the Resident of the 28th September and his reply of the 30th September. Copies of both these telegrams have been sent to the Treasury. I have sent a copy of this letter to Rumbold at the India Office and have asked him to let you know by *phone direct whether the India Office also consider that it is desirable that these further 15,000 respirators should be ordered.

Boyse has spoken to you about this and obtained your concurrence in our authorising the Resident to charge this expenditure to his Colonial Office Account. This is, of course, without prejudice to the final incidence of charge, but it was not necessary to say this to the Resident. You will see that we have authorised Reilly to incur small amounts on his own authority, but have told him that he should consult us before incurring any considerable expenditure. This follows generally the instructions v/hich we gave to the Resident during the hostilities between Saudi-Arabia and the Yemen. (See Woods’s letter to me of the 15th June, 1934). As to the final incidence of charge, perhaps this correspondence, as well as the cost of the gas equipment, ought to be discussed at the meeting to be held at the Treasury next Wednesday morning.

It was necessary, some weeks ago, to order in a hurry a certain amount of equipment for the defence of the civil population at Aden. This equipment is now about to be shipped and it is necessary that the 4 | manufacturers should be paid. The sum in question is about £11,500. ■ 2 . The Civil Administration of the Aden Settlement is the responsibility of the Government of India. The cost of the defence of Aden is met by H*M.G.$ India paying a contribution of £150,000 per annum or one-third, which ever is the less. As regards the incidence of the cost of this equipment the India Office have taken the view V that it should be treated as a defence measure. Owing, however, to the urgency of its despatch to Aden, we agreed reluctantly that the question of the incidence of its cost as between H.M.G. and Indian Revenues should be settled at a later date. The Treasury contenplate initiating discussions regarding the question of incidence next week. ' 3. The Treasury have explained that they are without funds with which to pay these bills. It is understood that the reasons for this are technic-al and are connected 5000 1 35 with the absence of an appropriate Vote and the ; P oss ihilities of queries by the Public Accounts Department if they charged it at this stage to another Vote. They have asked us as a matter of convenience to accept these bills as a temporary charge against Indian revenues and they undertake that our agreement to this suggestion would not be held to prejudice in any way a decision as to the l ultimate responsibility for payment.

Indeed, it seems doubtful whether the Treasury will contest very seriously our vieJ^that this is a Defence liability.

The orders have now been placed and the question of the paying of the bills arises. The Crown Agents, as you probably know, hold Maltese fund£, but do not do so in the case, of Aden. They are, therefore, without funds with which to pay the bills relating to the Aden respirators.

The meeting was called to discuss the incidence of cost of the emergency expenditure in certain Colonies and in the Settlement of Ade « 0 2o It was stated that the Treasury, while unable to accept the argument which had been advanced in respect of Malta and Aden that the cost of equipping civilians with gas masks and of other .civil emergency measures was an Imperial Defence liability, were -prepared, as part of the general emergency expenditure arising out of the Italo- Abyssinian dispute, to authorise some contribution in respect of those costs, having regard to the financial position of the territories concerned. 3 Any charge ultimately accepted against Imperial Votes would be borne on the Colonial and Middle Eastern Vote, and provision for the charge would form part of a Supplementary Estimate to be presented in February, 1936. It was agreed that:- an estimate of emergency expenditure to be incurred by the Civil Government up to the 31st March, 1936, in (a) Malt a The Colonial Office should obtain respectresji'ec'v o a : masks internment arrangements,, the gae school, ^ene i oerv.ce respirators drawn from War uffiee stocks^, eto and to submit this estimate to the Treasury * with ua estimate of : a te s financial position at the end of he?’ current financial year and of her estimates of reyenue and expenditure for the coming financial year.

Such waiver would no' involve a supplementary on the Colonial and Midd 1 e Ba .stern &gt;te „ fc' Scua] land. The Colonial Office should furnish an estimate f extra cost which should include cost incurred •r. behalf of Somaliland in Tanganyika in respect of re nf r cements.

The India Office representative was not able to undertake that the India Office would support those views in seeking the Government of India‘s agreement to the compromise suggested c 5, As regards the ownership of the civilian gas masks sent to Malta and Aden, it was urged on behalf of the Treasury that, if Imperial Votes pay for these gas masks, it vill be reasonable to require the return of the masks to this country if they are not used and if the emergency dies away. As to this the Colonial Office Representative pointed out that it is their policy to keep Malta in a state of preparedness not only in times of emergency but at all times, in view of her geographical position, but he agreed that, if it were decided that civilian requirements in this country were of greater urgency than civilian requirements in Malta, there would be a case for returning the gas masks. This matter was left over for discussion at a later date.

At that time the Resident at Aden had ^ ^ ^ a3ked for 20(000 further mask3 for sale t0 the rest of the civilian population. It was believed, however (&lt;/L&lt; •&gt; ^c&gt;Ui; f. ?.« that no cheap pattern respirators were available and we accepted the view that it was impossible to meet Sir B.Reilly’s request. It has since proved possible to start the manufacture of cheap civil type respirators, and- 20,000 for Aden and 100,000 for Malta of these are under urgent construction. The Colonial Office now seek our concurrence in a draft letter to the Treasury on this Question. We are concerned not only because the question of the incidence of cost is reserved, but also because of the political interest taken in India in the fate of Aden, and in particular in that of the substantial Indian minority there. The Colonial Secretary is anxious to authorise a free distribution of gas masks at Malta and Aden. The Treasury are apprehensive that free distribution in these colonies might prejudge the question whether there should be in an emergency a free issue of gas masks in this country. it is understood that this question of principle will shortly be brought before the Cabinet. In the meanwhile it is perhaps arguable that a decision regarding Aden and Malta does not necessarily prejudge the question of free issue throughout this country, because both Adenand Malta are fortresses and obviously dangerous places. Sir B.Reilly has asked that if a free issue is decided upon at Aden he should be sent 35,000 instead view that a free issue is desirable it would perhaps have been more satisfactory if we had had a recommendation from the Resident that this course should be followed. He was not, however, invited to ccmment on the principle involved in Colonial Office telegram No.75 of 28th September (in which our concurrence was not sought), and I understand the Colonial Office view to be that this is a question of high politics on which a local authority is not competent to judge. Sir B.Reilly has, however, not protested against a free distribution (which might ^ not be easy at Aden on account of the ignorance of the population and the difficulties of instruction). It is suggested that we should accept the Colonial Office view that a free distribution is desirable. May we concur in the Colonial Office draft to the Treasury subject to an addition suggested in pencil at the bottom of page 2 ? The object of this is to make it clear that we are not pressing our objection to the cost of gas masks for the civil population at Aden falling upon Indian Revenues in any way which would impede their despat ch. Tne Colonial Office are anxious to obtain our very early concurrence in their draft letter. Thie correspondence is not delaying the despatch of the gas of 20,000 masks. In considering the Colonial Office masks, which are in the process of being but if Treasury sanction is not obtained irocess of being made in any case, is not obtained by an early d&amp;te delay will ensue. jColonial Office, P^KJRET. -V Downing Street, S.W.l. Cr^ October, 1935. My dear Rurnbold, I have discussed with you on the telephone the question of the free issue of civil pattern respirators to the civil population at Aden, and I now enclose the draft of a letter which we are proposing to address to the Treasury, */a I The' question, you will remember, was discussed at the Emergency Expenditure Committee meeting at the Treasury on 27th September. Will you be good enough to let me Jmow whether the India Office concur in this draft? We have received a letter from Commander Hodsoll of the Air Raid Precuations Department, Home Office, in which he sets out at length the reasons why he thinks that a free issue of respirators is desirable. His letter was written with the position at Malta and in this country primarily in view, but much that hehe says applies equally to any other place. I am not delaying to have this letter copied as it is of considerable length, but if you feel that you would like to see all the arguments which he uses before agreeing to the draft to the Treasury, I will have a copy sent to you. In that event, perhaps you would let me know by ’phone. We are very anxious to get the letter off to the Treasury immediately, so should appreciate a very early reply. IVoo rec&amp;udb l£c vV r Yours sincerely,♦ / / THE SECRETARY, TREASURY. Dov/ning Street, October. 1935. SECRET. Sir, I am directed by Mr. Secretary MacDonald to request you to inform the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury that, in view of the present international situation, it has been necessary to accelerate measures for the protection of the civil population in Malta and Aden against an aerial gas attack. As a part of these preparations orders have been placed, after semi-official consultation with the Treasury, for the supply of respirators to the G-overnments of these Dependencies for issue to the local populations. It is proposed to issue these respirators free of charge to such of the population as are considered mr considered to require this type of protection. This proposal to make a free issue raises a point of principle to which this letter is directed: and Mr. MacDonald is anxious for two reasons to have their Lordships* concurrence in the action which he proposes to take:- (1) It is understood that it has not yet been decided upon what principle respirators should be issued to the civil population in this country, and a free issue in Malta and Aden may be held to affect this general question. (2) The cost of the passive defence of the civil population in Malta is, in Mr. MacDonald *3 view, a liability which should ultimately be borne upon Imperial funds: and this is a general issue U wj* L / . f ^ L ^ ^, y which he proposes in due course to take up separately with their Lordships. In the case of Aden, the Secretary of State for India has intimated that he regards the cost of protection of the population from air raids as a defence problem and therefore a charge upon Imperial k ,u %ti i. ! ' 1 ? ' I cr v V C \fiXvImperial funds, and not Government of India funds. Mr. MacDonald is disposed to accept this view, but he will address their Lordships further on the matter in due course77 issue is regarded as essential may be summarised briefly as follows. In the case of Malta a large proportion of the civil population lives in congested areas adjacent to the objectives against which enemy air attack would be likely to be directed. Malta is in fact a fortress and it is not possible to draw any clear line of demarcation between the military and civilian elements in the local defence problem. The proper protection of the population is called for, not only on humanitarian grounds, but in the interests of the efficient military defence of the Island. Mr. MacDonald has The grounds upon v/hich a free consultedconsulted the Air Raid Precautions Department of the Home Office and he is definitely advised that a free issue of respirators will be necessary to ensure efficient protection. In the case of Malta the population, particularly in the areas likely to be affected, consists almost entirely of poor people: and as a general rule families are large. If the supply of respirators is made dependent upon private purchase, it is considered that a large proportion of the population who are not sufiiciently educated to understand the implications of gas warfare would not provide themselves and their families with respirators. It is also at the present moment important from the military standpoint to maintain the morale of tne local population, and it is considered that the knowledge that respirators are to be issued not only to the local troops but also to the general population will have a salutary effect. It is hardly necessary to emphasise thethe importance of this point in the case of Malta in view of the proximity of the Island to Italy and its known indefensibility from air attack. While the situation at Aden is not in all respects comparable to that in Malta, generally similar considerations apply so far as the point of free issue is concerned. The population of Aden is mainly Arab. 3. Mr. MacDonald feels that His Majesty r s Government are clearly under an obligation to take all possible steps to place the population of both Malta and Aden in a state of preparedness: and so far as Aden is concerned, the Secretary of State for India has expressed his agreement with him. It would be a heavy responsibility in the light of the expert advice which has been given to defer any longer the decision to make a __ free■ L free issue of respirators: and Mr. MacDonald therefore trusts that he may he given an early intimation of their Lordships 1 concurrence. 4. For their Lordships’ information it may he added that as the Treasury are already semi-officially aware the preliminary order for respirators already placed is 100,000 for Malta and 20,000 for Aden. This order is for a cheap type of respirator costing, it is estimated, about 2/- each. The order has been placed by the Crown Agents for the Colonies on behalf of the two Governments concerned and the Crown Agents are acting in close co-operation with the Army Contracts Department. It is anticipated that further respirators will be required for both Dependencies, but it is not possible, in the case of Malta, to give a definite figure as to what the final requirements are likely to be until further informationIn order to provide the Acting Governor of Malta with the best available advice on the problem, a member of the staff of the Air Raid Precautions Department of the Home Office and the Assistant Superintendent of the Chemical Defence Research Department of the War Office have recently been sent to the Island. As soon as they have had time to examine the local situation and advise the Acting Governor, more precise information as to the dimensions of the problem will be available. In the case of Aden, the Resident has stated that if a free issue is made he desires to be supplied v/ith 35, 000 kl* 5. An early reply to this letter will be appreciated. I am, etc.COPY. / / HOME OFFICE, AIR RAID PRECAUTIONS DEPARTMEI'JT, 5, PRINCES STREET, ^ WESTMINSTER, ^00,275/1. LONDON, S.W.l. SECRET. 3rd October, 1935. My dear Dawe, I have just received a copy of telegram 109 dated October 2nd from Malta, which raises one or two points in regard to respirators. I have consulted with Mr. Johnson of the Chemical Defence Research Department who agrees with the suggestions I am making here in regard to the suggested answers to the telegram. Before I deal with these questions of detail, however, I should like to say that the most important point which arises is the one which we discussed the other day, namely as to whether there should be a free issue of respirators or not. as you know, I hold very strongly the view that the issue should be free, and my reasons for saying this may be summarised as follows:- (a) While the first line of defence against gas should be a protected room, and while everyone should be urged to make such provision and to go and stay in it in case of attack, there is always the possibility that the splinters or blast from high explosive bombs or the action of an incendiary bomb might damage the gasproofing and so let gas into the room, in which case the occupants would have no protection at all. Secondly, there must always be a number of people whowho may be caught out-of-doors, and if they had respirators with them they would at least be enabled to get under shelter somewhere quickly and probably with little damage; even if their clothes were contaminated, their lungs, eyes, nose and face would be protected and they could go somewhere quickly for treatment. (b) The possession of a respirator appears, therefore, to me to be essential as a second line of defence and to be used in accordance with the suggestions in (a) above. Naturally it must not be regarded as giving the wearer complete protection. It will give complete protection against any non-persistent gases for a short period but, in the face of a persistent gas, it will naturally only protect the face, eyes and lungs. It must, therefore, be made very plain that it is for emergency use only. These are what I might call my protective reasons, and, provided the population do as they are told, the provision of these two lines of defence ought to reduce the number of avoidable casualties to a very great extent. My next reasons are mainly of a psychological nature and they are as follows:- (c) The public will very naturally ask what is going to happen if their gasproof protection goes. If they are told that they must buy a respirator it means, in effect, that additional protection will be available to the rich and not to the poor. Even at 2/- there are certainly millions of people in this country. and there must be thousands in Malta, who could not afford to make this provision for themselvesand their families* The more numerous the family the less likelihood is there of the householder being able to afford to buy them respirators. A contingency of this kind will inevitably raise all sorts of most undesirable questions which I need hardly elaborate here* (d) I have a strong feeling that, apart from any other consideration, if an emergency arose the general public would demand that the Government should provide respirators* The demand might be wholly illogical but, in the stress of circumstances, that would have no effect. People swayed by panic or emotions are notoriously illogical* If this is so, and no provision had been made beforehand, the respirators would not be forthcoming and the results might be extraordinarily serious because, added to the general unpleasantness might be that of panic, riot, or grave disorder which might result in such protective instruc tions as had already been issued, i*e., to stay in a gasproof room, being entirely vitiated. This is particularly likely when one thinks that if gas comes pouring into the gasproof room, the whole instinct - and the perfectly right instinct - of the occupants is to rush out, and they will probably rush out into the street where it may be much worse. My last arguments are concerned really with the question of practicability. (e) In this country - although perhaps it may not be applicable to Malta which is facing a crisis - it is quite useless to go and issue respiratorsrespirators to everybody a long time in advance of any possible emergency. They would be put to all sorts of curious uses and when the time .t — came, half of them would be useless. Res pirators, if they are to last, particularly in a warm climate, want careful storage and looking after, and until a new means of storing which is now being developed is perfected, it would be, in my opinion, quite fatal to have them issued: even with this new system it would probably be unwise. (f) That being so, the only alternative is for the Government to store them in convenient depots so that they may be issued very rapidly if required. The idea of refusing to issue a respirator unless the applicant produced the necessary money seems to me hopeless and quite impracticable. The stores would probably be mobbed and I can see no escape from the con clusion that they would have to be issued free. There is also the question of training, that is to say, though not absolutely essential, it will be very much better if persons have worn the respirators and become accustomed to the feel of them, and so on. In this country we are faced with the difficulty that the Government will be accused of war drill if any compulsory training of the population is instituted; at least, that is the position at present. I am going to propose in due course, therefore, that there should which be depots about the country/will be open and to which anybody who wants to may go and wear a respirator and have a little voluntary training. In Malta the situationsituation is probably different and in that case some arrangements ought to be made whereby people who will be supplied with respirators have a chance to put them on to see what they feel like, though I personally should rather deprecate the idea of making an issue a t the present time to the public unless the emergency is considered to be really imminent. So much for my general comments. As regards the details of the telegram, I would suggest to you, first of all, that the firm which is getting orders for an expensive respirator ought to be given a hint that in any case a large supply of a cheap type of respirator will be made available to Malta, and I think also that the Governor ought to make some announcement to the effect that this Government supply is being made available. I think he could do this without in any way committing himself on the question of finance at the present stage. It is purely a question of wording, but I do not think it is fair, either to the manufacturers concerned or to the public in Malta, to leave them in ignorance of the fact that a very much cheaper, and possibly as efficient, article will be made available very shortly. As regards children under the age of five, the Governor should, I think, be informed that no individual protective arrangements are available for children under this age at present and that their protection must be on a collective basis. Since they will not have any individual protection it is, therefore, very important that arrangements are made to store babies in substantial buildings or underground shelters in which the risk of the gasproofing becoming damaged is as small as possible. I am sorry to be so long-winded but I thought perhaps it might help if I set out my views at some length. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) E. c, Hodsoll. A.

The Chairman explained the circumstances in which it had been thought desirable that this matter should come before the Committee. He thought that the most convenient course would be for the Colonial Office representative to explain how matters stood in regard to Malta. vulnerable to air attack. The Secretary of State had decided that every measure should be taken which expert opinion recommended as a protection against air attacks, and he now learned that this involved the provision of cheap respirators for the civil population, in addition to the provision of gas- proofed rooms etc. He had, therefore, informed the Malta Government that an order for 100,000 respirators was being placed. Mr. Dawe understood that the Treasury were with the Colonial Office in this action, inasmuch as they had given semi-official sanction for the dispatch to Malta of a number of masks of a dearer kind, for the use of the civil population, at a time when these were the only tvr&gt;e available. Mr. Bridges agreed that this was so, subject to the proviso that the question of the incidence of charge had been reserved. and minimum one: an expert from the a. R,p. Department was now on his way out to Malta, and woulc shortly advise on the actual number required, which would certainly exceed 100,000; the population of Malta was 050,000, though not all of these would require respirators. Mr. Dawe said that Malta was particular!. The number of 100,000 was an arbitraryIt was agreed that the Crown Agents for the Colonies should be responsible for ordering the respirators. The order would‘actually be placed by the War Office and the asseiably work carried out in the factory at Leyland which manufactured for the War Office. At the moment the War Office was the only Department in a position to place the orders; but they would act in this matter as agents of the Crown Agents, who would pay the bills. The question of the ultimate incidence of charge would be reserved for further consideration. Mr. Watherston explained that respirators of the civil type were hardly out of the experimental stage; .some of the firms who would have to supply them were not on the War Office regular lists, and it would be necessary to resort to single tenders; but if, as he understood, early delivery was the important thing and formalities were to be waived, the offers at present before them showed that 100,000 respirators could be delivered in 3 or 4 weeks. The next question before the Committee was whether or not the masks should be distributed free. Mr. Bridges said that he understood that the Colonial 0ifice were anxious to distribute them free of charge at Malta, bat that the Resident at Aden had suggested making a charge for them. The Treasury were concerned in tw^o ways: first, if the respirators were distributed free, the Treasury might in the end be asked to foot the bill; and, secondly, there were the possible repercussions of any action taken now on the distribution of civilian respirators in England. Mr. Blaxter explained that the Resident at Aden had asked for 20,000 masks to be sold to the civil population; but the Secretary of State had said that it was impossible to treat Malta and Aien differently, andf that if the one got the masks free of charge &gt; so must the other. Mr. Bumbold said that the question of free distribution at Aden had not been considered as yet at the India Office, and he had no instructions; but he suggested that there was no need to impose free distri bution on the Resident if he did not want it. Mr. Blaxter suggested that the Resident should be informed of the possibility that there might be a free distribution of respirators, and asked whether in view of that fact he wanted to revise his requisition 1 ; but that he should not on that account keep any more people than was absolutely necessary in the congested area. This course was agreed to. the Colonial Office pressed for free distribution. Colonel Hutton pointed out that, if it was desired not to prejudice the larger issue of the supply of respirators in the United Kingdom, a free distribution at Malta and sAen could be based on tne fact that the latter two places were fortresses. question was of such difficulty and importance, owing to its repercussions, that it ougnt to go before Ministers It v;as, however, of the utmost importance not to be caught in an emergency without the necessary masks. He therefore suggested that the Committee should agree that an order for tne proper number of masks should be placed; the question of incidence being reserved. The masks should be or iered by the T vVar Office on behalf of the Crown agents; and the Colonial and India Offices should address the Treasury in writing, as soon as possible, on the question of free distribution; it In further discussion, the representatives of Sir Richard Hopkins said that the whole -3-would be an advantage to the Treasury to have their considered views, and there would be time to obtain a decision while the masks were being made. This course was agreed to. Wing Commander Hodsoll added that he would hasten the production of the memorandum which was being prepared for presentation to the Cabinet on the general question of the supply of respirators at home. It was suggested that a larger order than 120 , 000 , the number so far envisaged, should be placed, as it was generally admitted that more would eventually be required; Wing Commander Hodsoll thought that Malta and ^.den between them would absorb some 200,000. It was agreed that the Colonial Office should consider tne matter and inform the War Office, who could not place an order without a definite undertaking from the Crown agents to take the whole amount up. The Committee would be prepared to authorise an order up to 200,000 at this stage if the Colonial Office regarded this number as necessary. Wing Commander Hodsoll confirmed that the supply of civilian type respirators at Malta would release many of the Service type which were at present in store at Malta for use elsewhere, as the War Office desired. arrangements to that effect were already being made. He also said that there was some talk of gas masks being required for the civilian population in Egypt. He assumed, and the Committee agreed, that in that case repayment from the Egyptian Government would be required, and they could make their own arrangements about distribution. The masks for Malta and Aden would in any case take priority over any order for Egypt. He undertook to find out from the Foreign Office whether the Egyptian Government wanted any respirators, and if so, how many.© I P 7,. 36366/^.9. t ^1935# Sir, fith refer^nou to jour Xottor 6214/27/Z&amp; of the 21«t Inotont, I aw eo^raandoo by tha Air Council to acquaint you, for t&amp;c Information of the Secretary of State for tha Colonies, that tha raqul ram ante in antl*gaa material reported by the heeldant at Aden ware discussed at tha meeting of tha Inter-Departmental Committee which waa held at the far Office yesterday. 2« It la underatcod that tha iar Office are arranging for tha immediate transfer of S000 Service type reaplratore with type 'p* container* from Malta to Aden for the protection of assentlei civil services.

Sir, With reference to the letter from this Department of the 4th September and your reply No. S.36111/S.6 of the 10th September regarding the defence of the civil population at Aden against a possible gas attack in the event of hostilities between this country and Italy, I am directed by Mr. Secretary MacDonald to transmit to you, to be laid before the Air Council, a copy of a telegram which has been received from the Resident at Aden on this subject. Copies of a further telegram from the Resident enquiring the probable date of despatch of the gas masks and of the reply which has been sent are also enclosed. 2. It will be seen that the Resident asks for the supply of 5,000 gas masks for the protection of the essential civil services, and also asks whether at least a further 20,000 masks can be supplied for sale to members of the civil population. 3 THE SECRETARY, AIR MINISTRY.r 3. The Secretary of State, and the Secretary of State for India (who has also 'been consulted) agree that it is desirable that 5,000 masks should he despatched at the earliest possible moment to Aden for the protection of the essential civil services, and also that the decontamination equipment asked for should be supplied, subject to the Air Council being satisfied that the amounts asked for are reasonable, and subject, of course, to supplies being available. It is hoped that if the demand cannot be met in full, a substantial part, at any rate, can be met. 4. I am accordingly to request that the Air Council will be good enough to make arrangements for the despatch of the gas masks and equipment to the Resident at Aden as soon as possible. The Secretary of State feels strongly that it is desirable that both gas masks and equipment should be despatched not later than next week, and he requests that he may be informed on what date despatch will take place in order that the Resident may t&gt;e informed of the date of arrival. 5.5 It is understood that it will not toe possitole to supply at once the 20,000 gas masks, civil pattern, as supplies are not available, tout this point is toeing taken up with the Air Raid Precaution Department. 6 .

As a result of an inter-departmental meeting ^ Colonial Office telegram No.60 of 5th September was despatched to the Acting Resident at Aden consulting him on the matter. In his reply of 11th September he asks for 5,000 gas masks and a certain amount of other material for the essential services. As regards the rest of the civil population he does not think it essential to provide them with gas masks, but asks for 20,000 further masks which he could put on sale. 2. The Colonial Office comments are in Mr.Blaxter’s letter of 18th September. 3. It is obvious that the Acting Resident's requests in respect of the essential services must be met, and it is clearly impossible to do anything for the present for the rest of the civil population. 4. It is submitted that we may concur in the Colonial Office proposals, the question of the incidence of cost between H.M.G. and Indian Revenues being reserved for subsequent discussion. This question of incidence is discussed in the minutes flagged A,(see in particular f or my minute of 13th September^ It is difficult to OV\ estimate what the contingent liability o-f Indian Revenues jwould be.

We can say, however, that the War Office has been asked, through the Air Ministry, to supply the 5,000 gas masks for essential services and the anti-gas stores, though it is quite possible that the War Office may have to cut down some of the latter owing to shortage of StOCK. We have spoken to the Treasury, who will raise no objection in principle to the supply of the 5,000 respirators and anti—gas stores, if you agree that the number is reasonable, subject to later settlement of the Question of incidence of cost as between His Majesty's Government and Indian funds. The Resident will be asked not to unpack the gas masks unless it is necessary to do so, as, if not eventually required, they can be returned to the. War Office without charge. - V -v&gt;V II shall he glad if you will kindly let me know at the earliest possible moment whether you agree to action being taken accordingly.

As you know, the administration of the Aden Settlement is the responsibility of the Government of India. The responsibility for the conduct of political affairs, and for the defence of Aden is the responsibility of His Majesty’s Government. The Departments of His Majesty's Government maintain that the provision of gas masks and decontamination equipment for the civil population of the Settlement (even for essential services) is a civil responsibility, and they seek to draw an analogy from the- fact that in this country the Home Office Vote bears the cost of such measures in Great Britain and that it is regarded as a civil liability in Malta. I think that the arguments which could be used against this contention are:(l) Under modern conaitions of warfare the defence of the civil population against M attack is as much a part of defence as is the defence of the territory in which they reside. This is especially true of a fortress such as Aden. Any analogy between Aden and Great Britain is quite false, because in the case of Great Britain the money comes out of the same till in any case, while in the case of Malta presumably the Maltese are not strong enough to stand up for themselves against the Treasury. India is. (2) The point you make about3436 b 5000 135 At Minute Paper Department. ■vj* X Qie.c&lt;v.vA*e \»5 ^ v O' a '‘ &lt;f^ Q&amp;. R6q-v c &lt;i &lt;5 y&gt;\ftc£ NoC.

If, however, we are pressed strongly in the matter, I am inclined to think that we should suggest to the Government of India that a compromise might be reached on the basis of His Majesty’s Government paying for the X &lt; essential services, and the Government of India meeting the cost of any measures necessary for the protection of the remainder of the civil population. At the inter-Departmental meeting to discuss the question of the provision of protective measures at Aden, the Imperial Departments strongly took the view that it was urgent that the necessary measures should be put in train without delay and if this was to be done it was impossible to settle beforehand the question of financial liability. The India Office representatives therefore ie*c. ^ ^ acquiesced in this question^being Referred for further discussion. I am, however, inclined to think that it would be desirable for Council sanction to be obtained for our adherence to this attitude. It does open up the possibility of Indian revenues eventually meeting at least some/cost of the measures which have been taken. It is unfortunately impossible to make any estimate of the liability which we may be incurring. This will probably depend on whether the equipment being sent to Aden is, in fact, used. AX Political Secretary . I suggest that this matter now has passed beyond the competence of the Military Department. It was originally passed to me by Mr.Walton as being a defence matter.At the time it seemed as if it were, more .x \ particularly as it appeared that the question was mainly one of ensuring maintenance of the essential services of the fortress. This aspect prevailed when the Colonial Office, in conjunction with the Air Ministry, undertook to arrange provision/, although as yet they have not .specifically accepted responsibility for cost. There remains provision for the rest of the civil population, the cost of which I agree might perhaps be accepted as a charge on the Government of India, but not as a defence measure. Hence I ask if you will accept transfer of the case. Regarding your last point, even if the stores are not used they are likely to depreciate rapidly and so be worth very little after staying any length of time in Aden.

Air Ministry and Colonial Office were present* The gestural eoaelusloas arrived at as a result of the discussion at that meeting are suamcrlsed in the following paragraphs of this letter. 2# It was explained by the Air Ministry representative that arranteaents had already been made for * h# iasue of gas assJts to all the military personae! in Aden, includin' the Arab Levies, while a supply of bleaching powder for decontamination had also been sent. In addition, special arrangements had been made to strn^the. the ioc~.i de^eiieea by sending the necessary ersonnel to nan the four anti-aircraft guns at Aden. steps were necessary In order to provide protection for thore neabers of time olvll poxmlation employed on the essential sdminlstmtive services connected with the aettlcnr^t - e«g. the adnlsistrstive personnel, the police, aud lebour employed by the electric power station, the posts and telegraphs service, and by the dockyard and It was agreed la discussion tnst sons further harbour THE SBBrfKFAftT, AlH MI:»IhTRT&lt;harfcoxir firma* (It waa pointed out t *at t in the ceae of i£alt&amp;f aetlo 4 had already been ta-:ui to supply gas masks* to the number of 70 9 JJ0 9 to give similar protection to members of the civil population employed in the rt vital sector”.) It was thought that it wo’ild not be practicable to attempt to provide, protection for ths whole of the ordinary civil population of Aden,and that it wee probable that* if an air attact was threatened* muoh of that population would diaperae into the Protectorate and so be out of da *ger* Ho agreement was found to be possible at the meeting on the question of whether ultimate responsibility for taking the measures coaaidex**! necessary rested with ths Government of India or with His Majesty e Government in the United Kingdom| but it was considered that, in order that action should be taken at the earliest possible moment# the necessary steps for the aupply of the equipment requiied should be made by the Air Ministry forthwith,the question of whether the coat of those measure© should be borne by the Government of India or by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom being left over for later settlement. It was thought that it would be advisable, In the first instance, for a telegram to be sent to tne Acting Resident, asking him to give an estimate of how many gas masts would be required, on the basis mentioned above, ths opportunity being taken to explain to him what measures had been put into effect as regards the protection of a part of the civil population of Malta. If* ae the secretary of State hopes, the Air Council agree that action s iould be taker* forthwith by the Air Ministry on the lines indicated,arrangements willwill no doubt be made for Immediate semi-official consultation with a view to the despatch of the necessary telegram to the Acting Resident. 3. Opportunity was taken at the same time to discuss the question of whether any special action, similar to that contemplated in the case of Aden, was required as regards any townships in British Somaliland or Kenya. (a) As regards British Somaliland, it was pointed out that, while an Italian air attack on either Berbera or Burao was possible (especially on the latter, in view of the presence there of a part of the Camel Corps), it was unlikely that the Italians would use gas on such a scale as to make it necessary to take any special measures with a view to the provision of gas masks either to the Camel Corps or to members of the civil population. It was felt that the Italians were more likely to concentrate their efforts on attacking Aden, as being a place of infinitely greater importance, both from the point of trade and prestige,than either Berbers or Burao. At the same time, the Tar Office representative stated that he would wish to consider further the .. question of whether it might not be well to make a sappiy 01 gas mas is available for issue to the Camel Corps if required. (t), As egards Kenya* it was pointed out by the Air Ministry representative that both Nairobi and Mombasa are at present beyond the effective bombing range of any Italian aircraft in Italian Somaliland, and that, therefore, no immediate action was necessary. At the same time, it was pointed out that it was possible that, if the Italians sent out new aircraft to Italian Somaliland (as it was believed that they were contemplating doing), and if new aerodromes/ aerodromes were oon.tructed ia the south of Jtallaa SOMllload. tnen «.lrobl sad hoabe.a would be brought wit ia faotiwa bo lag Mage, sad action Might beooae necessary. »• Air Ministry reyreaeatstlM uadertoolt that the position woul be watched in the , ir i:iai8try with a view t0 b&lt;,ln * ^tisted, should crexteatsace. require it. » 01 ' i ie letter ere being sent to the foreign .fflcc, the India Office, the far Office end the Admiralty.

However, after a certain amount of discussion this afternoon, Aden being regarded as a fortress and link in Imperial Communications, the protection of the population was, more or less, regarded by those present as a matter of Defence. So, now, the Colonial Office, formally, are asking the Air Ministry to invite the Resident to say what he considers are the main needs, giving him, as a Colonel A*E* BarstO'?, M.G., line c/g Colonel R.J.B.

If the Sub-Committee recommend the institution of protective measures arrangements for the supply of gas masks, etc. can be completed at short notice provided the type of mask now being made under Home Office arrangements is considered adequate, and subject to the satisfactory settlement of the incidence of cost. 4.
