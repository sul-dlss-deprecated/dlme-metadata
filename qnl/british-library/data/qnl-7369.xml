Colonial Office, August, 1928. b3 Report by Sir Gilbert Clayton, K.C.M.G., K.B.E., C.B., on his Mission to the King of the Hejaz and of Najd and its Dependencies for the purpose of negotiating a settlement of outstanding questions (April—June, 1928). Sir Gilbert Clayton to the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies. 10th July, 1928. Sir, I have the honour to refer to Colonial Office letter No. 59092/28 of the 17th April, 1928,* relating to the negotiations which I was appointed to conduct with His Majesty the King of the Hejaz and of Najd and its Dependencies, and to submit my report on the progress and the results of my mission. 2. I left London on the 19th April, accompanied by Flight- Lieutenant G. M. Moore, M.C., and arrived in Alexandria on the 24th April. I was met by Mr. G. Antonius, C.B.E., Assistant Secretary to the Palestine Government, and proceeded on the same day to Cairo, where I was met by Mr. B. H. Bourdillon, C.M.G., Counsellor to the Residency in Baghdad, Mr. K. Cornwallis, C.M.G., C.B.E., D.S.O., Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior in 'Iraq, and Captain J. B. Glubb, O.B.E., M.C., Administrative Inspector in the 'Iraq Government Service. 3. I spent two days in Cairo, during which I had the advantage of conversation with Lord Lloyd, and also with Mr. Bourdillon, who had been specially deputed by the High Commissioner for 'Iraq to acquaint me more fully with his views on the subject-matter of the negotiations. Mr. Bourdillon left for Baghdad on the 26th April, and on the same day I left for Port Said with Captain Glubb and Flight-Lieutenant Moore, and embarked on the s.s. ' Chindwin ' for Port Sudan. Mr. Cornwallis and Mr. Antonius joined the ' Chindwin ' at Suez, as did also Mr. A. Antippa, of the Palestine Service, who had been lent as stenographer to the Mission. 4. The Mission reached Port Sudan on the afternoon of the 30th April, and sailed at noon on the following day on board H.M.S. ' Dahlia ' (Commander H. Cotton, R.N.), arriving at Jedda at 10 a.m. on the 2nd May. On arrival I was informed that the King had been delayed in Buraida and could not reach Jedda till * See Appendix, page 84. (13548 C) Pk. 168 125 8,23 Hw. (Gp.311) B2the end of that week. His Majesty passed through Jedda on the 5th May on his way to Mecca, where he had to pay the customary ritual visit, and returned to Jedda on the morning of the 7th. At 10.30 a.m. on that day he received me with the other members of the Mission in formal audience, and it was then arranged that negotiations should be opened on the following day. 5. Accordingly, the first meeting took place at 8 a.m. on Tuesday, the 8th May. Negotiations were formally opened at that meeting and continued with little intermission until Sunday, the 20th May. Twelve meetings were held, at which both His Majesty and myself were present, and a detailed summary of the conversations will be found in the enclosed Record of Proceedings (Annexure 1*). Concurrently with my conversations with the King, Mr. Cornwallis held a series of meetings in committee with His Majesty's advisers [see enclosed memorandum and minutes, Annexure 2t), at which the subsidiary questions affecting 'Iraq were discussed. As soon as these were over, a further series of meetings were held by i r. Antonius in committee with the King's advisers, at which questions affecting Trans-Jordan were dealt with (see enclosed memorandum, Annexure 3|). S; P 1 ® fil ' st Question which came up for discussion was, naturally, that of the desert posts and the incidents connected therewith. The King seized the earliest opportunity of defining his attitude ; and frorn that attitude, as defined by him at our first meeting, he never receded. The deadlock to which our conversations carried us mav be said virtually to have been reached at the end of the second meeting, when I had communicated to him the views of His Majestv's Government. My first task in this Report will be to set forth as rieny as possible, the main points of the attitude taken up bv the King together with an outline of the course which I adopted to meet his arguments. 7. It will be remembered that the immediate cause of the present dispute was the construction by the 'Iraq Government of a post at usaiya, which is a water-point in the desert, at a distance of some 75 miles from the Iraq-Najd frontier, and 55 miles from the nearest point m the neutral zone. On various grounds the King objected to the construction of that post, and in support of his objection invoked Article 3 of the first Protocol of Uqair, which reads as follows :— 'The two Governments mutually agree not to use the watering-places and wells situated in the vicinitv of the border for any military purpose, such as building forts on them, and not to concentrate troops in their vicinity.' The 'Iraq Government, on the other hand, rejected Ibn Sa'ud's contention, and held that the above clause could not by any reasonable interpretation be regarded as applying to Busaiya. * Page 17. f Page 43. + Page 63.5 8. In order fully to appreciate the King's attitude on this point, it will be necessary to relate his version of the circumstances in which the first Protocol of Uqair was drawn up. This Protocol was signed at Uqair on the 2nd December, 1922, as an appendix to the Muham- mara Convention of May, 1922, in which provision was made for the fixing of a frontier between 'Iraq and Najd. Ibn Sa'ud alleges that his delegates at Muhammara had signed the Convention in error ; that he (Ibn Sa'ud) had steadfastly refused to ratify it on the ground that a hard-and-fast frontier in mid-desert would be contrary to all the established usages of nomadic life ; that he had repeatedly pointed out at the time that such a frontier, with its inevitable corollaries in the form of posts and fortifications in the open desert, would be repugnant to his tribes ; and that he had finally given his assent only when Sir Percy Cox had offered, six months later at Uqair, to insert a clause containing such guarantees as would meet his essential objections. Thus it was, according to Ibn Sa'ud, that Article 3 of the Protocol of Uqair come into being. He maintains that it was only because of his firm belief that that Article was intended to prevent the erection of posts anywhere in the open desert on either side of the border, that he consented to accept the frontier and ratify the Convention. 9. I took the line that His Majesty's Government did not accept, and could not admit, his interpretation of Article 3 of the Uqair Protocol; that they regarded the distance of Busaiya from the frontier to be such that it could not reasonably be held to lie ' in the vicinity of the frontier ' ; and that they were bound to uphold the principle that the 'Iraq Government, as well as the Najd Govern ment, were at liberty to take such administrative measures within their own territory as seemed to them necessary for the better super vision of the desert. Throughout the conversations, I abstained from embarking too far upon a discussion of the merits or demerits of the posts at Busaiya and elsewhere. I preferred to take my stand on the unassailable ground of a fixed principle, namely, that, in the absence of any specific undertaking to the contrary, the sovereign right of each Government to take such internal measures as it thought necessary was one which His Majesty's Government were determined to uphold. 10. Eventually, I came to the conclusion that not only was Ibn Sa'ud unwilling on the ground of general policy to give way on the question of the posts, but also that he was precluded from doing so by the attitude of his people. I used every means of persuasion and pressure at my disposal, and when these failed I decided to recommend, as an alternative to rupture, that the negotiations be suspended. The advent of the pilgrimage celebrations which were requiring the King's presence at Mecca for over a month made it necessary to bring our conversations to a close in any case. Ibn Sa'ud accepted my suggestion, and he also agreed to a formal exchange of letters {see Annexure 4*), in which a peaceful modus vivendi was * Page 66. (13548 C) b 36 laid down between 'Iraq and Najd for the duration of the period of suspension. He insisted, however, on one stipulation, namely, that in view of the fact that he had to return to Najd by the middle of August, and that he was pledged to communicate the result of his negotiations to his people on his return, our conversations would have to be resumed or definitely broken off by that date. 11. Before a decision can be reached as to whether or not con versations should be resumed, due consideration should be given to the three points put forward by Ibn Sa'ud as a basis for a settlement. The first relates to the posts themselves. To the last, Ibn Sa'ud maintained that the demolition of the posts at Busaiya, Salman and Shabicha, and the withdrawal of their garrisons were a sine qua non for the restoration of peace on the border. He argued that the habits and the mentality of the nomad tribes were such that the erection of a post at a water-point in the desert, even if built for peaceful purposes, was equivalent in their minds to a denial, or at any rate a serious restriction, of access to the water. He gave me to understand in the most friendly but explicit terms that, if the posts were maintained, he would have to decline all responsibilitv for the maintenance of peace. His tone was never offensive or minatory, but was consistently firm. He kept repeating that it was precisely the question of desert fortifications which had dictated his refusal to ratify the Muhammara Convention, until Sir Percy Cox had offered him a guarantee against the construction of posts in the desert. He stated on more than one occasion that if doubt were cast on the validity of his interpretation of Article 3 of the Protocol of Uqair, he would beg His Majesty's Government to search among their records of what took place at the Conference of Uqair, in order to verify the accuracy of his contention. He declared that he, for his part, was prepared to offer his records for inspection. 12. The second relates to the incursions into Najd of cars and aeroplanes from 'Iraq. The King contended that the mere crossing of the frontier by forces from Iraq was a breach of his sovereignty as recognised in the Treaty of Jedda, and a violation of Article 6 of the Bahra Agreement* He argued that the action of the cars and aeroplanes had so inflamed his people that even those whom he had detailed to punish the authors of the attack on Busaiya had turned on him and loudly demanded reprisals. It was then, and only then, that a movement began which led to the concentration of some 60,000 men from all tribes, even the most law-abiding, for a retaliatory attack on 'Iraq, which only with the greatest trouble he had succeeded in preventing. He demanded an explicit assurance in writing from His Majesty's Government to the effect that Article 6 included Imperial as well as 'Iraqi forces. * Article 6 of the Bahra Agreement reads : ' The forces of ' Iraq and Naid may not cross the common frontier in the pursuit of offenders except with the consent of both Governments.'7 13. The third relates to the question of the surrender of fugitives from justice. Ibn Sa'ud holds that discipline cannot be effectively enforced in the open desert so long as culprits are at liberty to cross the frontier and take refuge in an adjoining territory where his forces are precluded (by Article 6 of the Bahra Agreement) from pursuing them. He had always felt, and now more than ever, that it was essential for the proper enforcement of discipline that the Govern ments of 'Iraq and Najd should mutually undertake to surrender fugitives from justice, and he pressed that an agreement to that effect should be the condition of any settlement. 14. I am unable to tell with any certainty to what extent Ibn Sa'ud's account of the origin of Article 3 tallies with the facts. His version of what had taken place at Uqair was detailed and circumstantial, and left me with the impression that he may have genuinely understood the provisions of Article 3 to entail a wider application than is warranted by the facts. On the other hand it may be that his version is only in part correct, and that, being made wise by recent events on the frontier, he has amplified it in an endeavour to strengthen his case before His Majesty's Government and his position towards his own people. 15. On one point, however, Ibn Sa'ud appears to have some justification for his somewhat sweeping interpretation of the phrase ' in the vicinity of the frontier. In the Arabic text the correspond ing phrase is ala atraf al-hudud, and I am informed on reliable authority that this Arabic expression is capable of a wider applica tion than its English counterpart. A la atraf means literally '' on the sides of ' or ' at the extremities of ' ; and I am credibly informed that, to the Arab reader who has no English, the phrase might and probably would convey a wider connotation than can reasonably be read into the English phrase. It should be noted, moreover, that no provision is made in the Muhammara Convention or in either of the'two Protocols for priority to be given to the English text, in cases of divergence between the English and the Arabic versions. 16. My own conclusions are that, whatever justification Ibn Sa ud may have for insisting on his interpretation of Article 3, it is never theless essential that the principle to which I have referred in para graph 9 above should be upheld. I am not convinced that the permanent security of the south-western confines of 'Iraq can best be ensured by a chain of far-flung posts in the open desert or that the task of defending 'Iraq will eventually be most easily and economically performed by the construction of a system of posts, the mere presence of which is bound to give rise to effervescence in Najd. The fact cannot be overlooked that, ever since the conclusion of the Bahra Agreement in November, 1925, there has been a remarkable absence of raids from Najd into Iraq, and that it was precisely the construction of the post at Busaiya that excited the Najd tribes to break the peace. Nevertheless, I have no doubt that, (13548 C) b49 20. I have hitherto confined myself to those representations of Ibn Sa'ud which relate to Article 3 of the Protocol of Uqair. There were two other points which he put forward as being essential to any- lasting settlement, and to which I have already referred in para graphs 12 and 13 above. The first, which relates to the definition of Article 6 of the Bahra Agreement, presents no difficulty. It was generally understood, at the time of the conclusion of the Bahra Agreement, that the term ' forces ' which occurs in Article 6 applied to all the regular forces of either Government. Ibn Sa'ud's request for an assurance that the term must be held, as far as 'Iraq is con cerned, to include Imperial as well as 'Iraqi forces is, therefore, a proper one. But I venture to recommend, since the question has arisen in this form, that the opportunity be seized of obtaining a similar assurance on Ibn Sa'ud's part as to the precise meaning of the term when applied to the forces of Najd. It is a matter of common knowledge that Ibn Sa'ud does not maintain a regular standing army, and that he relies, for the purposes of military action, on the armed contingents of Ikhwan which his tribes are able from time to time to supply. I think it advisable, in order to preclude the possibility of equivocation on his part in the future, to obtain from him an acceptable definition of what must be held to constitute the ' forces ' of Najd, similar to that which he asks for from 'Iraq. 21. A clear understanding on this point is the more desirable in view of the attitude which I took up when replying to Ibn Sa'ud's protest against the violation of his frontier by aeroplanes and armoured cars. In this connection, I refused to recognise the affair at Busaiya as a raid within the meaning of the Bahra Agreement, but maintained that it was a premeditated attack by armed tribesmen who belonged to the very elements which constituted the fighting forces of Najd, on an official post within the territory of a friendly State; and that this attack amounted in itself to a violation of the provisions of Article 6 of the Bahra Agreement, and had led to a situation in which His Majesty's Government were forced to take adequate measures for the defence of 'Iraq. 22. The other point {see paragraph 13 above) relates to the sur render of refugee offenders. This is not a new theme, and reference to my Report* on the negotiations at Bahra will show that Ibn Sa'ud's request had been rejected in deference to the views of the 'Iraq Government. I have been given to understand, however, that the 'Iraq Government would be willing to reconsider their attitude on this matter. 23. The exchange of notes laying down the agreed terms of suspension of conversations was nearly prevented by an unfortunate development four days previous to my departure. Draft notes had been agreed upon in conversation, and Ibn Sa'ud had left for Mecca, but before they could be officially exchanged I received an indignant * Middle East, No. 7.10 letter from Ibn Sa'ud, dated the 22nd May, supplemented by a verbal statement conveyed to me by his advisers. The gist of these communications was to the effect that Ibn Sa'ud had just received a detailed and circumstantial report informing him that on the 25th or 26th April eight armoured cars had visited Aiwij and tried to persuade tribes to migrate into 'Iraq ; that a few days later three aeroplanes had flown over Lina and dropped bombs ; and that on or about the same date other aeroplanes had flown over the Bashuk area. 24. Ibn Sa'ud's letter of the 22nd May is attached to this Report (Annexure /*), but in his verbal protest, which was couched in much stronger terms, he stated that :— (а) He wished His Majesty's Government to enquire fully into the causes of the incursion which had taken place after peaceful conversations had been agreed upon, and even after my departure from London, and to fix the blame upon those responsible ; (б) He did not wish it thought that mere compensation would satisfy him ; (c) He reserved all his rights until a satisfactory explanation had been furnished ; (d) He made this communication verbally, as he did not wish to embarrass me more than he could help. 25. It was obvious that ibn Sa'ud was incensed to such a degree as to make it certain that, unless he received some satisfaction, he would refuse to sign the conditions of suspension, and thus involve a definite rupture. I, therefore, wrote to him on the same day (see my letter of the L2nd May, Annexure 7t) agreeing that any such incidents as those of which he complained would be contrary to the spirit of our negotiations and promising to report the matter 'without delay with a view to obtaining explanations and further information. In the meantime, I telegraphed to the High Commissioner at Baghdad 99 a statemen t of the facts (see my telegram No. 69 of the ? ¥ ay { J Anne ™ r ?'tl- 0n the Allowing day I received a reply bornhfh rl^ nry f ^ WhlCh 11 a PP eared tha t, although no ombs had been dropped and explanations of the action taken were mlntioned^ ^ in faCt ' been Cr0Ssed on the occasions AnnPvTrl TK q ! tele g ram N 0- 93 S. of the 23rd May, WW L h h Sa ud s m am complaint to the effect that his frontier had been violated afresh, even after peaceful negotiations and ag r ed Up0 r Was thus shown t0 be based on fact ; i ext f e ™ e T indl g na tion and the critical nature of the Hiffh ron!w 7 1 wa . s convinced that to put forward the would be wo ^ rS exp anatlon J s and arguments at that moment would be worse than useless, and would probably make a rupture * Page 79. f Page 78. + Page 80. § Page 81. ? Kdii11 inevitable. I therefore added nothing further to my letter of the 22nd May, which at least had the result of easing the situation sufficiently to secure Ibn Sa'ud's signature to the conditions of suspension {see my telegram No. 77 of the 25th May, Annexure 7*). 26. Ibn Sa'ud will doubtless raise the question again when we resume conversations, and I shall have to give him an answer. I suggest, in that event, furnishing him with the explanations supplied by the High Commissioner of 'Iraq. These explanations, however, are not likely to satisfy him, and in all the circumstances I am of opinion that it would be proper, and most certainly politic, to accompany them by a suitably-worded expression of regret. 27. During the course of our conversations I made it clear to Ibn Sa'ud that the 'Iraq Government would require to be com pensated for the lives and property destroyed in the attack on Busaiya Post, and would also expect that the loss of life and live stock occasioned to 'Iraq tribesmen by the subsequent raids should be made good in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Bahra Agreement. His Majesty did not make any direct reply to this statement, and I did not think it advisable to pursue the question pending settlement of the main point of difference ; but his advisers made it quite clear that the Najd Government proposed to submit a heavy counter-claim in respect of losses suffered by Najdi tribesmen during the Course of the operations carried out by the Royal Air Force. 28. I shall now proceed to report on the progress made in the dis cussion of the subsidiary questions. In paragraphs 14 to 24 of your letter under reference, mention is made of seven questions affecting the relations of Ibn Sa'ud with His Majesty's Government. The first relates to Italy's new position in Arabia. On that subject I had a long conversation with the King, which is summarised in the Record of Proceedings (Annexure 1, minutes of 9th meeting!) and more fully reported in the despatch which I shall have the honour to address to you separately. 29. The second relates to the position of the Sharifian rulers of 'Iraq and Trans-Jordan and their traditional hostility to Ibn Sa'ud. This question, which has long been a thorn in the latter's side, was frequently touched upon by him in our conversations. At the very first meeting I had with him, he gave bitter expression to his conviction that the scheming hand of King Faisal could be detected behind the present trouble, and that the dropping of warning notices and bombs had been cleverly prompted by the King of 'Iraq, who was a past master in the art of alienating Arab tribes and under mining his (Ibn Sa'ud's) ascendancy over them. I felt it necessary there and then to interrupt the King and give him a polite hint that, while I was always ready to lend a sympathetic ear to his grievances, * Page 82. f Pa g e 35 •12 I was not prepared to listen to aspersions on King Faisal's character, which seemed to me to exceed the bounds of legitimate criticism. I also gave him to understand, on more than one occasion, that the attitude and policy of His Majesty's Government towards himself were in no way influenced by the personal feelings of King Faisal and the Amir Abdullah. Whatever the effect of my words may have been, I failed to see any indication of a change in Ibn Sa'ud's attitude, or in his conviction that the Hashimite brothers were at the bottom of all his tribulations with His Majesty's Government. 30. The next four questions, namely, those relating to— (i) The activities of Bolshevik agents in the Hejaz ; (ii) The Hejaz Railway ; (iii) The abolition of Capitulations in the Hejaz ; (iv) The Haramain Waqfs; were not brought up by Ibn Sa'ud or by his advisers for discussion, and I abstained from taking the initiative in broaching them. From a perusal of the files at the British Agency, it was clear that Mr. Stonehewer-Bird had all the required information at his disposal and was in a position to deal with the questions if and when they were raised by Ibn Sa'ud. 31. The seventh question, which formed the subject of paragraphs 20 to 24 of your letter under reference, relates to the appointment of an arbitrator to adjudicate upon past raids across the Najd-Trans-Jordan frontier, and of a permanent Raids Officer to supervise the occurrence of future raids. This question was discussed at my seventh meeting with the King (see Annexure 1, minutes of seventh meeting*). His Majesty informed me that he was still in favour of the appointment of a British arbitrator, but that for various reasons he felt compelled to insist on certain conditions prior to the appointment of the arbitrator. On mv suggestion, it was agreed that the matter be fully discussed between his advisers and Mr. Antonius in committee. A series of committee meetings then took place, of which the proceedings are summarised in the memorandum drawn up by Mr. Antonius (see Annexure 3t). 32. As will be seen from that memorandum, Ibn Sa'ud is now pressing for the laying down of terms of reference designed to define the powers and duties of the arbitrator. His proposals seem to me to be on the whole fair and acceptable, and in this view I am supported by Lord Plumer and the British Resident at Amman with w om I discussed the matter fully during my brief stay in Jerusalem. But there is one clause in the terms of reference which appears to me to be unacceptable, namely, clause 5, which purports to exclude from the purview of the arbitration all past claims which were not officially registered at the time or soon after the occurrence of the * Page 31. f Page 63.-rrrr ' i '' ni ^ 13 raid. I am of opinion, and Lord Plumer concurs, that the adoption of this clause would mean that one of the two parties (in this case, Trans-Jordan), is to be deprived of a fair hearing on grounds of the omission of a formality which was not specifically laid down in the Hadda Agreement, and which would amount to an improper restriction of the discretion of the arbitrator who should alone decide whether a particular claim is worthy of being heard. 33. The King pressed insistently for the adoption of that clause, and his advisers informed Mr. Antonius that, unless it were inserted, he could not see his way to assent to the proposed arbitration. I refused to give way on that point, and, in view of the King s insistence, it was not possible to arrive at a final agreement on the terms of the proposed arbitration. 34. I would recommend, as a possible way out of the difficulty, that I should be authorised to inform His Majesty that, although His Majesty's Government cannot admit a condition of that nature which they regard as unnecessary and improper, they are prepared to give him an assurance to the effect that his views on that point would be fully communicated to the arbitrator. I would also recommend that the agreement to be arrived at prior to the appointment of the arbitrator should be recorded, not in a separate instrument as Ibn Sa'ud proposes, but in an exchange of notes. If this is approved, I should propose to address identical notes to the two Governments stating the conditions on which the arbitrator is to be appointed and asking each Government to inform me of its willingness to accept those conditions and abide by the terms of the adjudication. 35 The cognate question of the appointment of a permanent Raids Officer was discussed at the following meeting {see Annexure 1, minutes of 8th meeting*). I explained to the King the reasons why it had not been found practicable to adopt his former proposal. He saw the force of my explanations and declared himself in favour of postponing the consideration of this question until the proposed arbitration had materialised and effected a liquidation of past raids. 36. In a second letterf from you bearing the same number and date 'as your letter under reference, mention is made of two other questions. The first relates to the attack committed in February last by Ruwala tribesmen led by Farhan Ibn Mashur on certain sections of the Bani Sahkr tribes. In compliance with your instructions, I informed Ibn Sa'ud that His Majesty's Government appreciated his attitude on that point and hoped that he would effect a settlement fully compensating the Bani Sahkr tribes for their losses. Before I left Jedda, however, I received a verbal message from the King, who was then at Mecca, to the effect that news had just been received of a series of raids com mitted by Trans-Jordan tribes on * Page 33. t Pa g e 91 '14 tribes in the Wadi Sirhan, who were subject to him. I was not in a position to confirm or contradict the news, nor was I able when I visited Jersusalem ten days later to obtain any confirmation. I am given to understand, however, that news has since been received from Trans-Jordan which tends to confirm the accuracy of Ibn Sa'ud's information. If that is so, perhaps you will think it fit to convey to Ibn Sa'ud an assurance that the Trans-Jordan Government will take prompt and adequate measures to deal with the situation created by the raids on his tribes. 37. The second question relates to the air-route along the south western coast of the Persian Gulf and the supply of British pilots and mechanics to organise and operate Ibn Sa'ud's air service. On this question I made no attempt to approach Ibn Sa'ud. No settlement in regard to the main object of my mission having been arrived at, I did not judge it desirable to broach the question, even tentatively. 38. In your letter No. 59092/28 of the 18th April,* mention is made of a proposal put forward by the High Commissioner for 'Iraq, for a revised interpretation of Article 5 of the Bahra Agreement. This matter was discussed at Jedda, and Ibn Sa'ud signified his agreement to the principle of the revised interpretation as proposed by the High Commissioner for 'Iraq and concurred in by the High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan. In view, however, of the deadlock on the main question, it was not possible to secure Ibn Sa'ud's final assent to this proposal. 39. On his side, the King put forward a proposal for the conclusion of a Bon Voisinage Agreement, which was fully discussed between his advisers and the 'Iraq delegates. Similar discussions took place on the subject of the proposed Extradition Agreement, on the basis of the draft brought by Mr. Cornwallis and approved by the Council of Ministers in Baghdad. The proceedings and the progress made with regard to both Agreements are fully reported in Annexure 2,t while the texts of the relevant drafts will be found in Annexures 5 and 6. | I am of opinion that the conclusion of two such agreements would be a distinct step forward in the direction of improving the relations between 'Iraq and Najd. I would also recommend that efforts be made to obtain the assent of the Trans-Jordan Govern ment to the conclusion of two similar agreements between Trans- Jordan and Najd. Lord Plumer, with whom I discussed this matter in Jerusalem, declared himself thoroughly in favour of my proposal. 40. In the absence, however, of an amicable settlement on the major question of the posts, I do not anticipate that Ibn Sa'ud would consent at this stage to the conclusion of either of the proposed agreements. But this contingency need not deter the 'Iraq * 59092/28 [No. 12 C.]; not printed. t Pages 43-62. I Pages 69-77.15 Government from drawing up their own proposals in the light of Mr. Cornwallis's report to them ; so that, in the event of my Mission being sent out to resume negotiations with Ibn Sa'ud, I might find it possible to carry discussions a stage further towards finality. 41. One other question was brought up by Ibn Sa'ud, namely, the appointment of accredited Najdi representatives in the mandated territories of 'Iraq, Palestine and Trans-Jordan. His Majesty gave me to understand that he was dissatisfied with the growing number of contentious disputes, mostly of a trivial nature, which arose between Najdi trading caravans and petty officials in Trans- Jordan and Palestine. He also felt the need of a tactful and reliable person to represent him and defend his interests before the Govern ments of 'Iraq, Palestine and Trans-Jordan. Another reason which had prompted this proposal on His Majesty's part was his dissatisfaction with the delays which often took place in the exchange of letters and messages. He proposed that a fully-accredited representative should be appointed by him to Baghdad, and another to Jerusalem. The latter's credentials would cover both Palestine and Trans-Jordan. 42. On this question, too, I am of opinion that the adoption of Ibn Sa'ud's proposals would be a step in the right direction. I am informed by Mr. Antonius that the High Commissioner for Palestine is prepared' to assent to the appointment of a Najdi representative in Jerusalem. It would be desirable that the views of the 'Iraq Government on this matter be ascertained at an early opportunity. The appointment of a Najdi representative in Baghdad would entail the prior recognition by 'Iraq of Ibn Sa'ud as King of the Hejaz and of Najd and its Dependencies, and there is reason to believe that King Faisal would not readily assent to the granting of such recognition. It cannot be denied, on the other hand, that the formal recognition of the de facto sovereign of an adjoining country with which 'Iraq is in friendly treaty relations cannot be indefinitely withheld without prejudice to good relations between the two countries, and it is a matter for consideration whether the present crisis does not afford a suitable opportunity to grant Ibn Sa'ud the recognition on which he not unnaturally lays great stress. In this connection I would point out that Ibn Sa'ud's proposal for the conclusion of a Bon Voisinage Agreement will stand or fall according as the desired recognition is granted, or withheld. 43. On the 20th May, the King proceeded to Mecca after a formal farewell meeting at the Mission House on the afternoon of that day. His principal advisers remained in Jedda, where two or three meetings were held daily with them. On the 22nd May, Mr. Cornwallis and Captain Glubb sailed for Egypt, where they returned to Baghdad by air. On the 25th May, I sailed from Jedda on board H M.S. ' Dahlia' for Port Sudan, with Mr. Antonius and Flight-Lieutenant Moore, and on the morning of our arrival in16 Port Sudan, I left for Cairo by the overland route.

The first meeting took place at 8 a.m. on Tuesday, the 8th May, in the King's House, and was attended by the King, his four Advisers, Mr. Antonius, and myself. 2. I opened proceedings with the customary greetings and then informed the King of the object and composition of my Mission, emphasizing the fact that I had come out as Plenipotentiary on behalf of His Majesty's Government. I then said that His Majesty's Government, who naturally took a very serious view of recent events on the Traq frontier, were still confident that a frank and friendly discussion between the two parties would lead to a settle ment, and had, therefore, ordered me to come out. Lastly, I pointed out to His Majesty that the object of these discussions was not merely to agree upon and liquidate the events of the past but, what was even more important, to devise measures to prevent their occurrence in the future. 3. The King replied with a long statement, which may be briefly summarised as follows :— [a) He was absolutely convinced that the intentions of His Majesty's Government were friendly and that they had no desire to interfere in the internal affairs of his country. [h] One of the most mischievous causes of discord was the practice of intrigues set afoot by members of the Hashimite family, who sought not only to weaken his position but also to embroil him with His Majesty's Government. (c) Another factor was the unconscious credulity of British officials who were sometimes too prone to believe inaccurate reports spread with mischievous intent by self-interested persons. Having dwelt at length on those three points, and having reminded me of the numerous occasions in the past on which he had cause to draw the attention of His Majesty's Government to these factors, the King went on to give a long account of the circumstances which had led to the conclusion of the Protocol of Uqair. His argument was designed to show that Article 3 of the XJqair Protocol was concluded solely as a means of enabling him to accept the frontier between Traq and Najd, which was the main feature of the Muhammara Convention. He denied the allegation that he was not fully prepared to carry out his previous agreement, or that his representations on the subject18 of the Muhammara Convention were in any sense a disavowal of its provisions or a repudiation of his signature. He had every intention of respecting his undertaking, but he wished to explain how and why that undertakmg came to be given. The Muhammara Convention la been signed by his delegate in contravention of the instructions issued to him, and he (Ibn Sa'ud) had refused to ratify it. When X!' ,7 to U( l air six months later and insisted on the with fh i. 0 I Convention, King Ibn Sa'ud found himself faced with the choice between breaking with His Majesty's Government and consenting to a frontier which in his opinion violated the Protn ^ customs of the country. It was then that bem^ The ob A the all - im P ortant Article 3, came into fronfW in n ^ 0 i S Artlcle was to minimise the harm of a as Ibn Si'nf? ma 1C eSert c ? untr y an&lt; ^ its whole intention, as far territorv on l-fh aS 7 aS that ever y wa ter-point in that lccess7nT.h^ S1 + ^ fr ? ntier should alwa y s be left fr ce of forces ThpfT.

The solution of the difficulty presented by that awkward choice had been found in Article 3 of the Protocol of Uqair which, to his mind, meant clearly that no posts of any kind were to be established by either Government for any purpose at any of the water-points dotted about that desert area which was the traditional roaming-ground of the nomad tribes of both 'Iraq and Najd. 7. The King made a great point of this argument and repeatedly stated that that was, and always had been, his interpretation of Article 3 of the Protocol. He launched into a long discourse about the causes which had led him to insist on that provision, and to cite facts in support of his contention that such a provision was absolutely necessary for the maintenance of age-long tribal rights and for the preservation of peace. He alluded again to the incidents connected with Yusuf Sa'dun, Fahd ibn Hazzal, Hamud ibn Swait, etc., and dwelt at length on King Faisal's role as the villain of the piece. He then went on to cite, as yet another instance of King Faisal s misdoings, the warning notices and bombs dropped by aeroplanes on tribesmen in Najd territory, and said that when the news of this extraordinary action had reached Riad, the women in the palace had jeered at their menfolk, and that even his own father had refused to receive him. 8. I said to His Majesty that he appeared to have received an exaggerated account of the occurrences, that it would be well for him to consider carefully whether King Faisal's actions had been correctly reported to him, and that in any case His Majesty's Govern ment were fully cognisant with events on the 'Iraq side. My object was to give His Majesty a strong hint that the argument of Hashimite intrigues might be pushed too far and to prepare him for a sharper rejoinder in the future. I also said that his statements about the origin and implications of Article 3 of the Uqair Protocol differed substantially from the interpretation put upon them by His Majesty's Government, and that this showed the necessity for further discussion with a view to a closer definition of its real import. 9. His Majesty did not give a direct reply to this remark but went on with the narrative of events on which he had somewhat excitedly embarked. He said that when news of the erection of a fort at Busaiya reached him from his discontented people, he tried to reassure them by showing them the Protocol of Uqair, the contents of which he had not revealed to them previously. He then protested to 'Iraq, but before his protest had received satisfaction the fort had been attacked by Faisal-al-Dawish. He was not going to attempt to condone or minimise the action of the Mutair in attacking that fort, and in evidence of this he stated that as soon as he had heard of the attack he ordered the cutting off of supplies from the Mutair,21 -promptlii appreciation of the full and frank nature of his remarks, and said that I should like at the next meeting to acquaint him, with like frankness, with the views of His Majesty's Government. The meeting rose at 10.40 a.m., on the understanding that His Majesty would attend a meeting in the same afternoon at the Mission House. Second Meeting. The second meeting took place at 4 p.m. on Tuesday, the 8th May, at the Mission House, and was attended by the King, with his four advisers, Mr. Antonius and myself. 2. I opened proceedings by suggesting to His Majesty that, as he had given me a full and frank narrative of recent events as he saw them, so it might be useful if I were to give him a similarly frank account of events as they appeared to His Majesty's Govern ment. I began by explaining to the King that the measures taken on the 'Iraq side, at any rate all the important ones, had been taken with the approval of His Majesty's Government and in some cases on their initiative ; and that consequently the responsibility for those measures was fully shouldered by His Majesty's Government. I then gave Ibn Sa'ud the following summary of events. 3. I observed that His Majesty had made in the morning a great point of explaining his interpretation of Article 3 of the Uqair Protocol. It was my duty at the outset to point out to His Majesty that the interpretation put upon that Article by His Majesty's Government differed widely from his. His Majesty's Government had never intended and could not admit that that Article should be used to prevent either Government from exercising their undoubted right, indeed their duty, of taking such administrative measures for the supervision of the desert area as they might think necessary from time to time. In the second place, I pointed out to His Majesty that the Article dealt only with fortifications of a military nature, whereas the buildings that had been erected at Busaiya were clearly nothing more than a small police post for the better supervision and administration of the district I dwelt at some length on this distinction, and reminded His Majesty of the discussions and the correspondence that had taken place at Bahra with regard to the demilitarisation of Kaf. Thirdly, I pointed out that the great distance of Busaiya from the frontier made it out of the question to describe it as being ' in the vicinity of the frontier.' 4. The history of the events leading up to the crisis was briefly as follows :— In November, 1926, the 'Iraq Government decided to put up a small police post at Busaiya, largely with a view to checking raiding from or through 'Iraq into Najd, and no notice was taken of this22 action until September, 1927, when His Majesty first wrote to protest against the establishment of the post. In the interval, the Acting High Commissioner for 'Iraq had (in August, 1927) written to inform His Majesty of the reasons which had led the 'Iraq Government to establish the post. While correspondence was still proceeding on the subject, news was suddenly received of a savage attack on the post, the slaughter of all its occupants and the destruction of the building (5th November, 1927). I asked His Majesty to try to visualise the effect on public opinion not only in 'Iraq but also in England, of the news of a so brutal and unprovoked an attack by his people on a Government post in the territory of a friendly State. In spite of heavy pressure and grave provocation, His Majesty's Government abstained from taking any punitive or retaliatory measures, and, relying on his friendship and sense of fairness, contented themselves with protesting and demanding prompt justice. I ventured to thmk that His Majesty would appreciate the moderation shown by His Majesty's Government, all the more so as the attack on Busaiya could not be regarded as a raid in the ordinary tribal sense ; it was, m fact, a premeditated attack of an unusually ferocious nature, from the territory of a Government with whom only a few months ago His Majesty s Government had concluded a treaty of amitv and peace, on territory for the defence of which they were responsible. While His Majesty s Government and the 'Iraq Government were patiently awaiting the measures which they expected His Majesty to take a series of attacks began, in rapid succession to one another, all of them emanating from Najd. There was no evidence of any fT T - k 0f HlS ma i est y' and ^ seemed clear HI q Ma + I s eS h ? d g0t 0Ut 0f hand - 1 had no doubt that His Majesty, who was so famous as a man of action, would appreciate Hve^ for wh 0 l ma]est y s Government, in circumstances when kv / r I Were res Ponsible were being lost, and when ffis MJ 00 ! 11 ^ r 111 Great Britain and ' Ira q was running high. ^ Majesty s Government could delay no longer, and were obliged o take action in order to bring the situation under control Ibn Sa'ud Ind r' y lnf0rmed 0f HiS Majest y' s Government's decision, • d the neces s ar y measures were put into operation. Meanwhile m their desire to avoid the taking of any hostile action. His Majesty's re?~Britth ZTl ^ HlS whether would receive a British delegate with a view to putting an end to the in't^ neg0t + iatl0ns ' but Majesty had found it ffis Matstv wL t0 reCeive him - 1 wished t0 a sk is Majesty . what could any Government worthy of the name do m such circumstances other than use such means as were at thei? disposal to repel this stream of attacks ? NaM telStorvT™ t0 the dro P ping of war ning notes and bombs over protested at measure against which His Majesty had strongly protested at the mornings meeting, I gave him the reasons for23 those warnings, and explained that when His Majesty's Government found that it was imperative to repel and pursue raiders, they determined at the same time to take all possible steps to minimise the risk of damage to people who were unconnected with those raids. The only practical way was by dropping printed notes of warning to the tribes who were located at the time just over the border, and His Majesty must realise that this action was taken in the interests of his subjects. It was not correct to judge the drop ping of warning notes as an isolated measure ; it was a consequence of the decision to take active measures for the protection of 'Iraq against attack and as a precaution to safeguard innocent subjects of His Majesty. 6. I concluded my somewhat lengthy statement by thanking His Majesty for his patience in listening to me and in allowing me to speak to him in such frankness. He himself had been so outspoken in the morning that I had been encouraged to speak to him in the same measure of frankness in order that no doubt might be left in his mind as to the attitude of His Majesty's Government in this matter. 7. His Majesty replied by saying that in his life he had encountered two species of negotiators. The first was the kind who preferred, for fear of hurting his feelings, to gloss over difficulties and reproaches. The other kind went straight to the point and spoke frankly regardless of the pain that they might inflict. He had always had a marked predilection for the latter kind, and he wished to express his apprecia tion of my frankness. He said that he had a few observations to make on my statement. 8. The first was that he wished to emphasise his own interpretation of Article 3 of the Protocol of Uqair as being the correct one, and he begged me for verification to refer to the record of proceedings which Sir Percy Cox must have kept. Secondly, he wished to point out very briefly that in his view no distinction could be drawn between a military post and a police post in all matters relating to desert life. It was obvious that the King did not believe that the establish ment of a post at Busaiya was merely an administrative measure. He denied that a post garrisoned by police could exercise any real check upon the movements of raiders. He repeated that, whatever the rights and wrongs of the case may have been and whatever provocation His Majesty's Government may have received from Faisal al-Dawish's attack (of which he strongly disapproved) the fact remained that the action of the Royal Air Force was a flagrant infringement of agreements concluded between him on the one hand, and His Majesty's Government and the 'Iraq Government on the other. That, said His Majesty, with some warmth, is the real point at issue. He admitted that his subjects had committed thoroughly unjustifiable attacks on 'Iraq, which called for stringent punishment; but, on the other hand, it was incumbent on His Majesty's Government to24 admit that they, too, had taken action which violated his frontier and his recognised sovereignty. He added that only in the admission y both parties of the faults committed could we find a basis on which to negotiate the desired settlement, and he asked me again with some insistence to give careful consideration to that essential basis of agreement. tt ^' ^ S . the a PP 0 i n f e d time for the sunset prayer was drawing near His Majesty rose, and the meeting came to an end at 5 45 pm It was arranged that I should meet His Majesty on the following morning m his house, and that I should bring with me all the members of the Mission.

Whether nearp wac + k q e desired was to with His Majesty's Government. 0 attained or not rested now25 5. I observed that the principle of extradition had been agreed to at Bahra, that the main point for discussion was the definition of extraditable offences, and that I wished to put on record the fact that neither the 'Iraq Government nor His Majesty's Government could admit political offences as being extraditable. I suggested that His Majesty's advisers and the delegates from 'Iraq might meet and discuss the definition. The King agreed to this suggestion. I then pointed out again that if an Englishman, for example, opposed the Government in England or rebelled and then fled to a foreign country he would not be liable to extradition because these were political offences. The King at first replied that the omission of rebellion from extraditable crimes would nullify the value of the agreement, but he modified this statement by going on to say that he did not attach importance to the case of politicians who merely wrote or talked. He said that if His Majesty's Government did not fear that such persons would create trouble he also attached little value to them, more especially as there were no politicians in Najd but only tribesmen. I then inquired whether His Majesty would like to bring forward any specific cases in which officials in 'Iraq had infringed existing treaties by corresponding with Najd Shaikhs, adding that Captain Glubb, who had been on the frontier, was present and would be prepared to answer any accusations. The King replied that he did not desire to bring accusations, but there could be no doubt that officials in 'Iraq had not only written to, but had visited and talked with, Najd subjects. His objections to such procedure were : first, he feared that the officials themselves might be insulted or killed by Najdi tribesmen, and thereby create further trouble ; secondly, these visits had caused bitter feeling between the Najdi tribes themselves, those visited being accused by the Ikhwan of treachery. As an example, he stated that Faisal al-Dawish and Muhsin al-Firm had desired to raid Ibn Habbas because he had been visited by 'Iraq officials. I proposed that the Iraq delegates should discuss these questions with His Majesty's advisers, and requested His Majesty himself to be good enough to spare them half an hour of his time, adding that on the conclusion of my Mission I should normally be returning to London, whereas the execution of any agreements reached would rest in a large measure with the 'Iraq officials present. 6. The King agreed, adding that he did not accuse British officials of intentionally infringing agreements, but that they were bound by their verv position to further the interests of Iraq, and, moreover, the information which they received from Najd was often brought b\ evil persons desirous of creating trouble. There were many people in the vicinity of the frontier, such as Shammar, who sought favour in 'Iraq by carrying to 'Iraq officials distorted accounts of events in Najd, and that often the same people then returned to Najd and brought him equally distorted accounts of events in Iraq.Wraqol lblet henUo|, His |j 5 ls e at 8aii ^ Mr. Ajitoa:; deration of I previous into- had been froi ions put upc; vemraent i; ious mee% lat, since i ,nd elsewte ^ed itself into tribes to ti( ed that i ilties of ffi t they were possible ii ity over iis d said that lesmen liad aywithte erabarfed ird to tie consenteil anyotlier ■he Uqair sion tes gs. Tte : argued ) accept stiou as he 3 OOStS, 27 then all hope of a settlement would be lost and he would be faced with a very serious situation, in which he would have to choose one of three courses : either to let his people do their worst while he declined all responsibility for the consequences, or to join forces with his people in an attack upon 'Iraq, or to wage war upon his people. Each of those courses was equally intolerable. 4. The King spoke at great length in this strain. He was obviously faced with a very awkward situation, and appeared to speak with genuine feeling. I did not judge it wise to pursue the conversation on those lines any further for the moment. I therefore concluded by telling His Majesty that his advisers and the 'Iraq delegates were engaged in discussing other questions, such as the extradition of criminals, and I thought it was preferable for the present that His Majesty and myself should confine ourselves to discussion of what was obviously the major point at issue, namely, the posts. I asked the King to give his utmost consideration to the arguments that I put forward, and took my leave at 10.30 a.m. Fifth Meeting. The fifth meeting took place at 10 a.m. on Saturday, the 12th May, in the King's House, and was attended by the King, Mr. Antonius and myself. 2. In reply to my question as to whether he had anything to add to his previous statements the King replied in the negative. I then gave the following summary of the position :— The conversations of the past few days had shown quite clearly that the main issue lay in the question of the forts. His Majesty had repeatedly declared that the demolition of all posts in the desert area must be a prelude to any settlement. His Majesty's Govern ment, on the other hand, upheld the right of the 'Iraq Government to maintain forts at suitable points in that area as a matter of principle on which they were unable to give way. In view of this clear conflict between the two attitudes it was obvious that no settlement was possible unless some way could be found of squaring His Majesty's requirements with the principle laid down by His Majesty's Government. I wished to put it to His Majesty as a practical suggestion that it was for him, with his more intimate knowledge of his people and their mentality, to thinK of some solution which would enable him to pacify his people and restore order on the frontier without involving the dismantling of posts which the Government of 'Iraq had a clear right to establish and maintain.28 3. His Majesty replied by assuring me that, although he was himself deeply moved by what he considered to be wrongful acting of the 'Iraq Government, yet he would willingly have done violence to his own feelings for the sake of peace, had it not been for the high feeling among his people. He said that he himself was capable of sacrificing an immediate advantage for an ultimate gain, but that it was asking too much of his tribesmen to expect them to give way in a matter to which they attached such great importance, no matter how 7 wise or fruitful such an abandonment might eventually prove to be. He added that this was a question on which the people of Najd of all classes felt so strongly that they would never even question the justice of their own attitude. It would have been an easier task for him, added His Majesty, had they actually taken up arms against him. But being now up in arms against what they consider to be an outrage on their feelings and independence, and a menace to their liberty, they would never accept that he should assume any different attitude to that which they themselves had adopted. 4. The King went on to say that he had another point to make. As everyone knew, the flow of pilgrims to Mecca had begun some months ago and was now reaching its climax. This was a factor to which he had to pay the most careful consideration, and he could not afford, at a time when there was in the Hejaz a large concentra- v. 0rei ? n P 1 , &amp; r ^ ms ' to take measures which for obvious reasons might have involved a risk of disturbance in the Hejaz. The Kin? wfnf questl ° n ^ as one which had an important and direct fhnf hi pre f nt ^ ls ? lssio11 ' and he gave me the impression that his statement might be a prelude to some fresh disclosure or went Tt Pr0P0S fi!' f . Ut my im P ression was not borne out when he ent on to say that having considered the question from every oarticulai^ h 1 ^ who , \ he Arabs in general and his people in oermanpnt t 1 hat the onl y possible solution lay in the permanent dismantling of the posts with much reJS 5 M !l received this expression of opinion upon^iim thaf Hk Ma. ^ to accept it as final.

Its for ^ was on 6 primarily of co-operation, that is to say, of trying with His Majesty to discover, by a frank and friendly interchange of views, some solution of the difficulties with which he was faced. 6. The King replied by assuring me that he had no doubt what ever of the good intentions of His Majesty's Government and of the fact that they had not departed from their traditional friendship towards him. But his difficulty lay with his own people and with the difficult complex of religious, tribal and family traditions which was at the base of their society. He spoke at some length in this sense and gave me clearly to understand that he had spoken his last word in the matter of the demolition of posts. 7. I replied by appealing to His Majesty not to take a final decision at once. I said that perhaps it had escaped his attention that in this discussion His Majesty's Government were not asking any concession of His Majesty. Put concisely, their attitude was that they adhered to the maintenance of the posts as a matter of important principle, but that they were sincerely anxious to see peaceful relations between 'Iraq and Najd, and had sent me with instructions that I should use my best endeavours to find, in co-operation with His Majesty, a solution which would secure that end. If His Majesty maintained an attitude about the posts which was in such direct conflict with the principle laid down by His Majesty's Government, then the only possible result would be that I should have to admit failure in my effort to co-operate with His Majesty for the sake of the re-establishment of peace. I must, therefore, urge His Majesty not to arrive at a final decision without further consideration of my proposal which amounted to this, that when one door opening into a settlement was found to be definitely barred it was a natural and a wise course to try and find some other entrance. His Majesty, being better equipped than anybody else with knowledge of the people of Najd, was obviously the person most qualified to suggest the basis on which a settlement might be found. As I had previously and repeatedly told him he could count on my help in the fullest possible manner, not only in his efforts at finding a possible solution, but also in the task of presenting it to His Majesty's Government with absolute fairness and impartiality. 8. His Majesty replied by saying that he also disliked haste in such matters, and that he was quite willing to give further con sideration to the question. He did not, however, give any indication whatever of any intention on his part to modify his attitude, but merely gave expression to protestations of belief in the good intentions of His Majesty's Government. The meeting rose at 11.30 a.m.30 Sixth Meeting. The sixth meeting took place in the King's House at 9 a.m. on Wednesday, the 16th of May, and was attended by the King, with his four advisers, and by Mr. Cornwallis, Mr. Antonius, Captain Glubb, Flight-Lieutenant Moore, and myself. 2. I opened the meeting by asking His Majesty whether he had any suggestion to make which might lead to a way out of the dead lock at which we appeared to have arrived. He replied that after having thought over the whole question he had no proposal to make. 3. I then gave a brief summary of the situation, pointing out that the main obstacle to settlement was the wide divergence which had been discovered between the interpretation placed upon Article 3 of the Uqair Protocol by His Majesty's Government and that given to it by His Majesty. I did not wish to question His Majesty's statement of the view which he had always held, but I was bound to inform him quite definitely that His Majesty's Government and the 'Iraq Government had never contemplated, nor could accept, any other interpretation than that which I had now explained to him. They must hold to the principle that each Government in its own territory had the right to take such administrative and defensive measures as appeared suitable and necessary. I was, therefore, asking him to agree to discuss with me a formula which might remove all doubt as to the real meaning of the Article in question in order to prevent future misunderstandings. 4- There was nothing in the Uqair Protocol, as interpreted by . Ma i est y ^ Government or warninted. by the wording of its provisions, to prevent either Government from erecting posts, except within the narrow belt which was envisaged by the actual wording o Article 3. In point of fact, however, no fortified posts at all had been established, or even contemplated, until the attack on Busaiva and subsequent raids had made it essential to take adequate measures or the defence of the population living in Traq territory. In view of the attacks which had been made and of the disturbed state of his tribesmen, which had already been emphasized to me by His Majesty it was obviously impossible for the 'Iraq Government to dismantle the posts under the threat of armed force and to leave Traq exposed to similar attacks in the future. 5. With regard to the question of compensation, the attack on Busaiya had caused loss of life and property, and the Traq Govern- ment asked for compensation for the lives of policemen and employees ailed and for material destroyed. There were also the losses inflicted on Iraq tribesmen m the course of raids subsequent to the attack on Busaiya, and I requested His Majesty to agree to reparation being arranged for in accordance with the procedure laid down in the relevant agreements m force.31 6. His Majesty replied in a long statement, recapitulating his former arguments and again insisting on his interpretation of Article 3 of the Uqair Protocol. He also enlarged once more on the dangerous state of excitement and indignation which prevailed among his people in consequence of an outrage to their feelings, which he himself shared to the fullest possible extent. There was nothing in His Majesty's statement which gave any indication of an intention to retreat in the slightest degree from the position which he had taken up on these two major questions. 7. I then pointed out that His Majesty's Government had special interests which were also involved, in view of the development of Imperial air communications, and the possible laying down of a pipe line in the desert corridor between Trans-Jordan and Iraq. It was impossible to subscribe to any arrangement which might preclude the erection in the desert of such posts or buildings as might be found necessary from time to time. 8. His Majesty did not make any direct reply to this observation, but continued to urge that military posts in the desert were regarded by his people and by himself as a menace to their rights and liberties, and that he could never agree to them. 9 After a lengthy conversation in the above strain it appeared to me useless to prolong the interview any further and I therefore asked permission to take our leave, and the meeting rose at 10.30 a.m. Seventh Meeting. The seventh meeting took place at 4 p.m. on Wednesday, the 16th May, at the Mission House, and was attended by the King, with his four advisers, Mr. Antonius and myself. 2. I opened proceedings by suggesting that at this meeting 'ue should discuss outstanding questions relating to Trans-Jordan. 3. I reminded the King that, during the course of our conversa tions last year in connection with the Treaty of Jedda, he had proposed that the outstanding claims for damages due on account of raids between Najd and Trans-Jordan should be finally settled by reference to an arbitrator, who should be an Englishman uncon nected with Najd, Trans-Jordan or 'Iraq, and chosen in agreement between the Governments concerned. I briefly reviewed the com munications which had passed on this subject during the past year,, and informed His Majesty that His Majesty's Government were now willing to accept his proposal if he still held the same views. The King replied by saying that he had not changed his views m principle, but that there were one or two observations which he wished32 to make. At the abortive meeting of the tribunal which had taken place (at Jericho) he had submitted his list of claims, but had been unfavourably impressed by the fact that after his own list had been received the Trans-Jordan Government had presented a supple mentary list, entirely unsupported by data or evidence and including a number of claims which had never been raised before and which he was unable to admit for consideration. He did not think that any useful purpose would be served by the appointment of an arbitrator if it were open to either Government to ' spring ' fresh claims, which had not been formally recorded in good time. He was, therefore, of opinion that, before the arbitrator was appointed, terms of reference should be drawn up and agreed upon, which would lay down certain principles on which the arbitrator should work, and ensure in particular that no new claims for past raids could be ' sprung ' on the arbitrator. I replied that this appeared a reasonable suggestion, but that I reserved my opinion until I knew exactly the nature and scope of the terms of reference which His Majesty had in mind. It was decided that the terms of reference should be discussed between his advisers and Mr. Antonius. 4. The question of Auda al-Atneh was then discussed, and his record of crimes examined. I pointed out that the crimes had all been committed in Hejaz territory, and that the Trans-Jordan Government did not regard him as one of their subjects, but as one of the chiefs of tribes resident in the Hejaz. The Trans-Jordan Government, however, would only be too pleased if the Najd authorities would capture him and punish him as he deserved. The King suggested that if for a given period, say of one month, the Trans-Jordan Government would undertake to block the frontier, his people would be able to organise a drive along their side which would result in the capture of this disturber of the peace. I promised to bring this suggestion to the notice of the Trans-Jordan Govern ment for consideration, and expressed the view that they would welcome it provided no practical difficulties prevented its being put into execution. t 5: . At A he con 1 clusion of the meeting I informed His Majesty that 1 wished to explain to him more clearly the statement which I made at the sixth meeting m regard to the air communications and the pi pe hue. On thinking over our remarks it had struck me that he might possibly have misunderstood me, and gained the impression that the existing posts, of which he was complaining, were due.in rimri 10 air - for J: e requirements, and, therefore, designed as bases for attack against him. I explained that all I meant to convey was that the existence of the Imperial air route and the possible necessity hereafter for a pipe line made it imperative for His Majesty's Government to ensure that no principle was recognised which did33 not permit of such measures of defence and upkeep as might be required on that route which for a considerable distance passed through the desert areas. Ibn Sa'ud assured me that he quite understood and that, in any case, he had no intention of even threatening or interfering with the air route, which he fully recognised as a vital Imperial interest. As the hour of evening prayer was approaching the meeting rose at 5.15 p.m. Eighth Meeting. The eighth meeting was held at the King's House at 8 a.m. on Thursday, the 17th May, and was attended by the King, with his four advisers, Mr. Antonius and myself. 2. I informed the King that there were still one or two questions in regard to Trans-Jordan which required discussion. At the last meeting we had examined the question of settlement of claims for past raids, but we had not touched upon the further suggestion which His Majesty had made to me at Jedda last year for the settlement of disputes arising out of raids in the future. I alluded to the suggestion that a Frontier Inspector, who was neither an official of Najd nor of Trans-Jordan, should be appointed, to whom details of raids would be furnished at the time of their occurrence, and who would thus be in a position to collect timely and reliable information for the guidance of any tribunal which might be subsequently set up. I informed His Majesty that this proposal had been examined by His Majesty's Government and by the Trans-Jordan Government, who were both of opinion that it presented serious practical difficulties which, in their opinion, precluded its adoption. The chief of these difficulties being, first, that this official would owe no allegiance to either Government, and, secondly, that it was unlikely that the work entailed would justify the employment of a whole-time officer. 3. The King said that he saw the force of this argument, and suggested that an arbitrator, selected from outside and unconnected with either country, but with experience of Arab affairs, should be selected by agreement between the two Governments at any time when a dispute arose which could not be settled by the normal procedure which had been laid down in the Hadda Agreement. 4. I agreed that this was a possible solution, but I expressed thfe hope that cases of dispute would be rare, bearing in mind that with close co-operation and constant exchange of information the majority of claims should be settled without even the necessity of reference to a tribunal. This had been the case in the recent raid of the Ruwala into Trans-Jordan, which was being settled, thanks to (13548 C) c34 orders whieh His Majesty had promptly issued to his Governor at Jaui. I added that I wished to seize this opportunity of recording the appreciation of the Trans-Jordan Government. • 5 ' I t i, pr0 u e f! d ^ draw His Majesty's attention to the fact that since the Hadda Agreement there had been a notable diminution m raids from Trans-Jordan into Najd, which showed that the Irans-Jordan Government were doing their utmost to act up to the terms of that agreement. I informed him that the Amir Abdullah had two years ago summoned the principal Trans-Jordan Shaikhs and secured undertakings from them that they would not raid an action which had undoubtedly contributed greatly towards'the improved situation on the frontier. This was in May, 1926 and Tran^ Sn 0 ^^ 0 T t w Cated by the Hi &amp; h Commissioner for ffinSt dirt n t J T ad taken place Since that date - nis Majesty did not refute my statements, but embarked on a wvirus to The H drt SC T Se ab0Ut the raids Which had taken previous to the Hadda Agreement. To this I replied that all those oft' r rbftX re XT d \ y ' he a ' a 'g em ents for the appointment 01 an arbitrator which we had already discussed. 6 His Majesty then raised the question of an Extradition Am-PP ment with the Trans-Jordan Government, anrexpressef the dSire' countr^^as^^s^ow^'being^iscussed fort^f the tWO Najd Government and tSf He between the natme tle i exprSmvit 1 ' 6 With0Ut an ^men^of tlhs £ ss=a=SISS Sir? .'EdiSt 'byTSnTX S. representative^ at E^ghdad ^nd 6 Jeru^le'm a f P p01 ' tment Na i d looking after the interests of his countrv a Td n i P 'r rp0Se 0f Palestine and Trans-Jordan respectively P P In Iraq and by him presmte^^n^'advantaeeVT aS SUJ ?8 cSted to closer mutual understanding asking him'atth do ubtIess lead he wished this arrangement to be ^dprocal t,n ; e raise any definite objection to reciDroritv fhA ? t dld not particular reason for it is Hk R + sa he saw 110 Consul in Jedda was able to dfall Ma est y' s A gent and interests of 'Iraqis and Trans-torda^ 1° Pr0teCt the it would be necessary for the 'Iran r ' add ed, however, that Kingdom of the Hejaz and Naid t0 reCC « nise the spoke with some heat on tWs y . had n0t yet done - He situation which had been created V the 'Cq Govetmenf .n35 at atoiiieiif.- •o&amp;ble 'is^- ^o«td tlat; 51 to act up to; ^AmirAii s-Jonkn ooid noirdii. ■dv toward; ■ % 1936, e ■ominiisoiier: since that (is embarked a iad taken pk: d that all tk ie appointe aditioD .^rtr sed the da ween the ti between it lamelioratios ementofi iggested tki unittee witi being agrd jrnment fffl uraent, entofNajd purpose ol 'Iraq ana suggestffl itless lea&lt;i ie whether y did d 01 ie saw no Tent and otect the ver, ^ vise the ne. $ illogiffl ient ifl refusing recognition, which had been freely accorded by Great Britain, the Power which held a mandate for 'Iraq. I took my departure at 9.30 a.m., making way for Mr. Cornwallis, to whom His Majesty had granted a private interview. On the evening of the 17th May, the King's advisers, who were holding a meeting with Mr. Antonius, asked to see me, and delivered the following message from the King : The time was drawing near when His Majesty would have to proceed to Mecca in order to supervise the pilgrimage, and he felt obliged to leave on Sunday, or at the very latest on Monday morning next. He, therefore, wished to ask me whether it would be possible to bring our conversations to a close by that time, adding that he would not only leave behind in Jedda those of his advisers who might be required for further discussions, but would also, if necessary, come to Jedda himself for half a day at a time. I replied that I was aware of the approach of the pilgrimage feast, and that I would endeavour to fall in with His Majesty's wishes. Ninth Meeting. The ninth meeting took place at the King's House at 8 a.m. on Friday, the 18th May, and was attended by the King, his four advisers, Mr. Antonius and myself. 2. I opened proceedings by referring to the approach of the pil grimage and His Majesty's departure for Mecca, and I proposed the following time-table to His Majesty, namely, that I should devote the present meeting to discussing Italian policy in the Red Sea, a question which he himself had raised and on which he had asked for His Majesty's Government's views, and that the afternoon would be spent by Mr. Antonius in committee with the King's advisers in discussing pending questions relating to Trans-Jordan and 'Iraq. I also proposed that the following day should be spent in final discussion of 'Iraq and Trans-Jordan matters and in bringing our conversations on the major question of the forts to a final stage. 3. In a letter sent to Lord Lloyd through Shaikh Hafez Wahba, His Majesty had expressed anxiety at the turn events were taking in relation to Italian activities in Arabia and the Red Sea, and had asked His Majesty's Government for a statement of their views. I was able to inform His Majesty that, on the receipt of his letter. His Majesty's Government had made friendly representations to the Italian Government in accordance with the spirit of the under standing arrived at in Rome in February, 1927, with which His Majesty was acquainted. The Italian Government had replied with assurances which had fully satisfied His Majesty s Government that they were carrying out the spirit of that understanding. (13548 C) c236 4 The King replied at some length, and seized an opportunity for which he had evidently been waiting to expound his views on Italian policy and on the kindred question of the Yaman. His statement was interesting and valuable, and I was struck by his evident frankness. 5. I replied re-affirming the spirit in which His Majesty's Govern ment envisaged this question and emphasising the complete under standing which existed between them and the Italian Government. I also said that His Majesty's Government would always be glad to hear His Majesty's views, and when necessary would do all they could to dispel any suspicions which he might entertain by a frank exchange of information with the Italian Government. 6. The meeting rose at 10 a.m. Tenth Meeting. The tenth meeting took place in the King's House at 8 a.m. on Saturday, the 19th May, and was attended by the King, with his four advisers, and by Mr. Cornwallis, Mr. Antonius and myself. His Majesty's brother, Muhammad ibn Abdul-Rahman, and Shaikh Abdullah al-Fadl were also present. 2. I opened the meeting by saying to His Majesty that the time had now come, in view of the necessity of his early departure to Mecca, to reach a conclusion on the major question of the posts, on which we had so far been unable to come to any agreement. I asked His Majesty's permission to give a brief summary of the situation as it emerged from the conversations which we had had together in order to be quite certain that my appreciation was correct. I then gave the following summary :— 3. I said that it appeared that His Majesty's objections to the maintenance and establishment of posts, whether military or administrative, in the desert areas of 'Iraq were based upon his inter pretation of the terms of Article 3 of the Uqair Protocol, and it was evident that there was a wide divergence between the views of His Majesty and those of His Majesty's Government and the 'Iraq Government with regard to the meaning of that Article. His Majesty had given me to understand that he had always interpreted the Article as forbidding the erection of any posts, whether military or administrative, in that desert area of 'Iraq which adjoined the Traq-Najd frontier. 4. His Majesty's Government were unable to accept this interpre tation as expressing the intention of the Article in question, and must maintain the principle that both the Governments of 'Iraq and Najd were free to take such administrative measures, and establish such37 posts, as they might consider necessary within the limits of their own territory, subject only to the limitation imposed by His Majesty's Government's interpretation of Article 3. 5. In accordance with this principle. His Majesty's Government were unable to accede to His Majesty's request for the removal of the existing posts, the establishment of which had not, in the view of His Majesty's Government, violated in any way the terms of Article 3 of the Uqair Protocol. I had, therefore, requested His Majesty to discuss with me an explanatory definition of the meaning of Article 3 of the Uqair Protocol with a view to elucidating its meaning and making it proof against misunderstandings. 6. I had assured His Majesty that I was prepared to give him a definite assurance that any posts, whether military or administrative, which had been established or which it might be found necessary to establish in the future, were not designed in any measure whatsoever as bases for offensive action or as a threat against his Kingdom or any of the tribes or persons who might owe allegiance to him. I had also assured His Majesty on behalf of His Majesty's Govern ment that the establishment of any such posts would not be permitted to cause hindrance to the free movement, under the terms of existing agreements, of tribes owing allegiance to His Majesty, in the pursuit of grazing or in the exercise of any other rights they might possess in 'Iraq on the strength of established custom and under the treaties and agreements now in force. 7. I had also informed His Majesty that the 'Iraq Government requested compensation in respect of the lives and property which had been destroyed in the recent attack on the Busaiya post ; and also demanded that the loss of life and live stock occasioned to 'Iraq tribesmen by the raids into 'Iraq, subsequent to the attack on the Busaiya post, should be made good in accordance with the procedure which was laid down in existing agreements. I concluded the summary by stating that I understood that His Majesty was unable to give way or retreat from the attitude which he had taken up ; while, on the other hand, I had found it impossible to meet him by any renunciation of the principles to which His Majesty's Government adhered. I asked His Majesty whether he considered this a fair summary of the situation, and whether he desired to make any remarks. 8. His Majesty, after some further explanation by me, agreed that my statement of the position was correct. He then proceeded to repeat the arguments which he had advanced in previous meetings, emphasising particularly the difficult situation in which he was placed in regard to his tribesmen. He concluded by expressing once more his opinion on the subject of the aeroplane incursions into Najd and reiterating his view that whatever explanations might be • 1 (13548 C) c 3' 0 \ 39 12. I added that I should have to discuss at a later meeting certain arrangements which it would be necessary to agree upon in order to prevent as far as possible the occurrence of untoward incidents during the period of suspension. It was decided that His Majesty should grant me another interview in the afternoon. The meeting rose at 10.30 a.m. Eleventh Meeting. The eleventh meeting took place at the Mission House at 3.45 p.m. on Saturday, the 19th May, and was attended by the King, with his four advisers, and by Mr. Cornwallis, Mr. Antonius, Captain Glubb, Flight-Lieutenant Moore, and myself. 2. I informed the King that I had been considering the question of how best to prevent the occurrence of untoward incidents during the period of suspension of our conversations. There were various ns t questions under dispute which had given rise to differences of opinion from time to time, and it might be well to make some provisional arrangement which would prevent their arising in an acute form during that period. I then enumerated some of these questions in the following general terms :— {a) It was obvious that both sides should agree to take no offensive action against each other and to do everything in their power to prevent their tribes from acts of aggression. Should any tribes offend they should be punished under existing treaties, and should any incidents occur, immediate communication should take place between the two Governments with a view to avoiding misunderstandings. {b) It should be understood that each Government had the right to take such measures as it considered necessary to prevent incidents of the nature referred to, and for the purposes of defence. (c) It would be advisable to make some agreement regarding the surrender of tribesmen who raided into the other country and sought refuge in order to escape punishment by their Government. This question had already been under discussion between His Majesty's advisers and the 'Iraq delegates, and a draft was in course of preparation. {d) His Majesty's advisers had raised a question in regard to Article 6 of the Bahra Agreement as to whether it included military police, desert police and Air Force, and whether His Majesty's Government admitted that British forces serving in 'Iraq came under the terms of the Article. I was able to give His Majesty an affirmative answer to this question. (13548 C) c 440 [e) I suggested that an exchange of letters should take place in regard to Article 5 of the Bahra Agreement, making it clear that there would be no objection to either Govern ment communicating on administrative, but not on political, matters, with any tribes or Shaikhs of the other Government who might be temporarily within their territory for grazing or other purposes. It was clear, of course, that no communication was permissible with Shaikhs or tribes of the other Government when in the territory to which they owed allegiance. (/) His Majesty's advisers had also desired an assurance that the provisions of Article 5 of the Bahra Agreement included not only officials who were nationals of the two Governments but also foreign officials serving under them. I was able to give an answer to this question in the affirmative. (g) The 'Iraq Government had no wish to place any obstacle in the way of the return of the Najd Shammar to Najd should they desire to do so, but if in the meantime they committed any offence in or from 'Iraq they would be punished by the 'Iraq Government. [h) There was no objection on the part of the 'Iraq Government to the granting of Musabala to Najd tribesmen provided that they had not raided during or since the Busaiya incident. 3. I had intended to add that it was expected that the Najd Government would apply strictly the terms of Article 4 of the Bahra Agreement to the case of the Dhafir, but after having touched on the above points in general terms, I realised that they were giving rise to suspicion and creating opportunities for acrimonious argument. I therefore concluded by informing His Majesty that I only raised-these points now as examples, and asked him to think the whole question over and let me know the next day whether he considered any provisional agreement would assist in removing possible causes of friction during the period of the suspension. 4. His Majesty made a few general remarks, more especially on the question of Musabala, which, he said, was very necessary to his tribesmen, although he himself was naturally not anxious that they should visit Iraq ; but I could see that he was somewhat disturbed and anxious. The time of evening prayer was approaching, and His Majesty took his leave. In the evening of Saturday, the 19th May, and early on the follow- mg morning lengthy discussions took place between His Majesty's advisers and the Iraq delegates and Mr. Antonius, and, as a result o t ese conversations, it was evident to me that far from removing41 causes of friction, discussion of any provisional agreement on these various contentious points would only lead to suspicion and distrust on the part of the Najd authorities. His Majesty's advisers brought up many points, and contested them hotly. I was also of opinion that a detailed agreement at this stage, however much its provisional nature might be emphasized, would hamper subsequent negotiations for permanent agreement, and inevitably be quoted as a precedent. I therefore decided to drop the whole question and confine the conditions of suspension to a general undertaking on both sides to refrain from offensive action and do their utmost to abstain from any measures which might be misunderstood and cause suspicion to the other Government or excitement among the tribes. Twelfth Meeting. The twelfth meeting was held at the King's House at 10 a.m. on Sunday, the 20th May, and was attended by the King, with his four advisers, Mr. Antonius and myself. 2. I opened the meeting by asking His Majesty whether he had any observations to make on the points which I had raised on the previous evening. He referred to two or three points which had been hotly contested by his advisers in sub-committee, notably to the statement that each Government had the right to take such measures as it thought fit for the purpose of defence, and to the undertaking to abide by existing treaties, in regard to which he insisted that his interpretation of the Uqair Protocol should be accepted. 3. After listening for a short time' I interposed and informed His Majesty that I had only suggested that a provisional agreement on these points should be concluded in the hope that it might help to remove possible causes of misunderstanding. I had not put forward my suggestion in any spirit of bargaining or with any endeavour to score tactical points. It appeared obvious, however, from the result of the discussions in sub-committee, and to some extent from His Majesty's remarks, that my intentions had been misunderstood and that the effect of my suggestion had been to arouse suspicion and distrust. I added, with some heat, that if this was the spirit on which the conversations had to be suspended there was not much hope of avoiding misunderstandings and unpleasant incidents in the future. His Majesty had always assured me of his complete trust in my fairness and impartiality, and I could not but regret that my suggestion, which had been made with the best intentions, appeared to have been attributed to a desire to get the better of the Najd Government. His Majesty then interrupted with vehemence, assuring me of his complete confidence in the good intentions of His Majesty's Government and in my personal friendship and impartiality.42 4 I expressed my gratitude for this reiteration of his confidence and then proceeded to inform him that in any case I had come to the conclusion that it was essential to confine ourselves to a general statement. It would be impossible in detailed provisional agree- ments to safeguard all possible causes of friction, and we should lerefore, confine ourselves to general assurances of a sincere endeavour to preserve the peace and avoid hampering our future conversations by any unfortunate incident. The crux of the matter was that each Government should use its best endeavour to this end and if necessary subordinate its own interests for the moment 1 necessit y of maintaining and promoting an atmosphere of confidence and tranquillity. ?

MEMORANDUM AND MINUTES OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE TRAQ-NAJD SUB-COMMITTEE. I.—Memorandum on the Matters discussed in Committee between the 'Iraq and Najd Representatives at Jedda. Seven meetings were held between the 12th May and the 20th May, 1928, the minutes of which are appended hereto. The 'Iraq representatives were Mr. Cornwallis and Captain Glubb. The Najd representatives were Dr. Abdullah Damluji, Shaikh Yusuf Yasin, Shaikh Hafez Wahba and Shaikh Fuad Hamza. The following is a resume of the subjects which were discussed and of the conclusions which were reached :— 1. An extradition agreement, as provided for in Article 10 of the Bahra Agreement. The 'Iraq representatives brought with them a draft of an extradition agreement which had been approved by the Council of Ministers at Baghdad before their departure. This they put forward as a basis for discussion, and the Najd representa tives, after taking it away to study, produced in their turn a counterdraft (Annexure 5, I*). The latter contained a number of alterations in the wording which were in certain cases unacceptable, and differed from the 'Iraq draft in three important matters, namely, that— [а) It proposed that extradition should apply to persons of all nationalities instead of being confined to Najdis committing crimes in Najd and 'Iraqis committing crimes in 'Iraq. (б) It included raiding and assaults or attempts against persons of the King and members of the Royal Houses, as extraditable crimes. (c) It laid down that crimes committed by tribesmen could in no case be regarded as political crimes. The Najd representatives, after referring to their King, accepted the narrower 'Iraq definition of the persons to whom extradition should apply. On reference being made to Baghdad, point (6) was accepted and point (c) rejected. The question of the extradition of tribesmen for political as well as for non-political crimes appeared to be of great importance to the Najd representatives, and they * Page 69.44 even went so far as to say that without the inclusion of such a provision no extradition agreement would be acceptable. When they were informed of the final view of the 'Iraq Government, the King had already gone to Mecca, and it is therefore not known how he will accept the decision. In any case, they appeared to hold the view that the extradition agreement should be concluded at the same time as the Bon Voisinage Agreement, to which reference is made later in this memorandum, so that it is unlikely that any immediate result will be reached. 2. The Najd representatives attached great importance to the surrender of tribesmen who committed an extraditable offence in the neighbouring territory and either remained there or sought refuge there in order to escape punishment at the hands of their own Government. The 'Iraq representatives, after reference to Baghdad, submitted a draft which limited the offences to that of raiding. The Najd representatives for a long time insisted on including this matter in the extradition agreement, but eventually consented that Sir Gilbert Clayton should address a letter to His Majesty the King in the sense of the 'Iraq draft. 3. During the negotiation of the Bahra Agreement His Majesty the King had pressed strongly that each Government should under take, at the request of the other Government, to return any tribe or portion of a tribe or party of individuals who might seek refuge in the territory of the other Government. The 'Iraq Government did not at the time agree and Article 4 of the Bahra Agreement was ^fted to meet its views. At the first meeting, on the 12th May, 1928, the Na]d representatives stated that they held to their former views. But when they realised that a modification of the Bahra Agreement was involved, and after reference to His Majesty the King, they shifted their ground and said that they only asked for e return of criminals. Since this meant the surrender of tribesmen 0r ^ 01 i U ^ • aS - w as ^ or non ~political crimes, no progress was ma e , y 1 is possible that, at some later date, when relations are less strained and an agreement on the question of the tribes W i 1 ? r Se nationahty is m dispute has been reached, the original proposal ri?H 1S w Je i e , Km £ ma y be conveniently adopted, since action taken under the terms of the Residence Law and without recourse to an extradition agreement. W+wJ quest K 10n of t ^ e disputed tribes was discussed at some length, but without result. (a) Shammar Najd. The Najd representatives were informed that the Shammar Najd, who had come into 'Iraq in 1921 had automatically become 'Iraqi subjects under the ''Iraq a lona i y Law, but that the 'Iraq Government put no obstacles in the way of those who wished to return to Najd.45 (6) Dafir. The only statement obtainable from the Najd repre sentatives regarding this tribe which migrated to Najd after the Bahra Agreement and which, it is maintained, has not been dealt with in accordance with Article 4 of that Agreement, was that if the 'Iraq Government held the Shammar Najd to be 'Iraqis, the Najd Government would consider the Dafir to be Najdis. The futility of discussing the question in the face of such statements was apparent and the matter was therefore dropped. (c) Dahamsha. The Najd representatives repeated the arguments already put forward by His Majesty the King that the Dahamsha were accorded to him by Article 1 of the Uqair Protocol. It is evident both from the expression of their views and from a private conversation which Mr. Cornwallis had with His Majesty, that some misunder standing had occurred at Uqair, and that the Najdis genuinely feel that they have not been fairly dealt with in this matter. On the other hand, the 'Iraq Government has never had any intimation that Article 1 of the Protocol was designed to cover the case of the Dahamsha, and, since this tribe is a section of the Amarat which was allotted to 'Iraq by the Muhammara Convention, it has been felt with equal genuineness that Najd has no right to claim them. The misunderstanding is similar to that which has arisen with regard to the interpretation of Article 3 of the Uqair Protocol, and it is obvious that agreement can only be reached when the political atmosphere becomes calmer than it is at present. 5. The question of claims was discussed generally, and it was agreed to abide by the decision reached in the autumn of 1927 that claims for raids prior to that date should be abandoned by both sides. The 'Iraq representatives, however, stated that they had claims to make both for the attack on Busaiya and for the raids which followed. The Najd representatives stated that they had not prepared a list of claims and did not intend to make any unless the 'Iraq Government did so. In the latter event, they would produce a list in excess of the 'Iraq claims. It was eventually decided that this was a matter which should be discussed between His Majesty and Sir Gilbert Clayton. 6. During the course of the discussion, the Najd representatives produced a draft Bon Voisinage Agreement (Annexure 6, I and II*) for 'a permanent peace which cannot be disturbed.' The 'Iraq representatives stated that they were not authorised to make or * Pages 73-77.46 even discuss such a treaty, but that in order to do everything possible to improve relations between the two Governments they were willing to enter into informal and unofficial discussion. The proposed agreement raises difficult questions such as recognition and its corollaries, namely, diplomatic and consular representation, but, for the rest, is concerned with useful measures of co-operation in such matters as preventing either country from being used as a base for hostile activities against the other, in giving rapid information about such activities or about raids, and in defining channels of correspondence. The document is in many respects most praise worthy, although it somewhat naively ignores the present difficulties. 7. The 'Iraq representatives were very anxious to make some arrangement about close co-operation between frontier officials and proposed that there should be either a joint post on the frontier or in the neutral zone, or, alternatively, that frontier commissioners should be appointed. Probably because they thought that such an arrangement would result in a more frequent appearance of 'Iraq officials near the frontier and in a closer administration of the tribes, neither the Najd representatives, nor, subsequently, His Majesty the King agreed with either of these proposals. They affected to believe that their adoption would only lead to misunderstandings and intrigues and that the existing channels of communication, which in reality have done nothing to improve relations, were alone satisfactory. 8. The interpretation of Article 5 of the Bahra Agreement was discussed and a satisfactory formula reached. This was reserved for an eventual exchange of notes between His Majesty the King and Sir Gilbert Clayton. 9. The Najd representatives appeared sensitive about the criticisms of the Baghdad Press and asked that articles hostile to Najd should be suppressed. It was pointed out to them that the Press in 'Iraq was free, but that everything possible would be done to moderate its tone. Jedda. 22nd May, 1928.p) 47 n.—Minutes of Meetings of 'Iraq-Najd Sub-Committee. First Meeting. 4 p.m., 9th May, 1928. Present :— Mr. Cornwallis. Captain Glubb. Flight-Lieutenant Moore. Dr. Abdullah Damluji. Shaikh Yusuf Yasin. Shaikh Hafez Wahba. Shaikh Fuad Hamza. 1. Mr. Cornwallis said that he presumed the object of the meeting was to discuss an extradition agreement as provided under Article 10 of the Bahra Agreement. He inquired whether His Majesty desired an extradition treaty similar to those in force between European Powers, or whether, in view of the special conditions prevalent amongst nomad tribes he wished for something less general in its scope. Dr. Damluji replied that a broad agreement including extradition of tribes was wanted. Mr. Cornwallis inquired whether, for example, it was proposed that a shaikh who for some reason or other was dissatisfied with his Government and crossed into the territory of the other Government though without committing a specific crime should be included. Dr. Damluji replied that the King desired the inclusion of such a case. Mr. Cornwallis then inquired whether, for example, in the case of a Najd shaikh or tribe who were to raid into 'Iraq and then return to Najd but who subsequently escaped to 'Iraq to avoid punishment, extradition w T ould be demanded. Dr. Damluji answered that this was the most important type of case which it was desired to include. Mr. Cornwallis pointed out that the surrender of such individuals could not come under the heading of extradition, the crime having been committed in 'Iraq. To this. Dr. Damluji answered that, in that case, a special agreement would have to be made to cover such incidents. Mr. Cornwallis then asked the Najd delegates what they considered to be a political offence, lo this, they were unable to reply, except by asking the 'Iraq delegates to put forward a definition. Eventually, they suggested that extraditable crimes be defined carefully and political offences remain unspecified. Mr. Cornwallis pointed out that, if the Najd Government desired the Iraq Govern ment to return the Najdi tribes which had crossed the frontier owing to dissatisfaction with their Government but without com mitting a crime, a modification of Article 4 of the Bahra Agreemen would be necessary in view of the fact that in that Article tie use48 of force for the expulsion of non-criminals was specifically forbidden. The Najd delegates for some time appeared unable to understand this point. They continued to reiterate that they desired the extra dition of tribes crossing the frontier without having committed a crime, but denied that any modification of the Bahra Agreement was necessary. On the whole it appeared that they had not prepared themselves on this subject and were not in agreement with one another. The point was eventually postponed to a subsequent meeting. \\ ith regard to the case of a Najdi who committed a crime in Iraq and then took refuge in 'Iraq to escape punishment by the Najd Government (or vice versa), it was agreed that an undertaking to surrender such an individual should apply to tribesmen only. Ncijdi subjects who committed offences in the towns of 'Iraq would be subject to the Iraq penal code in the usual manner. ^ . Cornwallis ^en said that he desired to draw the attention ol the iSajd delegates to a point which he considered to be of supreme importance, and that was that, at the present moment, there were several tribes whose nationality was in dispute. The' Dahamsha, for example, were a case in point. His Majesty's Government and the Iraq Government stated that they were 'Iraqis and the fact was mentioned m the Muhammara Convention. The King however claimed them as Najdis. Until such a point as this was decided,' any extradition agreement would be of no value. Dr. Damluii r f P + J 6 11 WaS true that the Muhammara Convention stated that the Amarat were 'Iraqis, the Uqair Protocol said that tnbes Mho at the time were subject to neither Government could subsequently join whichever Government they desired. Mr Cornwallis refused to admit that the Protocol covered the case of the Dahamsha. Shaikh Fuad Hamza stated that the minutes of the PrOVe( ? t 1 hat 1 the Protoc ol in question was framed Stho^t nrnT CaSe D ahamsha. A lengthy debate ensued that the 'Trin^ 111 ^ ^ e ® men ^* The Najd delegates claimed wereNaiHk^? ^ 1 0vernment had tacitl y admitted that the Dahamsha al T^irld fnHH 1 ^ 7 T' during the COurse of the Muhhamad DaLmshacasr^L 611 ^ f* 3 ^ he ^ brou g ht fOTWard the The Shammar V f exam P 0 difficulties to be encountered.

The atmosphere became slightly heated, the Najd delegates accusing the 'Iraq Government of neglecting to fulfil its obligations in preventing the Shammar from raiding Najd. Shaikh Yusuf Yasin declared that a fresh raid by Laibal Maij of the Shammar refugees had taken place only a few days ago. Mr. Cornwallis stated, however, that the 'Iraq Government would not oppose the return to Najd of any of the Shammar refugees who desired to go. Finally, Shakh Fuad Hamza inquired whether the 'Iraq Government were prepared to admit that the Shammar were Najdis, as laid down in the Muhammara Convention. Mr. Cornwallis replied that they appeared to have dual nationality, an eventuality by no means rare. The case was eventually dropped without reaching any conclusion. The Najd delegates then requested the 'Iraq delegates to put forward their proposals for the extradition agreement. Mr. Cornwallis replied that, though he considered the conclusion of such an agreement to be of the first importance, he thought it necessary to settle the nationality questions before any extradition arrangement could be made. It was eventually agreed, however, that the extradition of ordinary criminals should be considered at the next meeting. The meeting then adjourned. Second Meeting. 8.30 a.m., 10th May, 1928. Present : Mr. Cornwallis. Captain Glubb. Flight-Lieutenant Moore, Dr. Abdullah Damluji. Shaikh Yusuf Yasin. Shaikh Hafez Wahba, Shaikh Fuad Hamza. 1. Mr. Cornwallis asked whether the Najd delegates had decided on their proposals regarding the crossing of the frontier by tribes not in possession of permits from their Governments. Shaikh Hafez Wahba replied, asking the 'Iraq delegates to put forward their suggestions first. Mr. Cornwallis said that as it was the Najd Government who requested this arrangement it was therefore incum bent upon them to explain their wishes. Dr. Damluji answered that, in the event of individuals or a tribe crossing the frontier without the permission of their Government but having committed no specific crime, the Najd Government did not desire their forcible return. Shaikh Hafez Wahba intervened by saying that the Najd Govern ment was particularly anxious not to make any modifications in50 the Bahra Treaty. Frequent changes in treaties already concluded he said, would create an atmosphere of instability. Mr. Cornwallis then inquired whether the Najd Government still required the extradition of subjects of one Government who had committed a crime m the territory of the other. Dr. Damluji replied that the inclusion of such incidents was essential. A draft Extradition Agreement was then handed by the 'Iraq delegates to the Naid delegates. The latter requested postponement of a detailed discus sion of the draft until they had had time to study it. Shaikh Fuad inquired whether attempts on the lives of the sovereigns of either Government would be regarded as political offences. The 'Iraq delegates replied that it might be possible to exclude them from that ca egory. ] aikh Fuad then asked whether a conspiracy against the existing form of Government would be classed as a political crime. A prolonged discussion ensued as to the definition of a conspiracy and of a political offence, without reaching any conclusion. Ww C0rnWalll i asked the Na j d ^legates if they desired to put ' W, ffi 117 ! ^ ^ CaSeS 0f infrin g em ent of the Najd frontier by Iraq officials or of correspondence with Najd shaikhs.

The Najd delegates raised no objection at the time to this suggestion, but Dr. Damluji said that it would be impossible for a senior official from Najd to live in the frontier area owing to the absence of any suitable town or village as his headquarters. Such a man could not be asked to live all the year round in a tent. 3. The subject of compensation and the return of loot was then raised by Shaikh Hafez Wahba. Both parties agreed that all claims had been buried prior to the date of the exchange of letters on the subject in the autumn of 1927 between King Ibn Sa'ud and the High Commissioner for 'Iraq. He inquired whether the 'Iraq Government had any claims to put forward subsequent to the date of the letter in question. Mr. Cornwallis replied that they had. The Najd delegates then stated that they had themselves very large claims, both for individuals killed by aeroplanes, notably at al-Saffa r and also for moral damages. It was agreed that discussion of the question should be postponed for the moment. It was finally agreed that the Najd delegates at the next meeting should submit a counter- draft for an extradition agreement, together with their suggestions regarding political offences, and that the 'Iraq delegates at the next meeting should submit their proposals for the improvement of frontier relations, including the suggested appointment of frontier officials by both parties. The meeting adjourned. Third Meeting. 9.15 a.m., Wth May, 1928. Present : Mr. Cornwallis. Captain Glubb. Flight-Lieutenant Moore. Dr. Abdullah Damluji. Shaikh Yusuf Yasin. Shaikh Fuad Hamza. Dr. Damluji opened the meeting by stating that the first important question which he wished to discuss was that of a Najd tribe who, after raiding in 'Iraq and returning to Najd, subsequently escaped52 into 'Iraq to avoid punishment by the Najd Government. Mr. Cornwallis pointed out that a special agreement would be necessary since such a case could not be included in an extradition agreement. The Najd delegates desired, however, that this case should be provided for in the extradition agreement. All parties agreed that an arrangement for the expulsion of such an individual was necessary, but opinion differed as to whether or not it could be included in the extradition agreement. Mr. Cornwallis then drew the attention of the Najd delegates to the telegram from the 'Iraq Government promising not to afford asylum to Faisal al-Dawish, in which the word ' expulsion ' had been employed. He inquired whether the Najd Government proposed expulsion or surrender to the Govern ment concerned. A debate on the possibilities of the surrendering of such tribes ensued. Shaikh Fuad Hamza then wrote out a draft formula, a copy of wiiich was taken by the 'Iraq delegates. In this draft the offences in question were described as ' raiding or any other crime.' Mr. Cornwallis pointed out that Article 1 of the Bahra Agreement, which Shaikh Fuad stated that this agreement was intended to implement, referred to raiding only. It was decided that both parties should consider the draft agreement further. 2. The Najd delegates here, in the course of conversation, suddenly stated that the Dafir were now Najdis. Mr. Cornwallis protested. The Najd delegates replied that they were merely imitating the 'Iraq Government, who had suddenly claimed the Shammar refugees to be 'Iraqis. If they adhered to this attitude the Najd Government would claim the Dafir as Najdis. 3. Dr. Damluji then opened the subject of political offences. He stated that the insertion of a reference to political offenders introduced an element of vagueness which would permit either Government to refuse extradition under the plea that the criminal was a political offender. He suggested that all reference to political offences be omitted in the agreement in view of the fact that tribes men to whom the agreement referred never in practice committed political offences. Mr. Cornwallis replied that the extradition agree ment was drafted to include townsmen as well as tribesmen. He was certain that neither His Majesty's Government nor the 'Iraq Government would agree to the omission of the clause. He suggested, however, that it might be possible to consider the exclusion of certain crimes, when committed by tribesmen, from the category of political offences. He quoted as an example the provisional Iraq-Syrian Extradition Agreement. Dr. Damluji stated that, at the Kuwait Conference, Colonel Knox had ruled that Shammar refugees who raided into Najd were committing a political offence. Shaikh Yusuf suggested that separate provision be made for tribesmen and townsmen, in the latter case only political offences being mentioned. It was agreed that both delegations should consider the question further and submit proposals. Mr. Cornwallis invited53 1 as e the Najd delegates to submit any other suggested modifications in the 'Iraq draft extradition agreement. They replied that they would submit all their suggested modifications together with their proposals regarding political offenders. 4. Mr. Cornwallis then invited the views of the Najd delegates on the 'Iraq proposal for the establishment of frontier commissioners. Dr. Damluji replied that the King has appointed Ibn Musa'id and Ibn Jeluwi to correspond with the 'Iraq authorities regarding the affairs of their respective provinces, and considered that that was sufficient. He added that the King himself was the final authority and that communications from the 'Iraq Government should be addressed through Jedda to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He did not consider that a special commissioner on the frontier would be of any value. Mr. Cornwallis replied that the arrangements mentioned .by Dr. Damluji were already in force and had failed obviously to secure satisfactory relations. He stated that the proposal for frontier commissioners was a sign of the openness and good will of the 'Iraq delegates. He had proposed it for that reason but was fully ready to consider any other proposal, such as the establishment of a joint post in the neutral area, which would lead to an improvement in the relations between the two countries. He was convinced that only by the closest personal co-operation between officials on the spot could peace be attained, and a stop put to the present habit of the tribes to play one Government off against the other. Dr. Damluji replied that a commissioner on the frontier would have to be an official of considerable standing, and it was impossible to expect such an individual to live in tents in the desert without any of the amenities of life. On the other hand a junior official not having sufficient authority would be of no value. Shaikh Yusuf intervened, stating that the proposal was good from a theoretical point of view, but was not practical. When, he said, the Najd Government were satisfied with the good intentions of the 'Iraq Government the proposal might be considered. So long as cars and aeroplanes continued to behave as they had the Najd Government could not agree. Captain Glubb suggested that if the Najd Government objected to the presence of motor-cars at such a meeting their representative could come on a camel. This, however, did not appear to weigh with them. 5. Shaikh Fuad then said that this proposal was only one of many other frontier problems which required definition, such, for example, as the mingling of the officials of one Government with the tribes subject to the other. An arrangement might also be made for the regular exchange of communications. Mr. Cornwallis then drew attention to an ambiguity in Article 5 of the Bahra Agreement. If, for example, an 'Iraq tribe were to enter Najd, he asked, could not the Najd Government communicate or mix with them. Dr. Damluji answered that, in such a case, the Najd Government would54 be entitled to tax, communicate with, or visit the tribe in question, who would automatically come under the laws of Najd, but not to discuss political matters with them. The Traq Government would be in a similar position with regard to a Najd tribe visiting 'Iraq. 6. Mr. Cornwallis, in reply to a question, stated that the 'Iraq Government had a list of claims to put forward. Dr. Damluji said that the Najd Government had claims but that it had not prepared an actual list and did not intend to press the point unless the Traq Government did so. If they did, howevei, the Najd Government would then put forward claims which would undoubtedly be greater than those submitted by Traq. He insisted that the Traq Government send their claims first and allow the Najd delegates to study the list before submitting their counter-claims. Mr. Cornwallis did not agree and pressed for a simultaneous exchange of claims. 7. Shaikh Fuad then inquired the views of the Traq delegates regarding the tribunal referred to in the Bahra Agreement. He said that he desired to formulate the general procedure for settlement ol claims in the future, not with particular reference to the present demands. Mr. CornwaUis replied that in his opinion the frontier commissioners proposed by him would normally be able to settle such claims also. Shaikh Fuad answered that in that case it would be necessary to amend Article 2 of the Bahra Agreement. Mr. CornwaU 18 admitted that the frontier commissioners would probably be unable to settle large claims. Shaikh Fuad then expatiated on the difficulty experienced in settling the claims by tHbunais in the past. It had been twice attempted between Najd and Trans-Jordan without success. The King, he stated, had suggested to the High Commissioner for Traq two principles. hirst, that each Government should certify the reliability of the witnesses which they put forward. Secondly, should the reliability o a \\i ness e questioned, a certificate of his reliability from his Sh ,TV d be aCCepted as efficient. Mr. Cornwallis rphflhl h W il a would r ha PP en ^ two witnesses, each certified as Canfin ri 0Wn G °™ ments ' wer e to give conflicting evidence. • P * su §S es e d that in the event of the evidence being insufficient to prove a case, reference should finally be made to a latent thfnH ^ ^ The Na j d del ^tes refused the derkion n f f e ? ^ Shaikh Fuad inquired whether the decision of a court of arbitration to settle claims should be given unanimously or by majority. A discussion ensued without reaching h^lTo Tr. ^ agreed that the Na id delegates subject. a n0te embod y in g th eir suggestions on the The meeting adjourned.55 Fourth Meeting. % 9.15 a.m., 12th May, 1928. Present : Mr. Cornwallis. Captain Glubb. Flight-Lieutenant Moore. Dr. Abdullah Damluji. Shaikh Yusuf Yasin. Shaikh Hafez Wahba. Shaikh Fuad Hamza. • 1. It was agreed to discuss the extradition agreement. Dr. Damluji stated that at the last meeting it had been agreed to define political offences. It had also been agreed that no offence committed by tribesmen should be reckoned a political crime. Mr. Cornwallis replied that he had said that raids, robbery and such like crimes were normally non-political offences. Shaikh Fuad, however, desired it to be admitted that whatever crimes were committed by tribesmen they should not be regarded as political offenders. Mr. Cornwallis differed, stating that it was possible that tribesmen might commit a political offence. There appeared to have been a misunderstanding on this subject at the last meeting. The Najd delegates explained that they wished to differentiate between tribesmen and townsmen. In the case of the latter, they would agree, in view of the insistence of the 'Iraq delegates, that political offences be excluded from extradition, but they desired it to be stated that in the case of tribesmen no crime committed by them should be considered political. Mr. Cornwallis pointed out that such a differentiation might lead to difficulties in deciding whether a particular individual was actually a tribesman or a towns man. The Najd delegates did not appear to foresee much difficulty under this head. Mr. Cornwallis reiterated that the Najd proposal that tribes could not commit political offences was too sweeping, and would not be agreed to by the 'Iraq Government. Shaikh Hafez suggested that it might be agreed that crimes committed in the frontier area were non-political, but his colleagues appeared to differ. Mr. Cornwallis suggested as his personal opinion that the following sentence might be added at the end of Article 3 of the Iraq draft extradition agreement : 'the above-mentioned offences if com mitted by tribesmen against individuals or the Government for whatever motive shall not be considered to be political offences,' or, alternatively, that a formula might be drafted on the lines of Article 4 of the Provisional Agreement for the Extradition of Offenders between 'Iraq and Syria. Shaikh Yusuf expressed himself quite convinced that no suitable arrangement could be reached unless special conditions were made for tribesmen as apart from56 townsmen. Mr. Cornwallis pointed out that his position was far more difficult than that of the Najd delegation in view of the fact that any agreement made would in 'Iraq have to remain subject to the approval of Parliament. Although he, personally, might agree with the suggestion of the Najd representatives, there was no use his doing so if he considered it unlikely that the 'Iraq Parliament would ratify the agreement concluded. Shaikh Hafez proposed that Article 3 of the 'Iraq draft extradition agreement be left as it was, but the following be added : ' but crimes committed by tribesmen whether jointly or individually of whatever nature are not political crimes.' Mr. Cornwallis said that both parties appeared to be working with the same general end of controlling the tribes, but he considered a solution could best be reached by following his suggested draft, which would be more likely to be accepted by the 'Iraq Parliament than the wording put forward by the Najd delegates. Shaikh Yusuf then said that if political offenders could not be surrendered they could at least be prevented by the Govern ment in whose territory they had taken refuge from carrying on subversive propaganda against their own Government. Mr. Cornwallis agreed. Drafts put forward by Mr. Cornwallis and Shaikh Fuad Hamza for the amendment of Article 3 of the 'Iraq draft extradition agreement were then copied and exchanged. The Najd delegates after asking for an exact explanation of Article 7 of the 'Iraq draft of the extradition agreement, stated that they had no objection to it or, with the exception of Article 3, to the other Articles. 2. Shaikh \ usuf asked that political parties or newspapers in Iraq should be prevented from creating trouble against Najd. Mr. Cornwallis replied that, although political agitators could be removed or expelled the Press in 'Iraq was free. 3. The Najd delegates stated that with regard to the proposal submitted by the Iraq delegates for the appointment of frontier commissioners, the King considered that such an arrangement would merely be a source of trouble. 4. The Najd delegates stated that they proposed to put forward a draft of an agreement for the insurance of better neighbourly rfalions winch would contain a clause in the sense of Article 2 0 ^ 10 Treaty of Jedda. Mr. Cornwallis stated his readiness to study the draft unofficially, and said he felt sure that the 'Iraq Government would agree to the policy set forth in the clause mentioned.57 Fifth Meeting. 10.45 a.m., 14th May, 1928. Present : Mr. Cornwallis. Captain Glubb. Dr. Abdullah Damluji. Shaikh Yusuf Yasin. Shaikh Hafez Wahba. Shaikh Fuad Hamza. It was decided to discuss in detail the draft agreement of Bon Voisinage put forward by the Najd delegates. Mr. Cornwallis first made it clear that he had no authority either to discuss or conclude a new treaty or agreement, but that he was willing to consider privately and unofficially the suggestions put forward by the Najd delegates. The latter expressed their disappointment at this statement, stating that they had hoped to conclude, once and for all, first the dispute regarding the building of forts, secondly, the treaty of Bon Voisinage, and, thirdly, an extradition agreement. Discussing the preamble to the draft agreement, the Najd delegates expressed their wish that the agreement be signe y His Majesty's Government on behalf of 'Iraq, or, were this impossible, that it be made a tri-partite agreement. They emphasized tie fact that the Government of 'Iraq had not acknowledged the new title of Ibn Sa'ud as King of the Hejaz and of Najd and its Dependencies. Mr. Cornwallis replied that he did not think was feasible for His Majesty's Government to conclude z imzty on behalf of 'Iraq. He was unable to say whether a tn-partite ag e ment would be possible or, alternatively, a treaty betwe ^ and 'Iraq to which His Majesty's Government would S1 ^y agreement by an exchange of notes. He was unable to make a pronouncement regarding the acknowledgmen o e &amp; title as the subject had never been raised with the Iraq Government. Article 1 of the draft agreement was read. Mr. Cornwallis squired whether in the event of the 'Iraq Government appointing a consul his headquarters would be in Jedda. The Najd df gates ^hed in the affirmative. Mr. Cornwallis stated that he was ™able to say whether the 'Iraq Government would agree to the appoint of consuls. Article 2. —Mr. Cornwallis drew attention t0 f f ^ Treaty of Jedda, on which Article 2 of the P res « nt „• Maiest y no mention had been made of subjects protected by His MajestyI 58 the King of Hejaz and of Najd and its Dependencies. Shaikh Fuad replied that when the Treaty of Jedda was signed the province of Asir was not under the protection of His Majesty.* Article 3. —At Mr. Cornwallis' suggestion, it was agreed to substitute the wording of Article 2 of the Treaty of Jedda and to add at the end of the Article the following words ' and prevent individuals engaged in such unlawful activities from crossing the frontier.' It was also agreed to add after the words ' unlawful activities ' (in the text of Article 2 of the Treaty of Jedda) the words ' including raiding and preparations therefor.' Article 4. It was agreed to omit the words ' by such means as is agreed upon ' and in lieu of the words ' with the object of attacking the frontier area substitute ' with the object of committing any of the unlawful activities mentioned in Article 3 of Article 5. —A new draft was agreed upon. Article 6. It was decided to omit this Article completely, as the case referred to therein most obviously came under the terms of the extradition agreement. Article /.-—ThLs Article was not discussed, the subject resting ^ 1 ^ir Gilbert Clayton and the King. Mr. Cornwallis suggested that Articles 7, 8, and 9, being merely elucidations of the Bahra Agreement, should be recorded in an exchange of notes and not by mserhon m the proposed agreement. With regard to the British .Forces, Mr. Cornwallis said that the 'Iraq Government could not give an undertaking concerning them, but that he thought that Mis Majesty s Government would be willing to signify by letter a ie provisions of this Article should be binding also on aerial orces. e Najd delegates saw no objection to this procedure. Article 10 was then discussed. Mr. Cornwallis said that this Article was identical with the procedure already in force. The i aj e ega es agreed, but stated that they would like the present arrangemen to be confirmed in this manner by its inclusion in the agreement. The Iraq delegates pointed out that if the channels o correspondence^ were mentioned in detail in an agreement it would be impossible subsequently to vary them without altering j 16 a f ee , m ^ ' ^ neu draft of Article 10 was then adopted to 10 e ec la correspondence should only take place between c lannels of communication to be agreed upon from time to time between the two Governments. recoSitd Thn t S - ta ^ ment 0f f ! ct - The Treat y of Mecca in wWch the Idrisi _ ognised Ibn Sa ud s suzerainty over Asir was concluded in October 1926, some seven months before the conclusion of the Treaty of Jed^-G.C.59 Sixth Meeting. 10 a.m., 15th May, 1928. Present: Mr. Cornwallis. Captain Glubb. Dr. Abdullah Damluji. Shaikh Yusuf Yasin. Shaikh Fuad Hamza. The discussion of the Bon Voisinage Agreement was resumed where it had been left off at the last meeting. It was agreed to omit the word ' rasmiyih' after the word ' muwazzafin.' It was agreed to substitute for the word ' fursanan' the word ' rukbanan.' Mr. Cornwallis stated that he presumed that the words ' from crossing the frontier or ihixing with the tribes ' meant mixing with tribes in the country of the other party only. The Najd delegates replied that that was of course the meaning. Article 12. —It was agreed to omit the words ' ghair al-rasmiyih ^ and to add after the word ' al muqimin ' the words ' au al-qadimin.' It was decided to add at the end of the Article on the understanding that tribal movements are subject to the terms of the Bahra Agreement.' This concluded the discussion on the draft Article by Article. The Najd delegates again emphasized their desire that His Majesty's Government be a party to the agreement. Dr. Damluji suggested three courses ; First, that the agreement be concluded between Najd and His Majesty's Government alone, the latter representing 'Iraq; secondly, that the agreement be tri-partite ; thirdly, that the agreement be concluded between Iraq and Isajd, His Majesty s Government signifying their concurrence by an exchange of notes. Shaikh Yusuf intervened by stating that His Majesty's Government should not only signify their concurrence but also their responsibility for its execution. The Najd delegates, in conclusion, requested the 'Iraq representatives to discuss this question with Sir Gilbert Clayton. The Naid draft extradition agreement was then discussed. Article 1 of the Najd draft had omitted the specification that only 'Iraq and Najd nationals could be extradited. The Najd delegates stated that the omission was intentional, and that it was essential that all persons of whatever nationality be made subject to extra dition, citing as examples Italians and Frenchmen. Mr. Cornwalhs refused to accept this view. Regarding Article 2, Mr. Cornwallis said that he was unable to comment at present.60 Regarding Article 3, he pointed out that he had already explained that such incidents could not be dealt with under an extradition agreement, but that he hoped that a separate agreement on the subject would be possible, or, alternatively, that it might be embodied in the Bon Voisinage Agreement. The Najd delegates expressed themselves as unable to understand the objection to its inclusion in the extradition agreement. They further pointed out that Mr. Cornwallis had said that he had no authority to conclude a treaty of Bon Voisinage, and hence if this clause was relegated to the treaty its conclusion might be indefinitely postponed. Shaikh Fuad went so far as to say that the Najd Government would not sign an extradition agreement which did not include this Article. Article 4. —The Najd delegates stated that their competent authority for the purposes of extradition would be the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Jedda. A discussion ensued regarding the necessity of including the last sentence of Article 5. Mr. Cornwallis said that it was universally understood that, on urgent demand from the other Government, one Government could arrest and detain an offender pending the receipt of the complete charge sheet and other extradition documents. In 'Iraq such a prisoner could be detained for three months. Article 7. The attention of the Najd delegates was drawn to the fact that in their draft they had omitted to make clear that the crimes for which an extraditable person could be tried were limited to such as he had committed before the date of his extradition. Mr. Cornwallis suggested the insertion after the words ' may not be tried for any crime' of the words 'committed before the date of his extradition. The Najd delegates stated that the inclusion of this phrase would render the meaning obscure in Arabic. It was decided to ask Mr. Antonius to draft an article in Arabic. Seventh Meeting. 9.30 a.m., Monday, 21st May. Present : Mr. Cornwallis. Captain Glubb. The King's four advisers. Mr Cornwams promised to present the draft Agreement of on oismage to the Iraq Government on his return to Baghdad. Ihe meeting then proceeded to discuss the Najd draft Extradition Agreement.61 Mr. Cornwallis complained that the Najd delegates had made numerous trivial alterations in the wording of their draft as compared with that submitted by the 'Iraq delegates. These alterations did not appear to involve any change in the meaning. For example, in Article 1 the phrase ' according to the provisions of this Agreement ' had been removed from the commencement of the paragraph to the second line, and the words ' nationals of Iraq who had committed offences' had been changed into ' Iraq offenders.' The Najd delegates replied that the actual wording could be agreed upon when a final agreement was reached. Article 2 was then discussed. The Najd delegates had added three additional crimes not mentioned in the 'Iraq draft. It was eventually agreed that the following crimes should be made extra ditable : ' assault, brigandage, robbery, theft of all kinds, wounding, murder, raiding.' Mr. Cornwallis then stated that the 'Iraq •Government was unable to agree to the suggestion of the Najd delegates that a clause be inserted in Article 2 stating that no crimes committed by tribesmen could be regarded as political crimes. The Najd delegates protested loudly, stating that, if the clause were omitted, a loophole would be left by which the extradition of criminals could be evaded. Mr. Cornwallis was obliged to protest strongly against the remark of Shaikh Yusuf, who stated that the 'Iraq Government would make use of such a loophole to evade its obligations. The Najd delegates then asked whether a clause could be inserted stating that the crime of raiding was non-political. Mr. Cornwallis was unable to agree to this either. He then read out a telegram from the 'Iraq Government to himself stating that it was impossible to agree to the Najd proposal. He added, however, that at the first meeting of the sub-committee he had asked the Najd delegates whether they desired that tribes which crossed the frontier without permits from their own Governments and without committing crimes should be returned to their country of origin. He pointed out that although a clause undertaking to extradite all tribal criminals whatever the motive of the offences could not be agreed to in an extradition treaty yet it was possible, if the question of the disputed tribes was settled satisfactorily, that an agreement by which the Governments undertook to return tribes which crossed the frontier without permits could be made to serve the end desired by the Najd Government. When the proposal had been mooted at the first sub-committee meeting, the Najd delegates had said that they desired it, but at the second meeting they had^ changed their opinion. Shaikh Fuad replied that the reason why they had abandoned the proposal was because its conclusion would involve an alteration in the Bahra Agreement, because the words ' other than expulsion and the use of force would have to e omitted from Article 4. The Najd delegates were anxious not to change anything in the Bahra Agreement. Mr. Cornwallis then62 said that he was not authorised in any case to make this proposal officially, but he had just mentioned it as a possible solution of the difficulty in the future. Article 4. —The Najd delegates stated that the authorities con cerned mentioned in Article 4 were the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Jedda. Mr. Cornwallis said that in that case the proper authorities in 'Iraq would probably also be the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Baghdad. A fresh draft for the last sentence in Article 5 of the Najd draft was then agreed upon, and is attached to the minutes. Article 6. —Mr. Cornwallis requested the omission of the words ' or tribe ' and the insertion of the words ' under this agreement,' as in the original 'Iraq draft. The Najd draft of Article 7 was agreed to. With regard to the question of extradition expenses, the Najd delegates appeared to be of the opinion that no claims for expenses should be allowed. As regards Article 3 of the Najd draft, Mr. Cornwallis stated that he was unable to agree to its insertion in the extradition agreement, but that Sir Gilbert Clayton would hand a letter on the subject to the King.63 ANNEXURE 3. MEMORANDUM ON THE PROPOSED ARBITRATION BETWEEN NAJD AND TRANS-JORDAN. I. —Memorandum by Mr. Antonius on Matters Relating to Trans-Jordan. The questions affecting Trans-Jordan were discussed in committee between me and the King's principal advisers. Eight meetings were held between the 18th and the 24th May, and the questions which formed the subject of discussion were [a] The proposed appointment of a British arbitrator to adjudicate on the claims in respect of past raids. (&amp;) The proposed appointment of a permanent Raids Officer, (c) The conclusion of Extradition and Bon Voisinage Agreements between Najd and irans-Jordan. 2. With regard to [a), the King's advisers presented at the opening meeting a rough draft of what they considered should be the qualifica tions of the arbitrator and his terms of reference. There were several clauses in that document which seemed to me open o objection, and I endeavoured in the meetings which o owe o arrive at an agreement over them. Eventually, agreement was reached on all points except one, and the King's advisers withdrew their first draft and presented another, of which a summary is attached to this memorandum. The contents of this second dra seem to me to be fair to both sides and acceptab e, save or e provisions of Clause 5. • x n c 3. The King's advisers laid great stress on the insertion of Clause 5 and to the last they stated that it was the King s that should form an essential condition of the propose ar i . It was obvious that the motive behind the s ^istence was his fear lest the Trans-Jordan Government mig pu claims before the arbitrator, as had been the case a of the Jericho Court. I pointed out that the inclus f ^ S clause was both unnecessary an ^. ^ m P r0 P er ', i , • ^ ir anv because it was obvious that the arbitrator wou im i mt)roD er claim which was not adequately substan + tl l ed ' • a f n ^XrS because it limited the arbitrator s discretion o ® P, x rans _ Wdan him from examining a category of claims w ic /- ourt After Government had formally submitted to e J 6 , 1 ? Kind's advisers reference to Sir Gilbert Clayton, I informed ^ Kmg s f visers that he was not prepared to accept the clause cMt was amounted in effect to a pre-judgment of tie very proposed to submit to arbitration. +1^ 4. The King maintained his in fwas adopted clause, and his advisers informed me64 he could not see his way to submitting to the proposed arbitration. Matters were left there when we concluded our sittings, and as by that time the negotiations between Sir Gilbert Clayton and His Majesty had led to a suspension of the conversations, it was agreed that the discussion of these subsidiary questions be similarly suspended, and referred to the High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan for his views. 5. When the matter was subsequently discussed at a conference in Jerusalem, Lord Plumer and Colonel Cox both expressed the view that the stipulation contained in that clause was unacceptable. It looks, therefore, as if the resumption of negotiations with the King was bound to lead to a deadlock on that point, and to an abandonment of the proposed arbitration. I think it fairly certain that the King will adhere to his insistence on the retention of Clause 5. 6. It may be possible, however, to overcome the difficulty by altering the form of the agreement to be arrived at prior to the appointment of the arbitrator, and to express it in the form of an exchange of notes rather than in a convention of the form proposed by the King s advisers. In that case, Sir Gilbert Clayton would address an identical note to each of the Governments of Najd and Trans-Jordan, proposing the appointment of an arbitrator on the conditions outlined in the Najd draft with the exception of Clause 5, and containing in the place of Clause 5 an assurance to the effect that the King s views on the subject of unregistered claims would be fully communicated to, and carefully considered by, the arbitrator. The assurance could be so worded as to set the King's apprehensions at rest and at the same time safeguard the rights of the Trans-Jordan Government to a fair hearing. 7. With regard to [h), it was agreed that a decision on this question should wait upon the decision to be arrived at with regard to the appointment of an arbitrator, and that, in the event of the proposed arbitration materialising, the appointment of a permanent Raids Officer would not come into effect until after the liquidation of past raids, * 8. With regard to (c), discussions did not progress beyond the stage of a tentative examination. The drafts of the proposed Extradition and Bon V oisinage Agreements which it was con templated might be concluded between Najd and 'Iraq were examined with a view to their possible conclusion as between Najd Trans-Jordan. I made certain observations on the proposed drafts, from the point of view of Irans-Jordan interests. In particular, I pointed out that the insistence of the Najd Government on distinguishing between crimes committed by tribesmen and crimes committed by settled individuals was open, so far as65 concerned Trans-Jordan, to a practical objection which might prove insuperable, namely, that in many cases it would be difficult in practice to draw a hard-and-fast line between tribesmen and settled inhabitants. But I made it quite clear to the King's advisers that, although the proposal to conclude agreements of that nature was one which would be welcomed by the Trans-Jordan Government, I was not in a position to express any binding opinion until the matter had been submitted to the High Commissioner for Trans- Jordan and his instructions obtained. I also informed them that their proposals would be duly submitted to the High Commissioner through the proper channels. (Initialed) G. A. II.—Draft Terms of Reference for the Proposed Arbitration between Najd and Trans-Jordan. 1.

I.—From Sir G. Clayton. Jedda, 23rd May, 1928. His Majesty, 'Abdul-'Aziz ibn 'Abdul-Rahman al-Faisal al-Sa'ud, King of the Hejaz and of Najd and its Dependencies. Your Majesty, I have the honour to confirm the agreement arrived at verbally between us with regard to the suspension of our conversations, which has been rendered necessary by the advent of the pilgrimage season. I have informed Your Majesty that I am taking advantage of this unavoidable interruption to return to London and acquaint His Majesty's Government with the progress of our conversations. It is agreed that, until conversations are resumed or broken off, all parties concerned will endeavour to maintain peace and tranquillity on the Najd-Traq border ; and that the Governments of these two countries will not only abstain from taking any hostile or offensive action, but will also use their best endeavours to prevent any act on the part of any of their subjects of a nature to cause dissension between the two countries. Further, it is agreed that should tribal attacks or any other untoward incident occur in either country, instant communication is to be established between the two Governments with a view to the taking of such concerted measures as the best interests of peace might dictate. On behalf of His Majesty's Government, I am in a position to assure Your Majesty that His Majesty's Government will endeavour to the best of their ability to co-operate with the 'Iraq Government towards the achievement of the object described above, and will expect the Government of Najd likewise to do their utmost to maintain peace between the two countries and security on the border, which it is undoubtedly in the interests of all parties concerned to maintain. Although I am unable to fix a date for the resumption of our negotiations, yet I have noted Your Majesty's statement concerning the necessity of your returning to Najd at the end of Safar next {i.e., about the middle of August next) and of regarding that date as the latest limit for the resumption or rupture of our negotiations.(g) 67 I shall therefore do my best to acquaint His Majesty's Government with the realities of your position in detail, and point out to them that it is in the interests of both parties to bring the negotiations to a conclusion as soon as possible, especially as the date mentioned above sets a limit to the period during which our present temporary arrangement can take effect. I beg that Your Majesty will be pleased to accept the expression of my highest respect and consideration. Gilbert Clayton. His Britannic Majesty's Commissioner and Plenipotentiary.

Jedda. 22nd May, 1928. His Majesty, 'Abdul-'Aziz ibn 'Abdul-Rahman al-Faisal al-Sa'ud, King of the Hejaz and of Najd and its Dependencies, Your Majesty, I have the honour to inform you that Your Majesty s advisers called on me this morning and informed me verbally that news was received yesterdav to the effect that certain cars and aeroplanes from 'Iraq had crossed the Najd frontier, that the occupants of the cars had tried to induce certain tribesmen to migrate into 'Iraq, and that the aeroplanes had dropped bombs over Najd territory, between the 6th and 10th Zul-Qa'da (25th-29th April). They also informed me that Your Majesty had received the news with the greatest surprise and regret, that you regard these incidents as a negation of the spirit which has animated our negotiations and that you had ordered them to convey to me an expression of strong protest on the part of Your Majesty. In reply, I would beg Your Majesty to believe that my surprise and regret at the reception of this news are not less than Your Majesty's, and that I cannot but agree with Your Majesty in thinking that any such incidents would be completely contrary to the spirit in which I was instructed by His Majesty's Government to enter into negotiations with Your Majesty. I consider it my duty to report the matter at once by telegram with a request for an early reply, in the hope that I may be in a position to send Your Majesty a further communication on this matter before leaving Jedda this week. I beg that Your Majesty will be pleased to accept the expression of my highest respect and consideration. Gilbert Clayton, His Britannic Majesty's Commissioner and Plenipotentiary.79 II.—Letter from the King of the Hejaz. Jedda. 3rd Zul-Hejja, 1346. (22nd May, 1928.) {Translation.) From 'Abdul-'Aziz ibn 'Abdul-Rahman al-Faisal al-Sa'ud. To Sir Gilbert Clayton, H.B.M. Commissioner and Plenipotentiary. Your Excellency, Greetings. We wish to inform you that we have to-day received from our Governor at Hail regrettable news of the occurrence of fresh incidents on the frontier, caused by motor-cars and aeroplanes from 'Iraq, at a time when it had been agreed between us and the British Government that a conference should be held with a view to discussing, in a friendly and cordial spirit, the various questions which have occasioned similar incidents on the frontier. It is a matter for deep regret that, even as you were on your way from London to meet us, carrying with you the promise of peace and a desire to come to an understanding, certain persons who do not appreciate the realities of the situation and do not desire the maintenance of friendship and good understanding were proceeding once again to violate the sanctity of Treaties and Agreements, and were permitting themselves and the officials attached to them to intrude upon the independence of Najd and cross her frontiers in cars and aeroplanes—a proceeding which no international usage or humanitarian principle or treaty obligations can warrant. The particulars of those incidents are as follows :— (i) About the time of our departure from the Qasim, in the early days of Zul-Oe'da {i.e., about the last week of April), eight cars came to the camping-grounds of the inhabitants of Aiwej, in the neighbourhood of Lina, and their occupants entered into conversation with Najdi tribes encamped at that spot, on the subject of their crossing over into 'Iraq territory. The cars made a stay of two days, during which the occupants kept trying to persuade the tribes, but their efforts did not meet with success. (ii) Five days later three aeroplanes circled and dropped bombs over Lina and Sal Lina. One of the machines made a forced landing, but none of our tribesmen went near it in spite of the fact that it had committed an act of aggression on them. Ihe two other machines flew back to their base, and subsequently returned in an endeavour to repair the damaged aeroplane ; but, having failed to do so, they set fire to it.80 (iii) A few days previously, other aeroplanes had flown over the Bashuk area repeatedly. In face of this series of acts of aggression on the part of the 'Iraq Government we have no alternative but to reiterate our bitter protest on the following points :— (a) We strongly protest against the interference of officials with our tribes and their acts, which are contrary to the terms of Agreements in force ; (b) We protest against the crossing of our frontier by cars and aeroplanes ; (c) We protest against the bombing of our peaceful tribes by aeroplanes. Lastly, we would ask Your Excellency to report this matter to the Biitish Government and to inform them that perseverance in such conduct on the part of those in 'Iraq can only lead to evil consequences, more particularly in view of the great efforts which, as you are aware, we have displayed to pacify the people of Najd and prevent them from carrying out the intentions they harboured towards 'Iraq ; if, while we are trying by every means to allay their excitement, the 'Iraq Government demolish what we erect and pull down what we put up, what answer can we make to the people of Najd, and by what means are we to pacify them and allay their excitement ? For these reasons, we beg that a stop be put to such acts, which are sanctioned neither by usage nor by treaty nor by right. Respects. (Seal) 'Abdul-'Aziz ibn 'Abdul-Rahman al-Sa'ud. III.—Telegram from Sir Gilbert Clayton. Telegram to His Majesty's High Commissioner for 'Iraq, No. 69, dated 22.5.28. Addressed to Baghdad No. 69, repeated to Foreign Office No. 40. Following from Clayton :— Ibn Sa'ud has communicated to me following detailed and circum stantial report which he received in Mecca. First, eight cars came to Aiwij on the 25th or 26th April and tried to persuade tribes to migrate into 'Iraq. Second, aeroplanes flew over Lina on 27th or 28th April and dropped bombs. Third,81 aeroplanes flew over tribes in Bashuk area on 27th or 28th April and dropped bombs. Fourth, three aeroplanes flew to Lina on 29th April where one made a forced landing. The other two aeroplanes flew back to 'Iraq and then returned, but failing to repair machine burnt it and flew back. These proceedings were watched by a large crowd of tribesmen, who in deference to the King's strict orders took no hostile action. The King protested vehemently to me against these incidents, especially at a time when negotiations had been mutually agreed upon. Report has placed me in a most unfortunate position on the eve of my departure. I have had to send a provisional reply to the King expressing my surprise and regret at the reception of such a report and informing him that I would at once telegraph for confirmation. If the news is true or even partly so the maintenance of peace during the period of suspension will be jeopardised unless I am authorised to convey an expression of regret to the King. Cornwallis and Glubb cannot throw any light on the incidents which are alleged to have occurred on dates subsequent to their departure. Should be grateful for immediate reply which I can communicate to Ibn Sa'ud before I leave. IV—Telegram from Sir Henry Dobbs. No. 93 S. Despatched 23.5.28. Received 23.5.28. Addressed to Jedda No. 93 S, repeated to Colonial Office No. ^94. Following for Clayton (Telegram No. 40 to Foreign Office^) When news that Ibn Sa'ud consented to meet you was received, transfrontier reconnaissances were cut down to the minimum, u owing to uncertainty of his movements and leports receive ^ a c as 27th April that he was detained at Buraida and that Akhwan were obdurate I did not feel justified in stopping such i cconnaissances completely until I was certain that he had • • • , , wan 1 an r for Jedda.

Sole object of flight was to stop Dhafir raiding Mutair. (4) These incidents actually took place on 1st and 3rd May. Aeroplanes had been broken up and looted by tribesmen and therefore had to be burnt. His Majesty's Government were, I understand, aware that until it was certain that meeting with Ibn Sa'ud would take place occasional air reconnaissances over Najd territory were to continue. V.—Telegram from Sir G. Clayton. Telegram to His Majesty's High Commissioner for 'Iraq, No. 77, dated 25.5.28. Addressed to Baghdad, No. 77, repeated to Foreign Office, No. 44. Following from Clayton :— Your telegram No. 93 S noted. The information which Ibn Sa'ud has received and communicated to me appears to be substantially correct. In the present state of negotiations the explanation given does not enable me to reply satisfactorily to Ibn Sa ud s protest against violation of his frontiers, which he maintains was unprovoked and unwarranted at a time when peaceful conversations had for some time been definitely agreed upon {vide his letter of 5th April accepting my mission) and the British delegate was already on his way to Jedda. To use the explanations and arguments advanced in your above quoted telegram and in Bourdillon s letter to Cornwallis which I have opened and read would only inflame situation further. I am therefore getting out of an awkward predicament as best I can by promising to lay Ibn Sa'ud's protest before His Majesty's Government as soon as I reach London. VI.—Letter from Sir G. Clayton. Jedda. 25th May, 1928. His Majesty, 'Abdul-'Aziz ibn 'Abdul-Rahman al-Faisal al-Sa'ud, King of the Hejaz and of Najd and its Dependencies. Your Majesty, , I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter M3/27/41, dated the 3rd Zul-Hejja 1346 (22nd May, 1928), relating to the incidents on the 'Iraq frontier.83 On that date, I had the honour of addressing Your Majesty in a letter which I wrote immediately on receipt of the news communicated verbally to me by your advisers. I w ? ish now to confirm the state ments contained in my letter of the 22nd May and to repeat that I shall endeavour to send Your Majesty a further reply at an early date. My last act before leaving Jedda to-day is to write these lines which will convey to Your Majesty an expression of sincere gratitude for the kindness and hospitality which you have extended to me and the members of my Mission. For myself I venture to thank Your Majesty very sincerely for the patience and consideration which you have always shown to me and for the cordial atmosphere in which our conversations have been conducted. I wish Your Majesty all health and strength in the great task on which you are engaged. I beg that Your Majesty will be pleased to accept the expression of my highest respect and consideration. Gilbert Clayton. His Britannic Majesty's Commissioner and Plenipotentiary.84 APPENDIX. 59092/28 [No. 20 A.] Colonial Office to Sir Gilbert Clayton, K.C.M.G., K.B.E., C.B. Downing Street, 17th April, 1928. Sir, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Amery to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th of April* notifying your acceptance of the appointment of special British Representative for the purpose of negotiating a settlement of outstanding questions with His Majesty King Ibn Sa'ud. It is not the desire of His Majesty's Government to limit your discretion in regard to the manner in which the results desired by His Majesty's Government should be attained, but for your guidance and in order to assist you in the negotiations it is thought desirable to communicate to you the following information regarding the circumstances which have necessitated your mission and to state the policy of His Majesty's Government in regard to the matters which will form the subject of your conversations with His Majesty King Ibn Sa'ud. 2. The primary object of your mission will be to discuss the present critical situation between 'Iraq and Nejd, which has arisen as a result of a series of raids into 'Iraq and Koweit territory by certain Akhwan elements, and to attempt in conversation with His Majesty to liquidate this situation in such a manner as will prevent further raids of this nature upon territories with which His Majesty's Government are in treaty relations. To assist you in this part of your mission it is proposed that Mr. K. Cornwallis, C.M.G., C.B.E., D.S.O., the Adviser to the Ministry of Interior, 'Iraq, should accom pany you. He will be fully acquainted with the details of these raids, the casualties inflicted, the loss of live stock and property occasioned, and the claims for reparation therefor to be presented by the 'Iraq Government. He will also be in a position to advise you in regard to the tribal situation on the 'Iraq-Nejd frontier. It is also proposed that Mr. B. H. Bourdillon, C.M.G., the Counsellor to the High Commissioner for 'Iraq, should fly to Egypt to consult with you in regard to the conduct of this part of your mission. 3. For your information in regard to this aspect of your mission, I am to enclose a copy of a memorandum''' prepared in the Foreign Office summarising the correspondence which has passed between His Majesty King Ibn Sa'ud and the various representatives of His Majesty's Government concerned. I am also to enclose copies of statements J furnished by the High Commissioner for 'Iraq containing a summary of the communications received by him from King Ibn Sa'ud, and showing in a parallel column the action taken thereon and the replies to the complaints made in His Majesty's letters. A more complete set of correspondence with King Ibn Sa'ud, as affecting 'Iraq and Trans-Jordan, will doubtless be communicated to you by those Governments and, in so far as it has passed through Jeddah, by the British Agent and Consul at that port. Although these documents set out in full the circumstances leading up to the present situation it might be of advantage to furnish you with a brief account of the principal events which have led to the present crisis in the relations between His Majesty's Government and the King of Nejd. 4. In September of last year King Ibn Sa'ud addressed to the High Commissioner for 'Iraq a protest against the establishment by the Iraq Government of certain advanced police posts. The post to which His Majesty took principal exception was one at Busaiyah, then in course of • 59106/28 [No. I] ; not printed. t 58117/28 [No. 142] and 59068/28 [No. 198] ; not printed. t 58117/28 [Nos. 150 and 182] and 59086/28 [No. 349] ; not printed.85 construction, which provided accommodation for some 15 police. The post was situated at a distance of some 75 miles from the nearest point on the Traq-Nejd frontier. In his letter His Majesty represented that the con struction of this post was contrary to the provisions of Article 3 of the Uqair Protocol of the 2nd of December, 1922, which reads as follows :— ' The two Governments mutually agree not to use the watering places and wells situated in the vicinity of the border for any military purpose, such as building forts on them, and not to concentrate troops in their vicinity.' Some three weeks later King Ibn Sa'ud followed up this letter with a further protest. At this point it should be explained that the construction of the Busaiyah post and similar police posts at other places equally far distant from the frontier was undertaken by the 'Iraq Government in response to a previous complaint by King Ibn Sa'ud that the 'Iraq Government were permitting the refugee Shammar tribe to raid into Nejd territory through the narrow corridor connecting 'Iraq and Trans-Jordan. The 'Iraq Government hoped by the establishment of these advanced police posts to obtain early information of such raids and thus, even if unable to prevent them occurring, at least to intercept the raiders on their return and inflict salutary punishment. 5. In the latter part of October the High Commissioner replied to King Ibn Sa'ud pointing out that there was no foundation for the charge that the establishment of the Busaiyah post was a contravention of the Uqair Protocol and sending photographs and details of the post to demonstrate that, quite apart from the fact that it could not be described as in the vicinity of the border ' (it is, in fact, the same distance from the Nejd frontier as the fortified post at Rutbah on the trans-desert air and motor route), its small size and limited garrison rendered any description of it as a fort misleading. On 5th November, while this correspondence was in progress, a party of Mutair raided the Busaiyah post and slaughtered its occupants, including, in addition to the garrison of 6 police, an irrigation official, 12 coolies, and an raqi woman. After this raid there followed in quick succession a number o ur icr raids by Mutair tribesmen upon 'Iraq tribes. These raids were characterised by the utmost savagery. Strongly-worded protests were sent to King ibn Sa'ud, but these produced equivocal replies which while admitting that in carrying out these raids the leader of the Mutair, Shaikh Faisa a awis , had acted m defiance of His Majesty's instructions, represented that the fault really lay with the 'Iraq Government in constructing e po ice pos that if the police post were abandoned the raids would cease. ^ increasingly obvious that the Mutair tribe had definite y rown g Ibn Sa'ud's authority and were no longer under his effect ^ ve , this view was apparently substantiated by a warning w ic , forre conveyed to the Resident in the Persian Gulf to the effect l hat ^ of Akhwan were marching north contrary to his orders. i nno -p r Kp -inv stances. His Majesty's Government decided that there cou n &amp; Akhwan objection to the Royal Air Force in 'Iraq being aut ori s c&lt; ^ „wcnn on them, raiders across the border in order to inflict, if possible, a as ng This decision was communicated to King Ibn Sa u . 6. In the meantime, these constant Akhwan ral f d * seriously unsettling the ■ Ir ^ 1 ^ e if' Derember the High Commis- confederations in Iraq, iowaras tnc euu nrpvpnt further sioner reported that unless effective was a serious danger raids and to restore the confidence ° f . V explained that, that they would desert Iraq and jom ^ distance involved it owing to the immense stretch f rol J^ cat ch the raiders red-handed was almost impossible for British aircra terr itory and he suggested and to inflict punishment upon them within Iraqtemtory gB that, unless within a specified period King Ibn Sa ud demonstra (13548 C)86 willingness and ability to punish the raiders, a blockade of the Hasa ports should be imposed in order to bring pressure to bear on the Akhwan. His Majesty's Government were, however, unwilling to adopt so serious a step, in any case until more direct action against the guilty tribesmen had been tried and proved unsuccessful. After full consideration they decided that, in the first instance, it would be preferable to extend air action beyond the 'Iraq frontier in order to deny an area of grazing grounds to the Akhwan. Early in January and after the lapse of some two months since the initial raid had taken place, during which further raids had occurred and King Ibn Sa'ud had taken no effective measures to restrain his recalcitrant subjects, the authority for the adoption of this measure was given and King Ibn Sa'ud was notified accordingly. Advance aircraft and armoured car bases were pushed forward to the vicinity of the frontier and notices were dropped warning tribes to move out of the area which was to be denied to the Akhwan. This action, coupled with constant air reconnaissances, was sufficient to restore the confidence of the 'Iraqi tribes, and for some three weeks the raiding activities on the part of the Mutair were suspended. At the end of January, however, further raids occurred culminating in a raid upon 'Iraq and Koweit tribesmen by some 2,000 of the Akhwan who penetrated to a depth of some 65 miles. The raiders were attacked by British aircraft and are understood to have suffered severe losses. 7. King Ibn Sa'ud had hitherto endeavoured to exculpate himself and his tribes by the allegation that the 'Iraq Government had broken their treaty pledges and thus to excuse his failure to prevent the raids and to administer punishment. He now represented that the crossing of his frontier by British aeroplanes was a violation of his territory. These aeroplanes, he alleged, by bombing guilty and innocent alike had so outraged the feelings of his people that he had had to abandon measures which he had already set in motion for the control and punishment of the Mutair, his work of pacification had been destroyed and he could no longer control the feelings of his people. A com plete answer to this allegation that innocent persons have been attacked by British aircraft will be found in a telegram from Sir H. Dobbs, dated the 19th of March,* of which a copy is attached. 8. In response to this message. His Majesty's Government replied that in order to assist him to regain control and provided that His Majesty would give assurances that he would prevent further raids and would punish the offenders and exact full reparation, orders would be issued that no aircraft should cross the Nejd frontier except in hot pursuit of raiders. At the same time. His Majesty's Government repeated a suggestion previously made by them on several occasions that a meeting should be arranged between His Majesty and the British Resident in the Persian Gulf to discuss the questions in dispute. His Majesty did not accept this invitation nor did he give the assurances for which His Majesty's Government had asked, but merely reiterated his previous protests. Meanwhile, rumours became current that all the Akhwan were joining with the Mutair in a regular jihad (Holy War) against the non-Akhwan States of 'Iraq, Trans-Jordan, and Koweit, and that King Ibn Sa'ud (himself powerless to prevent it) had been forced to associate himself with this movement. Later information, however, tends to discredit these rumours, and to indicate that King Ibn Sa'ud dissociates himself from the action of the more unruly elements of the Akhwan and has been, at least temporarily, successful in detaching the important tribe of Ataibi from the movement against 'Iraq and Koweit. According to earlier rumours this tribe, together with the Ajman, had decided to join with the Mutair in attacking 'Iraq, Trans-Jordan, and Koweit. 9. Throughout his letters King Ibn Sa'ud has maintained, in the face of uncontrovertible evidence to the contrary, that the establishment of the ♦ 59086/28 [No. 259]; not printed.87 Busaiyah post and similar police posts is a contravention of the Uqair Protocol and has continued to press for its abolition as providing the only solution of the present trouble. To this His Majesty has lately added a further condition, namely, that those responsible for bombing his territory should be punished. As an example of the general tenor of King Ibn Sa ud s recent letters, I am to enclose a translation of a letter from His Majesty dated the 8th of March.* The comments of the High Commissioner for Iraq upon this letter will be found in his telegram No. 168 of the 19th of Marchf to which reference has been made in paragraph 7 above. 10. His Majesty's Government are not prepared to admit that the Iraq Government, in constructing these posts, acted otherwise than in full accord with their treaty obligations ; nor are they prepared to agree to the demolition of any of these posts. It should be realised that the interest of His Majesty s Government in the maintenance of these posts does not arise solely out o their responsibility for the defence of 'Iraq. It is ot the utmos impor a for His Majesty's Government to ensure the preservation of the autho y of the 'Iraq Government in the corridor connecting Iraq and Trans-Jo d . If Akhwan influence were allowed to penetrate into tins ar ® a ' ^ e P^ J ^^ of a pipe line and a railway from Haifa to Baghdad to which His f a esty s Government attach considerable importance, would become im P r , a h C f ^ b . ' The only apparent means of securing the maintenance of Iraq ai . | . t l b this area is by a chain of posts such as those which have been ^hshed by the 'Iraq Government, and to which King Ibn Sa ud takes s g exception. You will see, therefore, that Imperial as well as local issues are involved. Consequently, a solution on the lines propose y g t k is unacceptable, and it Remains to consider what other in order to provide a satisfactory settlement of t le ma raidin 0 -' and the which will offer good prospects of the cessation of furt ^ r ^ lding anC establishment of settled conditions on the Iraq ej Doubtless, a full and frank discussion of questions m ^ yourself and King Ibn Sa'ud will go far to convince establishment of the is not already convinced) that his protests agams^ action of the 'Iraq Busaiyah post were unjustified and that m which may b e reached Government has been correct but if any , s own ition v i s a vis his is to be lasting the question of Kmg lbn ^ considered satisfactory tribes cannot be ignored.

The dispute, ostensibly at least, ^ArticteS of interpretation of the words in the v i C11 - ti it is essential that some the Uqair Protocol. In the interests of bot h P a ™ es £ ^ hrase and thus means should be found of removing t e a g ad option of an accepted eliminating the possibility of be defineS as definition.

In a letter dated the 25th of January, and addressed to His Majesty's Agent and Consul at Jeddah, King Ibn Sa'ud stated that, in deference to the stipulations of Article 3 of the Uqair Protocol he had forbidden his tribes to build a fortified post at Linah, which is situated more than 30 miles from the 'Iraq frontier. It seems possible that, by encouraging His Majesty to exercise his undoubted right to construct a chain of Nejdi posts outside the prohibited zone on his side of the frontier the reciprocal nature of the arrange ment would be made evident and any appearance of surrender on the part of His Majesty would be removed. With the same object in view the 'Iraq Government have suggested that His Majesty might be encouraged to co-operate with them in the establishment of a joint post to be manned by Nejdi and 'Iraqi contingents in the neutral zone. You will doubtless put forward these suggestions, if you consider them likely to be acceptable to King Ibn Sa'ud, when a favourable opportunity occurs. In the unlikely event of King Ibn Sa'ud proving wholly intractable and your falling to move him by argument, you may, if you see fit, indicate to him, in such manner as you may deem appropriate, that, unless some satis factory settlement is reached which will ensure peaceful conditions on the frontiers of Iraq and Koweit, His Majesty's Government may be compelled to bring further pressure to bear upon the guilty tribes either directly or indirectly through the medium of a blockade of the Persian Gulf ports. In this connection I am to enclose copies of telegrams from which it appears that King Ibn Sa ud is fully alive to the latter possibility and is anxious to avoid it. If it becomes evident that there can be no satisfactory outcome from your conversations with His Majesty and that their continuance would serve no useful purpose, you should report accordingly to His Majesty's Government and await instructions, in the meantime suspending discussions. It is not the wish of His Majesty's Government that the negotiations should be definitely broken off while there remains any prospect of a successful issue or without prior reference to London. 13. Mr. Cornwallis will be in a position to furnish you with details of the claims of the 'Iraq Government to reparation for the recent Akhwan raids. \ ou should endeavour to obtain from King Ibn Sa'ud an undertaking to satisfy these claims after due investigation and indeed any settlement with His Majesty which does not contain provision for the liquidation of these claims, and for the punishment of his guilty tribesmen, would not be acceptable. 14. In a letter,* a copy of which is enclosed, dated the 6th of December, addressed to His Majesty s High Commissioner for Kgypt and presented by Shaikh Hafez W ahba. His Majesty suggested that a special emissary should visit him to discuss certain matters of mutual concern to himself'and the British Government. As you will see, the three questions in his opinion calling for discussion were ;— (1) Italy's new position in Arabia. (2) The position of the Shereefian rulers of 'Iraq and Trans-Jordan ; and (3) The position of Bolsheviks in Arabia and their conflict with Brifish economic interests. Of these questions the second, which really concerns the traditional hostility between King Ibn Sa'ud and the present rulers of 'Iraq and Trans-Jordan, will doubtless be raised by King Ibn Sa'ud in the course of your discussions regarding the situation on the Traq-Najd frontier. It is hoped that, with the information with which Mr. Cornwallis will be able to furnish you, supple mented by the facts which will be supplied to you by the Trans-Jordan * 59059/28 [No. 1]; not printed.i%) 89 -Government, you will be in a position to reassure His Majesty that, whatever may be the personal feelings towards himself of King Faisal and his brother the Amir Abdullah, such feelings are not allowed to affect in any degree the policy or actions of the Governments of those two countries, vis d vis his own territories. 15. With regard to the first of the questions mentioned above, I am to enclose for your information and guidance a copy* of a despatch addressed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to His Majesty's Ambassador in Rome. Unless King Ibn Sa'ud himself raises the question of the position of Italy in the south-west portion of Arabia you should not advert to the subject. If, however, the question is raised by His Majesty in the course of your discussions you should inform him that His Majesty's Government are giving their sympathetic attention to the views which he has expressed and are considering the best means of allaying his anxieties. 16. As regards the third question mentioned in King Ibn Sa ud s letter I leave it to your discretion, if a suitable opportunity presents itself, to point out to His Majesty the ill effects upon the pilgrimage and consequently upon the Hejaz Exchequer if the Bolshevik activities in the Hejaz are permitted to increase. You may assure His Majesty that if he will take the matter in hand His Majesty's Government will be glad to co-operate with him by giving him all the information that may reach them as to the presence of known Bolshevik agents or persons of pronounced Bolshevik views proceeding to the Hejaz under the guise of pilgrims. 17. As you are aware certain points raised by King Ibn Sa ud in the course of the conversations which you conducted with him in the summer of 19 7 in connection with the negotiation of the Treaty of Jeddah were left over for subsequent settlement, and it is desirable that you should know what action has been taken in regard to these matters by His Majesty s Government m the interval. In paragraph 22 of your despatch of the 6th of June, 1927,f you reported to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that King Ibn Sa'ud had raised the question of the restoration of the Hejaz Railway. \ou then in orme him that His Majesty's Government were discussing the matter with tne French Government ; ' His Majesty asked to be kept informed of the progress of the negotiations, and said that he presumed that he wou c e given e opportunity of nominating a representative to attend the con erence \\ ic would be held with a view to arranging a final settlement. In June last the French Government suggested that a conference of local experts should be held at Haifa, but that the activities of the conference should be limited to the discussion of technical questions. n i His Majesty's Government informed the French Government that they agreed to their suggestions, and expressed the hope that they w ou c His Majesty's Government in informing King 1 bn ^ Sa V Wnr.e at requesting him to nominate a representative to attenc e ,, tt r Haifa. Though their attention was on several occasions called ^ the mat , the French Government did not signify their accep anc ® , r P J Q n made by His Majesty's Government until the 23r o , f j to concert the 29th of December the British Consul at Jedda was Maiestv's with his French colleague in informing King Ibn Sa ud that M^e st y s Government and the French Government P™P 0 . sed should local experts from Palestine, Trans -Jordan, Syria he held at Haifa to consl ^ r ^ ,0 ^ r a ^f nt 0 have accepted this proposal, S'S th^^SthJSS^ been postponed nntil the hrst days of July. * 59059/28 [No. 6] ; not printed. t 49053/27 [No. 6]; not printed.18. As regards the question of capitulations, which was also under discussion in connection with the negotiations of the Treaty of Jeddah, the attitude of His Majesty's Government remains that they no longer claim capitulatory rights in King Ibn Sa'ud's territory, but do not intend to make any formal statement to that effect. A copy of a despatch addressed to His Majesty's Acting Consul at Jeddah* on this subject is enclosed. 19. A copy is also enclosed of a despatch to His Majesty's Acting Consul at Jeddahf on the subject of the Haramain Waqfs. You will see that His Majesty's Government cannot give any general promise of assistance to King Ibn Sa'ud in the matter of Haramain Waqfs, but that, subject to this reservation, they will, in this matter as in others, always be ready to consider sympathetically any request which he may make for assistance or advice. For the reasons given in the despatch addressed to Mr. Jekins, His Majesty's Government are unable to comply with the specific requests made by King Ibn Sa'ud to you. 20. In your despatch of the 9th of June to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs you reported that King Ibn Sa'ud entered into detail in regard to the particular case of the tribunals for the settlement of claims on account of raids, with special reference to Trans-Jordan, and that His Majesty had said that, as regards past raids, he would be willing to accept the award of an arbiter, provided that a selected British officer was appointed. His Majesty also suggested, to facilitate speedy settlement in the future, the appointment of a British officer, experienced in Arab habits and customs, whose duty it would be to keep a constant watch over tribal affairs and who would be the recipient of all details and information regarding raids as and when they took place. 21. In September last His Majesty was informed that His Majesty's Govern ment accepted his proposal for the appointment of a British officer to keep constant watch over tribal affairs on the Nejd-Trans-Jordan frontier, and that they proposed that this officer should act as arbitrator in disputes arising from past raids. His Majesty's Government proposed to entrust these duties to Mr. A. S. Kirkbride, the First Assistant to the British Resident in Trans-Jordan. King Ibn Sa'ud agreed to accept the findings of a British arbitrator, but he made it clear that he would not agree to the appointment of any person connected with the Governments of Palestine, Trans-Jordan or 'Iraq, either as an arbitrator on claims arising out of past raids or as the recipient of details and information regarding future raids. After further consideration His Majesty's Government decided in December last (1) to inform King Ibn Sa'ud that, if he agreed that one-half the cost of the appoint ment would be borne by the Government of Nejd, they would forthwith appoint as arbitrator on claims arising out of past raids an officer unconnected with the Governments of Palestine, Trans-Jordan or 'Iraq, and (2) to suggest to His Majesty that he should discuss with the officer so appointed the best means of providing machinery for the settlement of any future disputes. As His Majesty was then on the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf and as it seemed desirable that the matter should be discussed with him orally, it was decided to defer further negotiations until he returned to Jeddah. 22. His Majesty has now reopened the question. You should inform him that His Majesty's Government are prepared to appoint a British officer to arbitrate upon claims arising out of past raids between Trans-Jordan and Nejd, and that they undertake to select for this appointment an officer who has no connection with the administrations of Palestine, Trans-Jordan or 'Iraq. You should also inform His Majesty that in the view of His Majesty's Government this officer should adjudicate upon claims in respect of raids as far back as the date of the occupation of Jauf by King Ibn Sa'ud's Forces in * 49053/27 [No. 6]; not printed. f 49052,27 [No. 66] ; not printed.91 July, 1921, and that all claims, whether made by Trans-Jordan against Nejd or hy Nejd against Trans-Jordan, should be dealt with by him. If King Ibn Sa'ud agrees to these proposals, His Majesty's Government will appoint an officer to arbitrate upon the claims as soon as possible. 23. As regards the proposal that an officer should be appointed to deal with future disputes, there are practical difficulties in adopting this suggestion since that officer would owe allegiance to no local authority and could have no very clear or definite status. A further consideration is that it is most unlikely that the duties of receiving information about, and dealing with, tribal questions on the Nejd-Trans-Jordan frontier would occupy the full time and services of an officer. You should therefore explain to King Ibn ba ud the difficulties which lie in the way of the appointment of a whole-time officer for this purpose. 24. Failing the use of the tribunals provided for in the Hadda Agreement the alternatives appear to be (1) the appointment of a special arbitrator as and when need arises, or (2) the appointment by the Governments of irans- Tordan and Nejd of frontier officers from both sides, who would meet from time to time and deal on the spot with such difficulties as may arise on the frontier. If the latter alternative were adopted it might be desirable having regard to the possibility of a complete deadlock between the two frontier officers, to provide that, failing settlement by them any matter m dispute should be referred to a British officer unconnected with any of the local administrations. His Majesty's Government are content to leave it to you to decide (1) how far if at all King Ibn Sa'ud should be pressed to agree that future disputes and claims should be brought before the tribunals P rov jded for in the Hadda Agreement, and (2), failing agreement on this point, which of the alternative arrangements mentioned above should be adoptea. 25. I am to inform you that in accordance with your suggestion the Palestine Government have agreed to place at your disposal the . s ®^ ice d Mr. G.

Sl I am directed by Mr. Secretary Amery to Department of the 17th April,* numbere j vour p r0 p 0S ed Mission instructions of His Majesty's Governmen m S ^ Majesty to negotiate a settlement of outst anding questions w ithji — » Page 84.92 King Ibn Sa'ud. I am to explain that there are two further points, which may be raised in the course of your conversations with King Ibn Sa'ud, and which, as being of a subsidiary character, were not included in your official instructions. 2. The first of these points relates to a recent attack upon sections of the Beni Sakhr tribes within King Ibn Sa'ud's territory. In February last, the High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan reported that a large force of Wahabis led by Farhan Ibn Mashour attacked certain sections of the Beni Sakhr tribes while they were on grazing grounds in Najd territory, north-east of Jauf. The Sheikh of the Zeni section and his son, with about 100 other tribesmen, were killed, the survivors being carried off to Jauf. This report was forwarded to His Majesty King Ibn Sa'ud with a request that he would enquire into the circumstances and effectively punish the guilty parties. His Majesty has replied that the outrage was committed, not by Akhwan, but by a party of the Ruwala, who emigrated from Syria two years ago ; that his Amir at Jabal has arrested the criminals, who will be punished ; that certain of the Beni Sakhr who suffered have arrived at Jauf ; and that the Amir of Hail is enquiring into the matter and will recover the stolen property. You should inform His Majesty that His Majesty's Government much appreciate his assurances and hope that he will effect a settlement by which the Beni Sakhr tribesmen will be fully compensated for the damages and losses which they have suffered. 3. In regard to the second point, which relates to air matters in which King Ibn Sa'ud and His Majesty's Government are mutually interested, I am to transmit to you copies of two memoranda which have been prepared in the Air Ministry. These memoranda explain the position as it exists to-day and the wishes of His Majesty's Government for the future. It is the desire of His Majesty's Government that, if a satisfactory settlement is reached in regard to the main object of your mission, namely, the situation existing on the Najd-'Iraq frontier, and if a suitable opportunity presents itself and if you are satisfied that the general atmosphere is favourable, you should discuss with His Majesty both the question of a possible air route along the south west coast of the Persian Gulf and also the question of the supply of British pilots and mechanics to organise and operate His Majesty's own air service. You will observe that His Majesty's permission has already been sought for a reconnaissance party to visit the coast of Hasa in order to select suitable landing sites for possible use in connection with the projected air route to India. His Majesty has so far felt unable to grant the desired permission and it is hoped that, if the advantages of the establishment of an air service along the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf are explained to King Ibn Sa'ud, his concurrence in the visit of a preliminary reconnaissance party may be obtained. If, therefore, you are satisfied that there are good prospects of success, you should raise the matter with him and endeavour to obtain his concurrence as also his acceptance of the offer of His Majesty's Government in regard to the supply of British pilots and mechanics. The subject should not, however, be broached unless your negotiations in regard to the situation on the Najd-'Iraq frontier reach a successful conclusion. It is important that in the conduct of your mission no action should be taken which might give colour to the view that the interests of the 'Iraq Government have in any way been subordinated to those of His Majesty's Government.
