INDIA OF^ICi:, WHITEHALL, Dear Jones, 27th September, 1^46 I enclose herewith a copy of a Note by Sir Geoffrey Prior the Poiiticax Resident in the Persian Gulf (now on leave in this country) in which he suggests that it would be opportune to secure at 'an early date the agreement of'the Sheikh of Bahrein to the extension for another 10 years of the Bahrain Civil Air Agreement which is due to- expire at,the end of 1948. His suggestion has been put forward in connection with the question of the erection of oil tanks for the supply of aviation fufel at Bahrain.^ ^ou were concerned with the latter question at, an earlier stage but do not appear to have attended the latest meeting held by the Ministry of Fuel and Power on 14th September, of which I enclose a note. 2. Sir Geoffrey-Prior is due to return to the Gulf- via Bahrein in-about a month's time and if sanction Is ^ obtained here to the proposal, he could probably negotiate an extension of the agreement when he reaches Bahrein. .Ve should not wish to delay the arrangements which the Air Ministry are proDOsing to make with the A.I.O. jTor the supply of aviation fuel from Abadan, but it may be possible to arrange an extension of the agreement before our intentions in the matter of bulk storage tanks are revealed to B.A.P.C.O. and they connect the matter with our,rights under the Civil Air Agreement. 3. We shall be glad to know .your views on Sir Geoffrey Prior's suggestion thit he might offer some increased rate of payment to the Sheikh. We appreciate that there may be some difficulty in securing, at short notice, financial sanction for an increase of the present rates and it may be better to leave this aspect until renewal of the agreement has been broached to the Sheikh. We should, however, be glad if you could let us know the exact sun which H . j i. G. are at present paying to the Sheikh in connection with the Air Agreement. 4. As regards the last paragraph of Sir Geoffrey Prior's note, we have recently seen the report (forwarder! vith your lettjt R.7302/45/C.0.I. of 12th September) on a recent tour of the Middle ^ast and Africa by a Joint LiSvSion of the Ministry of Civil Aviation and B.O.A.C. in which there is sug;ested as a possibility the abandonment of Muharraq Aerodrome in favour of a new aerodrome near 'larnala on the main Bahrein Island.. The Civil Air Agreement, as Sir Geoffrey Prior points out, would cover such a new aerodrome ^ince it refers to 'aerodromes' in the plural. There has doubtless not yet been tine for you to consider the full implications of this suggestion but it would of course be helpful if we could know as soon as possible the future intentions of the Air Ministry and Ministry of Civil Aviation as regards Bahrein. 5. I should be grateful to have your comments at an early date. If you agree that this is desirable we will arrange a meeting of tnose concerned to discuss the ma f ter here in the near future.2. I an sending ^ copy of this letter to Hampton at the Air Ministry, who may perhaps wish to attend any meeting that may be arranged, to Cheetham at the Foreign Office, and also to Stock of the Ministry of Fuel and Power. Yours sincerely, CSd) F. A, K. HARiilSON NOTS BY S IR G EOFFR EY PR IOR Our position now rests entirely on the Civil Air Agreement which is due to expire in 1^48, and I feel that our n.rst act should be to renew it for another ten vears. We could explain to the Shaikh that heavy capital expenditure is contemplated, and that before incurring this we would naturally wish to secure our position for'some time ahead. It would only be reasonable to offer some increased rate of payment as the present figure is not very. hi;'h. Once the agreement has been extended we can then go ahead with the 'ancillary services' which will naturally include bulk storage. I think however it would be a mistake to siiow our intentions in'the matter of the bulk storage until we have secured the extension of the Civil Air Agreement. The Civil Air agreement as extended by trie Giiaikh is subseou^nt to the Shaikh's concession in which he gave B.A.P.C.O. the sole right to erect tankage and so -must be held to override it. The C.A.A. expressly mentions 'aerodrome or aerodromes' so that it would cover any new aerodromes we constructed. It would be helpful if the appropriate Ministry could make up their minds as early as possible just what they intend in the way of aerodromes In Bahrein, but in any* case we have nothing to lose and much to gain by extending the C.A.A. without delay.

It was, therefore, better to renew the Agreement straight away before B.A.P.C.O. became alive to the point. 2* lajor Jones said that it was impossible for the ItLnistry of Civil Aviation to say at the moment what their requirements for the use of Bahrein would be over the next ten years. B.O.A.C. Plying boat operations would be likely to end in about two years# Tho aerodrome at Muharraq was not ideal and was, in fact, unsuitable for very heavy aircraft. The suggestion for on alternative aerodrome at Hamaia had recently been -out forward, but this would involve an expenditure of about £2 million. kr. PiTiTpton said that the R.A.F's future uso of Bahrein was largely dependent on a decision not yet taken by the Chiefs of SV on post-war trooping, though continued heavy use was probable for at least three years. 4. In discussion there was general agreement that the need for the uoe of Bahrein as an air—port would remain for some time to come; it was explained that there might well be an increase in local short-range services using Bahrein. Moreover, any fees which were payable by foreign air lines for the use of it would acciue to H.M.G-. under the terms of the Civil Air --^reement, jid would to a se t off against the rental payable to the Sheikh. 3. In reply to an enquiry. Major Jones s id that che Sheikh received in 1944 from H.M.G. an initial payment of '3300, plus additional sums totalling £1,646. In 1943 the figures would probably be £500 plus a figure between £1,800 and £2,230. He undertook go provide Sir Geoffrey Prior with figures over the whole period since the inception of the Air Agreement in 1934. Sir Geof.f Prior said that he did not suggest: t'lat any increase in Dayments above the present rates should be offered to the Sheikh,' If he- asked for an increase, it might be worth while to concede it. 6./\ N *, ijftcr discussion, it vas o.firood thr.t, as a iiCcisuru 01 insurance;, the balance of advanta^ lay in negotiating for a renewal of tho expiry at tho end of 1948, Tho financial coui.dtment involved was small, and wo should sccuro tho control of aviation at B.ihroin for another ten y-'ars, apart from consolidating our position in regard to the erection of oil tanks# a.']or JonoL) unaortool-c t(3 bake . oops accordingly for obtaininp; the necessary financial sanction, uid co notify ohe India Office T/tien this had boon given# .- Id 3.R.850/C.0.1. i I Dear Hani son. iact.

Positiox^ of the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf in regard to Civil Aviation. , | Civil aviation agreements with the Sheikhs do not appear to conflict with Recommendation 1 of Section VIII of the Final act of the Chicago Conference, since the agreements are non-exclusive in so far as the use of airfields is concerned, H.U.G's exclusive rights being to establish and maintain, as agents for the Sheikhs, aerodromes in their territory. i ^ * The Sheikhdoms are however deemed tc^-be British territory for the purposes of the Agreement, under Section 2 of Article VIII of the Interim Agreement, and the obligations to accord traffic and non-traffic landing rights to co-signatorieslwill have to apply to them. This appears to override the provisions made in the Bahrain and Kuwait Civil Air Agreements not to grant the use of the aerodromes to foreign aircraft without the consent of the Sheikhs, and also the Air Navigation Regulations made by the Sheikhs, which provide that aircraft shall not fly over or land in their territory except under special authorisation. Although this is not of great practical importance at the moment, since no air ports have been designated in the Arab States, the position will have to be explained to the Sheikhs, sooner or later, in view of their potential commitments.

' ^ EIPT. BAHRA] t N«...C7. atel I have been shown -the India Office file regarding thi position of the Persian Gulf Shaikhdoms under the Chicago air agreement, end understand that I am invited to comment on this subject. J.p.bjM. ile regfi I would have preferred to defer comment until I had access to my own records, but my personal views, for what they are worth, are as follows. ' 2. By the final Act of the Conference it is apparently assumed under Recommendation 1 of Section Viii read with Article Viii Section 2 ofAppendix 1, that His Majesty's Government have acquired the right to dispose of the Shaikh doms interests in Civil Aviation. I submit that there is no foundation for this view. i 3. I will take the States in detail. First as regards the Trucial Shaikhs- the view is presumably based on the exclusive treaties of the 6th March, 1892. These treaties, however, do not code us any authority to grant concessions to foreigners without reference to the rulers, and the Shaikhs would certainly not interpret their agreements in this way. The rulers are, of course, well aware of their rights, and it will be recalled that we had the greatest difficulty in securing our own original air rights for ourselves! The Civil Air agreements with Sherjah and Debai give us no support as they are purely ad hoc arrangements for the benefit of B.O.A.C. Bchrain. iiere again our position is presumably based on th« exclusive Treaties of the 22nd December, 1880, and the 13th March, 1892. These treaties however are purely negative. The Shaikh binds himself not to enter into any agreement with foreign powers, but he doms not give us carte blanc^to act for him and in the past he has always been consulted in advance where his interests were affected. In addition the Civil Air Agreement expressly provides that we will not allow foreign aircraft to use Bahrain aerodromes without the Shaikh's consent, and this completely estops any claim on our part. 6. Kuwait. Here the exclusive treaty of 1899 is less emphatic th«n that of Bahrain and the Shaikh is not precluded from correspondence with foreign powers. His Air Agreement is equally definite and precludes us from allowing foreign aircraft to use the aerodrome or aerodromes without the Shaikh's consent. In other words the Shaikh expressly ret ins (and has been allowed by us to retain) the power to permit foreign aircraft to use his State 6. In the case of Muscat I understand th t it has been accepted that the Sultan is not bound by the Chicago Agreement and the question of bringing him into the picture is being pursued separately. 7. Where we give advance intimation of our requirements to Gulf States, make it clear to them that their Interests are being safeguarded, and take care not to offend their susceptibilities, then it is usually possible to obtain our requirements without difficulty. ' If this is not Jone the Political officer's task is rendered immesurably &gt; J 4 1V 2. more difflcultand a molehill may easily turn into a mountain. In this case I myself had not seen a copy of the agreement until a week or so ago* It must be remeinbered that our position in the Persian Gulf has no other foundation than the goodwill of the States and c n easily be undermined if this is once lost. 8. I think it is clear that our actions at Chicago cannot be held in any way binding on the Persian Gulf Shaikh- domsunless and until they have accepted the obligations involved. As I have temporarily vacated my post it does not seem appuopriate for me to suggest solutions for the difficulty and I would prefer to w?it until I have resumed charge and can consider the matter on the spot. I request that copies of this note be sent by Express Air Bag to the Government of India and the Political Resident, Persian Gulf.

I *FJCPRKSS LETTER . From - political Agent, Bahrain. Xo - political Resident, Bushire. No. C/1154. Dated the 30th of December, 1945. r. ^ V 1 Reference correspondence ending witu tiiis office telegram No. SlV ^dated the 19th of Xovember, 1945. 2 # On my recent visit to the Trucial Coast I interviewed the* Sheikh of Sharjah in connection with his refusal to accept his subsidy and allowances, and pointed out that he had renewed the Civil Air Agreement as recently as 1943 and that then was the time to suggest any alterations. He said that he would accept the money now and would write to me concerning his complaints. 3. He has now written saying that he would like increases from the 1st January in the follov'i*g!- (a) Pay of guards (b) Allowances and rent of the aerodrome / • ' 7 (c) Landing fee of civil aircraft f b !'* - (d) pouse rent. S V w 4. As regards (a) th^ Sheikh complained again in August, 1945, that the pay,dnd war allowance of the guards was insufficient../In reply he was told that it was considered that there did not appear to be any justi fication for an increase. Prom one aspect it is difficult to justify an increase since it does not appear to me that tne Sheikh keeps the stipulated number of 35 and 2 head guards. Also it is certain that the guards do not properly perform their functions and are often invol'/er in untoward incidents. There is, however, another aspect which is that while the presence of the guards was originally rendered necessary by the for^s being isolated in the desert and because of the possibility of bedouin raids, now it is on the edge of a large camp, is the centre of activity and the chance of bedouin raids has become negligible. The continued need for the presence of the guards is then only to maintain the Sheikh 1 s connection with the fort.for the safety of whose personnel he is still responsible and I should say also for guarding the water wells. 5. Although the war is over, reasons necessitating a war allowance still remain and it is a question as to whether the allowance should be enhanced or not. Guards now earn approximately Rs.5/-p.m. less than a daily labourer. This is wrong and I think that an increase to at least that rate is desirable, together with a propor tionate increase for the head guards. This rate could not be considered excessive. A further point is that unless the guards are properly paid it is difficult to hold the Sheikh responsible for tm their misbehaviour. /6. As regards6. As regards (b) the stteikh has seen a large modern R.A.F. cement-built camp grow up in the desert, when in 1942, Wakefield's D,0. No.C/216 dated the 23rd February, 1942, refers, he was asked and gave permission for 66 reed huts, a few minor buildings, etc., in con nection with a flight of Vincents together with a possible increase of R.A.F. for the war period. We cannot now, therefore, be surprised if the war being over and the original permission greatly exceeded the Sheikh requests an increase in his allowances. The Air Ministry and the B.O.A.C. do rent an area to serve as an aerodrome and whether the camp is on that area and whether the renting entitles them to build ac will on it (though from the asking of permission in 1942 I gather it does not) are matters that cannot be answered by me. From a political aspect the extended use we have made of Sharjah and apparently propose to continue to do, do justify, I think, an increase in the subsidy of Rs.500/ 7. As regards (c) I am unable to comment on the sufficiency or otherwise of the fee but in view of the increased traffic and the Sheikh's acceptance of the Agreement in 1943 I do not recommend an increase. 8. As regards (d) the Sheikh did. not mention the matter to me. The house is in an unfinished state and at the moment I see no reason for recommending an increase in rent. - ^ - i* - ^ -io r) r- 9. It is certain that Jrtie Sheikh will again mention the above complaints if iie is approached as contemplated in your letter No .l744 / of the 2nd December, 1945. 10.

His Majesty's Government also agree to amendments to Air Agreements proposed in your telegram No. 1776 (1746) subject to the following. In Article Two of Air Navigation Regulations words 'as may be specified w should not repeat not be deleted. As regards Articles Eight and Nine there is no need for amendment until Chicago Regulations are substituted for International Civil Air Nav igation Regulations but for the sake of clarity words 'as amended from time to time' should be added at end of Article Eight. 4.

I have replied that under Clause I of Agreement His Majesty's Government have exclusive right to establish and maintain Bahrain aerodromes and repair of any damage caused to aerodromes would be logical concequence. I presume this covers his point since he has now expressed his willingness to accept proposed amendments to Civil Air Agreement, and stated that he has no objection to foreign aircraft passing over Bahrain. 3. Shaikh has, however, raised question of revision of basis on which additional fees are paid, and has suggested that they should be levied according to the cargo or passenger carrying capacity of the aircraft. The point is not clear and I am taking it up with Belgrave and will report result as soon as possible. 4.

(Flying over or landing llof foreign aircraft in iShaikhdoms. il LEI.The 18th of April, 1946, Will you please refer fco your Demi-official letter No.652-29 dated the 26th March, 1946? r^; ^ In your letter No.458-29 of the 27th February, 1946, you stated that His Highness wished for a revision in the method of payment by foreign aircraft using Bahrain aero dromes in such a way that the fees payable on such services are calculated by tonnage ard not by services. In your letter No.652-29 you say that His Highness had in mind a revision of the basis upon which additional fees should be paid and wishes to suggest that the payments should not depend upon the number of extra services but should be levied according to the cargo or passenger carrying capacity of the aircraft. These two statements are contrary. ' S 3. From the Civil Air Agreement, all fees are collected, including landing and housing fees and other charges specified in Schedule II, by His Majesty's Government and the Shaikh is paid a certain specified amount in lieu. It seems to me that this is a very fair arrangement. In fact, it is even more favourable to Bahrain than it was during the time of the original making of the agreement for since that time His Majesty's Government have paid hundreds of thousands of pounds on ai'r communication facilities in Bahrain, and the Bahrain State receives full benefit from this and are in no way out of pocket. Although, as I have said before, I don't fully understand what it is that the Shaikh has in mind I do think that in view of the large expenditure His Majesty's Government have put into the aerodromes they would be unlikely to concede anything appreciable in favour of the Bahrain Government for addi tional services which, in any case, would not amount to much, I think, in cash value particularly if applied only to foreign aircraft. 4. ' I wish you would give this matter further thought, and again let me know whether His Highness really considers it worth while revising this very complicated macter after consideration of the foregoing. Yours sincerely, C. Dalrymple Belgrave, Esq., C.B.E., Advisor to the Bahrain Government, B A H R A IN .The Bahrain Government were from the first concerned at the exemption of customs d^ty on oil ani netrol for B.O.A. airoraft. vide - •. vo/y .T. fat$^ j ^•o Their concern increased with the increase ! .n 3.O.A.C. services and the realisation, fr^m a question of rebate of customs d'lty to the B.O .A.

From To N o .C/555. political Agent, Bahrain, political Resident at Bahrain Dated the 28th of May, 1946. I have recently observed that a civil air line styling itself ♦Morton's Airlines 1 is plying in the Persian Gulf using Dragon Rapide aircraft. Their •planes land at Bahrain and Sharjah and I should be grateful to receive information regarding this line and their operations. 2. As regards authority for flights and landings in Bahrainj The position would appear to be that under Article 3 of the Civil Air Agreement.the authority for landings, etc., is vested in the shaiich while for foreign aircraft authorisation lies with His Majesty^ Government under the amendment to the civil Air Agreement. 3. The Shaikh, however, authorises flights, etc., under the Air Navigation Regulations paragraph 1, but that paragraph has now been deleted. This, I presume, makes Article 3 of the Civil Air Agreement ineffective. 4. Thus it appears that His Majesty's Government authorizes flights, etc., of foreign aircraft, and as His Majesty's Government has not substituted its authority for that of the Shaikh in Article 3 there is no machinery to control civil British aircraft operating in Bahrain. I should be glad to know if this is the position, in which case Morton's and other British lines provided they conform with the Air Navigation Regulations are at liberty to use Bahrain at will. 6. It seems to me that an amendment to Article 3 of the Civil Air Agreement vesting authority in His Majesty's Government is required to enable His Majesty's Government to exercise control under the new paragraph 1 of the Air Navigation Regulations. 6. As regards landings, etc., at Sharjahi The position seems to be that the Air Agreement covers air craft of the British Overseas Airways Corporation and that there is no restriction on British aircraft except that in Article (v) of the agreement all civil aircraft 'shall pay the landing fee'. Whether this refers to B.O.A.C. craft only since it is embodied in an air agree ment covering their activities or refers to all British civil aircraft I cannot say, and should be grateful for a ruling.

Dear Ratcliffe-Cousins, I enclose a copy of an Express Letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf regarding flights by aircraft of 'Air Prance' over the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian G-ulf, 2. My attention has been drawn in this connection to the Agree ment of 28th February, 1946, with the French Government, Schedules l(B) and IIl(B) of which provide for landings in Bahrein, while Schedule IIl(A) provides for direct flights between Iraq and India, I have also seen a copy of the French Embassy's note of the 11th June stating that 'Air Prance' are putting into operation from 18th June the route provided for in Schedule l(B) and that the Company is making an exploratory flight commencing 11th June on the route Paris-Gairo-Basra-Delhi- Calcutta-Saigon. You will, however, observe from the Political Resident's letter that 'Air France' were already making regular landings on the Sharjah aerodrome before 30th May, 3. In the circumstances it may be considered desirable that enquiries should be made from the French Government about the landings reported in the Political Resident's Express Letter., It will also be necessary for the Political Resident to notify the Sheikh of Bahrein and the Trucial Sheikhs (including presumably Qatar) about the air services (including if possible information about the frequency) referred to in the Schedules to the Air Agreement with the French Government referred to above. Can we be assured that the Flights will not pass over Koweit territory? As regards flights across Muscat territory v/e agree with the Political Resident that it should be left to the French Government to make any approach to the Sultan direct, 4., I shall be glad to have your observations as soon as possible on the action to be taken. I am sending a copy of this letter and enclosure to Cheetham at the Foreign Office.

London, 28th Fehrvary, 1946. AGREEMENT RELATING TO AIR TRANSPORT BETWEEN BRITISH AND FRENCH TERRITORIES. The Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Provisional Government of the French Rep^kl ic, considering that the possibilities of civil aviation as a means of trai, 'ort have been considerably increased, that it is desirable to organise regular international air services in a reliable and orderly manner and to promote international co-operation in the greatest possible measure in this field, and considering that the previous Agreements concluded between the two countries regarding the operation of regular air services should be superseded by a more general Agreement adapted to suit the altered circumstances of air transport, have appointed their representatives who being duly authorised to this effect have agreed as follows; — Article I. Each contracting party grants to the other contracting party the rights specified in the Annex to this Agreement for the purpose of the establish ment of the air services therein described. These services may be inaugurated immediately or at a later date at the option of the contracting party to whom the rights are granted. Akticle II. (a) Each of the services specified in the Annex may be put into opera tion as soon as the contracting party to whom the rights specified in the Annex have been granted has designated an airline or airlines to operate the specified routes. (h) The airline or airlines thus designated by one of the contracting parties may be required to satisfy the competent aeronautical authorities of the other contracting party that thej are qualified, both technically and commercially, under the laws and regulations in force in that country, before being permitted to engage in the operations contemplated by this Agreement. Article III. (a) Each of the contracting parties agrees that the charges imposed on the designated airline or airlines of the other contracting party for the use of airports and other facilities shall not be higher than would be paid for the use of such airports and facilities by its national aircraft engaged in similar international services. (b) Fuel, lubricating oils and spare parts introduced into aircraft in the territory of one contracting party by, or on behalf of an airline designatedby the other contracting party and intended solely for use by the aircraft of the other contracting party shall be accorded, with respect to customs duties, inspection fees or other charges imposed by the former contracting party, treatment not less favourable than that granted to national airlines or the airline of the most favoured nation. (c) All aircraft operated by the airline or airlines designated by one contracting party on the routes covered by the present Agreement and supplies of fuel, lubricating oils, spare parts, normal equipment and aircraft stores retained on board aircraft of the designated airline or airlines of one contracting party shall be exempt, on entry into or departure from the territory of the other contracting party, from customs duties, inspection fees or similar duties or charges, even though such supplies be used by such aircraft on flights in that territory. Article IV. Certificates of airworthiness, certificates of competency and licences issued or rendered valid by one contracting party shall be recognised as valid by the other contracting party for the purpose of operating the services spe^ied in the Annex. Each contracting party reserves the right, however, to -vtjfuse to recognise, for the purpose of flight above its own territory, certificates of competency and licences granted to its own nationals by another State. Article V. (a) The laws and regulations of one contracting party relating to entrv into or departure from its own territory of aircraft engaged in international air navigation or to the operation and navigation of such aircraft while within its territory, shall apply to aircraft of the designated airline or airlines of the other contracting party. (b) Passengers, crews and consignors of freight shall be required in the territory of either contracting party to comply, either in person or through the intermediary of a third person acting in their name and on their account, with the laws and regulations governing the entry into, the presence in and the departure from that country of passengers, crews or freight, such as the regulations relating to entry, clearance, immigration, passports, customs and quarantine. Article VI. ^ich contracting party reserves the right to withhold a certificate or permit to operate from an airline of another State, or to revoke it, in any case where it is not satisfied that substantial ownership and effective control are vested in nationals of the other party to this Agreement, or in case of failure by an airline to comply with the laws and regulations referred to in Article V, or to fulfil its obligations under this Agreement. Article VII. The two contracting parties agree to appoint a Standing Joint Com mittee to co-ordinate their respective air services and, where necessary, to submit lor the approval of the competent aeronautical authorities of the two countries proposals for the modification of the Annex of this Agreement. This Committee shall be composed of two representatives of the competent aeronautical authorities of each of the contracting parties and ot t\\ () representatives of the airlines of each of the two countries. The Committee shall meet alternately in London and Paris under the chair- manship ot one of the representatives of the competent aeronautical authorities of the contracting party in whose territory the meeting is held.4 Article VIII. (a) The contracting parties agree to submit to arbitration any dispute relating to the interpretation or application of this Agreement or of the Annex thereto which cannot be settled by direct negotiation. (b) Any such dispute shall be referred to the Council of the Inter national Civil Aviation Organisation set up by the Convention on Inter national Civil Aviation signed at Chicago on the 7th December, 1944,or, pending the entry into force of the said Convention as between the two contracting parties, to the Interim Council set up by the Interim Agree ment on International Civil Aviation signed at Chicago on the same date.( 2 ) (c) Nevertheless, the contracting parties may, by mutual agreement, settle the dispute by referring it either to an Arbitral Tribunal or to any person or body that they may designate. (d) The contracting parties undertake to comply with the decision given. Article IX. If both contracting parties ratify a general multilateral Air Convention, or adhere to it, the present Agreement or its Annex shall be amend^l so as to conform with the provisions of the said Convention from the di of its entry into force as between them. Article X. The present Agreement shall supersede all previous Anglo-French Agreements on air transport, notably those of the 7th August, 1929, and the 12th August, 1937. Article XI. This Agreement and all contracts connected therewith shall be registered with the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organisation set up by the Interim Agreement on International Civil Aviation signed at Chicago on the 7th December, 1944. Article XII. This Agreement shall enter into force on the date of signature. If either of the contracting parties considers it desirable to modify any provision or provisions of the Annex to this Agreement, such modification may be made by direct agreement between the competent aeronayi^cal authorities of both contracting parties. Either contracting party may at any time give notice to the other contracting party that it desires to terminate this Agreement. Such notice shall take effect twelve months after the date of the receipt of the notice v by the other contracting party, unless the notice to terminate is withdrawn by agreement before the expiry of this period.

The two Delegations have noted their agreement in principle on the great advantage which such reciprocal renunciation would have from the point of view of the users and from that of the economic operation of the services^ (2) It has become clear that, stated in general terms, the application of principles of the division of capacity and of the conclusion of agreements between companies on the common stages of the routes operated in Europe by the airlines of the two countries would be difficult, but thij^ this procedure is to be recommended in application of the principles sta^d in paragraph 5 of the Annex within the framework of European routes. (3) It has been agreed that paragraph 5 (d) (2) of the Annex authorised the airlines of each of the two countries to operate their trunk routes on the basis of a minimum frequency to be determined by the Standing Joint Committee set up by Article VII of the Agreement, and that, in particular, on the French trunk route to Indo-China, this frequency shall be six services a week.

Dear Cheetham, B.O.A.G. have informed us that when the 'G' Class flying boats are yathdravm at the end of this year they will no longer need the staging posts at Sharjah/Dubai which are at present used for land p anus and 1lying boats respectively. They enquire whether the S.A.F. have a continuing interest in Sharjah and if so whether thoy would be prepared to maintain signals and other facilities there. So far as B.C..i.e. themselves are concerned they would only want to keep one moonng for emergency use. , . Pr j rna facie if B.O.A.C. no longer need to call at Sharjah and iJuoaL there is no reason why they should continue to provide facilities there unless in view of the present political situation in Persia it is considered desirable that we should retain any footholds wo already have on the Persian Gulf. ^ The present arrangements at Sharjah and Dubai are covered bv agrecmentswith the Sheikhs. The original agreements terminated in 1943 when they were renewed for a further period of five years. They !u tW0 Tnore .^ ars t0 ^ before expiring. The agreements provide- .or the provision and operation by Imperial Airways (now B.O.A.O.' tx aerodrome facilities for their own purposes at specified financial terms and for landings by R.A.P. aircraft free of cost. • thG havo in fact a continuing interest + wh ^ ch the y contemplate retaining as a staging post on the regular 1 flight 8 t0 ^ that th;i ' S Wil1 n0t naccssaril y involve Apart from the political considerations India is also interested because she will sooner or later be operating airlines to the Persian Gulf rem Karachi to Basrah and may need the use of these stations. We are sending a copy of this letter to Prance at the India Office and perhaps i enough to let us havo the views of the Government of India on this aspect.

Dear Jones, , Would you please refer to your letter to Cheetham No«R»13848/46 of 25th June about air facilities at Sharjah and Dubai, 2, Prom the political angle wo should wish to consult the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Government of India before giving a definite answer on the points raised, and for this purpose a firmer indication of the Air Ministry's views would be desirable. Our provisional views, however, are as follows (a) Under our agreements with the Sheikhs the only State or Government which is entitled to conclude. 1|i Air Agreement with either Sharjah or Dubai is I&amp;e Majesty^ Government* (b) As regards Dubai, if neither B.O.A.C. nor the R.A.P. nor the Government of India have any further requirements for facilities there, it would seero that the Air Agreement should be terminated. / n (.o; As regards Sharjah it would perhaps be preferable in order to avoid the accusation that we were establishing an R.A.P» base there, for the facilities required by the R.A»P« to be covered by a Civil Air Agreement in the present form even if the continuing civil air requirements were only a small proportion of those of the R.A.P. and the aerodrome were manned by the R.A.P. In that case, however, the Agreement would probably require some modifications e.g. the references to B.O.A.C. might be replaced by references to 'H.M.G. or their agents'. 3* As regards the future requirements of Indian civil air lines at Sharjah and Dubai, we are asking the Government of India whether they can give us any information about this. 4* I am sending copies of this letter to Y/arren and Cheetham.

This would tide over a period of fluctuations in the Air transport situation, and, were a fresh agreement required early for some unforeseen reason, might avoid a probable demand for an enhanced rate. (y) as regards para 2(c) ibid, I agree generally with the views expressed and in addition think that we cannot do without Sharjah airfield now because of oil developments. Further, the Fort at Sharjah has come to be looked upon as a stronghold of British authority on the Trucial Coast and I would be very sorry to see it closed down. I am strongly opposed to its being transferred to the Shaikh whose property it does not become until some 20 years hence reckoning at the present rate of payment. Sd/- A.C. GALLOWAY.

Possibly the explanation is that the military service which the French tvere operating on this route prior to the Bilateral Agreement, and which was operated under transport Cor.T iand control, was directed -bo use Shar jah, and the conplete conversion of this para-irdlitary service to a pure civilian service is oniy ^raflually being effected. In order to clear up these points we propose to bring them up at the next meeting of the Joint Standing Coonittee for which provision is made in Article VII of the Agreement, and to take the following actions- (a) To ask the French:- ♦ ^ (i) Why they are usinr, Shar jah, (il) Whether they will cross Kowelt territory, /(b) P # A.K. Harrison Esq., India Office, Kin: Charles Street, London* S.W#1#% /&lt;o7 ('b) To point out to them that Muscat is an independent sovereign State and that if they are proposing to cross Muscat territory they roust make a direct approach to the Sultan* In the meantime vaould there be any harm in informing the Sheiks of Koweit, Bahrein and the Trucial Coast that the French have been authorised by His Majesty's Government to operate this service, and that in the course of such operations French aircraft may fly over their territories. The argument in para# 2 of the Political osident's letter Ko« C/176 of the 30th May appears to be inverted* Article b of the Chicago Convention (irhich by the way is not yet in lorcej, is the general provision and lays down that no scl'ocluled international air service may be operated over or into the territory of a Contracting State except with the special penrdssion or o ther authorisation of that 6tate* Vh# Other authorisation 11 is in this oase provided j!. the Air Transit Agreemsnt, Artiolo I of \/hich craft of all Contracting States the privilege to our territories without landing and to land for non-tra.fio puxposes* I am sending a copy of this letter to Cheatham at the Foreign Office*. i 7?./5fc No. C/537 Office of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp Bahrain.

The reference presumably is to 'liorton iiir Services Ltd' v/hich is a firn engaged in air taxi and charter flights. It has carried out a nunber of charter flights between the United Kingdom and India since January 1946, but there is no question of a regular air service. The operations of the Cooparx/ are not illegal as the lav/ stands, nor are they prohibited by the Civil .Aviation Bill nor/ before Parliament, It is possible that we may have to give consideration in this Ilinistry to the devising of measures for the better control of non-regular operations for hire, but for the present v/e should be inclined to endorse the suggestion of the Political Resident that in as much as these operations are covered by the licence granted to the aircraft, no special authorisation in the terms of the Civil iir Agreements with the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit is necessary. We should agree also that the words^by the Sheikh' should be expunged from Article 3 of both the Civil Air Agreements. The aircraft of the Company normally follow the route liarseilles-Elmas-Tunis-Tripoli-Benghazi-El Adem-IIersa Ilatruh- A Ima za -Ly dda-Habb aniy a - Sha ib ah-B ahr c in-Shar jah-J iwani- Karachi-Bombny.

Neither is the aerodrome suitable for the modern aircraft which the Corporation expects to operate in the future. With regard to Sharjah and Dubai, the use of Dubai as an alighting place for flying boats will cease at the end of this year when the 'C' Class flying boats are withdrawn, and the alighting area will then only be used in an emergency by the Hythes or Solents, Although I know of no plans to use the land aerodrome at Sharjah at the present time, I am unable to confirm definitely whether the Station will be closed down as far as the Corporation is concerned as the matter is under discussion between the Corporation and the Ministry of Civil Aviation.

With regard to the question of the rent of the rest house and attached buildings, if present economic conditions justify any increase in the rent stipulated fot the rest house it is arguable that it should be accorded even if it only means that the Shaikhs deb^t will be liquidated a few months earlier than would otherwise be the case.

With reference to para,2 of India Office demi-official letter to the Ministry of Civil Aviation of 6th Juty, Air Ministry's vie\7s have now been received. They state that the airfield at Sharjah is a permanent requirement as a staging post on the Royal Air Force trunk route to the Par East, and that the Air Ministry would accordingly be prepared, under suitable conditions, to take over responsibility for this airfield from B.O.A.C. and to provide such emergency facilities as B.O,A«C. may require. There will be no regular R.A.P, requirement for the use of Dubai, and the Air Ministry think it would be all right to discontinue the lease of this base.

Repeated to Cairo No. 8 CIVATT SAVING Washington No. 5 SAVING ■a My United States colleague informs me that in course of a visit to Riyadh on July 4th, General Giles, now Vice-President of T. v.. A. , concluded operational agreement with Saudi' Arabian Government covering flights by Company over Saudi territory and use of Dhahran airfield on its service Cairo to Bombay. 2. Routes specified are Cairo-Lydda-Basra-Dhahran and Cairo-Dhahran direct by northern route reported in my telegram No. 359 of 9th August 1945. Special prior permission must be obtained for flights by any other route. # 3. Agreement is valid for two years from July 4th 1946, automatically rene\ able for further tv/o years unless denounced by 60 days notice before end of first period. 4. Record of landing is to be kept for purposes of estimation of landing dues, but dues are not specified in agreement. They are to be 'in accordance with international practice'. Company is to benefit by any more favourable terms given later to any other Company. 5. Saudi Government tried to write into agreement a provision that first four (half eight) passages available from Dhahran to either Bombay or Cairo should be preferentially reserved for Saudi nationals, and that Company should accept unlimited responsibility to carry Saudi mails. General Giles declared that these stipulations would conflict with C.A.I3. practice, but he wrote Saudi Arabian Government a letter undertaking to be as helpful in these matters as circumstances allowed 6. Present intention seems to be t'o operate a service once a fortnight each way.

The main correspondents in the file are the Political Agent in Bahrain (Major Arnold Crawshaw Galloway until July 1946, thereafter Hugh Rance), and the Political Resident of the Persian Gulf (Sir Geoffrey Prior until November 1945, Sir Rupert Hay thereafter).The file begins with correspondence related to negotiations for the continuance of the Civil Air Agreement already in place between the British Government/British Overseas Air Corporation (BOAC) and the Government of Bahrain (see 'File 13/1 I Aerodrome at Bahrain' IOR/R/15/2/505 for the original agreement). Notes from a meeting that took place at the India Office in London on 9 October 1945, outline the British Government's reasons for wishing to extend the Agreement by seven years (folio 9).Subsequent correspondence in the file relates to a number of new air routes proposed between Europe and India/Asia, which would entail increasing numbers of international aircraft passing over or refuelling on the Arab Gulf coast. These airlines included Transcontinental and Western Airlines (TWA), Air France, Morton Air Services Limited, and Dalmia Jain Airways. The Chicago Convention, an international code intended to coordinate and regulate international air travel, had been signed on 7 December 1944. Amongst its provisions was the need to accord equal rights to all aircraft flying over foreign territories. In response to the convention, the British Government had to seek the Arab coast sheikhs' agreement to conform to the Chicago code, in order to permit airlines such as TWA and Air France the right to fly over or land in the dominions. Copies of the letters sent by Galloway to the various sheikhs are included in the file (folios 41-48), along with the sheikhs' replies (folios 61-66, 70-71, 73-80). The file also includes a printed copy of an agreement between the British and French Governments relating to air transport between British and French territories, issued on 28 February 1946 (folios 129-140), and reports of TWA's plans to fly to Bombay via Saudi Arabia (folio 184).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Overseas Airways Corporation</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Bahrain, Āl Khalīfa dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Trans World Airlines</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Qatar</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Trucial Coast</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Civil aviation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0002ea#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
