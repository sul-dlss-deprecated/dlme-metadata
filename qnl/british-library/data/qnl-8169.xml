Merewether also raises the question of whether Gwadur could be purchased or leased by Britain should Torkee now succeed and be recognised as Sultan.The letter concludes by discussing the Kandahar affair, which he hopes will be resolved sooner than expected.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023517966.0x000017#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
