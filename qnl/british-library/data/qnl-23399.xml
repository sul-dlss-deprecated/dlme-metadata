All hres are small at first. The only way to the^Start. ^ overcome the fire danger is to be prepared to stop the outbreak at the start—before any dap-^ge is done. It is the duty of every responsible pei^ii to instal suitable first-aid Fire Extinguishers which can be used by anyone on the spot at the time of the outbreak. How to Kill Fire The No. 3 “ CONQUEST ” Fire Extin- o ^ Co nc iV e . st uishe,- affords a simple, efficient, and No. 3 Lxtinguisher # economical means or providing such pro- tection. It is exceptionally easy to operate, and is effective upon all ordinary outbreaks of fire. By striking the plunger at the top of the Extinguisher, a powerful jet of fire killing fluid is immediately projected. It is a simple matter to direct this jet at the seat of the flames, which it will quickly quench. Soda-Acid Type The No. 3 Two Gallons “CONQUEST” C-apacity. Fire Extinguisher is a two gallon machine of the sealed bottle soda and acid type. By striking the plunger the acid bottle seen in the sectional illustration is broken, and the acid is released into the body of the Extinguisher which contains a solution of bi-carbonate of soda. By this means carbon- di oxide gas is generated in sufficient pressure to eject the fluid through the syphon tube to the nozzle. ^ H ^ ( The Extinguisher is ‘ Creep made of 18 S.W.G. lead-coated steel and is tested to 330 lbs. pressure to the sq. inch much more than the normal pressure developed. The latest improved modal embodies a “non-creeping” device which eliminates gradual overflowing of the solution down the side of the Extinguisher. It is also fitted with a valve which automatically seals the plunger when compressed. Thus, it is impossible for the acid to leak through the plunger when in operation. There are no CONQUEST No. 3 Fire Extinguisher. Sectional ViewAttractive and reliable moving parts to corrode or get out of order. The improved acid bottle cage is designed to hold even the smallest particles of broken glass when the bottle is broken A new type of nozzle is fitted to this machine and the handle is set at a convenient angle which allows the nozzle to be directed toward the flames when the Extinguisher is held by one hand. The “ CONQUEST ” No. 3 Extinguisher is japanned red with an attractive label in blue and gold, and is fitted with a polished brass top cap and nozzle. Being made in our own Works the No. 3 “ CONQUEST ” Extinguisher, although eco nomically priced, can be absolutely relied upon.

How to meet them. Principle of Thomene Trotection. N OW that oil is used so extensively for fuel and other purposes, special pro tection against lire both on board ship and ashore has become increasingly necessary. No amount of con structional precaution can eliminate the fire risk where large quantities of oil are stored or used and obviously water is quite useless against blazing oil. It was to meet these hazardous fire risks that the “ Phomene ” Foam method of Fire Protection was introduced. In one or other of its several forms of application Phomene Fire Protection has been installed verv extensively by Oil, Petrol, and Shipping Companies amongst others using or storing quantities of oils and spirits. Phomene Fire Appliances extinguish these hazardous fires by the application of a smothering blanket of foam. The tough skin of the minute foam bubbles is charged with C0 2 gas and the foam spreads over the surface of the blazing liquid excluding the oxygen and blotting out the flames. Phomene Foam withstands great heat and prevents re-ignition of surfaces already covered. It is therefore, more per manently effective than the application of a free gas. The Phomene Charge comprises two powders only. These are readily soluble in water and the foam is generated immediately the two solutions are brought together. The quantity of foam produced is many times the volume of the solutions used.r How to fight Fires ‘Board of Trade •Approval. Extinguishing Oil Fires by the application of foam is a fully established principle and is approved by the Board of Trade and the Fire Offices Committee. Phomene Installations. Our Engineering Department specialises in the designing of Foam Installations for the protection of ships and also for oil fields and premises where oils or spirits are stored in bulk. Gravity Air, or Steam Operation. Phomene Installations are designed to meet every possible condition. They may be actuated by gravity or by the application of air pressure, or by the use of steam, electric motor, or petrol engine pumps. The distribution of the solutions is controlled by valves. If desirable, controls can be placed in positions remote from the area protected. Efficiency with Economy. In the following pages particulars of Phomene Installations are given. Attention is invited to the special features we have introduced which not only add to the efficiency of the installation, but at the same time effect yery considerable reductions in the cost of erection and eliminate a large amount of complicated piping.

It is sufficiently com prehensive to make it unnecessary to describe the installations in detail. There are several important features that are worthy of particular note in view of their bearing on the efficiency of the system and economy in labour and reduction of erection costs. They may be summarised briefly as follows: Economy in Tanks The strengths of the two PHOMENE solutions have been relatively proportioned to give the greatest amount of foam in the smallest possible tank space, thereby minimising both cost of tanks and total weight. Reduced The distributing system (for Costs which a patent has been applied) is specially designed to reduce very considerably the amount of piping and to simplify, and con sequently reduce the cost of erection. There is practically no piping necessary under the floor plates, as the use of PHOMENE spreaders and the prin ciple upon which our PHOMENE distributing system is designed, enables us to use the free spaces around the boilers for the running of the pipe lines. Practical A special feature of the design Advantage. ^ ^ p HOM £ N £ ticn is not affected by the list and trim of the ship. Another advantage of the PHOMENE distributing system is that it avoids the possibility of air-locks due to the rise and fall in the set of the pipes necessary to clear obstructions under the floor. Efficiency PHOMENE adjustable 01 bpreaders , J spreaders are screwed to the ends of the pipes just under the floors. Each spreader is designed to distribute a large volume of foam over a con siderable area. They are placed in posi tions so that the whole of the area will be quickly and efficiently covered with foam. They have an outlet of ample proportions so that there is no liability to obstruc tion by the collection of dust or scale from the pipes. Phomene Foam Spreader Efficient Drainage The whole arrangement of the pipe lines lends itself to efficient drainage. Valve Control I he valves are geared together in pairs as a self-contained unit and so arranged as to ensure both valves being opened or securely closed by one operation. The valves can be operated either locally, remotely, or from both positions. PHOMENE Installations Alternative Operating r j • , - Methods embodying these features which keep down erection costs and at the same time greatly increase fire-fighting efficiency, can be designed for operation either by gravity, pumps, or compressed air, to suit individual requirements.

(Patent No. 294,392) T HE above illustrations show the standard 2-gallon “PHOMENE” Extinguisher and also the special model which has a double sealing valve. This Extinguisher is approved by the Fire Offices Committee, for Insurance Rebate purposes. It is the ideal form of first aid fire protection for premises in which highly inflammable liquids are stored or used in bulk. It is very easily operated and is strongly recommended for enabling anyone on the spot to stop at the start an outbreak involving oils, spirits, varnish, etc. The provision of this hand extinguisher often obviates the necessity for bringing into action one of the larger Engines and puts out the fire before any appreciable damage is done. This Extinguisher is brought into action immediately upon being turned upside down. The lead stopper shown in the sectional view clears the ports of the inner con tainer and permits its contents to mix with the solution in the outer container. The foam is projected through the nozzle to a distance of about 25 feet. To meet the special conditions associated with carrying Phomene Extinguishers on Motor Fire Engines, etc., we have designed the double sealing valve illustrated above. This definitely seals the inner container so that the two solutions cannot mix prematurely due to severe shaking or being knocked over accidentally. To release the valve it is only necessary to give the handle a half turn to the right or left. The Extinguisher should then be turned upside down to bring it into action.

The 34 gallon Pyrene fire engine appears ‘n generally suitable for use here. You have,however, unfortunately omittea the most important item of all, namely the price. I would be glaa if you would let me know as early as possible the price F.O.B Bahrain at which you can supply these articles to the Bahrain Municipality. The 'Phomene” type fire engine aid not appear entirely suitable since the fires occurring in Bahrain are almost invariably those of wood huts maue of palm branches. Vihat would be the cost of a refill for a 34 gallon Pyrene fire engine and is it possible for a portion of the chemical to be used,the remainder being kept for use on another occasion or must the whole quantity,v.hen once generates,be employee on the same occasion.
