Kemball also discusses negotiations to force the Al Ali tribe to withdraw from the conflict and return to Kenn [K&#299;sh] on the Persian Coast, and the necessity of forcing Shaeikh Mu&#7717;ammad bin &#8216;Abdull&#257;h to relinquish his claims on Bahrain, as being a prerequisite for the restoration of order in the region. Kemball also writes that his claim of negligence of duty against the British Agent at Bahrain, Hajee Jassim [Hajj&#299; J&#257;sim], have been found to be groundless.The following enclosures are included with Kemball&#8217;s letter:1. Letter no.123 of 1854 (folio 71), a covering letter from Commodore George Robinson, Commanding Officer Persian Gulf Squadron, to Kemball, dated 4 August 1854, enclosing with it a letter (folios 72-73) from Lieutenant Alex Foulerton, Commanding Officer of the Honourable Company&#8217;s brigantine
                           Tigris, to Robinson, dated 1 August 1854. In his letter Foulerton informs Robinson that the brother of the ruler of Bahrain, Shaikh Alli bin Kallifa [ &#8216;Al&#299; bin Khal&#299;fah] has blocked Damm&#257;m with over 400 boats and 5,000 men. Foulerton appends a note to his letter, sent by him to Mu&#7717;ammad bin Khal&#299;fah and dated 30 July 1854, in which he informs Shaikh Mu&#7717;ammad that he is to assist him &#8220;should any force come to Bahrain to attack you&#8221;.2. Letter no.1B (folio 73) from Kemball to Robinson, dated 3 August 1854, informing Robinson of his intention to force the withdrawal of the Al Ali tribe from the Arab coast. Kemball requests that Robinson organise transit for Sultan bin Ali of the Al Ali tribe to visit Kemball in Bahrain;3. Letter no.123 of 1854 (folio 74) a covering letter from Robinson to Kemball, dated 8 August 1854, forwarding a letter (folios 76-77) from Foulerton to Robinson, dated 7 August 1854. Foulerton reports of his cruise to Damm&#257;m to issue letters to Shaikh Mu&#7717;ammad bin &#8216;Abdull&#257;h. Foulerton writes that the Bahrain Agent reports that Amir Fysul [Fay&#7779;al ibn Turki], the Wahh&#257;b&#299; ruler, is sending a further 4,000 men to assist Shaikh Mu&#7717;ammad bin &#8216;Abdull&#257;h, and that Humeed bin Mujdell has 500 men, which suggests a renewed attack on Bahrain is imminent;4. Letter no.2B of 1854 (folios 78-79) from Kemball to Robinson, dated 8 August 1854, requesting that Robinson be prepared to defend Bahrain, and by force if necessary. Kemball also writes that he has informed Shaikh Ali bin Sultan of the Al Ali tribe, that he has twenty-four hours to leave their present anchorage at Damm&#257;m;5. Letter no.3B of 1854 (folio 80) from Kemball to Robinson, dated 19 August 1854. Kemball informs Robinson that, in light of Shaikh Mu&#7717;ammad&#8217;s agreement to desist from further attacks on Bahrain, and the Al Ali tribe having withdrawn from the area, it is not necessary for the
                           Tigristo stay at Damm&#257;m, though frequent patrols would continue to be necessary;6. Letter no.131 of 1851 (folio 81) from Robinson to Kemball, dated 21 August 1854, acknowledging receipt of Kemball&#8217;s previous letter, and stating that he will instruct Lieutenant Foulerton on the
                           Tigristo remain in the area, going to Bushire for supplies when necessary.The remaining enclosures constitute Kemball&#8217;s negotiations with Shaikh Mu&#7717;ammad bin &#8216;Abdull&#257;h, towards the latter withdrawing his present claim on Bahrain. The negotiations make reference to previous agreements made between Kemball&#8217;s predecessor, Lieutenant-Colonel Samuel Hennell, and Shaikh Mu&#7717;ammad bin &#8216;Abdull&#257;h&#8217;s father, Shaikh Abdull&#257;h bin A&#7717;med:7. Enclosure no.7 to letter 1A, a translation of an engagement (folio 82) of Ali bin Sultan, chief of the Al Ali tribe, to abstain from interference in the affairs of Bahrain while located on the Persian coast, dated 15 August 1854;8. Enclosure no.8 to letter 1A, the translation of a letter (folios 82v-85) from Shaikh Mu&#7717;ammad bin &#8216;Abdull&#257;h to Kemball, dated 7 August 1854;9. Enclosure no.9 to letter 1A, the translation of a letter (folios 85-86) from Kemball to Shaikh Mu&#7717;ammad bin &#8216;Abdull&#257;h, dated 8 August 1854;10. Enclosure no.10 to letter 1A, the translation of a letter (folio 87) from Shaikh Mu&#7717;ammad bin &#8216;Abdull&#257;h to Kemball, dated 11 August 1854;11. Enclosure no.11 to letter 1A, the translation of a letter (folio 88) from Kemball to Shaikh Mu&#7717;ammad bin &#8216;Abdull&#257;h, dated 19 August 1854;12. Translation of a letter (folio 89) from Shaikh Mu&#7717;ammad bin &#8216;Abdull&#257;h to Kemball, dated 22 August. Included with the letter is a translation of a letter (folios 90-91) from Colonel Hennell [former] Resident in the Persian Gulf, to Shaikh Abdull&#257;h bin A&#7717;med, dated 11 August 1846;13. Translation of a letter (folio 92) from Kemball to Shaikh Mu&#7717;ammad bin &#8216;Abdull&#257;h, dated 23 August 1854.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051557.0x00000d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods>	</en_metadata>
