                           Ternateat Bassidore [Bāsaʻīdū], dated 1 August 1824.The enclosure is reporting that the 'pirate boat' captured at Charrack bay was not in a fit state to be returned to Sharga. As a result, it mentions that an individual from that port was sent over to identify it. Now this has been done, the letter conveys the Captain's recommendation (accepted by the Resident) that the boat should be broken up.It also notes that the HC Cruizer
                           Nautilushas been ordered back to Bombay for a refit, due to its poor condition.2 - Letter from Sooltan bin Sugger to Ephraim Stannus, no date.The enclosure conveys Sooltan bin Sugger's claim that he knew nothing of the 'pirate boat's' activities, and that the individuals responsible have fled his territory. It further includes an admission from him that while he has been negotiating with the Wahabi [Wahhabi], his motivation is limited to securing a non-aggression agreement and self-preservation.Reported in the enclosure are the deaths of two of Sooltan bin Sugger's people, Hamed bin Hamed and Said bin Mushari, which he would like the Resident to investigate, along with the case of the 'Congoon [Kangān] bugla'; Sooltan bin Sugger claims that the people of Congoon have taken one of his buglas and that he is prevented by the English from retaliating.3 - Extract from a letter from Ephraim Stannus to Sooltan bin Sugger, dated 8 June 1824.The enclosure is reporting on the outcome of the Resident's investigation into the Congoon bugla; the Resident has concluded that it originally belonged to the people of Congoon, and was taken by the Joassmees [Qawāsim] while on a trading voyage. It explains that the Resident requires proof that this is not true in order to intervene further, and recommends that Sooltan bin Sugger drops the matter entirely.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054665.0x000016#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
