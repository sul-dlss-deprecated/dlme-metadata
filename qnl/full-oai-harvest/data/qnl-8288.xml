The papers cover the initial discussion of the need for special officers to maintain order amongst foreign subjects in Bahrain which was triggered by a violent incident involving Bahrain Petroleum Company employees, details of which are reported by the Political Agent, Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon Loch, in April 1936 (folios 33-34). Interdepartmental consensus over the text of the regulation and the appropriate powers to be given to the special officers is then sought between the India Office, Foreign Office, and Government of India (Foreign and Political Department).A copy of the new regulation is on folio 8.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Bahrain Order in Council (1913)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x00036a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
