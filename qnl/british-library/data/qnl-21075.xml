To The Hon T l)le the lolitio&amp;l iiesident in the_ Persian Qnlf f Bushiroi Sir, I hpve the honour to say that matters have apparently come to a head between Bin Baud and. the powerful .usaibi family. In a conversation before a third nerson Abdiula &gt;;Usaibi,who is notoriously hot headed,stated that all the brothers had combined and signed a letter to bin Baud saying that they would not supply him with any goods on credit unless he made some arrangement for settling their outstanding debts which amount to some 17 lacs of rupees. Abdulla Qusaibi expressed himself with unusual heat,and stated that they had even given an ultimatum to their loyal master to the effect that if their demands were not met they would remove their families from Nejd to Bahrain and apply to be registered as Bahrain subjects. 2. I have little doubt that the situation is perfectly CLLrC+U* -&gt; correct^ Abdul Aziz went to Jedda with the thinly veiled intention of extracting some money from Bin Saud and it is obvious from other information I have received that he has completely failed. I have also noticed that the usual shipments on behalf of His Lajesty were not being made by the usaibis but were being made by other firms and news has been received of a consignment of 17,000 bags of rice due to be shipped shortly through Bahrain to the mainland under arrangements by Haji Abdulla Zainal,the brother of Luhammad Ali Zainal,who was formerly v aimmaqam of Jedda.IThis ccmsignraont is to be paid for in instalments,thou^i it is very doubtful that they will be any more successful in extracting payment that the all powerful v usaibis have found themselves to be* 3. The -usaibis are undoubtedly pledged to the hilt with Bin Baud and can ill afford to break with him,for any repudiation or delay in settling his debt of 17 lacs,coming on top of the sura they have lost in the inBolvency of Habib Rosenthal,may have a disastrous effect on them and render it difficult for them to pay the instalments due to pearl dealers in Bahrain. However foolish Abdulla may be,Abdul Aziz,the senior partner and creator of the firm,has great intelligence and I do not doubt that he vail find some means of bringing Bin Saud to terms even though it may take time,thou^a his task will be facilitated when the firms who are taking their place discover the difficulty in obtaining payment from their august client. I have the honour to be Sir, Your Most Obedient Servant, Political Agent, Bahrain.\ Extract from Iraq Command Intelligence Summary No. 13, dated 29th June 1932. REVDUT IN THE HEJAZ. 540 * Reference paragraphs 489, 490 and 491 of 1932. A further report received from Transjordan states that the rebel force, led by Hamid bin Rafadah, is nov^ spread along the coast between Haql (Sq. g. Ill) and A1 Haraiba (Sq. f. Ill ) ana its numbers have risen to about 1,100. The number of men with rifles is estimated at 400, but this number may be increased by the recovery of rifles said to have been hidden in Northern Hejaz by the refugees before they left the country. It is known that the first objective is Dhaba, but as yet the rebels have maae no combined movement and fought no actions. This long period of inactivity is not likely to improve their chanc-e -es of success 541. Ibn Saud has few troops in Northern Hejaz and the small garrison at Tabuk (Sq. f.iv ) Dhaba (Sq. g.iii) and Wejh (Sq. g.iv) are mutinous. In addition there is a serious shortage of stipplies and ammunition in these places. The King however has chosen Dhaba for his advance base, and on the 10 th June reinforced it to the extent of 20 armed cars carrying troops, about eighty five rifles and one thousand rounds of ammunition. A boatla(3h of foodstuffs was also landed. 542. Fortunately no Transjordan tribes have joined the rebel force and steps have now been taken by the Transjordan Government to prevent if necessary the Beni Attiyeh ( who migrated from Hejaz in i/iarch ) returning at this critical time. ( Authority H.Q., R.A.F., Transjordan and Palestine).Extract from 'Iraq Comnana Intelligence Summary No. 12, dated 15th June 1932. V. NEJD AND HEJAZ. Incipient revolt in the Heiaz . 489. A report received from the authorities in Transjordan at the end of last month stated that 400 Hejazis drawn from various tribes but with the Billi element jrjE&amp;sjsixxfcxxg preponderating, had crossed from Sinai into the Hejaz via Akaba with the announced intent- -ion of raising a revolt in the name of the Sherifian family against the Government of Ibn Saud. 490. This party, v/hich consists of Hejazi tribesmen who migrated into Egypt ana Lower Palestine since 1937, is at present under the leadership of Hamid bin Arfada ( (Rafadah) of the Billi tribe. They are well supplied Y/ith money in the form of Egyptian notes ( the origin of which is open to considerable speculation) but although their number has nov/ increased to some 700, appear doubt- -ful as to their subsequent reception and in no hurry to push further south into the Hejaz. They are at present ;ocated some 40 miles south of Akaba. 491. On 28th May His Highness the Amir Abdullah of Transjordan issued a proclamation disassociating himself Y/ith the movement, while in the .Hejaz Ibn Saud, who doubt- -less considers the influx of anybody with ready money a hopeful sign, has been in communication with the Amir of Lhada and ordered him to keep in close touch with any further movement of the self styjjed rebel party. ( Authority: A.H.Q., Palestine and Transjordan ).572* 573. ^aT-—'t - m SECRET. ^LV i iJ Extract from ’Iraq Command Fortnightly Intelligence Summary «“o.l4 of 13th July 1932. Rebel Forces in HEJAZ . Reference paragraphs 540, 541 and 542 of 1932. On 30th June, the advanced troops of Ibn Rafada’s party were located between BEDA (H.37.Sq.b. iv.} and H&amp;RAIBA (H.36.Sq.h.xi.) and were proceeding south. The force has been in Hejaz territory over five weeks and has made no effort to try conclusions with Government troops. An unconfirmed report states that this inactivity is according to plan; Ibn Rafad^s first role being to create sufficient diversions in Northern HEJAZ to cause re-inforcement of garrisons there with Government troops from MECCA, MEDINA and YENBO (G.37. Sq.h.v.), while the discontented tribes in these districts were to be encouraged by propaganda to rebel. These tribes are stated to be ready to revolt and a more active role must now be assumed by Ibn Rafada. The rebels are experiencing great difficulty in obtaining food supplies owing to the TRANSJORDAN authorities* closing the frontier to all cars, camels and men. (Authority* headquarters, TRANSJORDAN and PALESTINE) • Disposition of Ibn Sa*ud*s Forces . Ibn Sa*ud*s forces are reported as follows*- (a) DHABA (H.37.Sq.a.i.). 280 troops with 20 cars, machine guns and 1 field gun. (b) IfcJWEILA (G.38.Sq.a.xii). 120 troops with a few c©.chine guns. (c) TEBUK (H.37.Sq.h.ii). 70 troops, 7 cars and a &gt;. few machine guns*(Garrison inclined to be mutinous). (d) ....- 2 - 574. 3 (d) Ifan Sa*ud has also raised a force of Akhwan camelmen in UAJD. On 12th July, this force was reliably reported to be at EL ALA (G.37.Sq.c.v.) and the numbers were given as 1,490 men with 450 rifles. It is under the command of Abdulla ibn Aqayil. The object of this force may first be TEIMA (G.37.Sq. a.vi.}, where the governor has been flouting Ibn S&amp;^d^ authority for many years. (Authority* headquarters, TRANSJORDAN and PALESTINE). On 9th July, a Bedouin, who had accompanied a Najdi force from HAIL (G.38.Sq.a. i.) to MUSTA-JIDDA (G.37.Sq. c.xii), arrived in BAGHDAD, he said the force consisted of 14 standards ('baraiq') of Anaiza and Harb tribes and militia (**hathar w ), and that the whole was under the command of Abdulla ibn Aqayil. The force was concentrated at MUSTA- JIDDA on 27th June and he reported that Abdulla ibn Aqayil intended to march on TEIMA, where he understood the governor, Abdul Kerim ibn Rumman, had fortified the town and filled in the neighbouring wells for a distance of four camel days as a precaution against possible attack by Najdi forces. $he -Bedouin also added that it was common talk in the force that ibn Rumman, the Governor of TEIMA, had been giving money presents to shaikhs, including the Beni Atiyah, and that this money was from outside sources in EGYPT. He ended by saying that the force would wait at MUSTAJIDDA for ammunition from HAIL and would then proceed to TEIMA, arriving there on 9th July} the final destination was to be North HEJAZ which they ho|&gt;ed to reach about 15th July. The morale of the men in the force was only fair, but that of the leaders was high. (Authority* S.S.O. BAGHDAD). C omment . •. ♦-3- 575. 576. Comment . The information given by the Bedouin undoubtedly refers to the same force as that reported from Headquarters, TRANSJORDAN and PALESTINE. As this force went to EL ALA and not to TEIMA, it is more than probable that TEIMA is definitely fortified against Ibn Sa'ud’s men. In this connection, the following extract from the Head quarters, TRANSJORDAN and PALESTINE Summary of Intelligence No .6 of 1932, paragraph 59, is of interests 'Since the commencement of the Ibn Saoud regime, this town (TEIMA) has remained independent. Its governor, Abdul Karim ibn Rumman, has always refused admission to the King’s soldiers and officials, but nevertheless receives them hospitably in a guest tent outside the walls. These are twelve feet thick and are built of mud and sand. The town is dominated ny the governor’s fortified house on the tower of which are two machine guns and an old field gun. An ex-Turkish officer keeps these in order and has instructed the governor’s men intheir use”. VI. TRANSJORDAN . Disposition of Forces in TRANSJORDAN to meet the situation in HEJAZ . The High Commissioner for TRANSJORDAN has issued a proclamation stating that the Mandatory Power is deter mined to prevent assistance reaching the rebels in Northern HEJAZ, either from or through TRANSJORDAN. ’’SOUEORCE' was constituted on 16th June, with Headquarters at MA’AN (H.36.Sq*d.xii) and detachments of • • •-4- 577 0 at LUDOWARA (H*37 Sq.f .i),AKABA (E. 36.Sq. e.xi) ,TUTUN and S«ADI ER RETEM (E.H.36.Sq.e.xii). I n addition, a Palestine police post was established at A IE GHUDIAN (E,H. 36 Sq«o*xi) on 23rd June. The duties of this force are: (a) To co-operate with the Transjordan Police authorities in preYenting the passage of supplies or movement of re-inforcements through TRANSJORDAN to the rebel forces in HEJAZ. (b) In the event of the retreat of the rebel forces across the TRANSJORDAN frontier to: Cl) intercept as many rebels as possible and, if they refuse to turn back, to disarm and remove them away from the frontier area and to hand their leaders over to the Arab Legion for internment at MA’AN. Cii) repel any attempted incursions into TRANSJORDAN territory of Ibn Sa*udls forces. (Authority: headquarters, TRANSJORDAN and PALESTINE). Moyement^p f Tribes across Frontier into HEJAZ . Reference paragraph 542 of 1932. About 70 tribesmen of the Beni Atiyah succeeded in crossing the frontier in small parties by night for the purpose of co-operating with the rebels in Northern HEJAZ. (Authority: headquarters, TRANSJORDAN and PALESTINE).Q I? H T 5 t? Tl ■ - &gt; ^ w ;i .ii i . / i . olitical gent, .1 ah rain, the olst July 1932.

My dear Loch, In the course of a meeting yesterday Shaikh Yusuf Yaain mentioned that he had received a telegram from Ibn Saud some days before passing on a report by the Amir of Hasa, who in turn had received it from the Amir of Jubail, that about 3 p.m. on the 4th July the sound o| gun-gire (one shot I gathered) had been heard at Jubail, though it was not very distinct. Two days later a similar sound was heard about half an hour before sunset, but this time it was very much nearer. Ibn Saud had instructed him, Shaikh Yusuf said, to enquire whether there was any special reason for the gun fire, as, for example, were smugglers being pursued. In answer to my query, he said that there was no suggestion that Saudi territorial waters had been entered. He merely asked whether there was a reason for the firing and added that the Amir of Jubail was a new man in the post. I promised that I would make enquiries, and said that from my knowledge of sloops in the ied Sea it might possibly be some form of gunnery or firing practice. I should be grateful if you could give me any information on this matter. I am sending copies of this letter to Rendel, Metcalfe and Hickinbotham. Yours ever, sd. A.S. Calvert. Lt.

Baxter in which I mentioned x_bn Saud s reluctance, as reported hy the manager of the California Arabian Standard On Company, to allow a British -l a_.L-m uo establish itself on the mainland of Hasa* At the -l some repetition I now furnish a brief report on Ibn Sand's general attitude towards the Arab rulers in the ersian nalx Ig is ve _l j. Known that he has always resented his dependence on Bahrain if not on Kuwait as well, that ne despises the smaller shaikhs, and that he considers that the policy of Hi s Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom in the Persian Gulf has the effect of hemming him ' me curing the last year or two various new factors have been introduced into the problenf the discovery of -oil m various Arab territories; the increase in the influence of Iraq; movements in Arab territories which for conven ience can be described as democratic; and the real or simulated belief in some Arab circles that his Majesty's government are engaged in a ’’forward movement’' in the Guxf; and it will be convenient to make a brief survey of / the e Light Honourable the Viscount Halifax, K.G. ? Kc •. A o „ cvq ,the whole position in the light of these new factors. 2 , The personal respect which Ihn Sand has for • 'is highness the Shaikh of Bahrain was shown when the Crown Bpince of Arabia visited Bahrain a year ago and on the occasion of the return visit of the shaikh to the Bejaz shortly afterwards. Che king,when speaking to me about the visit, praised the Shaikh as an excellent man, and moreover of the sa w: tribal origin as himself, while the Anir Saud snoke of the difference between the Shaikh and the other Arab rulers, whom he described as rather Boeotian. Curing my recent visit to Riyadh Ibn Baud spoke with con- era about the Shaikh, whose position he considered was endangered by the Persian intrigues which in his opinion had caused the recent agitation. He became quite animated in his sympathy. There was the Bubara question too, he said^ that remained open.. I said I thought this question had been settled (l did not say that the decision of His tajesty’s Government was not to support the Bahrain claim), but the Ring said it was by no means settled. This was the first reference to the Bubara question since the conversati with Buad Hamza which I reported in my despatch No. 1 (222/469/3) of February 1 st., 1938,. except that some months ago one of the fecca newspapers printed an obscure paragranh which did n^t mention Bubara by name but referred to what could only be the 2 -nbara disnute and alleged that it had been exacerbated by the discovery of oil at the place concerned * 3. If there was nothing novel in the King’s praise of the Shaikh of Bahrain on this recent occasion? to hear nim praise the Shaikh of Kuwait was certainly quite new. Hitherto we have always been given to understand that he / re gardedregarded the Shaikh responsible for the Sau di A rabia« Now, as the leader a gang of smugglers loss of an immense annual revenue to however, I was told of the tradition al bonds between Ibn Saud and Kuwait, and assured of his desire for the maintenance of the Shaikh s nosit ion and dignity; and was asked to eynedite the conclusion of that Saudi-Kuwait Agreement for which he had previously shown so lit tl enthusiasm. vear or two years ago the ' Saut al hejaz' would not have published the article on Kuwait which appears in the issue of December 6th. This article begins' ‘Kuwait, is a pure Arab country distinguished by its mildness and tranquinty. -ts peonle arc known for their Arab nobility of character, which they have in herited from their honourable ancestors' 1 . I n my above- ~mentioned despatch I tried to provide some explanation for this change of attitude, and suggested as the Prin cipal causes a growing realisation that Kgs Tanura may be less successful than was hoped; suspicion of Iraq.; and apprehension at the movement in Kuwait which has resulted in the establishment of a council to assist in the government- of that territory, dt is early to give a decided opinion about has Tanura? and it might perhaps be -justifiable to draw t^e opposite conclusion, viz, that zhc possession of a port of his own made Ibn Saud believe 7 ,hat few if any imports would now come in through mv/ait; but it is certain, that the other two considerations have had some influence on Ibn °aud s mind. Ihe course of ev ents in Kuwait has not been in accordance with his con- eeptlon of constitutional procedure in an Amh and a hosiers state Some time a no he told, me that he listened / toto the advice of his -people and then governed in accord ance with the principles of Islam, and he assented to my suggestion that his country was under a religious con stitution. There is no doubt that although he takes his own decisions he does listen to the opinions of the ul^ma and of the tribal shaikhs; hut he thinks it wrong that the °haikh of Kuwait should have to listen to a ,f self- -appointed' council containing elements which, in Ibn Saud's opinion, are far from having the necessary pres tige ,r position. B ut, says Ibn hgua, it would have been paxte proper for the Shaikh to summon men of position to form a council and to ask their advice. z±,v _ ^ -^tist repeat that Ibn Sgud apologised, when I made some deprecating remark, for speaking about the in ternal affairs of Bahrain and K uwa it, an d explained that oe was thinking of ; his own position which might be affected by that of his -neighbours. Ibn s aud was indignant at what he had heard of |Iraqi designs on Kuwait-. The efforts made by the Iraq Gw^mment this year to draw tighter the commercial, finan cial and military bonds with 3 a udi ^rdbia'have not weakened hxs suspicions, and their desire to have a port at Kuwait - perhans as a prelude to absorption - is the last straw. Be did not refer to Iraqi propaganda elsewhere, but it was no doubt present to his mind, for Ap a bic newspapers have referred more than once to the populations of the minor Arab states in the &amp;ulf as looking towards Iraq. Ibn S au d’s jealousy of Iraq has been exacerbated recently by the ra uher flamboyant statements made by the Iraqi Minister for foreign Aff a j_ rs about Palestine on his return from London, and past as he is trying to prove, by his negotiations in taonne c t ionconnection with the forthcoming London discussions, that, h gc; as he/claimed in so many words, it is he and not ’'certain others” who is the leader of the A ra h world, so he may he wishing to counteract Iraqi influence in the Gulf hy con cluding the K uwa it Agreement, thereby enhancing the posi tion of the Shaikh and emphasising the importance of the relations between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. 6 , Ibn Gaud made no reference to the minor Arab rulers during my visit to Kiyadh, but I'uad Hamza asked me, obviously on instructions and with much earnestness, about the possibility of a solution of the eastern frontier 4 dif ficulty. Moreover when the Ki ng was deprecating hostile action against the Yemeni forces in Spabwa, kuad said that our action would inevitably be linked up in the public mind with what' is regarded as our 'forward policy” in the Persian ^ulfo dhen called unon to define this policy he could only say that some Arabs attributed the establish ment of the council in Kuwait to the British, who had found the Gpaikh too independent and desired to have a more subservient instrument, and refer to a movement in the direction of councils in some of the minor sheikh doms « I'uad did not pretend that he himself held any such belief, and admitted that he had brought back from Kuwait, where he stayed on his way from Bagdad, a more reasonable theory; but it is admitted that His Majesty’s Government have thought it necessary to extend and strengthen their control in the Hadhramaut, and Arabs cannot be blamed if they look foi* signs of a similar nrocess nearer home, Ibn Gaud has no love for the minor shaikhs, least of all for ' the Gnaikh of hatar, but a general movement towards the / reductionreduction of the stntus of rollers could not he nleas- ing to him. 1 io low orinion of the young men in the iiejaz who are sunposed to desire the modernisation of Saudi h-rahia has heen exnressed more than once, and he would naturally regret the annearance at his door, in however rudimentary a form, of a system which he is resolved not to see established in his own country- 7. inally, in srite of his general desire t o ‘work with - 'is i aiesty s Government, and of his assertion that, on grounds of security, he would rather have the British as his neighbours than the A m i r Ahdullah 'or the Iraq. Gov ernment, he would certainly not welcome an increase in __ p ** Vi British control in the territories of his -^rab neighbou Be .must be well aware of the tendency of European control in eastern countries to spread, and of; the keenness of the competition for oil-bearing lands, and the unfortunate course of the Bbbal I akhsh affair seems'to have caused him to believe that our nolicy in the Persian Gulf is in fluenced by oil interests. I do not doubt therefore that in conversation with hr. -^enahan he did show some reluct ance to allow a British firm to establish themselves at has Tanura, which is to he the port for the shipment of lL asa oil. In the end the unique position which -essrs. Gray hackenzie already hold in the G u lf, and the facilities which, they are consequently in a position to offer, should enable them to secure the permission they require, but they will have much suspicion to live down. It is to be expected teat Ibn Gaud’s attitude towards them will be influenced not only by what happens in the Gulf, but by the result of the 11 on don discussions on Palestine and ever perhaps the &amp;.lL£ / outcome■Mi 0 -atcomc of t ,, An Kl° Yemeni dispute about Shabwa and Abr. Our position will be none the easier if, as is reported &gt; y ' i±e ^ lusty 1 s ^assy at Bagdad, there is to be a German mission at Gedda, unless the Germans are so foolish as to overdo their propaganda - a great mistake where Ibn S a ud is concerned. It is to b e hoped that the Hansa hine,'who aie saici to have heen raking strenuous efforts to estfel*- Irsh themselves at Bahrain, will not succeed in their attempt to :ohtain permission to extend their activities ' to the mainland.

Nc/. 231 (Foreign Office numhe r E 246/246/25) in which Bullard reports on Ihn Sand’s general attitude to the Arab Rulers in the Persia# Gulf. I enclose for your information a copy of a ddmi-official letter from iowle commenting on the despatch and suggesting that explanations might he given to Ihn Saud or his representative at a convenient opportunity to dispel any apprehensions which Ihn Saud may entertain that we intend to pursue a 'forward policy' in the Gulf States which would threaten the independence of the Rulers, or that we took a hand in setting up the executive councils in Koweit and Dehai to which in principle Ihn Saud strongly objects. We think it would do good if Bullard were to speak on the lines suggested, and if you agree perhaps you would encourage him to do so? •L. Baggallay, Esq., Foreign Office, S.W.l. Yours ever, (SgcO J. P, GHJQOWConfidential D.O. No* C/200-A Dated the 28th March 1939. I understand that it is now pretty definite that Ibn Saud is coming to Dharan and ^Ras Tanura for the opening of the port at the latter place about the 1st of May. His Highness the 3haikh sent him a telegram the other day inviting him to come over to Bahrain but received an extremely polite refusal, saying that the King was very sorry that he had not sufficient time. He did not invite Shaikh Hamad to Has Tanura, but His Highness made up his mind that he must go across and see Ibn Baud even without an invitation. Strenuous efforts have been made by the amily and everyone to stop him; for everybody knows that Ibn Saud has a very high regard for Shaikh Hamad and the fact that he has not invited him for the opening ceremony is obviously due to the lack of facilities either at Dheran or at Has Tanura and to Phe short time that the King will be there; and, of course, an uninvited descent would be open to all sorts of misconstruction. As a result, the Shaikh is, I understand, sending a second invitation to Bahrain, and it is quite possible that Ibn Saud will now accept. I presume that this is all in order as it would only be a friendly visit and, apart from expense, ! see some advantage po Bahrain in a visit from Ibn Saud at this moment. There is bound to be expense any way as His Highness has ordered new cars to send across as a gift to Ibn Saud, — and we shall have to do our oest to ensure that he pays for them himself. 2 /- Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.B., C.B.B., Political Resiient in the Persian Sulf, Bushire.nz°) - 2 - 2, Abdul Aziz al osaibi, Ibn Saud 1 s agent here, came to visit me this morning and indicated that he proposed to suggest to Ibn Saud that he should invite me to attend this opening ceremony. Naturally I discouraged him, for much as I should like to meet Ibn Saud I cannot have Oosaibi arranging things in this way and there must certainly be no possible loop-hole A for the idea that I had been cadging an invitation. v' 3. I can find practically no correspondence in this Agency about Ibn Saud*s visit in 1930. The only reference on record seems to be Prior’s confidential letter No. 1.8 dated the 5th March 1930, which gives me no information about prior arrange ments or about the action expected of the Political Agent. If by any chance there is more on record in your office might I borrow the file in case Ibn Saud does come ?Confidential n.O. No. C/212-1.a/4 Dated the 1st April 1939. The mail has been delayed and T have just time to let you know, with reference to my demi-official letter No. C/200-dated the 28th larch 1939, that Ibn Saud has now telegraphed accepting shaikh Hamad's invitation to him to come to Bahrain after the ^as Tanura opening ceremony. The Shaikh, of course, is delighted, and the Pamily are at any rate relieved that this will prevent him from following out the somewhat undignified plan of going across to las Tanura even without an invitation. 2. The King has also telegraphed to 'ibdul Aziz al °osaibi asking him to inform the Bhaikh that he accepted the invitation on condition that His Highness gave him no presents. Of course there will be presents, but still it is a very unusual message to send. 3. As far as I can discover the final dates for the las Tanura ceremony have not yet been fixed, but Ibn 3aud will presumably be here sometime in the first week of lay, and locally it is expected that he will stay three days. If t ils is right there will be no opportunity for me to give a dinner for the King, but I shall be grateful for any Instructions in regard to offers of hospitality and courtesies generally.

He should also take any opportunity of extending courtesy to His Majesty e*g by entertainment at Agency* He should at his discretion impress Shaikh of desirability of avoid ing political discussions except in presence of Political Agent.

General position with regard to Shaikh of Kuwait’s relations with foreign Rulers is somewhat different to that of Shaikhs of Bahrain and Trucial Coast (including qatar). Latter, by their treaties can have no communication with foreign Rulers and therefore inferentially should not pay or receive visits without sanction of His Majesty’s Government. There is nothing preventing communications with foreign Rulers in our agreements with Shaikh of Kuwait (in this connection see correspondence my &lt;1, r,/-* |k ending with akk letter No.388-3 of 27th April 1934), 2. In these circumstances we cannot demur at visit and I agree with paragraph 1 of your telegram under reference. 3. Dickson telegraphs that if he does not receive message from Shaikh that King intends visiting Kuwait he will follow Shaikh to Ibn Baud’s camp on 30th January. Dickson is an old personal friend of the King and a private visit therefore to His Majesty’s camp is quite natural. Important.

To - The Hon* ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Viait of H«MoXing Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia to Kuwait. With reference to my telegram No.48-a, dated the 7th February 1936, I have the honour to submit the following report on the visit here of the King of Saudi Arabia. His Majesty King Abdul Aziz after a show of proper reluctance to impose himself on Kuwait, wets persuaded by the Shaikh, who went out to see him, to enter Kuwait territory as his guest, on the 30th January. 3 0 The Political Agent (Colonel H.R.P.Dicks on) went out some little way to meet his party as it came in. This is courtesy in accordance with local ideas, which for some obscure reason or superstition avoids meeting or seeing off visitors at Town gat es• 4. The subject of any private political discussions which may have taken place between the Shaikh and the King are still undivulged. No official conversations took place. 5 0 The King^ visit was generally said to be due to a desire to be near at hand to Shaikh Yusuf Yassin, who is engagsd in conversations in Bagdad in connection with the Pact of Non- Aggression (Turkey-Persia, Iraq-Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan) and possibly in addition on a side agreement between Iraq and Sir / Saudi3audi Arabia only; also to return the visit which was owing to the Shaikh of Kuwait who visited Riyadh in 1932. 6© Hurrying couriers passed frequently between Kuwait and Bagdad throughout the King^ visit, while on the other hand His Majesty and his entourage produced an atmosphere of cordiality and unexpected brightness in Kuwait. 7 # His Majesty seemed particularly well although he alleged a severe attack of some internal trouble while travelling. He was in a quite romping and very lavish mood. 8 0 His presents included an order for several new Ford cars from Basra for the Shaikh, Ha. 1500 to the poor of Kuwait and a very handsome sum to Jassim al Yacoub, the Shaikhs Palace Agent and the Shaikh’s servants. 9 0 In return every man of the party which numbered six hundred and seventy five (who travelled in 145 motors) was given his *KISWa h , i*e&lt;&gt;cloak and complete outfit and thirty rupees. 10 » Among the royal party were the 2mir Muhammad, son Smir Khalid, son Kmir Mans our, son Bmir Saud al Arafa, brother-in-law Dr. Pakhri, Shaikh al Ardh Abdur Rahman ash Shuwaish, Chamberlain Ibrahim al Jumaia, Secretary. 11. His Majesty Is romping mood showed itself in much jocularity at the various parties he attended and included the throwing into the sea of two Ikhwan Mollas, who were later suitably rewarded for being victims of this royal horseplay- 12. His Majesty is credited with having married twice during hia week’s stay, first to Mausa, a daughter of the late Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait and secondly - information is less certain here - to the daughter offered by an Nafisi, the King’s agent3 in Kuwait, a girl whose youth and beauty is said to amply make up for any lack of lineage* 13. His Majesty accepted invitations from The Political Agent (Colonel Dickson), Shaikh Ali al Khalifa (cousin of Shaikh), Shaikh Abdulla al Jabir (son in law of Shaikh), Sibdulla an Hafisi (Saudi Arab Agent), Mulla Salih (Shaikh^s Secretary), Hilal al Mutairi (the rich pearl merchant, whose presents included many jewelled and gilded arras) but it is understood, refused, at the Shaikhs suggestion, two invitations from Sabah an Nasir, grandson of Shaikh Mubarak# 14. The Political Agent (Captain de Saury), accompanied by colonel Dickson, chief Local Representative of the Kuwait Oil Company, visited His Majesty, with whom was the shaikh, on 6th February, and subsequently accompanied the party as it left, some little way on the road# 15. The Shaikh accompanied the King, as a courtesy and in order to hunt with him on and about the frontier. His Majesty expected to reach Jarya al Liya on about the 9th February, and the Shaikh to return to Kuwait about the same day. 16. The general impression created by the visit was excellent. The town was en fete and the shopkeepers found it a financial windfall very much to their liking, because this Wahabi party bought up every bottle of scent in the bazaar, much silk, 40 gramaphones, every record available, tobacco in great quantity, many so maunds of coffee, all Ford spares, and^/much petrol that there was none left in Kuwait. 17. His Majesty left a Kuwait happier for his coming, / and4- and this may not have been the least of his objects in view. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, sd.

There is rumour (which I am trying to verify) that the Shaikh of Qatar is also going and the A1 Khalifah think that possibly Ibn Saud (either of his own accord or on request of the Shaikh of Qatar) will try to patch up Bahrain - Qatar quarrel. His Highness asks for advice what to do if this occurs. 2. Presumably we need not demand that Ibn Saud's mediation be refused provided no territorial questions are raised and there is no trespass on our Treaty position. 3.

Dear Baxter You will have seen a copy of the confidential letter D.O.No. 1C5-3, which Bowie sent to Peel on January 23rd, on the subject of Ibre Baud’s attitude towards the Arab rulers of the Persian Gulf. I spoke to Shaikh Yusuf Yasin a few days ago in the sense of this letter, pointing out that we had refrained from inter fering in the internal policy of the Shaikhs, and that the establishment of administrative councils at Kuwait and Dubai had been due to disregard of our advice to set up advisory councils to act as safety valves. Yusuf Yasin said that the King had a double interest in the matter: he did not wish anything to happen which would expose His Majesty’s Government to criticism, and he wished the personal position of the Shaikhs to be maintained. Yusuf Yasin has doubtless repeated to Tbn Baud what I told him, but he has not sent any comment. During the last few days 1 have been discussing the to point out how very much Saudi policy towards Kuwait during the last few years had weakened the King’s position as between Saudi Arabia and Iraq. The Iraq propaganda for the annexation of Kuwait had drawn from the King the quite accurate statement that Kuwait meant more to Saudi Arabia than to Iraq; but suppose Iraq said that as Saudi Arabia had got on without Kuwait for so long, she had proved ths»t Kuwait was of no suspicions of Kuwait, both as a home for smugglers and as a Kuwait Agreements with Shaikh Yusuf, and I took the opportunity interest to her ? But I have no doubt that I bn baud’s / possible B.v.Baxter Esq.,M.G Foreign Office /possible soutrce of political intrigue, have been very strong, and they are not necessarily weaker now: only, the other considerations .yhich I suggested in the despatch on which J’owle has commented would seem to have tipped the balance the other way.

Weightman, Esquire, I.C.S., Political Agent, Bahrain. To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Subject i- Visit of Ibn 3aud to Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to submit the following report on the visit of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud to Bahrain from the 2nd to the 7th May 1939. It will be appreciated that this report has been written on the day of the King's departure and that there has been insufficient time to collect much gossip from the Palace or the bazaar. The report is therefore based almost solely on my personal observations. 2. On the 1st May 1939 the Amir Saud arrived in Bahrain from A1 Khobar by launch and on the same day the Amir Feisal arrived from Cairo by air. The latter had chartered an Imperial Airways' aeroplane from Egypt and brought with him Shaikh Hafiz Wahba and Shaikh Jemal Husseini who had been summoned by Ibn Saud for a discussion on Palestine. I paid an informal call on the Amirs the same evening and the following morning they crossed to A1 Khobar by launch, in company with the brothers of His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain and his eldest son, Shaikh Salman, in order to escort the King to Bahrain. The King arrived in the late afternoon with a huge party of relatives /-- 2 - j/'V* 1 foo relatives, Ministers, Amirs, Political detenus and retainers, and was met on the Customs pier by His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain, Mr. Belgrave, myself and the Assistant Political Agent. The arrival was admirably staged and an excellent guard of honour provided by the Bahrain Police was inspected before Ibn Saud and His Highness entered an open car to drive to the Palace in Manama where the remainder of the A1 Khalifah Family and the notables of Bahrain had assembled to greet him. At this point the King performed the first of many acts of cordiality towards myself by insisting on my accompanying him in his car, although I had intended to take leave of him at the pier. After a brief stay at the Palace in Manama the King and His Highness the Shaikh motored to Hafa* a where a Palace recently constructed by His Highness* son, Shaikh Salman, had been placed at Ibn Saud*s disposal. 3. On the following morning the Bahrain Police gave a short display before Ibn Saud, followed by Arab dancing; in the afternoon the King, the Amir Saud, the Amir Feisal and several other sons and members of the entourage, together with Shaikh Hamad and the leading members of the A1 Khalifah came to a garden party at the Agency. The whole party was in excellent spirits, and the King cracked several Rabelaisian jokes; while at intervals he made extremely offensive remarks about the German Chancellor and Signor Mussolini. He reminded me that the ex-Kaiser Wilhelm had in 1914 claimed to be the Sword and Protector of Islam — and had come to a bad end; and he added, it was interesting to observe that Signor Mussoli ni is now using very much the same language and will probably go very much the same way l He said that he was thankful that he had been able to put an end to the Italian connection with his 'Air Force' by making the excuse that he felt he ought to send his young men to Egypt for training. 4 /-W ' (til) 4. Cn the following morning I was enabled to pay a formal call at r afa*a on His Majesty who had with him only the Amir Saud and Shaikh Hafiz Wahba. The interview lasted half an hour and I found an opportunity to tell the King something about the abortive agitation which occurred in Bahrain last autumn. His Majesty said that he knew well that it had been entirely foreign in origin and he proceeded to blame Iraq for the trouble it causes in neighbouring States by its press and wireless propaganda. The disturbances in Dubai were also mentioned and the King made it very clear that his sympathies were entirely with Shaikh Said bin Maktum. He then said that he wished to give me some friendly advice — never to believe any news from the Coast unless I had verified it myself. He thought that much of our difficulty with the ooast.al Shaikhs in the past had been due to inaccurate infor mation from our previous Agent there, and he added that he himself had much the same trouble with some of his outlying districts. He wished to assure me that on more than one occasion he had advised Trucial Coast Shaikhs to place their trust in the British and to cease making stupid difficulties in regar ~ to air facilities and so on. His Majesty was politely enthusiastic about Bahrain and the admirable relations which exist between the A1 Khalifah and ourselves; and at this point he said that there was one matter which he wished i to mention as the friend of all parties concerned. He had intended to raise it with Sir Header Bullard if the latter J had been able to come to Bahrain but he thought it would be proper to speak to me about it. He had been much criticised for not attempting to make peace between Bahrain and Qatar* I it was a stupid and unnecessary quarrel and ought to be ended. In the subsequent pause I remarked that I also was greatly concerned at this quarrel and was constantly on the watch for/--4- for an opportunity to initiate a settlement, I thought that both sides were still a little too hot, but I should be immensely grateful for any advice which His Majesty could, in his wisdom, give me. The King then closed this part of the discussion by saying that he hoped to hear before long that a settlement had been reached. I expected the next subject to be Jebel Naksh and Khor-el-Odeid, but he then turned to a discussion on oil , making it evident that in his view the California Arabian Standard Oil Company did not have his interests at heart. He was thankful that at last some progress had been made by them, but after all he needed oil royalties very badly and they were only just beginning to come in in very minor sums. Fortunately he still had other large areas in his country uncovered by existing concessions and these would not go for nothing. I might add here that I gather the impression thrtlhe whole Dammam visit has been somewhat unsatisfactory; the King would not follow the programme which had bean arranged; he arrived at a banquet organised by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company and left inside three minutes; he com plained to Shaikh Hamad in my hearing that on one occasion he had been compelled to chase food unsuccessfully all around the table with a spoon and fork; and altogether he appears to have reacted somewhat violently to the American passion for schedule. 5. To revert now to the course of events in Bahrain. On the afternoon of the 4th May a formal entertainment was given by the Manama and Muharraq Municipalities in the Manama Municipal Garden. The proceedings, once they began, were comparatively brief, being confined to short speeches of welcome read on behalf of His Highness the Shaikh and the Presidents of the two Municipalities and a reply read on behalf /-5- rtl o behalf of the King by Shaikh Yusuf Yasin. The sentiments expressed were in all respects admirable, the King*s speech referring to ’’this Arab Island under its Arab Huler', Though it would be foolish to imagine that the King had any parti cular motive, this part of the speech was a potent reply to those who talk of British domination and colonisation in Bahrain or the dictatorship of the British Adviser. 6. On the following day, Friday, the King joined in the prayers at the Mosque in Manama. In the afternoon he paid a visit to the Oil Field and Befinery, during which Mr. Belgrave and I accompanied him in his car and were com pelled to assume the role of oil experts. During much of the drive however His Majesty held forth on politics; after a brief reference to M. Litvinoff* s departure from the scene in Russia and a remark that he wished he knew what this meant, the King embarked on a long statement of his dislike for Germany and Italy and their hectoring methods. He said that Herr Grobba had told him recently that Germany and Italy were stronger than the rest of Europe put together, that the Democracies were afraid of them and that he, Ibn Saud, would be well advised to link his fate with the Axis. He himself however had not the least doubt that if war broke out in Europe there would be revolution in Germany and Italy whose people must, he said, be sick of 'having their tongues held'. He then went on to deprecate modern tendencies in Iraq. Iraq, he said, seemed to be composed of three quite irreconcilable elements, the Government, the $rmy and the People. Everyone was in far too much of a hurry and Iraqi foreign policy was deplorable. Ke himself thought that they would all do well to remember how much Arab nations owed to England. But for England the Iraq State would never have come into existence and Egypt would have been at the mercy/-mercy of any odd minor power, such as Greece. How happy was Bahrain under its Arab Shaikh, enjoying the protection of England -- and at this stage point was given to his remarks by the sight ox the battery of tanks at the Oil Company 1 s Refinery. From there on his interest was mainly in statistics of tons of oil, tanks and wells* He stopped at the Power House at the Refinery and was obviously impressed, but worried by the noise. Later on, at tea, he wMspered to me that he heard that the Bahrain Petroleum Company were to get a concession for the Unallotted Area of Bahrain, and said he would be very grateful if I would let him know in due course what the terms were as these would help him a great deal in his own concession al negotiations 1 I thought it well to make it clear that we did not settle the terms and were concerned only to see that Shaikh Hamad received fair treatment from the Company. 7. It struck me on this, as on other occasions, that he seemed extremely anxious to show publicly the good will which he entertained for the British. He made me sit by him on all public occasions and would not tolerate any attempt on my part to retire into the back-ground* He was equally cordial to Mr. Belgrave and made a particular point of thanking him personally for all the arrangements which had been made for his entertainment. 8. On the earlier nights the banquets given by His Highness the Shaikh and his brothers (for which the State pays) had been restricted solely to Arab guests. On Friday and Saturday nights however a few European guests were also invited and received most kindly attention from the King. 9. On Saturday morning the King visited a few of the more important Nejdi traders in Manama and also had his eyes tested. (Dr. Kennedy tells me that it is merely a matter of giving/.Hi) 10/- — 7 — giving him slightly stronger lenses). After dinner the King attended a torch-light Tattoo in which the Bahrain Police, some of the town watchmen and a number of school-children took part. It was an admirable production for which great credit is due to Mr. Belgrave, who was solely responsible for its organisation. Meanwhile I had arranged through Shaikh Hafiz Wahba that the King would give me a private audience after the Tattoo, and at this I solicited Shaikh Hafiz* s assistance in reading to him two messages and a memorandum from His Majesty* s Government in regard to Palestine. There had been insufficient time after the arrival of the telegrams (in very corrupt form) from the Foreign Office to do more than make a rough translation, but the English and Arabic versions were faired during the night and handed to His Majesty when he left Bahrain this morning. As I have reported separately, Ibn Saud said that he was unable to make any com ment immediately, but that he would study these papers in detail on arrival at A1 Khobar and, if he wished to send any message or require further elucidation from His Majesty’s Government, he would write to me at once. Explaining the presence of Shaikh Jemal Husseini, he said that he had re ceived many kindnesses from the British Government and that, now that they were in difficulties, he wished to do what he could to help them. He had sent messages to the Palestine Arab Leaders to prepare for a settlement and had asked that Jemal Husseini be sent to him for a discussion since he re garded him as probably the most intelligent amongst them. Ibn Saud It was probably an unusual experience for b&amp;R to sit with only two companions in a large and empty palace late at night, and with no more than two Policemen and two of his own fidawis outside.10. The King and his entourage left Bahrain this morning after the most affectionate farewells and pressing invitations to visit him at Riyadh. I have not yet received full infor mation of the presents which have been given by Shaikh Hamad but they include 21 motor cars, 50 camels and 20 horses. Other gifts include Rs* 30,000 for the King’s servants, though as a cheque for this amount was presented to Shaikh Abdullah Sulaiman the ultimate disposal of the money remains in doubt. The lianama bazaar is half denuded by the immense purchases made by the Saudi entourage and a fleet of boats is at present carrying these purchases across to A1 Khobar. I shall report more fully on the financial aspect of the visit at a later date. 11. According to information received so far, no political questions affecting Saudi - Bahrain relations were discussed with the Shaikh or his Family. The King did, it is true, enquire from Mr. Belgrave whether it would be possible to release from jail one of the prisoners convicted of complicity in last October’s disturbances, but this enquiry seems to have been prompted by the fact that the man had at one time been a nakhuda in Ibn Baud* s own employment. A roundabout request also reached me to release a Nejdi whom X had imprisoned for rash and negligent driving but I declined to do anything unless the King himself mentioned the matter. Bazaar rumours heard so far relate mainly to the Amir Feisal, - one of them referring to his impending elevation to the throne of Palestine. 12. The effect of this visit has been wholely admirable locally and will, I am convinced, have excellent results in a much wider sphere. The King has seen for himself the rela tions which exist between the Al Khalifah Family, the Agency and the Adviser; he has spoken publicly of his great pleasure in all that he has seen in Bahrain; he has exhibited equally publicly/--9- publicly (and at a time when there are many visitors from other Moslem States in Bahrain) the most marked cordiality towards British officials here; and further proof has been given of the personal affection which exists between the King and Shaikh Hamad of Bahrain. I am sure that he has enjoyed his visit, and certainly Shaikh Hamad, his brothers and sons are delighted beyond measure. Indeed it is difficult to realise, after the events of the past few days, that only nine years ago the Political Agent in Bahrain reported after Ibn Saud* s last visit to the Island that f, the whole effect of this visit has been deplorable. A more successful impetus to pan-Arab feeling could not have been given and the tenuity of our hold on Bahrain could not have been more clearly demonstrated.•*••••••••••• Ihe futility of the A1 Kha iiah Shaikhs in their own dominions has been amply demonstrated....” This present report might end with a quotation from Ion Saud*s own words to Shaikh Hafiz Wahba t 'In my own country I lose my temper not less than once in three here in Bahrain I cannot imagine how I could ever lose it.' fortunately the weather was cool. lS. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, I have just heard through Shaikh Mohammad bin * Isa, brother of Shaikh Sir Hamad, that Ibn Saud talked constantly to Shaikh Hamad and his relatives about world politics, and that time after time he impressed upon them the strength of his pro-British C7, sentiments. He said he might have his minor* differences with us but these were matters o; no account and that he was solid with the Br sdsh. / Political Agent, Bahrain,X No. t C/307-1. e/4 The Political Agent, Bahrain, Presents his compliments to: — X.

My Lord, I have the honour to submit a brief report on the situation as seen at Jedda. 2. The German attempt to represent the visit of Khalid al Gargani, the envoy of Ibn Saud, to Berlin as having great political significance did them more harm than good in the eyes of Ibn Saud, who has no wish to he tied to Hitler's chariot and to fly from known to unknown evils. It was reasonable that he should try to obtain from the Germans arms which we could not supply, especially if they were willing to grant favourable credits. Ibn Saud communicated to His Majesty’s Govern ment the correspondence in which his envoy related the progress of the negotiations with the Germans, and requested their advice when the Germans^asked for a neutrality agreement in return for the facilities promised. The advice being rather long in coming, he on his own initiative sent a polite refusal to enter into a neutrality agreement. It is interesting to learn that the Germans hastened to accept Ibn Saud ’ s point of view. Unless the correspondence communicated to us has been falsified (and there is no reason to believe this) Ibn Saud told the Germans openly that ^he Right Honourable the Viscount Halifax, K.G., &amp;C • &amp;C • &amp;c • / hishis interests prevented his taking any step which would involve him in difficulties with His Majesty's Government. The outbreak of war brought the negotiations to an end, and on September 13th. Ibn Saud send Khalid a telegram instructing him to return home. Khalid had not enough money for the return journey, and as Ibn Saud considered it impossible to send money to Sermanyhe instructed Khalid to go to some neutral country, preferably Switzer- land, where he could receive money from Saudi Arabia for the journey home. Khalid is said to be due here soon, but I have no official information on that point. 3. As Mr* Trott reported to you at the time, towards the end Khalid gained the impression that the Germans were not anxious to supply the arms in any case. If the Germans expected hostilities to break out soon, that might well he the case: they would need all the arms they could get; Ibn Saud could not he relied upon not to he sympathetic towards their enemy, Great Britain; and the foreign exchange to he paid for the arms in instalments would prohahly never reach them. Later, however, they seem to have heen keen to supply the arms, and the agreement was signed. Ihn Saud however seems to have taken it for granted that the outbreak of war destroyed all hope of his getting the arms. I have received your telegram No. 126 V f A: dated September 13th., in which it is stated that if the Germans are still willing to supply the arms without unacceptable conditions His Majesty’s Government see no reason why Ibn Saud should not take advantage of the offer, though as to the method of payment, about v/hich His Majesty’s Government could make suggestions, they would deprecate the transfer of gold to Germany. The agreement, / aa copy of which was transmitted in Mr. Trott's secret letter of September 6th. to Mr. Baxter, provides for the sale ten thousand Mauser rifles complete and ten 11011 0artrldges for th e sum of one hundred and nineteei thousand nine hundred anri Q-w-t- + nd sixty-two pounds three shillings ■ I,P ’ Jedda ’ payment ^ made in seven equal instal ments at dates from four to seventy-six months after delivery of the goods. was to he expected that when the German Minister was handed his passports by the Iraq Government - he would try to make for Saudi Arabia, where from the shelter of his other legation he might be a thorn in the side of the Allies, and in fact he applied to Ibn Saud permission to travel to Saudi Arabia by land from Kajaf, with several cars. Ibn Saud did not want to have Dr. Grobba in his country at all. He could not refuse to receive him altogether, since Dr. Grobba is accredited to him, but he found a good excuse for refusing to allow him to come by land; he alleged that the tribes on the route, excited by the talk of hostilities and particularly hy the news that Iraq had entered the war, might make some regrettable mistake. It was expected here that after reaching Syria Dr. Grobba would make an attempt to reach Jedda by sea, but I have no news of his movements or intentions. 5. ihe situation in Jedda is much more tranquil at present than I had reason to expect a year ago. It seemed almost certain that Italy would be against us if we went to war with Germany, and this would have turned Jedda into a centre of propaganda and brought the war much near-er to Ibn Saud. Moreover at that time it was not / foreseenfi &lt; \~y foreseen that a conference would result in the adoption by HlS Majesty ’ s Go vernment of a Palestine policy which not even the Arab extremists could deny to he an improve ment from their point of view, and which would enable the Arab states to side with us whole-heartedly in case European war. The Italian wireless broadcasts are carefully neutral, and the Italian Legation are not distributing any objectionable propaganda. Among certain sections of the populace the violent German broadcasts, professing love for the Arabs and disinterested wishes for their independence and their liberation from the Jews, are not without effect, but on £he other hand, it - is the pilgrimage that matters to Jedda and indeed to Saudi Arabia as a whole, and for that the country is largely dependent on Great Britain and not at all on Germany. Moreover, public opinion here has little or no effect upon Ibn Gaud, who steers his own course. 6. Ibn Saud defined his attitude in a message which was reported in the last paragraph of Jedda telegram No. 119 dated September 3rd., In this message V .,-j y rv Ibn Saud assures His Majesty’s Government that he would never give any undertaking or take any secret or open action with any Moslem or (other) foreign government which might damage British interests or affect his relations with His Majesty's Governmento This assurance is of a piece with Ibn Saud' s policy for many years past. He does not claim that he has any greater affection for us than any other non-Moslem foreigners, but only that his interests are in essence identical with ours. 7. It is early to say what course the war will take. The attitude of Italy and Turkey must naturally / bebS ° f grSat COn ° ern t0 Itn Sau ^ and what policy they eventually adopt is at present unknov.n. All that can he said is that for the moment the task of His Majesty's Legation in Jedda is easier than I expected it would he. Ihn Saud is impatient to see me to discuss matters of coranon interest, and in my telegram No. 123 dated September 13th. I suggested that in the first Place I should pay him a visit at Riyadh as an alternative he seems much to prefer to a suggestion that Captain de aury should visit him. It was I who originally proposed that if war broke out it might serve the interests of His Majesty’s Government well if ibn Saud would allow us to have a representative at Riyadh and suggested Captain de Gaury as the ideal officer for this purpose, but from the comments of Ibn Saud, some received before and some after the despatch of my telegram No. 123, it is evident that if this project is still desirable and is ever to be realised, it requires preparation by a visit from the Minister at Jedda which, as Ibn Saud says, would be generally considered natural and not, like a visit from Captain de Saury, a highly abnormal event. I am expecting to receive at any moment your instructions whether I am to go to Riyadh. 8. The Foreign Office were aware, before I left England, that Ibn Saud had decided to establish a legation in Paris and that Fuad Hamza had been selected for this post. My French colleague. Monsieur Ballereau, who is as active as his predecessor was supine, claims that this step has been taken as a result of his insist ence. He declares that the Qua! d f Orsay do not understand the Arab point of view, and that he urged upon the Saudi / Governmentr;' Government their* ... onsi ility to enlighten the French Government on this subject Tt . Ject ' is more than probable * bn Sand's main object is to urge the claims of 18 family t0 th6 throne ^ Syria and to counteract influence of the Sharifian family, but Monsieur Balleareau, whether conscious of that fact or not, did not allude to it. But whatever is behind the appoint ment, it can hardly fail to be advantageous to the Allies that the only legations maintained by Ibn Baud abroad should all be in allied countries - Great Britain, Prance, Egypt and Iraq. 9. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty's Ambassadors at Cairo ( P130/483/65 ) and Bagdad (2132/483/65), His Excellency the High Commissioner for Palestine (2133/483/65), His Excellency the Governor- General of the Sudan (2135/483/65), His Excellency the Governor of Aden Colony (2134/483/65), the Political Agents at Bahrain (2137/483/65) and Kuwait (2138/483/65), the Commissioner at Port Sudan (2136/48^/65), and to the Middle East Intelligence Centre at Cairo (2131/483/65.

On the return call I introduced the Senior Naval Officer who very kindly arranged for one of the sloops at the mouth of the Gulf to collect any message the Amir wanted to send to Ibn Saud, A message arrived yesterday morning and I passed it on to the King, 4* The Amir Saud was as charming as ever and even found time to visit the new Bahrain Government Hospital while he was here.

He was met at the aerodrome by Shaikhs Abdullah and Salman, Mr. Belgrave and myself and appeared in excellent health and to have enjoyed the flight. The plane cruised over Bahrain for some time before landing. Shaikh Hamad met the Amir at the end of the causeway and accompanied him to the Manama Palace. 2 . I called on the Amir at 9.50 A.M. on the 9th June 1940 and with him at the Palace were Shaikh Hamad, Shaikh Salman and Shaikh Da ! ij. After the Amir had said how much he had enjoyed the journey and how grateful he was to Government of India for the assistance given to him while in India Shaikh Hamad asked for the latest war news. I told him what I had heard on the last news•bulletin from London and mentioned the bombing by French planes of factories producing war materials in the suburbs of Berlin. The Shaikh appeared much perturbed by the whole situation and the Amir Saud reluctant to expand on the subject. The Amir asked me whether I had heard that the British Ambassador in Rome had left for London and also that Turkish troops had been sent to Syria to relieve French troops required in France. I said that I had not, and the idea of Turkish troops in Syria seemed to worry the Shaikh who enquired anxiously whether I thought President Inenu was a man who could be trusted. I said that I thought that Turkish relations with the Allies were excellent and gave no cause for worry. The discussion then centered on the influence of the Pope in Italy and the attitude of Russia if Italy interfered in the Balkans. The Amir had heard of the Russian broadcast to the effect that Russia would intervene on the side of the Balkans if Italy attacked any one of them but said that as it was not an official announcement his viewwas that no great attention should be paid to it. The Shaikh then announced that the object of German propaganda was clearly to create disturbances in as many places as possible which would require the presence of Allied troops for their suppression and which would result in the weakening of the Aliied Fo rces in France. The Amir agreed with this. The Amir then stated that although the position in France was serious he was quite certain that in the end the Allies would win. He further stated that if Italy entered the war ^ it was equally certain that America would come in on the side of the Allies. Much time was then spent in endeavouring to explain to bhaikh Hamad the position in relation to Germany of countries affected by the war. i 5. On arrival I informed the Amir that urgent work had made it necessary for the Political Agent to go to Iraq and before leaving him asked him to convey the P.A»s respects to 5 King Abdul Aziz Ibn baud. , 4.

Senior Naval Officer and Air Liaison Political - Officer informed© 1&gt;' P.O. s. o I beg to report the following details of the plot made for the overthrow of the present Saudi regime in Meades, according to information obtained by the follow 7 ers of Shaikh Muhammad bin T lsa who have recently returned from Saudi Arabia. Three of the heads of the Sha’rifite Family in the Hedjaz sat together and decided to make a plot for the overthrow of the Saudi kingdom and the proclamation of Amir Abdullah of Transjordan as King of Hedjaz. For this pur pose they proceeded to Cairo and met Amir Abdullah who was then visitng Egypt. They conferred with him and then returned to Mecca and started working out plans for carry ing out their plot. They held various meetings which last ed till late at night in an unsuspicious place and then decided to call Sharif Hazza T , an influential member of the Sharifite Family and a pro-Saudi and ask him to participate with them in the plot. They invited him to their meeting place and disclosed their intention to him. He disagreed with them and advised them not to indulge in such a grave matter as it was not desirable to do it in a time when world conditions are precarious. They refused to listen to his advice and threatened him with death if he hesitated to take part with them. Under pressure he agreed to fall in with their request but asked them to show him their documents and plans so that he may study them. They gave him the same and he at once went at midnight and reported the matter to Amir Faisal, the Regent of Ibn Saud. Amir Faisal immediately sent out a police force to the place of the conspirators in oroer to arrest them. They resisted the police and opened fire on them. The police retaliated; three of the conspirators were killed and the remainder Kaptured. Some ol the policemen were ; I j r % h rr/ 2 injured. From the documents it could be discovered that many persons were implicated in the plot and that the conspirators were well financed. Some of them were even living in remote places such as Hassa. Orders were issued for the arrest of all of them. There was a rumour also that Amir Abdullah intended to perform Hajj pilgrimage this year and that 5000 persons were intending to come to Mecca disguised as pilgrims, but in fact intended to conduct the coupe d’etat. Who they were and from where they intended to come nobody knows. The Saudi (jovernment is observing complete secrecy about this incident and it is said that Ibn Saud had requested the foreign powers not to publicise it, as it might prevent persons from performing pilgimage which might mean a great financial loss to him.

Following is outline of affair The income from certain wakfs of Aun in Hejaz is disputed amongst various members , grandsons of the late Sharif Aun. Funds were in charge of a certain Hassan Futbi, Agent of the family. With his connivance his assistant El Abid Ibn Hussain El Dhib stole the funds and distributed them amongst various Sharifs in and about Emef with object of setting on foot a conspiracy to wrest the Hejaz from Ibn Saud and set up a Sharifian rule. Principal conspirators were three b rothers of Aun family Abdul Hamid, Ali and Hassan. Five other Sharifs entered the plot but three of these informed against the rest and all the conspirators were arrested, El Abid Ibn Hussain El Dh.ib and Abdul Hamid were condemned to death but Abdul Hamid's sentence /-- 2 - [T15 sentence was commuted to imprisonment.

B, Wakefield His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent Manama, Bahrein Dear Sir: f' 4 . refer to your letter G/ 3^9 regarding a ship- ment of Lubricating oil to Jeddah for the Saudi Arab Govern ment • Xn early February we received a shipment of 800 - 55 gal- Ion drums of lubricating oil for the Saudi Arab Government. The Government required that 700 drums be shipped to Jeddah. We instituted an inquiry to our principals in San Francisco to arrange shipment. At about the same time the British Embassy at Jeddah opened inquiries to develop shipping space. «e assume that the telegram quoted in your letter is the result of this latter Inquiry. We have been advised by our principals that a shipment can be made to Suez in April for transhipment to Jeddah or a direct shipment can be made to Jeddah in June when we shall be shipping bulk gasoline from Bahrein. The Saudi Arab Govern ment has asked us to arrange to ship 200 drums to Suez in April provided they have been unable to close a pending nego tiation to purchase oil in the Red Sea area. The balance or all is to be shipped direct to Jeddah in June. Another order of oil has just arrived in Bahrein for the Saudi Government. Therefore there will be a total of 1250 - 55 gallon drums for shipment to Jeddah. This oil will require transportation from Al Khobar to Bahrein. The oil is ready for shipment at any time. If MWT have a ship scheduled to call at Jeddah in the near future it will be convenient for the Saudi Government to receive this oil. If, however, the shipment requires divert ing a vessel from some other service it is my opinion that the urgency of the requirement may not justify such diversion. I leave to your good judgment whether or not negotiations with MWT should be continued or dropped. Tours very truly, CALIFORNIA ARABIAN STANDARD OIL COMPANYConfid»nti»i D.C. No .C/477. Political Agancy, Bahrain, 7th April 1943* \ I enclosa in triplicate, in case it ««y b« of interest to you or others, a note of what Dr.Storm and Mr. Van Peursem told me about their recent tour in Saudi Arabia. I i v Yours sincerely, The Honourable Lieutenent Colonel.C*G.Prior. ,c.I.E*, Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf, Cam P BAHRAI Nuonditions in Saudi Arabia , &gt; i ( Dr. Storm and Mr. Van Peursem of the American Mission at Bahrain have recently returned from a medical tour in Saudi Arabia in the course of which they spent six weeks in Riyadh. Mr. Van Peursem reports that, so far as he could see, food, including rice, was plentiful. He said that prices were high hu't 'that* 5 as “the labouring and servant classes received their pay in food, the high prices did not greatly affect them. He saw no signs of starvation and heard no complaints about lack of food* 2* Dr* Storm confirmed what Mr. Van Peursem had told me independently. He thought that the general condition of the people was good* The only persons who appeared to be suffer ing were the Bedouin whose flocks and camels were in poor condition owing to lack of grazing during past seasons. He said that there were very few beggars in Riyadh and that the •suq* there had many things not available in Bahrain e.g* soap, toilet requisites and similar articles of every day use. 3. Dr. Storm said that everybody in Riyadh appeared to be in good spirits as a result of the excellent war news. He said that general feeling was in favour of the Allies. Hatred and contempt of Italy were universal. There appeared, however, to be apprehension about Russia’s future policy and power. Ibn Saud mentioned to Dr. Storm during each of five or six interviews his expectation that Russia would demand a commercial outlet on the Gulf after the war. According to Dr. Storm views in Riyadh about Russia had been greatly influenced by the fate which had befallen a Russian diplo matic or consular representative at Jedda and a Russian lady doctor there. It is believed in Riyadh that these two Russians were ’’put out of the way” on their return to their country because they did not hold advanced communist views. 4. Dr. Storm said that Bashir Syed Alawi is the closest to the King of his counsellors and has most influence with him./'-biou yod Alwai has strong feelings about the intervention of foreigners in Saudi Arabian affairs. Though he considers all foreign influence evil he thinks the British are less to fr® oistrusted than other foreigners# 5. Dr. Storm was amazed at the way in which the King, in spite of his advanced age, still retains all power exclusively in his own hands and delegates no authority to any one - not even to the Crown Prince. Not only does he listen avidly to news collected from the radio broad casts of foreign stations but he takes a personal interest in the smallest item of news from any part of his own extensive territories* 6. Dr. Storm told me that Ibn Saud gave him Rs 1500 as a fee for the medical services he had rendered. Dr. Storm received also Rs 500 from the Amir Saud and about Rs 1000 from private patients. Sd/- E.

I could not find that tka he has anyone there. His agent in Bombay is Sbrahim Yousuf Zainal Alireza, Sitaram Buidling, D.Block, Fort, Bombay 1. If Ibn Saud wants something from Karachi, he orders his Bombay agent to arrange for its shipment, and the latter usually places such orders through Mohamed El-Marzook, Boree Road, Karachi. There is some other person named Yusuf al Majid at Karachi who is taking up the pilgrimage propaganda for the Indian at Karachi, He has not been appointed^y^the Saudi Government for this purpose, but he is doing it himself, and for it he gets some sort of commission^^i^^ 7 ^ i \ 1 w r iyTelegram From n «m i 61/11 Minister, Jedia.

His Majesty has decided upon India as being less likely to cause gossip and speculation than, Syria or any other Middle East country. 2. Ibn Saud has ashed me to arrange for above-mentioned to travel by air from Bahrain to India accompanied by eloebor and four servants (eight persons in all) and he asks that matter be treated as argent. 3. Can you arrange for BOAC to provide accomodation for this party in near future ? Alternatively I suggest Royal Air Force might like to provide transport in consideration for the many occasions on which their personnel have received help from Saudi Arabian authorities after forced landings in Saudi territory along Persian Gulf. Such a gesture v/ould certainly be very pleasin to Ibn baud and would be good propaganda for us in this country.

No. C/1028 Political Agency, Bahrain, the 31st July 1943. DO IjT) \o ? ! / In paragraph 133 (v) of my Intelligence Summary for the period 16th-30th June I reported the arrival at Bahrain of one of Xbn Saud^ younger sons, Abdul Mohsin. Abdul Mohsin is a boy of about 16 years of age, and came to Bahrain to be operated on for piles. The operation was successful, and Abdul Mohsin left Bahrain to return home on July 19th. Before he left His Highness Shaikh Salman sent a telegram to Ibn Saud informing him that Shaikh Abdullah al Fadhl was making arrangements for the boy^ journey. Ibn Saud ''sent a reply in Arabic of which a translation is enclosed. 2. On July 22nd His Highness received another telegram (translation endosed) from Ibn Saud. He was uncertain how this telegram was to be interpreted. He thought that pos sibly it was an indication that Ibn Saud wished to visit Bahrain; but he thought it more probable that Ibn Saud meant it as an invitation to him - Shaikh Salman - to visit Riyadh; ! and His Highness therefore asked my advice as to the reply which should be sent. 3. The Shaikh is not anxious for Ibn Saud to visit Bahrain at present. The simple truth is that he could not provide the food required to feed the King and his army of followers. Moreover, if Ibn Saud and his followers did pay a visit to Bahrain, the bazaars here would be cleared of such few articles as still remain for sale in them. On the other / y hand the Shaikh is somewhat attracted by the idea of visiting / r Riyadh /- Hon* ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.E., Political Resident in the \ Persian Gulf. Bushire. / V- 2 - ^0 *v !)■ Riyadh where he would, no doubt, be very well received. 4. I did not know what you would think about the propriety of Shafkh Salman visiting Riyadh, and I therefore temporised by pointing out to him that the King^ telegram r- did not contain a specific invitation, but was only in general terms expressing the hope that they would meet soon. And I suggested that a reply should be sent in terms equally general. In accordance with my suggestion the Shaikh sent 'a telegram on July 25th of which a translation is enclosed. 5. In spite of what I told the Shaikh I think the j underlying intention of the King* s second telegram is that he would like the Shaikh to pay him a visit. I shall be ' grateful for instructions, therefore, as to the line which should be taken if the Shaikh reverts to the subject, or if Ibn Saud writes or telegraphs again in more definite terms• Yours sincerely, ■ i/ A Translation of an Arabic telegram sent from Kuwait to Riyadh on 26th July 1943(seen in censorship) From - H.H.Shaikh Sir Ahmad al Jabir al Sabah.
