If so, would you be good enou^i to let me know by air nail what terns would be required and also if possible what preliminary information the expert would like to have before arriving; also whether he would wish any preliminary work to be done hei'e ready for the time when he does arrive.

During' this period my activities were concentrated on eliciting informa tion concerning the severity and distribution of malaria in the different parts of Bahrein lalands and on studying the correlation of the physiographlcnl and meteorological features with the incidence of the dise~se. While collec tions were made of a number of specimene of anopheline mosquitoes, a detailed inspection of all the potential breeding places was not undertaken. These speci iens re present the species which prevail in winter months and n*y or may not be the carrier species of malaria. It is clear that the solution of the problem of malaria in Bahrein will be forthcoming only after further invest! ations v/hich it is proposed to carry out during the malaria season. The investigations were confined to the main islands of Bahrein and Muharrak, and only such towns and villages were visited as were of sufficient political and economic Importance and, at the same time, displayed varying environ ments representative of other loctlities, A. Beneral DeijCrlutlQfl . iiahreln Island. The min Island of Bahrein, situated in latitude and longitude 50°61» 12, lies in a V-shaped Gulf of the Arabian coast. The mainland surrounds it on all three sides and lies roughly at a distance of 20 miles. The Island measures 30 miles in length. Its maxinsun breadth of 10 miles is attained in the northern section, the Island gradually narrowing to the south to terminate in a headland called lias-el-Bar. At a distance of about* three miles from the noi*thern coast, a great marine indenta tion called Khor-al-Kabb cuts into the island, penetrating from the east coast almost to its centre. The greater part of the island, especially the coastal strip, is a sandy, flat and low lying plain, but the surface gradually rises from all sides to form a bare stony plateau in the centre about 100-200 feet high. In the middle of the plateau is an oval-shaped depression which ie encircled by cliffs composed of Socene rocks of limestone with an ad mixture of gypsum and siliceous matter, in tae middle of the depression rises the only group of hills in the island. These are known as Jabl-al-Dukhan and attain a height of 440 feet. Cultivation is confined to a narrow belt of date palm plantations bordering the aforesaid marine indentation in the northern and north-eastern coast, which cover!- roughly 18-20 square mfles of the total area of 108 square miles of the island. These date groves are profusely watered from copious springs, which form a number of clear streams of warm and slightly brackish water. These springs are a k special feature of the island, and Lor^imex* (1915) considers that they are undoubtedly fed by the drainage of the high lands of Kajd in central Arabia, whence the water travels eastwards by subterranean passages. The localities examined on the island v/ere Manama town, Sukaiyah village, hifa-a-Ash Sharqi and Sakhir. Sfenama is the chief port of Bahrein island, and la situated on the coast at its north eastern corner. It extends 1* miles along the sea and lias a depth of about * mile inland. The buildings are for the greater part of masonry, but the habitations in the outskirts consist of mat huts with sloping roofs, standing in small courtyards surrounded by hurdles of upright date fronds. To the south of the town and in an open plain are situated Manama Fortand tne paiaco of His Higbnosa tlie aheikh, while ftu’ther south Immediately adjoining these and curving to the west of the town is a belt of dense palm cultivation. The population of the town is estimated at 40,000 to 50,000 and the subsoil water level is within a few feet of the surface. A number of seepage ponds exist, especially to the south west of the town, in the open plain between it and the Fort. .juitalvah is a small village consisting of scattered houses lying within the date palm groves. It is four miles south weit of Manama, and the general aspect of the village is similar in character to that met with in the villages situated Inside the cultivated coastal strip. Rifa-a^ ,sh Sharol is a large fortified village which overlooks the central depression at its north eastern corner. It occupies a dreary and barren site with no cultivation within 1-1 miles all round. The climate is, comparatively speaking, drier than in the rest of the island and the vill age is treated as a natural sanitarium of Bahrein islands. Beneath the cliff and close to the village at a distance of 4 mile are two wells called the H&amp;nani wells, one of which yields clear sweet v/ater in j^eat demand throughout the island, while the other is not in use and contains a collection of polluted water. consists of a number of Isolated buildings occupied by the Sheikh and his relatives. It lies within the central depression about a mile north west of jabl-al- Dukhan. There is no vegetation or cultivation within li miles of this site, and the only apnarent sources of mosqui- toux breeding apart from domestic collections of water consist of three wells in the immediate neighbourhood. hiuharrak Island. This is situated to the north east of the main island of Bahrein and is separated from it by a shallow strait.*•! 4 t- H rnilss In a«ecntly a oauo^my hia boon litrot-'n acroais the greater part of this etrait, but land eonrunlori- tlon between the two islands bos not yet been antabll&amp;Md, ac a iirmill gup etill Intervenes. s uh&amp;rrak island is Indented on Its south western eo#e by two deep inlets which greatly reduce its square area* it presents a sandy bare prospect and on account of the lack of water, date plantations occur in Isolated olrcunouribed patch* ea in places Where well Irrigation is possible.

The water supply is from a nunfoer of artesian wells inside the town, supplemented by a spring in a date palm grove called Zirama about £ mile to the north. The peculation is estimated at 8,000, in addition the to Zimma palm grove,/islet of Abushahir, situated one mile south east of the town, contains a large plantation. An artesian well about 400 yards north of Zimma irrigates the onlj other patch of palm trees in the neighbourhood of this town. dal all is a village on the north eastern coast of Muhsrrak island, inhabited almost entirely by a small pearl fishing coRKiunity. Up to 1930 or so the nearest plantation was in Ain Mohd bin Oalim, about half a mile away, but another grove Irrigated by an artesian well has recently been planted about i mile went of village. Inside the village itself two artesian 'wells wore sunk in 1929, and their effect on malaria incidence is discussed In a later section, (page 14). Climate and haasona. Bahrein lies outside the zone of the S.W. monsoon and the seasons are said to be characteristic of a temperate zone, viz,, a rainless summer and a wet winter. The cil’natic condi tions are, however, by no means temperate', and the only favourable remark that can be made for the climate of Bahrein is that it is somewhat better than that of Masqat, one of the hottest places in the world. The prevailing wind popularly known as Shamal blows from the north west, and during the winter months it alternates with a south-easterly wind. Shamal blows more steadily during the jnonths of May, June and July, when it is locally known as Barih, The coninon belief is that the failure of Barih results in failure of rain in the ensuing winter, and according to LorVimar some recorded instances corroborate this theory. The meteorological records for Manama are available from October 1901. They show that the temperature ranges betweenthe recorded rauxi-um of 107.5°F and a minimum of 40°F. Roughly, the weather from Octoher to April inclusive is pleasant; May and June are hot months, hut the heat is still tempered by Barih which may vary and thus affect the tempera ture prevailing in these months. From the middle of June till the end of Ueptemoer the heat is oppressive with occasional breezes, the temperature remaining permanently above 100°F. ^ The fortnightly averages of temperature and relative bio U-i humidity for the years iyii2-1937 are given in Table I. The average rainfall is inches a year, but the relative humidity of the atmosphere is constantly high owing to the proximity of the sea, the average being 79-80&gt;. The rain is strictly confined to the winter months and it all falls in the course of a few days, the average number of rainy days being 3 to 6 each year. . ooulutlon and Industry. As no census has been taken, only approximate estirates of the population can be given. Up to the last decade the total population of the entire Archipelago was reckoned at 100,000, but recently there bias been a considerable increase and it is now estimated at approximately 150,000. The prosperity of the island, apart from the date plantations and trade as a ’’clearing house” for the mainland tol- Arabia, depended up to 1931 almost entirely on the pearl ^ fisheries which are conducted in the neighbouring; waters. The pearling season lasts roughly from the middle of May till the middle of October. The preparations for the operations, how ever, commence in April, when a considerable Influx of divers from the surrounding coastal and inland towns occurs and pearl merchants arrive from all over the world. This produces a large floating population in Bahrein during these months. Recently, owing to the discovery of oil fields in the islands a further immigration of Americans and Europeans together with Indian and Iraqi labour has occurred.7 particularly since mi. The penrtuient population of Bahrein includes a vui'iety of races. Of these, the most numerous race or at class is composed of Baharinas whose exact origin is still in doubt, being considered by some authorities ae an aboriginal race and by others as descendants of an early ^rab tribe. H#xt in numbers are the ruling Arab tribes, who have resided in the islands for over two centuries. Thirdly, a large number of Iranian families have settled on this island at various j periods, and these have now become part and parcel of the general population. Fourthly, negroes and half castes pro vide a fairly large element. Finally a heterogeneous group is composed of Iraqis, Jews, Europeans and Americans. B. Prevalence of I.aluri^. No records of any previous malaria surveys are available, but local medical opinion is inclined to the view that the disease has increased considerably during the past decade, fthile this may have been the case, the assertion that tuere was little or no malaria in the island until recently is not borne out by reference to literature. In fact. It would appear that the disease had been a recognised scourge from . remote times. Thus Belgrave (1935) describes the almost complete annihilation of a Portuguese contingent of 400 men by an '’epidemic of fever” when they invested Manama Fort in late September 1529, and mentions that the Portuguese and Horrauzlan units of the force were equally affected. The statement that 'when only thirty five lout of 4ou men) remained fit for duty they decided to withdraw” indicates the severity of the epidemic. That the disease was probably malaria can be deduced from the absence of mortality and the season of its incidence. Wilson (1928) quotes Qudama, who wrote in the ninth century A.D. that the climate of Bahrein 'induces congestion of the liver”, probably malarial. LorRmer 11915) states that malaria fever is the principalx^JUJU —j 8 j “ -V of the Persian Oulf, and that cold weather is more unhealthy than the hot, although in some places sickness is more prevalent at transitional monthr. Finally Harrison (1924) after 12 years of hospital practice in Manama, refers to the place as 'full of fever' and adds that 'all along the coast (Arabian) the efficiency of the population is reduced by malaria to a mere fraction of what it ought to be'. From the foregoing it is permissible to conclude that r-\ the disease has prevailed in the islands from remote times, and the problem to be considered is whether any recent increase in severity has occurred or not. The amount of malaria in a locality is assessed from la) Vital statistics. ,b) Hospital attendance records. ,c) Snleen rate (percentage of children with enlarged spleens). (d) Parasite index, (oercentage of children with malaria parasites in their blood). (a) Vita Av^nviffs. There ore none available for Bahrein islands. (b) uamital xsp.Qrifi. The number of malaria cases and the number of cases from all causes treated at Victoria Memorial Hospital, Manama, for butcU, 1920-1937 are given in Table II. In the analysis of these figures there are two factors which must be considered, in the first place, the variation in total population is not known. Secondly, the Increase in the popularity of the Western system of medicine would tend to produce an apparent increase in the number of attendances. The available figures, therefore, do not necessarily signify an acutal increased incidence, nor are they always comparable from year to year. But a reference to Table II will show that the total number of cases from all causes who received treatment at the hospital during the years 1933-37 varied within narrow limits, and consequently the malaria incidence range for these yearsfigures of attendances fox* malaria during these years (iVoo- 13^7). The fortnightly mean temperatures are also indicated In Chart I, from which It will be seen that the season of Incidence of malaria coincides with the period during which the mean temperature ranges continuously between 7D°F. and 90°F. This occurs in two distinct periods, the first of which begins about the end of April and lasts till the first _ week of July, while the second comprises the months of October and November. It will also be seen that the length of the period in which the temperature prevails within this range influences the degree of malaria occurring during that season, and with the exception of the year 1937 malaria prevailed more markedly during April and Kay than in the autumn months. The prevalence of the disease, however, does not show the same degree of correlation with humidity and rainfall as in Northern India, the reason being that in these islands the humidity Is favourable for the life of mosquito throughout the year, and the determining factor for the incidence of the disease is the temperature. In Northern India, on the other hand, favourable humidity prevails only during a limited period during and after the monsoon. These figures are, however, being subjected to further analysis ann will be alluded to again in the final report. (c) Kolaon rates. In order to determine reliable spleen rates for each 1 cality, it was considered that religious schools would be more suitable, as they were attended by children between 4-14 years of ages from houses in the iunodiate neighbourhood. Table IV shows the results of these examinations. yy 0ra Table IV it will be seen that the occurrence of enlarged spleens is not uniform. Thus, in Manama town where it was possible to conduct the examination of a sufficient number of children in the different parts of the town, the maximum number of enlarged spleens was encountered in the10 Fort area sad Inotbe sdjolnlac. ’wain* areu. In the Municipal garden area which occupies a more central position the spleen rate was below 10/J, but the fitwos for JOria MaeJid and Market Area j*ow that even in the centre of the town, toe rates Increase in the northern section. Finally Kura which is situated in the south-eastern portion of the town is highly malarious. An interesting feature is the prevalence of high figures for average enlarged spleen in all localities except Jama Masjid area. Indicating that in the latter area a new factor has been introduced recently. With regard to the spleen rate in Muharrak town, it was found that the figures for the entire population were much lower than those for Manama. Owing to the congested and com pact nature of the town it was not possible to divide it into many sections, but a rough sub-division into noi'thern and southern halves showed that the latter contained a larger proportion of enlarged spleens. The spleen rates in Hidd indicate a malaria Incidence of moderate intensity midway between Manama and Muharrak, while those in Galali village on the eastern coast of Muharrak island point to a moderate endemic condition. In Sukaiya, iilfsua-Ash-c)har&lt;ii and Sakhir, only a small number of children could be examined, and the results show that in the first two places a high to moderate degree of malaria prevailed, while in the last named the incidence of disease was mild in character. With regard to the prevalence of enlarged spleen in different races, the spleen rates among all the Arab, Baharlna and Iranian children examined In the Islands are shown in Table V. uoni-aaita . Arabs. Baharinas, Iranians. 103 65 34 29 ■Inleen rate 23.8/i 33.05s, 44.6^laUr From Tibia V It will be seen that the i»rab children among whom are included the negroes and the half castes, showed the least number of enlarged spleens. As regards Buharinas and Iranians a higher spleen rate among the former is probably due to the location of their settlements in or near the gardens, while the high figures among the latter may indicate a higher racial susceptibility. (d) While the number of children who submitted to splenic examination was, in most places, sufficient, much difficulty was encountered in obtaining their blood smears, as a consequence, the parasite index has been determined for each locality on a smaller number of examinations, as shown in Table VI. The figures in Table VI confirm the findings discussed in the preceding section under spleen rate. In the central • parts of Manama Town (Municipal Gardens, Jama Kasjid areas), the parasite rate is in excess of the spleen rate. This signifies that while transmission of malaria of fairly high degree was taking place it had not resulted in concurrent increase of splenic enlargement. Considering that treatment was available equally in all parts of the twra, it may be inferred that the causative factors were either the produc tion of fresh breeding places ouch as artesian wells or the introduction of new strains of the malarial parasite by the recent immigration or a combination of those two factors. Naim ares and the Fort, on the other hand, are typically severely infected sections representing a more constant and static form of malarial incidence. The remaining localities call for no special comment, except that Hidd shows a comparatively high parasite rate, and here the role of artesian wells will have to be carefully elucidated. As regards the species of parasites, the abnormallylarge proportion of quartan infections is noteworthy. C. Aimniiellne Breedln:; Places. Detailed inveutigatlons into the breeding of anopheline raosquitces will he carried out later in the year, and in this report it is proposed to describe the potential breeding grounds and to indicate their epidemiological significance. (1) Date Palm Gi’oves. Date-palm plantations, which are almost the only agri cultural product of the island, are of three varieties. Haiti- al-Saih are those plantations which are watered from flowing streams by gravitation; xlakhl-al-Dua'o are irrigated by means of skins raised by camels or donkeys walking down a slope; and Hakhl-al-Ghurafa in which the water is raised from pits by means of wooden beam worked by man with the help of counterpoise. A fourth method of irrigation from artesian wells has been increasingly brou&lt;£it into use since 192B especially along the coastal strip. From the malaria viewpoint iiakhl-al-Duab and liakhl-al- Ghurafa present identical problems, and the different methods utilised for lifting the water do not affect the mosquito production. In such gardens the chief, if not the only, source of breeding for mosquitoes is provided by the unfilled disused wells. Por, in the greater part of the plantation area 'it suffices to dig the ground with the Viand and water is found', but this water turns brackish after a varying period and a new excavation is made in the vicinity. The problem thus bears a strong resemblance to that of the casualna pits in Bnnore near Madras. On the other hand Hakh-al-Saih is productive of more extensive breeding grounds, as also are those gardens which are irrigated by artesian wells. In the newly planted state the gardena are well terraced and the water In the irrigation channels after running alongside the trees is directed into• .j41- jl . i- . •&gt;• i i f ■ &lt;? i'* * i*.y ' »■'. f-j/• ‘ ' ‘ * : f * y • u ■ • i t [i i .v J . ■. ~ j A f | .■ ,v / : A/ I s i *1, rC; &gt;\ — • aAlaj^e teeni eoiia-iX^'ii tc * S'' 1 V?

In other places the ground being flat with little or no fall, the spring possesses insufficient head for Irrigation purposes and deep Irrigation channels are necessary. The gardens irrigated by flowing water are almost invariably water-logged, and contain numerous excavations Into which seepage water accumulates, and this is utilised for household purposes. When this water turns brackish after varying periods now excavations are made, without filling the old ones where anopheline breeding was encountered. Finally the springs and large water courses provide a fruitful source of mosquito production, the larvae from which drift continual^ into the gardens. (ii) aortic gaargsg. Under this heading are included: (a) wells, (b) artesian wells, (c) water jars, (d) cesspits, (e) borrow-pits, and (f) reclamation pits. (a) ..elif’ . Those exist extensively in private houses in Manama and Muharrak towns and are utilised for washing and bathing. They were the only sources of water for this purpose prior to 1925, when artesian wells were first brought into use* The wells, however, have not been filled in and the nature of mosquito breeding in them will be taken up at the next visit to the islands, (b) Artesian wells . The first artesian well was sunk in Manama in March 1925, and at Muhasrralt in Hovember of the same year. Since then theso wells have multiplied considerably and at present about 19 exist in Manama and Muharrak towns respectively and a smaller number in all coastal towns and villages.The most important aspect of artesian wells from the malaria point of vlev; is the adequacy or otherwise of a nrovision for the disposal of surplus water. The role of artesian wells in the causation of malaria will be more fully dealt with in the final report, hut it is quite evident even at this stare that they are frequently associated with a high degree of malaria if the drainage of surplus water is not satisfactory. Thus, in Hubarrak, where with one exception the artesian wells are situated along the coast, the water being conducted through short drainage channels direct into fife the sea, only a low degree of malaria prevails as is reflected in the spleen rates. On the other hand, the case of Oalali is an outstanding example of the harmful effects of artesian |i wells, in this village two artesian wells were sunk in March and July 1929, and in April and May 1930 malaria broke out in an epidemic form, involving a high incidence of mortality. ^ One of the wells, situated in the centre of the village, dis charged into a large cement tank, the outflow from which v/as utilised for the irrigation of a plantation on low-lying ground close to the village. Information obtained from local enquiries was to the effect that this well produced a considerable number of pools in the inrnediate neighbourhood of the tank and in and around the plantation. Visual impres sions also showed that the site of the nrevious garden was situated at such low level that drainage could not have been possible. Tbe other well v/as sunk close to the coast and the water after collection into a tank led off direct into jl * 1 the sea. After the epidemic of April-May 1930, the former well was closed, and the garden was uprooted in December | 1930. Since then, although a moderate degree of unexplained malaria still prevails, the local population is definitely of the opinion that the severity and toe extent of the disease have decreased considerably, (c) Water iars . owing to the scarcity of water thesejarc are neceaaury for its storage. The jars are pyramidal In shape with a narrow bottom, which is not easy to clean, and frequently containe a deposit of greenish slime. Inspec tion of a email number of jars chows! full grown larvae of cullcine mosquitoes but no aaophelin* larvae were encountered. (d) jesapit:. . This is the usual method of disposal of night-soil in towns. In masonry buildings the pipe leading down to the cesspits ensures a closed and protected system, hut in poorer habitations a small hole about 0' in diameter leads directly into the pit, which receives not only the night-soil but also domestic washings. While they would presumably he a fruitful source of culicine mosquitoes, it ie doubtful wnether they would contribute to the anopheline production to any appreciable extent. (•) ;; or row-nits . Owing to the lack of rain, the accurra- lation of water in sorrow-pits is of negligible importance. If, however, tne borrow-pita are situated in the neighbourhood of a spring or watercourse, seepage and overflow results in a perennial collection of water. The Sorrow-pits to the north of the lunatic asylum in Kansas furnish an example of the latter type, and here a fairly intensive degree of anopheline breeding was found to occur. (f) neclamatlon nits . Reclamation pits exist mostly in the coastal portion of Manama end Muliarrak towns. The water is highly brachish and is connected with the sea, as is shown by the fact that tho level of water in the pits rises and falls with the tide. They showed no breeding even after frequent inspection. (ill) nusoios of nflopaeiin^ ;n.y&gt;d survey. The following is the list of species collected:- I- H&amp;tgWfcs 2.

The conclusions arrived at were that the humidity in the island17 being consiatently favourable tliroughout the yeiir, variations $ in the length of period during which mean temperature remain ed constantly between 75°F. and 90°?. determine the severity of the malaria season. With regard to the distribution of malaria, the spleen rates in Manama town, Sukaiya and Muharrak town would indic ate that the causation of malaria was intiraately related to the presence or otherwise of gardens in the i-?nediate neighbourhood. But it is equally evident that gardens are not the sole factor, and that a high degree of malaria may prevail in their absence, for example in liifa-a-Ash-Sharqi and the Market and the Jama Masjid areas in Manama Town. The nature of the influences at work in these latter areas V will probably provide an important clue to the malaria problf of the island. The case of Galali is in certain respects peculiar, as the history of malaria in this village does not altogether furnish the reasons for the existing moderate endemicity. | A solution of these problems will be forthcoming only after a detailed anopheline survey, for which the foilowing programme is proposed:- (a) The determination of the vector species. (b) The bionomics of tne vector species. (c) The relative intensity of breeding in:- and ,i) the gardens, ,11) the artesian wells and drains, ,ili) wells, pits and excavations, ,iv) vrater storage jars. (d) The feasibility of the employment of cheap sluicing methods and of larvivorous finh such as gambusla afflnls in the control of breeding. The following staff is suggested for these inveetiga. tions:- (1) Medical officer - To initiate the investigations, probable period of stay - one week. (2) One Sub-Assistant Surgeon^, (3) One Lab. Assistant ) To carry out investigation! (4) One Insect Collector ) over a perioa of six weeksrS /A 18 .a l 1 It is clear that a complete program* of malaria control can only he outlined after the completion of the anopheline mosquito survey, hut certain measures are so urgent and necessary that they may be Indicated in this report. Thus It has already been pointed out that artesian wells, unless provided with efficient drainage for surplus v/ater, are, on epidemiologlcai grounds, a fruitful source of malaria, it Is recomnended, therefore, that sanction be withheld from sinking any more artesian wells until their effect has been thoroughly investigated, and a suitable type of an artesian well evolved. Secondly, owing to the isolated nature of the police lines in the Fort, It Is considered that malaria in this locality would be amenable to control by the use of insectici dal sprays during next malaria season viz., middle of March to middle of June, This method is strongly reconwended and its details are given In the Appendix. aslsmseg; Lorimer, J,&lt;3.

Kerosene oil (superior quality) 19 parts. The requirements of Pyrocide 20, obtainable from F.S. Kerr &amp; Co., Port, Bombay, © about ils.32/- per gallon, is estimated at apnroxlmately 3 gallons for the se*ison.

The entire area should be divided into two approximately equal sections each of Which should be sprayed on alternate days with Friday as a non-working day. Doors, windows and other openings should be closed and covered with cloth curtains, if possible, and the room sprayed for five minutes with the help of a flit gun. The spray should, thereafter, he allowed to act for 20 minutes before the room is opened up. In the case of open sheds an endeavour should be made to secure direct hits especially of the mosquitoes resting on rafters and ceiling thatch. An average room (1500 c.ft.) requires fr oz. of diluted spraying solution. The staff should work in pairs, one of whom does the actual spraying while the other carries Duray- ing solution for refill and assiets in closing the room etc. With two such units an average of 30 rooms can be dealt with in an hour provided a good routine has been evolved. It is essential for the success of the campaign that all rooms whether occupied or not should be sprayed and particular attention should be paid to the prisoners’ cells, the Engineer’s bungalow and the huts in the waqf garden south of the Fort.

I had a wonderful time there and thanks to you I shall always carry very pleasant memories of Bahrain. The interim report from Majid, my assistant, shows that the investigations are progressing quite satisfactorily. So far the water jars have not Been found to he the source of anophellne breeding. This is extremely lucky and I hope, therefore, to he able to sketch out a programme for doing something in Bahrain. Before I left I talked to Steel on the tele phone regarding the possibility of vertical drainage and he promised to consider that- point. In special localities that might be our only solution. I am having a very busy time trying to clear off the arrears but I fear that before I get through one lot something else turns up. That, I suppose, happens to every one of us and it is no use grumbling. H. Welghtman, Esq H. Welghtman, Esq., I.C.S Bahrain Agency, Manama,NO.F.560-N/37.

With reference to the correspondence ending with the D.G., I.M.S., U.O.No.901/37-H., dated the 6th May, 1938, on the above subject, I am directed to Inform Government that Major Afridl and subordinate staff have completed malaria investigations in Bahrein. Major Afridl has submitted his report, a copy of which I have the honour to forward here with for favour of transmission to the Bahrein Government through the External Affairs Department. 2. nils Is a very complete and useful report which concludes with a series of recommendations for the preven tion of mosquito breeding and the consequent reduction of malaria. These recommendations are clear cut and well defined. It is now for the local authorities to consider them in detail and take measures to carry them out. Some are simple, others are more comprehensive and expensive but, if malaria is to be kept under control, there can be no question of adopting the first and neglecting the latter. 3. The question of training a medical officer in anti malaria work would seem to be the first requirement. Per haps the authorities would wish to have an officer trained in the Malaria Class held annually by the Malaria Institute of India, if so, application should be made for the reservation of a place in the class without avoidable delay.3 OBJECT VU. ’ ,r No. F. 470-N/38, Tiie Under Secretary to the Orovernment of India in the IScternal ;\ffaira Depart^aetni, The Hobble the 1‘olitical Resident in the Persian Gulf.
