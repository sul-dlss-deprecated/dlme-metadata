Political Agency, Bahrain, The 29th November, 1944. My dear Sir Geoffrey, Please refer to the enclosure to your endorsement No,D 0»®/526 dated the 23rd November. 2. As Commodore Howson rightly states I was most surprised that the Navy would not assist me on the occasion referred to. Some British sailors had landed in contravention of Shillington 1 s own instructions to masters and of King^ Regulation No.2 of 1937, paragraph 1, and the agents for the ship had informed me that the men had refused to return to their vessel and had disappeared into the town with the apparent intention of breaking the monotony of their voyage with spirituous and such other comforts as they could find. It was towards the end of Ramadhan^ and as you well know tempers are rather strained at that time^so I was particularly anxious to avoid any incident between these men and the local population. I did not wish to involve the Bahrain police with British seamen and considered that as the men followed the profession of the sea the Naval Officer-in-charge would be the most appropriate person to ask for assistance. I did so and was met with the usual lack of co-operation, which I have been led to expect, being told that merchant seamen ashore were no business whatsoever of his ; that he had no intention of rendering any assistance^and would certainly not send anyone to advise the men to return to their ship. How ever he did volunteer to inform the master of the ship to which the men belonged that the men were ashore. I did not ask Shlllington to arrest the seamen but to send one or two men to the town to endeavour to persuade the men to return to their ship without creating any dis turbance. I then turned to Hewitt, the Station Commander, and found him as helpful as usual. In spite of the fact that hehad only three out of his five policeaen f who were then here solely for Refinery security dutyi fit for duty and that it was certainly not their business to deal with disorderly seamen, he lamediately issued instructions for two of his men to go to the Agents 1 office in Manama and remain there in order to co-operate with the local police should it become necessary. I have always found the Army ready and willing to give me every possible assistance even if it may have meant that they were undertaking tasks which were strictly not within their province. It is interesting to note that at that time Hewitt had a maximum strength of five men as opposed to Shillington's fifty. 3. With regard to Shillington's statement that he had made repeated requests to me and the Bahrain Government for written orders to the effect that seamen should not come ashore. X havo received no request in writing nor to the best of my knowledge and belief verbally from Shillington but I did pointwt out to him at a meeting, when I and not the Bahrain Government requested him to include in his orders to visiting, ships instructions regarding merchant seamen coming ashore, that all merchant seamen were forbidden from landing under Clause 1 of King's Regulation No.2 of 1937. Perhaps the Senior Naval Officer would care to let me have a copy of any one of Shillington's alleged requests for written inst ructions. King's Regulation No.2 of 1937 has as the name implies been In force for the last seven years and I am sur prised that the office of the Naval Officer-in-charge Bahrain had no knowledge of this very important document. 4 # I shall be glad if a copy of this letter could be sent to Commodore Howson for I would not have him think that I had made the remark to which he objected without, what I hope</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0002cf_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/1112</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0002cf</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/1112</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 3/26 Shore landing: permission to land on shore to the crew and troops.'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1943/1944</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-10-14T11:35:43</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (9 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged chronologically from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliaton: the foliation system in use is the sequence of numbers in pencil in the top right hand corner of each page.
