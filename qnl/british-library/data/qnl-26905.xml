Sir, With reference to my telegram No.278 of October 22nd, I have the honour to transmit to you, herewith, a translation of the note that I have received from the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject of the activities of a Persian customs launch in Muscat territorial waters near Khassab on or about June 12th last. 2. You will observe that the reply is a denial in toto and no attempt is made to raise any of the points of principle which the alleged action of the customs launch involved (see, for examole, your despatch No.394 of September 26th, B 5609/114/34). 3. It is true that there was some uncertainty as to the identity of the customs launch, but it seems unlikely that the Wall of Khassab would have fabricated the entire story. 4. if further evidence regarding the launch's identity and movements can be secured, I suggest that I should communicate it to the Persian Government and ask for further investigations to be made. My note would have to add that I the question of representations on behalf of Arab rulers had been, or would be, treated separately. 5. I have ascertained that in the original Persian text the term 'Sheikh” of Muscat, instead of Sultan of Muscat, is The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., etc., etc., etc..

From the detailed information received on the subject it appears that the report received by His Britannic Majesty's Legation in Tehran is untrue as at the date mentioned (in your note) none of the ships of the Imperial Navy have been within the limits of Muscat and that motor-launch No.6 which is at the disposal of the Customs was on that date stationed at Bandar Abbas and has not left there. 3.

The likelihood of their taking action under the proclamation would be increased by the act of cancellation, which would draw their attention to an instrument the existence of which they have otherwise probably forgotten. 2 # I also agree that the notification should be ex post facto .

The Wall of Khasah informed K)WEY on 14th June that after dark on 12th June a small Persian Armed Launch (possibly 'PAHLEVT') steamed past Khasab and was at anchor next morning near Hanah with a Persian motor dhow and a captured Persian dhow. It appears, also, that for two days previous to this incident Khor Kawi had been used as its base for anti-smuggling aotivities.

It will be remembered that on 12th June last, an armed Persian launch visited Khassab, in 'Oman waters. I gather that the Council of Ministers at Muscat believed that the Persian Government had been informed that a notificatiorybf visit was required in the event of a visit by Persian warships, and it would seem that other Arab rulers are of the same opinion. As a result of enquiries, there seems to be some uncertainty as to whether the Persian Government has actually been informed or not. The Hon.the Political Resident (Colonel Fowle), who was about to proceed on leave, told me he would raise the question with the Foreign Office once more when he was in London.In any further communication on this subject, please quote No and address “The Under-Secretary Foreign Office, Reference to previous correspondence : Name and Date. %Pt r f, »- £ £6-0 f //ftf/Si- (? —not to any person by name, but to-y • || iry of State,” Foreign Ofllce, London, S.W. 1.

I approve the terms of your note No. 403 of the 3rd August to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs on this subject. 3. The general attitude of His Majesty’s Government on the question of the right of innocent passage through territorial waters is set forth in their reply to a questionnaire circulated in connexion with the draft ’’Articles Concerning the Legal Status of the Territorial Sea drawn up at the Hague Conference of 1930. Copies of the relevant passages of the questionnaire, and of the replies of His Majesty’s Government thereto, are enclosed herein for your information. 4. I am advised that at present there exists in the Persian Gulf no special usage in this matter, and it is indeed important that no action should be taken which might weaken, as far as the Gulf is concerned, the principle of the right of innocent passage through territorial waters, since, as you are aware, a part of the Rooka Channel, which gives access to the Shatt el-Arab, must probably be regarded as Persian. 5.

For the same reason, it is desirable that no protest should he made to the Persian Government against the mere passage of Persian warships or preventive craft, even when escorting other Persian vessels under arrest, through the territorial waters of the Arab rulers of the Persian Gulf, although on a strict interpretation of the legal position such a practice might perhaps be regarded as open to objection in that it involves the exercise of a sovereign right within the jurisdiction of a foreign Power. I consider, however, that no undesirable precedent will have been established by your protest, in the present case, against the use of Muscat! waters by Persian launches as a base of operations for the capture of the dhow, and against the fact that the captured vessel was kept under arrest in Muscat! waters, i.e. remained at anchor there for a considerable time. 6. With regard to paragraph 5 of the India Office letter of the 30th August, I shall be glad to learn your views on the desirability of notifying the Persian Government formally on behalf of the Sultan of Muscat if it should later be decided to cancel or modify the Muscat Proclamation of 1898.

Monsieur le Ministre, I have the honour to inform Your Highness that I have received a report to the effect that on June 12th (Khordad 22nd) last, an armed Persian launch, accompanied by an auxiliary customs service dhow, and another Persian dhow that the launch had recently captured, anchored for two days in the roadstead of Khassab, a Muscat port on the Musandim peninsular. 2* i*he captain’s name, so far as the u-overnor ox Khassab could ascertain, was Abdulla bin Muhammad, or perhaps Abdulla 'Pashmi', and that of a military officer on board Ahmad Sheikh. The number of the launch was believed to be No.5, but this may have been a mistake for No.6. 3. It also appears that the launch had spent the two previous days in Khor Kawi, off the Musandim ueninsula, in Muscat territorial waters, and had used these waters as a base from which to capture the dhow. 4. On behalf of His Highness, the Sultan of Muscat, I desire to enter an emphatic protest against the action of this armed launch in using Muscat waters as a base for ; operations, in visiting a Muscat port without prior 1 notification, and in keeping a captured dhow under arrest ^ in Muscat territorial waters, even though the dhow was a Persian one. 5. His Highness Mirza Mohamed Ali Khan Feroughi, Minister for Foreign Affairs.5. I have the honour to request that Your Highness will hring t-he facts to the notice of the competent authorities and will call for the explanations that the serious nature of these facts demands. 6. I understand that during the period in question the weather was uniformly fine and that the Persian vessels did not provision or water at Khassab, so that the encroachment can evidently not have taken place on the grounds of stress of weather or lack of food or water.

It is desirable that no protest should be made to the Persian Government against the mere passage of Persian warships or preventive craft, even when escorting other Persian vessel© under arrest, throughthrough the territorial waters of the Arab rulers of the Persian Gulf, although on a strict interpretation of the legal position such a practice might perhaps be regarded as open to objection in that it involves the exercise of a sovereign right within the jurisdiction of a foreign Power* I consider, however, that no undesirable precedent will have been established by your protest, in the present case, against the use of Muscat! waters by Persian launches as a base of operations for the capture of the dhow, and against the fact that the captured vessel was kept under arrest in Muscatl waters, i.e* remained at anchor there for a considerable time. 5. ,ith regard to paragraoh 5 of the India Office letter of the 30th August, I should be glad to learn your views on the desirability of notifying the eraian Government formally on behalf of the jultan of tfuacat if it should later be decided to cancel or modify the Muscat Proclamation of 1898■mim xx, Innocent of Foreign &gt;hlp» through Territorial wetcre.

States are entitled to regulate the passage of foreign warships through their territorial waters and the anchoring of such warships therein. A copy of the Admiralty memorandum containing the regulations to which foreign warships entering the territorial waters or ports of Great Britain and Northern Ireland are expected to conform is annexed. If a foreign warship fails to comply with the regulations Issued by the authorities of the $tate whose ports or waters she enters, the attention of her commanding officer should be called to the fact of such non-compliance. If failure is persisted in, the foreign warship may be required to depart.Register No. ?zir 'll ' SECRET. POLITICAL DEPARTMENT. Dated Ree. Formally acknowledged 19 Date. Initials. SUBJECT.

That submission was withdrawn consequent on information from the foreign Office that their Legal Advisers, for the reasons stated in Mr. Warner’s letter of 15th August on P.Z. 5004/33, felt doubtful as to whether we could in fact protest to the Persian Government against an infringement of Muscat territorial waters (as distinct from a visit without notification to Muscat ports) and that, pending closer examination of the position Mr. Mallet had been instructed to suspend action on bushire despatch of 3rd July until he.should receive further instructions. 2. It subsequently appeared that Mr. Mallet had already made representations on the general lines set out in his telegram of 8th August, No. 166, at P.Z. 4885/33, (flagged). The action taken by the Charge d’Affaires is all to the good, whatever the precise position as regards territorial waters. 3. Reference is now invited to the Foreign Office letter of 15th August on P.Z. 5044/33, and the Admiralty letter undated but received on 21st August, on P.Z.5161/33. 4. In the light of the correspondence we need, I think, feel no difficulty in agreeing to approve the action taken by Mr. Mallet. As regards territorial waters, it seems clear from the Admiralty letter that there is no established, special usage in the Gulf at variance with the general right of innocent passage for warships through foreign territorial waters and, on general grounds, it is on the whole undesirable to encourage Muscat or the other Sheikhdoms to establish such a usage. The effect of this will, of course, be that Persian war vessels will have a right of innocent passage through the waters of the/ 1712n 5000 3/33the Sheikhdoms, but despite the disadvantages involved there seems, in view of the position adopted internationally by H. T \Gr. and of the special difficulties in the Shatt-el-Arab to which the Admiralty refer in their letter on P.Z* 5161/33, nothing for it but to acquiesce in this, authorising the Resident to make the position clear to the Local Rulers when a convenient opportunity arises, and to advise them to keep a sharp lookout for any extension by Persian warships of such rights of innocent passage. 5. As regards the Muscat Proclamations of 1898 and 1903, copies of which are now art-teehed, there is, I suggest, no need to take any action on the Proclsmatibn of 1903 which affects H.M.Q. and Italy only. As regards the Proclamation of 1898, subject to any views which the Resident might express, there seems no reason to anticipate any difficulty in securing its cancellation or modification by the Sultan of Muscat. On the other hand there is a good deal to be said for waiting until we have more positive evidence (such as may be afforded by the Persian reply to Mr. Mallet T s protest in the present case) that the Persians have not forgotten its existence. Apart from this, if and when the Proclamation is cancelled or modified in so far as it affects Persia, one cannot help feeling that both on general grounds and in the interests of depriving Persi of the excuse that action in some specific case had beeji taken by her Navy under the impression that the Proclamation still held good, the cancellation or be modification ought to/ either by a notification officially published in Muscat, or consequent on a communication made by us on behalf of the Muscat State to the Persian Government.

We agree in the first place with the view of the F,0. as regards the protest put in by Mallet. 3. As regards the Muscat Proclamations I enclose for convenience of reference copy of the notes exchanged with the Persian Government in 1897, of the Muscat Proclamation of 1898, and of the difficulty need be anticipated in securing its cancellation or modification by the Sultan of Muscat should we desire this. (In this Copy to COPY SENT TO ENCLOSURE IN W^FKIY LETTER tsO. 3 5 1 (Mr. Seal) 33 31 Alia 1935 AND Muscat Notification of 1903. I do not think that we need concern ourselves with the Notification of 1903, which affects H.M.G, and that only. 4. As regards the Proclamation of 1898, I gathered from our conversations with Fowle that no SECi&gt;u 1 I _ r; . ? \ I connection/connection we, of course, agree with the Admiralty that there could be no question of the removal of the powers at present exercised by H.M.G, under that Proclamation, but I do not imagine that any difficulty with the Sultan would arise on this point, which could most simply be met its+xA- by the enactment of a fresh Proclamation.) As regards the expediency of immediate action, the India Office have in the past been inclined to think that the Persians have probably forgotten the existence of this Proclamation, and that we should do best to suspend action for its cancellation until we had some definite evidence that this was not the case; and on the whole we should I think be disposed even now to leave matters as they are for the moment. If either in reply to Mallet’s note, or in any other connection, the Persians show signs of realising the existence of the Proclamation, we shall have cleared the ground by the present discussion and can take action without delay. 5 . If and when it does come to a question of cancelling or we modifying the Proclamation/kre disposed to think, unless the F.O. see objection, that both on general grounds and in the interest of arising/Department. depriving Persia of the excuse that action in some specific instance had been taken by her Navy under the impression that the Proclamation still held good, it would be desirable formally to notify Persia on behalf of the Sultan, perhaps preferably ex cost facto . 6 . We note that in the view of the Admiralty there is no established special usage in the Persian Gulf at variance with the right of innocent passage of foreign warships through territorial waters. The arguments put forward by the Admiralty against advising the local rulers to establish such a special usage are strong, and we do not desire to oppose them, though it would be unwise to overlook the risk that a frequent use of Arab territorial waters (as distinct from Arab ports) by Persian ships is not unlikely to provoke embarrassing incidents, and that some difficulty may be experienced in making clear to the local rulers the distinction between territorial waters and ports. Probably the best course will be that the Resident (to whom 5000 3.33 . / copies/copies of all this correspondence are being sent) should take such opportunities as he can to make the position clear and to impress on the local rulers the necessity for keeping a close watch on the activities in their waters of Persian vessels with a view to a protest being i made without delay in any case in which those vessels appear to be abusing the right of innocent passage. 7 . I am sending copies of this letter, which incidentally covers the points raised in Admiralty letters M.02114/33 to Seal at the Admiralty.CCrY SENT BY Warner at the Foreign Office about the use of Muscat waters by Persian vessels and the right of innocent $ pas sage • N May I refer to the last paragraph of Warner's letter to you on the same subject dated the 15th August, dealing with the cancellation of the Muscat Proclamation. We understand that this Proclamation gives Great Britain the same powers as it gives Persia and we hope therefore that if any action is taken to cancel it the utmost care will be exercised to ensure that our powers remain unimpaired. I suppose it would be comparatively easy I j ^ 5 to save the powers (which as touching territorial waters &gt;- j are presumably identical) which were conferred upon ourselves and Italy in the 1903 Proclamation. j of this letter Yours sincerely. .oui.t n j am sen ^i n g a C opy of this letter to Warner. No. 3 4 24 '”-.1933 J. G. Laithwaite, Esq.— — —August, 1933. tt.02114/33. Dear Warner, With reference to your letter ^.4435/114/34 date* the 15th August, t write to say that the Admiralty are in general agreement with the views expressed In your letter to Laithwaite of even date and number. We would, however, like to point out with reference to the draft w Articles concerning the legal statue of the Territorial Sea' that these do not recognise innocent passage as a right, which has always been the attitude of Hie Majesty’s Government. We should say that. Innocent passage being a right, there ia no power in the coastal state to prohibit passage but only to regulate it. The British view is, we think, correctly stated in the reply sent in on behalf of His Majesty's Government to the questionnaire which preceded the 1930 Conference. With regard to your enquiry whether there is any special usage at variance with the right of innocent J?.A. Warner, KBq. Foreign Office, S.W.l. passagepassage In the Gulf, nothing of thle kind has eyer come to our ^otioe as far aa I know* TSven if there were such a usage, we should regard it as important to break it down, since parte of the Hooka Channel are probably in Persian territorial waters • a fact which leads us to attach considerable importance to ensuring that the Persian Government are not given any excuse for demanding that notification is necessary every time one of H*M. ships visits Iraq* As for the captured vessel alleged to have been in company with the Persian gunboat, we think that the status of this ship differs from that of s prize properly so called, the last mentioned being a result of the exercise of a belligerent right and not of the power inherent in a sovereign to arrest his subjects or their property. We feel that the bringing of this captured vessel into foreign territorial waters strictly speaking involves exercise of a sovereign right within the juris diction of a foreign power and is therefore illegal; but that e e • e ethat, bearing in mind the Rooka Channel, it would be unwise to emphasise this point too strongly since it might well be Iraq would wish to take Teasels captured for smuggling offences into the Shatt-al-Arab. There is also the possible use of this river for prises of war. We are inclined to think therefore that the safest grounds on which to base a protest would have been the deliberate and unnecessary anchoring within territorial waters and the unnecessary duration of the ship*a stay. Such a protest would not conflict with the British view that vessels exercising the right of innocent passage have the right to anchor when this is incidental to navigation or in the case of distress. We think that it is clear from the papers that the Persian vessel anchored deliberately and with a definite intention of staying in Muscat paters. . j a .4 a I am sending a copy of this letter to Laithwaite at the India office and enclosing a copy of a letter tohim about the cancellation of the Muscat Proclamation.informing us that he had already protested to the Persian Government. 2. As I explained to you orally, our legal advisers pointed out that the question whether notification had 'been made to the Persians regarding the procedure desired by the Arab rulers for visits of Persian warships to their ports was really irrelevant to the present case, since it appeared that no port had been visited. Mallet, as you will have seen, has protested, among other things, against the 'visit' of the Persian ships 'to Khasab'. Prom the COPY SENT BY MH MAIL J.G. Laithwaite, Esq. of.. 7^1 33 ^ correspondence/ COPY SENT TO Uy MA , 4 M .4 n ijA correspondence contained in your official letter referred to above it seems a bit doubtful whether in fact the port of Khasab was visited: the ships are said to have steamed past the port, and to have anchored some distance away, though still in sight of the town* But we don f t think that there is much harm in this* If the Persians like to deny that the port was actually visited, they are welcome to do so: at least they cannot retort (as we had feared when we sent our telegram No* 119) that the grounds of the protest are insubstantial in the light of ordinary international practice. 3* As regards the other heads of Mallet 1 s protest, as described briefly in his telegram, we are inclined to think that they can be justified by considerations of international practice* Subject to any observations which the Admiralty may wish to make, we believe that the views of His Majesty 1 s Government concerning the rights of passage of foreign warships through territorial waters are fairly represented by the draft ’'Articles concerning 'the legal status of the Territorial Sea' drawn up at the Hague Conference in 1930* According to these (Article 12), 'As a general rule, a coastal state will not forbid tne passage/’’passage of foreign warships in its territorial sea and will M not require a previous authorisation or notification. The ’’coastal state has the right to regulate the conditions of ’’such passage.” The commentary explains that this only reproduces existing practice, and that a state has the power ”in exceptional cases”, to prohibit the passage of foreign warships in its territorial sea. Under Article 3 ’’passage ’’includes stopping and anchoring, hut in so far only as ’’the same are incidental to ordinary navigation or are ’’rendered necessary by force ma.ieure or by distress”. 4. That Persia and Muscat are not in direct relations does not affect the fact that, in accordance with general practice, Persian ships of war would be entitled to innocent passage through Muscat territorial waters. 5. Assuming, therefore, that the Admiralty agree with us as to the general acceptability of the above-quoted definition of the general practice, it would apply in the present case unless there exists in the Persian Gulf some well-established local rule or usage rendering it inapplicable. As you will see from the enclosed, we are asking the Admiralty for information on this point. If there/tnere is sucii a local rule, it will be necessary to consider now it affects tne legality of the reported ^ actions of the Persian snips. Alternatively, if there is no such local rule, how far are those actions compatible with tne general practice as above defined? 6. On tne assumption, that the general rule is applicable in tne Gulf, we think that so far as we can make out the actual facts, the action of the Persian ships went, in some respects at any rate, beyond what could be justified under the Hague rules. Mallet’s first and third heads of protest seem to be justified, since neither the use of Khor Kawi as a base, nor the keeping of a captured dhow under arrest in Muscati waters, are covered by tne definitions quoted above. Tne anchoring of tne Persian vessels and the captured dhow in territorial waters does not appear in any case to have been justified under Article 3 of the Hague rules. The only point which seems at all awkward is the fact that on tne evidence at our disposal it may be difficult to prove that Khor Kawi was used as a base. Even, however, if tne protest is met by denials of fact, we think that it will have served a useful/useful purpose in that it will have reminded tne Persians international practice is. 7. We should he glad to learn whether you are in general agreement with our views. I am sending a copy of this letter to Seal, of the Admiralty, in the letter of which X enclose copy, and if it turns out that there is any appreciable divergence of opinion it may perhaps be simplest in the long run to hold a small meeting to discuss the matter orally&gt; as we think. Mallet should be sent further instructions soon. 8. I gather that in the meantime you are considering (l) whether the cancellation of the Muscat Proclamation can reasonably be effected at once without notifying the Persians and without attracting their attention, and (2) whether the Proclamation should at once be cancelled even if either or both of these conditions cannot be fulfilled.

Please see Bushire despatch of 3rd July on P.Z.4457/33 helow, describing the alleged infringement of Muscat territorial waters by Persian patrol vessels. The despatch speaks for itself and it is perhaps unnecessary to summarise it. As the Resident admits, our story is incomplete or does not admit of proof on many points of detail, but on a broad view there definitely appears to be a sufficiently strong case on which to protest on behalf of the Muscat Government to the Persians. We shall be on perfectly firm ground in contending that whatever the rights or wrongs of the particular incident, the Persians ^ entering Muscat waters without notification (Sir R. Hoare has confirmed, in reply to a private enquiry from the Foreign Office, that he has made the notification referred to in paragraph 4 of Bushire despatch under discussion to the Persians) and without apparently any excuse based on stress of weather or running short of water, etc. a* * 2. Admittedly there is some risk that the Persians may reply to any protest that they were, in fact, exercising their rights under the Muscat Proclamation of 1898, referred to paragraph 6 of Colonel Fowle* s despatch. But as the Resident remarks, even if they do, we shall have cleared the air as regards this Proclamation and will have no difficulty in securing its cancellation or modification by the Muscat Government, while our point as regards notification discussed in the preceding paragraph will remain a good one.3 On general grounds it is most desirable to take notice without further delay of the activities of the Persian Navy and the present case, while not perhaps ideally strong, is probably as good a pretext as any. The Foreign Office are sympathetic and took advantage of Colonel Fowle’s recent visit to London to discuss the despatch with him generally. 4. I attach a draft letter to the Foreign Office.Draft Paper. IMPORTANT. The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S. W. 1. 1712a 5000 3.33 P z. political Department. DRAP T LETTER. Sir, I am directed hy the Secretary of State for India to refer to Bushire despatch No.789-S, of 3rd July, of which copies were sent to the Foreign Office under India Office printed letter of 25th July, No.P.Z.4457/33, on the subject of an alleged infringement of Muscat territorial waters by Persian patrol vessels. 2. As regards para.4 of Colonel Fowle’s despatch, the Secretary of State understands that Sir R.Hoare has confirmed that the Persian Govt, have been informed that notification will be required by the rulers of the Arab principalities of the Persian Gulf before the visits of Persian warships to their ports. 3. While, as Colonel Fowled despatch shows, the information available appears to be incomplete or possibly unreliable in respect of certain points of detail, the Secretary of State is in entire agreement with the Political Resident that on a broad view of the incident there is a strong enough case on which to base a protest tc the Persian Government, if not in respeotif of the incident as a whole, at any rate in respect of the failure to give prior notification of a visit to the Muscat Government,, and he trusts that his view will he shared hy the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. He recognises that the Persian Government may endeavour to justify their action hy a reference to the Muscat Proclamation 1898, to which reference is made in paragraph 6 of Colonel Fowle’s despatch. On this the Secretary of State is in agreement with the Resident, and, as Colonel Fowle remarks, if appeal is in fact made to the Proclamation in questiop, there should he no difficulty in securing its cancellation or modification hy the Muscat Government. 4. It is the more important in Sir Samuel Hoare f s view to take notice of the present incident in 'that the activities of the Persian Navy on the Arah littoral of the Gulf are likely unless carefully watched, prejudicially to affect British prestige in that area, antjL he directs me to draw particular attention in this connection to paragraph 6 of the report from the Commander of H.M.S.

H.M.S. 'Fowey* reports (vide Senior Naval Officer's telegram dated the 18$h June) that fine weather prevailed during the time the Persian vessels were at Khassab, and that no request for water or provisions was made, No excuse therefore exists for encroachment either under stress of weather or running short of water, etc. CJ- K' — 6. Under the Muscat Notification of 1898, Persia has rights of search of Muscat vessels on the High Seas (vide paragraph 4 of my letter to the Government of India No# 341' s (13 B to Tehran A 342^&amp;_to Secretary of State for India and Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf), dated the 6th April 1933, and India Office letter of 27th April, No. P.Z. 2420/33, to the Admiralty), but this would not cover the capture of a Persian vessel in Muscat territorial waters. But the Muscat Proclamation of the same date (vide paragraph 3 of my letter quoted above) does give permission to Persian vessels of war to search for arms in Muscat territorial waters vessels flying the Persian flag. 7. It is possible, therefore, that the Persian Government in reply to any protest we may make, may quote the Muscat Proclamation mentioned in the preceding parar graph. It is quite likely, however, that the Persian Government/3 Sir; Government may not have this Proclamation on their records, or, if they have, may have lost sight of it. If this is not the case they will doubtless quote it, in which case we will find no difficulty in getting the Muscat Government to cancel or modify it, and the position will he clarified. 8. I had intended putting the matter before you by telegram, and suggesting a strong protest to the Persian Government, as there were obvious advantages in such a protest - if made at all- being made expeditious ly. It was equally obvious, however, that our case should be as strong as possible. 1 therefore set certain discreet enquiries on foot. 9. If, for instance, it oould have been discover ed that within a reasonable time after the 13th June (see paragraph 2 of H.M.3. rt Fowey # s H report) a Persian launch had taken a captured Persian dhow into a Persian port, this v/ould have been substantial proof on our side as against probable denials on the part of the Persian Government. A glance at the map will show that Bandar Abbas, Lingah, or Henjam, were the most probable ports for the dhow to be taxen to, and that the launch in fl question was probably based on Bandar Abbas. The launch being a small one (vide paragraph 3 of E.M.S. *Fowey # s* report) would not be likely to make a long voyage, especially when escorting a •'prize*. The more distant ports of Bushire and Mohammerah, on which launches are also based, would be unlikely, especially the latter. Accordingly I mad^the necessary telegraphic enquiries frcin the consular authoirities at Bandar/4 Bandar A.'b'bas with regard to that place and Lingah, and at Mohammerah, and from the Senior Naval Officer with regard to Henjam. The replies were, however, in the negative, no captured dhow r had 'been brought into these places. Local enquiries here as to Bushire were to the same effect. This line of enquiry, therefore proved abortive. 10. I made further discreet enquiries in Bushire as to the numbers borne by the Customs launches. There was a launch, No. 5, but its Captain # s name was Mohamjrfed bin Ali Mohammed, and not Abdullah bin Mohammed (vide Senior Naval Officer’s telegram of 18th June}, it was based on Mohammerah, and had been there for about a month, Ahmed Shaikh 'Could not be traced. The Customs launch based on Bandar Abbas was No. 6, Captain’s name Abdullah Pashmi- * l Pashmi rt being a nickname. 11. As my enquiries had produced little result, in the circumstances I thought it best to wait until I should be in possession of H.M.S. ’♦Powey’s* despatch on the subject, and then report the matter to you at length by letter. Though the further confirmatory evidence I had hoped tr is not forthcoming, personally I am convinced that the incident took place as reported by the Wall (Governor) of Khassab. H.M.S. 'Fowey* arrived at Khassab only the day after the Persian armed vessel had left, and Commander Sir Philip Bowyer-Hmyth’s report of the incident he collected there is most circumstantial. In fact unless we assume - -which is incredible - that the Wall and his many witnesses invented thdwhole circumstantial story, we must I think accept/5 accept this story as correct in the main. There are, of course, certain details in which it - the story - appears to conflict with the information which I have Persian hieroglyphic for 5 is not nixfc unlike that for 6 if written in a certain way and might he mistaken for launch No. 9 which is based on Bandar Abbas is called have a strong enough case Persian Government.

Sir, I have the honour to submit the following report of a visit of Persian vessels to the vicinity of Khassab. At daylight on Wednesday 14th June H ROWEY M anchored near Khassah to transfer a cot case to a living Boat for transport to Basrah. A native bfoat came off with a message from the Wall that a Persian man-of-war Had visited Khassab the previous day and had taken away some dhows. If there was any truth in the report it seemed advisable to get all the available info-Tnation, and for the ship to be seen by the local inhabitants, whose confidence may have been shaken. I weighed and anchored again closer to the village, and sent a message •*-0 the Wall to come and give me the particulars himself. 3. Yhe Wali, who is a sensible and balanced type of man, brought with him several men who knew something of the occurrence. After a protracted interview the following appeared to be the facts About £200 on Monday 12th the Wali observed the lights of a small power driven vessel passing close by the anchorage of Khassab. She evidently passed inside the five fathom line on the plan on chart 3599. He appears to have recognised her then as being Persian, though how, is not qhite clear. Phe following morning she could be seen from Khassab anchored close inshore under Has Shaikh Masud. I estimate her position as 26? 15’ H; 56° 13.5 f E. The Wali sent a man off to her. '’'here were three vessels, a Persian vessel with armed men on board., a Persian sailing dhow with auxilliary motor, and a dhow which had been captured, ''he Persian vessels/ The Senior Maval Officer, Persian Gulf Division.vessels were alongside each other and the captured dhow made fast astern* It is impossible to identify the first vessel from their description. She was small, painted white,and bore the number tT? ive f -Shown photo graphs of the Persian Sloops and Patrol Boats the man seemed sure that it was not one of then. He said it was not unlike a photograph of the 'Pahlavi', but looked smaller. It appears to have been either the latter, or a customs launch. I'he auxilliary dhow was of a type in general use by Persian revenue officials, ^he captured dhow belonged to a Baluchi who is a native of Bandar Sirkk and therefore a Persian subject. I’he cargo was stated to be sugar. She had come from Pabai• I'he man sent by the Wali did not go on board the first vessel, but went to the captured dhow. It was not clear if this was by choice or not. Ib-e Interpreter in the dhow toid him that they had been anchored for two previous days at Jezirat ,Ghanam - shown a sketch plan the messenger said that that meant in IChor Kawi. 'Piey caught the dhow at sea off the we c t cost of Has Sheikh ilasud about opposite T&gt; as al Jadi. He did not know the distance from the coast when caught , nor was the time of capture established. He did not know if the dhow resisted capture. By the time the messenger had reached Khassab on his return the ships had weighed and sailed Horthward. 'he Wali was satisfied ^hat they were no longer in the vicinity, otherwise I said* I would go and look for them. 4. After the Wali had gone back to the town 1 went on shore to return his visit, taking ano+her officer with me, and two sailors to act as orderlies in order to make the visit as formal as possible. On my return the ship weighed and proceeded to Hen jam. 5. '’'here is not much doubt that the captured dhow was engaged in the hitherto common and lucrative smuggling trade between the Arabian and the Persian coasts, and that she was caught red-handed by the Persian revenue authorities. These my have been operating some distance frora their own coast, or even inside territorial waters; but the main complaint, and the only one made by the Wall, is that Ter si an/-3- Persiar veBsels with armed men on board, visited Muscati waters without previous notice or adequate reason» 6. From our point of view the significance of the incident appears to lie in the inevitable damage to our maritime prestige in the Gulf if such incidents are repeated without tangible opposition fror^is* Twice within the last fortnight, at Doha and at Mabai I have been asked by responsible Arabs questions bearing directly on our ability to protect Arab dhows from Persian molestation. I believe the Shaikh of Kuwait has expressed similar doubts. ^here seems to be a growing feeling of apprehension among the Arab rulers about this. With Persia a member of the League of Nations, entitled to arbitration^instead of the direct action the Arab understands, there nay be more foundation for this apprehension than it would be politic to admit. 7 .

Lear Seal, Many thanks for your letter of yesterday about the Arms Traffic Convention. The proposals which have now been circulated by the Foreign Office for discussion this afternoon seem prima facie attractive (subject to a definition of 'non-Persian vessels' which will cover Bahrein, Koweit, and the other Arab Sheikhdoms to v/hich claims of varying importance are or have been put forward by Persia) and if we can reach agreement on this basis the question of Persian rights of inspection of Arab vessels under the Arms Traffic Convention will no longer be of active importance. But by way of clearing the ground I might place on record our present point of view on certain of the points that have arisen. Position of the Arab Sheikhdoms in relation to treaties and International Conventions . 2. Bahrein and Koweit are independent Arab principalities, under British protection, but not British protectorates. The Trucial Sheikhdoms (including Pp.tar) are as stated in P.G,13, 'independently administered tribal principalities governed by independent Arab Sheikhs'; entitled to projection from us in varying degrees. By agreement, the foreign relations of all the above are in the hands of His Majesty^ Government, and the Rulers may E.A &gt; Seal Esq., have ALMIRALTY •have no correspondence or relations with any foreign power or its representative* Muscat is an independent State in special Treaty relations with us, and entitled in certain circumstances to a measure of protection from us, hut with foreign treaties and foreign relation^6f its own* 3. For general political reasons we are anxious to keep the foreign relations of ax] the above States (including even Muscat so far as practicable) entirely in our own hands; and, save in the case of Muscat, which under pressure from us acceded to the Arms Traffic Convention of 1919, we have therefore never contemplated or wished to encourage, their independent accession to International agreements or conventions* On the other hand, so as to avoid any ground for complaint from interested foreign powers, we aim at securing that in practice these States shall so far as possible (i.e. making allowance for special local circumstances) conform to the provisions of such Conventions as His Majesty’s Government adhere to* But the States are not in fact legally bound in any way by such conventions in the absence of specific a&amp;h*.;r'-nce either by the Rulers themselves or by His Majesty’s Government on their behalf and with their authority. It is correct in these circumstances to say that the adherence of His Majesty’s Government to an instrument such as the Arms Traffic Convention would not by itself impose any obligation on the Arab principalities of the Persian Gulf. Persian rights of inspection under the Arms Traffic Convention of 1925 * 4. The Political Resident advises us that in practice the dhows of all our Arab proteges in the Gulf almost invariablyinvariably fly some sort of flag, either the Trucial flag, a 'white-red-halved flag' (cf.H.M.S. Hastings's letter No.965/25 of 6th November 1931), or the flag of Bahrein, Qatar, K owe it or Muscat. On the assumption stated above that the adherence of His Majesty's Government to an Arms Traffic Convention would not by itself bind the Arab Rulers, the ships of those Rulers flying either the Trucial flag or the flag of Bahrein, Koweit, Muscat or Q.atar, would fall outside Categories (a) and (b) in paragraph 1 of Annexe II, Section 2 Subsection 5 (page 54 of Cmd.3448 of 1929) of the Convention of 1925, and Persia would have no legal right of inspection of such vessels# We have not I fear in our recent discussions sufficiently appreciated that this was the case, and are grateful to the Admiralty for emphasizing it. 5 . We feel at the same time in the first place that the 1925 Convention as it stands is so loosely drawn that we might find it difficult in practice to make an effective protest against the search by a Persian vessel of an Arab dhow flying the flag of an Arab principality which was not a party to theConvention. Secondly, and this is the argument which has carried most weighT. with us, and which the Political Resident would probably, 7/e think, endorse, there is the extreme difficulty as we see it ofmaking sure that Persia will not abuse any rights of inspection she may be given (particularly if they are not too precisely defined)# They v/ould probably not do too scrupulous in suggesting that a dhow improperly searched by them was in fact flying no flag, and we might find it difficult to prove conclusively that this was not the case. ExistingX Existing n^-chts 01 ms- 6 . Persia under the Muscat authority of 1898 referred to in paragraph 3 of the Arras Traffic Memorandum on p.151 of P.G.13 has rights of search of Muscat vessels on the high seas. If she showed any sign of realising that she had this right, we should probaoly tninh it necessary to advise the Sultan of Muscat to ancel the proclamation of 1898, and substitute for it an authority confined to His Majesty*s Ships, (it will be necessary to consider carefully the question whether Muscat should or should not be advised to aocede to any .Arms*1 raxfic Convention which might give Persia rights against her ships - conditions have changed materially since 1919)* Secondly, it seems possible in view of your letter, that she may retain some rights of inspection under the Brussels Act of 1890. Prima facie we are inclined to feel some doubt as to this, and it is pernaps not irrelevant first that she does not appear at any stage in the recent discussions to have claimed or referred to the possible existence of such rights, and second that the governing instrument as regards slavery is at present the Anglo-Persian Convention of 1882, which is wholly one sided and confers rights of search of Persian vessels on His Majesty*s ships without conferring rights of search of any kind on Persia. 7 # The position then is we accept your view that so long as the Arab principalities of the Gulf do not themselves accede or authorise us to accede on their behalf, to an instrument such as the Arms Traffic Convention of 1925, and ao long as their vessels fly a ilag which is not the flag of anH.C.P., Persia appears to have no legal right of inspection as Such vessels under the Convention: thatthat Persia in our view only very doubtfully possess any rights ofinspect ion at the moment (and quite possibly none save in respect of Muscat vessels which could be withdrawn without delay if necessary): that we have been and are most reluctant to see her acquire any such rightsi that subject to this point being adequately safeguarded we have however no objection to the principle of special zonen, and that prima facie we are inclined departmentally to think that subject to the point mentioned in paragraph 1 above, the latest Poreign Office proposals may afford a solution which whil making it possible to maintain the principle of the special zones will equally safeguard the interests of our Arab protege's. 7.

They do not contain the passage quoted in paragraph 4 above from the l us cat notification. 6. The uscat proclamation and notification resulted from the greement of lb97 between trie British and Persian Governments, and the Persian Goveriimcnt specifically asxed for the co-operation of the iluscat Tovernzaent. In the erse of Bahrain and Kuwait however, though it is apparent that the action was consequent on the Britiah-Persian / greement of 1B97, tlui i or is i au Goverzment doeo not - so far as i can trace from my records - appear to hr ve been consulted.

The same remarks would seed to apply to the Bahrain and Kuwait proclamations. *ie possible objection to the Qaucell&amp;tion of these proclamations would, however, be, not from the Persisn point of view, but ours, since the abolition of the Persian, would pIso mean that of the British, right oi search, for both 1902 merely prohibited the importation or arms tor sale tneir territories, or the exportation therefroia.

British Ministe r at t he P er si ah Min i st er f or Foreign Affairs, 3Ler lor i^oreiCT December' 1597 ^~ 'date ehran. ^sr to Her Majesty’s Government have information that large quantities of arms and arrnunition are being exported from Great Britain to the southern ports of Persia, and also to Muskat and Bahrein, from which places they are smuggled across into Persia. Her Majesty's Government have reason to believe that a considerable portion of these consignments find their v/ay into Afghanistan, and eventually reach the tribes on.the North-west Frontier of India. The importation of arms into Persia being strictly prohibited, this traffic is illegal, and as contrary to Persian as it is to British interests. I have therefore received instructions from the Marquess of Salisbury to enquire Pf iour Excellency whether, with a view to stopping this illicit traffic, the Persian Government will allow Her Majesty’s ships of war to seise and hand over to the Persian authorities for confiscation all cargoes of arms and ammunition owned by British or Persian subjects which may be found in Persian waters destined for importation into Persia. In the event of the importation of arms and ammunition for the use of the Persian Government a notification to Her Majesty’s Legation would be sufficient to prevent seizure by Her Majesty’s ships. 1/2. I am also instructed to enquire of the Persian G-overnment whether they will join Per Majesty’s Government in requesting the Sultan of Muskat to issue a notice warning his subjects and others residing in Muskat from exporting arms and ammunition to Persia or British India, as the importation of such merchandise into those countries is strictly prohibited, and asking that British ships of war may be permitted to take action in the waters of Muskat for preventing such traffic by the subjects of Great Britain, Persia, and Muskat. I shall be much obliged if Your Excellency will favour me with an early reply for communication to Her Majesty’s Government. ( ii ) Note from the Sadr-i-Asan to Hr.C.Hardinae.British Minister at Tehran' dated 16th Deceniber 1897 . Your letter on the prevention of the importation of arms and ammunition, written in accordance with instructions from Lord Salisbury, ha.s been received and submitted to the appreciation of His Majesty the Shah. The opinion of the British Government that the importation of arms and ammunition into Persia should be strictly prohibited, is shared by the Persian Government. This Government has always sought to prevent the arming of the tribesmen as well as the inhabitants of the towns and frontiers. Since, in this matter, the opinions of the two Governments are in unison, and as the measures to be taken are in many respects similar, the Government is prepared with the most perfect unanimity to meet the views of Her Britannic Majesty’s Legation; further, the wishes of Her Majesty’s Government, viz., that in addition to such measures as may be taken by Persian officials, Her Majesty’s ships should examine and search all merchant/merchant vessels trading in the Persian Gulf, and confiscate and hand over to the Persian Government all prohibited arms found on board, are approved by His Imperial Majesty the Shah, Should arms or amnunition be purchased to the order of the Persian Government, information of such purchases will be given to Her Britannic Majesty's Legation, so that such arms may be beyond the effects of the prohibition. The Persian Government is also ready to join with Her Majesty's Government in requesting the Sultan of Muskat to notify in the ports and territories of Muskat that arms should not be imported from that side into Persia or Hindustan, also that English ships should exercise in regard to search and confiscation the same rights in Muskat as in Persian waters.

As to the second draft, we have already sent to you a letter containing our compliance with what you desire in respect of preventing the sending of arms and ammunition to the two countries - India and Persia - as is plainly stated in the Notification. We have/have complied with it most willingly; and we associate with the British and Persian Governments in the arrangements that are made and will be hereafter made for the suppression of this trade in arms and ammunition. With regard to what you have hinted to us, about representing this matter to the great Government in the best way possible, so that we should be (not only) guaranteed against any loss, but (adso) derive benefit by what we are doing to help the Government, we shall most gladly exert to the utmost in that matter, and we firmly believe that the Government and yourself will not be pleased with any loss to us. We shall thank the Government and yourself for that. May you always remain in a good state. And salaams. (ii) Notification by the Sultan of Muscat, d ated 15th January 18^8' . Be it known to such of our subjects as see this that, whereas the British and Persian Governments have represented to us that they are desirous of preventing introduction of arms and ammunition into India and Persia, and that there is reason to think that many are exported from Mu skat and taken to those two above-named countries, we have resolved to join them and to assist them as far as it lies in our power in suppressing this trade in arms and ammunition between Muskat and India and Persia. We therefore warn (our subjects) that all the arms and ammunition sent to those two countries will be confiscated, and those engaged in the trade will be punished, as the introduction of arms and/and ammunition into India and Persia is prohibited by the Governments of those two countries, and, therefore, illegal. In future our Muscat flag will be no protection to vessels carrying the said arms and ammunition from our dominions to India and Persia* (This is written) that it may be known. (iii) Proclamation by the Sultan of Muscat, dated 15th January 1898* Be it known to all who see it That we have given permission to British and Persian vessels of war to search vessels carrying their and our flags in our territorial waters and to confiscate all arms and ammunition (weapons of war) in them if those arms and ammunition are intended for Indian and Persian ports, and if they are the property of British, Persian, or Muscat subjects. We have also given permission to those vessels of war to search Muscat vessels in Indian and Persian waters suspected to contain arms and ammunition lor Indian and Persian ports, and to confiscate the said arms and ammunition. (This is written) that it may be known* III* Notification by the Sultan of Muscat, dated 17th October 1905* To all whom it may concern - Be it known that, in pursuance of an understanding come to by the Governments of Great Britain and Italy, the importation of arms and warlike stores to those portions of th# African Coast and islands (including Socotra) lying to the northof Ras Aseer (i*e* CapooGuardafui), which are under the British Protectorate, and also to those parts of the African Coast which are under the Italian Protectorate, has been prohibited* Accordingly, at the request of the British Government pursuant to her understanding with the Government of Italy, I hereby notify the said prohibition* Be it therefore Known that any native craft transporting arms or warlike stores to the localities in question will incur the risk of confiscation, and that I have granted the authority to British men-of-war to search, on my behalf, vessels which there is reason to suspect in this connection in Muscat and Oman waters, and similarly to search Muscat craft on the high seas if reason exists for suspecting them. Furthermore, I hereby grant authority to Italian ships of war also to search suspected Muscat vessels either in territorial waters or on the high seas* FEYSAL-BIN-TURXI, Sultan of Muscat</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000602.0x000202_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2971</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x000202</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2971</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 20/15 'Muscat: Infringement of Muscat territorial waters by Persian vessels'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1933/1934</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-07-06T22:04:36</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (98 folios)</extent><extent>The file is arranged in chronological order from the back to the front.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 101; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>Correspondence concerning reports of a Persian warship operating in Muscat territorial waters. The vessel was seen off Khassab, Oman. Much of the correspondence discusses what grounds exist for a British protest to the Persian Government over the incident, with reference to international law and agreements between the British and the Persians (1897) and the British and the Sultan of Muscat (1898) (see folios 95-100), upon which the Persian right to be in Muscat waters was based. Details of other similar incidents to be used against the Persians are included in the papers (folios 3-4 and 18). Further correspondence deals with the need to retain British rights should the Sultan annul any historical proclamations connected to the matter.The principal correspondents include officials at the Political Residency in the Persian Gulf, Government of India (Foreign and Political Department), India Office, Admiralty, Foreign Office, British Embassy in Tehran, and the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Correspondence between the Council of Regency in Muscat and the Wali of Khassab is also contained within the file.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Admiralty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Embassy in Iran, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Oman</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Territorial waters</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x000202#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
