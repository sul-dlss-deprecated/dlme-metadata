ING THE PERIOD 5th - ifiTH AUGUST KABUL, THE MILITARY ATTACHE AND FICER AIR STAFF (PLANS) AIR $&gt;• g-apply of spitfire vm Aircraft to the Afghan ftnyar-m™ r,t. . U&lt;&gt; A general exchange of the most recent information regarding this problem was of assistance to both sides, it was decided that the supclv of five years' spares for the Spitfire VIII should be based on 160 hours flying per aircraft per year. 2 • Supply Of 12 Avi o X .IX aircraft to th* Afghan Government. . After discussion it was recommended that (a) The delivery and assembly of the Avros after arrival bv ship at Karachi should be effected by a representative of the firm selling the aircraft assisted where possible by the R.A.F. ° (b) The five years’ spares required with the aircraft (i.e. two years* spares to accompany the aircraft and three years' spares to be supplied later) be based on 4 qq hours flying per aircraft per year. (c) As S/Ldr. Doe could not commit Air headquarters in anv way regarding th^ training of Afghan pilots on the two engined Avro aircraft the Legation should write in officially and ask the R.A.F. in India to ’ assist where possible. The British pilot instructor in Kabul be sent to Karachi with Afghan air crews for the Avros to assist in training them. ^ • &amp;l^£pl y of 5» Hangars to the Afghan Government . It was recommended that an Engineer officer be sent to Kabul at the end of August or early in September to advise the Afghan Government on preliminary cement work and again in November to supervise the erection of the hangars. 4 . This officer together with the British pilot instructor and the Military Attache to discuss with the Afghan authorities : - (a) the employment of a few skilled labourers from India; (b) the best time for an method of delivery of the hangars* (c) the delivery of the hanagars destined for Kandahar and^erat.

Doe go into this question on arrival at Delhi with a view to deciding the most suitable method of delivery at Peshawar by the Director of the Disposals Board. 5 • Repair oiLpropellers f or Italian Romeo aircraft . S/Ldr. Doe was asked to take up this question with o/C. R.A.F.Station, Peshawar, as two of these propellers have been under repair in India since the autumn of 1945. 6 • The British Pilot instructor . The case for an extension of the contract of W/Cdr. King for a 4th y.ai wao discussed. S/Ldr. Doe was of the opinion that the period of service oi the^British pilot instructor with the Afghan Air Force should be two yearti with an extension to three years in exceptional circumstances., H.M s Minister ^considered that the R.A.F. Instructor reached his maximum Air T? rc !! after years in Kabul, but agreed that y tf rS 3 ^ oulci normally be the maximum. He quoted the example of J?a °? e / Ul1 vall i e t0 the Afghan Air Force authorities had only ' ^ er |® d ^ ^ i3 drd year. After this discussion this Legation's telegram No. S7 dated 11th August 1946 was issued. S/Ldr. Doe considered that it v .ouId be of value if^H.M f s Minister would write a personal letter to the A.o.C. Air H.Q.

Doe should on his return to Delhi explain the situation from the Kabul point of view. 8 • MetBonological Services . It was agreed that the Military Attache should secure the consent of the War Ministry for the training of Afghan Air Force meteorological personnel in India. This is not regarded as a difficult problem since the Afghan Government are anxious for such training providing no difficult conditions are attached to the training. £• Rocket firing a N ^aratus . The Afghan Government have been informed that rocket firing apparatus cannot be fitted to the Avro XIX aircraft. S/Ldr. Doe stated that the British Air Ministry are not in favour of supplying rocket firing apparatus to foreign Governments at present. The Afghan Government while anxious to secure the apparatus are prepared to leave the matter as it stands at present, but will probably ask for the supply of this apparatus with one or more of the Spitfire aircraft. 10. Method of correspondence with Air Headquarters . It was agreed that the British pilot instructor in Kabul should be permitted to correspond direct with A.H.Q* India on administrative and mino: problems connected with the British instructors attached to the Afghan Air Force. Such correspondence to be forwarded through the Military Attache in sealed cover. S/Ldr. Doe made a request that the Military Attache should correspond with Air Staff plans A.H.Q. India on all matters affecting equipment required by the Afghan Air Force. It, was agreed that this should be done. 11. Supply of 1 QQ octane Petrol . The Afghan Government have stated that they are unable to obtain 100 Octane petrol from their agents, the Burmah Oil Company. As 500 gallons of this type of aviation spirit is required for the test of the sample aix: Spitfire Mill, S/Ldr. Doe stated that he would take up the qdestion of the supply of this amount by the R.A.F. Peshawar. 12. Liaison visits . It was suggested by S/Ldr Doe that a Staff ofiicer from A.H.Q. India should visit Kabul once a year for the purpose of discussing any out standing problems connected with the Afghan Air Force. Military Attache suggested that the British pilot instructor attached to the Afghan Air Force should pay liaison visits to A.K.Q. India, once or twice per annum It was agreed that both these types of liaison visits would be valuable. S/Ldr. Doe suggested that Group Capt. Murray, Command intelligence Officer, should pay a visit to Kabul in October or November this year. H.m^ Minister agreed to the visit and details are to be aiiange^ aper. 13. su pply of a R.A.F. clerk for the M.A*8 offi ce. The M.A. stated that with H.M’s Minister's approval he had applied d to the D.M.I • in India for the temporary posting of an R.A.F. u his office in Kabul, for a period of one year. The reason for this application is that the M.A. and the British pilot instructor in Kabul carry out the duties of an Air Attache and are frequently involved m the compilation of extensive lists of spares for aircraft and the supply of all types of equipment to the Afghan Air Force. S/Ldr. Doe promised o take up this question with A.H.Q* India on his return to Delhi.t : *1 - 4 - lit 1 r E /■ m e pro- 5 41| authorities to the payment of the marriage and ration dllo mised to investigate the matter after his return tc Delhi. 0 Note; After investigation it was f ound th&amp;d^an unmarried N.C.O. of lay of £750/- pei- annum, plus a rree' house and' furniture c^qt^live/ reasonably ^ell in Kabul, it was also found th^t--fir-married N-rfi o instructor with a wife in Kabul should be able to live and save a little money on pay of £1,000/- per annum plus a free house and furniture. In the case of a married N.C.O. with a wife in England ne is sending the sum oi £30/- per month or £360/- per annum as a family allotment to his wife. (^) S/Ldr. Doe stated that R.A.F.* N.C.Os. serving in Kabul are at a disadvantage as compared with R.A.F. personnel in India, in that they do not obtain a concession of free postage for letters despatched to England under service arrangements, the lack of this concession costing the N.C.Os about Hs.25/- Indian per month. It was suggested that S/Ldr. Doe should take up this question with A.H.Q. India with a view to finding out whether it would be possible for the N.C.O. to despatch their mail to India for posting under service arrangements. (g) S/Ldr. Doe stated that in his opinion all R.A.F. personnel serving in Kabul should have free medical attention and treatment, for tfafcmselves and families by the Legation Surgeon at the Legation Hospital or their houses in Kabul. He did not think there was any hope of obtaining an allowance for the Legation Surgeon from the R.A*.F. since the free medical attention and treatment given to R.A.F. personnel by other Service doctors is normally on a reciprocal basis. (h) H.M’s Minister enquired as to whether marriage and ration allowance paid by the R.A.F. to R.A.F. instructors in Kabul would be subject to deduction of British income Taz at source, he thought that any arrangements made in respect of the pay and allowances of R.A.F. instructors in Kabul should be free of any implications which might involve the payment of British Income Tax by the Afghan Government. (i) S/Ldr. Doe recommended that the British pilot instructor be given 42 days* leave annually with pay, as is being granted at present, also thacx that the N.C.Os. be given 28 days* leave with pay per annum. The Afghan Government are at present only granting 21 days* leave with pay per annum to N.C.O* instructors, this being the pe r iod formerly granted to British civilian Air instructors engaged by the Afghan Government. The Military Attache considered that the Afghan Government would not raise any objection to the increase of the annual leave for N.C.Os. from 21 to 28 days. 16. Comments by His Majesty^ Minister . The foregoing note represents in the main the talks which we have had in Kabul during the past week. The main subject of our discussion was the conditions of service for R.A.F. personnel in Kabul (item 15). The best arrangement to my mind would be that the R.A.F. should undertake to supply a pilot instructor and such number of N.C.Os. as may be required from time to time on a fixed pay which should be agreed with the Afghan Government subject of course to periodical, say annual, reconsideration in accordance with service pay, cost of living, etc. I think the fairest thing to do is for us the decide what amount is reasonable to pay for unmarried men and to suggest that the British and Indian Governments should beat the cost of any additional allowances for married men whether in the form of increased living allowances in Kabul or for separation allowances if the families are at home. It will be difficult to persuade the Afghans to pay more for a married man than for a bachelor and in any case H.M.G. pay these allowances without getting any extra service in the case of all R.A.F. personnel. The first step is for M.A. to approach the Minister of Defence quite informally and to say that in connection with Wing Commander King*s &lt; successor and in order to put the whole case on a business-like basis in accordance with the very much higher scale of pay which is now drawr. by R.A.F. personnel it is considered that the Afghan Government should be prepared to pay the minimum wages on which suitable personnel could be secured, viz. £1,400/- a year plus a free house for the pilot instructor and for the N.C.Os. £785/- a year (I have added £35/- to the £750/- which is reasonable on account of rent for furniture which these instructors might reasonably be expected to be provided with) plus a free unfurnished house. These rates are for bachelors only. Whether anything extra would&lt; r ■ r &lt;+rt - 5 - !' E^CTl s S 4 S'i. # ) that- we will ake up with have to be paid for married men is a matter ^ »» AV n ou£ Government. When we have the Afghan reajctlBns ^Rthislproposai^we shall be able to put up definite recommendatTOTTS^t^ G^r^riiffient in the lines discussed. The only further point at issue i£ that of medical attention item 16(g) This i cannot decide myself but shall have to refer to the Government of India, The Legation Surgeon in Kabul is on the same footing as a Civil Surgeon in India, No other families in Kabul are technically entitled to his services at their houses free and it would I think be invidiouel that the R.A.F. personnel, especially N.C.Os. should be the only people entitled to send for the Legation Surgeon to their houses to attend to members of their families. It must be remembered that the Legation is three miles away. Families are under existing arrangement entitled to free treatment at the Legation Hospital. Sd/- G. F. Squire.

August, which deals with the suggested re-organisation of the Afghan Air Force, to me for comments. 2. I have closely studied the report Qnd I would like to say at the start that I consider it to be an admirable report and that I agree with it, apart from one or t * r o suggestions which I now give. 3. PRO PO SED LOCATIONS OF SQUADRONS. Although I agree that eventually it will probablv be sound to base squadrons as proposed in paragraph 3(f)(i) I cannot help feeling that it will be unwise to disperse away from KABUL until the Afghan Air Force has progressed a long way towards the ultimate desirable stage of efficiency and discipline. Apart from the difficult question of communications I feel that were units to be based away from Headquarters at Kabul and out of sightjof British personnel flying efficiency and the general standard of discipline and maintenance would quickly^leteriorate. I aonreciate the desirability of showing the f flag f but could not this be accomplished by fairly frequent flights from Kabul over the areas concerned with perhaps a stop of one or two nights at each place. The airfields suggested should, I consider, be developed and they should also be stocked so that aircraft could be detached there and operate at short notice. 4. I will now take some of the paragraphs in your report. Para 4 A (ii) . I do not think that the Romeo aircraft would be suitable for advanced flying training. It is an old and heavy aircraft and unsuited to operations at high altitude and it has a cockpit layout differing completely from any British aircraft. Moreover, spares are non-existant. The Afghans must either obtain proper advanced modern aircraft or alternatively send their pilots to India for their training. I think the latter course would be found preferable for some time to come. Para 4 B (1) . This is a difficult question. Unfortunately there /fully is no British aircraft in existence or projected, which/me*ts the requirements which you give. The G.P. Jack of all Trades aircraft has died with this war and it will not be re^vired. That there is a need for such a type, in countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Persia and N*W.F. is an undoubted fact and the matter has been considered by the Air Ministry. As thing r **i r:'pT. *stand at present the only aircraft which will at all meet IfCUL1. i - - jthe bill is the all metal Anson, which, I gather is being p - NOV 1 ^^ produced at home. It has not, of course, got the speed which you say is desirable but in other respects it should be INDIA Og£ quite suitable. I do not think that a speed of 250-300 miles2 !£ an hour is required for the type of operations in Afghanistan. Such a speed would not be compatible with an ability to land on or take off from comparatively small and high altitude aerodromes. 5. I think the Afghans were contemplating the possibility of purchasing Hurricanes. Personally, I do not advocate this as the Hurricane is now a completely obsolete type which has long passed out of production and which would prove increasingly difficult to maintain with spares. The Chief Maintenance Officer here strongly advises against the supply of Hurricanes to the Afghans. I agree with him and consider that they should aim at getting the modernised all metal Anson when it becomes available. * * last aternative would be, of course that they should get Spitfires but I do not advise this as I do not think that they would be competent to operate this aircraft and that the crash rate would be extremely high. Moreover, the high performance of the Spitfire makes it unsuitable for /ork in close, mountainous country. 6. LIGHT TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT . I fully agree with the desirability of the Afghans having a few of this type. The de Havilland ^ove which is a new small twin-engined transport should be very suitable if they can afford to get some. 7. Para 6 b (iv) . I do not think that Ghizao would be suitable. Our records here get the altitude at 13&gt;000 feet and its inaccessibili ty would make it difficult, if not impossible, to supply. Para 6 b (vi) . CHAKHANSUR. This site may be all right but according to meteorological reports the area is subject to the ! wind of 120 days* and this might well preclude operations for most of the summer. 8. R.A.F. INSTRUCTORS. I entirely agree with the recommendations that R.A.F. instructors should replace civilians. I feel strongly that British personnel working with the Afghan Air Force should set a high standard of discipline as an example to the Afghans. 9. I am fully in agreement with the rest of the report dealing with maintenance and personnel matters, particularly with the proposal to set up a Boy Apprentice Wing. 10. You will no doubt let D.M.O. know what reception the report has and I shall be most interested to see what lines they tak£. Perhaps, the recent Kunar trouble will help them to make up their minds.

Najibullah Khan said that recent events in Kunar had iraprersed Afghan Gov* rmrent witli nt'ed for transport aircraft. They would be grateful if Government of India or His Majesty* e Government could supply two such aircraft, complete with supply dropping equipment. Apert from meeting urgent military needs the machines would be useful for other purposes. 3. \ bile Kunar situation no longer justifies plea of military urgency I recommend that request be given favourable consideration. It gives us good opportunity to introduce British transport aircraft into Afghan Air Force and might incidentally pave way to establishing British influence in development of Civil Aviation in this country. See your ^ telegram No. 5323 of June 11th and Military Attache*s letter N0.4C2/A/ s' M.A» of Jun e* apth to GeneraXHgeadquar tera (copy enclosed herewith) • I should be glad of early information of prospects of supply and minimum price at which aircraft and equipment could be made available to Afghan Government. Further details of this requirement have been given to Military Attache by Afghan Chief of the General staff and I enclose a copy cf the former , s demi-official letter No. 406 /m.a. of the 14th September to General Headquarters. With regard to paragraph 4 I may say that Najibullah Khan told me that British instructors would be required temporarily to teach Afghan pilots how to operate the machines and equipment. So if this course is more convenient than that suggested by the Chiaf of the General Staff to the Military Attache/iieii* sending Afghan Pilots to India for training, I see no reason why it should not be adopted. 5. paragraphs 5 - 6 of Military Attache*© letter deal with the proposed reorganization of the Afghan Air Force.

IfiL SBSB11 • British Legation, Kabul. Dated 30th June 1945. Dear Brigadier, 1945 / Kindly refer to paragraph 5 of my D/O letter No.402 /a /MA dat ed 7th June 194o and paragraph 5 of your D/0 letter No. 6909/1/&amp;0*! dated 20th June 1945 which has just arrived. 2. Air Headquarters cay be interested in a statement made to me recently by Mr. Engert, the American Minister, regarding civil trans port aircraft. MT. Engert, who with the permission of His Majesty’s Minister sees my Weekly Summaries of intelligence, stated that he had noticed that the Minister of Defence was interested in the Beach craft type of transport aircraft and had made enquiries about them in India and America. He had received replies to the effect that Beach crafts would not be available for sale until the end of 1946 and even then only a few would be available. The American authorities had, however, suggest ed that a similar transport aircraft, the CESSNA U.C. 78 was available now in quantity and could be sold at a cost of 8,500 dollars. 3. I have no information as to whether these details have been passed on to the Afghan Government or whether the Afghans have made enquiries about transport aircraft from the American Legation, but I think it wou3id be advisable if we are to reitain our full influence in the Afghan Air Force, to provide the Afghan authorities with some information about British types of transport aircraft which can be made available for sale in the near future. About 4 of such aircraft might be required. Suggested specifications of the type of transport aircraft which might suit the Afghans are j- (a) an aircraft capable of carrying 4 or 5 passengers and 3 to 5 cwt of mail or kit. (b) have a ceiling of 20,000 feet or over for crossing the Hindu Kush. (c) an aircraft which can use small airfields of 1000 yaras or so in length at heights of 1500 to 7500 feet above sea level. (d; be capable of flying for 600 miles without refuelling. (e) be a twin-engine aircraft fairly light on expenditure of petrol. 4. I am in favour of introducing a few British light transport craft into th# Afghan Air Force for use by both the military and the postal authorities since this would tend to retain British and pre- elude foreign influence in the Air Force, would in time fJ v0 A 5 s u a hold on civil air developments in Afghanistan, would provide the Afghan Government with a few aircraft for internal passenger and postal services which could be maintained fairly cheaply by Aii iorce person nel and would assist the Afghan Air Force to build up a reserve of oilots bv giving them employment on air transport services. tional advantage from the Afghan Air Force point of view would be that %ne v could augment their meagre a^jauai budget by securing a contribu tion from the Ministry of Posts and Tele graphs in return lor the use of transport aircraft for passenger and postal services to provincial headquarter towns.

Lancaster, in consultation v/ith Wing-Commander King, Pilot- Instructor to the Afghan Air Force, has prepared a report on reorganisation for the Afghan Ministry of Defence. The aim is to bring the Air Force into line with the Arny which the Chief of the Afghan General Staff is now engaged in planning - a small, largely professional, inexpensive body, not intended to rival the forces of the great industrial powers, but thoroughly competent in the difficult task of maintaining order in the turbulent ’tribal Areas. The report proposes an ’ultimate strength of 3 trainer flights, 5 flights of general-purpose operational aircraft and one transport flight, totalling, with reserves, something over 100 aircraft. Four main airfields are proposed, at Kabul, Kandaharand Baghlan, with about a dozen satellites. Most of these fields already exist#*, though almost all will require development. The report points out tactfully that Afghanistan must M for many years to come '^be dependent on aircraft manufactured abroad,• and stresses the , advantage of obtaining all these aircraft/aircraft, together with the necessary instructors and advanced training facilities, from one country. With regard to instructors, the importance os. training Aighan officers and other ranks in storekeeping is made clear, and the point is made that it would be cheaper, quicker and more conducive to discipline - doubtless Wi'ng-Cbtinander King after his unfortunate fracas with Mr.'Bradley feels particularly strongly on this point - if they were not obtained as hitherto from aeronautical firms in England but from the R.A.P. in India. The report concludes with observations on personnel and recruitment^ which dp not require comment. It appears that the Ministry of Defence v/ere much pleased with this report, which was laid before the King personally. They consider that the suggestions made could be carried into effect without giving offence to the Russians. Col.Lancaster has emphasised that the report is entirely unofficial, and that ar\y further discussions must be carried out- at diplomatic level between the Afghan Foreign Office and the British Charge d'Affaires. The papers have been forv/arded to India with the suggestion that R.A.F. H. Q. should give them close study, bearing in mind particularly the current efforts to find aircraft suitable for the Afghans. ' Withiegard to this last point, the position at present is that India have agreed to make available on demand half a dozen Tiger Moths for training; the latest suggestion for general purpose aircraft, originating in this department on the advice of Group-Captain Hartley, is the Defiant, of which considerable stocks are now surplus in this country. *Ve are awaiting the reactions of Kabul and India to this suggestion. in eJ*. ttt tLy flcM lx ixfivu* h iyuM Ik For infoimation and any observations.

There is nothing to be done about it at the moment. We must leave the next move to the Afghan Gov rnment who, if they are serious about the reorganization, will presumably put in an official request for our assistance in regard to provision of machines and personnel. But it is all to the good that they should be so ready to accept our suggestions and these, if acted on, will consolidate the controlling position we already hold in the Afghan Air Force and perhaps assist towards letting us in on the ground floor of Afghan civil aviation. The fact that the Commandant of the Afghan Air Force (F.M. Mohd. Ihsan Khan) has just died should hasten rrther than retard reorganization. His death leaves a gap which we hope will be filled by one of the younger and more progressive Afghan Air Force officers. 3. I think therefore that it would be useful if R.A.F. Headquarters gave Lancaster*s report close study and considered how far we could help to implement it if called upon to do so by the Afghan Government. At the moment there seems to be the greatest difficulty in finding machines suitable for the Afghans, but with the complete end of hostilities perhaps this task will be easier. If we do find the right machines, I hope it will be possible to supply them at a price well within Afghan means. We simply cannot afford to let anyone else, e.g. the Russians or Am*ricans get in on this Air Force business and in my opinion we should cut prices to rock bottom when it comes to supply or make the Afghans a gift. 4.

Uo nsia arat ions affecting th 3 - ob ject. These considerations are put forward frankly, and those affecting the issue can be saia to include:- (a; Uiat Afghanistan cannot afford to maintain a large Air Force, and will be unable to defend herself effectively against attack from xhe air by a major povuer. She must therefore rely on a future world security organisation for aeip a^inut aggression or secure cue a«sistar«ce of one or more other powers. thav Afgnanistan can afford to maintain a small Air Force for ma-bitaining internal security. (c) thist the intern nee of a s/iauJ. but efficient Air Force should result in a decrease in the tot^l strength of the Army and Armed Police. (d) that the present Afghan Air Foi’ce requires to be rebuilt on sound foundations in respect of the recruitment, training ond employment of ir Force pereonnel. (cP; that new operational aircraft and equipment of types suitable for the country will nave to be purchased from abroad, though it is estimated that some 20 to 24 Hind aircraft will give 2 to 4 more years useful service providing spares are available. vf) that any new organisation introduced must allow for some slight expansion in the event of wju: oi serious internal disturbances. igj that maintenance of Aircraft is a vital factor on account of expense, r ,na a sound system of otorlng ana loaning spares and for carrying out repairs should be inaugurated. (»n; that some of the older if fleers in the air Force snould be eliminated ant employment found lor u.eia in oilier spheres or on ground auties thus allowing for tue pro.aotion oi more promising officers, ana the recruitixnt of new and young officers preferably from the Military College. (i) that sufficient trainer aircraft be purchased to pilow of initial flying training being carriea out in habul. (j) tiiat on grounds of expense the Royal Afghan Govt, may find it difficult to cater for advanced flying training in Kabul for some 3 to 5 years, and it might be cheaper to arrange for such training with the R.A.F. in India.^art-i 2 -ontd. Page 2. Uw Uiat for aXi eaoential purposes four major airfields at Kabul, Kandahar, Herat and Baghlan are sufficient to nieet the country 1 8 needs, and Uiat these onouid be develop#d as quickly as possible. In uaoltion a number of subelduary airfislds shown on the sketch at Appendix A should bo ceve3-oped to augment the facilities provided by the rnain airfields and allow of their use by civil transport aircraft. Cl) that a minimum of Uiree foreign instructors be employed, i.e. a pilot instructor, a fitter end rigger and that the following additional foreigr instructors could be usefully employed for 2 or 3 yeai'si- A W/T instructor, » photograpMc instructor and a store keepi. 1 % ins tr uc tor. 3• ingyigstions re^ariinf: the strength and location of _the Air For To# strength of the Air Force will depend largely on the amount of money the loyal Afghan Govt, are prepared to spend in the initial stage on the provision of new aircraft, equipment, airfields, Hangeis etc., and secondly on the sum to be allotted annually for the maintenance of the air Force. It is difficult oo ru;ke concrete suggestions on the most suitable strength for ihe Air Force until the financial side of the problem been decided. larger ^ir Force for example snould normally mean r&gt;ome reduction in tue strength of the regular Army. Judging from conditions as they iiave bttn in Afgh; nistan during the pact 10 years it is suggested uiat tne following organisation might suit tae country:- (a) aeg deuar ter s and Ch ief Airfie ld. Kabul . (i) Air Commandant and small headquarters Staff within the organisation of t^:e Ministry of defence with offices away from the air field. (ii) Station or Airfiald Commandei and - tali.

Transport. -Urcrai c . The recommendations regsrdiug uaassort aircraft for civil and military purposes is that tiie Royal Afghan Govt, begin fcy purchasing 4 to 8 aircraft a* their resources permit, and form a transport flight based in Kabul, inquiries are being made both in dn^Land and India as to the most suitable type for use in Afghanistan. The advantages of forming a transport flight in the Air force are that the aircraft can bsyiaintained economically by service personnel, that tney ars availablfc for use for civil and military purposes, the control being military they can utilise mi Ivyary airfields thus saving the expense of maintaining a separate establishment, that they provide employment for reservist Air Force officers, help to create a reserve of pilots and the cost of maintaining them could be met in part from the budget of the Ministry of Rosts and Telegraphs by which Mnistry they could be used for augmenting their postal and passenger services. C . Establishments and St rength oi Air Force Units etc • T/cdr. B*P. King, the pilot instructor attached to the Royal fghan Air Force, has prepared suggesteu establishments in detail for the Staff of the Air Force, a Station on Airfield H. 2* and Staff, an operational squadron of the *ir Force, and a Training Flight or Squadron of the Air force. These suggested establishments are not necessarily complete though io is considered that they are of sufficient minimum working strength. For instance some sections may need aaditionai personnel In the light of local conditions. Allowance has been made for exparision et a future date, if required, by the single process of doubling. They are therefore submitted as a basis for discussion ana uecision. Thes3 are shown in /.x-Pentices L. c. b* and E respectively. o. LocaUon of AirfleJ.de . (a) tviain Airfields . It is considered that four main airfields would normally be sufficient to meet the country 1 © requirements. Bee Sketch Mop at Appendix A for radius of action of operational aircraft. All efforts sho'ilcl therefore be directed to making the four main airfields serviceable for use throughout the year by constructing at least one run-way per airfield. (i) Kabul - Height 5 . 680* a.s.X. Sherpur airfield could be extended by including the Stadium area, .* nd making a new road S.E. of th. military Club to Bimaru. Alternatively it coulc3 be extended a little to the Aest towards 3naiir-l-Nau. The airfield would then be adequate for most purposes. Khwaja Rawash is suitable ana the airfield can be extended as required. Both airfields racgii^e 9 cement or bithtss run-way. Kabul is wall situs Utd for the h.qrs, of the Air Force, but run-vrays should be constructed which can be kept clear of snow in the winter months.

(5v &gt; BeidO-an - ^anark&lt; Q b.vri and ar ^n - ileridiC B t O OO l a&gt;s&gt;l • No airfield exists but one should be constructed. Its situation N. of the Hindu Kush is of great value and surppsses tiie airfields at Maatr-i-Sharif and Kiisnabad, both too close to the northern frontier. An airfield here would protect the factories, and aircraft could covi-r most of Northern Afghanistan. The site would also be of value for use by civil, transport aircraft. (b) Subsidiary Airfields . There are rrrany suitable sites for airfields throughout the country but expense precludes the nainten^nce of a large number and it is suggested that the following airfields are suitable for use in emergencies and are sufficient to meet the country's requirements (i) Jalalabad - 1950 ( . In use. (ii) dardez - 7.500 , . In use and Katun - 3,800* can also be utilised when required.

Afghanistan is not at present in a post tion to manufacture aircraft or spax*es and must roly on purchases from abroad. It will rot bo possible for Afghanistan to embark on tae mnuf&amp;cture of aircraft for many years to come., and it would be advisable to develop a close liason with some one foreign country for the supply of aircraft and spares, aviation petrol •. na other Air Force equipment, the advanced training of Afghan elr Ff»rce personnel, and the provision of such technic£&lt;l assistance as may be required through the enployment of a limited number of instructors and advisers. Experience has shown that in most small countries where an Air Force of moderate size iicts been created, maintenance of the aircraft purchased has been the weakest poirt. The chief rear one for this tendency are that officers of the country concerned are unwilling to take responsibility foi the repair of aircraft and upkeep of workshops and stores etc., or the Govt, of the country are disinclined to delegate that respon sibility to their own officers because they have to exercise full economy in the allotment of funds. Methods of store-keeping and accounting are frequently antiquated and thia results in a heavy annual loss to the Govt. It is therefore suggested that any foreign instructors employed should be made full uaa of by asking for their suggestions and advice on all uckalnistrativa onestions affecting workshops, upkeep and issue of stores etc., and that thsy should not bd employed solely for training purposes or on the actual repair of aircraft or other technical duties. The advice given by foreign xst advisors should be given careful consideration and if for any reason this advice cannot be accepted they should be informed and the matter discussed frankly with uhem. Foreign advisers or instructors naturally would not wish to interfere in matters of high policy, but would appreciate being given the reasons why their proposals cannot be carried out in order to assist tham in formulating fux’ther suggestions. In the case of the Afghan Ala f orce it is suggested tiiat a comndttee of Afghan offic*!? be appeinted for exiiiidniuig in coa- ,junction with t/Car. B,P. Kin^ tne present system of ordering, receiving, storing, issuing and accounting for spere parts, peti'ol and equipment and making recommend*tione torAr.e introduction of a more up to date typter in tiie Ail Force than at present exists. The Afghan Govt, will save a gre,?t dea^ of . oney If this is done. Useless •und unserviceable spares and equipment should be sold or utilised sphere possible fer nfinufecturing other rtici ai in the Kabul Arsenal. a more econanical method of issuing petrol to flights and squeorons cnoulf be introduced as at present there is a waste due to deterioration in quality while in store and leakages when refuelling aircraft. tVC&amp;r. B.P. King will be able to ougyest. a nuTber of other improvements t*o tna c^-nmittee of Afghan officers which should result in considerable econom*er. and greater efficiency ir the i! ^oree. Regarding the employment ox three British instructors in the Afghan Air Force. It is for tht ccmideration of the Boyal Af^i&amp;nx J ara 7 Contd . tmge 9. r ■7ri iii A AO . Q Govt, as to whether it would not be mfcre economical* io i»v4&gt; the pilot* instructor, the X‘ittex ; arid riggei- brawn rroin British personnel of the h«a.F. in India rather than have the t4o latter brought out from civil firms in ^nglanu. There would be a saving-hn the-cost of passages, replacement of instructors could b# effected more easily ana more quickly, and discipline could be maintained more easily if the instructors are all drawn from the K*A.F. This ^/o^eciure would have the additional advantage of securing a closer liason with the in Inaia ana should, at any time, extra instructors in Vi/T or photography etc. be required for short periods they could probably be supplied without the oalcy experienced in obtaining them from England. The Afghan Air Force would also be able to imbibe through these instructors the methods adopted by the a. . .F. for training and administration. It is not considered that efficient British H.&amp;.F. fitters and riggers are in any way inferior to those supplied by civil finm in England since they are trained or can be trained in the maintenance of almost any type of British aircraft in use and have a far wider practical experience than a civilian can normally obtain. After the war with Japan has ended, a nurber of excellent air instructors should be available from the R.A # F. whereas it will be difficult to secure instructors from civil firms in England unless that, particular firm has supplied aircraft or aircraft engines to the Royal Afguan Govt, in fair numbers. 8. fersonnel in tae Afghan Air or ce . (a/ There are obvious weaknesses at present in the system of recruiting and the terms of service, of officers in the Afghan Air Force. There are too many officers employed on duties which should be perionned by N.C.C^s. or men which results in the lowering of the standard of discipline, anu too many officers are being retained in the service after tneir period of usefulness has expired. The existing system not only results in an unnecessary amount of money being expended on salaries for officers, but the officers themselves become disappointed because their prospects of advanceiment are poor or tney become 'time servers* 1 content to draw their salaries and do the minimum amount of work until they are entitled to a pension. It is suggested that a co:nmittee of senior Afghan officers be appointed to examine the position and make recommendations regarding the following points (ij the elimination from the Air Force of officers who by treason of age or inefficiency are no longer useful officers. (ii) give decisions as to which appointments in the Air Force should be held by officers and which by N.C.Cs. or men. (iii) the px'ovision of civil, police or Army employment for redundant officers in the Air Force. (iv) The revision of scales of pay and staff or flying allowances for officers of the Air Force. Cv) the recruitment of officers for the Air Force from Military Colleges or Schools and their conditions of service. (vi) whether or not it would be possible to introduce a short term engagement of from 5 to 12 years with gratuities for officers of the nir Forc^. (vii/ the system to be adopted in future for the promotion of officers in the Air Force. Cviii) the formation of a reserve of officers for the air Force and their conditions of service.

The two year cor script rom^ll.y ta&gt;.cr by the Army ie of little value to uie nir Focce a?3 It will taJca longer tiian tnis perioa to train aim to perform duties of a. technical nature. The othai ranitfl of the Air Force ehoull therefore b'-j prepared to serve ^.foi periods of from 6 Jcearo and upvarus. recruits flight be obtained frea the Military Schools or a special boys wing foi-ined at the Military School from which othe^ ranks ca: be selected foi' service in die Air Forde. Terms of service should be made attractive and allowances given for technical or other qualifications, but the present tendency of granting officers* cocwrissions to any individual with special qualification!? °uch ret photographer or «»/T operator should be eschewed. A committee of s.erior Afrdirn cffic ra should be convened to hake recommendations regarding U;.e recruitment, conditiens of service, pay end allowance? and promotion etc. of other ninks in the Afghan Air Force. W/Cdr. PKing, thr British pilot instructor, will- be able to edvi^e the committee on the system of recruiting end training etc. of other rani^.s in fores in the ft*A.P. P. Cone 3. nA ion a and p roposed pr ogramsio. It is considered that if tra Royal Afghan Govt, are prepared to c-dopt the recommendations made in the preceding paragraphs they shouiu; succeed over a period of 4 to 6 yearc in producing for them selves a small but r^sombly efficient Ajr Force capable of carrying out Mts O'wi* Initial ilying end other preliminary training in ilibul, of carrying out efiiciently such operations as may be necessary for uiviii.lining internal security, of providing a SiiAll civil and iiuliiary aix transport service within the com try and possibly linking up with external air mil services and able to Maintain its aircraft with tne minimum amount of help fiom abroad ana the empicymerit of onJ.y three or four foreign instructors. The fin-ncial aspect of the proolem of placing the - ir Force on a new footing will probtfcly entail a great deal, of tfaoughffcnd necessitate ^Jbe introduction of reiorms by stages, eince the Govt, will have to face the initial cost cf new aircraft and ecuipment as v'ell nr the recurring anrual cost, of the upkeep of the Air Force. The stages for carrying cut the reorganisation alight, it If suggested, be as followTi- Ca) Yeay . (1) the recruitment of new and young officers and other ranks for training in the Air Force.
