Nothing is known of his life. That he is sometimes referred to as Sanensis suggests that he may have come from Sayn, Germany. Arithmetice Lilium Triplicis Practice (The threefold lily of practical arithmetic) presents basic arithmetic operations such as addition and multiplication for whole numbers and fractions. It treats much of the same material that Huswirth had covered in an earlier work, Enchirdion Algorismi (Handbook of algorithms). The work includes two woodcut illustrations; one of God the Father and Jesus Christ surrounded by angels, in the style of Lucas Cranach (1472â€“1553), the other of the coat of arms of Cologne framed by the figures of a lion and a griffin. The volume was published in Cologne in 1511 by the shop of Cornelis of Zyrickzee.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Germany</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Cologne</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/qnlhc/10683#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
