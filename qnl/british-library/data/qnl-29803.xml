B. Finances, Revenues and Taxes. (6) Batna Sheikh’s refusal to pay Zakat. From To Previous number.SECKET EXPRESS LETTER* Erom - She Pd lit leal Agent 9 Muscat* To - The Hon’ble tiie Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire* Ho* C/209. Bated 7th November 1933* Reference my Express Letter No.C/208 dated 5th November 1933* 1 returned to Sohar late on the night ef 5/6th instant having completed the mar Icing out ef the Shinas landing ground with Plying Officer Sloan. Arrangements have been made for the marks to be made durable for per manent use and the landing ground cleared and levelled* This work is already in hand and it is hoped that the area will be ready for use in U 15-20 days* 2. The flying boat expected from Muscat arrived at 10.00 hrs and created a visible impression on the local inhabitants who crowded to the foreshore to view it closely* 3. At my request the flying boat on its return journey circled over one of the more recalcitrant areas ten miles south of Sohar* 4. This, coupled with the facts that Saiyid Hamad has been seen accompanying the M British Consul 1 * to Shinas, that an '*aerodrome ,, was marked out and that Shinas was visited by a flying boat the same day, has had, in my opinion, a most desirable effect* The flying boat* s visit was further enhanced by the fact that a member of the Muscat Council and another member from the Ruling family, were incidentally, and at my request, on board* 5* Buring my absence from Sohar the Consular Bragoman had been engaged in making quiet enquiries from- 2 - various sources as t o the amount of revenue that riad actually heen collected. 6. As a result of these enquiries it transpires that at any rate 20,000 dollars, if not more, have been collected. It remains to be seen if this amount is credited into the Treasury. 7 # It is significant to note that whereas preriouslj R.S.Uuli Chand had told m distinctly that only ^ 16,000 zakat had been collected, on my return journey through Khaburah he informed me that the amount was &amp; 20,000. 8. Although a number of Sheikhs hare undoubtedly refused to pay their zakat, the possibility has to be considered of this fact being used to account for any short payments into the Treasury by the two individuals, Saiyid Hamid and Rai Sahib Duli Chand, now engaged on tax gathering. Whilst at present there is nothing tangible to establish such a suspicion, the necessary ingredients are all present and the character of the two tax gatherers is not such as to place them beyond that suspicion. 9 # Although Saiyid Hamid has submitted a written report to the Council I have not so far received from them any request for advice or assistance. I learn un officially that they are devided in# their opinions, which on the whole tend to a policy of laisser-fairo. 10. Taking all things into consideration I am of the opinion that any threat or demonstration a t the pre sent juncture would not only be unsuitable but unsuccess ful in obtaining the desired results. H # it would however be of immense value in view of possible eventualities to have the strip of coast between Sohar and Khaburah photographed from the air in a con nected mosaic and I would strongly advocate that this be done at the earliest opportunity. Such a map, collated with ground information, would permit of swift action should the situation later demand drastic measures.12. I am of tiie ©pinion that the present revenue system leaves much to be desired and needs complete revision at a very early date by a competent and qualified British Officer. It appears to leave many unnecessary loop- c ho$es for peculation and whilst the poor pay,the strong refuse payment with impunity, to the very great detriment of the State. 13. In the meanwhile the situation is being care fully watched and all developments will be immediately reported to you. Major, Political Agent &amp; H.B.M 1 s Consul, Muscat.Tulsidas Thurdas c gent of Narsingdc&gt;s Khushaldas, Hindu merchant, eta tea that when he enquired from llr. Dulichond who wae his guest for a few dc ye &lt;t Sohar ^ hout the 2; ki t he informed him that though they expected to collect $ 30000 they were able to collect kees than that i mount• Tulsidas thinks that if the amount collected is less than 30000 it should be over $ 20000/-. He has not heard anything about the refuse 1 of the Sheikhs to p;. y the Zakat and Mr. Dulichend did not mention the matter to him. Bhawandas Okartn, agent of Pursotam /.soo, states that as far as he knows when Saiyid Hamad went to Shinas the Sheikhs refused to see him and pay the Zakat. He returned to Sohar and sent the Wali who interviewed and persuaded the Sheikhs to pay the Zakat. The Sheikhs came to Sohar and paid if not the whole at least half of the amount which was due from them. He does not know the actual mount of Zakat collected but Shinoon, Customs Askari has taken from him an empty box which e- n take $ 16000/-. Shinoon, Customs \skari, states that • sum of # 27000/- has been collected until now. / 12000 was remitted before to Muscat and £ 15000 will be taken by him in a dhow to Muscat. He saia that almost all the Sheikhs of Shamailiyah have paid their Zakat and the only Sheikhs who refused to pay (re those who are living in villages between 3?ham and Khaburah.(V.

I feel sure that Your Highness 1 visit to Dhofar and your expedition to the Q,ara mountains will do much to consolidate Your Highness* influence in those parts. Colonel Fowle, who is now back, has 'written to Your Highness on the Batinah situation, ./hi 1st the situation is far from satisfactory, 1 am in no ,ay convinced that the facts ar e a_s__ they have been represented to me , and probably to Your Highness. 1 have heard a considerable amount from all sides - both during my repid tour to 'Shinas - and otnerwise - and 1 will tell you all and offer lour Highness my views when we meet. One thing is very certain and that is that the situation will need Your Highness own personal and very careful investigation. For the time being all is quiet but the situation needs watching and no hasty conclusions should be jumped to. insha*llah opportunity will soon afford for us to meet and discuss everything and if I can be of help to Your Highness I shall do my best to that end. i am most grateful to Your Highness for your invi tation to come to Dhofar to discuss the Murbat reconnaissance. This will be far the most effective way of working out the necessary arrangements which require careful forethought and attention. 1 an: applying telegraphically for the use of a flying boat but it will not be possible to come this month and between 9th and 12th December 1 must be here to receive K.M.S.'Colombo” which is on a visit to the Gulf.

It will take some time before I get news but directly 1 do so I will inform four Highness. ■He have had very early rains this year in Husca t and all along the Coast which will help the wells.

Oman Government, ruse A T. After compliments, I have the honour to report that I returned, hack on 12 th instant from the tour in Batinah undertaken under your orders in company with Saiyid Hamad 'bin raisal in connection with the collection of Zakat. The tour took as much as 49 days from 25th September to 12th November, 1933. About Dollars 25,000 have been collected and taking the colections into account the tour has been successful. Saiyid Hamad has been very heluful. It is more due to his tact and experience that I have been able to settle up many complicated (questions other than Zakat such as completion of buildingaand repairs of offices,collection of BOat registration fees,shop tax and Hawari tax etc. His help has been invaluable in effecting improved co-operation between the Customs,the wali and the people. I wish to put on record my high sense of appreciation for saiyid Hamad bin Faisal’s assistance to this department. I will give in brief under each station the position of Zakat collections. Sib . At Sib all the important Shaikhs came to interview S. Hamad bin Faisal. Exeept for Awamir and yal Hadid and the inhabitants of Jfanuma, the payment made were about 2/3 of the actual demands. Awamir were arrested and brought to Fuscat. Shaikh Saif bin Said El-Hadidi was absent from the village and the shaikh of Fanuma said bin Abdullah showed his inability to pay for most of Zakat was payable by thethe inhahitants of Suyi«avine their gardens in the place. Dollars 600/- have heen collected from Awamir. The oalance o_ last year 1551 Zakat still outstanding is about Dollars 500/- only. The total Zakat collected for the year is over half Ox the demands. Birka . just like Sih, at Birka also all the important shaikhs came in. The A1 Bukman who did not satisfactorily account fox their Zakat were put under arrest and oly released after a month on giving satisfactory guarantees for payment. Yal ^adr which has two sections one under Filal bin Hamad and the other under Khamis who was appointed in place of Shaikh Yashin bin Hamad is the important Badu tribe of the district. Hilal bin Hamad bolted away. He was removed from shaikhdom. A boy frcm the house of shaikh with two other shaikhs acting as regent was made Shaikh and guarantee taken from all with shaikh El the Sultan bin Bhamis bin Hasani for payment of/total zakat due from Hilal bin Hamad's section within a period of two months. Burthen the Baluch and Ajam were separated from the eakat Yal Badr and made directly responsible for payment of their zakat. They paid the zakat in full. The Hawalik and the other tribes have in most cases paid about half of their zakat. The total zakat collected for the year came to about half of the total demands. Last year's balance still outstanding is about Dollars 2,000/- out of the total zakat of about 11 , 000 /-. yusana. At Husana, there is no zakat. The question of brok erage tax at Wadam was satisfactorily settled. SuwaicL. At SuwaicL Shaikh Hilal bin Hamad A1 Sa'di came in wit with a large contingent of about 150 armed men. The question of brokerage tax at Fhadhra was satisfactorily settled. The zakat payable by the inhabitants in the district other than A1 Saad which has been in dispute on account of mishandlingA 3. “by an unexperienced Tali Filal i)in H^hammad was then discussed, Shaikh Hilal bin Hamad was informed that this zakat /as being 3 paid since over tMm years direct to the Tali and the same arrangement should continue till His Highness the Sultan .as hack and any allowance paid to you by ^will^he con tinued. He has-been given to understand^that the Government wanted to take this xakat and will gradually start collections from the yal Saad too. This idea fresh in IT s mind made all arguments put before him fruitless. This question was hov/ever left pending. 1 would suggest that Sh. Hilal should be called in to Muscat and asked to pay up this zakat and the Wali who has been cause of it should be shifted from the pl-;.ce. Khaboora. At Khaboora, the Hawasanas do not pay zakat. The tola 1 zakat from thia district other than the Hawasanas carnet to ore 1 ^ 2000 /- only. Sheikh sultan bin Saif binMuhammad a promising young Shiekh of the important tribe of the Hawasana came and met us at Khaboora. He was deputed to advise the SIamis and Khaldis to pay up their zakat. Most of other Shiekhs came in. The Al ^atiti took time within which to pay. The collec tions in all have been little more than 1/3 of the demands. Hamad bin *ilal the wali has not been very tactful and although spoke highly of his qualities has not been so helpful. Similarly the useless wali of &lt;&lt;,asbiya Said bin Saif. Saham . Shiekh Ghusan bin ^alim of Beni Cmar was sent to Bil, Majasa £ Mukhalif to advise the Sheikhs in the fertile tract be tween Khaboora &amp; Saham from Q,asbiya to Mukhalif who have been avoiding payment since last year and refused to nx come in. The important one of them is Sheikh Abdulla’ bin Mattar who flew during His Highness tour and when brought was released on guarantee for payment of zakat by Sheikh Ohussan bin Halim. The mission of Sheikh Ghussan whose dealing arenot without suspicion failed. The wali of Sahar saood 'bin Ali was then asked to advise them, in a reply to his letter they agreed to come in, but before the arrival of day fixed, changed their mind, saood hin *li and Sheikh u-ussan were again sent and the final reply from them was no-payment of zakat, non arrivd .1 to interview and discuss and refusal even the payment of seme of customs duties on goods shipped and brought to their place. Their flat retfTusal bad bad effect on seme of x^hahoora people &amp; the Shumaliyah. if no action is taken to make them submissive the result will be non payment of all kind of taxes including zakat not only in this tract but throughout the -^atna coast. This will mean less of the about 1/3 of the total revenues of the state . The balance of zakat due from them for the years 1932 &amp; 1933 is about ^ 8000/- Sxcept for them and sheikh '-'aid bin Hawaishal of Abul- dharos who also followed their example, the remaining Sheikhs came and paid most of their zakat. The collection from the district were about 1/4 of the demands. Sahar . No difficulty was experienced and zakat collected came to about 1/2 of the demands issued. Liwa. Except for the Sheikh Ilusabah bin Khalfan of Ghazfan &amp; Ali bin Sulaiman Al-Kamari of dad the collections made v/ere satisfactory and came to over 1/2 of the demands issued. Shinas, Between Liwa &amp; Shinas is a very fertile tract inhabited by some of the important Sheikhs of Northern part of tbe country. The portion is known as Asrar and each division of it is followed by the name of the tribe inhabiting it. There are two customs posts in this part . One at Husaifein (Bur el Baloch) and the other at Shinas. Before our arrival there has been trouble between the wali of Shinas Sh. Lansur bin Ghalib and Sh. Hamad 'bin Salim el Fazrui, in which rifle shots were fired on the mli and government Askaris were heaten hy sticks. Although Sheikg5 /■\ liutiairmiad el Riasi liad come to ask pardon on deiiair of sheikh Hamad t&gt;in t&gt;alxm, tiie situation in tne place was not calm. There have 'been misunderstanding due to hasty actions of Hamad tin Hilal ex wali who has .given some of the sheikhs promises for remission of their zakat without previous sanction of the Government. A Badu is very hard business man. He wrangles and argues when in possession of any document. Generally he is the winner of the bargain &amp; so some of these Sheikhs rightly disputed their cases. Sh. Abdulla bin Muhammad Al Hamuda of -aqr v/ith sheikh Jfijhammad bin 'asir and Ali bin Abdulla Al Tawil of Abubaqra have come to see us at niwa. They were given hearty welcome and permission to go back and arrange collection of zakat as far as possible. The Sheikhs of -asrar between Liwa and shin as were \\AMSL, invited to see us at niwa but haare responded except a small one Sh. Khalfan bin Hamid of Khadrawin who was also permitted to go and arrange collection and meet us at shinas but failed to respond. We were 5 days at Shinas hoping that the situation may change but none of the sheikhs either came or paid his portion of zakat. Our party then proceeded to Abubaqra where Sheikh ¥uhammad bin Sulaiman an agent of wali Saood bin A li who was sent by the wali to advise the Sheikhs came and met us. He informed us about their ideas and was allowed to inform them about the three conditions Viz:- (1) Arrears of last year zakat should be paid in full. ( 2 ) l/ 3 rd of this year zakat should be paid and the balance paid within the time agreed. (3) The Sheikhs should come in person &amp; see S. Hamad bin Faisal as a mark of obedience to the Govt. Sh. Huhammad bin Sulaiman's mission was however not successful. The Sheikhs finding us weak &amp; bargaining put up their own terms which were neither logical not reasonable. At Abubaqra Sh. Muhammad el RtwCsi with Sh. Hamad binbalim el Mazrui tJie accused in tne wall of* ahinas snooting case met us. The Sheikh was pardoned as a political move and permitted to go and collect zakat i*rom his men &amp; p&amp;y» We were the guests oi* the two important sheikhs at Ahu- Baora who though entertained us well did not pay a reasonable sum. They were asked that they should at least pay up nali and meet us on our return at Shinas or Liwa.They also failed to fulfil their promise and were not seen. Sheikh Abdulla bin Kuhammad Al-Hamuda the important Sheikh of Aq^r with good followin ng had also come, ne had invited our party for luncheon and was requesting Saiyid Hamad bin Haisal to pardon Shaikh Abdullah oin Fuhammad A1 Barman who has been avoiding to meet Government representative since two years ano. vas considered to be disloyal. Saiyid a Shaikh Hamad promised A1 Hamuda and asked them to see us at Baqra v/ith as much money as they had collected.Al Hamuda left and did not return. On our return he came before the car req uesting to get down at his place Dut we passed on to Shinas,thus Al Hamuda also turned tail. We had been to iruralr,the shaikh of which place though twice came to see us failed to pay the required quota of zakat and at the last moment did not respond to meet us at Shinas whenjrf called for. With such situation we turned back to Sahar after a day*s interval at Liwa. It was then proposed to make a final effort to send w a ii saood bin Ali to advise the Shumailiyah shaikhs and warn them of the consequences. In the meantime news of beatimg the Husaifin Customs wamur by Shaikh Abdullah bin Ali bin Barwish were received and the wall asked to investigate. Wali saood bin Ali came back with promise of improvement as some of the shaikhs has agreed to come and pay a substahtative part of zak^t. About Boilers 2 , 000 /- were paid in and few of the important shaikhs came to Sahar. The important of them Al Barman and Al Hamuda keeping back. The opportunity of the shaikh's presence was well availed,their accounts were settled and they apparently left in good mood but bfeore they were out from Sahar a letter was rec eived from shaikh Asrar Abdullah bin Saif and Fuhammad bin'bin returning frem back the kashfas(statements) and contrad icting what they had agreed. This is stated to he again Shaikh Qhusn hin Salim of Bani Umar playing about. oJC I may add here that according to the iirijortayt obtained the zakat has been collected in full by the Shaikhs from their men and thus money due is in the hands of shaikhs and not their people, It may also be Interesting to keep on record that the zakat assesssment in this area are less thaib what they were paying in pre-assessment time. Further the sheep tax collected from the place wOA also remitted by His Highness and shaikhs were given special remissions last year and hf 0 general remi ssion this year. They have no cause to complain about the so called excessive assessment etc. It is for the Government now to devise what action should be taken. As for Finance is concerned,it should be considered the beginning of a coming heavy loss of revenue and its effect on the next year’s budget would be preearious.
