Despite the apparently secular nature of the subject, and the fact that the camp does not depict a stopping-off point on the hadj, the laudatory poetry and prose makes clear the relevance of the image to the experience of the hadj – that is, that the Turks, as ‘military people of the highest rank’ serve Islam by defending and enabling the passage to Mecca and Medina for other Muslims.As with the other photographs in this album (Photo 174/1-13), whose subjects are architectural and landscape, the figures are not the subject of the image. However, a detailed examination of the image shows the soldiers going about their day-to-day activities, such as cooking and eating. The method by which the ground would have been prepared before a tent was erected is indicated by the empty low circular foundation in the lower left corner of the image. In the distance, in the right-hand background of the image, beyond the dry-stone wall delineating the camp, palm groves and permanent dwellings can be identified.InscriptionsRecto:Upper centre: 'Picture of the Tents of the Turks'To the right and left of the title:'These are the true men of God, the fighters for God's religion;These are the Turks who sacrificed their lives for the path of the chosen one [i.e., Muhammad]Friends, these are the tents of the warriors of the faith;These are the lions of God, the sincere upholders of the faith.'To the right and left of the image:'The people, the accounts of whose bravery have filled the pages of world history; the people – each drop of blood that was extracted from every individual and made into a gem of bravery and heroism; the people who made even their enemies utter, "Truly in the entire world, these are a military people of the highest rank"; the people who amongst themselves are a people of the highest degree of kindheartedness and hospitality; the people who in their religious ardour are always ready to sacrifice their life; who are those people? Those people, those blessed people, are these very Turks. They are the self-sacrificing people who, since the time they accepted the blessing of Islam, have served it with spiritual and material commitment, without the slightest hesitation. These are the blessed tents of these people which remain standing in an orderly manner in Medina the Radiant.'Lower centre: 'H. A.
