Other methods included incising designs with pointed objects, polishing the surface with a cloth, or using a stone to burnish it, creating an attractive sheen. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPainted decorations appear on pottery throughout the Eighteenth Dynasty. Early designs included thin lines and long pendant triangles. Around the time of Thutmose III, artists invented a pastel blue paint that eventually dominated pottery decoration. A rare type of pot made exclusively for tombs was painted to reproduce the appearance of stones such as breccia. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter decorating the vessel, the potter placed it in a kiln for firing. Potters wrapped cords around large unfired vessels to prevent them from collapsing. These ropes burned away during firing, but traces of them remain on the sides of some pots.<br />", "summary": "", "rank": 0, "label_date": "2016-03-01", "date_added": "2016-04-04 21:03:52", "approved_for_web": 1}], "artists": [], "collections": [{"id": 5, "name": "Egyptian, Classical, Ancient Near Eastern Art", "folder": "egyptian", "rank": 0}], "exhibitions": [{"id": 648, "title": "Egypt Reborn: Art for Eternity"}, {"id": 3329, "title": "Ancient Egyptian Art"}], "related_items": [{"accession_number": "07.447.459", "object_id": 4215}, {"accession_number": "16.580.128", "object_id": 3180}], "geographical_locations": [{"id": 6863634, "name": "Egypt", "type": "Place made"}], "videos": [], "images": [{"filename": "CUR.16.580.129_erg456.jpg", "id": 81018, "standard_size_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size2/CUR.16.580.129_erg456.jpg", "thumbnail_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size0_sq/CUR.16.580.129_erg456.jpg", "derivatives": [{"size": "0", "width": 72, "height": 96}, {"size": "1", "width": 144, "height": 192}, {"size": "2", "width": 288, "height": 384}, {"size": "3", "width": 576, "height": 768}, {"size": "4", "width": 1152, "height": 1536}], "largest_derivative_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size4/CUR.16.580.129_erg456.jpg", "largest_derivative": "4", "description": null, "caption": " <em>Blue-painted Storage Jar</em>, ca. 1332-1292 B.C.E.
