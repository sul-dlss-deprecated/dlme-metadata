June 1906. CONFIDENTIAL. (8658.) Memorandum respecting the Bagdad Railway. [Amended Version. See Fart IV, p. 17.] THE subject of this Memorandum is dealt with under five headings:— 1. General Railway development in Asia Minor. 2. The Bagdad Railway Convention of 1903. 3. The Anglo-German negotiations of 1903. 4. The prospects of completion of the line without British co-operation. 5. The influence of the railway on British interests. In the first and second parts recourse has been had, both for purposes of reference and quotation, to two works in particular—“ Le Chemin de Fer de Bagdad,” by Cheradame, and “The Middle Eastern Question,” by Chirol. The statements of these writers have, however, been verified by official Reports, and where inaccurate care fully corrected. Part 3 is a summary of official correspondence. Part 4 is based upon (a) the Report for 1904- 1905 of the Ottoman Debt Administration, and (6) statistics respecting the yield, actual and estimated, of revenues available for allocation to the kilometric guarantees. Part 5 is a precis of Memoranda prepared at the Committee of Imperial Defence, the War Office, and the Board of Trade, and of official correspondence. Three Appendices are annexed, containing respectively a railway map of Asiatic Turkey, the text of the Bagdad Railway Convention of 1903, and a list of official documents and published works to which reference has been made.General Railway Development in Asia Minor up to 1903.* The Anatolian Railway Company. (Scutari to Konia, 1,032 kilom., or 615 miles, including Angora line.) The first section of this line, from Scutari to Ismidt (91 kilom.), was originally built to the order of the Turkish Government, under the direction of a German engineer, Yon Plessel. It was completed in 1873. The Ottoman autho rities soon found it difficult to work, and in 1880 granted it as a Concession to an English Com pany for twenty years. They had, however, reserved the right to determine the Concession at any date, and they exercised it in October 1888 in favour of M. Kaulla, a German. At the same time this gentleman received a Concession for ninety-nine years for a line from Ismidt to Angora, a distance of 487 kilom., with a kilometric guarantee of 15,000 fr., while the guarantee for the section from Scutari to Ismidt was fixed at 10,300 fr. per kilometre. M. Kaulla was acting on behalf of the Deutsche Bank and the Wiirtembergiscke Vereinsbank. On the 16th March, 1889, these two institutions founded the Ottoman Company of Anatolian Railways. Practically the whole capital of the new Company was subscribed in Germany. The line to Angora began to work in 1893. In February of the same year two further Concessions were granted to the Anatolian Com pany :— 1. Por an extension of the line from Eski- chehir (a point about midway between Ismidt and Angora) to Konia, a distance of 445J kilom., with a guarantee of nearly 14,000 fr. per kilom.; and 2. Por a line from Angora to Kaiserieh, with an eventual extension to Bagdad via Sivas and Diabekir. The Company found, in the light of further investigation, that the line from Angora to * Vide “ Stock Exchange Official Intelligence,” 1906.Kaiserieh would not prove remunerative, and it was consequently abandoned. The section to Konia was opened to traffic in 1896. The total mileage of the Anatolian Companv at this time was 645, made up as follows :— Scutari to Ism idt Miles. .. 57 Ismidt to Angora # # .. 304 Eskichehir to Konia # # 279 Branch Line .. .. 5 Total .. .. 645 The Managing Director of the railway was at first M. von Kuhlman, who was afterwards succeeded by M. Zander. The Chief Engineer was M. von Kapp. Before enumerating the further stages of the Turco-German negotiations in regard to railway development, it will be convenient to describe briefly other lines in Asiatic Turkey which are only partially under German influence, or entirely independent. The Smyrna-Cassaba Railway Company. (Total length, with extension to Afioun-Kara- hissar and branches, 518 kilom., or 324 miles.) The Smyrna-Cassaba Railway Concession was granted in 1863 to Mr. E. Price, who transferred his rights to a British Company. In 1872 an extension of 75 kilom., from Cassaba to Ala- chehir, was sanctioned. In 1893 the Ottoman Government exercised the right of repurchase, and transferred the line to M. Georges Nagelmackers (Director of the International Sleeping Car Company), granting him at the same time an extension to Afioun- Karahissar. In the following year, M. Nagelmackers transferred the line to the Societe Nouvelle des Chemins de Per Smyrne-Cassaba et Prolonge- ment, with its head-quarters at Paris. The Company was thus placed more or less under French influence. Afioun-Karahissar was, however, already served by the Anatolian Railway, and it was obvious that if a junction were effected much of the4 traffic destined for shipment to Europe would be diverted from Constantinople (483 kilom.) to the more convenient port of Smyrna (420 kilom.). The German Company fully realized the danger, and the two lines remained separated by a few yards. Negotiations were at length begun between the two Companies, and resulted in an arrangement by which two French representatives were admitted to the Board of the Anatolian Bail- way and two Germans to that of the Smyrna- Cassaha Company. The Deutsche Bank had meanwhile purchased shares in the latter Com pany, and now possesses a majority of the total issue, and consequently a casting vote. When this arrangement was concluded (in 1899) the Porte at once removed its veto on the junction of the two lines at Afioun-Karahissar, and it was effected in 1901.* Dr. Rohrbach, in his'book “ Die Bagdadbahn,” published in Berlin in 1902, expresses the view that the line to Smyrna should in reality be looked upon as the first section of the Bagdad Railway. The Smyrna-Aidin Railway Company. (Total length 516 kilom., or 322 miles, including 2 miles leased and worked.) The oldest Railway Concession in Asia-Minor is that which was granted to the Smyrna-Aidin Company in September 1856. The railway now consists of a main line from Smyrna to Dineir, vi&amp; Aidin, 376 kilom. (235 miles) in length, and of seven branch lines, 140 kilom. (87 miles) in length. In 1891 the Company applied for a Concession to prolong the line from Dineir to Konia. They were unsuccessful on this, as on a subsequent occasion (in 1901). The refusal of the Porte was, in the circum stances, most natural. The Aidin line possessed no kilometric guarantee. On the other hand, the Cassaba extension, from Alach^hir to Afioun- Karahissar, had a guarantee of 18,900 fr. per kilometre. It was in the interest of the Turkish Government to diminish this guarantee by in creasing the trafiSc as rapidly as possible. * But apparently now the two lines are no lonerer ioined (March 1906) JSir N. O’Conor, No. 276, April 24, 1906. A The Mersina-Tarsus and Adana Railway Company (Limited). (Total length 67 kilom., or 42 miles.) This Company is under the management of an Anglo-French Board, which sits at Constan tinople. The President is Mr. E. Pears. The Concession includes mining, quarrying, and forestry rights, as well as immunity from taxation, and is for fifty years from January 1883. The railway then reverts, subject to pay ment for rolling-stock, &amp;c., to the Ottoman Government, who may, however, by arrangement with the Company, determine the duration of the Concession at any date after 1912. Much official correspondence, terminating with Mr. de Bunsen’s despatch No. 146, Commercial, of the 9th October, took place during 1900 on the subject of the fears entertained by the Mersina- Adana Company that the extension of the Bagdad Railway into their country, with access to a port ' on the Gulf of Alexandretta, would seriously injure their interests. In December 1905 Baron de Vendeuvre, the Vice-Chairman of the Company, left Constanti nople for Berlin, where, after several interviews with Dr. Zander and Herr Gwinner, acting on behalf of the Anatolian Railway Company and Deutsche Bank respectively, he came to an arrangement by which he undertook to place those Companies jointly in possession of a sufficient number of ordinary and preference shares of the Mersina Railway to command a majority of votes at general meetings of the Company. The German group now control about 1,440 to 1,450 votes out of a total of 2,807. jyir. Pears and Sir W. M hittall remain on the Board. * Mersina is not a convenient terminus for a great railway ; it possesses no harbour, and the roadstead is much exposed. [581] C © 36 Part II. The Bagdad Railway Convention of March 1903. The earlier phases of the negotiations between the Porte and the Anatolian Company are now of little more than historical interest, as the original Agreements underwent repeated and far-reaching modification, and were eventually superseded by two documents, the Bagdad Railway Convention and the Statutes of the Socidte Impdriale du Chemin de Per de Bagdad, both dated the 5th March, 1903. (See Appendix.) The original plan had been to carry on the trans-continental line, not from Konia, but from Angora, the northern extension of the Anatolian Railway system, through Sivas and Diarbekir to the Tigris. The Ottoman Government had from the first strongly favoured this plan, as it pre sented great strategical advantages. This view was throughly appreciated by the Russian Gov ernment, who, as a measure of self-defence, concluded a Convention with the Porte, generally known as the “ Black Sea Basin Agreement,” in March 1900, which practically rendered im possible all railway construction in northern Asia Minor, unless under Russian auspices. The Anatolian Company, partly no doubt on political, but mainly on commercial grounds, decided to reject the northern route in favour of the southern one. Ihe text of the Convention will be found in the Appendix. The following are the main features of the Pinal Concession, as summarized in Mr. Chirol’s “ Middle Eastern Question ”:— From Konia the first section of the railway, which was opened to traffic in October 1904, presented no serious difficulties. It continues to run so far over the Anatolian Plateau at an altitude of about 3,000 feet. After reaching Eregli, however, it is immediately con fronted by the Taurus Mountains. Advantage is to be taken of the Chakit Su canon, and then the railway will cross the small and fertile plain of Adana before scaling the second, but less formidable rampart, which falls away in easier slopes towards the basin of the Euphrates and Tigris. “ 1 he two sectl0ns horn Eregli to Adana, and from Adana to Tell-Habesh, where the branch line will■'erge to Aleppo and Northern Syria, will certainly prove the most costly and difficult portion of the f“ lre ’ as tlje . y ' vil1 necessitate altogether nearly 00 miles of blasting and tunnelling. After emerging rom the Taurus Mountains the line, instead of sweeping round the foothills through the fairly populous and fertile districts of Urfa and Diarbekir into the upper valley of the Tigris and down to Mosul, is to be earned m a straight line across the desert, between the twin rivers of Mesopotamia to Mosul, and thence down the desolate right bank of the Tigris to Bagdad. It is true that a feeder is to be thrown out at Urfa, and others are contemplated later on to Marash, Aintab, Birejik, Mardin, Erbil, and to Tuzkurmatli and Salahieh m the Kerkuk district. But the proposed route for the main line would hardly have been adopted by the Company, had not the kilometric guarantee rendered it financially independent of the immediate resources of the country to be traversed between the Taurus and Bagdad. £ rom Bagdad a very important branch is to go oft' to the Persian frontier at Khanikin, whence one of the chief trade routes into Persia lies through Kermanshah and Hamadan to Tehran. The annual value of the British trade carried on with Persia by this route (l‘.)02) is estimated at 750,000/.—a fact which serves inci dentally to illustrate the many-sided bearings of the Bagdad Railway upon British interests. From Bagdad the main line is to trend back to the Euphrates, and cross it again in order to touch at the two sacred cities of the Shiah Mussulmans, Kerbela and Nedjef, where the mere pilgrim traffic from Persia and from India will prove a considerable source of revenue, on the way down to Bussorah, the chief port of the Shatt- el-Aiab, and to its appointed terminus, wherever that may ultimately be, on the Persian Gulf. The barest preliminary surveys have, however, yet been made of the Mesopotamian sections of the railway, which will certainly present some rather serious difficulties, owing to the intricate network of swamps and marshes that cover so large a portion of the great fluvial delta. 1 he total length of the new railway, including the branches, for the construction of which immediate provision is made, is not set down anywhere in the Convention, even approximately, though, in view of the kilometric guarantee to which the Turkish Govern ment is pledged, it would seem to be a very material point. It may be estimated, roughly, at 1,750 miles, and if 638 miles be added for the existing Anatolian Railway s, and for the Smyrna—Cassaba and Mersina— Adana Railways, which have already passed under German control, another 400 miles, the entire system will amount to an aggregate of nearly 2,800 miles. “ The Concession is granted (Article II) for ninety- nine years, but in reality it will extend over a slight! v longer period. For the ninety-nine years’ term will run for each of the sections, into which the line is tobe divided, from the date when the State bonds to be issued by the Ottoman Government are handed over in respect of it. The Anatolian Railways Concession, which was originally for a similar term of ninety-nine vears, from 1888, is at the same time extended so as to cover the full period ot the new Company s Con cession. “ The new line is to be divided up for purposes ot construction into sections, each of approximately 200 kilom. (Article III). These sections are not specified, but it is understood that, starting from Konia, the main line will comprise twelve sections, viz., Konia-Eregli (opened in 1004), Eregli-Adana, Adana-Tellhabesh (whence the branch line to Aleppo), Tellhabesh-Harran (whence the branch line to Urfa), Harran-Nussibin Nussibin-Mosul, Mosul-Tekrit, lek- rit-Bagdad (with a branch line Irom Sadijeh to Khanikin, on the Persian frontier), Bagdad-Nedjel, Nedjef-Zubeir, and Bashar (two sections), and finally Zubeir to the Persian Gulf. “ Article IV binds the concessionnaire to begin work on the first section within three months from approval of the plans, and to complete it within two years. [It was actually completed in October 1904.] At the same time it is provided that the whole line and its branches shall be completed within eight years, a curiously short allowance for the completion of the other sections when compared with the two years allowed for completion of the first section alone. But this Article contains another still more curious provision. The term fixed for the completion of the whole line is subject not only to the punctual fulfilment by the Ottoman Government of its financial obligations towards the concessionnaire, but also to delays arising from force majeure; and force majeure includes, as well as war between European Powers, any radical change in the financial situation of Germany, Great Britain, or France. As there is nothing to indicate what shall be deemed to constitute such a radical change, nor who shall determine when such a radical change shall be held to have taken place, this provision appears liable to very elastic construction. “ The railway is to be built (Article VII) in the first instance for a single line, but a second line is to be laid when the gross kilometric receipts shall have reached 30,000 fr. per annum. “Article VIII provides for the creation of an Ottoman Joint Stock Company under the name of “ Imperial Ottoman Bagdad Railway Company,” which shall aiKe the place of the Anatolian Railway Company in all that concerns the new line from Konia to the Persian Gulf with its branches. The Anatolian Company engages not to transfer its lines to any other than the Imperial Ottoman Bagdad Railway Company, and the latter binds itself not to part with its property in any shape or form. “ Article IX allows the Company during constructionto acquire and use steam and sailing vessels and other craft on the Shatt-el-Arab, the Tigris, and the Euphrates, for the transport of materials and other requirements. Considering how jealous the Turkish Government is of all navigation rights on those water ways, this clause, even with the restrictions attached to the permission, is of conside rable significance, for when the Company has once acquired the plant necessary for navigating those waters, and established the wharves and warehouses it is entitled, under another Article of the Concession, to construct at Bagdad and Bussorah, it is improbable that it will consent to relinquish the advantages of navigation. “ Article XII opens up the way for an almost indefinite extension of the new Company’s control of the railways, not merely of Asia Minor and Meso potamia, but of Syria and Northern Arabia. Whilst professing to safeguard the rights of the Damascus- Hamah Railway Company, a French Company at present, it secures to the Bagdad Railway Company prior rights for the construction ot any branch con necting it with the Mediterranean between Mersina and Tripoli in Syria. The Bagdad Railway Company is thus brought into contact with the Syrian railway system, which is made up at present of several small lines which would therefore seem bound to pass ulti mately under the control of their powerful neighbour, and eventually, with the line which the Sultan is engaged in building from Damascus to Mecca, via Mezarib. “ Article XXIII gives the Company the right to establish ports on the Tigris at Bagdad, on the Shatt- el-Arab at Bussorah, and at the terminal point on the Persian Gulf. With the powers conferred upon it the Company, as the owner of the wharves, quays, ware houses, &amp;c., which it is authorized to construct, must inevitably acquire complete control of the traffic by water as well as by land. Mention may also be made in this connection of Article XXIX, which forbids the working of any section of the line between Bagdad and Bussorah that may have been built before com pletion of the main line from Konia to Bagdad. The new Company clearly has no wish to see that district opened up from the Persian Gulf before it has obtained access to it from the north. “ The financial obligations of the Ottoman Govern ment are set forth in Article XXXV. It guarantees a twofold kilometric annuity, one of 11,000 fr. per kilom., built and opened to traffic, and one of 4,500 fr. per kilom. towards working expenses, and provides for the mode of payment of those annuities. An Ottoman State Loan at 4 per cent., with a sinking fund of •087538 per cent., to be guaranteed by special appro priations, which shall be settled before the construction of each successive section is commenced, is to represent the kilometric annuity of 11,000 fr., the Company [581] D10 receiving bonds of a face value of 269,110 fr. 65 c. per kilometre, built and opened to traffic, ihe annuity of 4,500 fr. per kilometre towards working expenses, which is to be gradually reduced as the gross kilometric receipts reach given amounts, is guaranteed on the surplus of the guarantees already appropriated to the Anatolian Railway. The Bagdad Railway Company, moreover, pledges to the holders of the State bonds the whole line from Konia to the Persian Gulf and its branches, and all its rolling-stock, &amp;c., and its share of the net receipts. The bondholders, however, will have no right to interfere in the administration ot the Company. The liabilities of the Ottoman Government under this clause are heavy. It is true that in respect of the Anatolian Railway a kilometric guarantee only very slightly inferior in amount was given by the Porte, that the revenue of both the Konia and Angora lines has shown remarkable expansion, and that, as a set-off to the proportionately diminishing burden on the Treasury, Turkey has materially benefited by the increased prosperity of the provinces thus opened up to trade and agriculture. But the Anatolian Railway, like the two railways from Smyrna, has tapped the richest part of Asia Minor, and if the first two sections of the Bagdad Railway beyond Konia may also be expected to earn a fair revenue, the same can certainly not be predicated of the further sections, and especially not of those which cross the arid wastes of the Upper Euphrates and Tigris basin. There, even according to German estimates, many years, and even decades, must elapse before there can be any results to show for the heavy annual payments which the Turkish Exchequer will have to meet. Even in what were of old the most fertile tracts of Mesopotamia, extensive and costly works of both irrigation and drainage will be required in addition to the railway if anything like its ancient prosperity is to be restored. Many different calculations have been made as to the amount which the kilometric guarantee on the whole Bagdad line is likely to reach, and a very moderate estimate places it at over 1,000,000/. per annum, after allowing for probable revenue. How is the Turkish Exchequer, in its condition of chronic penury, to provide such a large sum ? The Convention itself leaves this question unanswered. But just after the conclusion of the 1902 Convention the Anatolian Company is believed to have intimated to the Porte that it would accept as security for the kilometric guarantee appropriations from an increase of the Turkish customs duties, from the creation of certain monopolies, or from the unification of the Ottoman Debt (which was actually accomplished in 1903). “Nor does Article XXXV represent the whole of Turkey’s financial obligations. Under Article XXXVII the Turkisp Government is to provide two further annuities of 350,000 fr. each, one for a period of thirty years, to cover the cost of betterment works to the extent of 8,000,000 fr. on the Anatolian Company’slines, and another to commence as soon as the new line reaches Aleppo, for the purpose of covering the cost of express train services. “ Under various other Articles a number of minor but valuable rights are conferred upon the Company; exemption from customs dues for all materials, machinery, rolling-stock, iron, wood, coal imported from abroad during the period of construction and extension, and exemption from taxation of the Com pany’s entire property and revenue during the whole term of the Concession; mining and quarrying and forest rights within a zone of 20 kilom. on either side of the line; the right to establish warehouses, ele vators, &amp;c.; to manufacture bricks and tiles, and to make free use of any natural water power in the vicinity of the line for traction and lighting purposes; all of which tend to smooth the way for a monopoly of the economic exploitation of the country. “ The Company undertakes to make provision for postal and telegraphic services, under the control of the Ottoman Government, for the transport of troops in time of war and peace, and for the establishment, at its own expense, of the military posts required by the Ministry of War, up to a total expenditure of 4,000,000 fr., the Government, moreover, remaining at liberty to fortify all such points as it may deem neces sary. The Company also undertakes that within five years from the opening of each section the staff employed upon it, with the exception of the superior officials, shall be composed exclusively of Ottoman subjects. “ The constitution of the Imperial Ottoman Bagdad Railway Company, created under Article VIII of the Convention, is regulated by Statutes. The new Com pany is to have its seat at Constantinople. Whilst the Anatolian Railway Company undertakes, under Article V, to transfer to the new Company the Con cession granted to it under the 1903 Convention, it nevertheless preserves for its own exclnsive benefit all rights and obligations concerning the old Anatolian Railway lines, as well as those which it derives from Articles II, XXXIII, and XXXVII of the above Convention. “ Under Article VI the initial share capital of the Company is fixed at 15,000,000 fr. “Article XII states that the Company will be administered by a Council of Administration, con sisting of eleven members, three of whom shall be nominated by the Anatolian Railway Company. The others will be appointed by the general assembly. Three members shall be Ottoman subjects. “The most important Article, however, is Article XX, under which the Council is invested with the widest powers for administering the property and affairs of the Company, ‘ et pent ineme transiger et compro- mettre.' For it is in virtue of these powers that the Germans, being so far in sole control, were able tonegotiate abroad, and make the proposals for British co-operation which His Majesty’s Government ulti mately had under their consideration.” Part III. The Anglo-German Negotiations of 1903. In December 1899 an Agreement was signed between the Turkish Minister of Commerce and Dr. Siemens, Director of the Deutsche Bank, who was acting on behalf of the Anatolian Railway Company, granting that Company a Concession for the extension of their line to Bagdad. This Agreement was eventually superseded by the Bagdad Railway Convention of the 5th March, 1903, by which the Concession granted to the Anatolian Company was confirmed and extended. It was signed by Dr. Gwinner, President of the Deutsche Bank and successor to Dr. Siemens, and by Dr. Zander, President of the Anatolian Railway Company, on the one side, and by the Turkish Minister of Commerce on the other. A further Agreement was signed the same day, containing the Statutes of the Societe Imp6riale Ottomane du Chemin de Per de Bagdad. Under Article V of these Statutes it is provided that the Anatolian Railway Company, the original concessionnaire, shall transfer to the Bagdad Railway Company (a Company intended to assume an international character) “ the Con cession which has this day been granted to it by the Ottoman Government, with all rights, privileges, and advantages attached thereto or resulting therefrom, and the new Company becomes owner and proprietor of the said Con cession, and succeeds to all the rights and obligations of the concessionnaire,” with the exception of those specially relating to the existing line (from Scutari to Konia) of the Anatolian Railway Company. The Bagdad Railway Concession was thus to be transferred to an international joint stock Company; and it was the wish of the German Syndicate to secure foreign, and particularly British, co-operation in financing the under taking. Sir N. O’Conor, No. 601, December 27, 1899. Sir N. O’Conor No. 217, April 28, 1908.Sir N. O’Conor, i»o. 602, December 27, H99. Sir N. O’Conor, So . 130, April 10, 1900. Sir N. O’Conor, .No. 145, March 26, 1902. Consideration of the Anglo-German negotia tions of 1903 may conveniently be prefaced by a short retrospect of private and official communi cations which took place between British and German Representatives before that year. As early as December 1899 Dr. Siemens told His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople that he had decided, after ascertaining that there was no objection on the part of the German Government, to enlist British capital in the Railway. With this purpose he had approached the Smyrna-Aidin Company. Although his overtures on this occasion had been unsuccessful, and he had afterwards come to an understanding with the (French) Smyrna-Cassaba Company, he hoped none the less to come to an arrange ment in course of time with British capitalists, and, in view of the opposition which the under taking would sooner or later encounter from Russia, he considered it highly important to make the line as international as possible. On the 9th April, 1900, in the course of a conversation with Sir N. O’Conor respecting British relations with the Sheikh of Koweit, the German Ambassador stated that he was fully alive to the inadvisability of doing anything to deter British capitalists from participating in the construction of the line. In June 1901 it was agreed that the French and German groups should take part in the project in equal shares, and, in the event of British participation, each forgo an equal percentage of the capital to be subscribed. In March 1902 certain pourparlers, which led to no definite result, took place between Lord Hillingdon (of the Ottoman Bank), on behalf of the British group, and the French Syndicate. In the same month Lord Lansdowne had a conversation with the German Ambassador, in which he explained the attitude of His Majesty’s Government:— “ The Marquess of Lansdowne to Sir F. Lascelles. “(No. 71.) “Foreign Office, “Sir, “March 18, 1902. “ I told the German Ambassador to-day that the question of the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards the Bagdad Railway had been a good deal discussed of late, and it might be as well that I should inform him of the purport of the answers which I had given when questioned upon the subject. [581] E14 “We did not regard the project with unfriendly eyes ; but if it was to be carried into effect with our support and good-will, we should expect that a share, at least equal to that given to any other Power, should be given to this country in respect of the capital employed for construction of the line, of its manage ment when completed, and of its orders for materials. “ Count Metternich observed that, so tar as he was aware, ‘ the door was open,’ and there was no reason why any amount of British capital should not be invested in the line. On the other hand, it it weie once constructed with capital from other countries, we could not expect to be allowed to come in afterwai ds. “ In reply to a question from him, I said that I understood the proposal to be that the Lurkish laiiff should be increased in order to provide the necessary funds for a kilometric guarantee. It would no doubt be for us to consider, when the time came, whether we were justified in consenting to such an increase, and that would depend to a great extent on the adequacy of the share assigned to us in the enterprise. Desultory negotiations took place between the Separate Paper German Syndicate, on the one hand, and on the offic^^ovem- other Mr. Clinton Dawkins (on behalf of Messrs, ber 13, 1902, Morgan), Sir E. Cassel, and Lord Hillingdon during the summer and autumn of 1902. No satisfactory agreement was reached, and a dispute arose between the Ottoman Bank and the Deutsche Bank as to which of them should place the London shares on the market. The connection of Messrs. Morgan with the concern was certainly unfortunate, owing to the distrust engendered in commercial circles by their action in regard to the Atlantic Shipping Combine. In a Minute dated the 18th June, 1902, on the subject of a proposal made by Lord Roths child and Lord Revelstoke that His Majesty’s Government should themselves take a part of the ordinary shares, as in the case of the Suez Canal, Lord Lansdowne observes :— “ It would, no doubt, be most unusual for a British Government to invest public money in such a project. On the other hand, the acquisition and retention by the British Government of a certain number of shares seems to be the only mode of securing for this country a permanent share in the control of the railway. If we were merely to guarantee a certain number of shares we should have no security that those shares would not find their way into the hands of foreign holders.” “ I am, &amp;c. (Signed) “ LANSDOWNE . 115 To Messrs. Baring, February 24, 1903. Memorandum handed to Lord Revelstoke, March 23, 1903. On the 24th February, 1903, Lord Lansdowne intimated to Messrs. Baring, Sir E. Cassel, and Sir C. Dawkins that, in his opinion, it was undesirable that the railway should be carried out without the participation of Great Britain, and His Majesty’s Government arranged that the management of the British participation in the scheme should be placed in the hands of Messrs. Baring. During the same month arrangements were made that Lord Revelstoke, on behalf of Messrs. Baring, should represent the British group officially at a meeting fixed to be held in Paris on the 24th March, for the purpose of settling and discussing details. At this meeting Lord Revelstoke handed to Mr. Gwinner a Memorandum fixing and em bodying the objects for which, in the opinion of the representatives of the English group present, the assistance of His Majesty’s Government might be obtained. They stood as follows :— “ § 1. To agree to a reasonable increase in the Turkish Customs Tariff, in connection with the pending negotiations for a new Commercial Treaty, and to offer no opposition to the inclusion of a portion of the increased customs revenue among the guarantees for the Bagdad Company. “ § 2. Should the new route offer substantial advan tages over existing routes for the carnage of mails to India, to make use of it for the purpose on terms to be agreed upon between His Majesty’s Government and the Company. “ § 3. To give assistance (not, of course, pecuniary) towards the provision of a terminus, with proper facili ties, at or near Koweit, and co-operate in procuring convenient customs arrangements.” Mr. Gwinner suggested that the participation should take the following form 25 per cent, to Germany. 25 per cent, to England. 25 per cent, to France. 10 per cent, to the Anatolian Company. 15 per cent, to minor nations. On the 7th April Lord Lansdowne had a conversation with Lord Revelstoke and Sir E. Cassel, which is recorded in the following Memorandum:— “I told Lord Revelstoke and Sir E. Cassel that a uerious attempt was apparently being made in the16 press to discredit the enterprise, and to render it impossible for His Majesty’s Government to associate themselves in any way with it, upon the ground that it was closely connected with the German Government and detrimental to British interests. We felt that, until we were better able to judge of the proportions which this hostile movement might assume, it would be desirable that we should avoid giving it any farther encouragement. The matter would come before Parliament before the House adjourned, and we should, therefore, be better able in a few days to decide as to our future action. My own view was that the attack was founded upon misapprehensions, and I strongly deprecated any modification of the attitude which we had hitherto assumed. I was assured by Sir E. Cassel and Lord Revelstoke that they had up to the present in no way committed His Majesty’s Government. The formula given to Lord Revelstoke on the 23rd March had been used only for the purpose of sketching * suggestions ’ which might be made to His Majesty’s Government on the part of the British group, should the British and foreign groups be able to come to terms. It was in these circumstances entirely for us to decide whether we desired to proceed further, and if the negotiations were continued, nothing could be concluded either as to the constitution of the Board of Directors or as to other matters of detail until we had been thoroughly satisfied. They explained to me that, in their view, the participation w^as to take place upon a ‘ basis of absolute equality as between English, French, and German interests,’ and that ‘ no one group was to be given any superiority or control.’ They also explained that the Anatolian Railway would be amalgamated with the main project, and that the three members of the Board who had been described as to be nominated by the Anatolian Railway would be nominated by the whole Board. France, Germany, and England would have eight members each, and no one Power would, therefore, be able to override the wishes of the other two, which would command 16 votes out of a total of 30. (Signed) “Lansdowne. “Foreign Office, April 7, 1903.” The press campaign against the scheme was meanwhile becoming increasingly violent, and on the 23rd April a declaration was made in Parliament by tbe Prime Minister to the effect that His Majesty’s Government had withdrawn their support from the scheme. The nature of the press criticisms, and the extent to which they were well founded, is con- sidered in the final part of this Memorandum (see p. 29).Prospects of Completion of the Line without British Co-operation. [The quotations throughout are in f sterling.] The length of the main line of the Bagdad Railway, from Konia to Bussorah, will be about 2,000 kilom., or 1,250 miles. The length of the extension, from Bussorah to Koweit, if ultimately decided upon, will he 160 kilom., or 100 miles. From Bagdad to Koweit vi&amp; Bussorah, the approximate distance will be 720 kilom., or 450 miles. The construction of the line between Konia and Bussorah, 2,000 kilom., is to he executed in ten sections, each 200 kilom. in length. It is provided in Article XXXV of the Con vention that the Ottoman Government shall furnish a two-fold kilometric security, one an annuity of 11,000 fr. per kilom., built and open to traffic, the other a guarantee of 4,500 fr. per kilom. for working expenses. They correspond respectively to 700/. and 290/. per mile. For the purposes of this Memorandum they may be described as the “ construction annuity ” and the “ working expenses guarantee.’’ The construction annuity is to he capitalized and paid in Ottoman State Bonds, hearing in terest at 4 per cent, and including a sinking fund which will extinguish the loan in the period of the concession. The nominal amount of the bonds to be given to the concession-holder is 269,110 fr. 65 c. per kilom. The loan is to he guaranteed by special appro priations, such as specific tithes, to he determined before the commencement of each successive section of 200 kilom. The conditions under which the working ex penses guarantee is granted are as follows :— Until the gross receipts per kilometre (of the section concerned) reach 4,500 fr., the difference between this sum and the actual receipts will be paid by the Ottoman Government to the Company each year. When the gross kilometric receipts exceed 4,500 fr., hut have not reached 10,000 fr., the entire surplus, after 4,500 fr., goes to the Ottoman Government. When the gross kilo metric receipts surpass 10,000 fr., [581] F-an ailglTTiTl lit (Tgntmues up to a total rrceipt of^ fp_ the excess over tliis sum is divided between the Government and the Com pany in the proportion of GO per cent, and 40 per cent. The working expenses guarantee is secured on and paid from the surplus of the revenues already allocated to the kilometric guarantees of the Anatolian Railway. The first section of the railway, from Konia to Eregli, was opened to trafih; in October, 1904. The distance to Eregli is only 190 kilom., so the line was prolonged to Rourgourlou, 10 kilom. beyond Eregli, in order to complete the 200 kilom. The loan for the first section (Bagdad Railway Loan, first series, 1903) was taken up at 86'40, and produced about 46,502,320 fr., or 1,860,092/. The estimates of the actual expenditure on this section show considerable discrepancy. Sir G. Clarke, in a letter and inclosure dated 7th April, 1906, estimates the cost at the rate of not less than 8,000/. per mile for construction alone, without including rolling-stock. Erom a careful comparison of available data, the cost of the first section (125 miles) would appear to have amounted to 840,000/. for rolling- stock and construction. This sum is composed as follows : — Rolling-stock, at rate of 1,024/. per mile Construction, at rate of 5,696/. per mile Jt .. 128,000 .. 712,000 Total The cost per mile works out:— .. 840,000 Ground-work Permanent-way and stations.. Rolling-stock* £ .. 1,472 .. 4,224 .. 1,024 Total .. 6,720 To the cost of the first section must be added a sum of 172,000/. spent in faux-frais to Turkish officials and in surveys over the whole line. It is believed that the “ backsheesh ” for the whole Concession was defrayed out of the profits on this section. Estimating, therefore, the total expenditure at 1,012,000/., and deducting it from the product of the first loan (1,860,092/.), there remains a balance of 818,092/. Of this about 400,000/., certainlv not less, w as constituted into a reserve fund for later sections, and the rest was distributed. * The Estimate for rolling-stock is based on the informa tion supplied by three independent local experts,An alternative estimate to the above may be found in the contract price with Messrs. Hetz- mann and Company, of Frankfort, which was 8,512/. for ground-work, permanent-way, and rolling-stock. The balance of opinion is that this is above the price actually paid. The length of the section being 125 miles, the amount under this estimate works out at 1,064,000/.; but this estimate omits all mention of surveys and “ back sheesh ” included in the total of 1,012,000/. given above. In any case, it is calculated that there is a reserve fund of about 400,000/. towards the next section. The next section (usually described as Eregli to Adana, but really from Bourgourlou to a point 26 kilom. beyond Adana) is by far the most difficult from an engineering point of view. From kilom. 200 to 220 the gradient is 15 metres per kilom. From kilom. 220 to 320 it varies between 16 and 17 metres. From kilom. 320 to 400 it is apparently less. In the section of 200 kilom. there are thirteen bridges of from 10 to 90 metres, of which the total length is nearly 500 metres; and 32 tunnels of from 20 to 1,440 metres, of a total length of nearly 9| kilom. There are, therefore, 10 kilom. or 6^ miles of bridging and tunnelling on this section, and there will he in addition an enormous amount of blasting and some side-tunnelling, besides several cuttings through bed-rock. There are 50 “ difficult ” and 75 relatively “ easy ” miles on this section. It is estimated that the ground-work of the former will work out at 38,400/. per mile. This, for the 50 miles, amounts to 1,920,000/. The ground-work of the “ easy ” portion works out at 2,560/. per mile, or 192,000/. for the 75 miles. The ground-work for the whole section of 125 miles is thus estimated to cost 2,112,000/. The estimate for the permanent-way and stations is at the uniform rate of 4,224/. per mile, which for 125 miles works out at 528,000/. The total construction cost for this section will then amount to 2,112,000/. plus 528,000/., or 2,640,000/., and to this must again he added 128,000/. for rolling-stock at the rate of 1.024/. per mile. The grand total for the section will therefore amount to 2,768,000/. If taken up at 86'40, the loan for this section would produce about 46,502,320 fr., or 1,860,092/.20 There will therefore be a deficit of 907,908/. on this section. This deficit may be reduced to 507,908/. by having recourse to the reserve fund of 400,000/. on the first section. The balance of the deficit may be met by undertaking the construction of three sections at once. It is estimated that the third and fourth sections, 0 each 125 miles (200 kilom.) in length, will not cost more than the first. Two figures were given as alternative estimates for the cost of the first section, namely, 6,720/. and 8,512/. per mile. For the sake of prudence the higher of these two figures may be taken. The cost of the third and fourth sections will thus be 8,512/. X 250, which is 2,128,000/. If the loan is issued at the same price as the first (86*40), it will produce a net sum of 3,720,184/. The profit on the two sections will therefore be 1,592,184/. The deficit on the second section (Eregli- Adana) has been calculated at 507,908/., as above. The ultimate profit on the construction of the second, third, and fourth sections will therefore be 1,084,276/. The remaining sections (six of 200 kilom.) to Bussorah are not believed to present any great or very costly engineering difficulties, although the ground is stated in certain districts to be some- w r hat marshv. The distance is 1,200 kilom., or 750 miles. At the rate of 8,512/. per mile this works out at 6,384,000/. The construction annuities, when capitalised on the basis, and if taken up at the price (86*40) indicated above (see page 17), will produce a net sum of 11,160,552/. Cor 1,200 kilom. The profit on the last six sections will thus be 4,//6,552/., which, together with the profit on the second, third, and fourth sections (1,084,276/.) will show a total profit on the line of 5,860,828/. An examination of the available revenues will show that the promoters of the railway need not feel great anxiety as to the provision of securities for the kilometric guarantees. In the first place, there is the surplus of the tithes collected by the Debt amounting to 270,000/. The surplus of the revenues collected by the Debt, of which 75 per cent, revert to the * Mr. Wigham, in his book “ The Persian Problem,” much exaggerates the engineering difficulties of the third section.Government, represent another 270,000/., and this sum is considered likely to . increase. 111,475/. of the last-named amount is, however, already assigned to the Ottoman Bank Loan of 2,500,000/. (not yet issued). It would seem that from these sources sufficient money can be found for raising the construction capital. If the Germans do not obtain, as they desire, the assignment of the surplus revenues of the Debt, the Government will probably be called upon, particularly if the imposition of the 3 per cent. Customs surtax is arranged, to assign fresh tithes. It should be borne in mind, however, that as soon as the Konia-Eregli section is linked to the Mediterranean seaboard the profits of the line will increase, and the working guarantee for that section will diminish in proportion, and may be utilized towards guaranteeing the con struction annuity for the further sections. Nevertheless, if new tithes are required, it is stated that the Government have them at their disposal. The tithes of the Empire give 4,320,000/. in round figures per annum. The amount assigned already for kilometric guarantees is 1,530,000/., leaving a balance of 2,790,000/. If they are placed in the hands of the Debt administration, it is calculated that by a better system of collection they would yield 20 per cent. more. The Government could also still further pledge the Aghnam or sheep tax. It produces 1,778,400/., of which 146,430/. is already pledged, leaving a balance of 1,631,970/. The system of collection is in course of improvement. It is, indeed, evident that the Ottoman Govern ment cannot indefinitely continue on this course of pledging the best revenues of the country, and that a deficit in the National Exchequer will necessarily result. At the present time there would appear to be insufficient revenue to meet current expenditure, the internal finances are in great disorder, and daily expenses are increasing by leaps and bounds owing to the general ex travagance of Ottoman administration. The creation of fresh debt, and the assignment of fresh revenues for the service of new loans— the policy of the Erench Syndicates—and the appropriation of fresh revenues for the construc tion of railways — the policy of the German Syndicates—must eventually lead to disaster, and [581] G22 consequently to extended control by the Debt administration. It may be that the French and German Syndicates realize that the crisis must come sooner or later, and prefer to hasten rather than retard it. An explanation of Germany’s wish for foreign co-operation may possibly be sought in the tear of this crisis; it being perhaps her hope to associate other Powers in the work of instituting an efficient system of European control over the Ottoman financial administration in all its hranches in the event of such a crisis arising. According to Article XXXV of the Convention of 1903, the working expenses guarantee of 4,500 fr. per kilom. is to be paid from the surplus of the tithes at present assigned for payment of the kilometric guarantees of the Anatolian Railway Company. The average surplus for the five years ended 1904 is 44,616/. In 1905,22,739/. was paid in kilometric guaran tees towards the working of the Konia-Eregli section. With the tacit consent of the Government, and by an arrangement between the various railway Companies, the deficit in the sums assigned for the payment of kilometric guaran tees on any one or more lines in Turkey is Qovered by the surplus on the other lines. The average surplus for the five yeirs ended 1904 of the tithes in question, including the revenues assigned for the Osmanie and Fisheries Loans, which also come into the Agreement, was 206,763/. This Agreement does not extend to the Bagdad line. If there is a deficit on that line, it can only be made good from the surplus on the Anatolian lines, and not from the surplus of the kilometric guarantees in general. An arrangement might, however, easily be come to on this point. It would require the consent of the Government and an understanding between the French and German lines. If the French entered the Bagdad Railway scheme such an arrangement might be concluded. Thus, in any case, there is a sum of 44,61.6/. per annum available for the Bagdad Railway, and if a fmthei arrangement, as mentioned, is come to, there will be a surplus of 206,763/. available. Further, the surplus of the Fisheries loan—a German loan—amounts to over 50,400/., and might be earmarked for the railway. Moreover, the existing sections of the Anatolian line have caused, and will continue to cause a23 &amp; H-'i ! &lt; Board of Trade Meraorandura, June 1905. steady and permanent increase in the tithes of the districts through which they pass. The general conclusion from the above statistics is that, from financial considerations, British co-operation will certainly not be a sine qud non of the construction of the railway, more especially if French capitalists continue, as at present, to take part in the scheme. A full survey of the line has not, however, yet been carried out, nor has any estimate of the cost of railway guards in the disturbed districts been prepared. There is the further element of a possible default on the part of the Ottoman Government, and of the crisis which would ensue. There is, therefore, reason to suppose that Germany is averse to taking all the financial as well as political responsibilities of this great enterprise, and would welcome British and French co-operation, let, if she is obliged to go on single-handed, she will not, it would seem, be deterred, in spite of the financial difficulties of the Turkish Treasury, and of the obstacles which may be placed in the way of establishing a terminus at Koweit. Part V. The Influence of the Railway on British Interests. A railroad which owes its existence to an elaborate system of Government subsidies, and is destined to form a direct line of communica tion between the German Empire and the shores of the Persian Gulf, must be regarded in the light of no ordinary commercial venture. The promoters of this scheme have proclaimed their policy of supplanting British trade in a region where till recently competition was non existent. The trade of Bussorah and Bagdad, valued at 2,500,000/. in 1903, has been a virtual monopoly of Great Britain and India; 50 per cent, of the river transport between these two towns has been effected in British bottoms; and of the total steam-ship tonnage entered in 1900 at Bussorah, 96 per cent, was British. Nor is I '24 the trade influence of the railway likely to be confined within the Mesopotamian vilayets, for its completion under German auspices bids fair to ruin British commerce with South-Western Persia, and, in regard to one route alone, to involve an annual loss of 750,000/. If these facts are considered in conjunction with the projected economic penetration of a country, hitherto regarded as a possible outlet for the surplus populations of India, then, indeed, the Bagdad Bailway Scheme appears fraught, in its commercial aspects alone, with potential consequences of a most serious and far- reaching character. In a review of the circumstances which led in 1903 to the refusal of His Majesty’s Government to lend the enterprise their support, His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople thus sums up his conclusions:— “hor must it be forgotten that the Railway Conces sion carries with it many valuable privileges and advantages. Apart from the large orders for materials tor railway construction, &amp;c., it secures extensive mining rights on each side of the line, the right of navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates during the construction of the railway, a Concession which will probably be unlimitedly extended, a commercial outlet either at Koweit or elsewhere in the Persian Gulf, an exception ally favourable position in the future for all enterprise connected with the irrigation of Mesopotamia, &amp;c. Moreover, it can hardly be supposed that no effort will be made to supplant British navigation in its privileged position in the Persian Gulf, and to take advantage of the opportunity to compete with British shipping in those waters. “ It is also to be feared that the preponderance of foreign Powers in the valley of the Tigris will react upon British influence in Western Persia in the same way as England s exclusion from a public enterprise so intimately connected with the progress and develop ment of the country will affect her prestige and position throughout Asia Minor.” On the 5th May, 1903, Lord Lansdowne made a declaration in the House of Lords to the following effect:— “ ft owing to British enterprise, to the expenditure of British lives and money, that the Persian Gulf is at this moment open to the navigation of the world. It was our ships that cleared those waters of pirates; it was we who put down the Slave Trade; it was we who buoyed and beaconed those intricate waters .... and, although we certainly could not aim at excluding Sir N. O’Conor No. 217, April 28, ISo?the legitimate trade of other nations, this country stands with regard to the navigation of the Gulf in a position different from that of any other Power, and our policy should be directed to protect and promote British trade in those waters.” It would be difficult to contend that this policy is finding practical application, if a railway, calculated to dominate the principal markets of the Persian Gulf, is gratuitously abandoned to the control of an energetic and powerful rival; and the co-operation of Great Britain, as a measure of self-protection, would appear imperative, even if the contingency of financial difficulty cannot be altogether excluded. But it is not upon commercial considerations alone that the advent of a German railway must occasion conceru. In an oft-quoted, article, which appeared in the “National Beview” of September 1902, Captain Mahan, U.S.N., expressed his views of British policy in the Gulf in the following sentence :— “ Concession in the Persian Gulf, whether by formal arrangement with other Powers or by neglect of the local commercial interests which now underlie political and military control, will imperil Great Britain’s naval situation in the Far East, her political position in India, her commercial interests in both, and the Imperial tie between herself and Australasia.” The General Staff, in a Memorandum (45 B) of the 15th November, 1904, “pointed out the disadvantages—political, commercial, and stra- tegic—which the control by Germany of a line to the Persian Gulf would entail upon Great Britain.” At a meeting of the Imperial Defence Com mittee held on the 12th April, 1905, the conclu sion was recorded “that it is important that England should have a shire in the control of the extension of the Bagdad Bailway to the Persian Gulf, with a view to insuring the effective neutralization of the terminus.” In a Memorandum prepared for the Committee of Imperial Defence by Sir G. Clarke, on the 26th January, 1905, it is observed “ We are therefore confronted with a project which if carried out under German auspices, will undoubtedly inflict grave mjury upon our commeice, and must ultimately destroy our political influence in Southern Persia and in the deltas of the Tigris and Euphrates. [581] 11We have the strongest grounds for preventing the control of a railway from Bagdad to the Gulf from falling wholly under the control of a Bower which regards its own interests exclusively, and which veil understands the manipulation of railway rates. While such is a summary of authoritative statements in regard to the detrimental effects upon British interests of a railway placed under the exclusive control of a great military and industrial nation, the balance of opinion would appear to favour the view that, if the line were made a joint concern, or to be internationalized, the damage to British prestige would not be so evident, and that to military interests consider ably modified, while the competition to commerce would be rather stimulating than destructive. The various conditions which, in the event of British participation in the scheme, are considered of importance, and practical suggestions for the conclusion of an international arrangement on the subject, are set forth in some detail in the sub joined Memorandum, which was prepared by Sir G. Clarke in August 1905 :— “ If the construction of the line is proceeded with, our object must be to secure the control of the Bussorah- Bagdad section. “ It seems possible that Germany might be induced to yield that condition if we met her in other directions. “ M. Gambon, in a recent conversation with Lord Lansdowne, expressed the opinion that the French Government would not favour this proposal, but it is doubtful whether the French Government has given full consideration to the subject. “ At present Germany has complete control over the Anatolian Railway, and France has a monopoly of railway construction in Syria as far south as Mezerib. “ British control of the Bussorah-Bagdad section might fairly be regarded as a legitimate counterpoise to the French and German railways in Syria and Asia Minor respectively. “In view of our present cordial relations with the French Government, it seems probable that, if repre sentations were made, no opposition would be offered to the proposal that we should control this section of the line, more particularly as we should undertake not to establish differential tariffs in our own favour. “ It is clear from the former negotiations that the German Government is strongly averse from the inter nationalization of the Anatolian Railway. We might without serious disadvantage consent to the Anatolian Railway remaining under German control, provided that we were given control of the Bussorah-Bagdad section,and that the 10 per cent, participation and share in the directorate by the Anatolian Railway of the Bagdad Railway previously stipulated for were withdrawn. “ France, Germany, England, and the minor Powers might then combine to participate in the construction, on an international basis, of that part of the Bagdad Railway which lies between Konieh and Bagdad (about 900 miles), together with any branches that might be constructed between these two points, such as those to Alexandretta and Aleppo. “ The Board ot the international section might bo composed in the following proportion :— Country. Percentage. Great Britain 30 France ... ••• ••• 30 Germany • •• 30 Minor nations ... 10 Total 100 “ Or, it there is any possibility of inducing the United States to participate, the proportion might be:— Country. Percentage. Great Britain 22 United States 22 France ... 22 Germany 22 Minor nations 12 Total 100 u Provision would have to be made to secure to participants proportionate shares in the provision of railway materiel for the international portion of the line. It would further be desirable that arrangements should be made to pool the receipts of the German, French, English, and International Companies, and that a mutual guarantee should be given by all the Companies that they will not establish discriminating tarifis in favour of or against the trade of individual nations. “ Such arrangements would concede to the Germans a point which they were clearly unwilling to yield in the former negotiations ; and, provided that access to Alexandretta by the international line is assured, the Germans, even if they evaded the Agreement by granting rebates on the Anatolian Railway to German traders, would not be able to injure our trade on any section of the line to Konieh, as goods arriving via the Mediterranean would be sent to Konieh as cheaply by Alexandretta as by Haidar Pasha. “An arrangement of the nature described above would require the establishment of a clearing-house charged with the duty of apportioning receipts and expenditure on through traffic. The management of28 the clearing-house would be in the hands of a Mixed Committee of the several Boards. “ If the entire system could be placed under bond fide international control, British interests would be adequately safeguarded, but the difficulties appear insuperable. It is extremely unlikely that the Germans would consent to internationalize the Ana tolian Railway, while the French would probably object strongly to a similar arrangement in regard to the Syrian lines. “On the whole, the arrangement above suggested seems the most practical at the present time, and it might be desirable to sound the French Government on the subject. “ The following is a summary of the proposals :— “ (a.) Germany to retain control and management of the Anatolian Railway. “ (&amp;.) France to retain control and management of the Syrian railways. “ (c.) Great Britain to construct, control, and manage the Bagdad Gulf section. “ (d.) The intervening section, with branches and connections, to be internationalized. “ (e.) The international section to be controlled by a Board on which the Great Powers are equally represented. “(/.) Materials for the international section to be provided by the Powers in proportion to their financial participation. “(^.) The Powers to undertake not to impose differential rates on the sections they severally control. “ (A.) The receipts on the entire system to be pooled and distributed by a clearing-house managed by a Committee from the several Boards.” In addition to the above-mentioned conditions, Board of Trade Article XXIX of the Bagdad Bailway Convention ^uieTooi 11113 would have to he so modified as to admit the working of the Bagdad Gulf section as soon as completed. In the opinion of the Board of Trade it is also essential that the waterways in this region, as well as the railroad, should be under British control, not only in order to facilitate the work of construction, but also to prevent the Turkish steamers on the Tigris from undercutting the railway freights. Down-stream rates are some times as low as \d. per ton per mile, whereas the lowest freight rates on the Anatolian Railway in 1902-1903 averaged f d.29 Sir N. O’Couor No. 217, April 28, 1903. It remains to consider the causes of the violent outburst in the press, which, in 1903, rendered the negotiations with Germany abortive, and which, in the event of a renewal of negotiations at the present time, would not improbably occasion much anxiety in regard to their success. This popular indignation, as in the case of the proposed joint action by England and Germany against Venezuela, was due to the suspicions with which the public viewed any co-operation between this country and Germany —a state of mind which had gradually grown up owing to the conviction that Germany could no longer be considered as a friendly Power. This feeling received its fullest confirmation by the attitude of Germany during the South African War. It was also due to misapprehension as to the conditions under which it was proposed to enlist British capital, and, indeed, as to the ability of Germany to utilize the Concession single-handed. Motives of sentimental aversion constitute no sufficient reason for refusal to engage in business which can be shown, on investigation, to be bene ficial to the parties concerned. On the other hand, those considerations which led, on practical grounds, to substantial objections on the part of the investing public are of practical significance, and accordingly deserving of the most careful attention. Into this subject His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople entered at considerable length in a despatch dated the 28th April, 1903:— “It is to be regretted that misapprehensions have been caused by incomplete or incorrect publication of the documents in the case. The Concession for the Bagdad Railway was obtained in the first instance by the Anatolian Railway Company. It is therefore natural that, in the Convention of the 5th March, 1903, embodying this Concession, that Company appears as the concessionnaire of all rights and privileges in question. It does not, however, remain in possession of these lights. Under Article 5 of the Statutes of the ‘ SocititS Imperiale Ottomane du Chemin de Fer de Bagdad’ it is provided that the Anatolian Railway Company shall transfer to the new Company ‘ the Concession which has been granted to it by the Imperial Ottoman Government, with all rights, privileges, and advantages attached thereto or re sulting therefrom, and the new Company becomes owner and proprietor of the said Concession, and [581] I30 succeeds to all the rights and obligations of the con- cessionnaire,’ with the exception of those specially relating to the existing line of the Anatolian Railway Company “ The result of the constitution [of the Board of the new Company, as proposed in 1903] would be that any two of the groups [German, d rench, and English] could command an absolute majority, and that the Company would be really international in the sense that it would be impossible to direct its policy and working to the benefit of any single country at the expense of the others. “ It has been represented that the Railway could be worked in a manner detrimental to British commerce by means of direct or indirect advantages, of special rates, through rates, rebates, or exemptions accorded to the goods of other countries, or to goods arriving by particular routes. This apprehension is not well founded. Such preferences are directly prohibited by Articles 24 and 25 of the ‘ Cahier des Charges’ of the Bagdad Railway, and by corresponding provisions applicable to the Anatolian Railway. They would also be excluded by a clause of the proposed Treaty of Commerce; and, in any case, the execution of these stipulations in the spirit, as well as in the letter, could undoubtedly be secured by the participation of British capital and the consequent international character of the Company. “ It has been pointed out, in the course of the dis cussions in the press and elsewdiere, that, so long as the Anatolian Railway from Haidar Pasha to Konia remains in German hands, the international character of the line from Konia onwards will not be a sufficient guarantee for impartial treatment; that the German Company will, in fact, hold the key of the door by which the through traffic must pass. This is a point of the first importance, deserving careful consideration ; but an examination of the whole position will go far, at any rate, to dispel any anxiety on this account. In the first place, the representatives of the Anatolian Railway Company have formally announced their readiness to vest the control of their line in the Inter national Company at some future period; and there are sufficient guarantees for the carrying out of this undertaking in the fact that it would be open to the British Government, in the event of failure to carry it out, to refuse the promised facilities for a port in the Persian Gulf, and to withdraw their assurance as to conveyance of the Indian mails; and also in the fact that, when the Bagdad line nas been completed throughout the greater part of its length, it would be so indispensable to the prosperity of the Anatolian line that the latter could not afford to take up a hostile or exclusive attitude. This is the more certain since Haidar Pasha does not afford the only point of access.“ Fears have been expressed that at one moment or another either Germany or France, or possibly both countries, may, for political reasons, come to terms with Russia and find it in their interest to make over their share, or else to buy off her hostility by supporting her claims for Russian access to the shores of the Persian Gulf. These are contingencies, however, which might arise in any case, whether England participates or not in the construction of the Railway. Indeed, an arrangement with Russia would be more urgently required, and at the same time more easy of accomplishment, if England stands out than if she participates.” The principal contentions of the press in regard to the inadvisability of British participa tion are dealt with in the extracts from Sir N. O’Conor’s despatch, but particular capital was made out of certain assurances which were requested from His Majesty’s Government in the event of a basis of co-operation being agreed upon. The assurances in question were as follows:— 1. That objection should not be raised to the increase of the Turkish customs duties, of which a part should be used in guarantees for the Bagdad Railway. 2. That if the Railway should prove a sub stantially better route for conveying the mails to India, it should receive the subsidy at present granted to British steam-ship lines. 3. That His Majesty’s Government should lend their good offices in providing a proper terminus at or near Koweit. The first and third points are now devoid of practical interest, since the increase of the customs is in process of arrangement, and the additional revenue is to he devoted to the xequiie- ments of Macedonian reform ; while a British officer, dispatched to the Persian Gulf on a special mission to carry out surveys on the spot, has recently reported that Koweit is by no means the only convenient terminus, various places, outside the limits of any possible extension of British protection, being equally suitable for the purpose in view. The second point is one of considerable importance. It is, however, merely a question of degree, and it may be doubted whether thecompensatory gains to British trade as a whole would not, in the long run, outweigh the immediate loss incurred by the mercantile (Signed) ALWYN PARKER. Foreign Office, March 10, 1906.(The distances are approximate.) The ANATOLIAN RAILWAY, including branches to Adabazar and Angora, has a total length of 645 miles. The direct line from Scutari (opposite Constantinople) to Konia is 496 miles, viz.: Scutari to Eski Shehir, 216 ; and thence to Konia, 280. From Afium Karahissar to Scutari the distance is 295 miles. The SMYRNA-CASSABA RAILWAY works 324 miles. From Afium Karahissar to Smyrna the distance is 260 miles. The SMYRNA-AIDIN RAILWAY works 322 miles. From the present rail-head to Konia the distance is 110 miles, and if a junction were effected the distance from Konia to Smyrna would be 340 miles. The MERSINA-ADANA RAILWAY works 42 miles. The BAGDAD RAILWAY is to run from Konia, vi4 Adana, Mosul and Bagdad to Bussorah, but it is probable that the eventual terminus will be at a point further east than Bussorah. The railway distance from Konia to Bagdad is roughly 900 miles, and from Bagdad to Bussorah it is 360 miles, and from Bussorah to Koweit 100 miles. The first section from Konia to Bourgourlou (6 miles beyond Eregli) was opened in October, 1904.compensatory gains to British trade as a whole would not, in the long run, outweigh the immediate loss incurred by the mercantile marine.
