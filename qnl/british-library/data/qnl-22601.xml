Otherwise we have no comment to make. I will send you a separate letter on the question oi the Southern limit of your concession which you raised in our discussion on ICth January.

We left in Article 20 at this stage, with discretion to Mylles to cut it out at any stage of his discussions vdth the Shaikh. I enclose 7 further copies of the map for attachment, v«hich differ from the 5 copies I sent you before in the omission of the note in tue left hand corner as to the authority for the map, and the addition in Arabic of Qatr at the top and Dohah above the English name. I thought it rather unkind to proffer the Shaikh a map on which he could not read one single nameI I assuae that the supporting letter you are writing on the question of the southern limit of the concession will confirm that the boundary as shown in our map is acceptable to Government.

January 1935. vO l^iy dear George, jiv Would you please refer to paragraph 7 of the record of a discussion with the A^P.O.G# on 10th January, copies of which were sent to you and to the Admiralty and petroleum Department under our printed letter F«Zf271/35 of 14th January, which aeals with the Company's request that we should let them know whether » regard tne southern limit for their concession shown on the nap of Qatar of which they have let us have copies as satisfactory '2. TJie line in question runs sli b htly to the north (particularly in tne Jebel Dukhan area) of the line which has previously toeen recognised by H.M.G. as the southern tiounaary of Qatar and to which we are proposing to work as against Ion 3aud. ihat line is, of course, more or less identical with the ^itar protection limit which was agreed last Mirch. I do not see any difficulty in these circumstances in its adoption/ G.Y/, Rendel, Esq., C.M.G., Foreign Office.- 2 - adoption tiy the Company as the soutnern liiuit of their concession, ior, as we made clear to them in the discussion on 10th January, the limit of their concession need not necessarily he as extensive as that of the sheikh*s territories recognised hy or of any protection which they might give to him. 5. It is arguable, on the other hand, that now that we nave reason to helieve tnat the Jehel Dukhan structure is likely to he petroliferous there might he advantage in the Company endeavouring straibht away to secure a line running from the head of the Dohat as Salwa to just north of tne Khor al Oaeia and giving them at any rate tne northern part of tne hills marked as Qern Ahu Wail on their nap. 4. On the whole, however, I think we should ao hest to reply to them in the terms of the draft enclosed? Satisfactory as it would he if we could include in their concession the small additional area referred to in paragraph 3, I am inclined to douht, given the political complexities with which we are at present faced, if it is worth raising this issue. If we can reacn a satisfactory agreement with Ibn 3aud as regards/regarcis boundaries on the basis of a iine running from the head of the Dohat as 3alwa to the boundary of Abu Dhabi, some small rectification of the area granted to the Company coula no aoubt be considered. And in any event the additional area now under consideration would, if we secure the boundary at which we aim, fall outside the area of the Hasa oil concession. 5. I am sending a similar letter to seal at the Admiralty and the letter of wnich a copy is enclosed to pirie at the Air Ivlinistry, as the boundary question is, of course, of interest to both Departments. I am also sending copies of the correspondence to starling. Yours ever, GILBSx^T LA I Hi WAITS.INDIA OFFICE, WHIIKtULL, 1. P.Z.307/35. 22na January 1935.

He has been negotiating now for about a week arid, though ver&gt; wisely he is not hurrying matters, there should be some result I think one way or the other in the near future; i.e. either OO he will have got the concession, or (B) the Shaikh will have refused to give it to hira. 2. In the case of (A)* The Shaikh will havv, to be presented, with the Political Agreement between His kajoty's Government and the Company He may raise some objections to some of its clauses, but having accented the Comi.Arcial Agreement, and being naturally anxious to beneiit by its linancial terms, his objections should be surmountable. 3.

Loch or 1 will nave to approach the Shaikh, but before we do so it se-ms to m tnat 1 shall have to be authorised on behalf of His I5ajesty&gt;s Government to inform him (the Shaikh) in writing to the following (1) That though we do not intend 01 course to lorce him to give the concession to the rv. .C.C. - !• • c *» unae the terms of Clause V of his Treaty of 1916 he is again reminded that he is not permitted to give any concession without His Majesty's Government's permission.

It is obviously impossible to allow tnis sort of situation to materialise. To prevent it I should be further authorised to remind the Shaikh of what he s id, and to point out that it would be merely a waste of time and money on the part of any Company to approach him, and to make a survey, etc. unless they had first ascertained from His Majesty's Govornrfient that permission would be given. 4. In addition to this warning to the Shaikh it might also be necessary to isoue a similar warning to the Caliiomia Arabian Stanaard Oil Company. » 5.

The Shaikh's demands in regard to Articles -.2 and 16 would apx^ear to affect His Majesty's Government either directly or indirectly. Article 12.

Unless both the Shaikh and the Political Resident agreed on the choice of an Umpire a deadlock will result. 3.

P.Z.1580/35. i\iy dear Fowls, cjatar Oil I enclose copy of a memorandum summarising / the corresponaence between IVtylles and the A.P.O#C. between 26th February ana 3rd A!Lrch, which was left with me by Lefroy on 5th March, we discussed the points arising on the various articles with the following result; Article 1 . No comment, except that it seems desirable that both the A.P#O.C. and the India Office shoula see the redraft. Article 2 . The Sheikh 's suggestion that the period must turn upon the financial terms is, of course, a matter of bargaining. Article 3 . Reports on demand. I gather that the Company see no objection. Article 4 . Royalty basis to be won and saved as in previous draft. This is the same point as arose in the/ 3 Hon'ble Lt.col. T.G. Fowle, C,B,i., Bush ire.- a - the case of Koweit. It ? again, 13 a case of bargaining. Article 5 . Records on demand. I gather that the Company see no special objection. Article 6 . It is perhaps reasonable that imports should be through Dohah. If the main oil-bearing structure proves to be in the Jebel Dukhan it would prima facie be more convenient that a special port of export (probably with a pipeline, as in Bahrein) should be agreea on that side of the Qatar Peninsula and I gather that the Company would not see objection to this. But the terms of the sheikh^ request are In any event quite reasonable, since tne port of export is to be a matter for agreement between the Company and the sheikh. No difficulty arises, I understand, about the use of the Company's facilities for personal or Government business by the sheikh, nor aoes any special difficulty arise as regards aircraft. (Incidentally, if and when the Company obtain their concession and start to operate in Qatar, we shall have to consiaer securing from the sheikh an understanding in regard to flights over Qatar, etc. similar to those which we have obtained in Koweit, Bahrein and Muscat. Article 7/- 3 - } article 7 . There need be no Question of any Government pressure In regard to the acquisition of land, etc. I gather that the Company see no special difficulty about agreeint to reversion to the sheikh, free of cost, of land, etc. surplus aurln^ the period of the agreement. Article 8 . Artesian wells. I understand from Lefroy that the A.P.O.C. think it very unlikely that wells if sunk will proauce fresn water. But here again I gather that the point is not one of vital importance and that they are likely, if the Sheikh presses the matter, to agree to his request. Article 9 . I gather that no special difficulty arises over this. Article 10 . Imports to he free, but right to re-export to be covered by a special payment additional to royalty. This, I gather, will be a bargaining point, and attention is invited in connection with it to the Sheikh's demands in respect of Article 15 as set out in the summary of the telegram from Qatar dated 2nd March in the A.P.O.C. summary. Article 11. I understand that the A.P.O.C. see no special difficulty about this. Article 12/- 4 - Article 12 o This proviso that transferee companies shall be subject to approval hy the sheikh, coupled with the intimation on the same Article in the telegram from c^atar of 2nd March that only one subsidiary company will be permitted, is, I gather, taken rather seriously by the A.P.O.C., who are, of course, bound to transfer to the I»P#C. any concession which they may obtain. The question was not discussed in any detail with Lefroy, but I gathered they have in mind the possibility of establishing a Qatar Oil Company which would be a subsidiary of the I,p.C# and to which the concession could be transferred to be worked, with the sheikh's approval, once it had been obtained by the A»P.O»C, Article 15 . I gather that the Company have in mind a variation of the Sheikh's counter suggestion on this to the elfect that termination will be possible only within three years of the date of the agreement (which is, of course, a very different thing from the date of the commencement of operations). I pointed this out to Leiroy, but did not go beyond that in our conversation. The sheikh can be relied on to look after his own interests on this. Article 14. It seems desirable that both we and the A.P*O.C. should see the redraft, though if it is a 'redraft/u - 5 - 'redraft without alteration of the sense' no special difficulty need he anticipated. Article 15 . I gather that the Company agree. Article 16 of telegram of 36th February. From the telegram of 28th February you will see that the Sheikh has now agreed to the retention of the refertnce to the Political Resident. Article 1 7. The Company, I gather from Lefroy, do not at all like this and feel that if the sheikh is to he at liberty to disapprove of 'any employee' and if the Company are thereupon to he hound to dismiss hiin ? they may find themselves in a difficult position. I said that here, as elsewhere, it seemed desirable for the Company, if they wished to get this concession, to meet the Saeikh on all points that were not entirely fundamental, but that possibly they might think it v/orth while asking IVy lies to get a rather clearer definition from the sheikh of the precise type of employee to whom he wished to be in a position to object He might wish for a completely free hands he might, on the other hand, be chiefly concerned to be able to object to individual Arabs or other native employees. I gather that the Company will probably do this. Article 18/ll - 5 - Article 18 . Here, as In the case of Articles 1 and 14, it seems desirable that H.k.G. and the A.P.O.C. should see the redraft, so as to ensure that there Is In fact no alteration of sense. Article 21 . As the result of discussion with the Company it has already been agreed that as the sheikh apparently knows only Arabic and has nobody In his service who has a fluent knowledge of English, there are special reasons for allowing the Arabic text to prevail. 2. question of local refinery . The demand for a local refinery (which woula have been very acceptable to the Admiralty) appears to have been dropped (compare telegram of 28th February on Article 16 from Qatar). 3. Telegram from oatar of 2nd Iwarch . Article 11 . I said to Lefroy that the company, under the terms of this article, were already required to pay the wages of the guards who were to be appointed in consultation with the sheikh; that the sheikh under the terms of his Treaty was precluded from obtaining arms, save with the approval of H.M.G., but that H.M.G. would raise no objection to arms (after consultation with the Political Resident, being imported In sufficient quantities to equip the guards, but for no other purpose, so long as this/' 7 ■ • this was done through the proper channels. Article 15 . I gather that the Company see no difficulty ahout fo rce majeu re involving delay of operations in Qatar only. We see no objection to payment in rupees. The question of annual payments in addition to royalty to cover exemption from customs duties, etc. and the right to re-export is a matter for 'bargaining. 4. As regards the substantial gift, I gather (though Lefroy will not probably wish to be quoted) that iWicmrs, which are thought to emanate from Holmes, have been spread locally, the most moderate of which is to the effect th-t the sheikh of Koweit received 45,000 rupees as a personal gift on the -conclusion of his contract, and that this has sent up the sheikh of Qatar's demands. The Company are, it appears, prepared to consider a substantial gift rather on Qatar lines. It is most satisfactory that the Company should obtain an extension of the option until 4th May. 6- The Company appear to be a good deal disturbed about Holmes' alleged contacts with the sheikh. Lefroy mentioned (again I am not sure that he will wish to be quoted) that it had been ascertained throuji the local postal authorities that a letter addressed by Holmes to the sheikh had been received in Qatar and that other letters/- 8 - letters addressed to the sheikh had heen received from Mohamed Yattirn. They attach great importance to preventing him from visiting Qatar if, as Ivylies remarks in his telegram, 'repetition of the Koweit experience is to he avoided'. 7. i am sending a copy of this letter to the political Agent, Bahrein and to the Government of India. Yours sincerely, J. G • LAITHWAITE •jirom (^at r. N o . 2, 26 th February . The following is the result of negotiations to date. The Shaikh has raised all the points and several others raised with Chisholm see his letter of 1st November 1933, and claims he is free to do so in view of Chisholm's letter of 17th December and that he gave no reason to suppose that he would modify his demands with regard to the general terms even if the cash offer was accepted. I am insisting upon obtaining his final demand with general terms before discussing his present cash demands. Article 1 he requires to be redrafted in the same general sense. Period depends entirely upon financial terms. Reports on demand. Royalty basis to be won and saved as in previous Shaikh requires copies of our records on demand. _ All imports are to be through Dohah only, port of export is to be agreed and the Shaikh is to have full right to utilise all facilities whenever necessary for personal or Government business. Aircraft agreed subject to having special permission on each occasion. Article 7. ITo Government pressure with regard to the acquisition of land etc. Land etc. surplus during the period of the agreement reverts to the Shaikh free of cost. Article 8. Shaikh requires two artesian wells free. Articlc 9. Actual requirements only without right to re export . Article 10.

Arabic text only to prevail. Article 22 . Shaikh accepts. An additional article is to provide for a local refineryj discussions continue but I anticipate that the foregoing are the Shaikh's minimum demands and will not be reduced by considerations of cash. When I have obtained his final demands I will write fully to London and proceed to badan for discussion. Meantime telegraph your views for guidance. Te le^rnm received 27th from Abadan . It is certain that Major Frank Holmes is in communication with Shaikh of Qatr to whom he has submitted definite proposals with the Shaikh is using as a counter to ours without disclosing the source, he has already applied to the Shaikh for permission to visit Q.atr but has been refused until the date of expiry of our option. It is essential to prevent Holmes visiting Qatr if a repetition of the Kuwait experience is to be avoided. Telegram received f rom Q. atr 28th February » Article 16. Shaikh accepts Political Resident with the qualification that he also will approve of the Resident's nominee and has dropped the demand for a local refinery.

The Shaikh has told Mylles that Holmes had written suggesting that he should come to Qatr secretly and make him an offer. The Shaikh saia that he had not replied as he was not like Ahmed of Kuwait but liked to do things openly. A reply was sent through Nasir al Mana' to the effect that the Sheikh did not approve his coming to Qatr in disguise, and did not agree that if he came to terms with us he was to withhold his signature for two months to enable Holmes to make an offer, 'but he did agree to Holmes coming to Qatr immediately our option expired (i.e. now after May 4th) if he had not already come to terms with us, and that he would give Holmes preference over us in any subsequent negotiations- Nasir al Mana' asked Holmes to send his proposals in writing at once, as he and his cousin Saleh could guarantee to get the Shaikh to consider them and delay coming to terms with us until the option expired. The Shaikh's initial comments on our draft were largely not in the local Arabic but in modern and up-to-date Egyptian Arabic, and contain words and phrases unknown in Qatr. This was confirmed by Mylles' Arabic-speaking clerk who/2, who was 'born and bred in Cairo. You are doubtless aware that Holmes has all his translations and printing done in Cairo through a man named Hammond. I told you of the redraft which Mirza Mohammed had produced of the form in which our last draft would be used by Arabs of the Shaikh of Qatr's type, and I enclose two copies of this draft, which is quite interesting as its contents seem just as effective as our English drafting- Yours, &amp;c., (Sgd.) L. LkPROY.P.Z. 1783/35, In the name of God the Merciful, the Compassionate, The reason for writing the deed of agreement is: That ^Ve, Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim ath-Thani Ruler of Qatr, on my own behalf and on behalf of my successors and assigns, and I, Charles Clark Hylles, agent for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Ltd. have consented and agreed to conclude this Agreement for a full period of Seventy Five Years on the conditions set forth hereafter: and that the agreement has been completed between us on principles of good will and good faith, both of us praying God for success and relying on Him for help.

Ldylles returned yesteraay afternoon hy air, and I enclose three copies of a translation hy Mirza Mohaffimed of the araft Vt /hich the Shaikh of Qatr gave Ivylles 'before leaving, as representing the Shaikh's views on the general terms. The financial terms have not as yet been discussed at all, and from what we can see they are likely to he difiicult, as that old shaikh appears to he a very- obstinate man and equally hard up in present circumstances. I am going through this draft with Allies and thereafter will discuss it with Messrs. Praser and Agnew, end then make an appointment to see you on any points of difficulty, as Utiles must leave next Tuesday to return to (£itr hy air. As lar as my personal views are concerned, after going through the draft with lilies the point on which I find most difficulty is the second paragraph of Article 18 relating to the submission of differences between foreign employees of the Company and inhabitants oi Q^tr to the shara Courts in Qatr. Article 22 required a Fetwa of the (^adhi before the shaikh was aole to accept so irreligious a conception.

Note of discussion at the India Office on Thursday, 28th March 1935, with representatives of the A .P.O.C. The Sheikh of Qatar's redraft of the Qatar Coimnercial Agreement received under Mr. Lefroy's letter of 26th March to Mr. Laithwaite was discussed at the 1.0. on the 28th March. Mr. Lefroy, Mr. Mylles, Mr. Walton and Mr.Laithwaite were present. 2. It appeared that the Company, (subject to the comments which follow), were prepared generally to accept the redraft in the form proposed 'by the Sheikh, and were in fact anxious to agree to it with as few alterations as possible in order to facilitate negotiations. Article i-u The Sheikh had insisted on 'won and saved'. The redraft of this article on which the Company propose to instruct Mr. Mylles to negotiate is appended to this record. Article U(a) . It has already been agreed (Mr. Lefroy*s ^ K f0?( VO letter of 10th October 1934, on P.Z. 6327/34) that signature must be ad referendum and subject to the approval of H.M.G. The point was made that in these circumstances it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the Company to make the first payment under the agreement immediately on signature. After discussion the best course seemed to be that Mr. Mylles should, immediately before signature and after the financial terms had been agreed, remind the Sheikh that signature was subject to approval and that in these circumstances the whole of the first payment could not be made immediately but that a payment on account of, say, Rs«50,000 would be made at once. and that the date of signature for the purpose of Articles Mb), U(c) and sub-paragraph 2 (i) and (ii) should be the date on/¥ 2. on which the concession had been signed, subject to the approval 01 H • M• G• !( Article 11 . The Company while desiring not to make a difficulty in their negotiations Dy raising an objection were somewhat apprehensive that the Sheikh might endeavour to Bocure armaments on an unjustifiable scale from them with a s view to equipping his forces with machine guns, armoured cars, etc. for the purpose of repelling raids. ^ey would of course be most reluctant to involve themselves in any such commitment, not least because any provision of arms by the Company might expose them to international criticism. It was agreed after discussion that having regard to the provisions of Article 3 of the Qatar Treaty of 1916 and the fact that the question of what provision of arms, etc. was 'sufficient' was open to reference to arbitration, the Company could probably take the risk involved in accepting the Sheikh's redraft as it stood, ^ Article 16 , Provision that the Sheikh's consent should be necessary to the third arbitrator. It was agreed to mention this point to the Political Resident. Mr. Mylles felt confident that the Sheikh (or his son) would in practice agree to whatever name the Resident suggested. The history of this proviso was largely that the Sheikh thought that its insertion would make it less likely that the Resident would nominate someone who would be entirely unacceptable to the Sheikh and under the influence of the Company. Article 17 . The question was raised of what action H.M.G. would take if the Sheikh, for some frivolous reason, were to require the removal of the Chief Local Representative. It was thought that this risk was one which could probably be faced. in practice it might prove necessary in such an event ^o bring political pressure to bear upon the Sheikh.

Sub-paragraph 2. This was discussed in detail. ^r. j..lylles stated that he had informed the Sheikh that the matter was one for H.-.G. , into which the Company could not enter; that the Sheikh had taken the line that it had better go in the agreement -and that if H .Li. G. objected they could then ta^ce it up with him (the Sheikh). The Company were strongly opposed to the acceptance of any such provision and were given to understand that it was obj ect ionabOx aa.so froiii tne point of view of H.Ll.G . who certainly could not agree to it. It wa^ ajreed that .Jr. .:ylles should inform tne Sheikh that the matter had been referred to Government, Oat tnat so far as the concession was concerned the Company could not accept a provision on these lines. The India Ox^i^e representatives intimated that the question of cession of Jui'isdiction oy the Sheikh and a consequent Order in Council would oe taken up, the main alternative courses of procedure being; (a) that the issue should be faced with the Shei -—- condition of the grant of approval by H.L l. G.; (b) that it should be taken up at once TDrior to signature of the concession, the Sheikh being informed that H.M.G. could not approve the insertion of such a condition in any concession. Mr. Mylles remarked t that the shara Law and tho penalties under it were strictly enforced in (^atar and that the point was ■ uf\t therefore one of importance. 3. The Company stated that if they failed to reach ■m . . .... agreement with the Sheikh v/ithin the time of the present option they proposed to withdraw Mr. Llylles and make no application for a further option. They thought on the whole that the Sheikh and his son (who was playing an increasingly important part) were not predisposed to the Company and that they thought tnat they could expect greater support from K. j I. G. with a British concessionnaire. But the Sheikh's financial demands were extravagant. They had no information as/as to who might 'be behind Major Holmes, but thought it probable that it was the Eastern and General Syndicate again. Xhey thought it most unlikely that he was acting in any way on behalf of the Standard. The chances of the latter had not been improved by Ibn Saud's raising the boundary question, which had stiffened the Sheikh's attitude. 4. The Company's representatives enquired what the attitude of H.k.G. would be if negotiations now broke down and if the Sheikh subsequently intimated his desire to grant the concession to another company on less favourable terms than had been offered by the A.P.O.C. It was pointed out to than that the attitude of H.M.G. to any fresh competitor must depend largely on circumstances; that there were great difficulties in urging the Sheiich to give the A.P.O.u. what would in effect be a continuing ontion on the concession on whatever terms they were at this stage prepared to offer; but that in t-rie xirst p^ace, so far a the Standard of California were concerned, it seemed most unlikely that an American Company would be prepared to accept the British safeguards which the Sheikh was aware were a sine qua non of H.M.G.'8 approval to the grant ol i n ■■ ■ —' any concession, while so far as other companies who mifdit comply with these conditions were concerned there seemed no reason why the SheiKh, if his negotiations with A.P.O.C. broke down on the question of finance, should be prepared to accept less favourable terms from another company. The 'British safeguards' would of course be of universal application. India Office, 28th March, 1935.(B&gt; p.

The Shaikh shall not hold the Company liable if ^^fault should occur on the part of the Company in carrying out or fulfilling the provisions of the Agreement by the mere occurence of i force majeure delaying operation^ but should any difference occur between His Excellency the Shaikh and the Company as to the t exi stence or non-existence of such force majeure, the same shall ber gferred to arbitration^ as provided for in the sixteenth article, ^.nd the Shaikh stipulates that the force majeure delaying operation me ans that which occurs in connection v/ith the Company's operations in Qatr and that nothing else must be taken into consideration and must not be used by the Company as an argument in this respect. And the Company shall proceed to effect repairs at the time when any damage, of any nature, takes place; and the period of the said delay, together with any period reasonably necessary for repairing the damage will be added to the period fixed in accordance v/ith this Agreement. Article Sixteenth. Should any dispute occur between the Shaikh and the Company in regard to the interpretation of this Agreement or of any matter arising therefrom or in regard to the engagements obligatory on either of the parties in accordance therewith, such dispute shall be referred to two arbitrators if no Agreement can be arrived at for settling it by any other method, and the Shaikh will appoint one of them and the other will be appointed by the Company. Each of the two parties shall appoint his arbitrator within thirty days after receiving the demand therefor from the other party. The two arbitrators shall thereupon appoint a third arbitrator; but if the two arbitrators or any two arbitrators appointed instead of them are unable to agree upon the third arbitrator within sixty days from the demand for arbitration, the two parties agree that, in that case, the third arbitrator should be appointed by the Political Resident; and the Shaikh makes it a condition that he should agree to the third arbitrator. ^ The award of arbitration shall be consistent with the legal principles familiar to civilized nations. The decision of the majority of arbitrators shall be final; and the place of arbitration shall be Qatr. On giving any award, the arbitrators shall fix a sufficient time within which the party against whom the award is given, should carry out the said award. And that party shall be considered at fault only when he fails to comply with the award before the expiry■ 9. I'? of the aforesaid period and not otherwise. Seventeenth.

And the Shaikh prescribes as a condition the dismissal of any employed whose retention is disapproved by the Shaikh, if the Shaikh has observed any irregular conduct on his part. And it naturally follows that the wages which the Company pays to the employees from amongst Qatr people shall be reasonable. Article Eighteenth. The Shaikh and the Companv declare that thev base action upon this Agreement on the basis of good faith and pure belief and upon the interpretation of this Agreement in a manner consistent with reason. And the Company undertakes to acknowledge the Shaikh's authority and his rights in his capacity as the Ruler of the State of Qatr principality and to respect them in every manner. Article Nineteentho Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Shaikh in any manner v/hatsoever from granting concessions to other parties for anything excepting the substances mentioned in the first article provided that the said concessions do not interfere with the rights of the Company or its operations in accordance with this Agreement. Article Twentieth. The Company will pay all the sums due to the Shaikh, in accordance with this Agreement, into the Shaikh's account in the Bank in and the receipt taken from that Bank shall be a full acquittance of the Company's liability for the sum mentioned in the Bank 's receipt. The Shaikh may, from time to time, appoint another Bank or other Banks for the purposes of this Article, and this shall be done in writing. A rticle Twentv-First. This Agreement shall be binding upon both the Parties and their successors and assigns? and it has oeen written in Arabic and English and all due care has been taken to make the twop 10. texts identical in meaning. And if any difference should arise as to the meaning or the interpretation of any article, at any time., the Arabic version is to be relied upon. jrtinle Twenty -Second.

I enclose 6 copies of a draft dated 29th March 1935 which Mylles took out with him. The top copy I have had marked in pencil to show any variations from the original text as circulated of Mirza Mohammed's translation of the Shaikh's draft, which we discussed with you on the 28th March, Article i\. has been inserted into this draft in the form of the draft which I left with you on the 28th. In Article 11 the words 'for this and the cost of their arms' have 'been deleted at Mr. Eraser's wish; the deletion is one of form rather than substance, since if we require 'armed guards' we do not expect to obtain them at the ordinary rate of wages to labourers - equally we do not propose to pay for a small army at the Shaikh's sole discretion. In Article 18 we have deleted, in accordance with your wishes, the provision as to trial of 'foreign employees' of the Company in the Shara courts, but otherwise the .changes are I think in every case purely verbal. Yours sincerely, L. LEPROY.DRAFT /&gt; ill (IU 29. ^ This Agreement was made on the day of 1 95 } corresponding to the ^5 between His Excellency Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim al-Thani, Ruler of Qatr, (who is hereinafter called 'the Shaikh', and this expression, whenever the contract requires shall include his successors and assigns), on the one part, and Charles Clark Mylles, on behalf of the Anglo-Persian Oil Co„Ltd.

And neither does the Shaikh guarantee to the Company what may be caused by unforeseen circumstances, nor will he be responsible therefor. For instance should, God forbid, an attack be made by an enemy or any accident occurs in spite of him, through any aggressor, the Shaikh shall, in case of such aggression, use his endeavour to ward off an aggression of this nature; but he shall I not be responsible for any loss or damage thereby caused.

The Shaikh shall not hold the Company liable if | default should occur on the part of the Company in carrying out or I I fu ^ fi lling the provisions of the Agreement by the mere occurence of ■ force ma jeure delaying operation; but should any difference occur | between His Excellency the Shaikh and the Company as to the Xl stence or non-existence of such force majeure, the same shall bereferred to arbitration, as provided for in the sixteenth article. And the Shaikh stipulates that the force majeure delaying operation means that which occurs in connection with the Company's operations in Qatr and that nothing else must be taken into consideration and must not be usee by the Company as an argument in this respect. And the Company shall proceed to effect repairs at the time when any damage, of any nature, takes place; and the period of the said delay, together with any period reasonably necessary for repairing the damage will be added to the period fixed in accordance v/ith this Agreement. Article Sixteenth. Should any dispute occur between the Shaikh and ^the Company in regard to the interpretation of this Agreement or of any matter arising tnerefrom or in regard to the engagements obligatory on either o^ che parties in accordance therewith, such dispute shall be referred to two arbitrators if no Agreement can be arrived at for settling it by any other method, and the Shaikh will appoint one of them and the other will be appointed by the Company. Each of the two parties shall appoint his arbitrator within thirty days after receiving the demand therefor from the other party. The two arbitrators shall thereupon appoint a third arbitrator; but if the two arbitrators or any two arbitrators appointed instead of them are unable to agree upon the third arbitrator within sixty days from the demand for arbitration, the two parties agree that, in that case, the third arbitrator should be appointed by the Political Resident; and the Shaikh makes it a condition that he should agree to the third arbitrator. The award of arbitration shall be consistent with the legal principles familiar to civilized nations. The decision of the majority of arbitrators shall be final; the place of arbitration shall be Qatr. On giving any award, the arbitrators shall fix a sufficient ^ime within which the party against whom the award is given, should Carry ou t the said award. And that party shall be considered at fclUl t only when he fails to comply with the award before the expiryof the aforesaid period and not otherwise. ^ele _Seventeenth. The labourers employed by the Company must be rron. amongst the Shaikh's own subjects or from amongst those approved by the Shaikh, excepting technical employees and the managers and clerks whom the Company may require and whom it cannot find in the country. Ana the ohaikh prescribes as a condition the dismissal of any employe®'whose retention is disapproved by the Shaikh, if the Shaikh has observed any irregular conduct on his part. And it naturally follows that the wages which the Company pays to the euployees from amongst Qatr people shall be reasonable. Article Eighteenth. The Shaikh and the Company declare that they pase action upon this Agreement on the basis of good faith and pure ! belief and upon the interpretation of this Agreement in a manner consistent with reason. And the Company undertakes to acknowledge the Shaikh's authority and his rights in his capacity as the Ruler of the State of Qatr PT-inxri |&gt;h 1 I l.,y : and to respect them in every manner Article—Nineteentl 'i- „ Nothing contained in this Agreement shall | pxevent the Shaikh in any manner v/hatsoever Trom granting concessions to other parties for anything excepting the substances, mentioned in j the first article provided that the said concessions do not interfere j with the rights of the Company or its operations in accordance with this Agreement o I Article Twentieth.

The expression year, month and day used in this Agreement shall mean what is consistent with the English Solar Calendar and not any other. IN WITNESS whereof the two parties have hereunto set their hands and seals on the day and in the year mentioned in the preamble.

The following appears to be the position of the outstanding points: ARTICLE 11., The Sheikh is still determined to w ^ e + Cost of arrns out of us some- now, buc assures me we can come to terms on the point; I don 't quite see ho^ vhis can be done however. The oheikh is inclined to agree to take out of the concession the - J 01 ' the F lal of foreigners VP does so he states he win withhold his signature until he has agreed with H .m .G. that the trial of foreigners in Qatr shall take place in his and the Shaia 1 Courts and fail ing such an agreement, he farther states that he win not sign any concession. It appears to me that the time is not far distant when H.M.G. should make clear to the Sheikh their policy in both matters viz: the provision of arms and the Jurisdiction over foreigners.

J.G. Laithwaite, Esq., C.I.E., India Office, 3 o ■ v • 1 • Dear Laittiwaite, Ivylles telegraplis from r^tr that, as a result of an informal meeting, the shaikh is still insisting upon a specific provision for payment for arms, and if the provision for jurisdiction of the shara Courts over foreigners is removea from the concession ne will refuse to sign until Government agree to nis aemanas. Utiles states that tn.^ siiaikn regaras these two ooints as vital to his independence as a ruler. We understand from Iviylles that the political Resident is due to-morrow at Dohah, ana that Mylles has also informed the Political Agent at Bahrein that the time appears ripe for a declaration hy HAG.of their policy to the shaikh. If in that declaration H.M.G. coula definitely inform the shaikh that they would not approve of a concession to any party providing specifically for the purchase of arms for the shaikh, ana for the jurisaiction oi the shara courts over foreigners, we feel that the position shoula he materially assisted. In that event we woula tell My lies to go aheaa and endeavour to clear up trie financial position, since in the absence of any reference to this it woula look as if Ivylles haa not yet got to a aiscussion of casn. He is however to have a formal meeting with tne shaikh to-day if the Shaikh's health permits, and it is likely that the first question aiscussed was 'Have you brought hack an acceptance of all rry requirements?'. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) L. LEPROY. P«3i Following my conversation with you this afternoon we have instructed JViylles to represent to the political Resident on arrival our objections to specific provisions for the purchase of arms, ana to obtain the ResiaenVs support on this point. Ivlylles has further been reminded that he can count on the Resident's support on the jurisdiction question. L.PrTelegram xx From Political Resident, Buehire. To Secretary of state for India, London Repeated Government of India, Simla. Copy by post to I-olitical ngent, Bahrain. No.372. Dated the 22nd April i935. Hesult tu three days long conversations with Shaikh of ^atar has been as follows. ,''f- ,Lf !• With regard to concluding paragraph of your telegram of 16th April No.1208. l/fcrllee does not anticipate trouble ii\ settling this with Shaikh and to latter I explained t ide, i-t was ior him and the Company to come to a^jreemant on the number of guards necessary. Shaikh himself drew attention to Article III of Treaty. 2. With reference to external protection (vide paragr%&gt;h 3 of my u^ress Letter No.C-179 of 6th April 1934) Shaikh now asked in writing (a) whether His l^jesty^ Government would guarantee him protection from invaders of any sort (b) what actual measures His Majesty f s Government would adopt. Object of Shaikhs query appeared to be to satisfy himself that in case oi necessity His Majesty's Govemaent meant business. 3. I replied verbally (a) that guarantee was against all comers but naturally referred to serious incursions not small raids. This the Shaikh /(1) / (b) Shaikh 'thought reasonable. That doubtless His Msj esV' a Goverment would use aircraft and othur suits a® msans which appeared to impresa him. 4. On this point 1 suggest 1 be authorised to reply in writing as In 3 ( a ) snd (b) adding in order that assistance if necessary may reach him quickly landing grounds and w/t installation will of course be necessary in his territory as well as collaborstion with him in obtaining ear^ Information of impending raids. This will cover Royal *ir Force intelligence arrangenen ,s though 1 do not think it advisable at this stsge speciiicaliy to mention Intelligence Officers. - - with reference to your telegram Ko.1127 of 8th a^ril* jurisdiction# ShaiJfch for some time persisted in his previL-iiS demand but finally gave me a letter in which he said he would agree to (a) disputes between British subjects British protected subjects and the subjects of non-Moslem Foreign Powers being settled by the r olitical Agent Bahrain or his representative (b) disputes of British subjects and subjects of non-Moslem Foreign cowers with his own subjects andl with the subjects of Moslem Foreign Powers being settled by a Joint Court at Doha on which he and the Political Agent or their representatives woulc sit provided that His Majesty^ Government on their pL.rt unaertook to (1) recognise his son Hamad as his heir apparent (2) accora himself and Hamad when the latter succeeded him full support in internal matters. 6. With regard to paragreph 6 (b).-3- (1) Shaikh excluded 3ritish protected subjects and explai ed verbally that while he wished subjects ot Kuwait Bahi*ain and Trucla.1 Coast to come unaer his jurisdiction all other British protected subjects would come under the Joint Court* (2) He added in his letter that with regard to subjects of Moslem Foreign i ov&lt;ere he would not be responsible for ai^r objection nhich might be raised by their Governments. 7 (aO Rei 5 (1). previous recognition of any particular heir of any Shaikh is againet policy of Government• (b) Re:6(2)# This is objectionable as it would involve us to some extent in internal administration of ^atar and in supporting Shaikh and in his turn Hamad in any mal administration which the^ might see fit to carry out ana for which we would bear the responsibility and odium. This clause has undoubtedly been inserted by Hamad who is most unpopular in ^atar. (c) Re:6(l)#I do not think that we can meet Shaikh on this point as inter £lia effect would be bad on the other Arab Rulers whose subjects were concerned. 1 imagine that wain reason for this exclusion on the p* rt of Shaikh is to avoid his subjects oeing sued | for debt in the Doha Joint Court by subjects of other Arab Rulers expecially Bahrain. b. 1 auggeet that I be authorised to write a let er o the Shaikh to the following effect; (a) /78 ; -4- (a) that Hie Majeety's Government agree to a Joint Court at Doha but that as the Shaikh wUl realise we cannot elisoriminate between our protected subjects on Arab Coast and others and all such subjects must come under the jurisdiction of the Joint Court• (b) that recognition of Hamad cannot be given ss such is against the general policy of Government. (c) that His Majesty's Government cannot accord general support in internal matters since this would involve an undesirable measure of interference in his administration.

Ihe Air Ministry attach much importance to the question of air facilities referred to in the last paragraph of Firie's letter and in particular to being free to pay occasional visits by aircraft without previous warning, so as to ensure that air facilities are being properly maintainea and to enable the pilots to become familiar with the country, especially in the vicinity oi the frontier.

My dear Laithwaite, With reference to the draft telegram to Powle wion legara to the conclusion of an agreenient v^ith the Sheikh Ox Qpitar in return for the agreement of an oil concession to the A.P .CV3., one gets the impression that Powle is offering to the sheikh a guarantee of unlimited protection which, as you will appreciate, we could not possioly implement. We know, of course, that in point of fact tnis is far from being so ana that Fowle fully understands the position in this respect ana is acting in accordance with your telegrams 583 and 585 of the ^nd Iviarch 1934, to him, since when he has also seen the Air Council letter 3*32797 of the 19th Iviarch 1934&gt; so we feel confident that he himself is fully in the picture. Nevertheless we would de grateful if in your reply to him, you qualified paragraph 2 by adding words to the effect tnat you presume he has impressed on the Sheikh that the limited guarantee of protection which H.Iw.G. are offering would not absolve him from taking all possible measures to provide from his own resources for his own defence and for maintaining order within his own boundaries. As I mentioned to you on the telephone, we feel tharu might be a real risk of the sheikh tacitly assuming tnat he need no longer bother about defence, and of/ Laithwaite, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S#W. 1.—— «- 2 - of relying entirdly on lor protection. Wa ho pa also that PowIj will takj such steps as ha thinks hest to acquaint the shaikh with the air facilities tnat wd would require him to provide if our guarantee of protection is to he of any value to him, (these were enumerated in your telegram 585 of the 2nd Larch 1934) ana with the importance of permitting occasional visits hy aircraft without previous warning, to ensure that the air facilities arc, being properly maintained ana to ^nahle thu pilots to become familiar with the country ^specially in tho- vicinity of tne frontier.

In confirmation of our telephone conversation this afternoon, a telegram came in last night from Mylles stating that agreement had 'been reached within the limits of his financial discretions, but that the Shaikh of Qatr wished to delay signature until agreement had 'been reached between himself and His Majesty's Government, For the present the Shaikh was not fit for further discussion, hut a doctor was exx^ected today. In addition to the straightforward financial provisions we have accepted a liability to bear the expenses of two representatives of the Shaikh in Qatr if necessary, with salaries which are to be reasonable and suitable to their position and duties. V/e have furthermore sanctioned grants of considerable quantities of free petrol and kerosene to the Shaikh during the currency of the Agreement# We telegraphed today to Mylles reminding him oi the arrangements made with you, under which when he signs it mus u be subject to the approval of His Majesty's Government. Furthermore, after signature copies of the Concession and letter of reservation are to be sent to the Resident. Mylles has informed us of the salutary effects of the Resident's recent visit to Qatr, but did not mention the Government/* -|MiiiiiTiiTrT iiiii inn r* \ 7 2. r Government/Company Agreement, so I expect that the Resident thought that with jurisdiction and other difficult questions there was enough debatable matter for the moment with the shaikh, and as we originally arranged will show the Shaikh the Government/Company Agreement after some concession has been signed.
