ChaptelR I.—Provisions to be observed by the Governments of Countries Parties to this Convention on the appearance in their Territory of Plague, Cholera, Yellow Fever OR CERTAIN OTHER COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. Section I. —Notification and subsequent Communications to other Countries. Article 1 .—Every Government must immediately notify to the other Govern ments and, at the same time, to the Office International d’Hygiene Publique— (1) The first recognised case of plague, cholera or yellow fever found in its territory’. (2) The first recognised case of plague, cholera or yellow fever which occurs outside the limits of local areas already affected. (3) The existence of an epidemic of typhus or of smallpox. Article 2 .—Every notification prescribed in Article 1 shall be accompanied, or very promptly followed, by detailed information as to— j (1) The place where the disease has appeared; (2) The date of its appearance, its source and its type; (3) The number of known cases and deaths; (4) The extent of the local area or areas affected; (5) Iln the case of plague, the presence of that disease or of unusual mortality among rodents; (6) In the case of cholera, the number of germ carriers when any have been discovered; (7) In the case of yellow fever, the presence and relative prevalence (index) of stegomyia calopus (aedes egypti) ; (8) The measures taken. Article 3. —The notifications prescribed in Articles 1 and 2 shall be supplied to the Diplomatic Missions, or, failing them, to the Consulates in the capital of the infected country, and shall be held at the disposal of consular representatives established in its territory. These notifications shall also be addressed to the Office International d’Hygiene Publique, which shall communicate them immediately to all Diplomatic Missions, or, failing them, to the Consulates in Paris, as well as to the principal public health authorities of the participating countries. Those pres cribed under Article 1 shall be addressed by telegram. , The telegrams addressed by the Office International d’Hygiene Publique to the Governments of countries parties to this Convention or to the principal public health authorities of these countries, and the .telegrams transmitted by these Govern ments and by these authorities under this Convention, are classed as Government telegrams, and are entitled to the priority accorded to such telegrams, by Article 5 of the International Telegraphic Convention of the 10th to 22nd July, 1875., ... I - * '•-'A2 -The notification and information prescribed by Articles 1 and 2 shall be followed by subsequent communications furnished regu larly to the Office International d’Hygiene Publique, so as to keep the Governments informed of the course of the epidemic. These communications shall be as frequent and complete as possible, and as regards the number of Cases and deaths shall be made at least once a week; they shall indicate, in particular, the precautions taken to prevent the spread of the disease, and shall set out with precision the measures adopted in the case of outgoing vessels to prevent exportation of the disease, and especially the measures taken with regard to rodents or insects. -Governments undertake to reply to any request for information which may be made to them by the Office International d’Hygiene Publique in regard to the epedemic diseases men tioned in the Convention, which occur in their territory, and in regard to circumstances likely to affect the transmission of these diseases from one country to another. -Since rats* are the principal agents by which bubonic plague is spread, Governments undertake to make use of all means in their power to diminish this danger and to keep themselves regularly informed of the condition of the rats in their port, as_ regards plague infection, by frequent and systematic exa minations ; in particular, to carry out systematically the bac teriological examination of rats in every plague-infected area, during a period of six months at least from the finding of the last plague-infected rat. The methods and the results of these examinations shall be communicated in ordinary circumstances at regular intervals, and in the case of plague every month, to the Office International d’Hygiene Publique in order that Gov ernments may be kept regularly informed by that Office of the condition of ports in regard to plague amongst rats. On the first discovery of rat plague on land, in a port free from infection during the previous six months, the communica tions shall be sent by the most rapid method. In order to facilitate the fulfilment of its duties under this Convention, and having regard to the benefits derived from the information furnished by the epidemiological intelligence service of the League of Nations, including its Eastern Bureau at Singapore and other analogous bureaux, as well as by the Pan- American Sanitary Bureau, the Office International d’Hygiene Publique is empowered to make necessary arrangements with the Health Committee of the League of Nations, as well as with the Pan-American Sanitary Bureau and other similar organisa tions. It remains understood that the relations established under the above-mentioned arrangements will not involve any deroga tion from the provisions of the Convention of Rome of the 9th December, 1907, and will not have the result of substituting any other sanitary bodv for the Office international d’Hvgiene Publique. Article 8 .—The prompt and scrupulous fulfilment of the foregoing provisions being of primary importance, Governments recognise the neces sity of giving instructions in regard to their application to the appropriate authorities. As notification is of no value unless every Government be itself informed, at the time, of cases of plague, cholera, yellow fever, typhus or smallpox,_ and also of suspected cases of these diseases, which occur in its territory, Governments undertake to make the notification of cases of these diseases compulsory. Article 9 .—It is recommended that neighbouring countries should make special arrangements with the object of organising direct ex change of information between their principal administrative officers, both as regards territories having a common frontier and as regards territories having close commercial relations. These arrangements shall be communicated to the Office Inter national d’Hygiene Publique. * Section II.— Conditions under which the measures 'prescribed by the Convention are applicable or cease to be applicable to arrivals from particular areas. Article 10 .—The notification of imported cases of plague, cholera or yellow fever shall not lead to the adoption of the measures prescribed in Chapter II below in regard to arrivals from the local area in which the disease is present. * The provisions of this Convention regarding rats are applicable to the case of other rodents t and in general to other animals known to be the means of spreading plague. Article 4. Article 5.- Article 6.- Article 7 .—3 But these measures may be adopted when a first case of plague or yellow fever, recognised as a non-imported case, baa occurred, when the cases of cholera form a foyer * or when typhus or small pox exists in epidemic form. Article 11. —In order that the measures prescribed in Chapter II may be limited to places which are actually infected, Governments shall restrict their application to arrivals from defined local areas in which the diseases mentioned in this Convention, have appeared under the conditions indicated in the second paragraph of Article 10 . But this limitation of an infected local area shall be accepted only on the definite condition that the Government of the country in which this area is comprised take the measures necessary (1) for checking the spread of the epidemic and (2) for applying the measures prescribed by Article 13 below. Article 12 .—The Government of any country in which an infected area is situated shall inform other Governments and the Office Inter national d’Hygiene Publique in the manner specified in Article- 3, when the danger of infection from that area has ceased, and when all the preventive measures have been taken. On the receipt of this information the measures prescribed in Chapter II shall no longer be applicable to arrivals from the area in question, except in exceptional circumstances which will require to be justified. Section IIP.— Measures at jJorts and on the departure of vessels. Article IS .-—The competent authority shall take effectual measures: — (1) To prevent the embarkation of persons showing symptoms of plague, cholera, yellow fever, typhus or small-pox, and of persons in such relations with the sick as to render them liable to transmit the infection of these diseases; (2) In the case of plague, to prevent rats gaining access to ships; (3) In the case of cholera, to see that drinking water and foodstuffs taken on board are wholesome, and that water taken in as ballast is disinfected if necessary; ^ (4) In the case of yellow fever, to prevent mosquitoes gaining access to ships; (5) In the case of typhus, to secure the delousing of all suspects before their embarkation; (6) In the case of smallpox, to disinfect old clothes and rags before they are baled. j Article 14. —Governments undertake to maintain in their large ports and in their surroundings, and as far aa possible in the other ports and their surroundings, sanitary services possessing an organisation and equipment capable of carrying out the application of the prophylactic measures in regard to the diseases mentioned in this Convention, and especially the measures laid down in Articles 6, 8 and 13. The said Governments shall supply at least once a year to the Office International d’Hygiene Publique a statement showing in the case of each of their ports the condition of its sanitary organisation having regard to the provisions of the preceding paragraph. The Office shall forward such information by appropriate means to the principal health authorities of the participating countries, either directly or indirectly through another international sanitary organisation in accordance with the arrangements conchided under Article T. Chapter IT.— Measures of Defence against the Diseases MENTIONED IN CHAPTER I. Article 15 .—Any ship, whatever its port of departure, may be subjected by the sanitary authority to a medical inspection, and if circum stances require it, to a thorough examination. The sanitary measures or procedure to which a ship may be subjected on arrival shall be determined by the actual condi tion found to exist on board and the medical history of the voyage. * A “foyer” exists when the occurrence of new cases outside the immediate surroundings of the first cases proves that the spread of the disease has not been limited to the place where it began.I . - ; ■ 4- It rests with each Government, taking into account the information furnished under the provisions of Section I of Chapter I and of Article 14 of this Convention, as well as the obligations it has undertaken under Section II of Chapter I, to determine what procedure should be applicable in its own ports to arrivals from any foreign port, and in particular to decide whether, from the point of view of the procedure to be applied, a particular foreign port should be considered as infected. The measures as laid down in this Chapter shall be regarded as constituting a maximum within the limits of which Govern ments may regulate the procedure which may be applied to ships on their arrival. Section I.— Notification of Measures prescribed. Article 16. —Every Government undertakes to communicate immediately to the Diplomatic Mission or, failing that, to the Consul of the infected country, residing in its capital, as well as to the Office International d’Hygiene Publique, which shall at once bring them to the notice of other Governments, the measures which they consider necessary to prescribe with regard to arrivals from that country. Such information shall be held at the disposition of other diplomatic or consular representatives established in its territory* They also undertake to make known, through the same channels, the withdrawal of these measures or any modifications thereof. In the absence of a Diplomatic Mission or a Consulate in the capital, the communications shall be made direct to the Government of the country concerned. Section II 1 .— Merchandise and Baggage.—Importation and Transit. Article 17. —Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Article 50, the entry of merchandise and baggage arriving by land or by sea for import or for transit may not be prohibited nor may merchandise or baggage be detained at frontiers or in ports. The only measures which may be prescribed with regard to such merchandise and baggage are specified in the following para graphs : —- (a) In the case of plague, body linen and wearing apparel recently worn and bedding that has been in recent use may be subjected to disinsectisation, and, if necessary, to disinfection. Merchandise coming from an infected local area and likely to harbour plague-infected rats may be unloaded only on condi tion that the precautions necessary to prevent the escape of rats and to ensure their destruction are taken as far as practicable. (b) In the case of cholera, body linen and wearing apparel recently worn and bedding that has been in recent use may be subjected to disinfection. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article, the import ation of fresh fish, shell-fish and vegetables may be prohibited unless they have undergone a treatment calculated to destroy cholera vibrios. (c) In the case of typhus, body linen and wearing apparel recently worn and bedding which has been in recent use, as well as rags not carried as merchandise in bulk, may be subjected to dis insectisation. (d) In the case of smallpox, body linen and wearing apparel recently worn and bedding which has been in recent use, as well as rags not carried as merchandise in bulk, may be subjected to dis infection. Article 18. —It rests with the authority of the country of destination to decide in what manner and at wdiat place disinfection shall be carried out and what methods shall be adopted to secure the destruction of rats or insects (fleas, lice, mosquitoes, &amp;c.). These operations shall be performed in such a manner as to injure articles as little as possible. Clothes and other articles of small value, including rags not carried as merchandise in bulk, may be destroyed by fire. It is the duty of each State to settle questions relative to the payment of compensation for any damage caused by dis infection, deratisation or disinsectisation, or by tke destruction of the articles referred to above.5 If, on account of these measures, charges are levied by the sanitary authority, either directly or indirectly through a com pany or an individual, the rates of these charges shall be in accordance with a tariff published in advance and so drawn up that the State or the sanitary authority may not, on the whole, derive any profit from its application. Article 19. —Letters and correspondence, printed matter, books, newspapers, business documents, &amp;c., shall not be subject to any sanitary measure. Parcels conveyed by post shall be subjected to rest riction only if their contents include articles to which the measures set out in Article IT of this Convention are applicable. Article 20. —When merchandise or baggage has been subjected to the opera tions prescribed in Article 17, any interested party can require the sanitary authority to issue a free certificate showing the measures that have been taken. Section III.— Provisions relating to Emigrants. Article 21. —The sanitary authority in a country of emigration shall subject its emigrants to a medical examination before their departure. It is recommended that special arrangements should be made between countries of emigration, of transit, and of immi gration, with a view to laying down the conditions under which this examination shall be considered satisfactory by them, so that rejections on medical grounds at the frontiers of countries of transit and of destination may be reduced to the fewest possible. It is also recommended that these arrangements should lay down the preventive measures against infectious diseases to which emigrants should be submitted in the country of departure. Article 22. —It is recommended that towns or ports of embarkation for emigrants should be provided with an adequate health and sanitary administration, and, m particular: (1) a service for medical examination and treatment, as well as the necessary sanitary and prophylactic equipment; (2) an establishment supervised by the State, where emigrants may be subjected to health formalities, be housed temporarily, undergo all necessary medical examinations and have their food and drinking supplies examined; (3) premises situated at the port where medical examinations at the actual time of embarkation may be made. Article 23 .—It is recommended that emigrant ships should be provided with a sufficient quantity of vaccines (anti-smallpox, anti-cholera, &amp;c.), in order to permit, if necessary, of vaccinations during the voyage. Section IY.— Measures at Ports and Marine Frontiers. (A)— Plague. Article 24. — Infected Ship. A ship shall be regarded as infected— (1) If it has a case of human plague on board; (2) Or if a case of human plague broke out more than six days after embarkation; (3) Or if plague-infected rats are found on board. Suspected Ship. —A ship shall be regarded as suspected — (1) If a case of human plague broke out on board in the first six days after embarkation; ^ (2) Or if investigations regarding rats have shown the existence of an unusual mortality without determining the cause thereof. The ship shall continue to be regarded as suspected until it has been subjected to the measures prescribed by this Convention at a suitably equipped port. Healthy Ship.—jA ship shall be regarded as healthy, not withstanding its having come from an infected port, if there has been no human or rat plague on board either at the time of departure, or during the voyage, or on arrival, and the investi gations regarding rats have not shown the existence of an un usual mortality. Article 25. — Plague-infected ships shall undergo the following measures: — (1) Medical inspection; (2) The sick shall immediately be disembarked and isolated; * In all cases where this Convention provides for “surveillance” the sanitary authority may substitute “observation’’ as an exceptional measure in the case of persons who do not offer adequate sanitary guarantees. Persons under observation or surveillance shall give facilities for all clinical or bacteriological investigations which are considered necessary by the sanitary authority.6 ' 1 ® (3) All persons who have been in contact with the sick and those whom the port sanitary authority have reason to consider suspect shall be disembarked if possible. They may be subjected to observation or surveillance,* or to observation followed by surveillance, provided that the total duration of these measures does not exceed six days from the time of arrival of the ship; Ijt rests with the sanitary authority of the port, after taking into consideration the date of the last case, the condition of the ship and the local possibilities, to apply that one of these measures which seems to them preferable. During the same period the crew may be prevented from leaving the ship except on duty notified to the sanitary authority ; (4) Bedding which has been used, soiled linen, wearing apparel and other articles which, in the opinion of the sanitary authority, are infected shall be disinsected and, if necessary, disinfected; (5) The parts of the ship which have been occupied by persons suffering from plague or which, in the opinion of the sanitary authority, are infected shall be disinsected and, if necessary, disinfected; (6) The sanitary authority may require deratisation before the dis charge of cargo, if they are of opinion, having regard to the nature of the cargo and. the way in which it is loaded, that it is possible to effect a total destruction of rats before discharge. In this case, the ship may not be subjected to a new deratisation after discharge. In other cases the complete destruction of the rodents shall be effected on board when the holds are empty. In the case of ships in ballast, this process shall be carried out as soon as possible before taking cargo ; Deratisation shall be carried out so as to avoid, as far as possible, damage to the ship and cargo (if any). The operation must not last longer than twenty-four hours. Any charges made in respect of these operations of deratisation and any question of compensation for damage shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Article 18. f If a ship is to discharge a part of its cargo only, and if the port authorities consider that it is impossible to carry out com plete deratisation, the said ship may remain in the port for the time required to discharge that part of its cargo, provided that all precautions, including isolation, are taken to the satisfaction of the sanitary authority to prevent rats from passing from the ship to the shore, either during unloading or otherwise. The discharge of cargo shall be carried out under the control of the sanitary authority, who shall take all measures necessary to prevent the staff employed on this duty from becoming infected. This staff shall be subjected to observation or to surveillance for a period not exceeding six days from the time when they have ceased to work at the unloading of the ship. Article 26. — Plague-suspected ships shall undergo the measures specified in (1), (4), (5) and (6) of Article 25. ^ In addition, the crew and passengers may be subjected to surveillance, which shall not exceed six days reckoned from the date of arrival of the ship. .The crew may be prevented during the same period from leaving the ship except on duty notified to the Sanitary Authority. Article 27. — Healthy Ships. —Ships free from plague shall be given free pratique immediately, with the reservation that the sanitary authority of the port of arrival may prescribe the following measures with regard to them : — (1) Medical inspection to determine whether the ship comes within the definition of a healthy ship ; j (2) Destruction of rats on board, under the conditions specified in (6) of Article 25, in exceptional cases and for well-founded reasons, which shall be communicated in writing to the captain of the ship; (3) The crew and passengers may be subjected to surveillance during a period which shall not exceed six days reckoned from the date on which the .ship left the infected port. The crew may be prevented during the same period from leaving the ship except on duty notified to the sanitary authority. Article 28. —All ships, except those employed in national coastal service, shall be periodically derafised, or be permanently so maintained that any rat population is kept down to the minimum. In the first case they shall receive Deratisation Certificates, and in the second, Deratisation Exemption Certificates. ■'■t.'■V. D 7, Governments shall make known through the Office Inter national d’Hygiene Publique those of their ports possessing the- equipment and personnel necessary for the deratisation of ships. A Deratisation Certificate or a Deratisation Exemption Certificate shall be issued ouly by the sanitary authorities of ports specified above. Every such certificate shall be valid for six months, but this period may be extended by one month in the case of a ship proceeding to its home port. If no valid certificate is produced, the sanitary authority at the ports mentioned in the second paragraph of this Article’ may after inquiry and inspection— (а) Themselves carry out deratisation of the vessel, or cause such operations to be carried out under their direction and control. On the completion of these operations to their satisfaction they shall issue a dated Deratisation Certificate. They shall decide in each case the technique which should be employed to secure- the practical extermination of rats on board, but details of the deratising process applied and of the number of rats destroyed shall be entered on the certificate. Destruction of rats shall be carried out so as to avoid as far as possible damage to the ship and cargo (if any). The operation must not last longer than twenty-four hours. In the case of ships in ballast the process- shall be carried out before taking cargo. Any charges made in respect of these operations of deratisation, and any question of compensation for damage, shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Article 18. (б) Issue a dated Deratisation Exemption Certificate if they are satisfied that the ship is maintained in such a condition that the rat population is reduced to a minimum. The reasons justifying the issue of such a certificate shall be set out in the certificate. Deratisation and deratisation exemption certificates shall be drawn up as far as possible in a uniform manner. Model certificates shall be prepared by the Office International d’Hygiene Publique. The competent authority of each country undertakes each year to furnish to the Office International de’Hygiene Publique a statement of the measures taken under this Article, and of the number of ships which have been subjected to deratisation,. or which have been granted deratisation exemption certificates^ at the ports referred to in the second paragraph of this Article. The Office International d’Hygiene Publique is requested to take, in accordance with the provisions of Article 14, all steps to secure the interchange of information regarding action taken under this Article and the results obtained. The provisions of this Article do not affect the rights- accorded to sanitary authorities by Articles 24-217 of this Convention. Governments shall do all in their power to ensure that all requisite and practicable measures are taken by the competent authorities to secure the destruction of rats in ports and their surroundings as well as on lighters and coastal vessels. (B)— Cholera. Article 29 .— Infected Ship. —A ship shall be regarded as infected if there is a case of cholera on board, or if there has been a case of cholera during the five days previous to the arrival of the ship in port. Suspected Ship. —A ship shall be regarded as suspected if there has been a case of cholera at the time of departure or during the voyage, but no fresh case in the five days previous to arrival. The ship shall continue to be regarded as suspected until it has been subjected to the measures prescribed by this Convention. Healthy Ship. —A ship shall be considered healthy if, although arriving from an infected port or having on board persons proceeding from an infected local area, there has been no case of cholera either at the time of departure, during the voyage, or on arrival. « / Cases presenting the clinical symptoms of cholera, in which no cholera vibrios have been found or in which vibrios not strictly conforming to the character of cholera vibrios have been found, shall be subject to all measures required in the case of cholera. Germ carriers discovered on the arrival of a ship shall be submitted after disembarkation to all the obligations which may be imposed in such a case by the laws of the country of arrival on its own nationals. •*•••• ■ »— - * . -y- 1 i •”7 -Article 30. — ^Cholera Infected Ships. —In the case of cholera, infected ships shall undergo the following measures: — (1) Medical inspection; (2) The sick shall be immediately disembarked and isolated; (3) The crew and passengers may be disembarked and either be kept under observation or subjected to surveillance during a period not exceeding five days reckoned from the date of arrival of the ship ; However, persons wbo can show that they have been pro tected against cholera by vaccination effected within the period of the previous six months, excluding the last six days thereof, may be subjected to surveillance, but not to observation ; (4) Bedding which has been used, soiled linen, wearing apparel and other articles, including foodstuffs, which, in the opinion of the sanitary authority of the port, have been recently contami nated, shall be disinfected; I {5) The parts of the ship that have been occupied by person infected with cholera or that the sanitary authority regard as infected, shall be disinfected; (6) Unloading shall be carried out under the supervision of the sanitary authority, which shall take all measures necessary to prevent the infection of the staff engaged in unloading.

Article 31. — Cholera Suspected Ships. —In the case of _ cholera, suspected ships shall undergo the measures prescribed in (1), (4), (5), (7), (8) and (9) of Article 30. The crew and passengers may be subjected to surveillance during a period which shall not exceed five days reckoned from the date of arrival of the ship. It is recommended that the crew be prevented during the same period from leaving the ship except on duty notified to the sanitary authority. Article 32.—Clinical Cholera .—If the ship has been declared infected or suspected on account only of a case on board presenting the clinical features of cholera, and two bacteriological examina tions, made with an interval of not less than 24 hours between them, have not revealed the presence of cholera or other suspi cious vibrios, the ship shall be considered healthy. Article 33. — Healthy Ships. —In the case of cholera, healthy ships shall be given free pratique immediately. The sanitary authority of the port of arrival may prescribe as regards these ships the measures specified in (1), (7), (8) and (9) of Article 30. The crew and passengers may be subjected to surveillance during a period which shall not exceed five days reckoned from the date of arrival of the ship. The crew may be prevented during the same period from leaving the ship except on duty notified to the sanitary authority. Article 34 .—Since anti-cholera vaccination is a method of proved efficacy in staying cholera epidemics, and consequently in lessening the likelyhood of the spread of the disease, sanitary administrations are recommended to employ, in the largest measure possible and as often as practicable, specific vaccination in cholera foyers and to grant certain advantages as regards restrictive measures to persons who have elected to be vaccinated. (C)— Yellow Fever. Article 35.—Infected Ship. —A ship shall be regarded as infected if there is a case of yellow fever on board, or if there was one at the time of departure or during the voyage.Suspected Ship. —A ship shall he regarded as suspected if, having had no case of yellow fever, it arrives after a voyage of less than six days from an infected port or from a port in close relation with an endemic centre of yellow fever, or it arrives after a voyage of more than six days and there is reason to believe that it may transport adult stegomyia (cedes egypti) emanating from the said port. Healthy Ship. —A ship shall be regarded as healthy, not withstanding its having come from an infected port, if on arriving after a voyage of more than six days it has had no case of yellow fever on board and either there is no reason to believe that it transports adult stegomyia or it is proved to the satis faction of the authority of the port of arrival— (a) That the ship, during its stay in the port of departure, was moored at a distance of at least 200 metres from the inhabited shore and at such a distance from harbour vessels (pontons) as to make the access of stegomyia improbable; (h) Or that the ship, at the time of departure, was effectively fumigated • in order to destroy mosquitoes. Article 36:-—Yellow Fever Infected Ships. —Ships infected with yellow fever shall undergo the following measures : — (1) Medical inspection ; \ (2) The sick shall be disembarked, and those of them whose illness has not lasted more than five days shall be isolated in such a manner as to prevent infection of mosquitoes; (3) The other persons who disembark shall be kept under observation or surveillance during a period which shall not exceed six days reckoned from the time of disembarkation: (4) The ship shall be moored at least 200 metres from the inhabited shore and at such a distance from the harbour boats (pontons) as will render the access of stegomyia improbable; (5) The destruction of mosquitoes in all phases of growth shall be carried out on board, as far as possible before discharge of cargo. If discharge is carried out before the destruction of mosquitoes, the personnel employed shall be subjected to observation or to surveillance for a period not exceeding six days from the time when they ceased unloading. Article 37. — Yellow Fever Suspected Ships. —Ships suspected of yellow fever may be subjected to the measures specified in (1), (3), (4) and (5) of Article 36. Nevertheless, if the voyage has lasted less than six days and if the ship fulfils the conditions specified in paragraphs (a) or (b) of Article 35 relating to healthy ships, the ship shall be subjected only to the measures prescribed by Article 36 (1) and (3) and to fumigation. * When thirty days have been completed after the departure of the ship from the infected port, and no case has occurred daring the voyage, the ship may be granted free pratique subject to preliminary fumigation should the sanitary authority consider this to be necessary. Article 38.—-Healthy Ships. —Healthy ships shall be granted free pratique after medical inspection. Article The measures prescribed in Articles 36 and 37 concern only those regions in which stegomyia exist, and they shall be applied with due regard.to the climatic conditions prevailing in such regions and to the stegomyia index. In other regions they shall be applied to the extent con sidered necessary by the sanitary authority. Article 40. —The masters of ships which have touched at ports infected with yellow fever are specially advised to cause a search to be made for mosquitoes and their larvae during the voyage and to secure their systematic destruction in all accessible parts of the ship, particularly in the store rooms, galleys, boiler rooms, water tanks and other places specially likely to harbour stegomyia.

(4) Bedding which has been used, soiled linen, wearing apparel and other articles which the sanitary authority consider to have been recently infected shall be disinfected. (5) Only the parts of the ship which have been occupied by persons ill with smallpox and which the sanitary authority regard as infected shall be disinfected.

It rests with each Government to take, after disembarkation, the measures which they consider appropriate to ensure the surveillance of persons who are not protected by vaccination, and who arrive on a ship which has had no case of smallpox on board, but who have left a local area, where smallpox is epidemic, within the previous fourteen days. Article 43.—AA is recommended that when ships call in countries where smallpox is epidemic, all precautions possible should be taken to secure the vaccination or revaccination of the crew. It is also recommended that Governments should make vaccination and revaccination as general as possible, especially in ports and in areas near frontiers. (F )—Regulations common to the above Diseases. Article 44. —The captain and the ship’s doctor shall answer all questions that are put to them by the sanitary authority with regard to the health of the ship during the voyage. When the captain and the doctor declare that there has not been any case of plague, cholera, yellow fever, typhus or small pox, or an unusual mortality among rats on the ship since the time of its departure, the sanitary authority may require them to make a formal declaration or a declaration under oath. Article 45. —In applying the measures specified in the preceding sub-sections (A), (B),_ (C), _(D) and (E), the sanitary authority shall take into consideration the fact of a ship carrying a doctor and the actual preventive measures taken in the course of the voyage, especially for the destruction of rats. The sanitary authorities of countries that find it convenient to come to an agreement on the matter may dispense with medical inspection and other measures in cases of healthy ships carrying a doctor specially commissioned by their country. Article 46.—Lt is recommended that Governments take account in determining the procedure to be applied to arrivals from another country of the steps taken in the latter country to combat infectious diseases and to prevent their transmission to other countries.Skips arriving from ports which satisfy the conditions set out in Articles 14 and 51 are not entitled solely on account of this fact to any special advantages at the port of arrival, but Governments undertake to take into the fullest consideration the measures already taken in these ports, so that the measure? to be taken at the port of arrival with regard to such ships shall be reduced to a minimum. With this object and in order to inconvenience shipping, commerce and traffic as little as possible, it is recommended that special agreements, in accordance with Article 5T of this Convention, be concluded in all cases where they may appear to be advantageous. Article 47 .—Ships arriving from an infected area which have been subjected to sufficient sanitary measures, to the satisfaction of the sanitary authority, shall not be subjected to these measures again on their arrival at a new port, whether belonging to the same country or not, unless since their departure some incident has occurred which requires the application of the sanitary measures set out above, and unless they have called at an infected port, otherwise than for taking in fuel. A ship shall not be considered as having “called at a port” if, without having been in communication with the shore, it has landed only passengers and their luggage, and mails, or if it has taken on board only mails or passengers with or without their luggage, who have not been in communication with the port or with an infected local area. In the case of yellow fever the ship shall, in addition, have kept as far as possible and at least two hundred metres from inhabited land, and at such a distance from the harbour boats (pontons) as to make access of stegomyia improbable. ..Article 48 .—The port authority applying sanitary measures shall, when requested, furnish the captain, or any other interested person, with a free certificate specifying the nature of the measures and the methods employed, the parts of the ship treated, and the reasons wffiy the measures have been applied. Similarly, they shall issue on demand to passengers who have arrived by an infected ship a free certificate setting out the date of their arrival, and the measures to which they and their luggage have been subjected. Section V.— General Provisions. Article 49 .—It is recommended— (1) That bills of health be issued free in all ports. (2) That fees for consular visas be reduced by reciprocal agreement, so as not to represent more than the cost of the service in question. (3) That the bill of health be set out in at least one of the languages recognised in maritime commerce, in addition to the language of the country where it is issued. (4) That special agreements in the spirit of Article 5T of this Con- vention be made witb a view to arriving at tbe gradual abolition of consular visas and bills of health. - Article 50 .— It is desirable that the number of ports furnished with an organisation and equipment sufficient for the reception of a ship whatever its health conditions may be, should m eacJi country be in proportion to the importance of its trade and shipping Nevertheless, without prejudice to the right of Gov ernments to make agreements for the establishment of common sanitary stations, each country shall provide at least one port on each of its sea-boards with the above-mentioned organisation and equipment. Moreover it is recommended that all large seaports should be so equipped that healthy ships, at any rate, may be subjected upon their arrival to the prescribed sanitary measures, and may not be sent to another port for this purpose. Every injected or suspected ship which arrives m a _ port not equipped for its reception shall be sent, at its own risk and peril tn one of the porffi which is open to ships of the category to which it belongs. Governments shall make known to the Office International d’Hygiene Publique which of their ports are open to arrivals from ports infected with plague, cholera, or yellow fever, and, in particular, those open to infected or suspected ships.nimr'.;' hi A.

Such a ship may, however, be permitted to land goods if the ship is isolated and if the goods are subjected to the measures laid down in Section II of Chapter II of this Convention. Such a ship may also be authorised to disembark passengers at their request, on condition that such passengers submit to the measures prescribed by the sanitary authority. The ship, if it is isolated, may also take on fuel, foodstuffs and water. Article 55 .—Each Government undertake to have a single sanitary tariff only, which shall be published, and the charges of which shall be moderate. This tariff shall be applied in ports to all ships, without distinction being made between national and foreign flags, and to foreigners in the same conditions as to the country’s own nationals.

Nevertheless, the provisions of Article 28 of this Convention shall be made applicable to them in all cases. Article 57. —Governments, taking into account their particular situation, may conplude special agreements amongst themselves, in order to make the sanitary measures prescribed by the Convention more efficacious and less burdensome. The texts of such agreements shall be communicated to the Office International d’Hygiene Publique. Section YI.— Measures at Land Frontiers. — (Travellers. — Railways.— Frontier Zones. — River-ways. Article 58. —Observation shall not be enforced at land frontiers. Only persons showing symptoms of the diseases mentioned in this Convention may be retained at frontiers. This principle does not deprive a country of its right to close a portion of its frontiers in case of need. In such a case the places to which frontier traffic shall be confined shall be desig nated, and properly equipped sanitary stations shall be set up at such places. These measures shall be notified immediately to the interested neighbouring country. * The expression “Territorial waters” shall be understood in its strictly juridical sense, it does not include the canals of Suez.

These measures may include the establishment at frontiers of sanitary stations, sufficiently equipped to ensure the surveil lance and 'the observation, if necessary, of the persons concerned, as well as for their medical examination, disinfection, dism- sectisation and vaccination. Wherever possible, these exceptional measures shall be made the subject of, special arrangements between adjoining States. Article Railway carriages for passengers, mails or luggage and goods trucks may not be detained at the frontier. However, if a carriage has been infected or has been occupied by a person suffering from plague, cholera, typhus or smallpox, it shall be detained for the time necessary to subject it to the prophylactic measures required in such a case.

The undersigned Plenipotentiaries have assembled on this date for the* purpose of signing- the International Sanitary Convention. The Plenipotentiaries of the German Empire, referring to Article 25 r make express reservations regarding the power given by the Convention to* the various Governments, allowing them to impose observation in the casfr of bubonic plague. The Plenipotentiaries of Brazil declare that they are authorised to sign the Convention ad referendum under the reservations inserted in the proces- verbal of the last plenary sitting. The Plenipotentiaries of Chili declare that they wish to make similar reservations to those formulated by the Plenipotentiaries of Brazil and of Portugal. The Plenipotentiaries of China, in the name of their Government, make express reservations as to the undertaking, referred to in the second paragraph of Article 8, to make obligatory the notification of diseases mentioned in the Convention. In the name of their Government, the Plenipotentiaries of Egypt renew the express reservations which they have formulated regarding the presence at the Conference of a Delegate representing the Soudan. They declare,, moreover, that the. presence of this Delegate cannot affect the sovereign rights of Egypt. The Plenipotentiaries of Spain declare that they make in the name 1 of their Government a similar reservation to that of the Plenipotentiaries; of the United States of America relative to Article 12. The Plenipotentiaries of the United States of America make a formal declaration that the signature by them of the International Sanitary Con vention of this date cannot be interpreted in the sense that the United States recognise a regime or a body functioning as the Government of a signatory or acceding Power when the United States have not recognised such regime or body as the Government of that Power. They further declare that the- participation of the United States of America in the International Sanitary Convention of this date does not entail any contractual obligation on the part of the United States towards amy signatory or acceding Power represented by any regime or body that the United States do not recognise as corresponding to the Government of such a Power until it is represented by a Government recognised by the United States. ^ The Plenipotentiaries of the United States of America declare, on the other hand, that their Government reserve the right to decide whether, from the point of view of measures to be applied, a foreign local area should be considered as infected and to determine the measures which should be applied in special circumstances to arrivals in its own ports. The considerable work accomplished by the International Sanitary Con ference and the numerous new provisions that it contains, not having been able to be telegraphed to Her Majesty the Queen of the Kings and to His Koval and Imperial Highness, Prince Tafari Makonnen, Heir and Kegent of the Empire, the Delegate of the Empire of Abyssinia declares that he must ajbstain from signing the Convention until he receives the necessary instructions. The British Plenipotentiaries declare that their signature does not bind any part of the British Empire which is an independent member of the League of Nations and which does not separately sign, or accede to, the- Convention. They declare, in addition, that they reserve the right not to apply the- provisions of the second paragraph of Article 8 for all the Protectorates, Colonies Possessions or Countries under British mandate which maj be parties to the Convention and which, for reasons of a practical nature cannot give full effect to the provisions relative to the obligatory notification ot the diseases mentioned in the said Article. The Delegate of Canada reserves for his Government the right to decide whether, from the point of view of measures to be applied, a foreign local area should be considered as infected and to determine the measures whicn should be applied in special circumstances to arrivals in Canadian ports. Subject to this reservation the Delegate of Canada declares that his Govern ment are ready to take into consideration the obligations of Article 12 oi the Convention and the official information which they may receive on the subject of the existence of diseases m foreign countiies. The Delegate of India declares that he is authorised to sign the Inter national Sanitary Convention with the reservation that India, for reasons of a practical nature, is not at present in a position to accept &lt; the obligation arising out of Article 8 as far as the obligatory notification of diseases mentioned in that Article is concerned, except in large towns or m the case of an epidemic.32 The British Flenipoten1^^^;^clgE^|^Gfd place on record that the Teservation of the Plenipotentiaries of Persia on Article 90 cannot in any way modify the' existing status quo-; pending the conclusion of * an agreement between the Persian and British 1 Governmi&amp;n^; v &gt; ■ • r- The Plenipotentiaries 'of the Eepnblib of Finland ' dfeblaie : th'lt as protec tion against cholera is not a sufficient guarantee, their'GoVeriimeht) notwith standing the provisions of Article 30, reserve the right to subject persbiis thus protected to observation, if necessary. On the other hand, as traffic across the Finnish frontier can make use only of two railways to the East, very close to one another, and a single railway to the West, thus preventing the partial closing of the frontier, Finland, in order to avoid total closing in the case of an epidemic, reserves the right to establish observation, if necessary, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 58. The Plenipotentiaries of Japan declare that their Government reserve The right— 1. To transmit the notifications and information which the Convention requires to be sent to the Office International d’Hygiene pnblique, through the intermediary of the Far Eastern Bureau at Singapore;, 2. To take , such measures conceming cholera germ, carriers as the sanitary authorities consider necessary. The Plenipotentiaries of Lithuania declare that in acceding to the Con vention they make express reservations as to its being put into effect between Lithuania and Poland, so long as the normal relations between the twq -countries are not re-established. These reservations are of particular importance in so far as concerns the provisions of Article 9, 16, 57 and 66. * The Plenipotentiaries of the Netherlands declare in the name of their. Government that the latter reserve the right, in so far as the Dutch East Indies are concerned, to apply the measures prescribed in the second para graph of Article 10 in a similar manner to arrivals from local areas infected with rat plague. They declare, in addition, that their Government reserve the right, in so far as the Dutch East Indies are concerned, to interpret Article 27 (2) in the sense that the destruction of rats prescribed in that Article may be applied to ships carrying a cargo from an area infected with rat plague, if the sanitary authority consider that such cargo is likely to harbour rats, and that it is loaded in such a manner as to prevent the investigations, referred to in the last paragraph of Article 24. The Plenipotentiaries of Persia declare that nothing justifies the main tenance in the Convention of a special provision regarding the Persian Gulf. The fact that the Convention contains Article 90, constituting Section Y of part II, prevents them from signing without making the most express reservations. The Plenipotentiaries of Persia declare, in addition, that the status quo cannot in any way bind their Government. On the other hand, they reserve on behalf of their Government the right not to apply the provisions of Article 8 relative to. the obligatory, notification of the diseases mentioned in that Article. The Plenipotentiary of Portugal declares that he is authorised by his Government to sign the Convention ad referendum under the reservations inserted in the proces-verbal of the last plenary sitting. The Plenipotentiary of Turkey declares that Turkey has not renounced by any Treaty its right to be represented on the Sanitary, Maritime and Quarantine Board of Egypt. On the other hand, having regard to the stipulations of the Straits Convention signed at Lausanne, and to the special conditions affecting the Straits of the Bosphorus and of the Dardanelles, he reserves the right of the Sanitary Administration of Turkey to place a sanitary, guard on board any merchant ship passing through the Straits without a doctor and arriving from an infected port, in order to ensure that the ship does not call at a Turkish port. It remains understood, however, that the delay and expense necessitated by such a guard will be reduced to a minimnm. The Plenipotentiaries of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics recalling the declaration which they made on the 26th May at the sitting of the First Commission, on the subject of Article 7 of the proposed text of the Convention, declare that they have no objections to make on the subject of the provision relative to the right of the Office Internationad d’Hygiene piiblique to conclude arrangements with other sanitary organisations; but they are of the opinion that this right results from the Agreement of Rome of 1907^ which determined the functions of the Office. They consider, therefore, that the provision referred to above, which is merely a confirmation of&lt;'this right, should have appeared in the vroces-verhal only, and should not have been made an Article of the Convention itself.' ~ ■ - ‘ ■ ■ 33 The Plenipotentiaries of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics recall that on the occasion of the discussion of Article 12 of the Convention they, voted ag'ainst the provision giving Governments the right _ to prolong in, exceptional cases the application of sanitary measures, notwithstanding the, declaration of the interested State that the danger from the disease no longer exists. They consider that this provision may affect one of the fundamental principles of earlier Conventions and become the cause of misunderstandings which may arise from its application. They declare, therefore, that, having regard to 'the spirit of the Convention, this provision can be considered only in exceptional cases, when the Government of the infected local area do not fulfil the obligations prescribed by the Convention in the matter. The Plenipotentiaries of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics recall the reservations which they have already made in the Second Commission on the subject of the functions and duties of the Sanitary, Maritime and Quarantine Board of Egypt. They desire to emphasise that Articles^ 70 and 165, in particular, give the right to the Board to establish various sanitary, maritime and quarantine police regulations on condition that such, regulations to become executory shall be accepted by the various _ Powers represented on the Board. As the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have not yet anv representative on the Sanitary, Maritime and Quarantine Board of Egypt, the Delegation of the Union reserve for their Government the right to accept, or not to accept, the measures instituted by that board. The undersigned take note of the reservations set out above and declare that their respective countries reserve the right to benefit by them in the. case of arrivals from the countries in the name of which they have been, formulated. In faith of which, the Plenipotentiaries have signed the present Protocol. Done at Paris, the Twenty-first day of June, One Thousand Nine Hundred and Twenty six.
