The inscription identifies an individual, Sa-nebet-Junet and makes a statement of the individual's social status. The top is incised with a very detailed, deeply incised design with regular line flow. The workmanship is slightly rough and the piece is not very carefully made. \r\n\r\nThe scarab functioned as a private name seal and as a user-individualized amulet. It wsa originally mounted or threaded. Teh amulet should assure constancy of individual existence and social status, as well as renewal. \r\n\r\nThe combination of frame lines with 'C'-shaped elements is less common than 'S' and 'Z'-shaped spiral scroll enclosures.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1911 (?)", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/22996", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1911 (?)
