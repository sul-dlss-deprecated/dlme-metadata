Enclosure No. 1. India Office to Foreign Office. India Office, Sir, 20th December 1905. With reference to the letter from the Foreign Office of the 17th April last and previous correspondence as to the compensation to be awarded to Lieutenant-Colonel Dougins and Lieutenant (now Captain) Lorimer, on account of the injuries sustained by them while travelling on duty in Luristan, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Morley to transmit, to be laid before Sir E. Grey, copy of a Despatch* which, on receipt of the above- cited letter from your Department, was addressed to the Government * Despatch to India, No. 46 (Political), dated 19th May 1905. Letter from India, No. 298, dated 31st August 191)5. of India, and of their reply. 2. It will be seen that, as regards the claims of Colonel Douglas and Captain Lorimer to pension or gratuity in respect of their wounds, to which reference was made in Sir H. Walpole’s letter of the 16th March last, the Government of India consider that both officers are entitled to compensation under Article, 730 and 732 and extract from Artic|e 732 of the Civil Service Regulations, and have accordingly recommended the grant to them of such pension and gratuity as may lie admissible, under Articles 1504-5 of the Indian Army Regulations, on the report of a Medical Board. Colonel Douglas ana Captain Lorimer have accordingly been examined by the Medical Board at this Office, and copies of the reports on the two eases are enclosed. 3. As regards the question of the responsibility of Colonel Douglas and Captain Lorimer raised in the letter from the Treasury of the 31st January last, it is no doubt true that the disturbed state of the Lur country was within the knowledge of these officers at the time and that they were aware that the survey necessarily involved some danger. But Mr. Morley is of opinion that the fact of Captain Larimer's having safely traversed the country on his way to Khoremabad warranted their proceeding on the journey, and he does not consider that they would have been justified in immediately turning hack on account of the attempt made to extort a further sum of money after they had started ; nor that there was anything in their dealings with the Direkwand Chiefs which in any way contributed to bring about the attack. 4. Mr. Morley would, therefore, recommend, for Sir E. Grey’s favourable consideration,- the following grants as appropriate in the circumstances :— To Colonel Douglas a temporary pension of 200/. a year. To Captain Lorimer a gratuity of 400/.,f being 12 months’ pay in . _ , „ „ ^ , the grade of his appointment as i brade mv, Ks. 500 a month. TT - ° . » -r-r- 1 1 ^ His Britannic Majesty s Vice- Consul for Arabistan. I am to explain that the practice of this Office in regard to wound pensions is to grant them in the first instance for one year. They are renewable each year on production of a medical certificate that thedisability continues to exist, and after five years the temporary pension may be made permanent. 5. With regard to the further question raised by Colonel Douglas in his letter of the 3rd April last as to the payment from public funds of the travelling expenses from Tehran to London of himself and his servant, as well as of the expenses incurred by him on account of an operation and medical attendance generally, Mr. Morley concurs in the view of the Government of India that such expenses should be advanced to Colonel Douglas, but he would leave it to Sir E. Grey to decide whether the amount advanced should be recovered from the pension which it may ultimately b'* decided to grant to Colonel Douglas. I am t) add that, under Indian regulations, there are precedents for the payment by Government of the expenses of a serious operation necessitated by injuries sustained by an officer in the performance of duty, even when the officer has received an injury pension or gratuity. 6. In Sir H. Walpole’s letter of the 16th March, agreeing to the proposal in your letter of the 25th February that one half of the cost of compensating Colonel Douglas and Captain Lorimer for their actual losses and expenses in Persia should be borne by the Indian Exchequer, in the event of its proving impossible to recover the amount from the Persian Government, it was assumed that the same principle would be recognised in regard to any pension or gratuity which might be granted to these officers under the Indian regulations. The Secretary of State in Council will be glad to receive the assent of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to that view. I have, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State, A. Godley.

With reference to your letter 28'll of 21st February 1905, and to previous correspondence, I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to transmit to you herewith, to be laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, copy of a letter from the India Office, with enclosure in original, relative to the compensation to be awarded to Lieutenant-Colonel Douglas and Captain Lorimer on account of the injuries sustained by them while travelling on the public service in Luristan.nk The Lords Commissioners will observe that it is proposed to grant (1) a temporary pension of 200/. a year to Lieutenant-Colonel Douglas, and (2) a gratuity of 400/. to Captain Lorimer, under Indian Regu lations. There is also the question of the payment of Lieutenant-Colonel Douglas’s travelling expenses from Tehran to London, and of the expenses of the severe and repeated operations and of the medical attendance which were rendered necessary by the serious nature of his wound. Sir E. Grey concurs in the view of the Secretary of State for India with regard to the proposed pension and gratuity, which should, together with all other expenditure incurred on this account, whether originally charged to India or to His Majesty’s Government, he divided equally between Indian and Imperial funds. But he considers that, in view of the fact that Lieutenant-Colonel Douglas, although practically deprived of the use of one arm, is at present in discharge of his duties at Tehran and in receipt of full pay, it would he reasonable that the pension should he held to cover his travelling expenses to London and the cost of the operations he had to undergo. I am to express Sir E. Grey’s hope that the Lords Commissioners Avill take these proposals into their favourable consideration, and that they will give their sanction to one half of the expenditure involved being charged to British funds. I am further to request that they will sanction the additional expenses enumerated on the enclosed list, one half of which will he eventually recoverable from the Government of India. It may be added, as foreshadowed in my letter of 9th January 1905, a claim for 2,000/. has been presented to the Persian Government on account of their responsibility for this incident, 1,000/. for the losses sustained by the two officers, which will cover the amount advanced to them by His Majesty’s Government, and 1,000/. as compensation to them for injuries received, and tnose sums, when recovered, will be divided between His Majesty’s Government and that of India. The Persian Government have so far refused to admit their liability in the matter, hut His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran is being instructed to press the claim.

Captain Lorimer should le awarded the maximum gratuity. It appears to them that the case would be met by the grant of a gratuity of 300/., and they accordingly sanction the charge to British funds of a sum not exceeding 150/. m respect of compensation to Captain Lorimer. . Their Lordships further approve the payment of the additional 1 expenditure, amounting to 618/. 12s. 3c/., specified in the list enclosed in the letter under reply.

Sir, Enclosure No. 4. India Office to Foreign Office. India Office, 9th April 1906, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to acknowled° , e the receipt of Sir E. Gorst’s letter of the 16th March relative tcT the c mipensation to be awarded to Lieutenant-Colonel Douglas and Captain Lorimer on account of injuries sustained by them m i^Secretary of State in Council observes that, while sanctioning the temporary pension of 200/. per annum proposed lor Lieutenant- Colonel Douglas, the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury do not understand the principle upon which it is proposed that, whereas Lieutenant-Colonel Douglas is not recommended for the maximum pension of his rank, Captain Lorimer should be awarded the maximumgratuity. They have therefore reduced the amount of which they are‘prepared to contribute a moiety, f rom 400/. to &lt;300/. I am, therefore, directed to explain that the cases ol Lieutenant- Colonel Douglas and of Captain Loriraer fall under distinct eategones. Lieutenant-Colonel Douglas’ injury was reported by the Medical Board to be “of a very serious nature ” and “ likely to be permanent in its present effects.” The injury was nor, however, reported to be equivalent to the total loss of a limb; he was, therefore, awarded a pension not on the highest scale permissible to his rank, but a pension which will, under Regulations, become permanent, if, at the en l of n\e years, his condition lias not improved. Captain Lorimer’s injury was reported to he “ severe and permanent in character.” Had it been reported to be as serious as that of Lieutenant-Colonel Done las he would have been recommended for a pension on the same terms as that officer, though on the lower scale to which his rank would have entitled him. In the circumstances, however, it was considered that the justice of his ease would hardly he met except by the grant of the full gratuity admissible under the Regulations, viz., 12 months’ pay (Rs. 6,000 per annum) or 400/. The Secretary of State in Council trusts that, in the light of this explanation, the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury may he moved to reconsider their objection to the gratuity proposed for Captain Lorimer in my letter of the 20th December last.

We have carefully examined Lieutenant-Colonel J. A. Douglas, Military Attache, Persia, and find that while travelling in Persia Colonel Douglas was shot and wounded by a bullet that fractured the right forearm. The bullet fractured the radius in two places and shattered the ulna at the junction between the lower and middle third. Portions of diseased and softened bone were afterwards removed, leaving a gap of about l. 1 , inches between the ends of the bone. Operations have been performed to unite the ends of the ulna, with only partial success, and he has partially lost the power of the right arm. This loss is permanent. Our opinion on the under-mentioned questions is as follows : — 1. Has the officer lost an eye or a limb or the use of a limb ; or is the injury equivalent to the loss of a limb, and is it permanent or likely to be permanent ?—No. 2. If the injury does not come under the category of 1 , is it of a very serious nature, and is it permanent in its present effects or likely to be permanent ?—Yes. o. If the injury does not come under the categories of 1 or 2, is it severe and permanent in character ? 4. If the injury does not come under the categories of ], 2, or 3, it should be classified here, making use of one of the following terms :— severe, but not permanent ; or slight and permanent or not permanent, as the case may be ? 5. Was it caused by military duty? If so, the particular act of military duty in which the officer was engaged should be stated ?—No. 6. Was it contracted in circumstances over which he had no control ?—Yes. 7. Eor what period, calculated from the date of the injury, is it probable that the officer will be incapacitated from military duty arising therefrom ?—He is fit to return to political duty in Persia.

We have carefully examined Captain D. L. R. Lorimer, and find that on 25th October 1904 he was attacked by Lur tribesmen, and sustained the following injuries :— 1. Gunshot wound, palm of left hand, fracturing the head of first metacarpal bone, and resulting in subluxation of the meta carpophalangeal joint with loss of power in flexion and of sensation in the left index finger. This injury is of a permanent character. 2. Fracture of malar process of right superior maxilla, with injury to infraorbital branch of fifth nerve, the result of probably a blow with a stone. 3. Fracture of four teeth. This has necessitated his having artificial teeth to restore power of mastication.4. General loss of health, with dyspepsia. Not permanent. Our opinion on the under-mentioned questions is as follows : 1. Has the officer lost an eye or a limb or the use of a limb ; or is the injury equivalent to the loss of a limb, and is it permanent or likely to be permanent ?—No. 2. If the injury does not come under the category of 1, is it of a very serious nature, and is it permanent in its present effects or likely to be permanent ?—No. 3. If the injury does not come under the categories ol 1, or 2, is it severe and permanent in character ?—Yes. 4.

Was it contracted in circumstances over which he had no control ?—Yes. 7. For what period, calculated from the date of the injury, is it probable that the officer will be incapacitated from military duty arising therefrom?—Is permanently seconded for civil work.

I HAVE received your note of the 6th instant respecting the attack made on Colonel Douglas and Captain Lorimer hy some Direkwand Lurs in the autumn of 1904. As you are aware, some of the above-mentioned Lurs have been arrested, You stated that five men in the photograph and of the names sent to you were actually ^ engaged in the attack, and you desired the rest to remain in gaol as a means of arresting the other offenders. They are at present in gaol, hut, in spite of careful inquiries made into the matter, no other offender has become known, but it is certain that the five men in question committed the offence. Under these circumstances no other step remains to be taken which may require instructions to be given. With regard to the compensation, you state that “ in view of the dilatory and inefficient measures taken by the Persian Government for the punishment of the culprits and the unsatisfactory nature of the results achieved His Majesty’s Government see no reason to modify their attitude.” On this point I have the honour to refer you to the letter written by Colonel Douglas and Captain Lorimer to the Begler Begi of Kurram Abad after their journey and the incident. These officers were distinctly prohibited on account of the disturbed state of the Lurs and the insecurity of the roads, but they wished to proceed and stipulated that no responsibility would rest with the Government authorities. Since the officers in question were prohibited from proceeding on their journey on account of the disturbed state of the roads and the tribes, and since they placed themselves in danger by proceeding on the journey with imaginary confidence, no responsibility whatever rests with the Persian Government which would necessitate the payment of compensation. In view of the measures taken for the arrest ot the culprits, how can it be expected that delay 7 should be attributed to the Persian Government and that the efficient steps taken and the results thereof, viz., the arrest and imprisonment of the offenders, should be considered unsatisfactory ? It is obvious that after a little consideration of the details and the measures taken by the Persian Government and after reference to my previous correspondence on the subject you will, with your well-known courtesy, inform your Government of the efficient measures taken by the Persian Government, and the responsibility incurred by Colonel Douglas and Captain Lorimer in travelling by the road in question and in paying no attention to the representations of the local authorities. Inclosure 3 in No. 1. Mr. E. Grant Duff to Salar-ed-Dowleh. Tehran, March 13, 1906. AS your Imperial Highness is doubtless aware, in the autumn of 1904 certain Direkwand Lurs treacherously 7 attacked Colonel Douglas, Military Attache of Hj s Majesty’s Legation, and Captain Lorimer, His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz, whiltj travelling between Khoramabad and Dizful. Both the officers mentioned were wounded, the former seriously. The Lurs guilty of this outrage formed the escort oii the British officers, and had sworn on the Koran to see them safely to Dizful. I ®| not know whether your Highness has been informed that your predecessor in the, Governorship of Luristan promised early last year to undertake an expedition ^1 punish the Direkwand Lurs for their act of treachery. At the Birman Birina 5 urgent request His Majesty’s Minister consented that the dispatch of the expedition should be delayed till after the harvest. In spite of the promise given by ® Highness, no efficient steps have, as far as I know, been taken to capture the offender^ whose names are well known to the Persian Government. Tour Imperial Highness’ sense of justice is well known, and I am confident tha you will not permit an'unprovoked attack on the officers of a friendly Power to ? unpunished. As there is still some time before the Direkwand tribe proceed to thei summer quarters, I venture to suggest that advantage should be taken of this fact capture the Mirs concerned in the outrage on our officers.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government. ] dealt with in your despatch No. 2 of the 3rd January, you should inform the Persian Government that, in our opinion, the dilatory and inefficient measures taken by them for the punishment of the culprits, together with the unsatisfactory nature of the results achieved, preclude any modification in the attitude of His Majesty’s Government. You should also urge them to take advantage of the present season to secure the punishment of the Lurs, and if you have not already done so, you should address the Salar-ed-Dowleh in similar terms. mt PERSIA.

CONFIDENTIAL. B ] [February 3.] Section 1. [4138] No. 1. 7l/r. E. Grant Duff to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received February 3.) (No. 2. Confidential.) t Tehran, January 3, 1906. ^ TUT reference to my despatch No. 258 of the 5th ultimo, I have the honour to transmit correspondence regarding the attack on Colonel J. A. Douglas and Captain Lorimer. I recently received a telegram from His Majesty’s Consul at Kermanshah stating that a mare belonging to Captain Lorimer and some mules which formed part of the caravan at the time of the outrage had been recovered. I instructed Captain Gough that these animals should be sold, and that on being informed of their sale, I would deduct the proceeds from the compensation claimed from the Persian Government. I so informed Mushir-ed-Dowleh, who replied in the inclosed note, inquiring on what grounds compensation was claimed by His Majesty’s Government. I answered by referring his Excellency to the note addressed by Sir A. Hardinge to the Persian Government on the 11th January, 1905, in which the amount of compensation claimed and the views of His Majesty’s Government are very clearly stated. As the Persian Government show no disposition to settle our claim, I have the honour to ask that I may be furnished with your instructions. It would, I venture to think, be impolitic not to press this case home. Luristan has been, and still is, in a condition bordering on open rebellion. This condition is entirely due to the utter folly and incapacity of a succession of Persian Governors. The Salar-ed-Dowleh has recently been appointed to succeed the Firman Firma in the Governorship of Luristan, and although His Imperial Highness is to the full as stupid, cruel, and incapable as most of the other members of the Kajar tribe, he is, I think, anxious to be on good terms with Ilis Majesty’s Legation. I know him well, and shall speak to him seriously about the state of the province before he leaves Tehran. If pressed, he will perhaps at first act with some vigour, and if you see fit to furnish me with a strong message to the Persian Government, it is possible that I may be able to effect the arrest and punishment of the remainder of the Mirs implicated in the attack on our officers. I hear from a certain source that persons about the Shah’s Court have been stating that Colonel Douglas and Captain Lorimer were attacked and wounded by their own servants, because they refused to pay their wages. As the author of this statement is the Shah’s principal physician, Dr. Schneider, I think it all the more necessary to make it clear to the Persian Government that His Majesty’s Govern ment have no idea of dropping the case and of foregoing the payment of com pensation. ° w It is, Colonel Douglas thinks, probable that an expedition against the Direkwends during the winter, when they are in the low hills north of Dizful, would be attended vith success, and would speedily bring the tribe to terms.

Mir Taimur, brother of Mir Sarbeng, is amongst the prisoners. ik e ratter was present on the occasion of the attack, hut his brother has been arrested. Mir Tafhad called by the Legation Mir Afra, died in the prison here, and his body was shown to Dr. Williams, of the British Consulate, and a few other doctors. In any case five of the culprits have been with the prisoners, and the remaining seven men are most important for the punishment of the rest of the offenders. I think I have done good service, but I have resigned the Government of the province in question. No doubt the Persian Government will take suitable measuies m the matter through the new Governor, and will send a reply to the representations o the British Legation. I have already explained to the Grand Vizier and repeat to you ray reasons for resigning the Governorships of Burujird and Lunstan. It is on account of my health and my family which prevent me from travelling. I hope my resigns- lion will be accepted. Inclosure 2 in No. 1. Mr. E. Grant Duff to Mushir-ed-Dowleh. December 26, 1905.

Lord Lansdowne has carefully considered the matter, in communication with Sir A. Ilardinge, who, as ? r r. Brod- rick is aware, is also in England. Sir A. Eardinge considers that it would be a mistake to execute the one culprit who has been identified, as such a measure would tend to deter the others from surrendering. He suggests that the Firman Firma should be urged to endeavour to se cure more of the guilty persons by negotiation, making use of the captive as a hostage, or, if that fails, by a re sumption of operations which Eis Highness promised to un dertake as soon as the harvest was over. Sir A. Eardinge is of opinion that the question of compensation can lie in abeyance for the present. The completion of a further loan to the Persian Government, if it took place, might render it easier to extract pay ment from them. The amount due can always, in the last u resort, be deducted from Telegraph Royalties. j LordLord L&amp;nsdowne is disposed to concur in the views ex- ^ C pressed hy Sir A. Kardinge, and His Lordship proposes, if :'r. Brodrick agrees, to instruct Mr. Grant Luff in the sense suggested.

I have at the same time, the honour to transmit a photograph of these prisoners which has teen sent me by Prince Nosret-ed-Dcv/leh, a son of the Firman Firms.'s, who is acting as his lather's Aide de Camp and Private Secretary, and which may enable Colonel Douglas to identify those of the men captured who were actually concerned in the outrage. In view of the success which has attended the Firman Firma's efforts to secure the persons of these offenders, I have abstained from pressing Dae Marquess of Lansdowne, K.G., &amp;c., «c., &amp;c. the G2000.—3/1905.the Persian Government to resume active operations against the Lurs until I hear more from Captain Gough of His Highness* actual plans. It is possible that the possession of these hostages may enable him to negotiate with the tribe for the surrender of the remaining guilty Mirs, especially if he is able to promise that in that case the capital penalty will not be inflicted upon them. I have as yet no inform ation as to the methods by which he captured them, but I have very little doubt that he employed treachery for the purpose, and that the remaining Dlrekvend Mlrs are likely on that account to hesitate before placing themselves in his power, but it is possible that an assurance by His Majesty's Legation that if they submit and come in, their lives will be spared, may carry with them a weight which would not attach to any merely Persian promises. I await Your Lordship's instructions to me, or, should I have availed myself of your permission to take leave before they can reach me, to Mr. Grant Duff, as to the punishment which should be inflicted uponupon these prisoners, before making any communication on the subject to the Persian Government. As regards the payment of compensation for the outrage, which, as Your Lordship is aware, I have claimed, but which the Persian Government has en deavoured to escape on the ground that the British officers were responsible, in so far as they dis regarded the warnings of the local authorities, there is, I fear, little likelihood of my obtaining a satis factory reply so long as the Shah and Grand Vizier to whom every question of Importance is referred by the Prince Kegent and the Mushlr-ed-Dowleh, are ab sent from Persia.

I am unable myself to identify any of the remainder, hut my servant, who was with me at the time, says that he recognises three of the others, viz: IIos. 3 . k - j:no counting from the right of the photograph (left cl tne line) - I think he is right, and that the young man on mir Laji's left hand is his son Mir ITazar Ali Khan. ns regards the punishment to be inflicted I am strong ly 01 0 pi n i°n that it should be such that it will act deterrent to any of the neighbouring tribes who might be inclined to commit similar outrages, and I think that no thing less than the execution of the men actually impli cated will have this effect. The Persian authorities as a willI® will doubtless also exact a fine from the tribe as a whole and the remaining prisoners might be held as hostages un til it is paid. Captain Lorimer, who was with me, saw far more of these men than I n^self did, he having travelled up with them from Lizful to Khurramabad before he met me. He is at present on leave in England and could doubtless identi fy some of the men. His address is c /o H. S. King and Company, 9 Fall Mall. (Signed) J. A. Douglas. Lieutenant-Colonel.

I have the honour to acknowledge receipt ol a photograph of the Dirakwand Mirs arrested hy the Faman Farna and of a series of documents referring to Luristan affairs, forwarded to me under your orders I regret that there has been unavoidable delay in ac- m knowledging them. I forward enclosed a separate note on the identi fication of the prisoners in the photograph, and I return the photo. I am not clear whether I am intended to comment or the otner papers, some of which are now very old. As however silence might be thought to imply entire agree ment, I shall note the points on which I find myself at variance whether as regards facts or opinions. 2. Turning to the basis of the file, Captain Williams* despatch dated 26. 3. 05. the first matter of Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.of interest is the account of the secret history of the outrage as given by the Farnan Farna. I think that Captain Williams had probably the best of reasons for believing in the sincerity of the Farnan Farna, for it is quite likely that the latter himself believed in the truth of his statement. That however goes a very short distance towards proving its truth. Personally I am as much convinced as one can be of anything that does not take place before one's eyes in Luristan, that the Fath-i-Sultan had nothing to do with the planning of the outrage. The facts adduced in support of his complicity can be accepted without raising any real presumption in that direction. I should ulso feel disposed to acquit the Muzaffer-ul-Mulk, though in this case I do not know the accused personally. The Farnan F. evidently will not accept his trials as fortuitous or sent by providence and is seeking for a human explanation. # In Mehr'Ali Khan (sagwand) however I have no confidenceconfidence, and If it could be proved that he and the Beglar Begi had subsequently profited by our robbery, I would incline to view them as probable co-instiga tors of it. It is true that Mehr Ali Khan and Fazil Khan (x Khanjan Khan) are bitter enemies and that at the same time they have separate dealings with the Dirakwand; but I do not think that there are two parties among the Dirakwand in the sense that one could take action without the consent of the other. An undertaking with only half the Dirakwand would be worthless for practical purposes though such partial understandings might temporarily exist. To proceed however to matters of fact. The agreement for my journey was not made as represented. One Baranl, Kat Khuda of the Beharwand (an inde pendent sub section) bound himself by oath to Khan^an, and the representative Mirs of the Dirakwand, who were all present, bound themselves in a similar way to him for my safety. The Mirs referred to included Mir Haji and his relations, as also all the other principalprincipal chiefs, e.g. Mir Tatar (with Mir Baba Khan and others of his party) and the sons of the once powerful and the lately deceased Namdar Khan. To the best of my knowledge Mir Rustam (locally Rusam) is the son of Mir Khan Namdar and the brother of Mir Kazim Khan. This fact I confirmed again as far as possible, after my return to Ahwaz. This and the fact that Mir Rustem was doubtful of his own footing so soon after his father's death and did not take a very influential part in the various negotiations, seem to knock the bottom out of the Farnan Kama's theory. Mir Namdar died in July. The message ascribed to Mehr All Khan is not In the least consonant with the existing facts. Both parties were present not only on my upward journey, but again at Shall-in-Shall. The story of Mir Tatar etc. joining us later with a strong contingent is an absolute myth. They had all come up with me and remained at Shah-in-Shah amusing themselves with raiding in the surrounding country, till Colonel Douglas and I join-( 4 ) joined them there about a week later. All that depends on this assertion goes there fore by the board. Eventually there were considerable differences among the Mirs, hut only, I am convinced as to the method to be pursued in despoiling us. So Tar as appearances went, previous to the final catastrophe Mir Tatar and Mir Nazar All Khan were the the moderates, though Mir Tatar was the first to broach the question of blackmail, and the chief spokes man until shortly before the end. In Captain Williams §3. (1) The Mir referred to was Mir Tatar. (2) I never to my recollection made any such statement. There had been some accretion the previous day to a convoy of plundered cattle which the Mirs were es corting along with us, but I do not think this brought any recruits to our despoilers (3) nv. 0 uable. 1Possible; but I am not by any means cer tain that the affair was a foregone conclu sion when we joined the Mirs at Shah-in- Shah . I should not set any weight on this argument. I cannot agree with either of the points mentioned. If my facts are correct especially as re gards the relationship of Mir Rustam, the scheme of differential treatment for the two (somewhat suppositious) parties is largely deprived of its rationale. As far as my observations carried me there were three main parties or factions - Mir Haji's, Mir Tatar's and the sons of Mir Namdar (Mir Rustam and Mir Kazim Khan). Where however freedom of speech and dissen- tience of opinion are so conspicuous, it would require minute knowledge and long experience to render possible any estim ate of exactly how far, and when,the exist- • enceexistence of such parties would become a factor in the determining on a proposed course of ac tion. There are no primary reasons for absolving Mir Nazar Ali Khan. With Mir Barkhurdar Khan I am acquainted but he was not with us; I know nothing of 'Mir Mehr Ali Khan.' I should not lay much stress on a money fine. In such cases it is a poor policy to take from those that have not even that they have. It would probably fall heaviest on innocent people, and it would have no moral effect: A fine of rifles, which abound,whether put on the tribe, or on the families concerned could only be considered desirable from every point of view. When however the Persian Gov ernment are in a position to exact rifles from a Lur tribe they will have solved the problem of governing Luristan. I cannot consider it likely that serious internalinternal disruption could be produced among . the Dirakwand. Mir HaJi,however willing, with an unpopular cause would not venture even to raise his voice, and it is impro bable that he would receive any armed as sistance from Fazil Knan in Dirakwand terri tory. I would subscribe to the first alterna tive. I do not think that there is much to be gained either in security or permanence by putting the arrangements for opening the Luristan route in the hands of Persian Offi cials. It may however be difficult to re fuse their overtures, especially now that tne whole question has been dragged so much into the light. The Farnan Farna has for months been declaring that he is on the point of throwing open a caravan route between Khuramabad and Dizful, but up to the beginning of Septem-September, the date of my latest advices from Diz- f'-J-, tnere were no indications of facts being about to take the place of words. Even if the Farnan Farna did succeed in open ing a route, there is no guarantee, scarcely even likelihood with an eye to the past that he or his successor would be able to keep it open for a year. liutability is the keyword to Luristan affairs, ; and every extra intermediary is only an additional element of uncertainty. • It Is true that there is a better alignment for a road further to the West, but better only from an engineering point of view. It would be longer and it would not at all lie out of the range of the Dirakwand. It would rather offer a perpetual al luring bait to them, and they would have no vested interests of their own in it to act as a restraint on their natural instincts. The Dirakwand problem could be practically evadedevaded by adopting a route through ^usht-i-Kuh and the territory of the Fath-i-Sultan. But the journey would be some 5 days longer and the large river of the Semarra or Kerkha would have to be crossed twice. I wrote to the Indian Government on the advisability of temporarily instituting this route, but the question had to be set aside as I failed at that time to get into touch with the Wall of Risht-i-Kuh. Quite recently, however I have received assurance from him of his readi ness to co-operate. The terms he indicates - 100 sov/ars and the construction of serais - are formidable, but he expresses a great desire to talk the matter over with me personally and it might be possible to secure some modifications. For the other half of the route (Semarra to Khuramabad) I hold signed agreements from the Fath-i-Sultan. He is content with 30 sowars costing in all 750 tomans (say £130) for 6 months. It is, I believe, a mere question of money-and the Wali and the Path Suitan are the two most stable powers in this quarter of ^ersia. This though recommended only as a temporary ex pedient would afford an outlet for trade, prove to the Dirakwand that they do not entirely dominate the situa tion, and can even be ignored,, and put us in friendly contact with the most important local potencies. For our permanent establishment at Luristan how ever our soundest policy is, I am convinced, to tackle and settle the Dirakwand problem. It would give us the shortest route, do much to pacify Luristan, secure us a more than local prestige, and earn us at least a caricature of gratitude from the Lurs themselves and the inhabitants of the neighbouring towns. Of course arrangements with the Dirakwand for the institution and security of the route can only follow a satisfac tory vindication of our claims for justice against the tribe, of which might not they form an integral part? If there is a probability of the Farnan Farna*s really remaining in charge of the joint Government of Kermanshah and Luristan for 2 or 3 years, which even withoutwithout the information supplied by Sir A. Hard- inge, would hardly be likely, it might be well to take advantage of any private friendship which he professes towards us, to secure his assistance in making arrangements for the opening of the road. I would deprecate however putting the con duct of negotiations into his hands, by which we should lose all credit in the eyes of the tribes, for independence and the capacity of managing our own affairs. It is needless to urge the neces sity of guarding against dealing with the Farnan Farna or any one else in this matter, as a Persian Government Official, for the Persian Government would probably deduee a right, from this circum- stance to attempt interference in our relations with the tribes, whenever in the future it suited them to do so. I am not sure that the Farnan Fama is per sonally so indispensable as he would have one believe, or that whatever attraction co-operation with us offers him could not be brought to bear withwith equal force on a successor. The important point in this connection is how far the Governor enjoys the good graces of the Teh eran Authorities, or is able to be independent of them. §10. On the contrary I had much trouble on the way up 'dth the Itilrs; but I thought that the experiment having been once successfully carried out, would be safer and easier in the repetition. I agree with the Farnan Farna's dictum which is itself an additional reason for discarding the elaborate story to which he has given credit. 3. This concludes the examination of the situa tion as it presented itself to Captain Williams in March. Later events have done little to simplify the issues. Sir Arthur Hard Inge's despatch No. 109 / 5 d/. 17 -- shows however that the idea suggested of 05 working through a combination of Fazil Khan (sagwand) and Mir Haji has had to be abandoned. Still later the illusive success of the Farnan FarFarm in capturing certain of the Mira has monopolised attention. The Farnan Farna's success I regard as very equivocal. He may succeed in the course of time in securing all the offenders. On the other hand he very probably will not. If he does succeed the major share of the prestige in Luristan accruing from success will very pro perly attach to him and not to us. His late coup which was largely of the nature of a 'coup manque' is likely to indefinitely postpone the capture of the remaining cuplrits. Whether or not we give guarantees for the safety of certain individuals whom it suited our book to spare and employ, would, in my opinion, have very little ef fect. As far as I gather it has been in general deter mined to accede to the Farnan Farna's taking what ac tion he thinks best, when he thinks best, and to deal with questions piecemeal as they come up. It is dif ficult to see that any other course is open in view of the postulates which have been accented.© An application of pressure to the Persian Govern ment to organize or to allow us to organize measures of reprisal by enlisting the assistance of the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh, or the Bakhtlarl or others has been ruled out as inexpedient. This plan would afford the only means of settling the question of discipline, by on a basis on which the condescension of the tribe and The inability of the Persian Government to bring armed force itself to bear on the tribe has been recognized. The importance of avoiding causing injury to the susceptibilities of the Farnan Farna, as a prospective Prime Minister has come under consideration and been subscribed to. 4. Relieved of the necessity of formulating an active policy there are perhaps only two possible fu- ture cases, which it is worth while to face and con sider. force, and of arbitrarily initiating the trade route blackmail would have no place. TheThe one is that of the Faman Farna’s failure to push matters to a satisfactory termination. Tnis eventuality when it is judged to have arisen, will demand a fresh consideration of the whole question in the light of existing circumstances. The second case is the extremely hypothetical one of the Farnan Farna*s shortly attaining success. Given all the offending Mira In the Farnan Farna's hands, what line then should our demands take? The gravity of the offence, and still more the re-establishment of our prestige in Lurlstan, Arabis- tan and the adjoining countries, make some exercise of capital punishment imperative.. The difficulty at once presents itself of de termining who are (in Colonel Douglas*s phrase) 'the principal offenders', and excepting the men them selves I douht whether there is any one existing quali fied to give a just decision on this point. We might of course demand an arbitrary number of executions, and the delivery of the remaining culprits into our hands for transportation or other treatment.With a view to gaining some hold on Mir Haj i, wno is I think the most practicable of the Mirs we might spare his son and at the same time we should condone Mir Tatar's share in the affair. They both till the crisis professed to be peace- makers, and might be given the benefit of their pro fessions, For a Dirakwand Mir, Mir Tatar is a man of influence, and he might be useful. Before re leasing anyone we might extract an agreement from meiL, and from the rest of the tribe, for the pro tection of the road, all the details of pay and obli gations being drawn up on an equitable basis, and set down in full. I do not think that the bulk of tribes are ill disposed to the road project. The difficulty hith erto has been the hopeless entanglement of jealousy, suspicion and conflicting interests existing between the numerous nominal chieflets all claiming equality of rights. We might keep a few selected hostages under sentencesentence of death or transportation, but to be re leased after 2 or 3 years if the work of the road had been carried on satisfactorily. I still incline to think that the road once fairly started could be kept going, but this is a point on which there is room for great difference of opinion. * It should also be remembered that we should still have the Beharwand and Lalawand sections to come to | terms with. 5. Before closing I may add that my latest ad vices from Dizful received to-day state that the Gov ernor (i.e. Farnan Farna) had released Mir Haji Khan and Kat Khuda Bevani (presumably the Beharwand) and that subsequently he sent Mir Haji*s son to Kerman- * shah. The last move had brought Mir Haj i back to Knur- amabad to enquire its meaning. Earlier reports re ceived a week ago stated generally that the Farnan ! Farna had dismissed the Mirs at the same time making themthem responsible 'for the road', and the payment of the revenue, and that Government agents had also been despatched to their country to receive the latter. All these statements of course require confirma tion. I have &amp;c., (Signed) D. L. R.

I an. not sure of his name but I have olten talked with him, and have not the least hesitation in indicating him as one of the most acti ive spirits in the afiairs which lead up to the catastrophe. In view of the clearness of this one instance, it is with considerable surprise that I find myself unable to claim certain acquaintance with the subjects of any of the remaining portraits. Colonel Douglas is wrong in supposing that the white- bearded man is Mir Haji Khan. Nos. 2, 8 and 11 from the left of the line are the least unlike Mir Kaji, but I do not think that he appears at all. i I am also unable to trace his son Mir Nazar 1 Ali Khan though it is conceivable that the young man No. 5 from the -i.elt of the line is intended to represent him. Nor do I see anyone resembling Mir Tatar (I have never j.eard the alias 'Taimur') of whose appearance I have a veryvery clear remembrance. most of the faces in the Photo have a familiarity for me, as being common Lur types, but they do not suggest themselves as those of the men r vho are wanted, many of whose faces I can recall to my mind very distinctly.

India upon certain claims by Lieutenant-Colonel Douglas and Lieuten'ant/Lorimer arising out of their recent expedition to Luristan. 2 As regards the claim of these two officers to wound pensions or gratuities, we are of opinion that the cases of both fall to he dealt with under Article 732 of the Civil Service Regulations, and therefore recommend that they may he granted such pension or gratuity as may he admissible upon the report of a Medical Board, under Articles 1504-1505 of Volume I, Part I, ot our India Army Regulations. 3 In respect of the enquiry of Lieutenant-Colonel Douglas as to whether His Majesty’s Government will assist him further by paying his travelling expenses from Tehran to London, as well as those of his servant, and by defraying the expenses of an operation on his injured arm, &amp;c., we are ot opinion that such expenses should he advanced to the officer in question. At the same time it appears to us that it is a matter for consideration whether the amounts should not he recovered in whole, or in part, from the wound pension or gratuity found to be admissible. But in view of the fact that the expenses, directly or indirectly, involved by the injury were, no doubt, much increased by the fact of its being received in an unsettled country, we do not wish to press for the recovery of the amount in full, if His Majesty’s Government consider that a reasonable claim exists for a grant on this account. 4 . It is, of course, understood that compensation on account of actual losses of property and expenditure incurred by the two officers will not be deducted from the wound pension or gratuity which may be granted.5. We note the intention that the expenditure on account of such wound pension or gratuity shall he shared in moieties between the Imperial and Indian Exchequers, and that it is intended, if possible, to recover the sums referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 of your despatch from the Persian Gove^v ment.

Lieutenant Lorimer expresses himself emphatically on the subject, but his views do not seem to be overstated, and they need no comment from me as I have little doubt that the Government of India will generally concur in them. I have sent a copy of the report to His Majesty’s Minister. No. 148, dated 18th April 1905. From— Lieutenant D. L R. Lorimer, His Majesty’s Vice-Consul. Ahwaz, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Offg. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to advert to paragraph 17 of the Persian Gulf Diary for the week ending 26th March 1905 relating to affairs in Luristan. It is there stated that the Farman Farma claims to have received a letter from the Foreign Minister informing him that His Britannic Majesty’s Minister has consented to operations against the Dirakwand being postponed for six months. It is not clear from the diary whether the statement is veracious. In the hope that it may not be, I venture to put forward a few remarks based on a considera tion of the situation in Luristan from a local standpoint Looking beyond the mere satisfaction for injuries received and the main tenance of our prestige in Persia generally, and viewing the matter in the light of local feeling, as we must do if all intention of ultimately carrying out any schemes in Luristan has not been abandoned, it is absolutely essential in my opinion that the most effective means of making our weight felt by the Lur tribes must be putin force. A subsidiary but equally important condition is that whatever steps are taken towards this end should be taken promptly. Our prestige with the Lurs was at the best only the traditional belief in the sanctity of the persons ot Europeans. It was believed that any ill-treatment would immediately call into play the tremendous forces which were supposed to he at the back ot every European. “ A European has been injured the world will take fire was the general comment after the recent occurrence. But a severe blow has since been dealt to this belief. Five-and-half months have passed and we. are as tar trom exercising any retaliation as ever—at least that .is the not unnatural view in Luristan. Nor may we flatter ourselves that the effects of this incident will be confined Luristan. It will undoubtedly afford an inspiration to the less settled o e •ab tribes which they will not be loth to accept. The Sheikh of Mohammerah Iking of the situation said, “ It will make it ver y dl ® cult for ^ us ^ Th otection of European travellers will be more difficult than here 0 0 • rabs too will want to be looting Europeans now that they have seen the su ss of the Dirakwand.” It is our misfortune to have to work through a wholly inefficient and made- late instrument which has for long been the laughing-stock of Luristan—the ‘rsiairGovernment lf we are to convert it into an effective means of asserting ir dignity and of re-establishing the doctrine of “ Nemo me impune lacessit 1 the general recognition of which it is alone possible for our agents to work or ’en travelTn the country, we must stimulate it to unprecedented efforts and forceit into action of which on its own initiative it is incapable. The restoration of kit lost or the payment of compensation by the Central Government will have no significance whatever locally. The situation now presents the following aspect to our friends and enemies in this part of the country. Up to the present, at least up to the 4th of April, we have failed to push forward the Governor of the Province our declared champion and avenger beyond Burijird. Troops have been collected; in Khurrarrabad, but they are part of a scheme which was matured before our affairs arose. A number of these troops with their leader the Salar Muazzam have now left Luristan and come to Arabis- tan for the purpose of collecting revenue from the Beni Turuf, a matter which solely interests the Persian Government. This force came down through the country of the Dirakwand, the tribe whom we want punished. The very chiefs who are to be seized on our account arranged for the safe conduct of the troops, were treated with every consideration and given presents in return for their services. They were assured of the good-will of the Farman Farma (probably a diplomatic lie); and Khanjan Khan has been specially enjoined not to molest them We are now asked to wait six months till the season is more favourable for our affairs to be attended to. Scarcity of supplies is the pretext, but this hardly stands in the light of facts. No grain worth speaking of is at any time grown in the Dirakwand country, but pasture is at all seasons plentiful. Within easy reach of the base of operations, Khurramabad, is the Sila Khor valley, a granary in itself. Kermanshah and Hamadan both grain-growing centres are not distant. Khurramabad itself has normally a considerable grain stock but the troops who have been kicking their heels there for the last five or six months have no doubt made a severe call on it. Dizful could very well support in the field the force which it now has at its gates. There is no reason whatever why operations should not take place at this season. The tribes themselves move at this time of the year. The Sagwand, Beranwand, and Hassanwand each possess far larger numbers than the Farman Farma will ever have at his command. So much for the appearances by which the public judge the situation. To remove them let the Farman Farma advance from Burijird and Khur ramabad and the Salar Muazzam turn about and face up the road which he has just come down. Then if these military displays were anything but the farce they are, they would have the game in their hands. The Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh is ready to co-operate, so I understand are the Bakhtiaries. If however these forces are to be called in, it is in every way desirable that it should be under our and not Persian auspices. It is difficult to exaggerate the evil effect which delay is having on our reputation in these provinces. Further delay will more than accentuate it. No one in Luristan or Arabistan believes that the Persian Government can take effective measures of revenge. Complaisance on our part at their dilatori ness will not stimulate the notion that we are merely their dupes, but that we are powerless to drive them while unable to take the direction of the affair into our hands. Setting aside delay too, we cannot but share in public opinion the discredit of such exploits as the Salar Muazzam’s fawning to the Dirakwand. Another incident of a like significance comes to me on very credible authority. About a month ago the Dirakwand are said to have brought a lot of our stolen property (estimated at 500 tomans worth) into Dizful and disposed of it to an individual in that place. Khanjan tried to intercept them, but they took an unusual route and crossed the river by rafts and not the bridge. There is another view which we cannot afford to overlook if w r e do not intend washing our hands of all future interest in Luristan. We have been for tunate in gaining the friendship of the man above all others who could be useful to us in working the projected road. Khanjan Khan is a man of acknowledged force of character and ability and more remarkable he is recognised in Very different quarters as a man of sincerity and a maintainer of his word. This is'■nf T sufficient to set him apart from any one in Luristan, except perhaps the Fath-i- Sultan. ^ This man has placed himself at our service and we have been in com munication with him for a year. Ihe connection so far has not proved a happy one for him An honourable desire to stand true to his relations with us has lost him the friendship of his brother and relatives and has condemned him to spend ing the hot weather in the plains, since he cannot move up-country without coming to terms with the Dirakwands. This policy must be extremely unpopular with his followers and the only hold which a Lur Chief has over these is the success and approbation of his actions and the factor of personal influence. It has earned him a snub from the Government who have ordered him to reverse his policy towards the Dirakwand, and his refusal to come up to Khurramabad with bis relations has met with disfavour. From the time I left his camp in May 1904 all through the hot weather his section went through a period of isolation and adversity; which was attributed by the tribesmen to Khanjan’s friendliness to me. This was no doubt not a true explanation but here the belief was more im portant than the fact. Khanjan maintains his faith in us and unsolicitedly declares his determination to abide by us. But unless we can do something to establish our own position or strengthen his decision seems likely to lead finally to the loss of his present place and the eventual breaking up of his power and party. It is scarcely necessary to say that such an example would debar us thereafter from forming any useful friendships in Luristan. Even now Khanjan’s adherence to us can only be regarded as a gambler’s stake, which few would care to lay. It is in effect preferring the chances of our ultimate (practical) ascendancy in Luristan to the mutable but much sought' friendship of the Persian Government and the alliance of his natural friends with serious possibility of in the meantime losing his tribal following and so working his own ruin. To return to the general question, the local circumstances which I have passed under review (which alone fall within my province) all argue in favour of bringing increased pressure to bear on the Persian Government more particularly on one or two points :— The urgency for prompt and active measures. If they lead to the Persian Government’s discomforture that is after all the only result which is generally looked for after delay. The necessity of making some show of hostility against the Dirakwand and not using and paying them as friends. The retention of all available troops in Luristan until matters are brought to a definite head. The exclusion of the Dirakwand from their chief source of supply—Dizful. This would be easy even for the Persians. But no attempt has been made to do so by the Azim-us-Sultaneh who has been sitting at Dizful for months. Khanjan who did try was ordered to desist. «. C.

My Lord:- In rny despatch No .87 of the 15th ultimo I had the honour to transmit to Your Lordship a despatch from Captain Williams respecting the complicity of the various Direkwend tribal sections in the attack on Colonel Douglas and Mr. Lorimer and I stated that I was inclined to think that Captain Williarns , proposals afforded the best basis under the circumstances for a $ settlement of the affair. Since then however I have received telegrams from Captain Williams reporting that the situation has entirely changed. He states that, when it was found that no real force was being produced against the tribes, Fazil Khan Sagwand, hitherto in opposition to Mehr Ali Khan whom Captain w illinms suspects to be the real instigator of the outrage, has altered his attitude, while the Birana- wand tribe have also broken out into rebellion against the Government. He estimates the total number of tribesmen now arrayed against the Shah's authority at e Marquess of Lansdowne, K.G., &amp;c ., &amp;c ., &amp;c ., 15,000who with the greater part of the Government troops has gone off in the direction of AraMstan, in or der, so it is said, to coerce the Beni Truf Arabs, though the Grand Vizier has informed me that he is to attack the Lurs from the south* It would how ever have, been necessary, even to bring about the settlement proposed by Captain Williams, that a strong Persian force should be stationed at Khora- mabad to keep the various tribal sections in order: and as owing to the exhaustion of the Persian Ex chequer and the Shah's journey to Europe it v/ill be extremely difficult to get any troops sent down to Luristan, I considered Captain Williams' continued presence at Burujird to be no longer useful and on the 24th ultimo authorized him to return to Kerman- Captain Williams informs me that, when the Fer- man Fermah resumes operations after the crops have been0 been gathered, it will in his opinion be essential to revert to the plan indicated in my despatch No .87, as he believes the effectual subjugation of the Direk- wends to be beyond the power of any force v/hich the Persian Government could under existing conditions t put into the field.

Five hundred tomans. has Under Secretary of State India Office.mmmmmmaamamrn mam mmoam ■'OBB has been taken of consulting Colonel Douglas on the matter, and a copy of that officer’s observations is also enclosed. Lord Lansdowne proposes, if Mr* Brodrick concurs, to authorise Sir A. Hardinge to agree to the arrange ment suggested hy Captain Williams, on the under standing that the son of Mir Namdar and the other principal culprits shall, when surrendered, be sub jected to exemplary punishment. His Lordship would, at the same time, inform Sir A. Hardinge of Colonel Douglas’ suggestion re garding a fine in rifles instead of in money. I am Sir Your most obedient humble ServantThe explanation of the outrage on Lieutenant Lorirner and myself as given hy the *Ferman Ferma' to Captain Williams will hardly hear investigation. (1) I should douht the 'Fath-es-Sultan* being concerned in the attack. I do not know him person ally, hut he had been very friendly to Lieutenant Lorimer, had given him an escort through his terri tory in the spring of last year, and was I believe anxious to be on friendly terms with us. It is very probable that 'Mehr Ali Khan', Sagwand', and the 'Begler Begi' were implicated i^the affair. (2) Several of the men mentioned by Captain Williamsthat His Majesty's Government recognizes the desira- hility of increasing and maintaining British in fluence in the South West corner of Persia, and nothing can he done towards the attainment of this object among the unruly tribes of 'Luristan' until they are convinced that outrages, such as that per petrated on Lieutenant Lorimer and myself will be followed by severe punishment to those concerned. If it had been possible to take advantage of the in cident to induce the Persian Government or, in their default, the 'Bakhtlaris* or the 'Wall of Pusllt-i- kuh* to thoroughly subjugate the strip of country which separates the territory of the two latter, v/e mightmight then have been able to take some definite steps towards opening up the important trade road between 'Khuramabad' and 'Dizful' and establishing some system of road guards along it. As it is the inci- dent has shown the impossibility of entering into any engagements with these tribes so long as the country remains in its present state. I do not therefore consider the arrangement pro posed by Captain Williams at all satisfactory, but under the circumstances, and in consideration of the views put forward by Sir A. Hardinge, in his despatch it will probably be better to accept it. It should I think take the form of promising immunity from punishment to the men mentioned by Captain Williams, onlyonly on condition that the remainder of the 14 men whose names he has, are given up. I would however urge that if these men are brought in their punishment should he exemplary, and that the principal offenders at least should he put c to death. Nothing short of this will, in my opin ion, restore our prestige in 'Luristan* which has suffered severely from the perpetrators of the out rage being allowed to go for so long unpunished. As regards the fine proposed, 500 tomans seems an absurdly small sum and is about a tenth of the value of the things they took. A fine in rifles would be far more effective. It is probable how everhowever tnat the Persian Authorities may he trusted to extract from the trihe all that it is possible for tnem to get/, and it is hardly necessary for us to make any stipulations on this point, so long as we hold the central government responsible for the re payment of the sum advanced by His Majesty's Govern ment as compensation for losses incurred by us.

HarJinge to the Mar guess of Lansdowne.—[Received May 16.) (No. 87.) My Lord, Tehran, April 15, 1905. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith, with reference to previous correspondence, a copy of a despatch from Captain Williams respecting the punitive measures against the Direkwand Lurs, and the reported share of the various tribal sections concerned in the attack on Colonel Douglas and Mr. Lorimer. I am inclined to think that the proposals made in this despatch by Captain Williams afford the best basis of a settlement of the affair, especially as the only other alternative, our compelling the Persian Government to send a force sufficient to subju gate the country, presents, in view of its financial embarrassments and of the Shah’s impending journey, difficulties which can only be overcome by stronger measures than His Majesty’s Government would be probably disposed to sanction. My personal knowledge, however, of Lur affairs is second-hand only, and it would, I think, be desirable, before a final decision is arrived at, that Colonel Douglas, now in England, should be consnlted. The removal of the Ferman Fermah is, in my opinion, unlikely at the present juncture. The Ain-ed-Dowleh, who distrusts him, and indeed regards him as a dangerous enemy, will, I imagine, prefer that during his own absence in Europe the Ferman Fermah shall be kept busy in Luristan. Whether he will remain there for another three years, or even after the Shah’s return, is more doubtful, and depends upon political developments in Tehran, which, in view of the present state of His Imperial Majesty’s health, are more than ever uncertain and incalculable. I hear from a very well informed source that, should the Ain-ed-Dowleh fall, the Ferman Fermah might be summoned here to assume the Premiership. His sister, the Shah’s chief wife, who is on bad terms with the present Grand Vizier, is working for this object, and it is conceivable that such an issue might be less unwelcome to His Majesty than the recall of the Atabeg-i-Azam. This possibility is, in my opinion, a further reason for our falling in as far as is practicable in this Luristan business with the views of the Ferman Fermah, who appears for the present to be well disposed towards us, and with whom I am endeavouring to maintain very friendly relations. I have the honour to inclose herewith a paraphrase of a telegram which I have addressed to Captain Williams in reply to his despatch, and to request that your Lordship will, after the consultation which I have ventured to suggest with Colonel Douglas, communicate to me by telegraph your decisions as to the final instructions which I am to give Captain Williams on the subject of his proposals. As there seemed no prospect of serious operations against the Lurs being undertaken for some four months, I had directed Captain Williams to return for the present to Kermanshah. Your Lordship will observe that I am now keeping him for the present at Burujird. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) ARTHUL H. HALDINGE. Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Captain Williams to Sir A. Hardinge. gj r Burujird, March 26, 1905. I HAVE the honour to forward the following report on the present condition of affairs, in continuation of my cypher telegram No. 18 of to-day :— 1 ]qi s Highness Prince Ferman Fermah has been continuing his investigations into the Direkwand affair, and below 1 present his conclusions, which, after compaung with facts I know and have never communicated to his Highness, I think are probably correct. [1979 &lt;/—9]2. On the 24th March, Se Mahdi Khan, the senior Hassanwand Chief, paid me a visit. He assured me that Mehr Ali Khan Sagwand and the Beglar Begi were the chief instigators of the whole affair, and that the warnings of the latter as to the danger of the road were mere bluff. He further added that both Mehr Ali Khan and Beglar Begi had each received a share of the spoil. There are horses here now which are said to be part of the stolen property, and were found in Mehr Ali Khan’s stables when he was arrested. Se Mahdi Khan also told me that Beglar Begi had received a telescope from the Direkwands, and seemed very anxious to have one himself. I am well aware that one has to consider that these people are lying in every com munication they make, but local gossip has steadily associated Mehr Ali Khan and Beglar Begi with the affair from the time it occurred’' till now. Colonel Douglas and Lieutenant Lorimer strongly suspected them, and asked me to look out for evidence against them. 3. Ihe same day, after seeing Se Mahdi Khan, 1 saw Herman Ferntah, and he gave me some of his conclusions after seeing Se Mahdi Khan, Sartip Reza Khan (see para graph 36, p. 34, of Memorandum No. 233, Bushire, the 26th July, 1904, from Major Cox to L. W. Dane, Esq., forwarding Lieutenant Lorimer’s Report), Azam-ed-Dowleh, Governor of Khoremabad, and various of his emissaries who have returned from Fazil Khan Sagwand, &amp;c. He said as follows :— At the time Colonel Douglas and Mr. Lorimer were in Khoremabad Mozaffer-uJ- Mulk had just been dismissed, and his partizans were creating disorder to call attention to the loss^ sustained by his dismissal. His great friends were the Fath-es-Sultan, Mehr Ali Khan Sagwand, and the Beglar Begi. (I may say here that the Herman Fermah states that it was owing to his firm conviction of their complicity in the Direkwand affair that he caused the arrest of Mehr Ali Khan and Beglar Begi.) further, it is known that Mozaffer-ul-Mulk spent the first three nights after he became mazul (k^., recalled) with 4 ath-es-Sultan in Alishter, and, further, it is a known fact that Mehr Ali Khan was there also for one night. Mozaffer-ul-Mulk gave Mehr Ali Khan and 4 ath-es-Sultan receipts for large amounts of unpaid taxes, and 4’erman 4 ermah affirms that the robbery was planned during this meeting in order to throw discredit on the incoming Governor, namely, the 4’erman Fermah. Continuing, he said it is a known tact that there are two parties in the Direkwands, one friendly with 4 azil Khan Sagwand, and the other with Mehr Ali Kffian Sagwand, and whenever either of these men is friendly with the Governor his party amongst the Direkwand help the Governor, or at any rate abstain from molesting him. This finished the interview lor the 24th, but to-day his Highness again sent for me, saying that he had very important news which had just come in from^Azam-ed-Dowleh of Khoremabad. it was really a statement from Mir Haji through Fazil Khan of his sons’ part in the affair. Mir Haji is the Chief of the 4 azil Ivhan side of the Direkwands. His version is that Lieutenant Lorimer made the agreement for the double journey, through the intermediary of Khanjan Khan, with Mir Rustam Khan, son of Mir Haji, and he was brought up in safety to Khoremabad. With Mir Rustam Ivhan were his brother, Mir Nazar Ali Khan, Mir Barkhordar Khan, and the brother of Mir Haji, Mir Mehr Ali Khan. All these men belong to the section which is friendly with Fazil Khan, and consequently they are enemies of Mehr Ali Khan Sagwand. After Mr. Lorimer had arrived at Khoremabad, Mehr Ali Khan Sagwand wrote to the son of Mir Namdar i^Mir Namdar was the other big Chief of Direkwands, and was friendly to Mehr Ali Khan. Mir Namdar is reported to have died just at this time. Ferman Her mail has not got the name of his son), Mir Tata, and Mir Sardar, saying something to the following effect: “ Look here ; here is Mir Rustam Khan and his lot going to take the English ^Minister down to Disful, for which they will receive much money and presents, while you, my friends, are quite out of it. You must go and insist on having your share, or you will lose all honour as men,” Ac. As a result of this letter the son of Mir Namdar collected a strong following, among them being Mir Tata and Mir Sardar, and probably others whose names I have not got now, and, setting out, joined Mir Rustam with Colonel Douglas and Lieutenant Lorimer after Shali-in-Shah, or at any rate after they had commenced the journey under the protection of Mir Rustam Khan and Co. The arrival of the son' of Mir Namdar and Co. was quite a surprise to Mir Rustam, so it is affirmed. The son of Mir Namdar told Mir Rustam that they were going to loot the Englishmen and kill them so as to leave no trace of the affair. To this Mir Rustam strongly objected, as he had sworn on the Koran to take them in safety. That night the two parties had a consultation, and matters became very heated, so much so that at last Mir Rustam wastold that unless he and his party agreed they would be attacked also. Jhen Mn Rustam, seeing that he could do nothing, as the son of Mir Namdar had brought a much stronger force, consented to stand in with them, on the understanding that neither of the Englishmen was killed or wounded in any way, and also that they be given a horse apiece and enough food to reach Khoremabad. To this the other smc consented, and wanted to start looting at once; but Mir Rustam refused, as he an as afraid the Englishmen might be accidentally killed in the darkness. Rext morning, when loading up, they started looting, and, owing to Lieutenant Lorimer and ( oloiiel Douglas drawing pistols, they were wounded, not with the intention of killing them, but simply to prevent them making use of their firearms. The Direkwands also say that one of their Mirs was wounded in the leg by Mr. Lorimer, and afterwards died. I believe there is a good deal of truth in the above, lor the following icasons - (1.) From what I remember, Colonel Douglas and Lieutenant Lorimer said there was one Mir (presumably Mir Rustam) who seemed friendly, but said he could not help them, and advised them to give up their things quietly. (2) Also, from what Colonel Douglas and Mr. Lorimer said, the accompanying escort was much increased just before the outrage, and they wondered where they had come from. (These were probably the followings of the son ol Mir Namdar, IVm ata, Mir Sardar, and Co.) , . f (3.) Also I believe, from Ferman Fermah’s manner (and I have some experience ot him now), that he was giving me what he believed to be the truth just as he had received it. , ^ . (4.) All the accounts from the time of the outrage to the present day agree in saying that Mehr Ali Khan Sagwand was the cause of the whole allair. (5 ) The engagement for escort having been made through Khanjan Khan with the section friendly to him, they would not be likely to break their oath except under pressure, as that would put Fazil Khan against them, and he is too strong a man to do that lightly. . . , , &lt;■ ( 6 .) To my mind the most important points are (1) the attitude of the son ot Mir Haii before and after the outrage, and (2) it is true that alter starting they were joined by a second party of Direkwands larger than the first party For tins it is necessary that Colonel Douglas or Lieutenant Lorimer should read the above and see how it fits in with the facts. If it does fit, then it is probably true for I have never given Ferman Fermah any facts which would have enabled him to fabricate it. Ii.uo been most reticent for this very reason. . . . . . . . 1 If after perusal of the above with Colonel Douglas you think the statement of the old escort is true, then it becomes necessary to determine how we shall deal with the two secuons.^e a£ter ta]king it over with the Ferman Fermah : We should assure Mir Haji, the Chief of the Fazil Khan section, that we would not press the punishment against his son and the Mirs associated with him i . , Cl ) They will give up the son of Mir Namdar and all the Mirs who were associated with him. (I should assume that these were all the Mirs whose names we have, with the exceptions of Mir Rustam Khan, Mir Nazar Ah Khan, Mir Barkhordar Khan, and Mir Mehr Ali Khan.) (?') And will pay a fine not to exceed 500 tomans. .. , (Ferman Fermah says that, if put at more, they would absolutely refuse. He says iat this in cash is a big sum for them.) each It is quite on the cards that the two sections may in this way be set against each other, and^as Mir Haji would have the help of Fazil Khan, he would probaWysucce^ In auv case a large force will be necessary in Khoremabad to overawe I azil Mian an i Mir Haji and make them see that it will be to their interest to deliver up the other side quickly conclusion that the whole thing is probably made up and does not lit^n Th the ^ts, 1 am afraid that unless thel^mn Govern^ .s forced along in some drastic manner we must e prep.ir Persian soldieriTcan indefinitely.

Hardinge to the Marquess of Lansdowne.—(Received May 16.) (No. 93.) My Lord, Tehran, April ]8, 1905. WITH reference to my despatch No. 61 of the 21st ultimo, inclosing a translation of a note from the Mushir-ed-Dowleh as to the strength of the. force available for the Ferman Fermah’s Luristan expedition, I have the honour to transmit herewith a copy of a despatch from Captain Williams on the same subject, and of my reply. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge receipt of your despatch dated the 21 st March, with one inclosure. I presume the Mushir-ed-Dowleh means Khoremabad when he says “ the garrison of that place consists of two regiments and 500 cavalry.” The facts are, that in Khoremabad there are (1) the Kerind Regiment; (2) a part of the Khamseh Regiment; (3) and perhaps 300 cavalry. 2 . As for Salar-i-Moazzem, he has vanished in the direction of Arabistan, but although he had two regiments, 500 cavalry, and two guns, he was afraid to go through the Direkwand country, and went by a route further west. 3. Ferman Fermah’s camp consists of his personal servants and odd batches of sowars from Kermanshah, making in all perhaps 300 men. 4. If you consider that the Persian Government cannot be forced to send even 5,000 men to overawe the section who are inclined to save themselves, it might be advisable to get the Prime Minister to order the Ferman Fermah to move against the Lurs immediately, and the inevitable defeat would bring it home to the Persian Government that the force here is insufficient. Of course, this involves sacrificing the Ferman Fermah, as he would doubtless be dismissed after a defeat. On the other hand, although the Prime Minister would make no difficulty about ordering him to attack at once (he is doing so now) I doubt ■whether his Highness would obey him. The enmity between these two is the great stumbling block. Ferman Fermah himself says that the present object is to give him insufficient force so that he may suffer defeat, and then they will send someone with sufficient force to finish the business. When the other man has succeeded, His Majesty the Shah will be informed of the incapability of the Ferman Fermah, and the latter will then probably lose everything. I do not think the present Prime Minister w ill send sufficient force as long as Ferman Fermah is Governor-General, unless he is forced to do so. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) ARTHUR H. HARDINGE.

I have consulted a surgeon about ray ana, in which I was wounded in October last, whilst travelling on duty un der the orders of His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, under circurastancos which have already been reported. The opinion now given rae, is that, in its present state, the arm will always be so weak as to be practically useless, and that an operation is necessary before I can regain the use of it. Tnis operation will cost me a fee of 50 guineas, in addition to the expense entailed by a stay of sorae M..;e in a Nursing Home or similar establishment, and the fees I have already paid for consultation. I have also boon obliged, on account of the injury. not. only to incur the expense of the journey to England myself, but also to bring a servant with me, which add ed considerably to the cost of the journey. Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. II am aware that Sir A.Hardinge has asked the Per sian Government for the sum of ,21,000 to he divided be tween Lieutenant Lorimer and myself as conipensation for injuries received, and I presume that this will reach us in course of time. I would however submit that my wound having turned out to be so much more serious than was at first anticipated, and the injurybeing in all probability of a permanent character, this amount of , compensation is wholly inadequate, and the larger pro portion of it will be swallowed up in travelling ex penses and doctors' fees. Under these circumstances I have the honour to en quire whether His majesty’s Government, taking into consideration the exceptional nature of the case, will assist me by paying the travelling expenses between Tehran and London of myself and servant, and also whe ther I can recover from them the very considerable sums which I shall be obliged to disburse in fees for the operation to be performed on my arm, and for ixiedical attendance generally.

It is at present only a path, which foot- passengers or travellers riding unloaded animals can use, the latter, I gather, with ^ difficulty, but the Nasir-ul-Mulk was of opinion that it could easily be converted into a caravan track.

M. le Ministre, Tehran, February 16, 1905^ I HAVE received your Excellency’s note of the 11th ultimo, respecting the attack on the British Consul and the Military Attache to His Britannic Majesty’s Legation by the Direkwand Lurs. From the statements made therein I understand that your Excellency has forgotten the contents of my note of the 23rd November last, transmitting to you a copy of Consul Lorimer’s letter, addressed to Abdur Rahim Khan, the Beglar Begi. I therefore have the honour to refer your Excellency to the above-mentioned i note, and the letter written by Mr. Lorimer after the incident, and to remind you | that in that letter it is distinctly stated that, when he was starting, the local | authorities prevented him, and clearly informed him of the insecurity of the roads \ and the possible dangers. The officers in question had undertaken that untimely journey for their own reasons and the incident happened, and afterwards they stated in writing that they were previously informed of the insecurity of the roads, and they were urged not to go ; but they themselves wished to go, and that no responsibility rests with the local authorities on that account. I have no doubt that after a little consideration of the present and my previous notes, your Excellency Avill agree with me that in no way the Persian authorities can be regarded as responsible in this matter. Notwithstanding the above fact the Persian Government has, as your Excellency is aware, taken efficient steps and sent special officials to arrest and punish the offenders, and they have already begun operations.

I HAVE had the honour to receive your note of the LOth instant respecting the attack in Luristan on Colonel Douglas and Vice-Consul Lorimer. The correspondence to which your Excellency alludes in it took place during my absence from Tehran, but I have referred to it, and I have also made inquiries from Colonel Douglas, who has drawn up for me the inclosed Memorandum on the subject. Before offering any further observations I should wish to draw your Excellency’s attention to a slight but important discrepancy between the letter written by Colonel Douglas for the protection of the Beglar Begi of Khoremabad, and the conclusions drawn from that letter in your Excellency’s note under reply. Y our Excellency states, on the strength of Colonel Douglas’ letter, that no blame attaches to the officials of the Government (“ Karguzaran douiat”). A reference to Not print'd.the Colonel s letter however, shows that the words employed by him were “ Kargu- zaran-i-Ayalat, officials of the district, or local officials: Everyone knows that it was not the faul of the Beglar Begi of Khoremabad, or of the other petty officials of the district that the road from Khoremabad to Disful has been for the last four years interrupted, and that the whole country traversed by it is in a state of insurrection 1 he responsibility lor a state of things which obliges travellers to apply for a safe ! . pr 0 7 m01 ;‘! who are powerless to afford them safety, but t ocal tribes, rests with the Central Government at Tehran which has been repeatedly urged by His Majesty’s Legation ever since the transfer three years ago of ' -b 8 t . onoesslon to flle 'transport Company to take such steps for the pacification of Lunstan as would make it possible for the Company to realize its Concession, but has not thought fit to comply with our requests.

It is, therefore not to the Beglar Begi or to any other helpless minor authority, but to your Excellency yourself, that I have been directed by my Government to apply for compensation to the injured officers.

I mean, how many soldiers and guns are with it, or on the way there, and whether they are considered by it sufficient for the object in view. I would also urge very strongly that the authors of the outrage should he caught and brought to Tehran, that the troops should be kept and,^ if necessarv, strengthened at Khoremabad, and the Ferman Fermah and his army not recalled, achieved 1110 ^ 0rdered to continue tlie operations until this object has been I avail, &amp;c.

This increases the Persian Government’s difficulties, as they were relying for help from him. The Ferman Fermah was yesterday at the telegraph office communicating with Tehran, and I learned the result, which is as follows :— The Grand Vizier insisted that there were already 10,000 men with all necessaries here and refused to believe the Governor-General’s details. The gist of Ins reply was that the Governor-General was afraid, and he ended by ordering him to start immediatelv The Governor-General considers this final, and that he must now go out and take his chances. He informed me privately that he could guarantee me neither food nor protection. I have to-day written to him officially asking whether he can guarantee me food, and saying that I am read\ to pay foi ih s icie 1S food, and he therefore cannot do this, he says he will ask the Government what answer to give me. He advised me to take supplies for men and animals for two months; this would require more than forty extra mules, even if I could procure , icm. He hinted to me that unless His Majesty’s Government present an ultimatum to the Persian Government, latter will not furnish money necessary to effect capture of the authors of the outrage. He also says that Mir Ah Khan was the instigator of the attack, and that they have found a stolen gelding in his stables. Also that he has sent a portmanteau to the Path-es-Sultan. (3.) Sir A. Hardinge to Lieutenant Williams. /^ o ^ \ Tehran, February 16, 1905. ’ Yesterday the Mushir-ed-Dowleh showed me a telegram from the Ferman Fermah stating that owing to certain local conditions, I presume the capture ot Mir Ah K him Sagwand, he would prefer to postpone for three months the punishment ot the Hirekwands, when they reap the first crop, and operations would be easier. I answered that the Persian Government must he the best judge of such considerations; the responsibility for punishing the offenders was theirs, and His Majesty s Government could not share in it by advising as to the plan of campaign. But l must insist that no more procastination shall be permitted and that Ferman Fermah he told that within three months, or sooner, operations must be successfully carried out. I understand that His Majesty’s Government does not wish you to proceed beyond the base. Would there he difficulty about obtaining ordinary provisions at Khoremabad ? ( 4 .) Lieutenant Williams to Sir A. Hardinge. /^ o ^ \ Burujird, February 18, 1905. Perman Permah’s plea for three months is simply an attempt to shelve the matter for the present. He told me that the Grand Vizier had received the proposal svmpatheticallv He gives the necessity for punishing the Path-es-Sultan as one reason for delating, hut if he cannot go against the Direkwand it is hopeless for him to think of attacking the Fath-es-Sultan. Moreover, I should think he ought o attack the former before they have any chance of cutting the crops. The true “local conditions ” are that there is no food and a complete msuhiciency of men and ammunition. The Governor-General admits that if the Forsian Govern- ment would find the money the difficulty about food would disappear A would tak three months to bring the army up to sufficient strength.He has officially informed me that there will he considerable difficulty about provisions at Khoremabad. He is anxious for me to stop at Khoremabad and gives this as his reason. Please impress on the Persian Government that they are responsible for my getting supplies. It would he foolish to go beyond the base with the present force, hut when it is increased, unless I go forward, the Governor-General can report that the authors of the outrage are killed in action, and we shall he unable to check his statements. Please give me definite orders on the subject. (5.) Sir A. Hardinge to Lieutenant Williams. (Iso. 9.) Tehran, February 21, 1905. Immediate attack on Hirekwands is clearly impossible, and if the collection of the necessary provisions and troops will take three months we must, however, reluctantly acquiesce in the postponement. I am telegraphing to ask authority for you to proceed with Prince beyond the base. ( 6 .) ideutenant Williams to Sir A. Hardinge. (No. 10.) Burujird, February 21, 1905. Governor-GeneraFs three months have now become seven. His present plan is to wait till September when the Beranawand and Sagwand move down, and then, having seized the only available pass, to hold their families and flocks as hostages while the fighting men move on to punish the Direkwand; the families, &amp;c., would only be released when success had been attained. If he succeeds in stopping the families, &amp;c., this would make us most unpopular among the remaining tribes, but unless His Majesty’s Government is ready to force the Persian Government it is the only plan which holds out any chance of success. With his present force the Perman Permah can do nothing now or in the immediate future. He has just shown me a telegram from the Mushir-ed-Dowleh stating that you have accepted the proposal to postpone the punishment of the Hirekwands until after the harvest. The Governor-General says this means another six months. (7.) Sir A. Hardinge to Lieutenant Williams. Tehran^ February 25, 1905. Inform Prince that he is under a misunderstanding as to what I said to the Mushir-ed-Dowleh, and quote to him my telegram to you, No. 9, of the 21st instant. I told the Mushir we would wait three months and no longer, and that we could not possibly allow the procrastinating tactics adopted in the Urumia murder case, which resulted in the Persian Government having to pay that of the United States an indemity of 37,000 tomans. I have asked officially for details of the guns and troops supplied to the Prince, and hope for an answer shortly. I should strongly deprecate any action on the Prince’s part which could lead the Lurs to believe that he had abandoned or indefinitely postponed operations.Under Secretary of State, \ India Office. Sir:- I am directed Uy the Marquess of Lansdowne to transmit to you herewith copy of a despatch from His Majesty's Minister at Tehran on the subject of the recent attack hy Direkwand Lurs on Colonel Doug las and Mr. Lorimer. It will be observed that the Firman Fima is organising an expedition for the punishment of the offending tribe, and that Sir A. Hardinge considers that, if he fails, the task must be entrusted either to the Bakhtiari Chiefs or to the Ala-ed-Dowleh. Lord Lansdowne would be glad to be favoured with the views of the Secretary of State for India on this subject. His Lordship proposes, if Mr. Brodrick concurs, to approve the terms of the note addressed by Sir A. HardingeSir A. Hardinge to the Persian Government regarding the compensation to he paid to Colonel Douglas and Mr. Lorimer. I am. Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant,Copy ( 0 . 12 . TEHERAN. January 13th, 1905. My Lord:- I have the honour to transmit herewith a copy of a note which I addressed on the 12th instant on receipt of Your Lordship's telegram of the 9th, to the Persian Government, respecting the compensation k e paid to Lieutenant Colonel Douglas and to Mr. Vice Consul Lorimer for the outrage inflicted on them by the Direkwand Lurs. I have at the same time the honour to report that His Highness the Firman Firmah, after delays and endeavours to escape going which necessitated repeated representations by me here, left Kermanshah yesterday for Luristan. Mr. H. Rabino, who is on a visit here, believes that if he is supplied with the necessary funds, he may succeed with the forces at his disposal in punishing the offending tribe, but this optimism is not generally shared. I gather in fact from what I have heard in various quarters that the failure of the expedition would be viewed with complacency both Marquess of Lansdowne, K.G., &amp;c ., &amp;c ., &amp;c., byby the Grand Vizir and by the Firman Firmah himself, as the Ain ed Dowleh believes that defeat would dis credit the Firman Firmah, whilst the Firman Firmah hopes that it would lead to his being deprived of nis province, which will enable him to return after nis long exile to Teheran and replunge into Palace intrigues. Surgeon Lieutenant Williams accompanied His Highness, very much, I suspect from what I hear, against the Prince's wishes, at any rate as far as Khoremabad, which will be his base, and I have authorized him to leave Mr. Fairley the Acting Mana ger of the Imperial Bank of Persia, in charge of His Majesty's Consulate at Xermanshah till the re turn of Major Gough, who will quit Urumia on the 15th proximo. I had recently some talk on Luristan affairs with His Royal Highness the Salar ed Dowleh, who was deprived, as Your Lordship may remember, of the Gov ernor Generalship of Arabistan last spring, but who has now been reconciled to the Ain ed Dowlehby the promisepromise of promotion this year to Kerman, or if possi ble Khorassan. His Royal Highness was very sceptical as to any satisfactory result attending the Firman Firmah's operations, or indeed those of any other Per sian General in the present state of the country, 'be cause* he said, and then checking himself, added 'there 'are a good many becauses, and you know them as well 'as I do, so that there is no need to specify them.' 1 He thought it would be wiser of us to abandon the idea I of establishing a trade route through the country ly ing between Khoremabad and Disful. The Lurs, he said, were so savage and stupid that they would always be tempted to sacrifice ulterior advantage for the sake of immediate plunder, and although an energetic Governor, such as the Ain ed Dowleh had been, might keep the road open for a few months or even a year or so, it could only be made permanently safe by a tho rough subjugation and pacification of the country, a task which under present circumstances was beyond the capacities of,the Persian Army. His Royal Highness bel ievedbelieved tnat an equally good trade route, perhaps a better one, might be developed by the Persian Road and Transport Company if it diverged from the pres- \ ent route at Burujird, and carried its road in a South Easterly direction through the territory of the Chahar Lang Bakhtiaris, who like the Bakhtiari Trite in general were well disposed tov/ards the Eng- lisn. In reply to a question as to why this road had never before been frequented by through caravans, His Royal Highness said that it could not be so used until a bridge had teen built over the Abi Diz. I am making further enquiries on this subject. If the Firman Firmah fails in his expedition, tue only otner courses which I can recommend to Your Lordship are (1) that we shall insist on the Bakhtiari Khans being authorized by the Persian Gov ernment to undertake the punishment of the Direk- wands, and for this purpose be given the Government of Luristan for a definite term of years, or (2) if tnis is objected to on the ground that such a mea sure would be resented by the V a li of Pusht-i-Kuh, thatthat the Ala ed Dowleh, who has been successful in dealing with the Ilyat tribes of Xermanshah and Pars, should be charged with the pacification of Luristan. He is of all the Persian Governors the only man I know who would have much chance of success, but he is now in disgrace as a partisan of the Atabeg-i-Azam. He attributed, in a recent conversation with me, the pre sent state of anarchy into which Luristan has been al lowed to fall large^ to the perfidious policy adopted towards the tribes by successive Persian Governors, who had shaken all belief in their trustworthiness. They had invited Lur Chiefs to parleys under flags of truce, or after sending them as safe-conducts Korans on which they had sworn to keep faith with them, had then arrested them as soon as they had got them into their power, or had them 'accidentally shot' as they were leaving at the close of an interviev/. Nothing but a restoration of confidence by a straightforward policy on the part of the Persian Government would make it possible really to pacify the Lurs. I have &amp;c., (Signed) Arthur H, Hardinge.TEHRAN ■ c January 11th, 1905. Your Excellency:- 3 * His Majesty's Government have had under their consideration the reports furnished them by His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires respecting the attack by a section of the Direkvend tribe on his Majesty's Consul at Ahwaz and on the Military Attache of His Majesty's Legation at Tehran. They consider it reasonable that a liberal indemnity for the wounds and injuries inflicted by I Persian subjects on the representatives of a friendly State should be assigned to the latter in addition to the payment of the special expenses incurred by them in consequence of this outrage and the value of the property stolen from them. I am instructed accord ingly to request that the sum of £500, or its equival ent in Persian money, should be paid as compensation , t to each of the two officers. It may be more conveni ent to the Persian Government to spread the payment of this sum over a certain period than to pay it in ;i 8 Excellency lump Mu sh ir - ed -Dowleh, &amp;c „, &amp;c., &amp;c. ,lump at once, and I am therefore authorized to pro pose its payment in five quarterly instalments of * £100 each to Colonel Douglas and Consul Lorimer respectively, the first instalment to he paid on the 1st April next. I am at the same time to urge most earnestly the importance of early and energetic measures, not merely for the punishment of the guilty tribe, which will doubtless be the primary object of the Persian Government, but also for the pacification of the districts traversed by the Arabistan road, the Shah's concession for which cannot be properly work ed by the English Company holding it until reason able security for life and property is established along it. I need not refer to the numerous repre sentations on the disturbed state of this portion of the Province of Arabistan which His Majesty's Legation has over and over again submitted both to Your Excellency and to His Highness the Sadr Azam, and which have been answered to the effect that 'the necessary orders have been sent* and *the necessary measures.measures are being taken.' Notwithstanding these as surances and promises the reports which His Majesty's Legation has received from its Consuls and from Messrs. Lynch were to the effect that trade along the road was completely paralysed by the prevalent insecurity and that it would not be possible for the Road Company to commence operations under present conditions with any prospect of success. The efforts which His Majesty's Consul at Ahwaz has made with my approval to open up the road with a view to securing passage for Messrs. Lynch's goods rind to enabling the Road Company's agents to give effect to their concession by means of payments to the headmen of the districts traversed by it have only been partially succes^ul, and have now received a check owing to the outrage committed upon that officer, when travelling there in pursuance of this object, and upon Colonel Douglas who met and joined him at Khorremabad, by the escort supplied by the Direkvends. It has thus become evident that nothing short of the severest measures will make it possiblepossible for the Road Company to realize its con- t cession, and secure to our traders using the Arabis- tan route, - the shortest one from the sea to cen tral Persia, - the enjoyment of that protection for their commerce to which the Treaties between our two Governments entitle them. It is obviously not for me to point out to Your Excellency the best method to be adopted for pacifying this district, but I would venture to sug gest tnat tne Firman Firma should publicly announce that his operations are primarily directed only against that section of the Direkvends guilty of the attack on Colonel Douglas and Consul Lorimer, and that other tribes co-operating with him v/ill be rewarded. Further that if the guilty tribe surren ders the authors of the outrage for punishment they will be granted an amnesty subject to the payment of a fine, but that any of them resisting the Im perial troops will be treated as rebels and if tak en with arms in their hands, shot as such. I wouldwould .'also suggest for Your Excellency’s consideration the propriety of imposing a fine of say 500 rifles. This practice is not unfrequently resorted to in the case of similar wild tribes by the British Government and is found to be both an effective punishment and a guarantee for the future good behaviour of the offend ers . I have &amp;c. f (Signed) Arthur H. Hardingeoriginal Concession, to which we are a party, I believe, but owing to the Shua-es- Sultaneb being Governor of Shiraz, they do not care to exercise it unless it is confirmed by the present Government, as if they did take any action of such a description it would be certain to give cause of complaints from Ears to Tehran. They therefore ask you to he good enough to press on the Persian Government this point, and get the necessary confirmation. With reference to your despatch No. 13 of the 19th August with regard to the Kuhgelus, you are good enough to instruct me to open a discussion with the Chiefs as to forming a road guard under certain circumstances. In view of the clause in the original Concession granting them the right to protect their road, I thought that I could with advantage open up this subject. I found the two Chiefs, Sirdar Mufakhkham and Semsam-es-Sultaneh, most receptive, and quite willing to entertain the idea. I made them to understand that I was acting entirely on my own responsibility, but that the result of my discussion with them would be communicated to His Majesty’s Government. They considered that a body of 200 men should be put on the road, and to command them there should be a sarhang (colonel), two yavars (majors), and four sultans (captains); they would clothe, mount, and arm these men, and would give the best they could. They' would allow them to be inspected periodically by an officer from this Consulate or from the Vice-Consulate at Ahwaz, and they would be glad to have them drilled by Indian non-commissioned officers. To enable as many men to be made effective as possible, the men should be changed periodically and new men brought into the force. As regards the arms and ammunition, such as they have they acknowledge is out of date, and for modern purposes ineffective; they would be glad to get 200 rifles of new type, with an equivalent amount of ammunition, if His Majesty’s Government could induce the Persian Government to pass them into the country. The expenses of this road guard would be approximately as follows; these charges they would expect His Majesty’s Government to defray :— THE Bakhtiaris expressed very great concern at the outrage cn Colonel Douglas and Mr. Lorimer; they said that they were willing to undertake the pacification of the Lur country and the punishment of the offenders, but that to do this they must have a guarantee of the Governorship for a period of at least five years; they would also want arms and ammunition. The amount of cartridges they now had would probably only last them for some three or four days in a stiff fight. They complained greatly on the restrictions put on the importation of ai ms and ammunition generally, and the great disadvantage it places them in I found them in every way most anxious to do what they could to show His Majesty’s Government that they were thoroughly impressed with the desire to gain the Government’s confidence and consideration; they are much afraid that Messrs. Lynch Brothers may in some way make trouble for them with His Majesty s Govern ment. They are thoroughly imbued with the idea that, as regards the road, that firm does not deal honestly and straightforwardly with them. This is patent by the contents of the letter, copy of which I have inclosed in my despatch iNo. ob. In their talks they use no unmeasured language. 200 men, at 1,000 krans 1 Colonel . • 2 Majors, at 5,000 krans .. 4 Captains, at 2,500 krans Kraus. 10,000 10.000 10,000 200,000 Total 230,000 Or, say about 4,000^. per annum.

Sir, Ispahan, December 31, 1901.I notice that during the last ten years there has been an enormous increase in their wealth and general well-being. They have taken every advantage of the sale of the State property, and have bought up every bit they could within reasonable distance of Chahar Mahal and round about the districts of Behbehan and flam Hormuz. This latter has brought them into discussion with the Sheikh of Moham- merah, with whom they are not now on such good terms as they were, in consequence. ' If I might suggest a visit to them by Mr. Macdouall this spring, and a discussion with them and the Sheikh might smooth matters over; the enmity of these two tribes, friends of ours, is to be deprecated and removed if possible. The Khans have all built themselves good handsome houses, well furnished according to their lights, have made roads and got themselves carriages, so that they can now visit each other in their villages with ease. They also seem more contented, and one does not now see so many armed men about. From every point of view the tribes seem generally more prosperous and civilized. It is somewhat rare to hear of murders, and blood-feuds are practically a thing of the past. The Chiefs asked my advice as to getting an engineer out from home to make a road vid Bazuft to Chaster; they wanted this for the tribes in the bi-annual migration. I recommended that they should employ Mr. MacIntyre, a pensioner of the Telegraph Department, who now resides in Ispahan. They also spoke of getting a doctor, an Englishman, to be always with them, either in the Germsir, or Sarhad, and further talked of opening a school in Chahar Mahal for their boys: they wanted to have for this an Englishman also. On the doctor question they were very keen. I think it is most likely to be arranged. In Arabistan, Bakhtiari, and Chahar Mahal, the rains this winter have been very heavy, and everyone is hopeful for a bountiful harvest; in every direction every inch of ground which could be brought under cultivation was being tilled and sown. Although the Chiefs had promised Messrs Lynch Brothers, and had repeated this promise to me, to do their best to keep this road open I am very much afraid that it is impossible this winter. I made them thoroughly understand that it was a matter of great importance for our commercial interests that we should have a quick and cheap mode of transit from the sea to Tehran and Ispahan, and for this we had greatly counted on the Bakhtiari road but it had been of little assistance to us owing to the dearness of provisions on it, causing the muleteers to ask as much higher from Ispahan to Ahwaz as from Bushire to Ispahan. They were very much astonished at this, but said that this was an unfortunate year, as in Arabistan there was a partial famine. They had put up a tariff in the various caravanserais, and given strict orders that nothing more was to be charged ; if the charvadars were charged more than the tariff allowed, and would complain to them, they would have the culprits severely punished; they fully realized how important it was to do ail in their own interests to make this road as popular as possible. They asked in the event of war in Persia, and their services being required by us, would our Government supply them with arms and ammunition. I replied that in such an eventuality I had no doubt but that His Majesty’s Government would do all that was necessary. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) J.

Hardinge to the Marquess of Lansdowne.—{Received March 3 *) (No. 17. Confidential.) Mv Lord. Tehran, January 31, 1905. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith copies of despatches from His Majesty’s Consul-General at Ispahan respecting the journey undertaken by him last autumn to the Bakhtiari country, and his negotiations with the Bakhtiari Khans. , Your Lordship will observe from these reports that Mr. Ireece considers the condition of the Ispahan—Ahwaz road to be less had than he had been led to expect, and that be has concluded an arrangement with the Khans by which the latter undertake to pay Messrs. Lynch 3,000 tomans (500/.) for immediate repairs to the road on the 21st May next, and an annual sum of 1,000 tomans for upkeep. The Khans, however, ask that this expenditure should be supervised by a Representative of His Majesty’s Government, or that they should be given the right of withholding the 1,000 tomans in the event of their being of opinion that the money had not been properly expended, and they wish to be informed which of these alternatives will be accepted by Messrs. Lynch. I venture to think that it would be best to adopt the first, and to arrange wdth Messrs. Lynch that His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz should be instructed to include among his regular duties a supervision of the annual expenditure on the upkeep of the road. I would, however, beg your Lordship to telegraph to me as early as possible, for the information of the Khans, the decision to which vou may come on this point. „ _ . ,. , The very high charges, amounting to 375/. in three years, tor the painting ol two bridges which Mr. Preece reports as having been made by Messrs. Lynch, would certainly seem to justify a suspicion on the part of the Khans that tne expenditure which they are called upon to make good is not always as economical as they are entitled to expect. , , , n , • ^ ^ I have addressed a note to the Persian Government, but have as yet received no reply to it, respecting the complaints made by the Bakhtians o± depredations on the part of the Kuhgelu tribe. His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz has also addressed me on this subject. Your Lordship will observe that Mr. Preece estimates at about 4,000/. a-year (at the present rate of exchange it would be 3,800/.) the maintenance road-guard of 200 men under seven officers which the Khans would be prepared to furnish, and which they would agree should be inspected periodically by a British officer and drilled by Indian non-commissioned officers. , Your Lordship will note, with reference to my despatch No. °. f tb( ? 18tb instant, the readiness expressed by the Khans to undertake the pacification of Luristan and the punishment of the tribe guilty of the outrage on Colonel Douglas and Lieutenant Lorimer.

I HAVE the honour to report that I left here on the 29th October, accompanied^ by Major Cox and Mr. Grahame, to inspect the Lynch road through the Bakhtiari country in accordance with your instructions. Major Cox’s proposal to accompany me was unfortunate as it necessitated my recasting my plans entirely, and obliged me to return by exactly the same route as I traversed going; this was not altogether to be regretted, as I saw the road under two different aspects, viz., after it had been used by the tribes during the autumn, and then on my return after four days’ heavy rain such as T have never seen in the uplands of Persia before. To give a detailed account of the road as constructed by Messrs. Lynch Brothers would serve no useful purpose; suffice it to say that the so-called Ispahan-Ahwaz road starts from near the western end of the Darkish-Warkish Pass, about 100 miles from Ispahan, then runs through the hills to Alwani on the plain, about 45 miles from Ahwaz. The road there constructed is, according to Mr. Taylor, about 145 miles long. Messrs. Lynch Brothers and the Bakhtiari Khans look on this road from two entirely different points of view. The former, it appears to me, want to have and maintain a sort of Rotten Row in these hills—a road which can for the most part he galloped over; in fact, one of their representatives said to me, when speaking of the had repair that the road was in, that when first it was made such a thing could be done. The Chiefs, on the other hand, wanted a road made which would enable the tribes and caravans to pass over freely and without danger. ■ notice in one of their letters to the Foreign Office Messrs. Lynch quote me as saying that I estimate 5,500/. as sufficient to make this road; but rny idea then was to make a respectable caravan track which would encourage Persian charvadars to bring their mules on it and facilitate our commerce. It never entered my mind that the road was to be a good galloping ground for Messrs. Lynch Brothers’ representatives and the few casual Europeans who pass through Persia and use the road in their progress. In passing over the road, both coming and going, I looked at it very carefully and took special note of the complaints of Mr. Parry. I could see nothino* at any of these points to take exception to, the Chiefs themselves having made good the road in each case as far as Godar-i-Baiutak in accordance with their promise. Although had the road had a yearly sum spent on it, it would have been kept in much better repair, yet from end to end of it I saw but one spot which to my mind was positively dangerous, this was on the winter divergence near the top of Darkish- Warkish, where the road had fallen away leaving a precipice on the left hand, when going west, and a sheer rock on the right. I do not mean to say that there were not many other places which needed repair : Such as in the pass near Dopulum, comino- from Ardal, where the hillside has slipped away ; each side of the caravanserai at Shalil, where the road has been cut out of alluvial soil on the hillside; some of the approaches to the Godar-i-Balutak Bridge on each side; the Malamir end of the Rah-i-Sultani. Between Shalil and Deh Diz, going up to Mawareed Pass, some of the road over that rock was very bad, hut this is in the same state as I first saw it in 1895. From Jaru to Alwani some of the pass wants repairs. Those are all the points which struck me as really had from the point of view of a caravan road. The various charvadars I spoke to with reference to the road made no complaints, and I was told at Ahwaz the same thing. To repair the road and put it into the same state as it was when Messrs. Lynch handed it over to the Chiefs would involve the expenditure of a large sum which, in my opinion, would he simply throwing money away. Such as clearing the stones away, &amp;c. ; most of the road is on or along hills which are a mass of stones or consist of soil and stones mixed ; after heavy rains, such as 1 experienced, the latter becomes mud, mixed with stones, a large portion of which are left on the surface. After clearing away, the next heavy downfall of rain would find the road in the same plight. At other places where the road is practically all stones, the mules would kick them up again, and the travelling Hooks always send plenty down from the hillside to augment the above. With very much difficulty I have succeeded in inducing the Khans, firstly, to titer the proposal made to you, and in the place ol giving a yearly sum for repairs ofagents, agi’eed. sum of 5,000 kr. and a sort of corvee of 1,000 labourers (a system which I do not believe would work), to give Messrs. Lynch 1,000 tomans a-year for these repairs. The idea of this change was given to me by one of Messrs. Lynch’s own and as it was to my mind reasonable I suggested it to the Khans, who Jlecondly, I have induced them to give for the immediate repairs of the road a »,000 tomans ; this will he paid two months after the Norouz, when it is time to start rork. As you will see by the inclosed letter which the Khans have written to me, the yearly 1,000 tomans will come into force when the road has been repaired. *1 could not venture on any estimate for the road, hut set myself to get from the Khans the most I could, and I venture to think that if this sum is expended on the road pure and simple a very great deal of effective work can he done. The nearest parallel to such work that I have acquaintance with in this country is a working party of the Indo-European Telegraph Department under an inspector doing repairs to the lines. The following are the charges which are sanctioned by the Government of India :— Inspector’s pay, 20J. per mensem Per diem charges .. Rupees 300 .. 90 Kraus. Three mules, at 3^ krans per diem Four mules, at krans per diem, for labourers’ tents, tools, &amp;c. 390 = 1,450? 315 420 Labourers, say 40, at 2 krans each per diem .. 2,185 2,400 Total for one month .. . . • • • » 4,585 At the above rate a working party could do six months’ work and there would remain a balance in hand of 2,500 krans for purchase of tools and general con tingencies. and, if that was not a sufficient margin, five months on the above lines could be arranged for, leaving a balance of 7,000 krans for above contingencies; as regards the yearly 1,000 tomans, by reducing the labourers to twenty, and cutting off one mule, the monthly expenditure would he reduced to 3,065 krans, which would leave a balance of 800 krans for contingencies, allowing for working for three months, amply sufficient I take it for any work likely to arise. Over and over the Khans evinced the utmost distrust of Messrs. Lynch Brothers, and suggested that we should supervise the disbursement of these 3,000 tomans so that they might be sure that the money was expended for the purpose it was given, and they reserve their rights to withdraw the 1,000 tomans a-year, should they be of opinion that it had not been properly expended. I, of course told them that I could not definitely accept either one or the other proposition, but that 1 would put them forward through you for acceptance; and I hope that Jtis Majesty s Government will ask Messrs. Lynch to decide quickly, and enable me to inform e Khans whether their proposals are agreed to or not. Messrs. Lynch Brothers are not very quick in replying as a rule to communications from the foreign Office on this subject, and during these months it takes at least six weeks to two months to get a reply to a letter.

The Persian Government are no doubt responsible i the matter, and must be held liable for the repayment ^of the sum in question. They do not, however, admit their liability, and it is probable that some delay will occur before the money can be obtained from them. Lord Lansdov/ne considers that it would be undesir able that Lieutenant Colonel Douglas and Mr. Lorimer and their servants should be compelled to await reim bursement during the whole period of the negotiations* His Under Secretary of State, India Office.His Lordship has therefore proposed to the Treasury that the actual losses and expenses incurred, together with the expenses and fees of the American Doctor sent down from Hamadan, should he at once refunded to the parties concerned, pending recovery from the Persian Government^ on the understanding that the advance would he made on hehalf of the Government of India and the Imperial Government, and that in case it should prove impossible to recover the amount from the Persian Gov ernment, one half of the liability will rest with the Indian Exchequer. It will he seen that the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury have agreed to this proposal, and I am to express the hope that Mr. Brodrick will concur in the arrangement.

I am Sir Your most obedient humble Servantf \J copy Confidential ^ * Sir:- X I - / S '• FOREIGN OFFICE, January 9th, 1905. I directed hy the torquess of Lansdowne to transmit to you herewith, to he laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, copies of correspondence respecting a recent attack, by Lur tribesmen, on Lieutenant Colonel Douglas, Military Attach^ to His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran and Mr. Lor liner. His Majesty’s Vice Consul at Ahwaz, while travelling on the public service in South West Per sia. The Incident in question occurred on the Dizful- Khoremabad road, which has been, for some years past, in a very unsafe condition. The Lords Commissioners will observe, from the telegram No.121 of November 2nd and the reports in the despatch No.211 of December 5th from His Majesty's Charge d’Affaires at Tehran, that these officers made an arrangement with the Chiefs of the Direkwand Lurs, who agreed, for a certain sum of money, to act as their p le Secretary to the Treasury.their escort on the road. The party left Khoremahad on October 23rd. When, however, they had proceeded some 30 miles on their journey, the tribesmen began to demand a further sum of money, on the plea that - the original agreement had only applied to Mr. Lori- mer and did not include Lieutenant Colonel Douglas. While negotiations were proceeding a number of men rushed the camp and commenced to carry off various articles. In the struggle,, which ensued, shots were fired and stones thrown by the Lurs, am Lieutenant Colonel Douglas and Mr. Lorimer were both wounded, the former somewhat severely. Eventually the camp was looted and the two officers returned to Khorema- bad with hardly anything except the clothes in which they stood. His Majesty's Charg6 d'Affaires at once ad dressed a verbal representation to the Persian Gov ernment, holding them responsible for the safety of the wounded officers, and demanding the punishment of the guilty tribe and eventual compensation for the losses incurred. Mr. Grant Duff's action was approved and he was instructed to make a further representationrepresentation on behalf of His Majesty^ Government. Copies of the notes exchanged with the Persian Minis ter for Foreign Affairs will be found in his despatch % No.210 of December 5th. It will be seen from this correspondence^ that the Persian Government are reluctant to admit their responsibility in the matter, on the plea that Lieu tenant Colonel Douglas and Mr. Lorimer were warned, before starting on their journey, of the dangers to which they would be exposed. There is, however, no doubt that the Incident is primarily due to the very disturbed condition of that part of Persia, to which the attention of the Persian Government has been re peated!:/ called by His Majesty's Legation. The Per sian Government must, therefore, be held liable not only for the reimbursement of the actual losses and expenses incurred, but also for the payment of suit able compensation to the victims of the outrage. The actual demands to be made by His Majesty's Government in this connection have not yet been fin ally determined. As will be seen from Sir A.Har- dinge's telegram No.153 of December 19th, the lossesand expenses are estimated at £822.14..0. To this rmist he added about £50 for the expenses and fees of the American Missionary Doctor, whom it was arranged to send dov/n from Hamadan to meet the wounded officers, and further expenditure may he entailed by the seri ous nature of Lieutenant Colonel Douglas* wound. Some delay may very probably occur before the sum due is paid over by the Persian Government, who will doubtless follow the usual course of endeavour ing to recover it from the guilty tribe. Lord Lans- downe, however, considers it undesirable that Lieu tenant Colonel Douglas and Mr. Lorimer and their servants snould be compelled to await reimbursement 01 their losses during the whole progress of the negotiations. The necessity of immediate repayment has already arisen in the case of Lieutenant Colonel Douglas* sowar, who has been recalled to India. His Lordship would therefore propose that the actual losses and expenses incurred, together with tne expenses and fees of the American Doctor, should be at once refunded to the parties concerned, pend ing recovery from the Persian Government, and I am toto request that the sanction of the Lords Commission ers may he given to this arrangement. It is understood that the advance would he made on hehalf of the Government of India and the Imperial Government, and that in case it should prove impos sible to recover the amount from the Persian Govern ment, one half of the liahility will rest with the Indian Exchequer.

I AM directed by tbe Marquess of Lansdowne to transmit to you herewith to be laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, copies ot correspondence* respecting a recent attack, by Lur tribesmen, on Lieutenant-Colonel Don Mas Military Attache to His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran, and Mi\ Rorimcr, Ihs Maicsty’s Vice-Consul at Ahwaz, while travelling on the public service in South-\\est Persia. The incident in question occurred on the Dizful-Khorernabad road, w.nch has been, for some years past, in a very unsafe condition. „ lo1 , The Lords Commissioners will observe, from the telegram Ao. ■ 1 ot the -ncl November, and the reports in tbe despatch No. 211 ol the 5tb December, from T is Maiesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran, that these officers made an arrangement with the Chiefs of the Direkwand Lnrs, who agreed, for a certain sum of money, to act as then- escort on the road. The party left Khoremabad on the 23rd October. When, how- ever they had proceeded sor^e 30 miles on their journey, the tribesmen began to demand a further sum of money, on the plea that the original agreement had only applied to Mr Lorimer and did not include Lieutenant-Colonel Douglas. While nego tiations were proceeding, a number of men rushed the camp and commenced to carry off various articles. In the struggle which ensued, shots were fired ami stones tin on n by the Lurs, and Lieutenant-Colonel Douglas and Mr. Lorimer were both wounded, the former somewhat severely. Eventually the camp was looted, and the two officeis returned to Khoremabad with hardly anything except the clothes in which they k 10 His Maiesty’s Charge d’Affaires at once addressed a verbal representation to the Persian Government, holding them responsible for the safety of the wounded and demanding the punishment of the guilty tribe, and eventual compensation foi t losses incurred.

Tehran, December 5, 1904. My Lord, I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith to your Lordship translations of correspondence which has passed between the Mushir-ed-Dowleh and myself in regard to the recent attack by Lur tribesmen on Colonel Douglas and Mr. Lorimer. The Persian Government are making capital, out of the fact that the Beglar Beggi (Mayor) of Khoramabad warned Colonel Douglas that the road was unsafe, and urged him to give up the journey to Dizful; also that the Perman Ferma, who had just taken up the Government of Luristan, telegraphed to Colonel Douglas in the same sense. The Ferman Ferma’s telegram was, however, only received by Colonel Douglas after the attack. The paper given by Colonel Douglas to the Beglar Beggi, to the effect that he did not hold that official personally responsible for the attack, was given subsequent to the occurrence on the return of the party to Khoramabad. I have not as yet been able to obtain the full account of the losses sustained by Colonel Douglas and Mr. Lorimer, but the losses of the lormcr and of the Government servants who accompanied him amount to about 3o,527 krans (about 592/.), so that the total figure will be a considerable one. Your Lordship will see from Dr. M illiams’ Report, which i transmit in a separate despatch, that both Colonel Douglas and Mr. Lorimer have suffered consideiably fiom their wounds. They were wounded on the 26th October, and the doctors only reached them on the afternoon of the 6 th November, fortunately Dr. Williams happened to be passing through Hamadan on his way from Urmi to Kerman shah, and most promptly, and on his own initiative, went to assist the wounded officers. I have already conveyed to Dr. Funk, of the American Presbyterian Mission, your Lordship's thanks for his kindness in giving his services. The Persian Government is certainly responsible for the outrage, which could not have occurred in any country where there is any semblance of good government. ^ I hey will no doubt endeavour to escape paying compensation on the ground that Colonel Douglas was warned not to proceed to Dizful by the local authorities. I venture to express the hope that your Lordship will not admit this excuse, and will allow me to claim not only the amount of the actual losses, but a substantial sum for each of the officers injured, as compensation for the suffering they have endured. i I need not remind your Lordship that since the outrage on Colonel Douglas and Mr. Lorimer His Majesty’s Consul at Urmi has also been attacked. It would be, 1 submit, most unfortunate if the Persian Government were not made responsible for such occurrences. , . . „ Pendin 0 ' the receipt of your Lordship’s instructions as to the claim for compensation to be preferred against the Persian Government, I have thought it better to send no written reply to the Mushir-ed-Dowleh. I have, however, inlormed his Excellency verbally that I have referred the correspondence to His Majesty s Government. J(Signed) EVELYN GRANT DUFF. I have, &amp;c. Inclosure 1 in No. 1.

In reply to the statement made in the note in question, that “the report received by the Persian Government is inaccurate,” &amp;c., I have the honour to state thatjit is clear from the letter addresssd to Mohammed Rahim Khan, the Beglar Beggi of Khoramabad by Mr. Lorimer, that the officers in question were informed before starting that the roads were unsafe, and they were strongly urged not to start, but they refused to acquiesce in the matter. Although copy of the letter in question has already been sent to you by the Meftah-es-Sultaneh, I send it again herewith inclosed that you may carefully read it and fully acquaint yourself with the circum stances. . It is quite true that the letter in question had been written after the incident, but it explains that the officers had been told when they were starting that the road is unsafe, and they went and met with the incident on account of the imaginary confidence they had. I have no doubt, that when you carefully read the inclosure you will agree that no responsibility whatever rests with the Persian Government in the matter, and that the incident has'been due to their own carelessness. Inclosure 5 in No. 1. Ferman Ferma to Mushir-ed-Dowleh. (Translation.) (Telegraphic.) 27 Shaaban, 1322 (November 6, 1934). I HAVE received vour Excellenc 3 r ’s telegram respecting the statements made by the British Legation concerning Colonel Douglas and Mr. Lorimer, and their encounter with the unruly Lurs. I had no information of this incident, and the Buiujiid line has been interrupted for the last feiv days (October 30), and I had received no news; but a few days ago, since Burujird and Luristan were added to the Government of Kermanshah, I askedTfor a telegraphic report. In the telegraphic report I received from Burujird it was stated that on that day a caravan was starting foi Khoramabad, and the British Charge d’Affaires* had left. As I was aware of tlie unsettled state of Luristan, and no Deputy Governor had yet arrived there, and not a single officer had been sent to make arrangements there, I became very anxious for the Englishmen. ^ I at once telegraphed in the following sense to Burujird, and at the same time Nasrullah Khan was to forward this telegram to its destination by road guards . A “ To the British Charge d’Affaires. v ' . “ To-day the 10th (20th) October I saw in the reports that your Excellency is proceeding from Burujird towards Luristan. While you are well aware of the present unsettled state of Luristan and the tribes, 1 do not know what necessity there is foi ,&gt;our Excellency’s journey at this time. As the government of that district has been added to my government only a few day's ago, and the desirable airangements have not yet been made with regard to its security, I make a friendly request that you should remain at Khoramabad until the necessary arrangements have been made and security assured Your Excellency’s journey from Khoramabad to any place y'ou may wish to go will have been facilitated. If your desire is to visit Luristan, I request you to return to Burujird and to remain there until i go myself to those districts, when I will make perfect arrangements for your Excellency’s visit. Otherwise, as you are aware of the unsettled state of affairs in Luristan, I do not consider it advisable ^ “ Ferman Ferma.” Addressed to the British Charge d’Affaires, the above was communicated to that oentleman, and I also telegraphed to Mohammed Bagher Khan, the officer in charge of the Cossacks at Burujird, ordering him to send ten Cossacks to this gentleman, who is * This, of course, refers to Colonel Douglas.. . , jcither British Charge d’affaires, or whoever he may be, and to ask him to return to Burujird until facilities for his journey have been made. Besides this, I tele'-raphed to the Sadr Azam, saying that as there is no Deputy Governor for Luristan and Burujird and no arrangements have been made for those districts, the journey of this gentleman without my knowledge and without my having made facilities for his journey appears to Tne incomprehensible, and I do not hold myself responsible. With regard to the punishment of the offenders, though it is certain that I will do my best to punish them, and I consider this to be my duty, the offenders are the unruly oegn ends, and their condition is known to the Persian authorities, and the measures .aken by them aie clearer than I could explain, and they have never been punished because they inhabit the summits of the mountains and thick woods impossible for 'uns' and horsemen. They are just as savage as the blacks in Africa, and perhaps even much more so His Royal Highness the Sadr Azam and the Sepahsalar are well informed of the condition of the Lur tribes, and what I may say on this point is superfluous. 1 ivn 1 ^ aS / m i? hin ? this tele S ram when I recived a letter from Mohammed Rahim Kban, iieglar Beggi of Khoramabad, saying that a few days ago the British Charge ft Affaires, Mr. Lorimer, was leaving Khoramabad for Dizful, and in view of the unsettled state of the Luristan tribe and the insecurity of the roads, he tried to pre\ent him from doing so, but he replied that they were acquainted with the Direkvend Lurs, and had confidence in them, and gave a written document which he has sent to me and which runs as follows :— When we left for Arabistan Mirza Rahim Khan, the Bagler Beggi, told us that for the present it is not permissible that we should start for Arabistan, and you cannot place confidence in the Direkvend Lurs. Do not start now. In view of the con fidence and trust reposed by Mr. Lorimer, the Vice-Consul of Arabistan, himself in the Direkvend Chiefs who brought him from Arabistan, a start was made, and I left, and this event having occurred no blame can on this account attach to the local authorities.” Dated 17th Shaaban (October 27). With regard to the restoration of the property of these gentlemen, and the punish ment of the offenders, the Sadr.'Azam, who is well acquainted with the Direkvends knows better.

Mr. Grant Duff to the Marquess of Lansdoivne. — (Received December 26.) (No. 211.) My Lord Tehran, December 5, 3904. ' WITH reference to my immediately preceding despatch, I have the lionour to transmit herewith reports which I have received from Colonel Douglas on the subject of the attack made on him and Mr. Lorimer by Lurs between Khoremabad and Dizful. I have already had the honour to inform your Lordship of the principal details of the occurrence in my telegram No. 127 of the 10th of November last. I have, with your Lordship’s approval, given instructions to Lieutenant V\ ilhams. His Majesty’s Acting Consul at Kermanshah, to accompany the Herman Fermah to Khoremabad in order that he may watch and report on the action taken by the Persian authorities to restore order in Luristan and punish the persons guilty of the outrage on our officers. As your Lordship will perceive, Colonel Douglas is by no means sanguine as to the result of such action, and recommends that His Majesty’s Government should themselves undertake the pacification ol Luristan. i i i i I am disposed to agree with Colonel Douglas that any expedition undertaken by tne Persian Government against the Lurs will not be attended with satisfactory results, but the employment of a British force in the interior of Persia would raise difficult questions and mio-ht bring about a state of affairs which His Majesty’s Government would probably wish toavoid or at least to defer as long as possible. The settlement of Luristan is, however, a question which will sooner or later have to be decided by some one, and the Persian Government, at no recent time powerful, shows distinct signs of deteriorating from year to year If the Karun irrigation scheme is taken up by His Majesty’s Govern ment and proves a successrthe peaceful condition of South-western Persia will become a matter of o-reat immediate importance. It should not, I venture to think, be lost sight of that the attack on Colonel Douglas and Mr. Lorimer, and the probable incapacity of the Persian Government to obtain redress from the Lur tribes, affords an^opportunity for interference on the part of His Majesty’s Government which may not easily occur I have, &amp;c. (Signed) E\ EL 4 N GRANT DUPE. Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel Douglas to Mr. Grant Duff. Burujird, November 8, 1904. I HAVE the honour to make the following preliminary report on the incident which occurred to Mr. Lorimer and myself between Khoremabad and Diztul, of which you have already been informed by telegraph. , , . . t On my arrival at Burujird on the 14th October I found that news had just been receive! there that Muzaffer-ul-Mulk had been dismissed from the Governorsnip, which had been handed over to his Highness the Ferman Fermah. As no representative had been apnointed by the latter, there was practically no Government in the province and no responsible person to whom I could apply for an escort on to Khoremabaa. After waiting three days in Burujird, I finally left in company with a Persian merchant from Khoremabad who is constantly on the road and was able to make the necessaiy arrangements for escorts with the local tribes. Immediately after leaving Burtijird I met Mr Lorimer, who had come up from Dizuil to Khoremabad to meet me and nm, finding me there was on his way to Burujird, and we travelled thence together. Mr Lorimer had come from Dizful in company with the Chiefs of the Dnekvend tule, who had there made an agreement with him, and had solemnly sworn on the Koran tnat they would bring him up by the Kialan route, and would take us both oack for the sum of 100 tomans which he had paid them. I was particularly anxious to see this, the [2280 cc—21]2 fi re u’| r0Ute ’ ant J dec , i , ded J th . ereforc ’ to avail myself of the opportunity of doin- so '0'l, d he r e say that Mr. Lorimer had had some slight trouble on the way uo which had shnSlar* 1 }l ar,n S to pay another 30 tomans, and he warned me that^her’e might be similai difficulties on the way down, but we did not anticipate any trouble beyond peihaps attempts to extract further sums of money from us. We accordingly ao-ain o-ot into communication with these Direkvend Chiefs, who expressed their wiilimmess^to ,Z r -l? Ut the , ''mamder ot their agreement, and accordingly on the 23rd October we lejt Khoremabad in their company. On the evening of the 25th October, when about -L 1111 ° s oni Wmremaiiad, they came and demanded from me a further sum of for -WTO 8 ' &gt; ‘- a G C ° ndUCt i’ Plea tl,at the original agreement had only been 'TT y ’ T! ad n0t 1 . ncludetl m &gt; se,f - 1 had not this sum with me am. told them that I could not pay it, and by nightfall the negotiations had made the ndeft 'on pr0gress ' f J 16 follo ' ln S morning we did not march, and a deputation of \ftor * , ” V T, t&lt;&gt; c , an “P&gt; and ' ve Wain proceeded to talk the nlatter over Aftei some hours talking, 1 had agreed to pay them 200 tomans, which was all I had the dhffie‘'it d * ' eJ lad cx l ) ' essed ‘heir willingness to accept this sum, and I thouMit that , ' ' as smoothed over, for the time being at any rate. At this moment a number ot men rushed into our camp and commenced to carry off various articles anion'.- others my rifle, which was inside mytent. unities, among It is difficult to describe the events of the next few moments.

At the same moment as I emerged from my tent 1 was struck in the right forearm by a bullet which rendered me powerless. The Lurs then proceeded to rifle everything, and shortly afterwards turned us out of the camp, telling ns we could go back to” Khoremabad They gave us three baggage pomes, and allowed us and the servants to take away a about v* 6 ]’ b *£ kept ° Ur h ° rses ’ mu,es ’ an d everything we possessed. We returned about 1_ miles that evening to a place called Chimashk. and the following day the •-'0th made our way into Khoremabad, where we were taken in and looked after bi-Mirza AH - -bci, the same merchant who had helped me on my way through from Burujird. iv 'Vk * le e ; xtr 1 eme y , &lt; I Isturhe&lt;i state of the country it was impossible for us to move &lt;&gt;m khoremabad, and out of four messengers f tried to send through with news to Burujird only one succeeded m making Ins way. Finally, on the 4th' November chiefly mung to the exertions of Mirza Ali Akber, we were able to commence our journey to Burujird, where we arrived safely on the 6th, where we found Dr. Funk' fron/the American Mission at Hamadan, and Lieutenant Williams, I.M.S., who had just arrived f om Hamadan, to meet us. Lieutenant Lorimer is suffering from fracture of the left hamr 3 l 1 laly ^ ne ’ Im P' lcatln S hls supra-orbital nerve, and a gunshot wound of the Jett hand 1 myself am suffering from a severe gunshot wound of the lower part of the right forearm and compound fracture of the radius and ulna. I he matter has, of course, been reported to the local Persian authorities, but it is under the present circumstances, hopeless to expect any action on their part. While we were at Khoremabad it was only with the greatest difficulty that the one reriment in the district was able to make its way in from Alishtar, where they had been durum- : the summer, and they are now afraid to venture more than a few miles from the walls I - Ih ® Government is openly defied by the tribes, and is powerless to take any action against them H.s Highness the Ferman Forma has telegraphed to me that c has sent oiders tor the punishment ot the offenders, but I have no hope that even an attempt to do so will be made at present.

I have, &amp;c, (Signed) J. A. DOUGLAS, Military Attache. mules belonging- to Persian owners, 1 will send a detailed statement onInclosure 2 in No. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel Douglas to Mr. Grant Duff. Sir, Ramadan, November 14, 1901. IN my despatch of the 8th instant I related briefly the incidents of my journey in Luristan, hut in order to understand the matter more clearly it is necessary that I should give a short account of the present condition of affairs in that country. The country between Dizful and Khoremabad is occupied by a number of small tribes, whose relations to each other are constantly changing, and who move from one part ol* the country to the other according to the season of the year. At present the country immediately to the north of Dizful is occupied by a section of the Sagvend tribe under a Chief named Khanjan Khan; further still to the north along the line of the direct road from Dizful to Khoremabad the country is occupied by the Direkvends, a large tribe who move only within narrow limits, keeping to the high ground in the summer and the lower hills in the winter, hut never descending into the plains of Arabistan. This tribe have no recognized head, but they have Avhat may he termed a ruling section known as the Mirs; these Mirs are all said to be descendants of a former Chief of the tribe, and arc now so numerous as to form a separate section of their own, and though they cannot be said to exercise any authority over the other sections of the tribe, they have, perhaps, a certain amount of influence with them. The Direkvends, from the central position which they occupy, are able to raid their neighbours in every direction, and in consequence are usually at feud with the other tribes, but latterly they have been on fairly good terms with the section of the Sagvends of which Khanjan Khan is Chief. From the position which they occupy it is evident that they are a very important factor in any scheme which has for its object the opening up of the direct road from Dizful to Khoremabad. In order to inaugurate the policy indicated by Sir A. Hardinge in his despatch No. 122, dated the 1st July last, it was absolutely necess a ry to enter into d jyect xela,tiij.ns^ with these tribes, and without any reference to the Persian Government, and with this obj&amp;cfe 4 ii vfffTG Mr. Lorimer first got into communication with Khanjan Khan, who showed himself to be very friendly, and permitted that officer to accompany his section of the Sagvends on their annual migration to the higher ground in the neighbourhood of Khoremabad in the spring of this year. On his return journey from Khoremabad Mr. Lorimer went by a somewhat circuitous route further to the west; the northern portion of this country is occupied by the Delfans, a large tribe whose Chief holds the title of Fath-i-Sultan, ana who appears to have the men of his tribe well under control. He, too, was very friendly, and escorted Mr. Lorimer as far as the Saimarra River, where his territory adjoins that of the Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh, with whom he is at present on bad terms ; thence Mr. Lorimer made his way southwards through country occupied by various small tribes, none ot whom displayed any hostility, and so returned to Dizful. A short time later intertribal feuds forced Khanjan Khan and his tribe to return to the neighbourhood of Dizful, so that Mr. Lorimer was still able to keep in com munication with him. Through him he w r as able to sound the Direkvends and other tribes on the subject of supplying men to guard the Dizful-Khoremabad road, with the results already reported by him. Up to this time, however, he had never been brought into direct relation with the Direkvend tribe. When the idea of visiting Luristan this autumn first occurred to me, I wrote to Mr. Lorimer asking whether he could make any arrangements with the tribes to enable me to go through from Khoremabad to Dizful, if possible by the direct or Kialan route, or, if that were out of the question, by some more circuitous road. Owing to the difficulty of communication, 1 had received no definite answer up to the time of my leaving Tehran; but on my arrival at Burujird I received a letter from him telling me that he was on his way to Khoremabad to meet me. As I have stated in my former despatch, he had, with the assistance of Khanjan Khan, made an agreement with the Mirs of the Direkvends by which they undertook to see him through to Khoremabad, mid to escort myself and him from the latter place back to Dizful. When Mr. Lorimer told me of this agreement I did not nesitatc to accept the opportunity ot seeing the direct road, which is the route which was toimcily itgulaily used by the caravans, and by which the journey from Diztul to Khoremabad can be- performed in six or eight days. There was no reason to believe that the Mirs would fail to carry out the engagement they had made, far less to anticipate that the} would be guilty of such a breach of faith as they subsequently committed.4 1 he incident which lias occurred cannot, I fear, fail to have a damaging effect on our prestige in this part ot Luristan, unless the Direkvends are punished in such a manner as will be not only a lesson to them, but also a deterrent to others; but how this punish ment is to be inflicted it is difficult to say. At present I hear of regiments beino- collected for the reduction of Luristan to order this winter; but I have little hesitation m saying that no force which the Persians are likely to collect will venture on offensive operations against the Lur tribes; and, should they do so, they will probably meet with disaster. Possibly by playing upon the intertribal jealousies the Persian Government nngnt be able to bring some pressure on the Direkvends, but it is impossible that thev could m this manner inflict any punishment that would have a lasting effect. Both from a commercial and political point of view, it is important to us to open up the Dizful- \ Iioremahad road ; and until these tribes have received adequate punishment it is l believe, impossible for us to do so. Such punishment should include the surrender of tee principal men implicated, as well as a heavy fine on the tribe, which should preterably take the form of the surrender of a large number of rifles—terms which 1 believe, the Persian Government are powerless to enforce. The only practical solution ot the question would, I believe, be tor us to press the Persian Government to inflict such punishment; and should they show' themselves either unable or unwillino* to do so for us to send troops ourselves to co-operate with them in much the same manner as was done in the case of the murder of Mr. Graves in Persian Baluchistan. It would not I believe require a large force. AJuagade of all arms wou ld probably be sufficient, and there is no doubt that the effect would be excellent, and that once we had shown our ability if necessary, to enforce our demands, we should have no difficulty afterwards in opening up the road and introducing any system of road-guards which might be considered advisable Unless something of the sort is done, the whole scheme must necessarily be dropped tor the present, so tar. at least, as this part of Luristan is concerned i append the names of some of the Mirs who were with Mr. Lorimer and myself at the time the outrage was committed. 1 .

I HA\ E the honour to inclose herewith a copj^ of the Instructions which I have sent to Mr. Williams, His Majesty’s Acting Consul at Kermanshah, in regard to the attitude he is to adopt when he proceeds to Luristan, in order to watch the steps taken by the Persian Government to punish the persons guilty of the recent attack on Colonel Douglas and Mr. Lorimer. The Grand Vizier recently informed me that troops were to be sent from here, and that about 600 men had already left Kermanshah for Luristan. It remains to be seen whether the action of the Persian Government will lead to a satisfactory result. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) EVELYN GRANT DUER Inclosure in No. 1. Mr. Grant Duff to Acting Consul Williams. Sir, Tehran, November 29, 1904. IN view of the recent attack by the Direkwend Lurs on Colonel Douglas, Military Attache of His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran, and Mr. Lorimer, His Majesty’s Vice-Consul for Arabistan, it has become necessary to depute a British Consular officer to proceed to Lu ristan to see that efficient steps are taken by the Persian authorities to punish the tribe referred to. I am informed by the Mushir-ed-Dowleh that the Ferman Ferma will shortly proceed to Luristan with the object of restoring order in that province, and of punishing the persons who attacked and wounded Colonel Douglas and Mr. Lorimer. On receipt of this despatch you should inform the Ferman Kerma that you have received instructions to accompany his Highness to Luristan with your escort. When in Luristan you should confine yourself to watching and reporting on the action of the Persian authorities, and to offering your advice, should you think this necessary. On no account should you or your escort take part in any punitive expedition or measures, and you should, as far as possible, use your influence to prevent unjust or cruel reprisals. As you are doubtless aware, the Persian authorities are quite capable in these cases, in order to save themselves trouble or to extort money, of inflicting punishment on innocent people. You will, of course, do your utmost to prevent unnecessary delay on the part of the local authorities. 1 request you to inform the Ferman Ferma that I received, and thank him for the message he sent me through Mr. Rabino, and that I note that, while repudiating all responsibility for the outrage on Colonel Douglas and Mr. Lorimer, he expresses his intention of bringing to justice the persons guilty of the outrage. You should state that His Majesty’s Government holds the Persian Government responsible for the attack on our officers, and express my hope that he will at an early date put an end to the anarchy prevailing in the province with the government of which he has lately been invested. You are entitled, while absent from Kermanshah on Government Service, to a sub sistence allowance of 1/. a-day over and above your pay and in addition to your journey expenses. You should draw on His Majesty’s Legation for such advances as you require, and you should furnish me with a detailed account of all money disbursed on Government Service. I have, &amp;c.

If outrage is the work of a stray gang, it will be necessary to watch closely the punitive measures which Persian Government may take, lest the good relations which have been established by Lorimer with leading Chiefs of Luristan be embittered as result of indiscriminate reprisals. We would suggest that it may be well not to lose the opportunity for pressing Persian Government to consent to the institution of a Persian force, under the command of British officers, similar to the Cossack Brigade of the Russians. We would invite reference to despatch, dated 14M August 1896, from Sir M. Durand, in which a similar suggestion was made in connection with the assault on Tanfield. Precedent for securing substantial concessions in consequence of outrage upon a British official in China is afforded by the Chifu Convention. In 1898, also, when Graves was murdered, Indian troops were despatched to Charbar and Jask, and these troops still remain in Persian territory.

COPY 7 OF TELEGRAM FROM Dated Received at London Office[This Document is the Property of Her Britannic Majesty’s Government.] ASIA. [September 7.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 2. 2499 No. 1. Sir M. Durand to the Marquess of Salisbury.—{Received September 7.) I HA\ E the honour to submit the following report upon the present condition of affairs in Persia. In the north of Persia the state of affairs since the new Shah’s arrival in Tehran has from our point of view continued to be fairly satisfactory. There has been, and is, some anxiety about the behaviour of the Kurds on the noith-v\est fiontiei, but hitherto no anti-Christian outbreaks have occurred among the Persian Kurds, and I hope that the prevailing excitement may pass away without trouble. Elsewhere in the north all has been quiet, and the Shah, though somewhat weak and timid, has done passably well. He has paid up the whole of his unsecured debt to the Imperial Bank, and has made some arrangements for the coinage of silver, and for the gradual calling in of the excessive copper currency which has caused so much distress. He does not appear to be under Russian influence to the extent that was predicted bv some who knew him. He has, for example, resisted all attempts to dislodge his English doctor, who has now been formally installed as chief physician to the Shah on a salary of 7,000 tomans a-year (I,4i00/.). He has most resolutely insisted upon appointing as Valiahd, his eldest son, now at labriz, instead of the second son, who had the support of the Russians, and was generally expected to succeed. This incident has done some thing to strengthen British influence in the country, for it is generally believed that we pressed the claims of the eldest son. The belief is shared by the new Valiahd himself, and we are on very friendly terms with him and his mother. This lady, though she insisted some years ago upon being divorced from the Shah, and has since married again, still retains much influence over His Majesty, and carries considerable weight in Tehran! Finally the Shah has nominated to a minor Governorship, the Ain-ed-Dowleh, who was leader of the Russian jmrty in Tabriz, and had come here with the full intention of supplanting the Sadr-i-Azam. His great rival, the Farman-Farma, our most open and fearless adherent in Persia, has been appointed Governor of Tehran, with the command of six regiments. It is somewhat characteristic, both of the Shah and the Farman- Farma, that the latter w r as forbidden to come to Tehran, lest there should be trouble between him and the Ain-ed-Dowleh, and that he replied by throwing up the Kerman Governorship, and starting at once for the capital, where, so far, he has carried all before him. This state of affairs is promising from our point of view, but unfortunately the state of affairs in the south of Persia is very much less satisfactory. In the province of Fars, which has been scandalously misruled by the late Shah’s brother, the Rukn- ud-Dowleh, there has been considerable disorder. Large quantities of British goods have been plundered, and several Englishmen have been more or less seriously maltreated. One, an Assistant Surgeon in the Telegraph Department, was deliberately waylaid and wounded by a musket shot. Another, a Telegraph Inspector, was stripped of all his clothing and severely beaten. In neither case has anything been done to punish the offenders, though they are known. The Rukn-ud-Dowleh has now been removed, after many complaints from this Legation and from the people of Shiraz, but a great deal of harm has been done. On the Karun the state of affairs is even worse. I have at last induced the Persian Government to insist upon the payment of com pensation for the Malamir affray, which occurred several months ago, but the soldiers who assaulted our people have been allowed to abscond practically without any punish ment, and the Persian Government now inform me plainly that they dare not do any. thing at Shuster, where the mob is a very bad one, and where they have no troops whom they can trust. In consequence, I fear, of the inactivity of the local authorities in this [ 1512 c—2]2 case, there has been another attack upon an Englishman, Mr. Tanfield, of Lynch and Co., who has been dreadfully wounded and disfigured. I have the honour to inclose copies of certain papers bearing on this case:— Copy of a Report from Messrs. Lynch.* Copy of Mr. Tanfield’s statement. Copy of Dr. Scott’s certificate.* I have tried in vain to get the would-be murderer punished. He has been carried off—nommaHy in chains for punishment in Tehran—and nothing whatever has been done in “buster, where the mob hooted and stoned Mr. Tanfield as he was carried down wounded to the river. Not only have the local authorities taken no notice of this brutal demonstration but when Captain Sykes arrived to inquire into the matter the Governor treated him with marked discourtesy, and refused to return his call. Mr Sykes is of opinion that an Englishman’s life is no longer safe in Shuster, and ssrs. Lynch and Co. have decided not to send an assistant to replace Mr. Tanfield. am very reluctant to make any proposals which might be inconvenient to your Lordship, and, when everything is going so well for us in Tehran, I am very reluctant to advocate measures which will be unpalatable to the Persian Government. But our merchants and officials have evidently some reason to urge that the state of affairs described above is such as we ought not to tolerate, and that it is incumbent upon us to insist both upon some reparation for the way we have been treated and upon the future™ 0 ' ^ SUCh arrangements as wiU guarantee the safety of our people for the and Imstflitv t'n the natural centre for our trade, and it is just there that fanaticism and hostility to LngJishmen have been most conspicuously shown. , the l5u ' h ‘ re roa &lt;l order and security will, I think, be restored before long, but I see no chance of this on the Karun under present conditions. I am therefore telegraphing to your Lordship suggesting that Her Majesty’s Goveinment shoidd authorize me to demand the payment of a large indemnity to j al *ueld, the execution of his assailant in Tehran or elsewhere, and an ample apology to be made by the Governor in person to Captain Sykes, at Shuster, for all the misconduct of the Shuster people and the local authorities. I think that these demands if made, should be pressed upon the Persian Government in such a manner as to insure their being accepted. [ l ia J e K n n S i Ugg f send j?S ^ he “ Lawrence ” and “ Sphinx ” to Muhammera, as advocated by Colonel M ilson, Her Majesty’s Consul-General in Ears, because the heat in tne Upper Gulf is at this season too great to be faced without urgent necessity, and also because . hope that the Persian Government will not force us to enter upon a naval demonstration for the enforcement of our terms, but such a demonstration may become necessary hereafter. J If the Persian Government accept our demands and carry them out the present incident may be regarded as closed, but there will remain the‘question of our future position on the Karun. At present our merchants naturally consider that an Englishman s life is not safe at Shuster, and Captain Sykes reports that the Persian Government is really powerless to execute at that place the murderer of an Englishman. I he only way, so xar as I can see, to establish security for the future, and let our trade develop from this natural centre, is to appoint a resident Vice-Consul under the protection of a trustworthy armed force. That force might take the form of an escort of Indian troops, but it would, in my opinion, be much better on all accounts to raise at the expense of the Persian Government a body of Bakhtiaris and Arabs under British officers. It will be remembered that the Russians have an armed force under Russian officers in Tehran itself. They could not logically object to our having a similar force m the south, and the I ersian Government if resolutely pressed would, I believe agree. They fully understand how hopeless they are against coercion from the side of Muhammera where the powerful Sheikh Mizal, who controls the Karun up to Ahwaz only awaits a signal from us to throw off his allegiance to the Shah. They are also, 1 think, beginning to understand that if they declare their inability to protect Englishmen from murderous attacks they must expect unpleasant consequences. L Moreover, the consequences would not be wholly unpleasant to them. The Persian Government would not like paying for the corps, and they would not like the trouble of overcoming possible Russian opposition; but, on the other hand, they could make some reduction in their existing force, and they know that a body of trustworthy troops under British officers would give the Central Government a firm hold on the province where it * Already received.3 was quartered. Nothing is more surprising than the small number of armed men required to dominate a Persian town or district. A force equivalent to a single regiment would, I believe, amply suffice for Shuster and the neighbourhood—say 400 or .500 infantry, tw r o squadrons of cavalry, and a couple of guns. ^ 3 ^ rCe w ? u ¥ ^ urt ^ er be a nucleus for the extension of our influence amon# the Lakhtians and Arabs. Our ^ officers would soon get some knowledge of the surrounding tribes from which their recruits would be drawn, and if we ever desired to ^ extend the system the foundation would have been laid. A similar corps could at any time be raised in Ispahan, where the Zil-es-Sultan would, I feel sure, be delighted to see it. I fully realize the objections to this proposal, and I have not put it forward without long and serious consideration. It means pressure brought to bear upon the Persian Government a time when in many w r ays we are getting on very well with them; it also means some trouble hereafter in securing regular payments; it probably means some expense to ourselves: and it may mean that we shall alarm Eussia and provoke her to some vigorous countermove. She is at present believed to be seriously con- templating the establishment of Consulates in Ispahan and Shiraz and Bushire, and anv such step as I have proposed might accelerate her movements. Nevertheless, from the point of view of this Legation, I think that we should gain more by it than we could lose. It would be by no means an unmixed evil if we were to show the Persian Govern ment that there are some limits to our forbearance, which they are inclined to doubt. The expense to ourselves would at the worst be inconsiderable. And though I think our proper course with regard to the Eussians in Persia is to avoid all sensational and provocative measures, 1 believe this measure could be carried out without grave con sequences, more especially as there is some talk of augmenting the numbers of the Cossack Brigade in Tehran. I would not, however, advocate that we should insist at all hazards upon raising such a force as I have suggested. I should like to see it raised, for I believe nothing else would so effectually strengthen our influence in the south of Persia; but if the Persians agreed in preference to the establishment of a considerable Indian escort in Shuster, or if they made prompt and effective arrangements on their own account for the dispatch to Shuster of thoroughly trustworthy troops from elsewhere, then we might suspend the proposal. In fact, while trying to secure our object, I think we might avoid presenting a formal demand. 1 P' hat we really want in the first place is to secure the safety of our traders and their property, and possibly we may find that this can be secured without raising a force under British officers. If so, perhaps we need not press for anything more. I should be glad to be favoured with an expression of your Lordship’s views upon this proposal. I can imagine that it may at first sight seem a somewhat dangerous one, but the present state of Shuster is exceedingly bad, and if our trade is to be developed something must be done to maintain order and security there for the future. As to the troubles on the Shiraz road, I presume I am right in insisting upon the right of our traders to receive from the Persian Government either the goods which have been stolen, with compensation for any damage done, or the full value of those goods. The Persian Government practically admit that they are bound' by this principle. T linvp (Signed) ’ H. M. DUEANP. Inclosure in No. 1 . Statement of Mr. Tanfield. AT the time I came down to Bussorah, last August, with the small-pox, while on the “ Malamir,” off Muhammera, I put my watch and chain under my pillow. It was stolen during the night. I suspected Saduk, my butler, and when I got back to Shuster I discharged him. About two months later I took him back into my service, not being able to get another servant at Shuster. When Mr. Eichards left for London I went to Ahwaz and took over charge. After making up my cash account at the end of the month following that in which I took over charge, I found it over 1,018 krans short. I asked Saduk whether any one had been about the office while the money was out of the safe. He replied, nobody except himself. About the same time I also missed 12 rupees and 2 krans of my private money. I taxed him with having stolen the missing money.and he declared that he had not seen it, Just afterwards the Shah’s death occurred, and a few days later I proceeded to Shuster, intending to go on to Dizful. When at Shuster Saduk came to me and said that his brother had arrived from Ispahan and wished to enter my service as syce. As I had just discharged my two syces I engaged him, and sent him to Ahwaz, where my horses were. Saduk asked me for SO krans on account of his own and of his brother’s salary—an advance—as he said that neither of them had any money. We (Saduk and I) left for Dizful. Saduk, who accompanied my caravan, reported on reaching Dizful that he had been stopped on the road and had been forced to pay 50 krans. Domio, my cook, denies the truth of this statement, but says that Saduk told him he had 50 krans stolen from him. When at Dizful, one evening I found my only remaining two-and-a-half bottles of whisky missing. I dined with Agha Ali the same evening, and on my return to my house I found Saduk all of a heap on a shalif of wool. I tried to awaken him, but was unsuccessful. I found that my bed was not ready upstairs, and I eventually made my bed with the assistance of my clerk. The next morning Saduk came to me and said, “ Your watch, together with 50 krans of mine were stolen last night.” I replied that I did not believe it, and added, “ I believe’ you have either stolen them yourself, or lost them when drunk.” JS^o more was said about it until we arrived at Shuster, when, on the 17 th, he asked me to make up his account, and whatever he owed me for the watch he was willing to pay me. I would mention that previous to this, and after my return from Dizful, I had a quiet talk with my clerk. The clerk told me that he was keeping Saduk’s accounts, and that he (the clerk) had GOO krans belonging to Saduk, and also 300 krans in bonds. Saduk had paid him (the clerk) 600 krans immediately after his arrival from Ahwaz. We made up his (Saduk’s) account, and it was found that he owed me 110 krans taking his and his brother’s salary to the end of June and charging him with 85 krans for the cost of the watch (the 1,000 krans which he was suspected of stealing at Ahwaz were not included in this account). This 110 krans balance due to me he drew from the clerk Yusuf, and paid me, lemarking to the clerk at the time that he would make jVlulla Mdihomed, Lynch’s agent at Dizful, swear that he or his people knew nothing about the robbery, and if he could not get the money out of Mulla Mahomed he knew how to get it. When I heard this I decided to discharge him the next day. About 9 o’clock that night, although there were two koojahs full of water on the roof, he came up and put another one there and went down again. I noticed this and thought nothing of it. Between me and Yusuf the clerk—we both were sleeping on the roof—there is an empty bed. I went to bed iibout 9. About 10 I found myself out of the bed on the ground and stunned. I saw Saduk lifting up a sword to strike me on the head, and I immediately put up my left hand to save my head. The blow descended and severed the left hand, inflicting a wound on my head. He then made repeated cuts elsewhere and I became unconscious. I knew nothing more until I came to my senses in Yusuf’s arms. While I was being carried from the house to the river bank at Shuster a large crowd of people followed us rejoicing that I had been killed, stone-throwing also began, and a stone passed close to the bed on which I wap being carried. When 1 was put on the raft they lined the Shuster bank of the river and continued shouting abuse and throwing stones. Four ferrashes were sent by the Nizam to carry me to the river, but their presence did not appear to have any effect on the crowd. Declared before me: (Signed) J. F.
