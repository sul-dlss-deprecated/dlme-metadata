Introduction. The object of this pamphlet is to enable those who make use of the Indian Stores Department, to understand its organization and scope and to obtain their requirements of stores with the minimum of labour and delay. I.— Organization and Functions of the Department. Headquarters Organization 1. A diagram showing the organization of the Department is appended. The Headquarters’ office is located at Simla, from April to October, and at the Imperial Secretariat, New Delhi, from November to March. “ Storind, Simla/New Delhi, ” has been registered as its telegraphic address. It comprises, besides a central organization for direction, (1) the Purchase and Intelligence Direc torate ; and (2) the Inspection Directorate. 2. The Direction Branch deals with questions relating to estab- Direction lishment, and is in administrative control of the entire work of Branch, the Department including the Purchase and Inspection of stores. 3. Under the Purchase and Intelligence Directorate there are two purchase and main branches : (i) Purchase and (ii) Intelligence. Intelligence w v / b . Directorate. 4. The Purchase Branch comprises three sections:— Puvchist (A) Engineering, (dealing with Plant and Machinery, Electri- Branch, cal and Water Supply Stores); (B) Hardware, (dealing with Metals, Railway Stores, Oils and Paints, Hardware and miscellaneous stores), and (C) Textiles, (dealing with Textiles, leather and allied stores). The officers in charge of these sections and their assistants are men with a practical commercial knowledge of the stores dealt with. 5. The function of the purchase branch is to receive indents and to arrange for compliance with them by placing contracts with supplying firms. Orders are placed in accordance with the “ Rules for the supply of articles required to be purchased for the Public Service.” 6. The Indian Stores Department holds no stocks of stores of any kind. On receipt of an indent supply is arranged in one of two ways—either by placing a separate order for the stores demand ed or by combining the demand with others for compliance under a general contract, or where convenient, under a “ running ” or “ rate ” contract. 7. A “ running ” contract is a contract for the supply of an approximate quantity of the stores detailed in the schedule annexed thereto at a fixed price during a certain period. M66ISD2 The approximate requirements of a number of indentors for the period in question are combined, and the contract prpvides that any of these indentors may demand their requirements at any time dur ing the period of the contract either direct from the firm or by indent on the Indian Stores Department. Demands against these contracts are carefully watched by Headquarters and the contracts usually provide for an increase or decrease of the approximate quantity specified in the schedule at the option of the Buyer on his giving due notice, and if at any time during the currency of the contract it appears probable that that quantity is likely to prove a considerable under or over estimate adjustments are made as necessary. One great advantage of this type of contract is that it enable 8 the small indentor to obtain the advantage of prices quoted for large quantities. For instance, a contract is entered into for the approximate requirements of the Army of khaki drill for one year, which may amount to one million yards. Any indentor requiring drill to the same specification, however small the quantity, can obtain his requirements at the contract price. 8. A “ rate ” contract is a contract for the supply of the stores detailed in the schedule attached thereto, at fixed rates during the period covered by the contract. No quantities are men tioned in the contract and the contractor is bound to accept any order which may be placed on him by the Indian Stores Department at the rates specified. Favourable quotations are usually obtained for this type of contract because the contractor is assured of regular demands. It has the further advantage to the indentor of enabling him to obtain his stores without the delay involved by calling for tenders for each demand. A list of the “ Rate ” and “ Running ” Contracts in force will be furnished on application. 9. Orders are, as a rule, placed against carefully prepared speci fications or against sealed samples. Kxcept in cases where the indentor specifically stipulates that inspection by the Indian Stores Department is not required, all stores purchased are inspected before despatch by the technical inspectors of the Department, which en sures that the stores tendered are exactly in accordance with the specification or sample against which the order was placed if such there be. 10. Orders are placed, as far as possible, only with firms borne on the list of “ Approved Contractors ” to the Indian Stores Depart ment, and the greatest care is taken to ensure that no firm is regis tered on this list unless its reliability has been fully established. The list is overhauled periodically and the names of contractors who have failed to give satisfactory service are removed from it. *Ordinarily all orders, the cost of which is estimated to amount to Rs. 5,000 or over, are advertized in the Indian Trade Journal, Calcutta, which is the standard medium for advertizing the require ments of this Department, If considered desirable, advertizements are also published in important newspapers. When, in the case of ■such orders, it is not considered desirable to advertize on the ground of the supply being required urgently or because the goods required are of proprietary manufacture, or in cases in which the stores re quired are below Rs. 5,000 in value, an invitation is issued to a limit ed number of firms borne on the list of “ Approved Contractors ” re ferred to above, unless the supply can be arranged against a run ning or rate contract. 11. The Intelligence Branch maintains comprehensive intelligence Intelligence as to sources of supply and the capacity and reliability of firms in Branoh - India and abroad. Enquiries in regard to these matters should be addressed to the Chief Controller of Stores, Indian Stores Depart ment (Intelligence Branch), New Delhi/Simla. Information avail able will always be furnished, but it must be understood that the prices quoted will be approximate only. Definite rates, at which a particular order can be placed, can only be given after calling for tenders, and the Department cannot undertake to call for tenders unless it is the enquirer s bova fide intention to purchase the stores through the Indian Stores Department. 12. Copies of Home indents are forwarded to the Indian Stores Department by all indenting authorities after despatch to the Direc- tor General, India Store Department, London. They are scru tinized in this Branch and indentors are informed of any items which should, or might, under the Stores Rules, have been obtained in India with the object of diverting such demands to the Indian mar kets. The indenting authorities are also informed of the likely source of supply in India. This Branch also maintains lists of firms approved for the supply of important plant, machinery and iron and steel work, under the Rules for the supply of articles required to be purchased for the public service. The lists are revised and published from time to time. The publications can be obtained from the Government of India, Central Publication Branch, 3, Government Place, West, Calcutta, on payment. They are also published, when issued, in the Gazette of India, Part II, and in the Indian Trade Journal. 13. This Branch with the assistance of the provincial officers and the technical staff keeps in touch with the work in connection with the development of industries in India. 14. The Inspection Branch under the control of the Director ana of Inspection is the technical Branch of the Department, The following are its main functions : (1) To prepare all specifications and drawings required to enable tenders to be called for and to seal and main tain samples of stores to be bought to sample.'if X 4 (2) To assist the purchase branches by amplifying the information given in indents when necessary, and to advise in regard to the placing of orders for highly tech nical stores. (3) To administer and control the Inspection staff located at all the main commercial centres, and to ensure that stores delivered are in strict accordance with the speci fications and samples to which the orders are placed. (4) To administer and control the Government Test Houses at Alipore and Bombay, and the Metallurgical Inspec torate at Jamshedpur. (5) To watch deliveries and to ensure through the pro vincial inspectorates that delivery dates stipulated in the orders are adhered to, as far as possible. (6) To furnish indentors with technical advice as to the parti cular types of articles which will suit their requirements. II. —Provincial Offices. Purchase. Provincial Purchase offices are located at Calcutta, Bombay and Karachi. The officers in charge of these offices are authorized to receive indents up to certain monetary limits (see para. 33) direct from indentors and to comply with them from sources within their local areas. Indents received at Headquarters for articles of relatively small value, which cannot be obtained under a “ run ning ” or rate ” contract or combined with the demands of other indentors, are transferred to the provincial offices for compliance, subsequent correspondence with the indentor being conducted by them direct, thus facilitating expeditious supply. It should be understood that although the provincial purchasing officers can, if necessary, undertake the purchase of any items how ever small its value, it is neither economical nor expeditious, be cause of the routine procedure involved, to indent on the Indian Stores Department for articles of ordinary trade supply which the indenting officer can himself obtain locally. Indents for articles of petty value should not, therefore, be sent unless there is some real advantage in doing so, e.gr., special articles of which careful inspection before despatch is necessary, or articles for which a rate contract exists. The postal and telegraphic addresses of the provincial pur chasing officers are :— Postal Address. Telegraphic Address, Controller of Purchase, Calcutta Storchase, Calcutta.

These organizations undertake the analyses, tests and investigations of chemicals and other stores, and inspection of material purchased by the Indian Stores Department, or by any other purchasing authorities. Requests for inspection of depart mental purchases should be addressed to the nearest Inspectorate, or to the Chief Controller of Stores, Inspection Branch, Indian Stores Department, on form 1.S.D.-40, copies of which can be obtained from him or any inspectorate free of charge. 18. The charges for the services rendered by this Department are detailed in Section \ of this brochure. Where necessary, inspection in the country of origin is also arranged through the Director General, India Store Department, London. The depart mental charges levied by the Department include inspection in the country of orgin. 19. In order to afford facilities to Indian Railways to purchase from stocks held in India all classes of Railway materials of non- Indian origin, which require inspection and test during manufac ture particularly special parts of high grade value and quality such as railway axles, tyres, springs, and spring steel—an arrange ment has been introduced under which importing firms are placed m communication with the Director-General, India Store Depart ment, London, who arranges for the inspection on behalf of the firms at a charge of H per cent, for work executed in Great Britain and 2 per cent, for work executed on the Continent. This per centage is based on f. o. b. price of the stores, and the firms are at liberty to take this charge into account in assessing their sale price. . The material, on importation into India is certified by the inspecting officers of this Department stationed at Calcutta, Bombay and Karachi, as having been inspected before despatch by the Direc tor-General. India Store Department, London. In the case of special demands, the scheme will be extended to include the ins pecting officer at Madras.7 e € « No charges are made by this Department for this work, which is intended to encourage importing firms to stock certified material in India in order to meet urgent demands from Railways. 20. Messrs. Rendel, Palmer and Tritton, who have for the Consulting past fifty years been employed as Consulting Engineers to the En^,nee^s • India Office and latterly to the High Commissioner for India in respect of numerous classes of stores, have, at the instance of the Government of India, opened a branch of their firm in India with effect from the 1st of December 1928. Their Officers located at Tower House ”, Chowringhee Square, Calcutta, and their telegraphic address is “ Rendels, Calcutta ”. (1) The functions of the Branch office of the firm comprise the following among other services :— I. In relation to supplies of technical stores. —(a) When requir - ed, to prepare specifications and drawings needed for certain classes of stores, or to furnish technical advice on specifications, etc., prepared by the authorities concerned. (6) To advise if and when required, on tenders received for supply of technical stores. (c) To advise in regard to the capacity and standing of manufacturing firms abroad. II. Engineering Projects. —To advise in connection with the preparation and examination of technical projects, such as bridge designs, workshop layouts, and engineer ing schemes generally. III. Standardization. —To advise on the standardization of technical stores. IV. General. —To act as a liaison office between the Head Office of the Consulting Engineers in London and the Departments in India utilising their services. (2) These services will be available to Departments of the Central, Provincial and minor local Governments ; except in the case of the Departments and officers of the Central Government references in respect of particular projects made by these autho rities to the Consulting Engineers should be made through the Industries and Labour Department of the Government of India. This arrangement will, however, not interfere with existing arrange ments between the Governments concerned and this or any other firm of consultants, nor do the Government of India desire in any way to interfere with the freedom already enjoyed by any authority to refer questions on which they require technical advice or assistance to any firm of private consultants at their discretion. (3) The relations between the branch office of the Consulting Engineers and the Indian Stores Department will be similar to those existing between the firm’s Head office in England and the India Store Department, London.*1? H 6 » f 8 (4) The Government of India have had under consideration the question of fixing a scale of fees to be recovered from authorities (other than railways) utilizing the services of the Consulting Engineers, but in the absence of experience regarding the precise nature and extent of the services rendered to those authorities this has not been found possible. For the present therefore no specific charge will be levied in respect of these facilities, and until further orders the authorities mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) above will be at liberty to avail themselves of the services of the Indian Branch of the Consulting Engineers without pay ment ; but the Government of India propose to examine this question further in the light of actual experience, with a view to devising an equitable method of recovering the cost of these arrangements from the parties benefiting thereby. Separate orders will issue on this point in due course. III.— Classes of Stores dealt with. 21.

Indents should be submitted in duplicate on the standard Indian Stores Department indent form, supplies of which can be Stores or from any of the Purchase Circles at Calcutta, Bombay and Karachi. 23. It is essential that the appropriate certificate of availability of In the absence of this certificate the Department is not permitted to make purchases. The responsibility for the provision of funds to indenting officer. The accounts details asked for on the front page of the indent form are required for audit purposes and the proper adjustment of accounts. 24. As different classes of stores are dealt with in different sections of the Purchase Branches of the Indian Stores Department, separate indents should be prepared for stores falling under various classes, namely :— (a) Electrical stores (including wires of all descriptions). (b) Power plant and spares. (c) Engineering plant and machinery (including spares). (d) Water supply stores. (e) Structural steel work. (/) Steel sections, metals and roofing materials. (g) Oils, greases, chemicals and road-dressing materials. (h) Paints and Painter’s materials. (i) Cement, soaps and timber. IV.— Preparation of Indents. obtained on application from the office of the Chief Controller of funds on page 4 of the indent form shall be completed on all indents. cover the purchase of the stores indented for rests entirely with the(j) Miscellaneous engineering and hardware stores (including rubber goods, locks, etc.). (k) Textiles, leather and allied stores. Each separate indent should show items of a like description grouped together. Failure to comply with the above instructions will entail un necessary work and may delay compliance with indent. 25. It is essential that items indented for should be described in sufficient detail to obviate further references to the indentor, and any additional information should be given which will assist in the disposal of the indent, e.g., references to catalogues or to previous supplies. If drawings or samples are available and cannot be enclosed with the indent, they should be sent separately and marked with the indent number and designation of the indenting officer so that they can be easily connected with the indent. Reference to previous supply should also be made when duplicates are required. 26. When an item is demanded which has not previously been obtained through the Indian Stores Department, the name of the last supplying firm should be given, and when correspondence has already taken place between the indenting officer and a supplying firm or when quotations have been obtained direct in regard to any items included in an indent on the Indian Stores Department, it is essential that copies of such correspondence should accompany the indent. Failure to give an adequate description of the stores required is frequent cause of delag in supply and may result in the supply of un suitable articles. Indentors should, therefore, give this matter their special attention. 27. Specifications will be prepared, when necessary, by the technical staff of the Stores Department from the details given in the indent. 28. Indents for the purchase of plant and machinery should provide the fullest information possible and particular care should be taken to see that all peculiar local or special conditions, which might involve departures from normal standards, are mentioned. In the case of new installations of electrical plant and machinery generally the indent must clearly state whether the whole or part only of the plant is required, and in the case of additions or renewals a brief description of any existing plant with which the new plant would require to work should also be given. Such indents should state if erection at site is to be undertaken by the successful tenderer and whether a guarantee period is desired, and if so, what that period should be, and whether testing at site is to be undertaken by the Indian Stores Department.20 29. When it is desired to restrict supply to a particular iirm a specific statement to that effect should he made in the indent. Unless theie is a categorical restriction, the mention of a particular make or firm will be interpreted only as a guide to the type of article required and will not be held to preclude competitive tendering. Catalogue references and references to previous supplies are very useful, but, in the absence of any special note, will be interpreted as merely indicating the type or description of article required. The date of any catalogue quoted should be given. 30. Indents for spare parts should be compiled from makers’ spare parts catalogues, where available, and care should be taken to quote the correct symbol, number and nomenclature or code word applicable to the particular type of plant. The makers’ number of the machine should also be stated. Failing this, the date and source of original supply should be given. In contracts of this kind drawings are frequently essential. 31. It is important that in all cases indentors should state the purpose fo 1 )- which stores are required. —If this purpose is known to the Indian Stores Department, it may at times be possible to suggest slight modifications in quality or type, which would render possible the standardization among Government indentors of various articles or materials, and in this way supply would be facilitated and cost reduced. Sometimes more suitable material can be suggested. Where necessary and feasible, fair sized samples of the goods required should accompany indents. 32. Estimated cost to he entered against each item. —It is desirable that wherever possible the Stores Department should be made aware of the approximate amount which the indentor expects to pay for the stores indented for. To this end against each item the last price paid should be entered in the “ estimated cost ” column. The estimated cost of freight and the Indian Stores Department’s charges should be added to the total. If information as to the latest price paid is not available a rough estimate should be given. In the event of the quotation which it is proposed to accept being considerably higher than the amount estimated by the indentor, a reference is made to him before an order is actually placed. In the absence of any special instructions on this point, the practice is to refer to the indentor if his estimate of the toal cost of the stores demanded in any one indent is likely to be exceeded by 10 per cent, or Rs. 10,000, whichever is less, excepting when the total cost is not more than Rs. 1,000 in which case no reference to the indentor is made. on ProvInoiaJ Provincial purchasing officers are authorized to receive purchasing direct indents for any item of which the estimated cost does not oulcers. exceed Rs. 2,500 and indents for a number of items the estimated total cost of which does not exceed Rs. 10,000. In the case of item which are interconnected with each other, e.g., a power plant with 921 its various components and accessories, the demands should be grouped with reference to the potentialities of suppliers, and the limit of Rs. 2,500 shall apply to each group for which a firm may be expected to binder. Further, in order to suit the convenience of indenting authorities, the Controller of Purchase, Calcutta Circle, is authorized to deal with indents for the purchase of jute goods up to Rs. 50,000 in each case ; and the Controller of Purchase, Bombay Circle, cotton yarn for the Jail Department, Bombay Presidency, up to Rs. 25,000 in each case. Indents for stores the estimated cost of which is within these limits should therefore be addressed direct to the appropriate Provincial Purchasing Officer. 34. Indentors should state in their indents a specific date by which the stmcs are required, and expressions such as ‘ immediately ’, ‘ as early as possible ’, or 1 uryent ’, should be avoided. These expressions are constantly used, but they defeat their mm object by making it im possible for the Indian Stores Department to differentiate between the degree of urgency of the various indents. Indentors should also clearly state whether the goods are to be booked by goods or passenger train, whether at “Owners' or at “ Railway ” Risk and whether they are to be insured on rail. 35. Indenting Officers are requested to spread the demands made on the Indian Stores Department evenly over the whole year as far as possible. The concentration of a large number of orders towards the close of the year not only tends to entail extra expenditure and inconvenience but makes for difficulties in the effi cient disposal of the business connected with the purchase and inspection of stores. 3G. One of the main functions of the Indian Stores Department is the co-ordination of indents from various Government depart ments thereby enabling bulk purchases to be made or running contracts entered into with consequent saving in cost to consuming departments. To enable the Indian Stores Department to carry out this function to the fullest extent possible it is desirable that indenting officers should, whenever it is practicable to do so, con solidate their demands, for stores of which their requirements are suffi cient to effect economy by bulk purchase, into one single annual indent to be submitted by a prescribed date, in preference to demand ing their requirements in small quantities at irregular intervals. The submission of these consolidated annual demands by all departments on the prescribed dates is the ideal at which the Indian Stores Department aims. These dates are suggested as convenient for the receipt of consolidated indents for the require ments of regular maintenance stores for the ensuing financial year. If these dates are adhered to, there will be ample time for the Indian Stores Department to combine the demands of the various indentors and to place contracts for the bulk require ments, deliveries to commence in the following year.22 In their own interests, therefore, indentors are requested to co operate with the Indian Stores Department by submitting annual indents not later than the dates referred to above of the year pre vious to the financial year during which the stores will be required. 37. It is not essential that such indents should be for definite quantities of each item. The approximate quantities required will suffice, and the contracts will be so framed as to provide for the supply at any time during the period covered by the contract, of the actual requirements. The estimated quantities should, however, be reasonably approximate. The approximate dates on which deliveries will be required should be stated in the indent to facilitate supply arrangements. It is particularly requested that annual indents on the above lines be submitted for the classes of stores for which the Indian Stores Department enters into running and rate contracts. It is of course recognized that individual indents for stores of which the future requirements cannot be foreseen must necessarily be frequent, and such indents may be submitted at any time. Y.—Departmental Charges. 60 38. Under the orders of the Government of India the Indian Stores Department levies a charge of l^cr cent, for purchase and 1 per cent, for inspection or 2 per cent, in all of the total cost of orders ' ' V *'*’! placed through its agency, except in the case of orders placed on • 1 ^ behalf of non-commercial Civil Departments of the Central Govern ment. In the case of these authorities no charge is made. The charge of 1% for inspection includes all sampling and testing before the contract is concluded, and also, where necessary, sampling and testing during the currency of the contract. 39. Indentors can, if they so desire, purchase stores through the Indian Stores Department and inspect them themselves in which case the Departmental charge will be 1 per cent. only. It must be understood, however, that in such cases the responsibility of the Indian Stores Department goes no further than the placing of the order with a firm of proved reliability at the best price obtainable against a specification or sealed sample and no responsibility can be accepted for the quality of the stores delivered or for delay in supply, though any complaints on these matters will be taken up with the firm on receipt of the necessary information from the indentor. The charges for analyses and tests of chemicals and other stores, and for inspection of purchases made by other purchasing authorities, carried out at the Government Test Houses, the Metallurgical Inspectorate or any other organization under the Inspection Branch of the Department are given in detail in the schedules prescribed by the Government of India, Department of Industries and Labour, copies of which can be obtained from the Manager, Government of India Central Publication Branch. 3, “ I23 Government Place, W est, Calcutta. No charge is made for work done on behalf of the non-Commercial Civil Departments of the Central Government. dO. (a) The following procedure is followed in regard to the payment of bills for stores purchased and inspected hy the Indian Stores Department. Payment is made by the Audit Officer, Indian Stores Department, New Delhi. Indenting officers should under no circumstances make payments direct to the suppliers. • (b) Inspection .—Stores inspected by this Department are stamp ed, marked, or sealed according to circumstances wherever prac ticable. When the stores have been inspected and passed by the Inspecting Officer, the latter^will furnish the supplier with a Despatch Memorandum in duplicate (giving particulars of the inspection markings) as authority to despatch the stores detailed thereon. An inspection certificate will then be prepared with which the Des patch Memorandum should not be confused. The original Despatch Memo, should invariably be received by the consignee with the forwarding documents, and the stores received should be carefully checked and identified with the particulars shown on the Despatch Memo. In the event of a Despatch Memo, not being received, the firm should be communicated with and the stores kept without being taken on charge pending receipt. (c) The supplier will despatch the stores and will prepare his bills as detailed below: - (i) Bills for 90 per cent, of the total cost of the stores detailed on the Inspection Certificate will be prepared by the suppliers on the standard bill form of the Indian Stores Department (copies of which are furnished to the suppliers with the contract) in accordance with the instructions printed thereon and quoting the number and date of the railway receipt on which the stores were despatched. These 90 per cent, bills will be submitted in triplicate to the officer in charge of the inspection organization concerned, who will certify thereon that the stores billed for have been inspected and passed, and that they have been tendered within the time stipulated or extended by competent authority. The inspecting officer will then forward two copies of the 90 per cent, bills (including the original stamped and receipted copy) duly completed direct to the Audit Officer, Indian Stores Department, for payment. (ii) Bills for the final 10 per cent, of the cost of the stores detailed on the Inspection Certificate will be prepared in triplicate on the same forms and will be sent by the supplier direct to the consignee, supported by the Inspection Certificate received from the inspecting officer. In these 10 per cent, bills a reference will be given to the number and date of the 90 per cent, bills. Inspection of Stores and Method of Payment.24 (m) When the stores have been correctly received and taken on charge the consignee will certify the 10 per cent, bills by completing certificate No. 2 on the Bill form and will forward two copies (including the original stamped and receipted copy) duly completed without delay to the Audit Officer, Indian Stores Department, for payment who will arrange for debits to be raised against the indentor’s accounts officer. The latter will finally adjust the debits against the indentor. (w&gt;) Should the conditions of contract, as for instance in the case of contracts for the purchase of plant and machinery, stipulate instal ment payments other than as above, e.g., 80 per cent, on proof of despatch from a railway station in India or delivery at destination, and 20 per cent, after erection or final inspection and test at site, the bill for the 80 per cent, of the total cost will be submitted to the officer in charge of the inspection organization concerned who passes it on to the Audit Officer, Indian Stores Department, for scrutiny and payment. The final 20 per cent, bill will be submitted also to the inspecting officer, who will pass it on to the consignee after filling Certificate No. 1 ; and the consignee will transmit it to the Audit Officer, Indian Stores Department, after filling in certificate No. 2, for scrutiny and payment. The final bill should always be connected with the previous one by reference to the number and date of the previous bill. (v) In the case of bills for small amounts the supplier may, if he prefers to do so, submit one bill (in quadruplicate) for the full amount to the Officer in charge of the inspection organiza tion concerned for certification and transmission of three copies to the consignee, the railway receipt and the original copy of the Despatch Memorandum being sent direct by the supplier to the consignee. Such bills must be endorsed with a certificate that no bill for part payment has been, or will be, submitted to the officer in charge of the inspection organization concerned. When the stores have been correctly received and taken on charge the con signee will certify the bills and forward two copies thereof (including the original stamped and receipted copy) duly completed without delay to the Audit Officer, Indian Stores Department, for payment. (vi) In the case of stores delivered to consignees (not despatched by rail or sea) the procedure will be as described in the preceding paragraph. (d) In the case of bills for stores the inspection of which is carried out by the consignee himself (vide para. 39) 100 per cent, bills will be submitted in triplicate to the consignee concerned, who will certify thereon that the stores billed for have been correctly received, inspected, passed and taken on charge, and will forward two copies (including the original stamped and receipted copy) duly completed without delay to the Audit Officer, Indian Stores Department, for payment.26 42. Special arrangements as detailed below in regard to payment of bills and adjustment of accounts are made in order to suit the convenience of indenting authorities against whom book debits cannot be raised, e.g., ^mst-public bodies and Indian States :— The Indenting officers have the option either : (а) of placing a sum equivalent to the estimated cost of the stores 'plus the departmental charges payable for the services of the Indian Stores Department (calculated at 2 per cent, of the value if the stores are both to be pur chased and inspected, and at 1 per cent, if inspection is not required) to the credit of the Audit Officer, Indian Stores Department, in a Government Treasury, forward ing the treasury receipt to this Department; or (б) of depositing in a branch of the Imperial Bank of India in the name of the Audit Officer, Indian Stores Depart ment, a sum of money sufficient to cover the estimated cost of the stores plus departmental charges, with in structions to the bank that the sum should be strictly reserved for the purpose of meeting demands from the Audit Officer, Indian Stores Department, which should be complied with by the transfer of the amount to the Government account. The deposit receipt granted by the bank should be forwarded to this Department to enable the Department to proceed with the indent. The latter alternative has been introduced to avoid large sums of money being locked up without interest. The following extracts from a letter dated the 26th July 1927 from the Managing Governors of the Imperial Bank of India, Central Office, Calcutta, to the Chief Controller of Stores, are quoted for information :— “... .We would be prepared to issue deposit receipts in the name of the Audit Officer, Indian Stores Department, the receipts to be held by that officer, and to indicate on the receipts, by means of initials, the body on whose behalf they are issued. Your Department could then obtain payment, as and when required, in accordance with the terms of the contract. “....We have agreements with certain of the Port Trusts and Municipalities, under which we accept short-term interest-bearing deposits, and such an arrangement would probably suit these bodies. We do not, however, ordinarily accept short-term deposits at interest from public or g'wast’-public bodies with whom we have no agreement, but we would always be prepared to consider the acceptance of deposits under the proposed arrange ment, for appreciable amounts, say, Rs. 50,000 and up wards, from such bodies.” The indenting authorities are, however, subject to the procedure prescribed in clause (6) above, at liberty to enter into any27 &lt;3 arrangement regarding the deposits, which may be mutually suitable to them and the Bank. VIII.—Complaints. 43. In the event of serious complaints in regard to quality or price of stores, or delay in supply or delay in raising debits full details should be furnished to the Chief Controller of Stores, Indian Stores Department, when they will be carefully investigated. Minor complaints should, however, be referred to the supplying firm direct, and, if necessary, a copy of the complaint endorsed to the inspecting officer concerned in cases where the stores have been inspected by the Indian Stores Department. If the matter is not satisfactorily settled, it should be referred to the Chief Controller of Stores. All complaints should be made as promptly as possible, as delay may prejudice the chances of obtaining redress, particularly if arbi tration or legal proceedings are involved. Before making complaints regarding delay in supply indentors are requested to take into consideration the time required for inspec tion and for transit from place of supply to destination. Complaints are not uncommon in regard to which this consideration has been entirely overlooked. Similarly before complaining of delay in raising debits, indentors are asked to ensure that the bills have not been delayed by the consignees, it having been found that this is a frequent cause of delay in such cases. IX.— B.ejecttons and Disposal of rejected stores. 44. Cases have occurred which indicate that some misapprehen sion exists on the part of the indenting officers in the matter of the rejection of stores purchased and inspected by the Indian Stores Department, and the following instructions have accordingly been iramed in order to explain the legal position in this matter, and also to indicate the procedure which should be adopted in respect of stores which are rejected under proper authority after their arrival at their destination. It must be realized that, as the Indian Stores Department is the contracting party, the final rejection of stores lies within its compe tence alone, and that, therefore, it is not permissible for an indent ing officer or consignee to reject stores which have been accepted by that Department. In cases in which an indenting officer considers that grounds for the rejection of such stores exist, a full report should be forwarded immediately to the Indian Stores Department inspectorate concerned, and the goods complained of should be stored pending investigation by that Department and the issue of final instructions as to their disposal. Should it be decided that the stores should be rejected, intimation to this effect will be furnished immediately to the contractor by the Indian Stores Department, and he will be informed that the stores lie at his risk from the date of such rejection, and that if not removed within a fortnight of rejection the purchaser will have the right to dispose of the stores as he thinks fit at the contractor’s risk and on his account. Cases frequently occur in which stores are despatched to their destination after merely a visual examination at the contractor’s premises, works or godowns on the understanding that their final acceptance or rejection shall depend on the results of the tests carried out at the Government Test House. In such cases, if the stores are rejected, the contractor will be informed at once, and the stores will lie at the consignee’s depot at the contractor’s risk from the date of such rejection, and if not removed within a fortnight of rejection, the consignee will have the right to dispose of them as he thinks fit at the contractor’s risk and on his account. Similarly, stores, which are rejected by the inspecting officer appointed by the Indian Stores Department, after delivery, under the terms of the contract for inspection at the consignee’s depot, will lie at the consignee’s depot at the contractor’s risk from the date of such rejection, and if not removed within a fortnight of rejection, the consignee will have the right to dispose of them as he thinks fit at the contractor’s risk and on his account. Stores rejected in the circumstances indicated above and not removed by the contractor within the period allowed for such removal should be disposed of by the consignee, either by return to the con tractor or in such other manner as he considers most suited to the circumstances in each case, with the least possible delay. It should be understood that the foregoing instructions apply only to stores which are purchased and inspected by the Indian Stores Department.*■-t 1 ~ RJNNING COItIRACTC FOR TriS '/ Tdi?. 1330 3 Rate ^onxract3» Engineering Branch, Bail Roller i Timken, bearings* Bells, electric, trembling.
