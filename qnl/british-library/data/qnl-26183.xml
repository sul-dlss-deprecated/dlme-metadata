I agree with proposals in Government of India telegram Mo.774 of 21st March with regard to Kamaran post office and you may act accordinglyv Krom To No 166-^37* The Secretary to the Gotemratmt of India in the External Affairs Department, The Under Secretary of State for India, Dated Simla, the June 1937, i Sir, I are directed to address you on the subject of the establishment of a postal service between Kamaran and Jizan. In this connection a reference is invited to the letter 1 rom His Majesty's Kinister, Jsdda, to Saudi Minister lor rorei.r! Affairs, Mo.180, dated the 31st October 1935, a copy of which was sent to the Foreign Office. Since the issue of this despatch nothing further has been heard from the Jedda Legation, There has however been some correspondence on the subject between the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department and the General Director of posts, Telegraphs and Telephones, 1 ecca, but nothing has finally been decided. 2. Although no decision has yet been reached re, arding the future status of Kamaran in view of the transfer oi Aden to tfaa Oolonial Office, c.f. letter from the Government of India in the Ixternal Affairs Department, Ho. 554-H/36, dated the 20th May 1937, the Government of India have suggested in their (V&lt; 7 telegram to the Resident, Aden, Ho.774, dated the 21st larch 1937, that the Kamaran Post Office should remain under the control of the Aden Post Office. As nothing further has been heard from His Majesty’s Government on this subject, it is presumed that this suggestion has been accepted. I am therefore to enquire whether the subject of the establia;ti.eiit oi a postal service between Kama ran and Jizan should now be dealt with by the Aden Government instead oi the Government oi India. 3. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Aden Government.

There is at present a sub-Post Office of Aden Post Office on the island. If this continues it will necessitate use from April 1st of Aden stamps. Alternative is for Karaaran Post Office to be divorced from Aden and be directly controlled by Post Master General Bombay and to continue to use Indian stamps. I Gin addressing identical telegram to Foreign Delhi as decision rests with His Majesty’s Government and Govern’ 3 ment of India. I request very early reply.Previous File: P. Next File: P.
