While the use of oil paint on stretched canvases was probably derived from European tradition, the Iranians did not frame the paintings to hang individually on the walls like their European counterparts. Instead the paintings were part of an overall architectural design, fitting neatly into recessed spaces on the walls.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe subject of this portrait, Prince Yahya, was a son of the second ruler of the Qajar dynasty, Fath &lsquo;Ali Shah (reigned 1797&ndash;1834). His father appointed him at an early age to govern the province of Gilan, near the Caspian Sea. With its emphasis on his costume&rsquo;s many pearls, his prominently displayed sword, and his European-style pocket watch, the portrait captures the wealth, authority, and modernity of its youthful subject.<br />", "summary": "", "rank": 0, "label_date": "2017-09-15", "date_added": "2017-08-07 15:03:51", "approved_for_web": 1}], "artists": [{"id": 10271, "prefix": "Attributed to", "name": "Muhammad Hasan", "suffix": "", "nationality": "Persian", "role": "Artist", "dates": "Persian, active 1808-1840", "start_year": 1808, "end_year": 1840, "date_added": "2008-07-03", "rank": 1}], "collections": [{"id": 20, "name": "Arts of the Islamic World", "folder": "arts_of_the_islamic_world", "rank": 0}], "exhibitions": [{"id": 3350, "title": "Arts of Korea"}], "related_items": [], "geographical_locations": [{"id": 5172, "name": "Iran", "type": "Place made"}], "videos": [], "images": [{"filename": "72.26.5_PS11.jpg", "id": 160401, "standard_size_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size2/72.26.5_PS11.jpg", "thumbnail_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size0_sq/72.26.5_PS11.jpg", "derivatives": [{"size": "0", "width": 59, "height": 96}, {"size": "1", "width": 119, "height": 192}, {"size": "2", "width": 239, "height": 384}, {"size": "3", "width": 479, "height": 768}, {"size": "4", "width": 958, "height": 1536}], "largest_derivative_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size4/72.26.5_PS11.jpg", "largest_derivative": "4", "description": null, "caption": "Attributed to Muhammad Hasan (Persian, active 1808-1840). <em>Prince Yahya</em>, ca. 1830s.
