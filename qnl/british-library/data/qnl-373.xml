'TRIAD', No* 31 • A» Sir, I have the honour to inform you that Sheikh Syed bin Maqtum of Debai has shown himself to be an outstanding figure on the Trucial Coast during recent years. He is looked up to and much respected by all the other Sheikhs. His assistance in the Abdur Rahman negotiations in June 1926 which led to the surrender of that troublesome person and again now in making peace between Umnwal-Kawain Hamriya and Sharja and bringing SharjS- to his senses regarding the safety of the Residency Sgent, has been invaluable. By his wise conduct he has shown that he is a personage above the ordinary Sheikh and I would therefore recommend for your consideration that his gun salute should be increased from 3 to 5 guns. The salute being made personal to him only. He has in my opinion far more influence on Trucial Coast than the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi and is a strong supporter of the Grovernment in their efforts to preserve law and order. I have the honour to be, Sir, c H N The Honourable The Political Resident, BUSHIRE. 28th June, 1927. 77; V- Senior Waval Officer, Persian Gulf.f * ►' No.T.13, S • 3 • ** Ohakdara ^ the 15 th Decemhor 1927. From The Hon'hlo Lieut.Colonel L.B.H.Haworth, I.A., Political Besident in the i ersian Gulf. To The Foroign Secretary to the GJovermnent of India, New Delhi. Sir, I have the honour to send the following report on conaitions on the Trucial Coast and its deponaencies during the last six months and the measures which I have taken to maintain peace and order. In isarch of this year I received a report that Sheikhs ;hakhbut and Eaza U o sons or the late hei^h of iVbu Dhahi had lanued at the Island of Dalnmh the proper ty of the Sheikh of Ahu Diuihi, an island^ahout midv/ay lyin^; between ..atar and the capital of the ohaikhdom. Their intention was to make this island a headquarters from which to raise the tribes who were friendly to them in oraer to recover Abu Dhabi from their usurping uncle and to this end they issued letters informing their supporters that they were seizing Dftlmah with the sanction of Amir Abdullah bin Jallowi the .veil known Governor who represents Ibn 3aud at Hasa. They had indeed come direct from Uin Jallowi on their endeavour and there is little doubt that they also had the moral support of the Shaikh of tatar from whose territories they sailed and among whose subjects are many members of the tribes w hi oh support them. Their action in arriving with armed men ^as a breach of the maritime peace. Sheikh Saqar bin Zaid on hearing the news despatched armed boats to Dalma to eject the intruders2 /7 r&amp; thus again Croaking the maritime truce. On the ap roach of the Sheikh*» h^-ats the inhabitants requested Sheikhs Shakhhut and Haza to leave the island and they complied thus terminating the inoiclent without bloodshed. As however there had heen two breaches of the Truce I addressed a strong letter to the Sheikh of Ahu Phatoi, sending copies to all the Sheikhs on the Coast, warning them that I could tolerate no such conduct no matter what the provocation. It is however ohvious that if a chief is uaabio to protect his xis own islands we are morally obliged to see that he does not suffer and consequently that he must turn to us to see that his interests are protected. 2. In the month of June hostilities broke out at Shargah between the followers of the ex-3heikh Khalid and the present Sheikh Sultan bin Sagar. Bheikh Khalid was deposed three years ago by local rebellion and on Sheikh Sultan assuming power he agreed to respect the private properties of the Sheikh 1—t an agreement with which he did not comply and not content with confiscating all Sheikh Khalid*s properties he also destroyed his house in the town. iheikh 3ultan who is young and headstrong has not given full satisfaction to the people while lis be haviour towards our agent and towards the British has been at times so bad that both my predecessor, in his time, and I, in mine, have considered the question of his deposition. 3heikh Khalid has since his deposition resided at lim-al-^alwain depending largely upon the hospitality of its Jheikh. The latter finally approached the Sheikh of Shargah on the subject of maintaining his promises but without success. The Residency Agent then appealed to Syed bin 1 aqtom Sheikh or jebai. The latter said he ^as billing!. ^ ,5 to assist with Torce if necessary. May 1927 In/Khalid made an abortive attack on ^ihargali. In this attack apparently some of the Sheikh of ohargat^s own men were concerned for he blinded with red hot needles six of the men who had failed him. It looked as if thes^ hostile conditions v&lt; ere likely to drag in dt 1^4, y andr 4&lt;in Sheikhs and while I was doubtful if tKe head strong young 3heikh v/ould listen to reasonj I wrote to the Senior Naval Officer asking him to go t;0 Shargah and see if he could act as an intermediary warning the Shaikh^ of that place that I was noting his conduct which would inevitably react on his head. I also asked him to inform the ^heikhj that I h01d them responsible if there was any 'breach of the maritime peace as reported. Oaptain Parry's efforts \&lt;ere more successful than I had hoped for. Re called a meeting of jheikh of Oebai and the uheikhs concerned and A finally a peace treaty was drawn up. No breach of the maritime truce had occurred. In the new peace the Sheikh of Shargah agreed to return the value of all Sheikh Khalid^s property which he had sold,a total of .s.8500. He also agreed to return all property which had not oeen sold. Ke also agreed to return all rentals belonging to Sheikh Khalid which he had collected. He further agreed to pay an allowance of Ks.2500 per annum to Sheikh Khalid and to allow him to reside at a village xltk in the in terior and to draw rent from his properties there. Sheikh Khalid on his part agreed to trouble his cousin no longer but to live in peace. The oenior Naval Officer reports to me that he is much indebted to Sheikh Said Kaktum of Debai and his younger 'brother Sheikh Juma for the conclusion of the above treaty which was signed ta the 'Triad' on the 24th June 1927. I had warned the Senior Naval Officer to be careful tosee that we were in no way oommltted uur tnTiflrr t uio enforcing of any condition and he signed merely as a witness to the fact that these conditions had been agreed to. The Sheikh of ^hargah drew back immeaiatGly he had left the ship and showed no sign or paying up the money due from him. The Senior Naval Officer accord ingly informed him that no ship would he allowed to lei.ve Shargah for the pearling season until the amounts had heen paid up and he w: s in fact obliged to fire a blank shot across the hows of one ship before the conditions were complied with. •hen I wisited tho Sheikh of lim-al-^iwain on the 23rd November 1927 Sheikh Khalid was oressnt uhettand complained that the remaining conditions had not been complied with. On enquiry it proved he had taken no steps himself to get the conditions fulfilled and there is little doubt that he does not desire to see them fulfilled his only wish being to become sheikh once more. Nevertheless I am most obliged to uhe senior Naval Officer for his assistance in the matter since it has given me a sufficient handle to see that bloodshed is put a stop to and to enable me to use the other sheikhs of the Trucial Coast to see that peace conditions re maintained. Finally it has brought the Sheikh of Shargah to order and I do not think he will offend again. If he does I can deal with him. 3. on the ist July t o subjectiof the Sheikh of ^atar recognising in a Bahrain boat a slave who had escaped from them and who had been freed demanded his surrender. On this being refused they ; with five boat -loads of followers, a part of whom were armed with rifles attacked the Bahrain boat, beat its nakhuda and aMucted the slave.IT lb 5. V The Sheikh of Ciatar arrested the offenders and freed the slave but the Sheikh of Bahrain demanded some definite punishment of those concerned to mark the hreack of the maritime peace# I accordingly Instructed the ±olitlcal Agent, Bahrain, to obtain from the Shaikh of Bahrain a writ ten complaint regarding the incident Remanding reparation. I then instructed Captain Alban to proceed to '^a^ar and demand compensation and the punishment of the offenders. Captain Alban on arrival found the Sheikh most to see that the offenders were suitably punished but he pointed out that they were not in a position to pay a suitable fine. Ee suggested that their pearling boat in Wiilch they had committed the offence should be burnt as an example to others and this was done. I am not personally in favour of destroying things which have an economic value 'but on this occasion I think that the punishiient was one which firred the ■ f crime and a dhow blazing by night would advertise to the public the punishment for the offence and thus prevent its recurrence. I consider that Captain Alban handled this matter well. 4. A further matter was occurring which though its scene was on the Batlnah Coast of Oman South of the I^usandan peninsula was of material interest to the Jawasim Sheikhs of Shargah and Sas-al-Khaimah. While I was at Shargah in the Spring of this year the 3heikh of that place complained to me that u, a. til the Shaikh of Fujairah, a Sheikh who xm I o * the last 20 or 25 years had been subject to the Jtawasim chief ■from of itas-al-Khaimah but who / jPor the period named had maintained his independence, was oppressing the Sheikh 9tof Kall^a, a chier who is a feudatory and relation of the Jawasim ohief. Between Shargah on the Trucial Joast and Kalha on the Gulf of Oman lie the Chiefs ol ?eni Kitah and Beni Kaa'b and thus the Sheikh was unahle to ^end forces to assist the Kalha Sheikh or bring the Fujafcrah Chief to heel. Similarly under the maritime peace he was unahle to send Ms followers 'by ship. He then asked me either to permit him to send Ms men by ooat or to take the matterin hand myself. In the circumstances I requested the Senior Naval Officer to proceed to Fujairah and to see if he could not induce the two Sheikhs to see reason. The fort ol uhe sheikh of -^ujairah lies some 3 or 4 miles inland and though we had 'bomharded the most accessible of his towers and destroyed it a couple of years ago it had had little real effect. I authorised the senior ilaval Officer to use such threats as uere necessary including my giving permission for the oheikh of 3hargah to send his forces 'by ship to help his relative if he did not s ee reason. Once again the Senior Naval Officer found the Sheikh more amenable than had 'been expected. I tMnk both parties wore feeling tfc* strain of Cth-JUcC. Sheikh Isa the Hesidency ^gent of Shargah accom- panied the Senior Naval Officer^at the request of the Chief of Fujairah he went ashore to see him. The result was satisfactoryja peace has heen binned between the t o trihes and they understand that . 'C11 &amp;ny further breach .wtieyinot he well looked upon 'by us. 'hile the peace at Shargah will perhaps need further action on my part to prevent hostilities breaking out again that at Fujairah may, I think, 'be considered as final, as long as the -i-^esidency maintains its pressure.[This Docament is the Property of His Britannic Majesty 's Government.j PERSIA.

I AM commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to transmit, for the information of the Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, a copy of a report by the Commander-in-chief, East Indies, on the state of affairs in the Persian Gulf. 2. Copies of these reports have also been sent to the Colonial Office and India Office. 3.

Diyatcdawa, Ceylon, September 10, 1928. 1HL enclosed report of proceedings from the senior naval officer, Persian Gulf, is forwarded for the information of their Lordships. As this report deals with so many questions concerning the diplomatic situation with Persia and with Arab sheikhs, which are considered to call for the immediate attention of their Lordships, it is forwarded separately from the periodical letter of proceedings of Commander- in-chief, East Indies Station. 2. I rom all the reports received from the Persian Gulf during the last six months, it is apparent that by the continued delays in diplomatic channels the trust hitherto reposed by the Arab sheikhs on the British Government, and even their trust m the British navy, which they have regarded as their best friend is beino- seriously undermined. Further, that the aggressive attitude of the Persian authorities and private individuals in the Gulf is increasing, and that the lenothy and apparently ineffectual method of dealing with it is damaging the prestige of Great Britain in the eyes of both sheikhs and Persians. . . 3 t ^ reference to enclosure 3 of the report, paragraph 3, it is hoped that their Lordships will see fit to approach the British shipping companies with a view to ensuring that British merchant ships in the Persian Gulf will adhere to the general rule to prevent passengers carrying arms. ****** 5. A further enclosure containing an appreciation of the general situation by the senior naval officer is also included for their Lordships' information. B. S. THESIGER, Commander-in-Chief.

' Triad,' to the Commander-in- Chief, East Indies Station. August 17, 1928. IN continuation of the senior naval officer's letter of proceedings, dated the 17th July, 1928, the following report is submitted for the information of the Commander-in-chief :— 2. From the 18th to the 26th July the senior naval officer in H.M.S. ' Triad ' remained at Muscat, where the comparatively cool weather was of great advantage to the ship's company. His Highness the Sultan is in England at present and is not expected to return before December. His Highness's son. Prince Syed haid, has recently returned from Bagdad, where he has been completing his education at the university; the usual courtesy visits were exchanged. 3. On the 27th July the senior naval officer in H.M.S. '1 riad proceeded to Shargah, calling at Ghalla Kalba on the way to embark the sheikh of that place. This sheikh has reported that his neighbour, the Sheikh of A1 Fujairah, has broken the treaty of peace made between them in the presence of the senior naval officer in November 1927. The Sheikh of Kalba was conveyed to Shargah so that the residency aj^ent there could deal with the matter. 4. At Shargah, on the 30th July, the resident agent informed the senior naval officer that there was a serious situation in Debai in consequence of the capture of a Debai dhow by a Persian Customs motor dhow operating from Tunb Island, which belongs to a Trucial sheikh. This matter forms the subject of a separate report. 5. The residency agent also reported that a short while ago the British India steamer ' Barpeta,' when calling at Debai, had had on board a number of prisoners (smugglers) under a Persian military armed guard taking passage from Lingah to Bushire. One of the prisoners died and was buried on shore at Debai. This matter forms the subject of a separate report. 6. On the 1st August the senior naval officer in H.M.S. Triad' proceeded to Henjam for coal, and then, owing to a severe case of heat stroke on board, pro ceeded to Muscat. Owing to the serious state of affairs on the Trucial Coast, H.M.S. 'Lupin' was ordered to Debai and to visit Trucial Islands. During the present situation these islands are being visited by His Majesty's ships with frequency, and the sheikhs concerned are being urged to make quite sure that their flags are always flown there. ###*** 8. On the 2nd August information was received that the Government of India had ordered the quarantine service at Persian ports to be handed over to officials appointed by the Persian Government, with the immediate result that the Persian Government put into force an order, which is contrary to the Paris Convention, that all shipping from Bombay must now make Bushire their first port of call. This ^ matter forms the subject of a separate report. 9. As a result of the new Persian quarantine orders referred to in paragraph 8 above, the British India Company's steamers no longer call at Henjam on their voyage up the Gulf, and in consequence that port can no longer be used by His Majesty's ships of the Persian Gulf Division for embarking stores without a delay of a fortnight while the ship carrying the stores does the round trip of the Gulf, and during that fortnight the stores would have to be moved about in the ship's holds and would be exposed to even more than the usual risk of pilfering. The senior naval officer has therefore made arrangements for stores to be consigned to Muscat instead o f Henjam in the future and for the naval contractor there to receive them. This matter forms the subject of a separate letter. 10. On the 7th August the senior naval officer in H.M.S. ' Triad ' proceeded to Henjam, and thence to Debai, where the sheikhs were interviewed. 11. On the 10th August the senior naval officer proceeded to Lingah, where the consular agent stated that he had received a report from the caretaker of the coaldump at British Basidu, which he wished to investigate. On the 11th August, there fore, havino- embarked the consular agent, the senior naval officer proceeded to British Basidu in H.M.S. ' Triad. ' 12. On the 12th August the consular agent was disembarked at Lingah, and the senior naval officer in H.M.S. ' I riad proceeded to Henjam. 13. At Henjam, information was received that the issue of a proclamation restricting the movements of the people at night and prohibiting foreigners from possessing firearms was under consideration by the Persian authorities. I p to the time of writing this letter the proclamation has not been issued ; it is understood that it has been sent to Bunder Abbas for signature. 14. In view of the situation on the Trucial Coast, H.M.S. Cyclamen' has been brought down from the northern end of the Persian Gulf, and H.M.S. ' Lupin,' in response to a request received from the political resident, has been stationed at British Basidu to prevent a threatened occupation of that place by Persian troops. H. BO YES, Captain, Senior 'Naval Officer, Persian Gulf. Enclosure 3 in No. 1. (Enclosure No. 2 to Letter of Proceedings from Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, dated August 17.) Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, to Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station. Submitted. August 17, 1928. ON the 30th July, 1928, Khan Bahadur Isa-bin-Abdul Latif, the British residency agent at Shargah, came on board H.M.S. ' Triad,' and reported to the senior naval officer that there was a very grave situation at Dabai, which was being reflected along the Trucial Coast. According to his report, a motor dhow of the Persian Customs Service had seized a dhow belonging to Debai when close to lunb Island. 2. Tunb Island, according to the latest information in the possession of the senior naval officer, belongs to the Sheikh of Shargah, though the residency agent has a story that the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah also lays claim to the island. It is certain, however, that it belongs to one Trucial sheikh or another, and according to correspondence printed and bound with the Trucial treaties, the Sheikh of Shargah was recognised as the owner when the British Government established the lighthouse there. At this time of the year (July), while the men are away at the pearling, it is the custom for their families to move from their own villages to other places to get some change of air during the hot weather. 3. The dhow is owned by Bader-bin-Mohamed, who is an Arab living at Debai. The nakhuda (master) of the dhow is Ataiba-bin-Rashid, an Arab of the Beni \as tribe (of which the Sheikh of Debai is the head), and lives at Debai. She carried seven men, five women and three children passengers when she left Debai. It should here be noted that many statements as to the number of persons on board have .been given to the senior naval officer, and the truth is not easy to extract from somewhat excited Arabs, but the figures quoted above were given to the commanding officer of H.M.S. ' Lupin ' by the owner of the dhow at a meeting specially arranged for that purpose by order of the senior naval officer, and held in the presence of the residency agent and Sheikh Juma-bin-Muktum, who acts as secretary and adviser to the Sheikh of Debai. The passengers had their personal possessions with them and their food supplies for the remainder of the summer season. They were, it is understood, bound for Khasab, though some may have intended to disembark at Tunb Island. The dhow carried twenty bags of rice, five packages of dates, one box of tea and one .bag of sugar; part of this was the property of the passengers and part was to be landed at Tunb Island. The dhow expected to pick up one or two more passengers at Tunb, and then was to have proceeded to Khasab. 4. She was becalmed off Tunb Island, when the Persian Customs vessel, which had been anchored there, came out, seized her and took her to Lingah. At Lingah everything was impounded by the Customs people, and the passengers were apparently turned adrift to shift for themselves in the town. 5. When the news of this affair reached Debai the effect was so serious that the residency agent postponed his departure for his summer quarters at Ras-al- [632 p— 1] b 27 4 Khaimah, and even moved from his normal home at Shargah to a temporary residence at Debai so as to keep in immediate touch, and by his presence add moral support to the sheikh's control over the people. ■ () ^ ie residenc y a g eil t stated definitely to the senior naval officer that the Sheikh of Debai had appealed for the assistance and protection of the British Government, and claimed such protection and assistance as his right under the Trucial treaties. ^ 7. This state of affairs was at once reported to the political resident (in recess at ^hiraz), the Commander-in-chief, East Indies Station, and the Admiralty. 8. As there is a British consular agent at Lingah, the senior naval officer resumed that he would.have been aware of the matter from the first, and would ave been taking action either on his own initiative or by direction of the resident, and the senior naval officer considered, therefore, that it would .be improper for him to proceed to Lingah to carry out investigations without either a request from the consular agent or the resident. In actual fact, however, when the captured dhow arrived at Lingah the nakhuda and some of the passengers went to see the consular agent, but his munshi (a Persian) turned them away, saving that the consul was too busy to see them and that their troubles were no affair of his, and the first the consul knew of the matter was when he received a wireless message from the resident on the 8th August to make investigations. It should be mentioned here that about the time when the resident's wireless message to the consular agent was intercepted by H.M.S. £ ' Triad, the senior naval officer s interpreter. Khan Sahib Salem, informed the senior naval officer that he suspected it would be found that trouble and obstruction had been caused by this munshi, whom he knew and suspected as an especially untrustworthy Persian. 9. On the 31st July the senior naval officer visited Tunb Island, where it was found that an old man, said to have been a passenger in the dhow, had returned to Tunb Island, but he was unfortunately dying and unable to speak. The islanders stated that Persian motor dhows had been anchoring at Tunb Island for at least two months. 10. H.M.b. Triad proceeded to Henjam for coal, and then, in consequence of a seveie case of heat stroke, had to proceed to Muscat, but H.M.S, ' Lupin ' was ordered to Debai, where she arrived on the 4th August to find a critical state of affairs. A number of men whose wives were in the dhow, or who thought their wives were in the dhow, were planning to go off raiding Persians next day. Lack of certainty is one of the most difficult factors of this case, and at this season of the year, when many families are moving in craft whose owners do not publish lists of passengers, it frequently occurs that a man does not know in which particular ship his relatives are travelling, and again, in a town such as Debai, which has no connexion with the outside world save by dhow and the fortnightly mail steamer, a large portion of the populace would hear a rumour that a dhow had been captured, but would not know which one. H.M.S. 'Lupin' was accordingly ordered to remain at Debai, and to let it be known through the residency agent that she was there not with any idea of coercion but in order to pass news quickly to them by means of her wireless apparatus. Ihe sheikh and the residency agent were exceedingly worried as to the position in the town, but when the commanding officer of H.M.S. ■'Lupin' (Commander Hugh Fortescue Curry, D.S.C., R.N.) assured them that something definite might be expected from the British Grovernment in seven days, they said they hoped that this assurance, when published in the town, would restore calm among the people. This assurance given by Commander Currv has the entire approval and support of the senior naval officer. 11. On the 7th August the political resident at Shiraz instructed the commanding officer, H.M.b. ' Lupin,' to tell the residency agent to inform the Sheikh of Debai that he (the resident) was proposing to ask for monetary com pensation—10,000 rupees for the sheikh who owns Tunb Island, 5,000 rupees for the Sheikh of Debai, and 300 rupees for each person arrested in the dhow. The commanding officer, H.M.S. ■Lupin,' having consulted the residency agent, very wisely replied to the political resident that he had not passed the figures on, but instead, had had a message sent to the sheikh that compensation satisfactory to all concerned was being demanded. In actual fact, at the time of writing this letter, even that statement is causing quite sufficient difficulty, as, in their eyes, it amounts to but one more British promise which they despair of ever seeing fulfilled. 12. The political resident also suggested that Major Dickson, his secretary, stationed at Bushire, should be sent to Debai, but the residency agent there replied that Major Dickson's presence was unnecessary. In this the senior naval officer» J j /v entirely concurs, and at the present time it would be worse than useless for any person other than His Majesty's navy to visit the Trucial Coast unless invested with plenary powers to settle the whole matter. 13. On the 9th August the senior naval officer in H.M.S. ' Triad ' returned to Debai, and, in the presence of the residency agent, interviewed the Sheikh of Debai, accompanied by his two brothers; it was clear from the outset that they took a very grave view of the matter and that their patience was suffering a severe strain. Their attitude is best shown in the following notes of the conversation made at the time :— The Persians are claiming everything in the Gulf now; if we were not bound by the treaties we should send armed parties and deal with them properly, as our fathers did; but we have the treaties and we may not deal with another nation except through the Great Government; you have punished us quickly enough in the past when we have not kept to the treaties, now let us see you keep to them and help us as quickly as you used to punish us; we applied to you for help in the case of our blood relative, the Sheikh of Hen jam, three months ago, nearly, and so far as we can see you have done nothing about it. These matters are the first in which we have asked the British for help. The British Government until now has had its rights and privileges from the treaties, now let us see how it regards its responsibilities, and if it does not act in the way we say it ought to, then we will finish with the British Government and finish with the treaties. If you give way before the Persians it means that you are becoming a weak Power, and for a weak Power we have no use. When asked what they would do if they finished with the treaties they at once got very excited, and shouted : ' Never you mind ! That is our business. We have our plan all ready made up, and it will be all right, but it is our business and not yours, and we shall not tell you anything about that.' They pointed out that the whole Trucial Coast was watching events to see what the British Government would and could do. They said : ' So far we have had only promises from you—promises—promises—promises. When are we going to see some actions.' The difficulty of working through diplomatic channels was again explained to them, and they promised to be patient a little longer, but pointed out that a sheikh rules by personality and not a powerful police force, and if they cannot show results to their people very soon their power will go, and in spite of all their efforts their men will break out and probably leave the port in dhows at night.' 14. On the afternoon of the same day Khan Sahib Salem (the senior naval officer's interpreter), who is well known and well liked in Debai, went on shore to pay visits to his friends and so attempt to gauge the feeling of the people. He reported a general feeling of excitement, contempt for the Persians and doubt of the British. Among others, he met a certain Mohamed-bin-Ahmed-bin-Delmuk, who is a pearl dealer of great wealth, living in Debai; he has great power in the councils of the sheikh, and has a personal bodyguard of about twenty Bedouins; it appears that all his life he has been consistently anti-British, and if trouble occurred now he would be able to produce and pay a considerable armed force of Bedouins. He , addressed his bodyguard, in the presence of Khan Sahib Salem, with a short anti-British harangue, ending by asking where they would follow him, and the reply was shouted : 'To the mountains of Persia ! ' 15. The residency agent showed the senior naval officer a letter he had received from an Arab just returned from Lingah, in which it was stated that the people from the dhow were only released in Lingah on petition from the merchants; that the Customs officials confiscated all they had, including their boxes of clothes and private possessions and 400 rupees; that later on another petition was successfully presented by the merchants that the women should be allowed to have one extra outfit of clothes each out of their bundles or boxes; they were dispersed in Lingah in a state of beggary; some begged passages to Khasab or Salak. 16. Remembering the assurance given by the commanding officer, H.M.S. ' Lupin,' on the 4th August, and having intercepted the message from the political resident to the consular agent at Lingah (paragraph 8 above), which showed that nothing so far had been done officially at Lingah, the senior naval officer considered it imperative that he should proceed there, so that, if no message should arrive from His Majesty's Government to communicate to the Sheikh of Debai on the seventh day, the senior naval officer might possibly be able to satisfy their expectations by producing some definite information from Lingah. On the 10th August, senior [632 p—4] B 3 idnaval officer in H.M.S. ''Triad,' arrived at Lingah accordingly, and the consular agent came on board; he had very little knowledge of the affair, as nas &gt;een explained in paragraph 8 above, but was able to state that the dhow, with a remaining passengers and crew, had left in the night, a tew hours beiore H.M.S. ' Triad ' arrived, destination unknown. This was most untortunate, as, by questioning the nakhuda, the senior naval officer had hoped to be able to get at the real truth' of the story. On the other hand, the opportune release ot the dhow enabled a fact of definite value to be reported to Debai, and it was hoped that the people there would associate her release with the visit of H.M.S. Lingah, though it is known to the senior naval officer that the ( ustoms omcei at Lino-ah did not release her in consequence of any instructions from his superiors, and^in fact, has received definite orders from his superiors not to release any ot the confiscated goods. It should be added that, although this was the twelfth day since the senior naval officer had made his telegraphic reports on the matter the Customs officer stated he had received no orders or communications from Tehran about it at all. , i i 17. The senior naval officer asked the consular agent to return on shore and make certain enquiries from the Persian Customs officials; this he very kindly di , and in the evening brought off the results to H.M.S. ' 1 riad. Tie said the Directoi of Customs had objected to making any statement, as he feared that if his story should ever be repeated in Tehran and quoted as being evidence obtained by the British from him, he would certainly be dismissed and would quite likely be killed; the consular agent assured him that'the senior naval officer would not let the source of the information be reported at 1 ehran, and the senior naval officer has, or course, given his word to the consular agent to this effect. Before giving the statements of the Customs officials, the following remarks of the consular agent should be noted : The Customs director said, before he gave his statement proper : ' What is all this trouble about a mere dhow; we have been seizing dhows on the seas for the past six months, and no one has made any complaint; what is the reason for this complaint now; it must be another effort oi the Sheikh of Debai to get at us through the British about the Sheikh of Henjam. I expect Isa (the residency agent at Shargah) has taken it up because I made the nahkuda oi the dhow that brought his munshi here pay 150 rupees for smuggling on an earlier trip ' The consular agent also brought the following facts to the notice ot the senior naval officer :— The residencv agent s munshi has only just left Lingah aftei a month s leave; he must have known something of this case, yet, although he frequently saw the consular agent, he never mentioned it. The residency agent at bhargan could have written to his munshi, but apparently did not do so. The munshi, however, is a Persian, with property in Lingah, and if he were told to take any steps about the matter would quite likely be afraid to do so. The consular agent recently had a private letter from a brother ot the Sheikh of Debai and from the residency agent at Shargah, yet neither of them mentioned the matter of the dhow. The consular agent did not give the dates of these letters, but it is quite possible that they were actually sent from the Trucial Coast before the first news about the dhow reached Debai. Rumours travel fast in this part of the world, but letters go slowly. The following is the information obtained by the consular agent from the I ingah Customs officials :— Statement of Evidence of Mirza Haider, the Inspector of Customs, Lingah, dated August 10, 1928. ' I was on inspection duty, and owing to a strong ' kows' wind blowing, I ordered the Customs launch to anchor at night at a mile from Tonb Island (N.W.). ' The next morning I noticed a dhow that had anchored the same direction as my launch. It was a mile from lonb, and aiso a mile from my launch. 1 then' inspected the boat and saw that there were six passengers, three men, two women and one child. It also was manned by a crew of six, one nakhuda and five boatmen. The crew were all Persians belonging to Qishm districts. Out of the passengers, the men were all Persians, and the women were Arabs. ' I noticed on my inspection that the dhow had tea and sugar, so I seized same I did not seize the private property of the passengers. I then orderedthe boat to be tied to my launch and intended towing' them to Iroor Island On my way to Froor I saw a sailing boat going to 1 ^' hed and told the women passengers that they may proceed to Khasa nn the sailiiK' boat.

'Director: Yes— tea and sugar. , . . . . • 'Consul: Why was the Customs launch at Tonb which is not Persian territory ?' Director: Tonb belongs to Persia. 'Consul: Why was the dhow attacked at sea? 'Director: For confiscation of smuggled goods. I may point out it was not attacked, only temporarily seized. If goods were for Fonb Island it would not have been confiscated, but according to a statement made before merchants, by the nakhuda, a portion of the goods were for Mahtabi, Qishm and Khasab. If cargo had been free of sugar and tea, it would not have mattered, but, according to our instructions, if we find a boat with sugar and tea in any small port it is confiscated. The boat was temporarily seized also because it was anchored within 10 kilom. of Tonb, between Lingah and Tonb (Persian waters). 'Consul: When is the tea and sugar to be given back? 'Director: After T receive instructions from Bushire. In conclusion T might say that the nakhuda had no pass for his cargo, and therefore it was temporarily seized. Five passengers had no passports to enable the Customs to know where they were coming from, or where they were going to.' British Consular Ag'ent, Lingah. 18. The discrepancies between the Persian statements and those of the Arabs will be noted. On the whole the senior naval officer is of the opinion that the Arab story is nearer to the truth. Orders have been given by the senior naval officer that if the dhow is seen again or if any of its passengers reach Debai, depositions are to be taken with the greatest care. 19. On the 13th August a letter was received in Debai from a merchant at Lingah, saying that the Director of Customs there wished to open direct negotiations with the Sheikh of Debai, and that he proposed to come in a steam-launch to interview him. The sheikh loyally holding to his treaty obligations refused the proposal and the senior naval officer has issued orders that no Persian officials are to be allowed to land on the Trucial Coast. 20. The position now is that nineteen days after his application for British assistance in this matter the Sheikh of Debai has not received any answer, which in his eyes resembles practical results and British prestige on the Trucial Coast is steadilv sinking. H. BOYES, Captain, Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf. Enclosure 4 in No. 1. (Enclosure No. 3 in the Senior Naval Officer's Letter of Proceedings, dated August 17, 1928.) Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, H.M.S. 'Triad,' to the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station. Submitted, August 17. 1928. ON the 30th July, 1928, the senior naval officer received a report from the residency agent at Shargah to the effect that a few days previously when the ' Biss Barpeta ' went through that port she had on board a number of Persian prisoners (smugglers) under an armed military guard; that the prisoners were being conveyed to Bushire for trial; that they had been embarked at Lingah; and that one badly wounded man who died en route was landed and buried at Debai. On further investigation it appeared that two dhows owned on the Tungistan coast, and therefore Persians, loaded in Bahrein and attempted to run their cargoes through to the Persian coast. They were sighted by a Persian Customs launch near Shaikh Shu'aid Island and a fight ensued; one dhow escaped and the other surrendered after all ammunition was expended and several of its crew had been killed. The captured dhow was taken to Lingah. The prisoners, as related above, were shortly afterwards embarked in the 'Biss Barpeta' under an armed military guard for passage to Bushire. 2. On the 8th August the 'Barpeta' arrived at Henjam, where H.M.S. ' Triad ' was anchored, and the master very kindly came over at the request of the senior naval officer. He said it was quite true that his ship had carried these prisoners with their guard on the last upward voyage, and he thought but little of it; when, however, the senior naval officer suggested to him that instead of Persian Tungisiris the prisoners might well have been Arabs from Debai, and that in that1 L-- v case, in the present angered state of that district, the people of Debai would quite likely have endeavoured to rescue their compatriots, while he was anchored oft that port he realised that there was another view of the question. He informed the senior naval officer that armed Persian soldiers are frequently carried as deck passengers, especially between Bushire and Mohammerah, and that private individuals taking passage between various Gulf ports often travel armed. He stated that nothing was done in either case to deprive them of their arms or ammunition while on board, and smiled when he was reminded that a British officer travelling in the P. &amp; O. Company's ships has to put even his shot-gun cartridges ki the ship's magazine. He said he had never received any warning from consuls or the ship's agents before embarking Persian armed soldiers, and added that, as a matter of incidental interest, no member of the ship's staff possessed any firearms. 3. In view of the fact that consequent upon the activities of the Persian Customs Service the Arab coast is in a disturbed state, the senior naval officer recommends that British shipping companies be advised not to accept any Persian guard with prisoners as passengers, and that when armed Persian soldiers, or any other individuals with arms, are embarked they should be deprived of their arms and ammunition while on board as passengers. H. BO YES, Captain, Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf. Enclosure 5 in No. 1. (Enclosure No. 11 in the Senior Naval Officer s Letter of Proceedings, dated August 17, 1928.) Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, H.M.S. ' Triad, ' to the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station. August 17, 1928. IT is submitted for the information of the Commander-in-chief that the increasing activities of the Persian Customs Service operating outside territorial waters and the generally aggressive attitude of the Persians, both officials and private individuals, are causing much ill-feeling on the Trucial Coast, where the Arabs, who have the greatest contempt for all Persians, both individually and as a nation, are with difficulty restrained from taking direct action to protect themselves and obtain revenge. It is without any doubt true that it is only their fear of the guns of His Majesty's ships which has, so far, kept them under control. 2. This, from the naval point of view, introduces a novel situation in the Gulf. Hitherto His Majesty's navy has largely been employed keeping the peace amongst the Arabs and preventing them from preying upon other peoples. Now, on the other hand, the Arabs, appealing to the reciprocal clauses of the Trucial treaties, demand that His Majesty's navy shall protect them and their shipping from the Persians. 3. Debai, as is notorious, is a centre from which goods of all sorts are smuggled into Persia, and so long as the Persian Customs Service do not in their activities exceed the conventional bounds of international law no exception to their operations will be taken by the Arabs, but, unfortunately, they are operating all over the Gulf, causing serious interference to normal and lawful Arab trade. Not content with this form of annoyance, they aggravate the Arabs by announcing everywhere that they own the whole Gulf, including the Arabs' own territory, and take every opportunity of creating ill-feeling. Furthermore, they are endeavouring to weaken British control over the Trucial Arabs by calculated insolence and the spreading of rumours. Were one dealing with European civilised peoples these matters would appear too childish to be mentioned, but, unfortunately, the impression they make upon the Arabs is serious, and one has the additional difficulty that, while we treat the Persians, who behave like spoiled children, as a well-conducted European nation, the Arabs regard them as less than civilised and degenerate drug-takers as well. From which it follows that the Arabs are completely mystified by our attitude and our repeated statements that when dealing with Persia matters have to go through diplomatic channels. 4. As Arab patience may soon be exhausted, it is necessary that the Commander-in-chief should be aware of the present heated political atmosphere and its causes. In this connexion it must be remembered that in 1926 the Arabs were already complaining of Persian aggression to the political resident. Their Id10 complaints about the ill-treatment of the Sheikh ol ilenjam are still unanswered (senior naval officer's letter of the 5th June, 19^8), and there is little doubt that the real origin of that matter is to be found in the arrest by the Persians of a dhow belonging to the Sheikh of Henjam in the first half ot 1927; this arrest took place on the high seas when the dhow was on its way from Old Henjam to Debai; in addition to the cargo, it is alleged that 4,000 rupees were confiscated from the dhow by the Persians on this occasion. 5. In May 1928 a Trucial sheikh asked the senior naval officer what was the truth of the Persian claim to Bahrein which he had heard they were making; the senior naval officer said, of course, that there was nothing in it. But within the past few weeks the Persian chief finance officer from Bunder Abbas, when on a tour of inspection in Lingah, announced that he was shortly proceeding to Bahrein to inspect the British finance officer's work and so forth. The senior naval officer heard of the origin of this story from a reliable source in Lingah, and the story itself, of course, has made its natural impression on the coast, where many are now inclined to yv believe that we shall soon admit the Persian claim and evacuate Bahrein. 6. The Arabs know full well that the Persians claim the whole Gult; we deny it; then they hear that a big British cruiser was prevented from going alongside to take oil at Abadan, and the story coming from Persian sources has lost nothing in the telling, whereupon the Arab suspects us again. Fine points of boundaries mean little to him, and, as he has always heard that the British are supreme on the seas, he cannot understand a Persian preventing our ships from oiling unless our power amounts to bluff after all. 7. Great Britain has always in the eyes of the Arabs been the Power that keeps the peace on the waters and will not allow others to go armed and fighting at sea, yet, while not permitting the Arabs to be armed at sea, we permit the Persian motor dhows to attack them. 8. Great Britain has been the Power that has preserved the freedom of the seas, yet now Persia claims all water from Lingah to Tunb Island, and Great Britain has done nothing about it. 9. They thought Great Britain owned Henjam, and they know we had soldiers there in the Great War, yet now the Persians have their troops there. It may be mentioned here that in Lingah the accounts of the capture of Henjam and the defeat of the Royal Marines by the gallant Persian troops and the final evacuation of the place by ^ the British 'are wonderful examples of the story-tellers's art, but, unfortunately, all these things are reflected to our detriment on the Trucial Coast, where the people, asking for our assistance and receiving only words and delay for an answer, are definitely doubting our ability to put words into actions. 10. The Persians claim Tunb and Abu Musa Islands, which belong to Trucial sheikhs, and the Persians anchor their Customs motor dhows and launches there when waiting to catch trading dhows, and Great Britain seems to tolerate it. Persia is also claiming Ras-al-Khaimah; what will Great Britain do if they send and put a custom-house there? In actual fact it seems to be quite definite that the Persians are thinking of attempting to put customs depots with the necessary officials on Tunb and Abu Musa Islands; the position as regards Ras-al-Khaimah is a trifle obscure; the sheikh there is not well disposed towards us, and it would not be surprising to learn that he has been corresponding with Persian officials, and there is no doubt that the Persians would give him a good bribe to let them get a good foothold there; in fact, the bribing of any discontented sheikh to turn against us might occur at^N any time. 11. When Arab trading dhows anchor at Lingah the Persian authorities make them haul down the Trucial flag and keep it down so long as they are in the port. British policy has always been to encourage the Trucial Arabs to keep their flags flying wherever they go, and this Persian order is, of course, simply an attempt to defy the British and show us to the Arabs as being a people of no account. H. BOYES, Captain, Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf.CONFIDENTIAL. INDIA OFFICE APPENDIX. Precis of the Treaties and Engagements between the British Government and the Chiefs of the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf. KOWEIT. (a) Agreement dated 23rd January 1899.—The Sheikh pledged himself and his heirs and successors not to receive the Agent or Representative of any Power or Government at Koweit . . . without the previous sanction of the British Government . . . and not to cede, sell, lease or mortgage or give for occupation or for any other purpose any portion of his territory to the Government or subjects of any other Power, without the previous consent of His Majesty's Government. (b) Letter from Lieut.-Col. Meade, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the Sheikh of Koweit, dated 23rd January 1899, accompanying (a):—The Sheikh was formally assured ' of the good offices of the British Government towards you, your heirs and successors as long as you, your heirs and successors scrupulously and faithfully observe the conditions of the said bond (i.e. the agreement above).' N ote .—In 1911. when the text of the x^greement of 1899 was com municated to the Turkish Government, the text of Col. Meade's accompanying letter was not similarly communicated; but the Turkish Government was told in Sir E. Grey's covering note that 'His Majesty's Government have informed the Sheikh of Koweit that so long as he and his heirs and successors act up to their obligations under the Agreement, His Majesty's Government undertake to support them and accord them their good offices. His Majesty's Government reserve to themselves the right to interpret that term at their discretion/ 1 The attitude adopted at the time by His Majesty's Government towards this undertaking is illustrated by the following extract from India Office letter dated the 30th October 1911 to the Foreign Office ' The term ' good offices' ... is a conveniently vague one, and Lord Crewe is of opinion that it is neither necessary nor safe to go beyond it. The action taken by His Majesty's Government in 1901-2, when men and guns were landed at Koweit to defend it against unprovoked Turkish aggression, will, moreover, have made it plain to the Porte in what way we are prepared to interpret the term if necessity arises.' (c) Agreement of the Sheikh of Koweit, dated 24th May 1900, to prohibit the importation of arms into, and their exportation from, Koweit. (d) Postal Agreement, dated 28th February 1904, giving His Majesty's Government the sole right to erect a post office at Koweit. (e) Secret Agreement, dated 15th October 1907, for the lease of the Bunder Shweikh foreshore.—In the fifth article of the two documents constituting the agreement the Sheikh reaffirmed his pledge not to cede, sell, &amp;c., any Koweit territory to any foreign Government or foreign subject without His Majesty's Government's permission. In the ninth, the British Government promised that the town of Koweit and its boundaries belong to . . . the Sheikh of Koweit and to his heirs after him, and that all Sheikh Mubarak's arrangements in the matter of customs, &amp;c., and his arrangements at the present day shall remain in the hands of Sheikh Mubarak-as-Subah, ruler of Koweit, and his heirs after him . . .' N ote —The lease, or rather the payment of rent for the Bunder Shweikh site, was terminated in 1922. It does not appear, however, that the agreement was abrogated, and the reciprocal pledges, so far as they are not affected by other subsequent instruments, presumably remain binding. 3138 75 10.28 a■■■BHaHHHI i Aitchison, Vol. XII, p. 172.

(/) Pearl fishing and Oil. —The Sheikh undertook in 1911 not to grant a pearl fishing concession to foreigners save with the prior approval of His Majesty's Government. He gave a similar imdertaking as regards oil in 1913. (cj) Letter dated 3rd November 1914 from the Political Resident to the Sheikh, in which the Sheikh was given, in return for his co-operation against the Turks, certain assurances of which the third was that ' Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.' (/i) The undertakings given to Sheikh Mubarak were renewed in 1917 to his son Jabir, and again, on his accession, to the latter's successor, his brother Salim. To Salim, who proved troublesome. Government in 1918 gave a warning that the assurances conveyed to him on his accession were conditional on his good behaviour. (See Memorandum on Koweit on page ® para. 20.) &amp; (/) In a Kharita delivered on 19th July 1921 the Viceroy renewed to the present Sheikh, Ahmad al Jabir, nephew of Salim, the assurances given to the latter. BAHREIN. (a) In 1820 the Ruler of Bahrein subscribed to the general treaty with the Arab Chiefs of the Persian Gulf, which prescribed abstention from plunder and piracy by land and sea, from slave traffic, and from inter-tribal war, and peace with the British Government. (The adherence of Bahrein to this treaty gave the British Government a formal right to intervene, as it did in 1863, between Bahrein, Abu Dhabi and Katr, and again in 1867-9.) ib) In 1817 the Sheikh of Bahrein subscribed to an engagement for the abolition of slave trade in his ports and for the submission of Bahreini vessels to search by British cruisers for slaves, and to seizure if guilty, and in 1856 signed a further engagement for the better suppression of the slave trade. (c) On the 31st May 1861 Sheikh Mahomed bin Khalifa signed on behalf of himself and his heirs and successors a 'perpetual treaty of peace and friendship with the British Government.' In Article 2 he agreed to abstain from maritime aggression, war, piracy and slavery by sea ' so long as 1 receive the support of the British Govern ment in the maintenance of the security of my own possessions against similar aggressions directed against them by the Chiefs and tribes of this Gulf.' In Article 3 he undertook to refer to the arbitration of the Political Resident cases of aggression by sea on Bahrein or Bahreinis and to refrain from retaliation without the Political Resident's assent. ' And the British Resident engages that he will forthwith take the necessary steps for obtaining reparation for every injury ... by sea upon Bahrein or . . . its dependencies.' (d) On 22nd December 1880 Sheikh Isa signed an agreement binding himself and his successors not to enter into negotiations with any State or Government other than the British without the consent of the British Government, and to prevent the establishment of diplomatic or consular agencies or coaling depots, other than British, without the consent of the British Government. ' This engagement does not apply to or affect the customary friendly correspondence with the local authorities of neighbouring States on business of minor importance.' V c ) On the 13th March 1892 Sheikh Isa signed a further agreement the first two articles of which reaffirmed his undertaking to abstain from relations with foreign Governments; in the third article he undertook 'on no account to cede, sell, mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation any part of my territory save to the British Government.' (/) In 1898 the Sheikh of Bahrein signed an agreement to prohibit the traffic in arms in Bahrein territory.^*1 5'- r (g) In 1911 the Sheikh agreed not to allow any foreign Power to open a Post Ollice in Bahrein, and not to grant a pearl fishing or sponge fishing ■concession to foreigners. In J 914 he agreed not to search for oil himself or give others permission to do so without consulting the Political Agent and receiving the approval of the Government of India. EL-KATR. (a) In 1808, as a result of hostilities initiated in Katr by the Sheikh of Bahrein in co-operation with the Sheikh of A.bu Dhabi, and continued by a retaliatory attack on Bahrein by Katr, Sheikh Mahomed bin Thani executed an agreement to abstain from hostilities and to accept the arbitration of the Resident, particularly in disputes as to the tribute payable to the Sheikh of Bahrein, to whom the Sheikhs of Katr were then in some degree subordinated. (h) Shortly after, the Turks established themselves in Katr; and though the British authorities did not hesitate to have direct dealings with the Sheikhs of Katr, no written agreement was made with them. (c) In the course of the negotiations with the Turkish Government in 1913 it was agreed that the southern and eastern limit of ' le Sandjuk Ottoman de Nedjd ' should be a 'une ligne partant du fond extreme du golfe faisant face a Tile de Zahnounie (i.e. the Bay of Salwa to the west of El Katr) qui ira directement au snd jusqu'au Ruba'-al-Khafi et separera le Nedjd de la presqu'-ile de I'El-Katr.' Further, it was agreed that ' le Gouvernement de Sa Majeste Britannique—ne permettra pas au cheikh de Bahrein de s'immiscer dans las affaires interieures d'el-Katr, de porter atteinte a 1'autonomie de ce pays on de I'annexer.' (d) The separation of El Katr from Nejd and its independence of Bahrein having been thus established (though not thereby given effect), the way was open for the conclusion of a Treaty signed on 3rd November 1916 after the Turks had finally been expelled from El-Katr in the course of the war. In this treaty the Sheikh takes note of, undertakes the obligations Articles I and II. resulting from, and is promised the advantages accruing from the various •engagements concluded by the Trncial Chiefs for the suppression of slave trade and piracy and the preservation of the maritime peace. In Article III he undertakes to prohibit arms trade in Katr and to observe the arms traffic rules of the British Government. In Articles I\ and V he undertakes to have no relations with the Agent of any other Power without the consent of the British Government, or to cede land by lease, sale or gift or to grant monopolies, concessions or cable landing rights. In Articles \ II, VIII and IX he undertakes to protect British residents and, if required, receive a British representative, and establish a British post and telegraph office. In return the British Government undertakes in Articles X and XI to protect the Sheikh, iiis subjects and territory from all aggression by sea, and to grant their good offices should he or his subjects be assailed by land within the territories of Qatar ; it being understood that this obligation only applies in the event of such aggression by land or by sea being unprovoked by the Sheikh or his subjects. N ote .—From para. 10 of the Memorandum on the Trucial Chiefs on p. B| ^ will be seen that on the question being raised by the Sheikh in 1922 of the assistance which he might expect from Government in the event -of an attack by Jbn Saud, he was informed that His Majesty's Government were not prepared to promise more than diplomatic assistance. TRUCIAL COAST (Ras-nl-Khaima, Abu Dhabi, Dabai, Shargah, Ajman, Umm al Qaiwain). (a)^ In 1820 these chiefs signed the general treaty (see Bahrein (a)) prescribing perpetual abstention from plunder and piracy by land and sea. and from irregular (i.e. unproclaimed) war; registration of dhows; peace with the British Government; abstention from the carrying off or transport oi slaves; free entry of their ships into British ports; 'and if any shall attack them the British Government shall take notice of it.' ■ ::: ' 1 hem in the context appears to mean the ships of the signatory Chiefs; but it may mean the Chiefs.(6) In 1828, 1830 and 1847 agreements were entered into by these Chiefs for the snppreshion ol' slave trade, and for the search and, if necessary, seizure by British warships of any of their vessels suspected of engaging in this trade. (c) In 1843 a Maritime Truce for ten years was signed by these Chiefs 41 being fully impressed with a sense of the evil consequences arising from our subjects and dependents being prevented from carrying on the pearl fishery without interruption on the banks, owing to the various feuds existing among ourselves ' This Truce cancelled the right of the Chiefs, implied in the general Treaty of 1820, to wage regular war on each other. Under the Truce they agreed to refer disputes and cases of aggression to the decision of the Political Resident. In 1853 the Truce was renewed in perpetuity. {d) In 1892 exclusive agreements were signed by all the Trucial Chiefs, on behalf of themselves, their heirs and successors, that they will on no account enter into any agreement or correspondence with any Power other than the British Government; that without the consent of the British Government the}'' will not consent to the residence in their territories of the agent of any other Government; and that they will on no account cede, sell, mortgage,, or otherwise give for occupation, any part of their territories, save to the British Government. (e) In 1902 the Chiefs undertook to prohibit the importation of arms into,, and their exportation from their territories. (-/) In 1911 the Sheikhs undertook not to give pearling or sponge fishing- concessions, save with the prior approval of His Majesty's Government. (g) In 1922 similar undertakings were given regarding oil. OMAN (MUSCAT). (1) Treaties and Agreements with Great Britain. (a) Treaty relations date from 1798, when an agreement was made by the Imam with the East India Company to exclude the French and Dutch from his territories 'whilst warfare shall continue between the English Company and them.' (h) In 1822 a Treaty for Suppression of the Slave Trade was signed, providing inter alia for action by the Imam's oilicers in Muscat territory, and for seizure, outside certain limits, by the British of any vessels carrying slaves to Christian countries. (c) In 1839 a Commercial Treaty was concluded on a reciprocal most favoured-nation basis, providing for the purchase, sale or hire of lands by British subjects in Muscat territory, appofntment of Consuls, protection of Muscat subjects in British employ, extraterritoriality for British subjects, unrestricted trade, limitation of import duties to 5 per cent, and freedom from export duties. (d) In 1839 and 1845 further enactments reinforced the right of British vessels to detain and search and if necessary confiscate Muscat ships suspected of carrying slaves, outside certain limits. (e) In 1862 an Anglo-French Declaration was signed under which the French Government and Her Majesty's Government engaged reciprocally to respect the independence of the Sultans of Muscat and Zanzibar. (/) In 18G4 the Sultan agreed to permit the construction of, and to protect, one or more telegraph lines in his own territories or in those leased by him from Persia. But no sovereign right was to be conferred on the British Government over any such territory. This was followed in 1865 by a similar convention in respect of His Highness' territories in Arabia and Mekran. (g) In 1873 a further Treaty for the Abolition of the Slave Trade was concluded. This extended the powers of seizure possessed b}' British vessels to include seizure of Muscat vessels trading between Muscat ports: the Sultan undertook to shut all slave markets in his dominions and to protect liberated slaves. (/i) In 1891 a new Treaty of Commerce, Friendship and Navigation was concluded, which cancelled the Treaty of 1839, but was framed on similar lines. Coals, provisions, &amp;c., for Her Majesty's ships were to be exempt from duty (Art. 6). No export duties were to be levied without the consent of Her Majesty's Government. This treaty, like that of 1839, provided a capitulatory regime for British subjects.£ r (i) In 1891 an Agreement was also signed by the Sultan, pledging him Aitchison, Vol. XII, never to cede, sell, mortgage or otherwise give in occupation any of his dominions or dependencies, save to the Ijiitish Ooveinment. (?) In 1895 a guarantee was given to the Sultan that, whatever the differences between the Sheikhs of Oman and the Sultan, Government would not allow the former to attack the two towns of Muscat and Mattrah. The Sultan issued a notification in these terms. The warning was renewed in 1913 p. 2749/13. {k) In 1898 a proclamation was issued giving British and Persian vessels AitchUon, vol. xn, the ri o ht to search British, Persian or Muscat vessels in Muscat waters, and 11 Muscat vessels in British or Persian waters, for arms and ammunition. (1) In 1902 the Sultan undertook to grant His Majesty's Government the no., p.242. first option on mining rights in the Sur coalfields. _ , . , (m) In 1903 the Sultan issued a notification authorising the searching by Mem0 - |{ '^ l '*- British and Italian ships, both on the high seas and in Muscat waters, of Muscat vessels suspected of carrying arms to certain prohibited African areas. . . . , (&gt;t) In 1923 the Sultan undertook not to give any oil concession without the consent of His Majesty s Government. (ii) Treaties with other Powers. (а) In 1833 the Sultan concluded a Treaty of Amity and Commerce with Do .,p. clx. the United States of America providing for perpetual peace, unrestricted trading (except that muskets and ammunition might not be sold to private persons in Zanzibar), limitation of import duties to 5 per cent., reciprocal most -favoured-nation treatment in regard to trading charges, and appointment of consuls. . . _ . ( (б) In 1844 a Treaty of Commerce was concluded with France in terms almost identical with the British Treaty of 1839. (c) In 1877 a short Treaty with Holland provided reciprocal most -favoured- do., p. clxxx. nation treatment for the nationals of each country, both generally and in respect of import duty and the regulations regarding export and transit. SUMMARY. 1. The following are common to the engagements of all the above Aral) States to the British Government:— . The undertaking not to cede, sell, mortgage, &amp;c., any of their territory except to the British Government, or to give any oil concession without permission. ... The undertaking to prohibit the traffic of arms in their territories, and (except in the case of Koweit) the undertaking to suppress slave trade. 2. The following is common to all, except Muscat; — The undertaking to have no negotiations with, or receive the repre sentative of, any Power other than the British Government, except with the consent of the British Government, and the undertaking not to give an} pearling or sponge fishing concession without permission. 3. The following is common to all except Koweit, and it is implied in the case of Koweit:— _ . , l The undertaking to maintain peace in perpetuity with the British Government. 4. To all, except Muscat, the British Government promises protection from aggression by sea, either explicitly or, as to the Trucial Chiefs, by implication. 5. To El-Katr the British Government promises also 'good offices ' in the case of aggression by land. 6. To Koweit the British Government undertakes unqualified ' protection.' Communication of Treaties. 1. To the Turkish Government in 1911. All the treaties prior to 1911 regarding Koweit, El Katr, and the 1 racial Chiefs mentioned in this Memorandum, with the addition of one or two 3138 B6 minor agreements not mentioned, but without the Bunder Shweikh Secret Agreement (Koweit {d)), were communicated to the Porte in connection with the general negotiations for the Anglo-Turkish Agreement. (See also Note on Koweit (6)). 2. To Ibn Saud in 1927. Article 6 of the Treaty of Jeddah (19-7) runs as follows:— 'His Majesty the King of the Hedjaz and of Nejd and its dependencies undertakes to maintain friendly aud peaceful relations with the territories of Koweit and Bahrein, and with the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman Coast, who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty's Government.' jeddah Deep.133. The Foreign Office have accordingly communicated to Ibn Saud copies of Dec.4192&lt;, i .73/28. ^ rea ti es given to Turkey in 1911, together with the £1 Katr treaty of 1910, and a complete set of the Muscat treaties witli His Majesty's Government as published in Aitchison. He has also been informed of the 'good offices' accorded to Koweit. and of the provisions of Article 9 of the Bunder Shweikh Agreement. 3. To the Persian Government. f.o. tel. 186, Sept. 4 In September 1928 His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires, Teheran, was instructed to communicate to the Persian Government the text of the exclusive agreements of 1892 with the Trucial Chiefs.

Xhe Senior Naval Officer then sent liie following telegram to tne honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf ;- '.^th reference to Lupin's report on Debai affairs Senior Naval Officer strongly urges full British support for Sheikh Saied. From personal experience Senior Naval Officer can say that during 1928 the loyalty of Uiis Sheikh to British Government was a predominant factor in keeping the Trucial diiefs and Ooast quiet. n 3. The merchant described in paragraph 15 of 'Lupin's' report as Ahmed bin Hemed bin Dilmuch is really Mohamed bin Ahmed bin Delmuch and was previously referred to by xhe Senior Naval Officer in his submission No. 40 da^ed 17 th August 1928 /, f i LJ (paragraph-3*)\ » This man is said to be the InJl - /*. , weal thief? t mex-chant in Debai and has proportionate .

It is worth recording that he has consistently refused ever to go on board H.M.Ships. 4. with reference to para-^raph 8 of •*Lupin's' report it is not inopportune to bring to mind that by direction of the Honourable the Political Resident the Sheikh of Debai was told on 7 th August 1928 that financial compensation for the Dho_w_incident at Tunb was being demanded but so far as is known to the Senior Naml Officer, no compensation has as yet, ten months after the incident, been paid to the Sheikh.

Political Resident) which showed the position in which the Sheikh found himself. Upon a numbe. of other occasions during, the second half of 192Q The Senior Naval Officer drew attention, in roports an d» *and telegrams, to tne difficulties which loyalty to the British Government was creating for this Sheikh because in the eye of tne world the British Government seemed to offer him no concrete support or mark of approval in return. 6« The Senior Kaval Officer now urges/^itron^Ly as he can that the Government of India be prevailed «pon to authorise without delay (a) The granting of financial compensation for the Dhow incident regardleBS of whether the matter has been settled with the Persian Government or not. (b) The increase of the Salute to Sheikh Saied of Debai from 3 to 5 guns. This matter was first proposed by the Senior Naval Officer two years ago (letter 21.A of 28th June 1927 aadressed to Xhe honourable the Political Resident). (c ) The giving of some honour or present of considerable value to the Sheikh as a personal mark to snow that his consistent loyalty is really appreciated. CAPTAIN.

It w-as knovm that ^&gt;heikh Saied was friendly with the Bedouin and that he had paid them considerable subsidies, ^.re- surably in order to ensure their su^ort on just such an occasion as this. 11. In s^ito of his professed anxiety to avoic. bloodshed, it seeaed very doubtful whether Sheikh Saied would consent to resign quietly from such in apparently strong position, and it seemed probable therefore that if Sheikh Mana and his sup oruers persisted in their claims that fighting would break out in the to vm. 12. In vie n of t;ie nui bers of persons and pro ert^ in Daba^ entitled to British protection and of the impracticability of afordinr it, it was considered that a policy of complete i partiality '/oulcl not be jasti fied and that some action was necessary tc prevent fighting from breaking out. 13. It was considered that the bast method of achieving this object was induce the weaker side to withdraw their claims uy arforc&lt;ine to the stro iger the maximum su^ ort consistent with the jolicy of His Majesty's Csovernirvent. 14. Cypher message 1005/16th (copy attached) was aocordiag3y for/arded to the Political Resiaent on 16th April and identical ' letters (translation attaches) were sent to Sheikh Saied anQ SBj#ikh Man a .n worming them that the whole question had be^n referred to the Political Resident, and warnia^ ta&amp;m to maiiitsuin peace until a reply haa bexi r-^c#i7 id. 13.

'Lupin' v anchored off Sharjah at 0745 on 10th June and the messages contained in your signals a046 /30th May, 223l/2nd and ^0847/4th June, were delivered to the Residency Agent and his Munohi on their arrival on board. 2, The Residency Agent reported that on the occasion of the recent visit of The Honourable, The Political Resident, to the Truoial Coast in a Plying Boat of the Royal Air Force, when the Flying Boat passed over A1 Ajman one of the 3heikh , s servants armed «fith a rifle ran out from the fort and pursued the Plying Boat on a horse, with the apparent intention of firing on her. 3. The Residency Agent wrote to the Sheikh of Ajman requesting him to keep this man in custody until the matter had been referred to the Political Resident, but the Sheikh had not taken any action on this letter. 4» The report of this incident has spread through out the Trucial Coast and considerable interest is being shown as-to what action H.M, Government will take. 5. In view of this, the Residency Agent considers that some action is necessary and is reporting to the Political Resident accordingly. . . 6. H. 11. S. 'Lupin' proceeded to A1 Ajman the same day, with the Residency Agent on board, and the Sheikh of Ajman came on board and was interviewed by Commanding Officer, 7. He disclaimed any responsibility fcr the action of his ser/ant, who is a Persian subject, but agreed to retain him until he heard further from the Residency Agent, and expressed his readiness to carry out the wishes of H.M. Government. 8. He also volunteered the statement that he had no objection to Plying Boats visiting A1 Ajman. 9. The Sheikh of Ajman was saluted with 3 guns on leaving the ship. 10. The Residency Agent also reported that raiding and looting was being carried out with increased intensity THS S8NI0R NAVAL OPPICBR, y &gt; \v PERSIAN GULP.Page 2 of 11 Lupin 'a* letter No. 350/25/13 of 11th June. 1929 . by Bedouin of the Manaair and Awaaer tribes, subjects of Bin Saud, and that it nas now unsafe to travel by land- between Sharjah and Dabai or any of the Trucial Coast- Towns. 11. It is expejctjjjdthat the Truoial Sheikhs, with the exception of Abu^^rtt, who is friendly with the Manasir tribe, will take combined action against these Bedouin after the pearling season. 13. The Residency Agent has received instructions from the Political Resident to send some R.A.P. petrol which has been kept at Sharjah, to Ras al Khaimah. This has bean shipped on board a dhow and will be retained on board her at Ras al Khaimah. 14. The Residency Agent had recently had a visit from the eldest son of the lace Sheikh of Umn al Kaiwain; he complained of being oppressed by the present sheikh, Ahmad bin Rashed. The Residency Agent had written to the sheikh of of Umn al Xaiwain with regard to this. 15. The Residency Agent was landed at Sharjah and H.M.S. 'Lupin' sailed for Basidu at 1300 on 10th June.

From The Mesopotamia Persia Corpn., Ltd., 'Dubai, To The Mesopotamia Persia Corpn., Ltd., Bushire. Dear Sirs, POLITICAL Din^^B^ TCIgS IN DUBA I. We are in receipt of your letter no, 0/286 of 27th ulto., in which you have asked us to give a brief report on the above matter, which we give in the following lines, in de tail. In Dubai there are three Royal families from wliid{i 4 the people choose a Shaikh; the name^of these families are given in a separate paper, and the present ruler, Shaikh Said bin Makdoom is from theip. When tjutx one Shaikh dies the people of Dubai meet in a Hejlis and find out the best man from 'thes three Poyal families and proclaim him as a Shaikh, Also if one Shaikh is found incompetent, the people have a right to depose him. The present ruler shaikh Said bin Makdoon during last six years has become \»¥ry slack and he does inot?; pay proper attention to his duties. His position is further weakened as he is in debt to the extent of nearly Rs. 1,00,000 (one lac). The Shaikh's income per year is about Us. 1,50,000 but he gives out most of his income to Badwins. Also his ex penses are very high. He takes great interest in nogs, camels and horses. But when one goes to him to complain that such and such a man does not pc y money, he promises to take up the case tomorrow and his tomorrow' wi11 never end. Probably several months will pass before he takes ui the case, and we have known several times that when he passes any judgment some Arabs do not listen to him and disobey him. One other complaint ol the Arabs against the pre sunt Shaikh is that if he spends away all the money, how can he defend the town in case of foreign invasion ? They say that the people are getting poorer every year since last six years on account of poor pearl fishing, and as the Shaikh does not administer justice rightly, outsiders like Indians and Persians do not lend them money for small profits. 'he pearl fishing financiers are in great trouble since last five years as the rate of interest is very high, and it is a iact that the pro^x^rity of the town solely depends upon these people. So or. 1 account of such and several other reasons the people of the town are against him, and we understand that eighty per cent, of 'Buflash' tribes is against him from whiQ tribes the royal family ^as descended. « In April last some leading members of the tribe viz., Mohammed bin Ahmed, X h Kssa Thani, Hohmed Thani, Hareb, Abed asti. Shaikh Liana bin Tvashid and so no of Booty bin Sahil held a private meeting and decided that they should do away with Xkx Shaikh Said and make liana Rashid Shaikh.I __ 1 So they sent two men by name Molimed Sani and. Abed Basti to Shaikh r&gt;aid and they carried on coveroiitions wi tli him for six days and finally told him that he (Shaikh Said; should abdicate and accept Liana bin Hashid as Shaikh of Dubsd ^he Shaikh asked for a day's permission to consider over this matter and next day replied that he was prepared to abdicate provided LTana bin Rashid and people of -the town were prepared ^ to pay his debt to the extent of nearly one lac. liana tin Raahid accepted to pay up this debt and the people de clared I,Tana bin Pashid as oliaikh. He put on a sword to show that he was Shaikh and held a Majlis. At this critical moment the Residency Agent arrived at 'Oubai from Shargah by H.A^.S. Lupin and so far we understand that he told Shaikh Said not to abdicate as he promised support of the British Government. The Shaikh at once wrote to Mana bin P.ashid that he will not abdicate and there cane a critical time. On arrival of the Lupin l»ana bin Tteshid went to see the Commander but before he reached the naval boaf Commander had already left for the shore and they met him half way. This shows that Sim ikh liana was Shaikh tl that day. It is customary that Shaikh of Dubai always must go tto see the Commanders of naval boats on arrival at^Dubai and they pay a return visit. Both Mana ana Commander with the Residency Agent went to the house of Shidkh Saia. ^hert the Commander and the Residency Agent had a private meeting with Shaikh Said, and outcome of this visit was that arrange ments were made to turn tables against Shaikh Mana Hashid. The next day tfiae 'Residency Agent had a private meeting with the supporters of Mana Rashid in which meeting the Kesidency Agent told them that the British Government was not in favoui of Mana Rashid and pressed them to accept Shaikh Said as Shaikh. The people and leading Arabs informed him that ^he British Government have no rijfht to interfere in internal affairs according to treaty. C The Residency Agent succeeded by hook or by crook. The 'Buflash' 1 tribe was prepared to li^hu against the Shaikh and they actually took up arms but it was through the intervention of our Government blood shed was avoided. We fafcy mention that most of the people are dissatisfied ana they said that it was not proper that Government should interfere in their internal affairs. We now find that most of the Arabs do not listen to the ohaikh. Indians cind Persians refuse to finance pearl fishers provided they mortgage Borne thing. The rate of interest if now 2b% on mortgage. The widTe of Shaikh Said has mortgaged her property at 2b% for six months and similar is the condition of other Arabs. Our view point is that British Government should not have put hand in internal affairs. The time was not such that such an action was necessary. We could say moch more as i.lie writer is in touch with politics but s:ich a thin^ is not desirable to commit on papers. i d Yours faithfully, SD/ M. D.

I lei t Ban rain in H*M«S*Siiorehaiii at 6*0 p.nu on Saturday the 22nd September* On Sunday at 9 a.m. H.M.S.Shoreham arrived at Doha. As she anchored, Shaikh Hasan the younger son of the Ruler of ^axar came on board. He was accompanied by the Director of Customs, Husain an-Na T mah. He was received at the Gangway by trie Ofiicer of the Day and the S.O.I, who took the son of the Jhaikh to the jay Cabin. After the exchange of compliments Shaikh Hasan said that he had been sent by his father to express his regret for being unable to come on board on account of the pain he nad in his legs and to say that he would like to see us in his Palace at 5.30 Arabic(11.45). Sharbat and col fee were serveo. and then he landed in orcier to inform his father. At 11.30 tne Senior Naval Officer, accompanied by the Doctor ol tlie ship and the S.O.I, and myself landed. The jiiai-tJa received us on the beach and askeo to be excused for not going- to see us on board the ship. After the exchange oi the usual courtesies, coffee and tea were served. After tnis tne Shaikh said that he had prepared a lunch for us and askeo. our permission to bring it. Pood was served in the Arab fashion. Besides the fact that the lunch was excellently cooked the only comment I have to make is that an article of furniture usually exclusively confined to the bathroom was as a dish for curry. The Shaikh seemed in good spirits ana genuinely glad to see us. His sons 'Ali and Hamad were on the pearling banks. After food was served the following is the only conversation of interest which took place between the Shaikh and myself:-''J ^Iis u -2- Shaikh: P.A# Shaikh: S.N.O. Shaikh: Do the Persians still interfere with the sailing biats which ply in the Persian Gulf. Everything is quiet now and they do not interfere with the sailing boats especially when they see the Senior Naval Officer. I hear lot of things about the activities of the Persians and it is true that had it not been for H.M.S.Ships they would have aone lot of trouble. They have imprisoned many of the crew of sailing boats and have also killed some of them. Is 'Abdullah Williamson here at present. He is working on the road from here to Khaur. On Monday the 24th September 1934 at 2 p.m. we reached Abu Musa Island. At 4 p.m. we landed. The Senior Naval Officer and I had a walk across the Island. A lot of red- oxide was found on the north east with dumps of extracted ore in powdered form, loose and in sacks which have rotted^ From the colour of the sand it appears that much of the soil underneath i^ full of the ore. Also copper deposits and salt deposits were seen on the north. There are two fresh springs in the Island, one in the village becomes brackish in the hot weather; the other is inland to the north. Its water is sweet. The population is about 40. The village is situated on the south. A certain amount of fear was noticed among the villagers. They stated that they saw a Persian Sloop which did not stop a month ago. Their attitude to us was friendly. There was no Customs shed. There is a good anchorage close in shore in the south west bay. On Tuesday the 25th September 1934 at 9 a.m. we arrived at Ajman. The Shaikh of Ajman came on board at 9.30 with his younger son and we returned the call at 11.30 at his house. He seemed very pleased to see us. He told us that the ShaiKQ. of Sharjah had visited him and that he had returned the visit a few days ago. I discussed this quarrel with 'Isa-3- who did not think that there would be a lasting truce unless the Shaikh of Sharjah was made responsible for the behaviour of •Abdur Rahman of Hira. He said that 'Abdur Rahman was at the bottom of this trouble and that Ajman would never instigate trouble and that Ajman had his people well in control. This was confirmed by the Shaikh of i^ibai in a later conversation between us. In this connection it might be worth noting a report from 'Fowey' dated the 27th July 1934, to the effect that Bin Ali Shaikh of Khan Gersh was pursuing a policy of separation from Sharjah. He was murdered by a messenger from the Shaikh of Sharjah. Sharjah then imprisoned and shot the messenger after a protest by 'Abdur Rahman. Then Sharjah appointed to Khan Gersh his most powerful brother, Muhammad bin Saqr, and married him to Bin 'Ali's niece. Pleasecsee a previous report to the Under Secretary to the Honourable the Political Resident No.290 datea the 20th June 1934. On the 25th Septmber 1934 at 2 p.m. the Residency Agent joined me at Ajaian and came on board H.K .S.Shoreham to Dibai. From the conversation which I had with him on board I gathered that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi had changed his opinion about the British Government and that he would adopt a oetter ana more friendly attitude towards us in the future if we were to treat him honestly. He said that, in order to show Abu Dhabi that we really intended to carry out our obligations and would treat him honestly in the future we should give him the monthly allowance and back pay which he ana the Shaikh of Dibai have arranged. He thought that when the Shaikh got the allowance he would raise no objection about the emergency landing ground which should be dealt with separately. He is also of opinion that it would be a good thing if I paid a visit to Abu Dhabi soon. In order to be more certain to be about this I decided to discuss the matter with the Shaikh of Dibai* Recently pearling has been bad and whereas before&amp; -4- merchants assisted the Shaiichs of Sharjah and Libai financially they are not prepared to do so now when Sharjah is comparatively wealthy and Dibai no longer poorer than his merchants. The itesidency Agent informed me that the agreement between Has-a1-Khaimah and Rams is that Rams should pay annually Es.lOOO/- to Ras-al-Khaimah and that now owing to an epidemic lasfe' year and bad trade, Rams is too poor to pay» Ras-al- Khaimah refuses to decrease the amount* Rams does not wish to fight owing to the treaty he made but he is writing to protest to trie Political i-tesident# There is a possibility of trouble between them. It might be advisable to order Ras-al- Khaimah to decrease the amount* T* 16 Residency Agent Sharjah wanted to go is with the Shaikh of Dibai to Khamir and was very anxious to take leave for three wee-tcs wnich he said was very necessary for him to re coup his health. He will return in the middle of October. / tie arrived at Dibai at 4 p.m. on the 25tli September 1934. .(hen the ahip anchored the Shaikh and his two brothers, Jum'ah a^d ji-j.jhar,came on board. The Shaikh was received in the Day Cabin. After the usual courtesies, Sharbat and coffee were served. A few: minutes later the Senior Naval Officer called for tea in the dinging room. When the Shaikh left the ship a salute of five guns was accorded to him and one gun to his brother Shaikh Jum'ah. We returned the call of the Shaikh at 5.30 p.m. The Shaikh came to meet us at the Customs Pier and .'- n ^ eti us to ^ Majlis behind his summer house wnich is behind the Customs House. There were a number of packages on the jetty and the Shaikh said that they were all Japanese. Fruits, sweets and coffee were served. The Shaikh and his brothers looker very cneerful all the time and were very friendly. lr v ^After coffee was served I presented the Shaikh with the pair ^ i 0 ^ ^i nocu lars from His Excellency the Viceroy. He expressed | :as fateful tiianks to His Jilxcellency and to the Representatives r ^ 'of H.M.S.Government for the kindness shown to him from time to time, which he hoped would continue for ever. Tib was served-5- kH- s and we bade him farewell. Before leaving I asked the Shaikh if he could come on board with me to Sharjah as J wanted to talis: with him about Abu Dhabi. The Shaikh was very willing to come. Shaikh Jum'ah took us for a walk through the town and on the way we met some Hindu bannias, but did no business with them. The ouaikh's position is not easy as he knows that his cousin Maai' bin Bashid might succeed him in place of his son. I was rather astonished to find that his co u s ins did notjaccompany him on board the sloop and were not present when we returned his call. It is possible that they were on the pearling banks. Tne Shaikh of Dibai expressed his desire for more rifles anu ammuniiion as he had to guard the road to Sharjah and protect his subjects from bedouins. He also said that of the I ten rifles given to him recently, six had to be distributed among the members of his family- he is in the unenvialble position of having to placate his cousins- and he wished to nave a permit for five more rifles. He has been of great ! assistance to us and is not the sort of person to make any trouble and I think his request might be favourably considered On the 26th morning the Shaikh of Dibai came on board and in the presence of the Residency Agent I asked his opinion about Abu Dhabi and Yas A s i and . He said: _ „ ^ j receiTed the orders of the Government J accompanied the Residency Agent to Abu Dhabi in order to settle with the Shaikh about Yas Island. The Shaikh who seemed to have been misled by certain people did not com. to terms. He, however, treats me as feis father anci wnen he saw that I was angry with him, did not like to Qisappoint me. As a result of our efforts and the support which he got from his brothers and Ahmad bin Ehalaf we succeedeo m inducing him to accept the arrangement communicated to you. SnaiKh Shakhbut is a simple and frank person and as such requires f£ -6- 0 some one who knows how to deal with him. He has now changed his opinion about the Government and will adopt a better attitude in the future, provided he is shown that the government intend to fulfil their promise. In my opinion he should be given his back pay and the future allowance so that he may not raise any objection about anything which the Government may ask him about, and I do not think that before this is done he should be addressed about anything. He is a bedouin and unless he is paid according to the arrangement he will be suspicious about the Government and the mischief makers will have their chance. I think that if you were to go there and see him after the payment of the allowance he .ill not have any objection about the emergency landing ground and you will at the same time be able to study him and make him feel more happy. lou should go quickly. At 9.30 a.m. we arrived at Sharjah and the Snaikh came on board. He was accompanied by his brother Muhammad and young son Sa^r. Ihe Senior Naval Officer received him in the Day Babin. Sharbat and coffee were served. When the Snaikh landed he was accorded a salute of three guns. When the Shaikh arrived on board he looked very pale and seemed uneasy but when he found that our visit was merely a friendly one he was more at ease. The Shaikh of Sharjah informed me that on the 23rd night the Manasir looted the house of some Ras -al-Khaimah people in .Sharjah. The Shaikh chased them but did not recover the loot, ihe Shaikh told me that he had just recovered, the loot taken by the Manasir in a previous raid. Before reaciiing Sharjan the Residency Agent informed me tnat the shaikh ol Sharjah would possibly ask for money for the establishment of a |ost Office, fie saia that he was getting a great deal of money for the Rest House ana that as the Post Office would be in the Rest House and would be in the interest of his subjects his demand should be rejected. He also said that he might ask for his salute to be raisedv ' \ V uo to five guns. I replied thatlagreed with him about the Foot v. fiice ana that if the (iuestion of increasing his salute were raised I would tell him that he should be grateful ior the treatment he had r reeeived from the G-ovemment and should not ask for more now* The Shaikh did not mention anything about the salute or the Post Office when I saw him at Sharjah., At 12 a.m. we returned the call of the Shaikh. Fruits, sweets and coffee, were served. After coffee we went to the house of the Residency Agent and then returned to the ship. In the evening I landed and a salute of 11 guns was fired. I went to the Rest House. Two Wapities one of which had had an engine trouble were there. The rifles were inspected by the Officers of the Ro/al Air Force in the presence of the Shaikh. The Shaikh came ^ kauuci to the Rest House to say good bye. After his return he sent a closed envelope to the Head Munshi On asking the messenger about it he said tnat it was an Ikram (present) from the Shaikh. The Head Munshi returned the envelope to the messenger and told him that he was thankful to the bhaikh but that as he was a Government servant he could not accept any present. The messenger took^the envelope to the Shaikh. One'Abdul T Aziz an Egyptian has been practising as a Doctor on the Trucial Coast. The Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi and Dioai turned him out of their territories. He is now at Sharjah. He is not a desirable person and has no diploma. Tiie Residency Agent, Sharjah said that he would try to remove airn Oj asking all the Shaikhs to refuse him entrance to their territories. Transportation by us would be too expensive a^item for our funds. ' e s-H the Shaikhs we met to advise their nakhudhas to fly the Trucial Flag.tl -s- All the ohaLiis whom we met appeared to be genuinely glad to see us and I think that thej will be glad to see us more often than they do now and that visits should be longer in each place for the sake of friendship. I slept at Rest House at Sharjah on Wednesday the 26th ^ reachea Bahrain ea at 9 a.m. on the 27th by the Imperial Airways aeroplane • I must ada a word of thanks and appreciation for the great trouble taken by the Senior Naval Officer to make my stay on uoard comfortable and my tour a success. The obvious friendliness ol all the Shaikhs towards him helped me very much and was undoubtedly responisble for their freindly attitude to me from the beginning. Bahrain, y *— 29th September 1934.

When I did so, he told me that it is true that the Shaikh wishes to get a geologist, mainly in connection with the water supply (l am told, however, that the possibility of oil is at the back of his mino), but that he wi .1 not have a Government geologist. In the circumstances it was useless to proceed with the proposal and I regret that I should have troubled you unnecessarily. 3.

Visit of Anglo-Persian Oil Company T s Geologist to Abu Dhabi. Sir, f ^ L I have the honour to refei^CcT the correspondence ending with your Printed Letter No:965-S dated the 17th October 1954 regarding the proposed visit of a geologist of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited to Abu Dhabi in pursuance of the Shaikh T s request for a geologist to examine the possibility of obtaining an artesian supply of water at Abu Dhabi. 2, ^* : • • ox joined me on board T .M«S Shoreham on the '4th November 1954 and accompanied me on my recent tour. At 1 1 , L } ' ' ,jman, anc umm al Oaiv/ain the Shaikhs beg?ed for him to look for artesian water for them, as soon as they heard that that was his mission to Abu Dhabi. There unfortunately appears to be little or no likelihood Oi ilno'ing rrtesian water at any of these places except Abu Dhabi From Dibai we went some twenty-five miles south-west along the coast to Jabal T Ali (commonly called Jubail), but the hill served only to confirm Mr. Cox* opinion that it was improbable that artesian water would be found unless possibly at a great depth. /4./ 2. 4. From Abu Dhabi v-;e visited by motor dhow a hill some ten or twelve miles north-east of the town - a somewhat cheouered journey, including some hundreds of yards of wading and a night on the dhow stranded by the tide, but productive of great goodwill locally and of information about tribal and other matters which v.ould not have been forthcoming in more formal circumstances. 5. Mr. Cox also went to see certain other small hills near Abu Dhabi. So far, his investigations only enable him to say that the presence of an artesian supply of water is possible, but that it is impossible to offer any definite opinion till he has seen certain other hills some miles in the interior and also certain springs near Ras Dhanna which the Shaikh wishes him to visit. The Shaikh was anxious that ^r. Cox should stay for a few- days and visit these places, but Mr. Cox said that he would need leave from his Company and that he had not got the necessary kit and instruments. He also pointed out that to get definite results he woulc have to do surveying which might easily take up to a couple of months. The Shaikh begged my help and I said that I could, of course, make no promise that the Company would be able to accede to his request, but that I would write to you to ask whether it is possible to arrange for Mr. Cox to pay a longer visit to Abu Dhabi for this purpose. I emphasised that the Company had much work of their own, so that even if they were willing to permit T'r. Cox to pay the visit, it might not be possible for them to do so at once. 6. Mr. Cox also visited Yas Island, Dalmah Island and Halul Island on the way back to Bahrain and found them, I understand, to be geologically of considerable interest.

Unfortunately the Residency Agent and Shaikh Sa ! id bin Maktum of Dibai were ill, so that I could not, as I had hoped, use Kr. Cox 1 visit at the time as a lever towards a settlement of the Tank and landing ground question. 5. In the circumstances I made the most capital that I could out of his visit and that of Dr. Holmes. The change of attitude of the Shaikh was very marked and I hope that our visit may have won him over to a better frame of mind. Fortunately Ivlr. Cox requires to make an examination of certain other places before he can give an opinion - so that we have shown our goodwill, but the Shaikh has yet to receive the b benefit (if any) from our action.

Sir, In continuation of my letter ^o:C/277 dated the 15th December 1934 regarding Mr. Cox* visit to the Trucial Coast, i have the honour to enclose a copy of a note which he has given about the possibility of finding water at Abu Dhabi, Dibai, Sharjah, 'Ajman and Umm al Qaiwain. 2. Briefly, he favours developing the shallow wells of T Ajinan, Dibai and Sharjah by means of windmills or other pum -s, he is doubtful whether anything can be done at Umni al Qaiwain, and he thinks that there is a possibility of obtaining an artesian supply of v/c ter at Abu Dhabi, but that further evidence must be got before a reconmiendation to drill would be justified. 3. The position has been explained to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, who has asked for a further examination to be made. 4. I propose to tell the other Shaikhs of l£r. Cox 1 opinion when I next see them. i should perhaps add that it was thought inadvisable at the time of our visit to do more than warn them that the prospects of finding artesian water were not good, but that it was desirable that ji r. ^ox should see the whole coast /before1°! ■s l e before giving a definite opinion.

Surface formations exposed near the Trucial Coast between Unuri al Qaiwain and Abu Dhabi consist ofi- (1). Recent sands and shelly or coral reef limestones. (2). Poorly consolidated sandstones and sandy or shelly limestones deposited in comparatively recent times but when sea level was some 5-10 feet higher than at present. (3). Underlying strata of lower Miocene or later Tertiary age. The first two groups of sediments lie approximately horizontally and form a belt extending along the coast from Umm al Qaiwain to beyond ^ibai. ^his belt is at least three miles and possibly much more in width. A normal water table is maintained in these rocks at or about sea level, tvidence of wells at Dibai, Sharjah, Al 1 Ajman and Umm al Qaiwain shows that the ground water in these loosely comparted and very porous sediments is of good quality to within one mile or less of the sea coast. This fresh water is probably derived from local rainfall and the line of demarcation between fresh and brackish water appears to fluctuate with seasons. Heavy production from fresh water wells, near this line, would tend to draw back salt water. The total thickness of this surface covering of recent and sub-recent deposits between Umm al Qaiwan•and ^ibai is not known but in Jabal ^li, 20 miles south-west of Dibai, a dome of Lower Miocene beds is exposed in which a thickness of some 500 feet of strata is exposed. Lowest surface elevations, at outcrop, of the uppermost 300 feet of these beds is probably not more than 20 feet above sea level and no spring is known to issue from these exposures. Although it is not known what thickness of beds lies between the Jabal T Ali beds and surface at Dibai and further /north-eastI . north-east, it Is improbable that any such beds should contain water under sufficient head to give artesian flow. Tere there such a water-bearing horizon, natural springs giving flow at surface would be expected at or near Jabal f Ali. If it be assumed that there is no considerable dis- conformity of Tertiary beds beneath the surface at Dibai, Sharjah or Umm al Qaiwain, it must be concluded that the prospect of finding artesian water within at least 500 feet of the surface is extremely remote. To drill for artesian water to a greater depth would, without further information, be a pure speculation. In view of the good water available at very shallow depths (6 feet to 25 feet in veils examined) within the neighbourhood of Dibai, Sharjah and Al T Ajman, installation of wind-mills or other cheap lift pumps would appear to be a sounder means of obtaining a constant supply of water than to drill on the off chance of obtaining an artesian flow of good water. In 'Imm al Qaiwain owing to the sea water lagoon stretching behind the town, it is necessary to go some distance away from the settlement to obtain fresh water in the surface formations. It is probable that a well drilled in this town would find water in Miocene beds beneath the surface cover but whether the water would be of good quality is questionable, rhere the Lower Miocene is exposed in Jabal f Ali, it contains much gypsum and it is probable that any water obtained from this group would be highly gypseous and possibly salty. Abu Dhabi . At Abu Dhabi, as further to the north-east, a surface cover of recent and sub-recent deposits is developed in a coastal belt. 0v;ing to a complex system of inlets of the sea, almost completely surrounding the 'island 11 on which the town stands, water contained in these surface deposits is salt /and Iand brackish. Some twelve miles to the east of Abu Dnabi, chalky limestones, fine grained sandstones and marls heavily impregnated with secondary gypsum, outcrop below the sub-recent and recent beds. These rocks are probably of Miocene or younger age and lie nearly horizontally. T ;ere is little prospect of obtaining good water anywhere in the recent deposits exposed at the surface in Abu Dhabi on account o' 7 ' the smalJ. co-Llecting c.rea and nearness of the sea on all sicies® If the j.nQ0rxyins Pliocene and younger beds there may be fresh water though a fairly high calcium sulphate content would be expected. It is improbable that the water, ii preser .t, would 'e undGi sufficient head to give artesian flow. The evidence of Bahrain shows that Eosene lime stones may carry water over many hundreds of miles trans mitting a head sufficient to give artesian flow to approx imately SO feet above sea level. Should similar conditions prevail in beds of this age as far as Abu nabi, it is possible that wells drilled through the Miocene into Eosene limestones might provide artesian flow. he evidence ii, however, insufficient to justify a recommendation to drill. Further data on the thickness of Miocene beds to be pene trated at Abu Dhabi, might be obtained from a survey of the chain of low hills extending from Jmm Qatara to the coast ^ near Jabal Dhanna. It is also possible, but by no means certain, that such a survey would yield some information regarding the character of the underlying Fosene beds. The nearest floving springs of which we have heard reports are those at Baraka. Examination of this locality may also throw light on water bearing strata which could be expected beneath Abu Dhabi. r ,Confidential GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, D kpaetmint, 1^ EXPRESS LETTER Mc sent by [A 7 - B .—Tkis is an OlilGINAL MESSAGE, sent by pM to save telegraphic expense and undue use of the wires, but intended to he treated, on receipt, with the same expedition an if it had heen telegraphed.

The /oiglo-Persian Oil Company are now, at my request, sending another geologist to continue the survey. The Shaikh is very anxious that his work should be carried out and it will further cement the good relations resulting from Colonel Locl^s recent negotiations on the subject of air facilities. It is of course also important that any geologist visiting the Trucial Coast should belong to a British and not a foreign Company. sd. T.C.Fowle, Lt.-Colonel.

The question would have to be considered on its merits when the time comes, but it is just possible that the Shaikh might be prepared in return for a trial well to give the Company some form of option to explore for oil for a period of time.

It is interesting to see that HajMi 'Abdullah Williamson thinks that Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan has already received some overtures from the Americans, this confirms the fears expressed in my Express Letter ^o:C/149-22/3a dated the 2nd IWarch 1935 and connected correspondence. 3.

Haji Williamson and I returned to ^harjah yesterday afternoon and we leave today by Airways 5 Haji for Bahrain and I for Basra (or Kuwait, if possible). I enclose a brief summary of events at Abu Dhabi during our visit. Please excuse this abominable carbon copy but 1 have not time to re-write or type it. Ha.1i will be able to fill In a lot of detail* Though the main objective I had in view, i.e., to pave the way lor a full survey next winter has not been achieved, the visit has not been entirely a waste of time. We have I think done some thing to cement friendly relations both with the Shaikh and with the people. The main points of the whole business seem to me to be:- (1) The Shaikh and his advisers cannot concieve of the Company (or anyone else) spending considerable sums of money without any prospect of getting something in return. They therefore suspect that there is something behind this readiness to look for water. (2) They know that the Company has paid for the right to explore in Qatar and if there is any exploring to be done in Abu Dhabi they want some ready cash too. (5) Even the prospect of getting a good water supply does not appeal to them as strongly as a cash payment would. We tried throughout to avoid showing undue eagerness but it is very clear that they do not regard our attentions as being primarily altruistic. To continue to pretend that they are would, in my opinion, only increase their suspicions as to our motives. Haji thinks, and i believe it is possible, that they have already received some overtures from the Americans. They are, however, very keen on keeping on the right side of H.M.G. I understand that Shakhbut owes his position largely to your influence in preventing a return of his cousins now in Sharjah. They also believe that if they were to deal openly /withft | : l / IJ i ' ■ Wl 2. with the Americans they might lose your support. One got the impression that Khalifah is the real power in Abu Dhabi and that Shakhbut is c ;uite afraid of both the sons of Saqar in Sharjah and even of his brother, Hazza'. We took quite a lot of trouble to cultivate Khalifah and Haji, I think, achieved it fairly v. ell. These impressions nay be wrong but you, no doubt, will know. By the way I have promised to send Khalifal: some cartridges for a rifle you gave him, a B.S.A .?25 I think. He said that the cartridges he had would not fit it. I should be very much obliged if you would confirm the size of the bore and let me know if any Permit is required for importation through Bahrain. I should have them sent via Kanoo. Many thanks for my Identity Certificate ^hich I have received from Janes. It should save a lot of trouble with the Persian officials. T am sorry I cannot stop in Bahrain on my way back to talk over this Abu Dhabi business. I understand that we shall not reach there until late tonight and though I wired you, do not really expect to see you at the Vlane. I hope you have a very pleasant leave and that we shall meet again when you return.Abu ^habl visit - :,k.rch 6th - 16th. 1935. Wednesday 6th, Arrived Abu Dhabi 5.30 p.m. Called on Shaikh Shakhbut wh4 received us rather coldly. His attitude was that they had had plenty of rain and there was no shortage of water; he did not there fore need anyone to search for water for him. We pointed out that this was only a temporary condition and that, within a few months, things would be as bad as they were before this winter^ rain. We said that the c ompany had regarded his request for a full survey j 2j rupa je Ically but had been unable to send anyone earlier for this purpose owing to pressure of work in Persia; that the Company had sent us now, at some inconvenience to themselves, to dothe best that we could in the short tine available but that it would almost ~ ^ ; ^ j necessary wO carry out the fuller programme before reaching a definite conclusion with regard to drilling for water in /-J u hab tov. r ; that, unti.1 he told us that he did not want to have c ► r ' search or ater, we intended to make a prellmincry tn verse which would greatly help a later survey. We pointed out that since we v/ere then on the spot, it would surely be advisable for us to do ^ could though our time was limited. Tn view of his 6pathetic attitude we did not press the question of a later full survey. He agreed to this without enthusiasm and said he would let us have camels to go eaywhepB whenever we wanted. We said that we should want to trek as far as possible in a S.E direction but, owing to difficulties in making him understand precisely where this would lead to, it was decided that next day we should go to A1 Maqta (7 miles S.E of Abu Phabi) and from there indicate to our guides where else we should like to go. 1 ^After so ie delay canels were produced and we went to A1 1 aqta, returning the same evening. On our return we attended the Majlis of the Shaikh and worked out a programme for a week 's trek: we .vere to go by launch to Suda, near which there were alleged to be perennial springs; from there we were to go by camel to the S as f;■ r as IJ mm Qatand and to return to Abu Dhabi via A1 Maqta. /It wasi s. ■fA qo It was urged that the next day, being Friday, we should remain in Abu Dhabi and give the camels time to reach Suda overland. The atmosphere at this interview was more friendly than on the previous evening but there was still not enthusiasm concerning the search for water. ^ri-iay 3th.. deceived a call from Hazza, brother of ^haikh Shakhbut. Tn the course of about two hours conversation, in which we were asked about the p ompany f s establishment, activities etc., in Persia/!, Hazza said that he knew that the Company had made considerable cash payments to the ^haikh of Qatar for permission to prospect for oil. As far as possible we adopted the attitude that we were concerned solely with the technical side of the Company's work and knew little of its business transactions; we had been sent by the Company at the P..4*3 request to examine the water prospects of Abu Dhabi. Tn the evening we again attended the Shaikh*s Majlis and met Khalifah f uncle of Shakhbut) for the first time on this visit. Arrangements were completed for starting next day and Khalifah expressed his desire to accompany us as far as the launch went. Vi T e welcomed this arrangement. ^turcay 9th. Got away by mid-day. Shakhbut and his brothers came on to the launch to see us off and relations were, generally, most cordial. Satur day - ^ridav 15th . Occupied with launch trip aid 70 mile camel trek which was carried out according to programme. Airing the launch trip we had several conversations with Khalifah who, though very firendly, was throughout sceptical about capacity of anyone to find water in Abu Dhabi by looking at rocks throughout the country. Friday 15th. Returned to Abu Dhabi in evening and informed Shaikh Shakhbut that results of the examination just carried out confirmed previous opinion that (i) that there was little chance of finding artesian water in shallow wells (to about S00 feet depth) and that any water found in such wells would probably be bitter (i.e., containing much gypsum), ^etter and possibly, artesian water /might i| ^ ■ S I ' | 3. it=w3S might be found by deeper boring (to about 1000 feet) but that a full survey of his territory would be advisable before deciding on the expenditure of about 30,000 rupees necessary to drill such a well. We suggested that the Shaikh should write to the c ompany or to the P.A asking that such a survey should be made next winter He replied that the survey itself would be costly and that the Abu Dhabi people could not possibly pay 30,000 rupees for a well even if the results of the survey were favourable. We then suggested, as our personal advice to him, that if he asked for it the Company might conceivably undertake the survey at their own expense in return for being allowed to look for oil in his territory. He, however, returned to his original standpoint that now, after the rains, they were not short of water and he would not write, as we suggested, at any rate at the present. Fe had intended leaving Abu ^habi on Friday night but at the Shaikh's request, we stayed until the next day for celebration of the Id al Dhahir. Saturday 16th . Haji V 'illlamson attended religious ceremonies in connection with the Id and we said good-bye to the Shaikh in the evening. The proposition of his writing a request for a further survey was again discussed but no further progress was made and we sailed for Shar.lah that night.i I ML jq-^o No 116/1935 Dated April 17,1935 jjtom jJae BesiBTencjy Agent, Snarjaa* To iHe Hon f lDle Jol.

Following on certain representations on my behalf to the Shaikh of Ras al Khalmah by the Residency Agent, Sharjah, I have received a letter from the former to the effect that he would be grateful if we could arrange for a geologist from the AngloHr ersian Oil Company to explore oil possibilities in his area. The Shaikh mentions, what we knew already (vide paragraph 21 (1) (b) of Bahrain Intelligence Report No .3 for the period let to 16th February 1936)^ that on the occasion of the visit of the French Warship BOUGAINVILLE to Ras al Khaimah in February last he - the Shaikh - had asked the Admiral for a French geologist to visit his area, and that the Admiral had replied that one might be forthcoming in four months. 2. In view of the Shaikh's preliminary request for 'trench exploration / s. e. mfl'—785s&amp;p—(m-1014)—18-8-33—2,00,000.exploration, and. ol the possibility of rdnerican Oil Concerns interesting themselves in the Trucial Coast, the Shaikh's request now for a British geologist is most satisfactory. It further indicates I hope a definite change of heart on the part of the Shaikh whose conduct - as you are aware - for some years past has been the reverse of satisfactory. There is no doubt that His Majesty's Government's firm attitude in the mat er of their ultimatum to the Shaikh with regard to the Tamb Island flag incident has had a salutary effect. 3. I am writing to the General Manager f Anglo- j ersian Oil Company, Abadan, asking him to be good enough to arrange for a geologist to visit Ras al Khaimah as soon as possible. 4. In my j^xpress Letter No .263-3, dated the 4th Inarch 1936, I reported that an Anglo-Persian Oil Company geologist had visited Abu Dhabi at the request of the Shaikh of that territory. This, followed up by the visit of a geologist of the same Company to Ras al Khaimah, will I trust give the Anglo-} ersian Oil Company the beginnings of a firm footin c on the Trucial Coast should oil ever be discovered there. 6. I am sending a friendly reply to the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah saying that I am approaching the Anglo -Persian Oil Company on his behalf. sd. T.C.Fowle, Lieut.-Colonel.
