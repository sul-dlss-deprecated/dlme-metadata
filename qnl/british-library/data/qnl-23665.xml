No. 11. After Eule 24 of the Government Servants' Conduct Eules the following shall be inserted, namely :— '25. Any function vested by these rules in the Gov ernment of India or in a Local Government shall, in the case of an officer on leave or on duty in the United Kingdom, be discharged by the Secretary of State, and references in these rules to the Govern ment of India or a Local Government shall, in the case of such an officer, be construed accordingly.' [File No. 211-G. of 1926.] 21 : No. 12. Pages 13-16. —The following shall be substituted for paragraph 21. The following are the principles to be observed in the assess- Compensation for land mentl compensation for land required in required for railway pur- British India and in Indian States for railway poses in Indian States purposes * »nd in British India. ■ L I. When land m British territory is required for the pur- Cf. Foreign poses of a railway constructed or to be constructed by aDd PoliticaI or at the expense of an Indian State, such land as is StTon^ m private ownership will be acquired by the British No.493-1, revenue authorities as for a public purpose, under the ullchms provisions of the Land Acquisition Act. The State will be required to pay, as compensation for the land made over to it, the actual amount of the awards paid in the case of private land, and, in the case of Govern ment land, the full market value plus such incidental items of expenditure as the cost of establishment demarcation, stationery. The State will also be re quired to pay compensation for the value of extin guished land revenue, the amount to be settled by2 negotiation in individual cases, due regard being had to the indirect advantages accruing to the British Gov ernment from the railway. Where differences of opinion occur between the State concerned and the local revenue authorities as to the compensation pay able a Board of Arbitration will be appointed consist ing of one member appointed by the State, another by the Government of India (or by the Local Government in the case of a State which is in direct relations with a Local Government), and a third member ap pointed by mutual consent and their decision shall be final. II. Before making an award in the case of private land in British territory to be acquired for a State, or fixing the amount of compensation in the case of Govern ment land, the responsible officer will be required to send all necessary details, together with the estimates of the amounts payable, to the State and to give every facility for checking them to the officer or the officers concerned for the purpose, and to take into considera tion any representation which such officer or any other duly accredited representative of the Darbar may make, whether orally or by letter. Such officers or representatives should be afforded an opportunity of appearing in person or by agent and of producing evidence as to the value of the land before any award relating to it is made or the amount of compensation is fixed. III. When land is required in State territory for the purposes of British railways proper, the general principle to be observed shall be that the same degree of compensation shall be paid to the State concerned as is payable by States under the provisions of the preceding clauses. Where the terms of an existing contract with a Rail way Company provide that the Secretary of State will use his good offices to secure the provision of land in State territory free of cost, the question whether com pensation will be paid or not will be left for negotia tion between the political authorities and the State concerned. Conditions of this nature will be avoided in future contracts. In the case of land originally granted free by a State to a railway being relinquished to that State for its own railway purpose, the railway will have noclaim to compensation in respect of the value of such land. -IV. In order to give effect to these general principles, the following procedure shall be observed :— In cases in which it is proposed to acquire private rights in land in a State for railway purposes, the proceed ings, where the State concerned has enacted a Land Acquisition Act, will be under that law, and the pro visions of clause II will apply mutatis mutandis. Where there is no Land Acquisition Act or where the State itself owns or has rights in the land, which it is proposed to acquire, the estimates of the amount payable will be framed by the State authorities and forwarded to the Bailway Administration concerned, who will be afforded the facilities specified in clause II for checking the estimate. If such estimates are accepted by the Eailway Administration, they will be treated as a settlement. Where, however, differences of opinion occur between the State authorities and the Eailway Administration concerned, as to the compen sation payable, arbitration will take place. If both parties signify in writing their consent to such a course, the Political Officer concerned will be appointed as arbiter and his decision shall be final. In other cases the compensation payable shall be assessed by a Board of Arbitration consisting of one member appointed by the' State, another by the Government of India or the Local Government in the case of a State which is in direct relations with a Local Gov ernment, and a third member appointed by mutual consent, and their decision shall be final. In these latter cases the Board of Arbitration will decide the incidence of the cost of arbitration. 'V. In determining the amount of compensation payable, Political Officers and other arbiters will be guided by the general principle that the amount shall be equi valent to what would have been payable by the State had acquisition taken place in British territory and had compensation been assessed in the manner laid down in clause I supra. VI. When a railway is constructed by a State or States in British territory the State or States concerned will have precisely the same rights as any other EailwayAdministration in British territory* in the matter of. quarrying stone or excavating material required for the purposes of, or in connection with, the railways.! VII- When a Government railway or a railway worked by a Company, or by a State or States, is constructed in State territory, the general principle to be observed will be that such a railway shall enjoy the same rights as regards quarrying stone or excavating material as a railway would be entitled to in British territory ,* the rates of royalty payable being determined in accordance with the rules in force in the State. In cases where there are no such rules, or where the railway authorities consider that the rates under State *N ote .—The practice in British territory in regard to quarrying stone or excavating material required for railway purposes is as follows :— (a) On the standard strip of land ordinarily acquired by a Kailway Admi nistration for permanent occupation, i .e., for the emplacement of th« actual railway, and its appurtenances such as station buildings, platforms, yards, workshops, etc., the question of quarrying rights or payment of royalty does not arise, inasmuch as quarrying as such is impracticable on such land, while material set free in the course of construction is utilised by the railway for its own purposes, free of royalty. For land widths ordinarily acquired for the railway proper (other than at stations and terminals) see Sections VII and VIII and Appendix A oi the Rules for acquisition of land for railways (enclosure to Railway Board's Circular No. 889-P.—16, dated the 30th August 1918). (b) With the exception of the above title to the free use of materials set free in the course of construction on the standard strip of land acquired for the emplacement of the railway, the acquisition of land in general carries with it only the surface rights unless the mineral rights are bought out at the same time under the Land Acquisition (Mines) Act, 1885 (XVIII of 1885). Where surfsce rights only are acquired, a Railway Administration may not quarry stone outside the above standard strip except with the previous consent of the owner, and on payment of royalty where such is ordinarily levied. (c) Mining rights other than those in respect of material met with in course of construction remain with the original owner. Where Government is the original owner, the mining rights are not exercised within a width of 50 yards on either side of the railwaymeasured from the outer toe of bank' or outer edge of cutting. Where the mining rights are in private ownership, the owner cannot extend any mining operations under his control at or to any point within 50 yards of a railway, except with the previous sanction of the Governor-General in Council or some officer authorised by him in that behalf or otherwise than in accordance wdth such instructions, restrictions and conditions, either general or special, which may be attached to such sanction [vide in this connection Section 20 of the Indian Mines Act, 1901 (VIII of 1901)]. (d) When land is acquired definitely for quarrying purposes, dt is open to a Railway Administration to arrange with the owner for securing the whole of the underlying minerals by payment of extra compensa tion therefor, under the provisions of the Land Acquisition (Mines) Act, 1885 (XVIII of 1885). tWorks for the purposes of, or in connection with, a railway are detailed generally in Sections 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 51 of the Indian Railways Act, 1890 (IX of 1890).5 rules are unduly high, resort will be had to arbitration in the manner provided in clause IV above. See note to clause VI. VIII. Where land outside the regular land widths, as pres cribed in Sections VII and VIII and Appendix A in the Eules for the acquisition of land for railways (enclosure to Eailway Board's Circular No. 889-P.— 16, dated 30th August 1918), is required for tempo rary occupation, the procedure in British India will be under Part VI of the L/andi Acquisition Act, and in States in which a law on the same lines is in force, under that law. In cases where there is no such law, the terms of occupation and use will be settled by mutual agreement; and in case of dispute as to the terms, by arbitration in the manner prescribed in clause IV.

No. 13. Pages 24-25. —The following shall be substituted for paragraph 24 :— 24. Establishment, maintenance and working of wireless telegraphs and wire less telephones in Indian Slates. —The following are the principles to be observed in regard to the establishment, maintenance and working of wireless telegraphs and wireless telephones in Indian States :— \. Wireless stations whether owned by a State^or licensed by a State, required solely for communication within a State.- —It is essential, with a view to maintain co-ordination and to avoid mutual interference, that there should be previous consultation with the Government of India in regard to installation and power and before any alterations in location (in the case of fixed sets), type and power -are introduced. For this purpose information* is required as to the following /oints :— (а) the general purpose for which the station is required {e.g., whether it is required for public or private communications, for experi mental or instructional purposes, and whether it is to be fixed or portable, permanent or temporary), (б) the distance over which communication is desired, (c) in the case of a fixed station, the approximate location, i.e., town, vil lage, etc. II. Wireless stations, whether owned by a State or licensed by a State, required for communication with a station in British India. —Such stations can only be erected and worked under special arrangements with the Government of India and the conditions {e.g., in regard to times of working, traffic and rates) will be regulated according to the circumstances of each case. III. Wireless stations, whether owned by a State or licensed by a State, required for communication with a station in another State. —Such stations can only be erected and worked under mutual arrangements effected between the States concerned through the Government of India. IV. The following are the conditions generally applicable to all wireless stations in British India and in Indian States :— {a) Qualified operators should be employed whenever a transmitting set is operated, except in the case of a wireless telehpone set of 30 * Note to Clause I.—After receiving this information the Government of India will, having regard to the location, be in a position to advise in respect of the type of installa tion required and the power necessary, and to allot suitable waves to each station. Unless such advice is obtained and followed there is a risk that stations might be erected in totally unsuitable situations or that the apparatus might be quite inadequate for the purpose in view. In either case the station would probably prove to be a failure. On the other hand, too powerful a station might be erected involving unnecessary expenditure and pro bably causing undesirable interference with other stations. The Indian States will have full scope for choice as regards the type of installations. In respect of wave-lengths and the extent of the power of the sets employed their wishes will be met as far as possible.2 watts or less power. A qualified operator must be in possession of a certificate granted by the Director General of Posts and Telegraphs, India, or by the competent certifying authority in the United Kingdom or in any British possession or protectorate.* (6) Call-signs and wave-lengths are allotted only by the Governmt of India and it is essential that they should be adhered to. (c) It is essential in the interests of wireless communication generally that the States should agree to observe signals of control {e.g., 'suspension of working temporarily', ' adjustment of wave and power,' etc.), when made by Indian Government Stations. Such signals will only be made on the authority of the Director of Wireless. {d) The power employed in a wireless station in an Indian State should be limited to that required adequately to provide the communica tion intended from time to time. (e) In the case of public emergency (see Appendix,' Note 2) it is neces sary for the British Government and the States to work in close co-operation, and the Imperial Government feel confident tha% they may rely on the Indian States to co-operate with them. ' V. Since the responsibility will rest with the States for the working of wireless telegraphs and telephones within their territories, whether worked by the States or under licenses granted by the States, it is desirable that the purely technical terms of the licenses granted by the States should be similar to the terms of the licenses granted in British India. Other terms, of an administrative nature, relating to fees, powers to ins pect, powers to take over, penalties, etc., will be at the discretion of the States. VI. The Government of India are prepared, when desired, to advise on all matters concerning the design, siting and erection of stations. They are pre pared, on payment of cost, if accommodation and staff are available, to train supervising and operating staff and to specify, and order and, if necessary stafE is available, to undertake erection of apparatus and plant. It would be advant ageous both to the Government of India and to States if the Director of Wire less and his Gazetted Officers could be permitted to visit wireless stations in the States, and similar visits to the wireless stations in British India could be arranged for the wireless officers of the States. VII. The principles of this Resolution are liable to revision in the light of subsequent experience. ♦ Note I to Clause IV (a).—The question of Indian States granting certificates is reserved for further consideration. Note II to Clause IV (a).—A qualified operator is essential for the following reasons:— (i) Unless he is technically qualified he will not know whether his apparatus is in correct working order or not, and will not be able to detect or remedy any faults arising from time to time. Technical qualifications are particularly necessary with the complicated apparatus employed now-a-days. (ii) Unless he is qualified in operating duties he will be unable to understand the working of other stations or to operate hie own station correctly, with the result that he will not handle traffic efficiently, if at all and in his efforts to obtain communication he may unknowingly cause great interference to other stations.3 APPENDIX. N ote 1.—The obligations laid on the Government of India by the Inter national Radio-telegraph Convention, which are equally binding both in normal + imes and emergencies, include control of— (а) type of apparatus, (б) power to be used, (c) characteristics of wave emitted, (d) waves to be used, (e) interference, (/) standards of qualification of operators, (ff) operating procedure. N ote 2. —There are strong technical reasons for requiring a stricter degree of control in time of grave public emergency, viz. :— (а) A station might be required as a linking Station between two Stations in British India separated by the State in question and normally out $ range of each other. (б) It might be desirable to organise the Stations of separate but ad jacent States or the Stations of one State into a group to provide telegraph facilities for the Government of India. (c) The control of traffic might be desirable so as to obtain some of the benefits of (a) and (6) without actually working the Stations. (d) Stations might be of great value for intercepting enemy traffic, watch ing for illicit Stations and general intelligence work in time both of internal trouble and of war, which the Government of India might not have foreseen. (e) If a State in which there is unrest desires communication with a Station in British India it may be advantageous to the State to ask the Government of India for assistance in operating the State Station. (/) Protection of Stations in British India and Stations of other States from malicious interference. [Cf.

It is understood that, hitherto such paper has invariably been^/ accepted at its faci ^alue in spite of the considerable difference in some casres in the two values# The Government of India have now decided that, in future, these securities shall be taken at their market value at the time of deposit# 2. ^hen ©hvernment paper is thus offered as security it is not essential that the officer accepting the deposit should require the tender of more Government paper than is sufficient to meet the needs of the case# Since Government paper is issued in round numbers either in hundreds or in multiples of 250, the amount of the Government paper to cover the amount of the security required- should be fixed having regard to the market value at the moment# In the event of such security appreciating or depreciating no readjustment of the value of the Government paper should be made unless the rise or fall of the market value is such as to tender it necessary to call upon the depositor to produce further Government paper to the extent of at leairt Rs.100 or to enable the officer to return to the depositor Government paper to the same extent• diven then no such adjustment should be made unless after such adjustment there is still a reasonable margin between the market value of the Government paper tendered and the amount of the security necessary# 3 a A copy of this letter has been forwarded to the Audit Officer#British Residency &amp; Consulate General, lushire, the January 1927 • A copy of the undermentioned paper is forwarded to the Political Agent, Muscat, the Political Agent, Bahrein, the Political Agent, Kuwait, His Majesty's Consul,for Khuzistan, Ahwaz, His Majesty's Consul, Bandar Ahbas, His Majesty's Consul, Kerman, Sritis'h Vice-Consul, Mohammerahi for information in continuation of this office ondorsement Ho. 3.. dated the 'Hh September 1926. ly order, for ^ecretary to the Political Residert in the Persiar Oulf« Addendum to the Manual of Instructions to officers of the Political Department of the Govern ment of Indiaj 1924, 16* Corrigendum to the Manual of Instructions to officers of the Political Department of the Government of India^ l924^Ho» 17o '7 7^- Cl ar^ tkJ*' a- \ ^ Xr i cit ^h-hV Or Ho. n¥ of 1927.

They have accordingly decided that these orders will apply to all officers of non- Asiatic domicile 'belonging to services or holding posts included in the schedules to the superior Civil Services (Revision of Bay, passage and Pension) Rules 1924 or declared superior under Sections 67-A and 72-2} of the Government of India Act under the administrative control of the Governor General in Council whether serving in areas directly administered 'by theia or elsewhere, The Government of India have also decided that the orders promulgated in this Department letter of the 9th £&amp; July 1926 will come into effect from the date of issue of that letter. A further comunication will 'be mde 'by the finance Department with regard to the adjustment of the expenditure involired.Ho. of 1927* sidency &amp; Consulate General, ishire,the 21st March 1927* To The Political Agent, Muscat.

A* a measure of some economy the Hon*hie the Political Resident directs that certain special code words should be used when telegrams are sent advising despatch of special paclcets and postal hags through the commanders of the mail steamers^ These code words are, however, not to be used when advising despatch of packages containing secret cyphers. In the latter case telegrams should be sent in cypher. The following are the special code words to be used in connection with the mail steamers now plying in the Persian Orulf '^- - Fast liail as. - &amp;lovf Mail AJBB - Vars ova AGO mm Varela m* - Vasna - Vita AGO - Chalcla EHE Barala IS J J - Bandra - Bamora ISLL - Bankura JEW sww m Baroda Barpeta ISJOL m Warina ' U.X4, /» i H L A£2.11® - Please arrange to take delivery on board of one sealed ooyer or packet despatched to you by the Commander of the - —do do-— two sealed covers or packets —do— * ^-do—--do— Three —do-—do—-do—do—do— YYOTf - --do--—do one bag —do— ysrow - —do-—-do-— two bags —do- Thus the first 5 letters of the ten-letter code word denote the number of sealed covers or bags despatched, the next two letters stand for the fast or slow mail, and the last three denote the name of the ship» For examplePlease arrange to take delivery on board of two sealed covers despatched to you by the Commander of the slow mail 'Warina* = 22IPiSSKXX.

Thisfklraedy the practice as regards pay and allowance in respect of officers failing under class id;o Its extension to passages for this class of officers and to passages, pay and alloY/ance for officers of the other two classes* fb; and (c), seems equitable on the grounds- (l) that, for Indian Medical Service officers in citil employ, the^illbank course is part of their training, for which the employing authority assumes responsiblality by enrolov- ing a member of a war- reserve; and ^ ben v fitS 0f the a ^ ditiona - 1 training, whether at Mllbank or ty special study, will accrue to the provinces to which the officers will return. »i'cesf? -2- 5.

At the existing rates, the estimated cost of a first class transport passage has been fixed at £ 43-0-0 per berth, and a charge at this rate will be made whenever transport berths are allotted to officers in Civil employ♦ 6o Aq the matter is urgent and early effect has to be given to the scheme, I am to request that the Government of India may be favoured with the views of the local Government on the proposal outlined in the preceding pragraphs, at a very early date©PRESS comruinaua ♦ Dated 21st April 1927* The Beeretary of State for India has decided that all officers appointed in India to the Indian Medical Service are to be deputed to England to take the Junior Royal Army Medical Corps course within the first year of their service. All Officers of the Indian Medical Service, including those of Asiatic domicile, will also be required, before promotion to th* rank of Hajor and between the 7th and 10th year of th%r service, to complete the Senior Officers 1 course at the Royal Army MedicalCollege, Millbank. Attendance at both these courses will be regarded as duty and will carry with it a free passage to and from the United Kingdom* Officers of the Indian Medical Service of Asiatic domicile, whether in military or civil employ, immediately after cop-oleting the Senior officers' course at Millbank, will be regarded as eligible for a period of study leave, during which tjiey will retain a lien on their free return px passage to India* If the exigencies of the service make it necessary in any particular case to refuse an application for such study leave, the Officer in question will subse- auently be eligible for a free passage between India and the United Kingdom on one occasion during /his service for the purpose of taking study leave* The leave then taken may be combined with any other form of leave but a free passage will only be granted to those officers who had applied for, and been refused, study leave on conclusion of the senior officers* course; and the concession of a free passage v/ill not be extended to members of their family* Those^officers now in service, who, by reason of their age, are disqulmed ^ from attending the senior officers* course, will also be eligi ble on the same conditions for one free passage to england and back when proceeding on study leave* ^or financial reasons it has been impossible to give full effect to the above scheme this year; but it is hoped to make the necessary provision in next yearsbudget* In the meanwhile the Government of India have decided that any oxficer Ox he Indian Medical Service of Asiatic domicile, who is already tocold to attend the senior Officers' course at Millbank are who is likely to attain the rank of Major bexore the scheme can be brought into force, will be regarded aa eligx- ble for one free iixxxscga: return passage to the united Jiingdom when granted study leave*Ho. 2117 of 1927* British Residency &amp; Consulate -General, Bushire, the 29th September, 1927» is / A copy of the findermentioned paper/s axs forward ed to 8 The Political %ent t Muscat, The Political Agent, Bahrain, The Political Agent, Kuwait, His Majesty's Qonsul, Bundar Ahhas, His Majesty's Consul for H:huzistan,iUii5a2 f His Majesty's Consul, Kerman, British Vice-Consul, Moh^-inmerah, for information* By order for Additions and corrections to the Fundamental Rulet Uo* 33, 38, 99, 100 and 101. tC^ OM 'till 0 Secretary to the Political Pwesi^fent in the Persian Gulf,for infonaatioiu ft&gt;i Ho. 2141-17/29 of 1927.

S ubject :— Admission of Government servants to the Auxiliary and Territorial Forces. Sib, In accordance with the recommendations of the Auxiliary and Territorial forces Committee, which have received the approval of the Spcretarv of State for India in Council it has been decided that Government servants shall not be commissioned or enrolled or continue to serve in the Auxiliary Force (India) or the Indian Territorial Force, without the written permission of the Local Government or Administration or the Head of the Department in the case ot Government servants who are not serving under a Local Government or Administration. A 2. A Local Government or Administration or a Head of a Department m granting such permission should realise that enrolment or appointment to the two lorces imposes, inter alia, a legal obligation in regard to training, embodi ment and military service as laid down in the Acts and Rules governing those orces. This written permission involves therefore the acceptance of the fact that when the recipients are called up for training or service, military orders aI ? P ara ™ 01111 ^ and at that stage the employer will not be consulted as to whether he can or cannot spare the services of his em] loyee. 3. Under Sections 18 and 19 of the Auxiliary Porce Act the Auxiliary torce (India) is only liable to be called up or embodied for military service withm strictly defined local areas and Section 20 of that Act lavs upon the military authorities the obligation to replace units of the Auxiliary Force (India) so called out or embodied, by regular troops or otherwise as soon as cir cumstances permit. t uA units of the Indian Territorial Force, when formed, will be liable to obligations similar to those of the Auxiliary Force (India). F n f er ® ec ^i 0Ils ^ 10 of the Indian Territorial Force Act provincial units of the Indian Territorial Force are liable to perform military service at any place within, or in special circumstances, beyond the limits of India. 6. Except in rare cases, it will probably be found to be inexpedient to grant permission to Government servants to serve in provincial units of the Indian lerntonal Force, but as units of the Auxiliary Force (India) and urban units of the Indian Territorial Force are only liable for local service, the Government ot India hope that Local Governments and Administrations may una it possible to grant permission to Government servants to join such units.o 2 '7.

Difficulty is especially encountered in the case of a man who, holding a license of one of the Indian Colleges of hyslolans or of a State Medical Faculty, or being a Sub-Assistant Surgeon, desires to obtain two years clinical study in a hospital to qualify for the Conjoint Board Jixamlna- tion, and it may be taken for granted that in other than exceptional cases, such facilities will not be granted by the Medical Schools in London.

It may be observed that it will only be possible to employ, in the manner indicated, a very few civil servants, as the total number of the Army in India Reserve of Officers who can be^ so employed is only 26. 3. As regards those of their own employees who have already joined the Army in India Reserve of Officers, or who may hereafter do so, the Government of India have consented to their participating in the' scheme under the conditions stated, and I am to enquire whether the Local A^Xfaation wil1 similarly permit their employees to participate in this scheme. The Government of India consider that by including Government servants in the scheme future mobilization arrange ments will be considerably facilitated. I am. S ir, Your most obedient servant, (Sd.)

Subject.— Employment of officers of the Army in India Reserve of Officers, other than Government servants, on part-time military duty in peace time. T am directed to say that the Government of India have had under considera tion the question of the employment of officers of the Army in India Reserve of Officers, other than Government servants, on part-time military duty in peace time for certain special purposes. The conclusions arrived at are stated in the following paragraphs of this letter. 2. In order to facilitate the peace time preparations necessary for the enrol ment, on mobilisation, of technical and other personnel (both British and Indian) for whom military experience is not essential, it has been decided— (i) That officers of the Army in India Reserve of Officers, possessing the necessary commercial connections or other appropriate qualifications and willing to undertake the work, may be employed on part-time military duty on behalf of General Officers Commanding-in-Chief, Commands, and the General Officer Commanding the Burma District under the provisions of Army Regulations, India, Volume II, Appen dix XXX, paragraph 15. This duty will consist of formulat ing schemes for the provision of personnel required on mobilization in accordance with requirements notified to the selected officers by a Command Headquarters or by the Burma District Headquarters. Such schemes will indicate the sources of supply from which the various categories are likely to be obtainable on mobilisation, and the measures required on mobilisation to make the schemes operative. (ii) That part-time duty of the nature indicated above, carried out inter mittently throughout the year will, to such extent as may be assessed by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Command, or the General Officer Commanding the Burma District, be reckoned as the equivalent of a period of continuous military training carried out under the regulations in force at the time for the Army in India Reserve of Officers, and will entitle the officer concerned to the emoluments admissible under the Regulations for the Army in India Reserve of Officers for such a period of training. If the period as assessed is less than the maximum period of training admissible actual military training may be carried out if required for the remainder of the maximum period. (m) That the authority for the issue of emoluments for such ^ork will be a Command or Burma District Order in the following terms :— ' Captain , Army in India Reserve of Officers, performed part time military duty during the financial year 19 19 equivalent to a period of days training with regular troops. He is entitled under Army Department letter No. A.-35528-1 (A. G. 2), dated 13th March 1926, to the emoluments admissible in respect of such a period of training.' (w) That the period of such employment as assessed under clause (ii) pre ceding may not exceed the total period of training admissible under the regulations in force at the time for the Army in India Reserve of Officers. (-y) That officers of the Army in India Reserve of Officers so employed may be borne on any list or category of the Army in India Reserve of Officers. (vi) That the number of officers of the Army in India Reserve of Officers to be employed under the terms of this letter shall not exceed six per Command and two in the Burma District.'No. A.-35528/2-(A.

To A ll LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND ADMINISTRATIONS. Subject :— Admission of Government servants to the Auxiliary and. Territonal Forces. Sir, From infonnation received since the issue of Army Department letter No. A-38847/1 (A. G., A. T. F.), dated the 21st November 1927, it appears that doubts exist in some quarters as to the extent to which Government servants should be allowed to serve in the Auxiliary Force (India). 2. That letter set forth generally the legal position of those who join the force and drew attention to certain liabilities that are ordinarily attached to enrolment or appointment to it: but it is not, and never has been, the intention of the Govern ment of India to embody any Government or railway servants whose retention m their normal appointments and duties is essential or obviously more useful to the State than their retention in military employ with the Auxiliary Force (India). 3. His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief fully appreciates the value to the Auxiliary Force of the presence in it of influential civil officers, and he considers that anything in the nature of their general withdrawal would be most unfortunate. Moreover Section 13 of the Auxiliary Force Act, 1920 and rule 11 (t) c of the rules made under Section 30 provide ample discretionary powers ; and His Excellency feels sure that the fulfilment of the ' military obligations imposed by the Act can be satisfactorily settled under these provisions by mutual agreement between the civil &amp; military authorities concerned.

India Office letter No. M.-1135/29, dated the 15th March 1929. 2 Eor passages booked under Appendix A to Passage Regulations, India, 1928, the Government of India have decided that the orders of the Secretary of State regarding the maximum amount admissible for expenditure by concession passengers in connexion with return passages between India and Great Britain, will have effect from the 1st September 1929. In cases in which audit officers have authorised the booking of single parages before that date, no recovery of the excess amounts authorised will be errectea.

GARDNER, Offg. Assistant Secretary toCopt op Army Department letter No. 271-5-Q.-2 (A. D.-2), dated the 31st January 1929, to the Secretary, Military Department, India Oppice. Maximum admissible for expenditure by concession passengers in connection with return passages between India and the United Kingdom. The exact intention of paragraph 1 of your letter No. M.-2078—1928, dated the 4fch May 1928, is not clearly understood, and the word ' impracticable ' used in the concluding sentence of that paragraph appears to require elucida tion. 2. In the interests of officers themselves, a restriction has already been imposed on the frequency of the use of passage concessions, see paragraph 4 of Part III of Appendix II to Army Instruction (India) No. 5-S. of 1925. To add further restriction requiring officers to book return passages, as a general rule, would appear to interfere with the right to choose the line of steamers by which they travel which they possess under note 1 to paragraph 4 of Part I of appendix II to the passage rules. For example, an officer might desire to spend a portion of his leave on the Continent. He might book a single passage by Lloyd Triestino, spend some time on the Continent and then proceed to England to complete the balance of his leave, in which case he would normally book a return passage from England to India direct by some other line of steamers. This booking of two single passages would not be in accordance with the views expressed in your letter referred to, even though the cost of the two single passages might not exceed the cost of a return passage between Bombay and London by P. and O. 1st Class ' B 3. The Government of India would be glad to know whether it is the inten tion that in future officers must, as a general rule, engage return passages on all occasions when it is known that they are returning to India. Information is also requested as to what is to be understood by the expression ' clearly im practicable When an officer knows that in the ordinary course he will re turn to India, it would always be practicable for him to book a return passage unless he is allotted a transport passage as an invalid. On the other hand, the expression might be held to have particular reference to the places in which the officer desires to spend his leave as in the example quoted in paragraph 2 above. 4. As it is desired to issue definite orders with as little delay as possible, the favour of a very early reply is requested. Copy op India Oppice letter to the Secretary to the Government cf India, Army Department, No. M.-1135/29, dated the 16th March 1929. Maximum admissible lor rxpenditure by concession passengers in connection with return passages between India and the United Kingdom, With reference to your letter of the 31st January, No. 271-5-Q.-2 (A. D.-2), on the above subject, I am directed by the Secretary of State in Council to inform you that it was not the intention to suggest that any restriction should be placed on the right of officers to select the line of steamers by which they should avail themselves of passages under the provisions of Army Instruction (India) No. 5-S. of 1925, nor to require them to take return tickets if they pre ferred to travel by two different lines. It is, however, considered that in normal cases where an officer is travelling from and to India, or any other Station, within the period of availability of a return ticket, the total expenditure ad missible should be restricted to the maximum of the 1st Class ' B ' P. &amp; O. return fare by the all-sea route for the double journey, and that he should not, in such circumstances, be permitted to utilise from his passage account themaxinrnm cost of tvro single passages. In cases, however, which necessarily involve his returning by a different route, e.^r., an officer posted from Iraq to India^ or from India to Burma, whilst on leave, it is not proposed to impose such conditions, hut to provide him with a certificate for the maximum ad missible for a single passage irrespective of the cost of his homeward journey. Copy or Akmy Department letter to the Secretary, Military De partment, India Oppice , No. 271/2 (Q. M. G.-2), dated the 15th March 1928. Overland journeys to, from or via Iraq. With reference to paragraph 3 of your letter No. M. N.-24424)/33, dated the 4th January 1928,1 am directed to say that the limitation of expenditure for sea journeys between India and England when single tickets are booked each way is not restricted to £147 when credit in the passage account concerned is in excess of that amount. 2. The same procedure is adopted with regard to the civil rules in accordance with the note 5 below paragraph 1 of the ' Rules for the Account ing and Auditing of the Passage Concessions '. The following is the relevant extract ;— ' .... Thus, in case an officer chooses to travel on single tickets both homeward and back he will not be allowed any benefit in excess- of the cost of a return passage by P. &amp; O. 1st class B if the only amount at his credit in the Personal Passage Accounts is the cost of one return passage by P. an d O. 1st class B.' 3. The Government of India consider that the position should be made clear in the actual rules issued with Army Instruction (India) No. 5-S. of 1925 and, if the Secretary of State approves, a second clause will be added to paragraph 4 (» of Appendix I to that Army Instruction (India), embodying the provisions of the extract given in paragraph 2 above. Copy op India Oppice letter to the Secretary to the Government op India, Army Department, No. M. -2078/1928, dated the 4 th May 1928. Maximum admissible for expenditure hy concession passengers in connection with return passages between India and the United Kingdom. With reference to your letter dated the 15th March 1928, No. 271/2 (Q. M. G.-2), I am directed by the Secretary of State in Council to inform you that, apart from the fact that the benefits admissible to officers and their families under Army Instruction (India) No. 5-S. of 1925 are assessed in terms of return passages, he considers it desirable in the interests of the officers themselves that, as far as possible, the booking of single passages should be discouraged. He is therefore of opinion that in normal circumstances, i.e.y when the return journey is expected to be performed within the period of validity of a return ticket, the maximum admissible for expenditure by con cession passengers on a journey from India to the United Kingdom and back should be restricted to £147, whether the passage is performed on a return ticket or by means of two single bookings. Special cases in which the purchase of a return ticket was clearly impracticable would be considered on their merits, and a certificate authorising expenditure up to £84 on the outward journey would be issued where the facts were held to justify this course. Under this interpretation of the rules, the position of officers and their families proceeding from or to India by sea as concession passengers would be similar to that of concession passengers proceeding from or via Iraq {vide this Department's letter dated the 4th January 1928, No. M. N.-24424/33). I am to add that no amendment of A. I. (I.) No. 5-S, of 1925 is considered to be necessary.

While most , if not all. Officers in India have to pass departmental examinations in the appropriate vernacular, only a few of them continue their linguistic studies heyond this stage, Generally, they content them selves with their ability to get through their work with the knowledge already acquired, as prjzfaotice enables them to tsrs converse easily on certain limited subjects. This is only to be expected, as, once past their departmental ex aminations, Officers have work to do which occupies their energies fully, so that leisure in India is profitably x spent dn games, shikar, or ether forms of relaxation. The situation is different,however, when an officer is onilong leave, and I believe many would welcome the opportunity of pursuing further studies of the vernacular if they only knew that such study would be possible at the School of Oriental Studies. % experience of the rate students that do come for such ^refresher** courses con vinces me that the ordinary Officer does not know that teaching is given here beyond that is required for the probationer going out to India, frequently we have had students who come about the end of their leave, havinghaving only then heard of the School(s existence, and who explain that they would have come for a longer course if they had had previous knowledge of the in struction that could he obtained. The importance of improving the Imowledge of the vernacular needs nc emphasising on my part, and it is wrong that any means of further study should he missed on account of the ignorance of the facilities available.

I am directed to refer to your letter dated the 23rd April 1930, to the Private Secretary to His Excellency the Viceroy, with which you forwarded a representation dated the 22nd April 1930, from the All India Association of European Government Servants on the subject mentioned above. The Association have urged the reconsideration of the orders conveyed in this Department letter No.l654-H., dated t'he 24th August 1929, which were to the effect that officers of non- Asiatic domicile belonging to the Superior Civil Services in India, who are entitled under the orders passed by the Government of India on the recommendation contained in gaxsgx paragraph 93(cj of the Report of the Royal Commission on the Superior Civil Services in India to recover from Government the cost of medical, surgical or nursing treatment, if they undergo it in hospital, must defray such expenditure them- -selves when it is incurred at their residence owing to the absence of a G-oyernment or non-Government hospitals. 2. The Association admit that the or ders passed by the Government of India in their letter of the 24th August referred to above are in strict accordance with the Commission'^ recommendation, but they argup that they do not accord with the intention underlying the recommendation. The Government of India are unable to accept this view, for it is, in their opinion, clear that whilst the Commission desired that officers of the Superior Civil Services should be ensured medical treatment of the character to which they had been accustomed in thein the past, they had no intention of suggesting the grant of any additional concessions except in regard to services, whethei surgical, medical or sursing, rendered in Hospitals and to otnei matters mentioned insub-rparagraphs (a) ana (c) of paragraph 93 of their Report. In pursuance of their recommendations the Government of India decided (a) that non-Asiatic officers of the Superior Civil Services and members of their families are entitled in certain conditions to travel at Government expense^ to the nearest station to consult a British medical officer, if no such officer is stationed at their headquarters; and that if the patient is too ill to travel, travelling allowance w^uld be granted to the nearest British medical officer from and.to his headquarters for performing a journey to attend the patient; (b) that subject to certain conditions, if^the meidcal officer first consulted considers the case of such an officer or a member of his family to be of such a serious or special nature that he is unable to treat it, the patient may travel at Government expense to the nearest station where adequate treat- -ment is available and if the patient is not fit to travel, travelling allowance will be granted to a specialist for making the journey to attend the patient. These concessions are embodied in Supplementary Rules 155-A and 155-B. These orders, it should be explained, apply directly only to officers who are subject to the Fundamental Rules and are under the administratis control of the Governor General in Council, but local Government will no doubt adopt them in dealing with their own officers, if they }iave not already done so. 3. The Commission must have been well aware of the fact that in many places at which officers of the Superior Civil Services are stationed no facilities exist for their treatment, but they did not recommend that officers who are not in a position to avail themselves of such facilities should be grant- -ed any kind of concession compensating them for their absence. The Government of India do not consider that adequate justifica- -tion exists for going beyond the recommendations made by the Commission. They realise that officers situated in small stations are at a disadvantage in respect of medical treatment as compared0 t -€&gt; as compared with officers stationed in larger stations in which there are hospitals. There is, however, no practical remedy for this and it must be regarded as one of the incidents of service. The Government of India regret that in the circums- -tances stated they are unahle to modify the orders contained in this Lfpartment' letter No.l654-H., dated the 24th August 1929. - -X-K-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-2 2./ Copj of a letter dated the 23rd April 1930, from the Honorary Secretary, Bengal European Government Servants Association, Calcutta, to the Private Secretary to His S xeesx Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General of India, Simla.

From The Honorary Secretary, All-India European Government Servants Association. To ' ' ; : His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General of Indis My Lord, I am directed 'by the Council of my Association to x . invite your Lordship T s attention to paragraph 93(e) of the Report of the Royal. Commission on the Superior Civil Services 'v. in India, dated March 27, 1924. Ir that paragraph the Royal Commission recommend 'that officers should be entitled to free medical attendance as at present. If treated in hospital, they should not he liable for payment of medical, surgical and nursing charges, but charges for board or special accommodation should be defrayed by the officers themselves. Normal fees should be chargeable for their wives and families. 2. In their letter No.l43/V-311, dated February 13, 1928 copy appended, the Government of the Unjted Provices have staix stated that the Government of India have decided to give effect to the above recommendation of the Royal Commission. The Government of India, however, in their letter No.l654~H, dated August 24 1929, to the Accountant General, Central Revenues, cf which an extract is appended, have decided 'that British -Officers belonging to the Superior Civil Services in India are not entitled to recover from Government medical, surgical or nursing charges when they incur such expenditure at their residence owing to the absence of a Government of non-Governmenl hospital'. 3. My Association appreciate the value of the acceptance by the Government of India of the recommendation of the Royal Commission, and understand that the orders contained in the extract from the Government of Indian letter No. 1654-Health dated August 24, 1929, are in strict accordance with the letter of that recommendation. But my Association desire to pointpoint out that the effect of the Government of India T s igtisKX decision is that officers who are stationed in places where there is no Government or non-Government hospital are less generously treated than officers in larger stations. Should they at any time fall so seriously ill as to he unahle to be moved to a hospital in another station without danger, they have to incur expenditure on account of medical, surgical and nursing charges, which superior service officers in stations furnished with a hospital ita; do not have to incur. Iwy Association venture to suggest that the decision is not in accordance with the intention of the recommendatijn of the Royal Commission, that it is unfair, and that it tends to encourage officers to seek to aT?oid service in smaller stations where hospital asssaix accommodation is not available. 4. Puther, my Association learn that in cases where, for any reason, such as the danger of moving the patient, the m unsuitability of the hospital accommodation or the lack of any, a superior service officer is, under the orders of his official medical adviser, treated at his own home, he is likewise unable to recover expenditure incurred on medical, surgical and nursing charges, which expenditure he would have been able to recover had he been moved to a hospital. The unfairness of this order in the case of a patient who is unable to be moved on account of the suddenness, violence, or peculiear nature of his illness must be clear. The graver the illness, the more critical the patient T s state, the less likely is he, under existing orders, to be entitled to assistance towards meeting the expenditure incurred. 5. My Association, therefore, would respectfully urge upon your Lordship the desirability of a reconsideration of the Government of India orders contained in the extract from letter No.l654-Health of August 24, 1929, quoted in paragraph 2 of this letter, and request that the Government may, in modification of their previous decision, issue an order to the effect that, in cases where the Civil Surgeon or other official medical attendant on an officer of the superior service certifies that the removal of the patient to a hospital is impossible or inexpedient»■» * ■ * ■2^ inexpedient, the officer shall be entitled to recover the expenditure incurred on medical, surgical ana nursing cuarges It is recognised tiiat some definite scale of fees to cover the operation of such charges would have to be laid down or alternatively an officer such as the Surgeon-General to Government be declared iaax as the officer who should moderate such charges in the interests of Govenment and whose decision should be final. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd* A.T. Weston, Honorary Secretary.Copy of a letter No.l43/Y-311 ? dated Allahabad, the 13th February 1928, from the Secretary to Government, United Provinces, to All Heads of Departments, etcl, etc.. United Provinces. I am directed to say that the Government of India have decided to give effect from July 9, 1926, to the recommendation made in paragraph 93(e) of the report of the Commission on the superior services in India that British Officers in addition to receiving the free medical attendance to which they are at present entitled, should, if treated in hospital, also receive^ medical, surgical and nursing attendace free of payment. It has also been decided that in a station where, owing to there being no Government hospital, an officer is, on the advice of a responsible medical officer, removed to a non-Government hospitsl for treatment, such medical, surgical and nursing charges, as are ordinarily realised by the institution from a patient, will be defrayed on his behalf by the Government under whom the oiiicer is serving. 2. These orders will apply to all officers of non-Asiatic domicile belonging to services or holding posts included in the schedules to the Superior Civil Services (Revision of Pay, Passage and Pension) Rules, 1924, or declared Superior under Section 67-A and 72-1) of the Government of India Act. 3. The control of the expenditure involved in consequence of these orders will rest with the Heads of the departments to, which the officers, on whose account the charges are incurred, belong. The expenditure will be debitable to ''Allowances' in the departmental heads of account, and will be classified as votable or non-votable according as the pay of the officer khhx concerned is vo table slkh or non-votab-le. I am to request that Heads of Departments should made the necessary provision accordingly when framing their budget estimates in future. 4. The Governor, acting with his Ministers, desires that fhese instructions may be brought to the notice of all British member® of the All -India Services, as defined in paragraph 2.(Extract from letter No.l654-Kealtli, dated August 24, 1929, from the G-overment of India, Department of Education, Health and Lands, to the Accountant-General, Central Revenues).

Question of improving banking facilities in the Hejaz for Indian pilgrims. Sir,. with reference to paragraphs 23 and 24 of meiamorandum A$ a copy of which was received with your memorandum no. 1889/1956/1, dated the 18th July, 1931, regarding paragraph 14 of the Haj Inquiry Committee^ Confidential Report, I am directed to say that the Govt, of India have considered the proposals made by you for the improvement of banking facilities in the Hejaz for Indian pilgrims, but consider that there is no action which they can suitably take in the matter 4keMee&amp;ves v -whe9efts^4^ ie-»e-i4l£eiik««4 at present, if Indian banks would profit from opening up business in the Hejaz, they may be expected to move in the matter themselves, whereas if there is no likelihood of their doing so, the Government of India by suggesting to a particular bank or banks that they should undertake such business would be courting an application from them for remuneration or compensation of some sort in the event of losses being incurred. It is obvious that it would be impossible to entertain any application of this character. 2. With reference to the other matters mentioned in the memorandum, attentiozn is invited to the remarks made in the paragraphs entitled 1 •Banking facilities 11 and Currecy in the Hejaz 1 * at page 5 of the 1 'Guide for Pilgrims to the Hejaz 11 , a copy of which was forwarded to you with this Department letter Ho.69 H(a), dated the 14th January 1932.

Treatment of British Officers of the Superior Qivll Services in military hospitals. Sir, With reference to your letter Ho.811/116, dated the 22nd February, 1932, I am directed to say that the G-overn- ment of India have decided that, for the purpose of the orders contained in their letter H0.996-H., dated the 9th July, 1926, military hospitals should 'be regarded as Government hospitals, provided that accomodation is avail able in them for civil officers at the time that an officer 1 admission to them is sought. In accordance with this de cision, to entitle a British Officer of the Superior OivU Services who is treated in a non-Government hospital at a place where there is no Government hospital except a mili tary hospital, to reimbursement of medical, surgical and nursing charges under paragraph 2 of this Department letter Ho.996-H-. dated the 9t'h July, 1926, he should produce a certificate from his official medical attendant to the ef fect that no accomodation ms available for him in the military hospital at the station. 2.It is not clear from your letter whether Mr.M .v. Laurie, I..?.S., Assistant Silviculturise, fulfils the above condition. But as he was admitted ihto the Coronation Hospital Dehra Dan, on the recommendation of the Oivil Surgeon, the Government of India agree as a special case, that the recovery of Hs.4l/4/- from him on account of his treatment in that hospital may 'be waived.

Grant of free medical treatment to Government officers and establishments. Sir, l am directed to refer to your letter Ko.525-G dated the &amp;th -March, 1929, on the subject noted above. The delay in replying to the letter has been due to the fact that certain connected questions were separately under the consideration of the Governemt of India. 2. The points on which the ruling of the Government of India was sought in the letter referred to above are the following:- U) Whether British officers of the Superior Civil Services are entitled to free electrical treatment in hospital and whether they should or should not be made to pay for X-ray examinations; (2j Whether such officers should be required to pay for medicines actually required, and used, for Jtheir treatment if such medicines do not happen to be stocked in the hospital; and (3) Whether Government clerks are entitled to free surgical and electrical treatment and nursing when treated in hospital, 3* Point (1 j . The Principle which the Governiaent of India have adopted as to the extent of the hospital treatment concessions admissible under this Department letter&gt;*■11 -2- No.996-H, dated the 9tii July, 1926, to an officer serving under them isthat an entitled officer may be given, free of charge, whether as an in or out patient, in a hospital to which he may be admitted in accordance with the orders contained in the lette^ referred to above, only such medical, surgical and special treatment as the hospital proviues with its own staff, or equipmeiit and apparatus in the ordianry course of its work. In the light of the above decision, a British officer of the Superior Civil Services will be entitled to free electrical treatment and X-ray examination in hospital only if facilities fpr such treatment and estaminauion are available in the hospital and if the authorised medical attendant of the patient recoiijne- nds it. 4. As regards point (2), I am to refer you to the orders conveyed in paragraph 3 of the Government of India, Education, health and -^ands Department letter ifo.260 Health, dated the l u th Pebruaru, 1932, to the Government of Assam (copy enclosed). 5. So far as point (3) is concerned. Government clerks are entitled to free medical attendance and medicines for them selves under the Government of India, Home Department Resolu tion No.14/447-64, dated the 25th October 1884, which is still in force. Medical attendance has, however, not been defined so far and the Government of -i-ndia have now decided with refe rence to the actual practive obtaining at present that this term should include. (a) Medical attendance at the entitled Government servants residence or at the consulting rooms of the authorised medical attendant including such surgical treatment as can suitably be given at the Government servants residence or at the consulting rooms of the authorised medical attendant. (b) Ihen the authorised medical attendant considers it desirable in the interests of the patient that he should be sent to a Government hospital to which he is entitled to be admitted the Government servant will receive such treatment ordinary and special as is normally provided by the Hospital with itsown staff, equipment and apparatus. Treatment with such drugs sera, vaccines etc. as are ordinarily available in the Hospital for the use of patients will be given hy the hospital, free of charge, Government clcJcks are thus entitled to free surgical and electrical treatment in hospital if available in the hospital. They are, however, not entitled to free nursing, as taat con- session has been granted only in the case of officers of non« Asiatic domicile belonging to the Superior Civil Services in India.

Questions relating to medical treatment of British Officers of the Superior Civil Services Sir, I am directed to refer to your letter tio.lM 1967-M dated the 23rd ^une, 1931, in which the Government of Assam have reviewed the question of the free suppl of vaccines and medicin to Government officers, and enquired whether the Goverm^ent of India concur in the general principles which the local Govt, propose to prescribe upon the subject. The Principles which the local Government propose to adopt appear to oe as follows (1) Officers under treatment in a Government Hospital should enjoy the benefit, free of charge, of the ordinary medicines, dressings and the like which are available in that hospital. (2^ v flicers should not be charged for medicines, dressings ets. If they attend as outpatients a Government dispensary at which such medicines etc. are available, or it their authorised medical attendants recommend that they should be supplied free. 13i Ofiicers on comfortable salaries should ordinarily be expected to have their prescriptions made up at a druggist's shop, (4) Ho Government servant or class of GoTernment servants should be entitled to free supply of prophylatio vaccines except as members of the general public. (6) Vaccines and medicines procured from the open market should not be supplied free, whether to indoor or outdoor patients should be those medicines only that are ordinarily stocked inhospitals and dispensaries. 2. It is not clear from tiie local Government's letter whether these principles are intended to a^ply only to British officers of the Superior Civil Services or to all Government servants. The Government of India have considered them, however, only in their relation to such ^ritish officers. Their interest in the case is confined to seeing that such officers receive the benefit of the medical concessions outlined in paragraph 95 of of the Lee Commission's Report, which the Secretary of State accepted and prescribed for adoption. The local Government are competent to frame such directions as they think fit in the matter in respect of aU other classes of officers under them. 3, Subject to the above understanding, and to the remarks that follow, the Government of India have n objection to the principles propounded by the local Government, and have few comments to offer oh them. As regards principles Wo.llj, however, it may be mentioned that the Government of India in 1927 decided that the terms medical charges and free medical attendance used in their letter Ho.996-h e alth dated the 9th July, 1926, include the free supply of medicines ordinarily stocked in Government hospitals and dispensaries, but do not include any special medicines ehich may ft^ve to be procured from outside sources for treatment of a patient, such special medicines being paid f.r by the patient himself . The principle conforms with that decision. As regards No.3 the Government of India have no objec tion to the view that well to do officers should ordinarily be expected to have medicines made up at Chemists Shops on pay ment, . This principle should not, however^, apply even to well to do officers when they are under treatment in hospital, they should then be allowed to obtain their medicines on the same terms as other patients. As regards (4) the Government of India would observe that if prouhylactic vaccines are stocked in a Government hospital and if an entitled officer is treated in that hospital, he should bot be liable to pay for any such vaccine that may be required for his treatment.Principle No.(5) should be subject to the same understanding as lTo.(3j (4?) viz, that when vaccines, et. are stocked in a hospital even though they may have been procured in the open market, an entitled officer should not be liable to pay for them if he is treated in that hospital and if those vaccines are required for his treatment.

ARMY DEPARTMENT. New Delhi, the 9th April 1934* To A ll LOCAL GOVERNMENTS and ADMINISTRATIONS. Policy and procedure in regard to the forfeiture of military pensions and other military awards. S ir, It has been represented to the Government of India that it is desirable that they should reaffirm, and in certain respects amplify, the orders which have been issued from time to time in regard to the continuance or forfeiture of pensions, rewards, etc., earned by military service, the holders of which become involved in some form of seditious agitation or disloyalty towards Government. The Government of India understand that there is a feeling among serving soldiers in particular that the intentions of Government in regard to this matter should be made clear and should be consistently canied out; and the Governor-General in Council is accordingly pleased to issue the following instructions on the subject. 2. The liability to forfeit pension may be incurred without a pensioner having been actually convicted by a ciiminal Qourt of an offence connoting disaffection or disloyalty towards Government : in other cases the liability arises directly from such conviction. In order to determine the practice and procedure which should be followed, it is necessary to deal with these two classes of cases separately, and it is also necessary to make it clear that there must be a difference of treatment in regard to (i) pensions, jangi inams, and other forms of recurring money payments, and (ii) grants of land given as rewards for military service. 3. Cases in which the liability to forfeit pension is incurred without the pensioner having heen actually convicted of an offence connoting disaffection or disloyalty towards Government. —The Government of India have decided that the following principles shall apply :— {i) Subject to the investigation of each case on its merits, seditious and violent agitation against the administration falls within the meaning of the expression ' grave misconduct ' for the purposes of paragraph 184, Pension Regulations, and agita tion in the form of passive resistance to the orders of Govern ment or advocacy of such a course may, in certain circumstances, be examined, amount to ' grave misconduct ' ; (u) active support or advocacy of the civil disobedience or non-co- operation or allied movements which aim at subverting the Government by law established also constitutes ' grave mis conduct ' for the purposes of the rule cited above, each case being treated on its merits [vide A. D. letter No. B.-27139/1 (A. G.-8), dated the 16th November J9331 ; (in) a warning should be given to the pensioner before penal action is resorted to, but Jie Local Government or Administration may, at their discretion, dispense with such a warning.It must be recognised, however, that these pensioners are not amenable to the Indian Army Act, and the military authorities will not take any action unless and until a Local Government or Administration makes a definite recommendation to the District Commander, to the effect that a pensioner should forteit his pension. On receipt of such a recommendation the question of withdrawing the pension under the provisions of paragraph 184, Pensioi\ Regulations, will be considered by the District Commander to whom authority is hereby granted— («') to older the forfeiture of pension in all such cases, and {ii) to restore the pension from such date as is considered suitable in cases where the Local Government or Administration and the District Commander are satisfied, on a guarantee of future good behaviour having been given, that this ought to be done. The Government of India desire to emphasise that these instructions are intended to be acted upon, and that it is particularly desirable in present circumstances that adequate use should be made of them. It will be observed that under these instructions action has to be initiated by the civil authc- rities; and the civil authorities may feel less reluctance in taking action if they realise that it is not the intention that a pension withdrawn under these orders should in all cases be permanently forfeited. 4. Gases in which the liability to forfeit pension arises out of the pensioner having been convicted of some offence connoting disaffection or disloyalty towards Government. —In these cases the military pensioner will automatically forfeit his pension from the date of his arrest, and the forfeiture of pension will continue dming the period of imprisonment and thereafter, unless and until orders specifically directing the restoration of the pension are obtained. It will rest with the pensioner, if he desires to have his pension restored, to make an application to the civil authorities, and if the Local Government or Administration, on a consideration of all the circumstances of the case, consider that leniency would be justified and make a recommendation to that effect, the District Commander, on receipt ol the recommendation and a written assurance from the pensionei of future loyalty and good behaviour, may in his discretion direct the restoration of the pension from such date as he may determine, but in no case from a date prior to the pensioner's release from prison. 5. The orders contained in the two preceding paragraphs will apply to every form of military pension, except family pensions, drawn by females and minor children and will extend also to assignments of land revenue and cash jagirs granted as rewards for military service [amended by A. D. letter No. A./29162 (A. G.-8), dated 8th December 1925]. 6. Cases in which the reward to he forfeited is a grant of land, held subject to a condition of loyalty. —Instructions on this subject also have alreadv been issued, vide the Government of India, Revenue and Agriculture Department, ■Circular letter No. 254-C., dated the 22nd February'l918, addressed to all Local Governments (copy attached). The fuither practice and procedure laid down in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this letter will, with one important excep tion, apply generally to these cases also. The exception to be made aiises out of the fact that it is hardly practicable to prescribe absolutely that a grant of land shall be automatically foifeited upon arrest or conviction. In cases where a land grant is affected, therefore, and the grant, under the terms on which it is held, is liable to forfeiture, the following shall be the procedure : (a) Action will be initiated by the civil authorities. (b) It will be appropriate in certain cases, before penal action is taken, to give the grantee a severe warning and an opportunity to mend his ways. But the Local Government or Administration acting in consultation with the District Commander will be at liberty to resume without warning in such oases as they think merit the extreme penalty.(c) The concurrence of the District Commander should be obtained in all cases before the grant is withdrawn. {d) As in the case of pensions, and on the same terms and conditions it will be open to the Local Government or Administration, in consultation with the District Commander, to restore the grant in cases where it has been forfeited temporarily. The Government of India desire in the case of land grants also, which are liable to forfeiture, that full use should be made of the powers conferred, now and at all times. It would be intolerable from every point of view, and particularly in the regard of loyal serving soldiers and loyal military pensioners that individuals who hold gifts of land, on the condition of loyal behaviour and active support of Government, should continue to enjoy those gifts when they have obviously ceased to honour the condition in the letter or in the spirit. 7. I am to request that, with the permission of Hi8 E xcellency the governor m coimci i the widest publicity may be given to these instructions : the Government of India themselves will take steps to ensure that they are made known to serving soldiers through the medium of the Fauji Akhbar and other channels. 8.

In the case of tenant grants ((such as those under peasant conditions in the Punjab Canal Colonies)), carrying a right to acquire proprie tary rights, the condition will lapse when those rights have been acquired. The terms of the grant should be so drawn as to ensure that the Local Govern ment or Administration will, in all cases, be the final authority to decide whether this condition has been violated, and, that a breach of the condition will involve resumption, either temporary or permanent, of the grant or such portion thereof as the Local Government or Administration may determine. If this is done, it will not, in the opinion of the Government of India, be necessary to bar the jurisdiction of civil courts, where the law of the Province prescribes application to those courts as the regular procedure for ejectment in such cases.

S ubject :— Despatch of mails in contravention of sections 4 and 5 of the • Indian Post Office Act. \ S ir, I am directed to address you on the subject of the reported instances of infringement of the exclusive privilege, vested in the Governor General in Council section 4 of the Indian Post Office Act, of conveying by post from one place to another of letters and of performing all the incidental services of receiving, collecting, sending, despatching and delivering all letters. 2. An investigation was recently undertaken by the Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs in this connection. Where private individuals, firms or associations were found to have been guilty of such infringement they were either prosecuted under sections 58 or 59 of the Indian Post Office Act, or warned to desist from such illegal practices. During the course of this investigation it has been ascertained that some local Governments and some Government officers have adopted practices which constitute an in fringement of section 4 of the Indian Post Office Act. These practices so far ascertained are of the following character : (1) Some local governments or officers under them have made arrange ments for the collection, conveyance and distribution of their correspondence between their provincial capital and their summer headquarters or between places under their jurisdic tion. (2) The secretariat of one local Government has adopted the practice of enclosing in one cover letters addressed to a number of officers at another station and sending this cover to an officer at that station, the officer effecting the distribution of the letters con tained in the cover. (3) Some executive engineers have made arrangements with the owners of a motor service for the conveyance of their correspondence ♦ and its delivery through the driver of the motor vehicle to their subordinate or other offices on the route. (4) Some heads of departments of Government have adopted the practice referred to in (2) above. (5) Some Police officers have adopted the practice of collecting and conveying correspondence between district headquarters and the different police stations in the district through agents of their own. 3. These practices were considered by the government of India as involv ing prima facie a contravention of section 4 of the Indian Post Office Act and the local Governments concerned were addressed ^for their views. In reply it has been urged by the local Governments that—■ \a) the methods adopted involve a definite saving to the local Govern ments or the officers concerned in the expenditure on postage charges and have therefore been adopted as a measure of economy ; (5) the practices adopted are covered by exception (6) to section 4 of the Indian Post Office Act; (c) the exclusive privilege conferred by the Act on the Governor General in Council cannot operate against the Crown, that is, against any local Government or a department of Government or an officer of Government in connection with his official corres pondence.3 4. I am now to deal with these arguments :— {a) The Government of India have no doubt that in the case of some particular services such as those between the provincial capital and the summer headquarters of a local Government between which large quantities of correspondence are carried at one time or in the case of such services as involve comparatively short journeys by railway or by motor vehicles, it is possible to arrange for the conveyance of correspondence at a cost less than postage charges. The saving might be substantial where the collection, conveyance and distribution is effected through the agency of an existing permanent staff with different primary functions. It must, however, be remembered that the inland postage rates fixed by the Postal Department are uniform for the whole of India and Burma and these charges have been fixed at comparatively low figures because of the exclusive privilege which the Governor General in Council possesses under the Act. The heavier expenditure incurred on long distance traffic and on traffic of comparatively small volume is balanced by the smaller expenditure incurred on short distance traffic and on traffic handled in large quantities at a time, whereon the capacity of the staff can be utilised to the full. The system obviously breaks down if the postal department is deprived of short distance and other remunerative traffic while it is required to convey long distance and other unremunerative traffic. Moreover, there is no real economy in these arrange ments which amount to the creation of a parallel organisation running simultaneously with the postal service. The expendi ture incurred by the Posts and Telegraphs Department cannot be reduced in any way, as its organisation has to run in any case for the collection, conveyance and distribution of other mails, and the expenditure incurred by the local Governments for the particular services is superfluous and avoidable. (6) The argument that the arrangements made by the local Govern ments or their officers for the conveyance of their mails through their own agency are covered by exception {b) under section 4 of the Indian Post Office Act has been carefully examined by the Government of India and they are of the definite opinion that the exception does not cover the practices adopted by local Governments or their officers. The Government of India con sider that it would be straining the language of section 4 (1) (6) to hold that the correspondence carried by this means concerns solely the sender or the receiver thereof. The correspondence is sent or received by the officers in their public capacity and they are concerned in it as agents of Government and therefore it cannot solely concern their affairs. The local Government cannot be considered as an individual for the purpose of this exception and it cannot be both the sender and the receiver of the letters. If the line of argument adopted by the local Governments were accepted, it would enable every company or firm or association to run its own service for the collection, conveyance and distribution of its correspondence between its head office and its branch offices and between the branch offices themselves, a claim which cannot be recognised in any circum stances. (c) The exclusive privilege of conveying by post from one place to another and also the exclusive privilege of performing all the incidental services of receiving, collecting, sending and des patching all letters, has been conferred by section 4 of the Indian Post Office Act on the Governor General in Council only ; it is exercised by him through the sole agency of the Posts and Telegraphs Department, and no other Government agency has ( ) To Major Provinces only.been authorized to exercise this right on his behalf. The argu ment that because the Crown has not been expressly tovnd by the Act, therefore local Governments and other Government agencies are not bound by section 4, is beside the mark.e selection of the Governor General in Council as being ^ntitled to the exclusive privilege necessarily prevents any other Govern ment agency from exercising it. 5. I am accordingly to request that, (with the permission of His Excel, lency the Governor in Council) steps may kindly be taken to discontinue torth- with existing unauthorized services, if any, to issue strict orders to all depart ments and to all officers of the local Government to discontinue any arrange ments of the kind which may exist, and to consign in future all correspondence to the post office for collection, conveyance and distribution.
