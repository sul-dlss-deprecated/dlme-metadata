The <i>Ma&rsquo;at</i> amulet (no. 2) and heart scarabs (nos. 1, 3, 11), which occurred in many forms, guaranteed a successful judgment of the dead. The amulets of a hand (no. 8), lungs and a windpipe (no. 12), and <i>wadjet</i>-eyes (i.e., &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; eyes; no. 4) protected those parts of the body and also had connotations of resurrection and the unity or integrity of the mummy. The enigmatic <i>aper</i> amulet (no. 13) takes the form of the hieroglyph meaning &ldquo;to be equipped,&rdquo; perhaps in reference to the mummy&rsquo;s preparation. The two crowns (nos. 5, 6) were symbols of power. The Heh insignia (no. 7), like the popular <i>ankh</i>-sign, denoted eternal life. Among the living, the frog (no. 9) and possibly also the hare (no. 10) suggested fertility. The amulets of the Four Sons of Horus (no. 15) perhaps served, as they did with canopic jars, to protect various organs of the body.<br />", "summary": "", "rank": 0, "label_date": "2019-11-10", "date_added": "2019-11-20 17:48:55", "approved_for_web": 1}], "artists": [], "collections": [{"id": 5, "name": "Egyptian, Classical, Ancient Near Eastern Art", "folder": "egyptian", "rank": 0}], "exhibitions": [{"id": 648, "title": "Egypt Reborn: Art for Eternity"}, {"id": 3329, "title": "Ancient Egyptian Art"}], "related_items": [{"accession_number": "16.580.28", "object_id": 3176}, {"accession_number": "16.580.48", "object_id": 3177}, {"accession_number": "16.580.51", "object_id": 3178}, {"accession_number": "08.480.109", "object_id": 3240}, {"accession_number": "08.480.159", "object_id": 3244}, {"accession_number": "51.223.1", "object_id": 3562}, {"accession_number": "51.223.2", "object_id": 3563}, {"accession_number": "51.223.3", "object_id": 3564}, {"accession_number": "57.76.1", "object_id": 3633}, {"accession_number": "37.1169E", "object_id": 4124}, {"accession_number": "86.226.22", "object_id": 4246}, {"accession_number": "08.480.143", "object_id": 19205}, {"accession_number": "51.223.4", "object_id": 65617}, {"accession_number": "59.180", "object_id": 76203}, {"accession_number": "72.38", "object_id": 98589}, {"accession_number": "37.885E", "object_id": 117477}, {"accession_number": "15.523", "object_id": 119440}], "geographical_locations": [{"id": 6863634, "name": "Egypt", "type": "Place collected"}], "videos": [], "images": [{"filename": "CUR.08.480.93_mummychamber.jpg", "id": 135556, "standard_size_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size2/CUR.08.480.93_mummychamber.jpg", "thumbnail_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size0_sq/CUR.08.480.93_mummychamber.jpg", "derivatives": [{"size": "0", "width": 96, "height": 72}, {"size": "1", "width": 192, "height": 144}, {"size": "2", "width": 384, "height": 288}, {"size": "3", "width": 768, "height": 576}, {"size": "4", "width": 1536, "height": 1152}], "largest_derivative_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size4/CUR.08.480.93_mummychamber.jpg", "largest_derivative": "4", "description": "Egypt Reborn: Mummy Chamber Installation (2011)", "caption": " <em>Wadjet-Eyes and Papyrus Stalks</em>, ca. 945-718 B.C.E. or later.
