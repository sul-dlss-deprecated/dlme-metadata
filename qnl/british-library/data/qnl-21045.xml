The position her© as regards the divers is 4 At the beginning of the season they receive an advance,the amount of which is arbitrarily deemed by the Ruler, of course on the advice of the ITakhudas, The advance is debited in the divers account.He is also supplied with a ba=r of rice for which he is debited any fantastic sum it nmy please the IfaJchuda to write. In addition nearly every ft account contains a s am for interest amounting often io about 4.0*1-tyr 50% per annua. After the season the pearls are supposed to b© sold by the Ilakhuda in the presence of the crew &amp; each diver gets his share•In practice the Hakhuda sells privately credits p the diver with anything he thinks fit. This is generally Shallowed up by the debit side of the account due to the interest &amp; excessive charges for food etc. After the season the diver receives another advance to support hiri till the next season.It is also debited in his account plus further interest. After the first year of diving,a diver seldom gets out of debt,He is obliged to fserve his Falrhuda while he is in debt unless he can get another Hakhuda to take him over &amp; pay of** his debt.Jlakhudas sometimes do this although the scut paid is seldom anything like the debt said to he owed by ■ ; 'he diver, since the Nakhuias are all aware of the nature of the accounts kept by them f-. accomodate each other. The diver thereafter becomes indebted to the new JIakhuda ,of course to the extant of the debt he theoretically owed the previoss man. Often the transaction is done without t'-e divers full knowledge. For instance the new diver will, to obtain his consent,%a^l him he is taking him over for Rs TOO.If a disp' 1arls «8 later,the Uakhada thm produoea a species of aoooimt to she v he peli the previous enpl oyer, say, R b 900.The previous eHpl 0 y C r ,who in ell probability only rooeired about Hs 100, being the trna balanoi due to him, has however.as part of tte bargain.glvon a receipt for jHs 900 to enable the purchaser to practically easlive the diver, in th- event of dispute the only authority for settling oases is the Sail! oh* Court.

POLITICAL AG Jiwafciitsfcx KUWAIT, 3rd March 1923, In reply to your D.O, of the 27th February 1923, The rough idea of the diving industry here in Kuwait is much the same as you describe at Bahrain, but it is not abused to Quite the same extent. The chief difference ■** and a very big one - is that the crews normally do know what the pearls fetch arid consequently do get their shares approximately correct. There are, of course, some who go in for selling on the quiet, but they are well known and have such a bad name that I believe they now have difficulty in getting, new blood to take on with them, r.ny divers are more or less permanently in debt, it is true, but &amp;y no means all, ^.uite a fair number of Kuwait men go in for diving without taking any advance at, all, and whey simply pouch half uieir own particular uake, ana aispose of pearls as they like. Here in iiUwait the P»A» has nothing, to do with the • -I ah , out two men who, I know, are on it - a I am not sure if there are others - are about as straight as you could gety I snoulc say, but they fire nakhudaa, and probably have a bias, I think the dirtiest thing, here is the work of the financiers - also simply known as 'nakhuda 1 -. 20 per cent, is their normal rate when they finance a boat, with the refusal of all pearls taken, which they can buy at their own valuationHo. / Office .

Tii® Political Agency, Bahrein. From Captain C.G.Prior Political Agent, Bahrein. To The Secretary t® the Political Resident, in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. if Sir, I have received a letter from the Adviser to the Bah rein Government in which he tells me that he has information leading him to suppose that Abdul Rahman C^usaiM will attempt to start the cultivation of cultured pearl® in Bahrein. He suggests that whether the information he ture or not, legisla tion might he considered with a view to prevent this. There is no need for me to point out the harm that would result to the Pearling indmstry of Bahrein if it were to be sus pected by the big buyers that cultured pearls were being made on the banks her®. Bahrein pearls are celebrated for their colour, quality and lustr^ and any suggstion that they were being tampered with would have a most serious effect on all cona nected with the industry. While it will not be difficult for the Bahrein Government to prevent their own subjects manufacturing such pearls, yet it c, . . , ■, v : . v'. ■ ', : will be impossible for them to exercise any control over foreign ers doing so on the Banks, for as the then Political Agent men tioned in para 4 of his letter No.247 dated I/I2/29 the Banks 1 are free to all, and should for example a Persian desire to com mence such an industry it would be hard to prevent. The only way that this could be done would be to extent the Bahrein Order in Council to the Banks or to secure an agreement between all Gov ments who send divers there. This would presumably include t11 Persian Government. ( A question which has not yet arisen this year but which may he raised in an acute form before long is the use by Persians of proper diving apparatus# and this if insisted on would undoubtedly cause a free fight at the Banksy &gt; - 4. I confess that I am ignorant of the chances of raisin^ ing cultured pearls succesfully in the free for all conditions that obtain here. I understand that such pearls take a conside erable time to grow, and I see no means of the cultivators protecting their oysiirs during the pearls infancy. The prob lem must have arisen in Ceylon and I suggest the Ceylon Gov ernment be asked for information in the matter# 5. The possibility of successfully producing such ■pearls does not alarm me as much as Mr Belgrave® but even the threat of it will have an adverse effect on our staple induss try and I should be glad to know the views of the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the matter. I have the honour to be* Sir, Your mos^ obedient servant jF Politic0irt$ H b M xb in©b .No. 1337/4S. K Bahrain, Persian Gulf. Dated, 9th February, 1930 Dear Prior, Herewith a note on diving conditions. It is a subject thet I feel verv stronsdv about and though J have not said so I think there is a tendency towards a relapse. I know that many of the ITakhudas are dodging the rules by keeping side accounts, besides their official ones 3 and various other things, but it needs a lot of time to examine the matter and I simply have not hid time to do so this season. 'ours sincerely,Slavery and the Bahrain Pearl Industry. .although slavery was officially abolished in 1861, when the Shaikh of Bahrain made a treaty with the British Govermrient by which he agreed to abstain from it in return for protection, the condition of the pearl divers was, until a few years ago, almost that of slaves. The diving community consists of 3 categories: the shore merchants who do the big buying and selling and who either own or finance the boats, the nakhudas or boat captains, and the large inarticulate mass of divers, illiterate arabs who were previously cheated and oppres sed by their employers, or rather their owners, the boat captains. About 15,000 local divers go out from Bahrain every season and it has been estimated that about 100,000 men from the whole Gulf are employed on the banks every year. The diving system is admirable in theory. Sach boat's profits are shared proportionally between tne Captain, the divers and the pullers after the Captain had deducted cost of fooa, general expenses, a - amount which he advanced to the divers at bne bc^innin^ and end of the season. In practice the system was abominable. 'Then once a young man took a loan from a. captain ne could nc/or pay it off, and as long as he was in debt he was forced to dive. The debts were increased Dy enormous interest being charged on every advance, food and living materials were debited against the diver at extortionate prices, as the diver was illiterate he could never check his accountMost divers existed on the small bi-annual advances which'were debited against them, with interest. These conditions were favoured by the improvident and extra vagant nature of the Arab. Divers were handed over from one captain to another, sometimes to captains from foreign ports and sometimes to private individuals in payment for debts. If a diver died his house and belongings were seized by his captain o^ if he had grown up sons they were compelled to incur their father ! s debt, if the sons were children they incurred the debt when they became old enough to work. Sales of pearls were conducted privately captain and merchant and usually the prices obtained were higher than the amount annoiniCcd uu tue divers. The captains pocketed the difference. Infirm old men and young boys were forced to dive and any in subordination was punished by floggings ena wrious tortures. Io questions were asked about deaths that o enured at the banks. During the off season-the divers were made to work in the houses and garaens 01 taeii owners. Attempts to improve the diving system met v itn difficulties# The divers were suspicious sj - &gt; the merchants and captains were violently opposed to changes that would loosen their hold over the men ana until the present Shaikh succeeded his father it was con sidered unpolitic to ^ press for reforms. I 1334 E. 3. Shaikh Hamad in conjunction with Ilajor uaxy, wno was then Political Agent, and with the support of the Government of India, took the matter in hend. Only c very few of the'more far sighted merchants, and the Shia and Sunni ^dis, supported the movement, but thethe reforms were finally pushed through mainly owing to the keenness and energy of Major Daly. 4 The principal features are as follows.- The amount of the advances and the amount of interest permissible is laid down by law. Eo other charges may be debited against a diver. Merchants and boat captains are compelled to keep regular accounts, which were made out by a number of diving clerks who are authorized by the Government. Svery diver keeps a small book issued by the Government wnich shows nis account with his captain. Boat captains are forbidden to sell the pearls privately but must do so in the pre sence of not less than three of the divers. When a diver dies his children are not made to take over his debts and dive for his captain, the debt becomes an ordinary one against the estate. x^o person ^ doco not own a diving boat may take over divers for &gt;bt. fhese. and various other rules, nave grenuxv improved the diving conditions. Although men who have been diving for a long time are still hopelessly inciebo- ed to their captains, and t ill remain so until uhe.y die the new generation of divers are no lon^.r m the I::, Previously a diver had no against his captain, a court existed, but it con sisted of boat captains and its reputation was notorious. Divers now realise when they are cheated and appeal to the courts when they find that the diving rules are not being carried out by their employers. Tlr re still remains an influential party of rerohants and captains who bitterly resent the improved conditions and who continually try to upset and evade them. - e strictest supervision is needed by the Government and thethe Courts to prevent a return to the previous state.V Fo. of 1929. ixritibh Residency &amp; Oonsulcite-G-eneral, Bushire, the 26^ June 1929. To The Political Agent, Bahrein. Sir, mth reference to your letter Mo.0/77 dated / tne 2nd June 1929, I am directed to inform you that the trade in cultured pearls has already 'been prohibited 'by the Shaikh of Bahrein and the prohibition would haturally apply to any cultured pearls produced 'by Ahdul Hahman QusaiM. The Hon'hle the Political 'Resident 'believes that the Ara'b divers and merchants whose livelihood would he threatened 'by Qusaihi f s action, may 'be trusted effectively to prevent his profiting at their expense. As the pearl Oould 'banks are free to all no individual Arah or Persian Government/ afford him the protection he would require to 'bring to maturity any plan he may have conceived. In the case of a fracas at sea appearing imminent H.H's Government, in view of its position as Policeman of the seas of the Persi n Gulf would interfere to preserve order ' « and could then presumably adjudicate in the dispute. There is,however, no livelihood that event^Will reach this stage as Abdul Eahman Ousaibi knows the strength of Arab feeling in the matter. I have the honour to be, Sir, # Tour most obedient servant, Captain Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.D .O. No. 0. 58^ iM- The 5th April 1930 It is rumpured that the Qusaibis have ordered three diving suits from Europe and expect them in two months time. The employment of diving apparatus has hitherto been forbidden, and a Persian who asked permission a year or two a ;o was refused. Again, last year Colonel Barrett told the American Consul at Basra that divinrc apparatus was not allowed. this 2. Any persons usingV apparatus wouW. probably be attack- -ed by the infuriated divers on other craft for the menace to their livelihood is clearly understood, and H.M.Navy and pur- -selves would undoubtedly be drawn into it. 3. In this instance, the Bahrain Government propose shortly to issue an ordinance prohibiting the import of diving suits and if these come to impound and destroy them. This will dispose of the matter for this year, but tuere is notxiin, to prevent their import via Kuwait or Debai. 4. I dont know how far it is possible to put the brake on the wheels of progress and the correspondence regarding tawashing in motor launches will help to show you how people regard innovations. In this case the ben was finally rsisea, but The Hon'ble Lieut-Colonel H .V.Biscoe, I.A., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, * Bushire.K 'V# *»#■ but since mechanical diving would deprive many thousands of men of a living, no matter how bare or arduous it may be, I feel that this particular innovation should be resisted at all costs, and any action taken to prevent it would well worth the support of all classes* 5. I discussed the matter with Mr. Sal Pack, the most intelligent and experienced of the pearl buyers, and he told me that the only reason why these banks had not be n fish -ed out as the Australian ana Phi Hi pine banks ^ave been was due to the absence of the diving; ajpratus and intensive pearling. Even so he considered that the quality had aeterio- -rated in the last XMX fifteen years.4' ^he Residency, ft: Bnshire, 12 ~ April 1930. D. 0. Ho. -S.

With regard to the proposed import of (living suits I think the State would be well advised to issue their decree now regarding them as we are approaching the open- -ing of the diving season. Has anything more been heard about them? Dalrjmple Belgrave, Esquire, Adviser, Bahrain Government, Bahrain.no . c/ :* V Confidential, The Agency, Bahrain. 24th lay 1930. V My dear Colonel The * Raicbah ' has not passed ofi without excitement this year, and the reason I did not iceep you in- formed of the situation was that I felt I could deal with BAtaW'faiand that had an emergency occurred a sloop would j have 'been the only cure. 2. You will remember that last year the advances were fixed at Rs 100 for divers and Rs 80 for haulers, and that as a result of a demostration of divers at Muharraq Shaikh Hamad very weakly gave way and allowed a further advance of Rs 30 for divers and 25 for haulers. The only excuse for his weakness was that one of the leading nakhudas, Jabar bin Musallam of Kidd, veered round to the divers side after hav- supported the other merchants and joined them in the demand for larger advances. It should be noted that the divers have never realised that it is in their interests and to get them out of debt that these advances are controlled, uut tue merchants are more inclined than before to cut down their ad vances as they are short of cash, and Jabar bin l/iusallam was jproba^ly actuated last year by a desire to embarrass his •rivals who could ill afford the extra advances sanctioned. - '/hen a nan owns five or six hundred divers it will oe seen what a difference such an increase means. The object of the Rakbah advance^ I b to keep the men's families while they are away diving. , 3. This year the advances had been fixed at 80/- and 60/- respectively, after consultation with the leading merchants, and the proclamation was published on the I4th :..:ay, after thesJoint Court had risen, so that the Shaikh should not be involved in a similar demonstration and force our hands. Most of the foreign divers were over at Huharraq and IiidoPage 2. Ljf\ anc I liad asked the Adviser to send as many ofthe Indian Police over there as could be spared, together with Captain Parke, so that if any disorders as occurred three years ago should happen it would oe possible to nip them in the bud. The foreign divers number in all several thousand men, many of them being little better than savages, particularly the Omanis and Muscat is. .■ ■ ■ ; /sS; 4. There was a considerable amount of excitement in ranama on the 15 th, and Ban ias and Jews did their best to create a panic by closing their shops and hustling their gear away to their houses. A deputation of Jews came round to see me in great alarm, and I told them that there was no cause for it ■aAaem. I had .kept well in touch with the situation and as far as I could see there was no Jusijtfication^any ataxia.excitement, but the incident shows what tk results of mass suggestion in a small place can be. 5. Since nothing had occurred by the I7th I hoped that the divers had made up their minds to take what they were given, but with complete unanimity they forged an entirely new weapon; none of them would go out and dive at all. Ti.e Shaikh sent for 3elgrave and talked so foolishly that I thought it better to take a hand and I asked hiyi to come and see me. ■ He came in on the 20th, and Abdullah and Salman were also pre sent. He talked very foolishly about the poor divers and 7 the necessity of being generous to them. I told him that he \[ . ; was directly responsible for this years troubles by his unneces sary weakness last year# and asked him if he was going to pay the divers since the merchants had no money. He was, I regret to say, in a state of obstinate funk, and could not be brought to see that if the Government again altered their proclamation as soon as it was put up, simply because divers refused go out, they were storing up trouble for the future. 6. 'bdullah ,vho lives in Huharraq, was apprehensive / about the swarms of wild men who were hanging round it, and therevwere only two courses open to us. One was for me toPage 3. / a 8 : coerce the foreign divers, who were the bacichone of the pass ive resisters, or else to devise some concession which would save the face of the Bahrain Government. I think a little pressure would have brought them to reason, hut seeing the Shaikh would give me no support and .ould certainly blame me for any trouble that occurred^ Abdullah suggested that the nalchudas should be allowed to give a loan if they wanted to, up to 20/- for divers and 15/- for pullers against their tisqam % or end of season advance, and since it seemed likely that this would enable the nakhudas with Bahrain! divers to get their men out ( arioso make it difficult for the others to stay behind as they always think that the boats that get out first may stumble on some big find ) I advised the Shaikh to allow this, and arranged for it to be done in a way that would save the Bahrain Government 1 face ' to some extent. 7. The Bahrain Government had decided that they would not enforce decrees against the divers salafs, and I had agreed to this,but without enthusiasm since it meant revising orders in over a hundred cases, and since almost all our divers had left their homes provided for and only wanted their salafs to spend on new bishts and a final orgy of whoring, but a new complication now arose. To accpjet a ' tisqam ' at the close of the year binds the diver to dive for that nakhuda in the en- ■X. &lt; v. suing year, and men who had nearly paid off their debts did not want to bind themselves for another year by simply taking a loan of 20A This difficulty was tided over and next day a number of Bahrain boats set out and finally, to day, practically SaltesL - all the remainder of the fleet have 8. Belgrave's attitude over the salafs is not alto gether reasonable. Oae is of course kn anxious to keep the di- v N; vers out of debt as far as possible, but when they are setting out on four months very hard, work a substantial advance is only reasonable, and if an advance lower than this years would make the divers look about for some other employment!^ if Bexgrave had his way, I think he would reduce them still further. Shailthf on the other hand,is never happier than when giving awuy other people's money, in^case the merchants, who are very hard4 \ I IN FILE 10/ 12 of 19 30.

Bus hire # * Sir, I have the honour to say tliat 1 recently paid a visit to the pearling ban cs and hoarded a considerable number of vessels almost all belonging to Bahrain owners. The nakhudas and clivers all appeared very glad to see me,hut one or two were rather nervous that I might he interested in inspecting their diving licenses. I gave each hoat a present of fresh limes and sugar to ward off scurvy and also distributed some medicine I had brought with me. Two divers who appeared to be seriously ill I brought back with me. One was found to have tubercolosis and cannot live longer and the second was seriously ill with, syphil/is. In spite of the conditions on the hanks, which to our minds appear appalling, the divers in general appear both healthy and contented. I saw no case of harsh treatment nor were any reported to me. I was everywhere infonaed that this year's catch had so far proved extremely poor and was shown few pearls of any importance. There is a tendency,however,for nakhudas to conceal the discovery of fine pearls which they only show to those whom S, *. ».*&gt; . * *r mm, M «- possibly being to keep prices &lt;kmm*^ The weather at the banks was very hot but calin ovang to thp failure of the bareh and divers have been able to get in moreI in im early part of the year and this in itself should produce a greater quantity,if^of peore, quality of ^earla during this pearling season.

A large portion of the file is occupied by handwritten balance sheets (all undated) of saibs (pullers) and ghais (divers) showing the payments, loans and debts for individuals (ff 5-36). Also included is a report, written in 1930 by Britain's Advisor to the Government, Charles Belgrave, entitled 'Slavery and the Bahrain Pearl Industry' (ff 49-52);2) The threat posed by modern innovations to the traditional nature of the pearling industry in Bahrain and the wider Gulf coast. Of chief concern are the modern diving technologies that commercial enterprises wish to use, and the introduction to the Gulf of cultured pearls. Included in the file is a translation of a proclamation from 1930, which bans the import of cultured or tinted pearls, the sale of unbleached, drilled pearls, and the import or use of diving apparatus (f 62). A letter from a Glasgow-based company to the India Office in London, dated 15 May 1931, seeks advice on obtaining a license to use its modern diving apparatus to dive for pearls in the Gulf (f 65). A return letter dated 21 August 1931 rejects the possibility of obtaining a permit to dive in the Gulf (f 74).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Pearl industry and trade</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000359#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
