The sect of Wahabis was founded by Abdul 'Wahab, and his son, Mahomed bin Abdul Wahab, in the early part of the 18th century, in the country of Nejd in Arabia. Abdul Wahab was a native of Nejd. Like the prophet of Islam, he began life as a travelling merchant. In this capacity he visited Basrah and Baghdad, and even journeyed through Persia. On his return to Nejd, he began to promulgate his peculiar tenets, which did not involve the idea of a Reforma tion like Protestantism, but rather a return to the primitive simplicity which prevailed amongst the early followers of Islam, whilst the Prophet was still alive. 2. Under such circumstances, the Wahabis were neither Sunnis nor Shiahs. Both the latter sects sprung up after the WW death of Mahometi an d under c i rcum . stances which involved a veneration for certain individuals as successors of Mahomet; a veneration or adoration that is altogether opposed to the essence of Wahabism, which forbids all invocations to any man whatever, whether Saint or Prophet. The Sunnis pin their faith upon the three first Caliphs, Abu- beker, Omar, and Othman, whom they considered to be the only true successors of the Prophet. The Shiahs, who deny the ri^ht of the three first Caliphs to succeed Mahomet, assert that Ali, the fourth Caliph, and husband of Maho met's daughter Fatima, and Ali's two sons,'Hassan, and Hussein, were the imme diate successors of the Prophet. The Sunnis invoke the four first Caliphs. The Shiahs invoke Ali and his two sons. Besides these early Caliphs, both Sunnis and Shiahs ofler up prayers to numbers of saints. Abdul Wahab, however, was above all such considerations. He reverted to the first formula of Islam,— There is but one God 1' He taught that Grod alone was the proper object of worship and invocation; and that Mahomet, Jesus Christ, Moses, and others, who were respected by the Sunnis as prophets, were, in reality, nothing more than great men. 3. It will thus be seen that whilst the rise of the Wahabis is to be ascribed to a date so late as the commencement of the last century, the causes of that rise may be referred to a very remote period. .From time immemorial there has been al ways an opposition between the people of Nejd, or the central table land of Arabia, and the people of Hejaz on the coast of the Bed Sea. The people of Nejd are sober and austere, averse to all foreign luxury and display, and tenaciously attached to their ancestral usages. The people of Hejaz on the sea^-coast are, on the other hand, light and volatile, dis solute in their manners, and fond of ornament and magnificence. This opposi tion between the people of the central highlands, and the livelier people on the sea-coast, has been aggravated by political events. During the century which preceded the advent of Mahomet, the men of Nejd had maintained a supremacy in Arabia; but in consequence of the spread of Islam, this supremacy was ulti mately transferred to the men of Hejaz. Again there was a rivalry of prophets. When Mahomet began to preach in Hejaz, a rival prophet, named Moseilemah, began to preach in Nejd. Mahomet, treated Moseilemah with scorn, and nick named him the Liar,' but whenever a new chapter of the Koran was promul gated by Mahomet, a burlesque imitation of it was promulgated by Moseilemah. A collision between the followers of the rival prophets was consequently to be expected ; but the men of Hejaz were for a long period afraid to attack the men of Nejd. It was only after the former had been disciplined by extended con quest that they marched against Nejd. Then an obstinate battle ensued in which Moseilemah was slain ; but Eiadh, the capital of Nejd and native place of * This and the 2nd Chapter are taken from the excellent introductory Chapter of Captain Talboya Wheeler'a Hiatdry of the Wahabis. the Bed Sea.

The result was that the people of Nejd retained their liberty and independence on the condition of making a nominal profession of Islam. 4. During the eleven centuries which intervened between the rise of Islam in the seventh century, and the outbreak General viev&gt; of Arabia : the old empire of Yemen. of ^ Wahabig in the eighteenth Century, the history of Arabia Is almost a blank. The progress of affairs, however, was largely influenced by previous events, which have been much neglected by his torians, but which may, perhaps, be briefly indicated here. It appears that, about a century before the advent of Mahomet, the old empire of Yemen, of which dim memorials are preserved in Himyaritic inscriptions, was already on the decline. Originally established in Southern Arabia, it had gradually extended over the Hejaz, Nejd, and Oman, and also over an undefined territory beyond the exact limits of those provinces. This Yemanite empire was broken up by Abyssinian invasions. On the north-west the territory of Ghassan was finally absorbed in the Byzantine empire. On the north-east the territory of Heira, in like manner, became an outlying province of Persia, which was at that time under the dominion of the Sassanides. On the south the Yemanite dynasty was subsequently resuscitated by a Himayarite Chief, who drove out the Abyssi nian invaders, and established his rule over a large and important territory, of which Oman was a viceroyalty; but this Yemanite dynasty, like that of Heira, was compelled to pay tribute to Persia. In the centre the rude clans of Nejd established their independence, and exercised a supremacy over other quarters of the peninsula. Tour Oovirnmenit »• Arabia at tia advent of 6. At the advent of IMahomet there K ahomtt ' were thus four different G-orernments in Arabia Ut—The Byzantine empire on the north-west, which had extended its frontier to within an easy distance of Medina. 2nd —The Persian province of Heira on the north-east, which extended from the lower Euphrates to the Persian Gulf, and inland to the limits of Nejd Proper. 3rd, —The Yemanite rule, including Oman, and also paying tribute to Persia. 4th. —The Nejd tribes on the central table land, who were grouped round the prophet Moseilemah. Besides these four Governments, several small but energetic Jewish com munities possessed independent strongholds. The Bedouin tribes also, who had been emancipated by the great convulsion which had rent Central and Northern Arabia from the empire of Yemen, had obtained considerable importance, and did much to aggravate the prevailing confusion. 6. The political idea of Mahomet and his companions in Hejaz was to ■ ^ „ , , • , r- conquer the entire peninsula, and brins: Trogrett of Mustulman conquest %n Arabia. j , -i • • V -i . . 0 it under one law, religion, and dominion. The result is a matter of history. The Greeks were vanquished, and the authority of the Byzantine empire was banished for ever from Arabia. The Persian authority in Heira was overthrown by the fiery enthusiasm of the early Mussulmans. The people of Yemen suffered themselves to be incorporated into the Hejaz empire almost without a blow. The Jews were either driven out or extinguished. The people of Nejd alone stood aloof under their prophet Moseilemah, and only gave in a nominal adherence after a severe and obstinate struggle. Under such circumstances, the people of Nejd still nourished a bitter hatred against Hejaz and Islam, and naturally yielded to the tendency to abandon their allegiance to the prophet of Hejaz, and to return to their ancient customs and institutions. 7. Here it may be remarked that the political strength of Islam lay in the Tolitieal condition of Arabia between the seventh fact that it Was a rallying point for all and eighteenth centuries. ^ the dwellers in toWUS and enthusiastic lovers of Arab freedom, against the lawlessness of the Bedouin marauders and3 the aggressions of foreign rul» But Islam had no such charms for the people of Nejd. Moreover, the subsequent transfer of the Caliphat from Hejaz to Syria, and finally to Baghdad, loosened the ties which bound the people of Arabia to the creed of Islam. Ultimately all the provinces on the Persian Gulf, and Nejd in its largest sense, were dissevered from the Caliphat of Baghdad. From that date the people of Arabia have been left to work out their own destiny; and until the reign of the late Mahomed Ali over Egypt no attempt was made to march a military force into the interior. Western Asia has been convulsed by Crusaders from the west and Tartars from the east, but Arabia has been effectually shut out from foreign invasion. Meantime, each district in Arabia grouped itself around its own Chiefs and nobles, and passed through centuries of feud and rivalry in all the liberty of misrule. But still the great demarcation which prevailed before the advent of Mahomet continues down to the present day, and the old antagonism is still at work between the peoples of Nejd, Hejaz, and Oman. 8. Under such circumstances it is not surprising that when Abdul Wahab Xeiigiou* condition of Nejd at the advent of appeared, every trace of Islam had passed Aidui Wahab, away from Nejd. At the beginning of the eighteenth century the people of Nej d followed their old ancestral faith, and worshipped the Jinn in cavernous recesses, or beneath the shade of large trees, and invoked the dead and sacrificed at their tombs. Traces of the doctrines of Moseilemah still remained, together with remnants of old Sa- baean institutions; but the Koran was unread, the five daily prayers were forgotten, no one cared where Mecca lay, and tithes, ablutions, and pilgrimages were unknown. The religious dogma which was taught by Abdul Wahab that there was but one God, and that he was the God above all the Jinn or local gods, was received by the people of Nejd with alternate persecution and approval, much in the same manner that it had been originally received eleven centuries previously by the people of Hejaz. Still, however, the doctrines of Abdul Wahab must have had a peculiar charm for ^he people of Nejd, inasmuch as they were not only opposed to the practices of the men of Hejaz, but were in accordance with the special character of the people of the central highlands. This Abdul Wahab taught that the Prophet, who was invoked by the men of Hejaz, was only a man; and perhaps, he may have added that as such he was no better than the Prophet who had been originally followed by the men of Nejd. He also taught that wearing silk clothes and smoking tobacco were great sins; and both were foreign to the national character, al though both were practised by the men of Hejaz. Moreover, the contempt for ornaments, decorations, and ceremonies of every kind, even to the absence of mats from the mosques, and the neglect to take off the shoe before saying prayers, all of which are peculiar to the Wahabis, are at the same time expressions of an austerity which is in perfect accordance with the rude simpli city of the people of Nejd, and an expression of antagonism against the luxury and magnificence of the people of Hejaz. 9. Abdul Wahab died about 1760, but it is difficult to say whether he, or his son Mahomed, should be regarded ^ as the founder of the sect of Wahabis. It is certain, however, that about this time some opposition was excited against the new doctrines, not because of their austere and puritanical character, but because of the national opposition of the people of Nejd to the doctrines of Islam, which, in their original purity, were involved in the new tenets. Under these circumstances, Mahomed bin Abdul Wahab took refuge with the Arab Chief of Deriah, named Saud. He so lemnly promised that, if Saud would espouse the cause of God and make his sword the sword of Islam, he should become before his death the sole monarch of Nejd and the first potentate in Arabia. Saud accepted the offer, and professed Islam in all its purity under the direction of the Wahabi; and he gave himself out as the apostle of the new doctrine and sword of faith. Saud reigned for many years, and left to his sons the undisputed sove reignty of Inner Arabia, and a name which was respected throughout the Arabian Peninsula. Meantime, Mahomed bin Abdul Wahab supported the sword of Saud by his words and writings, but never interfered with the affairs of State, and died in 1787 at the advanced age of ninety -five^4 10. Ever since the death of Mahomed bin Abdul Wahab, his family have always held the highest judicial and reli- w S ata'bT ni h&lt;tt0ri/ of the de3eeHdants of ^ gious posts in the Wahabi empire ; but, unlike their ancestors, they have exer cised a predohiinant influence in the State, although they never adopted the official titles appertaining to pure civil or military authority. His son Ab dullah is said to have been put to death in 1818 by the great massacre of the doctors of JSTejd, which was ordered by Ibrahim Pasha, and which will be no ticed hereafter. His grandson, Abdul Rahman, was still alive at Biadh, but in decrepid old age when Palgrave visited that city in 1862. His great-grandson, Abdul Latif, was also alive, aged about forty, and the father of a large family. 11—Political History of Nejd ante 1800 to 1804. 11. At the death of Saud, about the end of the last century, his authority was acknowledged not only in the pro- TFahali empire esiabliihedhr, Saud ant* 1S00. of Ne j d p r0 p erj but alsO from the Persian Gulf to the frontiers of Hejaz. Whilst, however, Saud extended his empire over minor tribes, he carefully avoided any encroachment upon the great powers. He respected the supremacy of Persia over the island of Bah rein in the Persian Gulf, and its protectorate of Katif upon the coast. He attempted no aggressions upon the Sultan of Oman, known as the Imam of Maskat. Above all, he never violated the frontiers of the Meccan Haram, nor in any way excited the animosity of Turkey or Egypt. He was a thorough Wahabi, but he patronised learning as far as it was compatible with the tenets of Wahabi doctrines : and he adorned his capital at Deriah with national and religious monuments, such as an enormous palace and an immense mosque, of which the remains still testify to the magnificence of the first Wahabi sovereign. 12. Saud left two sons, Abdul Aziz and Abdullah. Abdul Aziz, the elder, , . succeeded to the throne, but although he Ahdul Attn, aloui 1800 i hoshhites agatntt mart- , , - iii - pxi cc l ± time Persia and Maskat, had been warned by his lather 'not to undermine the cliff,' in other words, not to excite the dangerous hostility of Turkey or Persia, he was nevertheless bent upon extending the Wahabi empire. His first campaign was against Persia. He took Katif by storm, and then occupied Bahrein and the adjacent island ; and pushed across to the eastern coast of the Gulf, to the maritime district of Barr-Faris ; and, according to Palgrave, he detached Barr-Earis irrecoverably from Persian rule. After this Abdul Aziz sent an expedition, under his bro ther Abdullah, against the Sultan of Oman. Abdullah gained a succession of victories, and finally reached the heights of Maskat, and turned the fort batteries against the town below. At that time Syud Saeed was Sultan of Oman, or Imam of Maskat. Syud Saeed yielded to the storm, and not only agreed to pay a yearly tribute to the Wahabi ruler, but admitted Wahabi garrisons into his kingdom, and permitted the erection of Wahabi mosques in Maskat and elsewhere. 13. Persia was alarmed at these successes of the Wahabi Chieftain, , . j but dared not send a Persian army into Assasstnatto* of Aldul Ante ly a fanaUcal , J , s \iah. the wilds or Arabia. Accordingly, she had recourse to a weapon which has ever been familiar to the Shiahs, namely, the dagger of the assassin. A fanatic of Ghilan offered to murder Abdul Aziz. In the first instance, he received his instructions at Tehran, and then journeyed to Meshid Hussein,* the • i,e., Kerbeiah. Mecca of the Shiahs, and procured a writ ten pardon for all past or future sins, and an assurance of the eternal joys of paradise, if he delivered the earth from, the tyrant of Nejd. He then proceeded to Deriah, and took his stand be- hind Abdul Aziz at evening prayer ; and whilst the latter was bending in adoration, he plunged his sharp Khorasan dagger through his body. Abdul Aziz fell down dead, without a groan' or struggle. His attendants seized their swords, which they had laid aside for prayer, and hewed the assassin to pieces on the floor of the mosque ; and they then found upon his corpse the writteii engagement countersigned by the Governor of Meshid Hussein.5 0 Abdullah, 1801 : invasion of Persia and capture of Meshid Hussein. li. Abdullah succeeded his brother as ruler of Nejd, and swore ven geance against the town of Meshid Hussein. About 1801 he marched an army towards the western bank of the Euphrates, and, after an unsuccessful effort to storm Mesbid Ali, he reached Meshid Hussein, took the town by storm, and massacred large numbers of the garrison and inhabitants. He also destroyed the tomb of Hussein with all the fanaticism of a Wahabi, and then returned to Nejd. 15. In 1803, Abdullah determined on the conquest of Hejaz, which at ,j• that time was under the rule of Ghalib, Capture of Mecca and Medtna, 1803^14, g herif of Meooa- JV years, Ghaleb had shown a hostile feeling against the Wahabis, and bad endeavoured to excite the Turkish Government to put down their rule in Nejd. The expedition of Abdullah against Hejaz proved successful. He captured the sacred town of Mecca, and not only massacred the garrison, but many of the most venerated Sherifs and Syuds. He destroyed every vestige of superstition, and restored the Kaaba to the naked purity of Islam. He enjoined punctual attendance at public prayers, and strictly forbade the use of silk and tobacco, according to the rules of Wahabism. He prohibited alike Sunnis and Sbiahs from en tering Mecca, unless they paid a suitable tribute in money, and furnished a factory testimonial of their orthodoxy. Even the sister of the Sultan of Turkey was sent back from the Meccan frontier 'with sorrow and shame' before she had kissed the black stone. In 1804, Abdullah marched against Medina, which he captured with ease, and then destroyed the tomb of the Prophet, and carried away all the jewels and pearls and manuscripts of the Koran which had been deposited there ; and in like manner he destroyed the tombs of the Sunni saints, including those of Abubeker and Omar. He then carried fire and sword beyond his northern frontier, but meantime a formidable revolt broke out in the province of Hareek on his southern fron tier. Abdullah hastened with his trustiest vassals to put down the rising, which was at length only suppressed by wholesale destruction and massacre. In the town of Hoota he burnt down every house and butchered every man and child ; so that out of a male population of ten thousand only a hundred and thirty are said to have escaped the sword.

The growing influence of the Wahabis justly alarmed the Persian and Turkish Governments, who offered to unite with Maskat in repelling the common danger. At this juncture, however, several of the principal Chiefs of Oman were induced to array their influence on the side of the Waha bis under a compact which recognized their independence of Maskat. Cut off from all support, except what he derived from Mekran and the coun try westward of Maskat, the Imam was compelled to make peace with the Wahabis on their own terms. 18. In the year 1804, the Imam of Maskat was killed in a battle with —, . , . . 7 . . 7^ i v. the Uttubis.

To oppose his pretensions they entrusted the care of the Government to their cousin Syud Beder, This person had during the late Imam's life time allied himself to the Wahabis, and he now called in their aid, by which, for the first time, they were enabled to obtain a firm footing in Maskat. By the help of the Wahabis, Syud Beder reduced the rebellious Syud Ghes to submission, and recovered possession of Bunder Abbas and Ormuz, both of which places had been seized by the Chief of Kishm. In his expedition to Bunder Abbas and Ormuz, Syud Beder was accompanied by the Hesident, Captain Seton, with two of the Company's cruisers. Our Marine was at this time actively engaged in putting down the Joasmi pirates, who had a short time before captured the Shannon and Trimmer. In 1806 a combined British and Mas kat fleet proceeded to Kishm and successfully blockaded the Joasmis, when they sued for terms. This led to the conclusion of the Treaty with the Joasmi tribe dated the 6th February 1806. 19. During the next two years the supineness of the Persian and Turkish Complete ascendancy of the wahaiis in Oman. Governments, and the weakness arising from the disputed succession in Maskat, enabled the Wahabis completely to establish their ascendancy in Oman. v.—(1) The JkoWi pirates under Wahabi influence first venture into the Indian Seas- (2) Expedition against Joasmis and Wahabis, 1809—1813. 20. In 1808 the Wahabi power rose to its height. They held the revenues of the upper part of Oman, and ruled over the powerful tribe of the Joas- mis to the exclusion of their own Chief, who was compelled to abandon his country. It was under this influence that the Joasmis ventured to extend their, piratical depredations to the Indian Seas, an object long contemplated by the Wahabis. 21. It was now apprehended that the Maskat State would be drawn into the general system of piracy which prevailed in the Gulf unless relieved from the pressure employed by the Wahabis to reduce it. The Arab Sheikhs chafed at the tyranny and insults of the Wababi Officers, and only waited for a signal to re-unite under the Imam's standard. Taking advantage of the absence of the Wahabi Chief on a visit to Mecca in 1809, the Imam fitted out an expedition in which the Uttubis and a party of the Joasmis offered to join against the common enemy. The expedition sailed down the Gulf under the personal command of Syud Saeed, but it terminated with out accomplishing anything. 22. The Resident, Captain Seton, represented that nothing but the interfe rence of the British Government could prevent the destruction of Maskat as a port of commerce, and its shipping being added to the resources of the pirates—an opinion in which Captain (afterwards Sir J.) Malcolm entirely concurred. Influenced by these considerations the Supreme Government determined on despatching an armament to the Gulf for the suppression of piracy, as weli as for the protection of Maskat. The armament proceeded in the first place\ 3 to the Pirate ports, and after operating successfully against Eas-ul-kliyma, Linga and Luft, repaired to Maskat. On being joined by the Imam's forces, an expedition was directed against the important position of Shinas, which, after a sanguinary and heroic defence on the part of the Wahabi Officer, was surrendered to the British and made over to our ally. The armament then returned to Bombay. 23. The British Government had at all times desired to observe a strict „... j ut -rrr t t• neutrality towards the Wahabis.

Captain Seton was instructed ' to be careful to make it in due time fully known to the Wababi, and all the Officers of his Government, that it was our sincere wish to continue at all times on terms of friendship with him and the other States of Arabia, desiring only to provide for the secu rity of the general commerce of the Seas, and of the Gulf of Persia in particular, so long and so unjustifiubly interruped by the Joasmis, in breach also of a positive Treaty con cluded with their Chief in lb06 ; the motives and objects of interposition involving no views of aggrandizement on our part, but being altogether limited to the repression of Maritime depredations, such as is equally condemned by the professors of every religion, and the just support of our ally, the Imam of Maskat, cannot reasonably give offence to any other State or Government/' 24. Soon after the withdrawal of our armament from the Persian Gulf, ^ ^ the Wahabis again appeared in the vici- Wahaois again appear m Oman. . • i if mty ot Maskat, committing devastations of all kinds. The Imam appealed to the British Government for assistance, urging that his co-operation with us in the late expedition had involved him in perpetual warfare with the Wahabi Chief. The Supreme Govern ment, however, considered it impracticable to render any assistance without making it appear that we were united in a contest against the Wahab power which was contrary to our repeatedly declared policy. 25. The Wahabi Chief had at this time entered into a correspondence Letter of the Honourable Jonathan Lunean to the w ith the Resident at Bushire. having Wahahi Chief. „ j , i .• -i , i a. d. 1810. reference to the operations lately under taken for the punishment of the Joasmis. On this correspondence being submitted to the Bombay Government, the Honourable Mr. Duncan was induced to address the Wahabi Chief in the following terms (letter dated the 9th August 1810):— ' The British Government receives with satisfaction the expression of your desire to maintain with it the relations of amity and concord—a desire in which it cordially participates and has uniformly manifested. It is, therefore, proper that I should assure you that the late expedition to the Persian Gulf did not originate in hostility towards you, but was, as above noticed, directed solely to the destruction of the pirates who had in direct breach of their own positive engagements, and with an entire forgetfulness of the former instances of condescend ing lenity manifested towards them, long infested the seas in that quarter, plundering vessels and murdering subjects of all nations indiscriminately, for the British Government does not concern itself with the hostilities carried on by you against the members of the Mussulman faith, on account of their alleged deviation from the ordinances of the Koran, and its power will alone be directed against those who, exercising the detestable profession of piracy, are the common enemies of all nations. ' The channel of communication between us being now open, I request you will continue to afford me the pleasure of hearing of your prosperity and success/' 26. In April 1811 the Wahabi troops appeared in the vicinity of Maskat, Wahaiis invade Oman. attacking and plundering the possession of the Imam. The Imam represented on this occasion to the Bombay Government that his co-operation with his friends and allies, the English, in the late expedition had involved him in a perpetual and implacable war with the Wahabis, with whom he was before at peace* and trusted that the British Government would not remain neutral during the struggle which he w 7 as making to defend his possessions and capital from the invasion of an ancient and inveterate enemy whose resentment had thua been strongly re-excited against him.8 26-A. But the Supreme Government answered the Imam that it was un necessary to regulate his reply to any overtures on the part of the Wahabis by reference to his connection with the British Government, which had always con sidered itself to be at peace with that tribe, the late co-operation with the Imam not having been in prosecution of war against the Wahabis generally, but mere ly for the extirpation of the pirates, whose augmented power and audacity had endangered the security of his own dominions, as well as interrupted the commerce and navigation of the Gulf; that the British Government, therefore, was no further interested in the contest between him and the Wahabis than it was solicitous for the welfare and prosperity of the Imam. Under the influence of that solicitude, and a just sense of the benefits and blessings of a state of peace, it was recommended to the Imam to grant the terms of pacifi cation solicited by the Wahabis if consistent with the honour and security of the State of Maskat. VL—First Egyptian invasion of Nejd, 1814—1819. 27. The relief, however, which we were indisposed to afford came at this Subversion of the wdhahi 'power ly the Turkish time to the Imam indirectly, and from Government. an unexpected quarter, namely, from Egypt. Soon after the appointment of Mahomed Ali as Pasha of Egypt in 1813, his energetic and skilful character made its influence felt throughout his Pashalic. He directed early attention to the Hejaz, which was then held by one of the sons of the Wahabi Chief and entering that province at the head of a large force he compelled the Wahabis to vacate Jeddah and Mecca, and retire within their own frontiers. Alarmed at the determined attitude taken up by the Turkish Government, the Waiiabi Chief sought to conciliate the friendship of the different powers in the Persian Gulf. He made overtures at first to Persia, and then to the Eesident in the Persian Gulf, to form a connection with the British Government of mutual amity and friendship which might be beneficial to both States, and acknowledging the superiority of the British over every other nation at sea, proposed that the ports of each State should be open to each other, and a free and unmolested trade carried on by their subjects. The Supreme Government, to whom these proposals were submitted, thought it undesirable at that moment to enter into any regular engagement with the Wahabis even of a commercial character, but considered it politic ' to maintain a friendly intercourse with the Wah- habi Chief, and endeavour by cordial and conciliatory conduct to confirm the amicable disposition which he appeared to entertain towards the British Government.' 1 (Letter dated 18th Eebruary 1814i.) 28. An Envoy was about the same time deputed by the Wahabi Chieftain visit of a Wahabi Envoy to Maskat—j. p. to Maskat, who announced his arrival at that place to the Bombay Govern ment, with the object of restoring ' the relations of amity between the two powers/' In reply Sir Evan Nepean wrote— ' Entertaining, as I have always done, the most friendly disposition towards your master I conceived it my duty, even previously to the receipt of your letter, to instruct iMr. Bruce, the British Resident at Bushire,to communicate with His Highness Saud bin Abdul Aziz, and to establish such an amicable intercourse with him as cannot fail to be equally advantageous to both countries, as well as for the general benefit of their respective neighbours, and it is with feelings of particular satisfaction I have observed your Excellency has stated that a correspond ing desire is sincerely entertained by His Highness Saud bin Abdul Aziz, and I shall there- fore, look forward with confidence to the speedy attainment of our reciprocal wishes.' 29.

In 1819 the Turks under Ibrahim Pasha, following up their successes 1 Fall of the Wahabi Capital of 2) e riah~A.

The inhabitants of the ill-fated city were at the same time removed to Ilasa which it was determined to establish as the future capital of this part of Arabia under the Beni-Khalid tribe. The Turkish troops then marched towards the shores of the Persian Gulf, intending as it was understood to retaliate upon the piratical tribes for their lawless and sanguinary proceedings towards the subjects of the Porte. 31. The Supreme Government bad for some time contemplated an expedi- Seoond British expedition against the Joasmis tlOU OU a large SCale against the Joasmi under General Keir—A.D. 1820. pirates, and on hearing of the arrival of the Turkish Army on the Arabian Coast the Govern or-General resolved on communicating with Ibrahim Pasha for the purpose of learning whether the Naval and Military forces at the command of the Bombay Government could be applied in conjunction with the Turkish Army for the complete reduction of the Joasmis. Captain Sadlierwas entrusted with the delivery of the Governor- General's despatch to Ibrahim Pasha. An account of his mission, and the journey he undertook to accomplish has been published. 32. The British expedition sailed from Bombay under the command of General Keir about the end of 1819, and, with the co-operation of the Imam of Maskat, destroyed or captured all the vessels and the principal strongholds of the piratical Chieftains. The dread inspired by the success of the British arms in the reduction of Ras-ul-khyma led to the more powerful Arab Sheikhs sending offers of unqualified submission to General Keir. On the 8th January 1820 a general Treaty of Peace was concluded with nearly all the Chiefs of the Maritime Arabs in the Gulf, the provisions of which have since been more or less respected. 33. The Amir Abdullah was sent prisoner to Constantinople and there ^ Amir Abdullah sent prisoner to Constantinople decapitated.

VII. Eesurrection of the Wahabis under Turki, 1824—1830. 34. But M j . Warden's anticipation was by no means realised. There was _ , , _ , plenty of vitality remaining in the sect, Reconstruction of the Wahahi Kingdom. 3 n, . _ c tt , ,. , . J and after six years of Egyptian dorm* nation a general insurrection was headed by the son of the late Amir, Turki bin Abdullah, or as he is more commonly called, Turki bin Saud. The Egyptian Governor was compelled to fall back on Kasim, and Turki was unanimously proclaimad Sultan of Nejd and restorer of the Wahabi power. The restor ation of Deriah was neither practicable nor desirable ; so Turki fixed on the neighbouring town of Riadh as his capital and fortified it. These events happened in 1824, and Wahabism from that time entered on a fresh career of aggressive expansion. Turki soon opened a correspondence with all the Sheikhs on the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf, inviting them to renew the relations which had subsisted between them prior to the overthrow of the Wahabis by Ibrahim Pasha. As a consequence of this overture Sheikh Sultan bin Saggar, the Chief of the Joasmis, in November 1825 brought to the notice of the British authority in the Persian Gulf his ' great alarm at the increasing power and in trigues of the Wahabis,' and professed himself very anxious to learn whether he might look to the English for assistance in the event of his endeavouring to maintain his independence.10 ' In reply, he was informed, in general terms, that he was the best judge of his own interests; but that no connection or authority would be received by the British Government as an excuse for any proceedings bearing a predatory character. The Sheikh then adverted to the very difficult dilemma into which he would be cast in the event o£ Wahabis attacking the territories of the Imam, and calling on him for his support against that Prince. To this he was answered, that his forming any connection prejudicial to His Highness would be considered unfriendly by us, and it was in every point of view advisable that he should not adopt that line of conduct. The language held on this occasion was confirmed by the Governor in Council, with a further intimation, that however improbable it might be that we should act against the Wahabis so long as they confined their conquests to the shore, it was still not desirable that we should bind ourselves to abstain from interposition, or hold out so great an encouragement to the invasion of the Imam^s territories as our avowed inditference would be likely to afford.' 35. The following five or six years were occupied by Turk! in reconstruct ing his father's kingdom, and in recovering one after another the provinces formerly subject to Wahabi rule. At the same time he endeavoured to conciliate the Pasha of Egypt by the payment of a small annual tribute. In 1831 his recovery of Basa and Katif so alarmed the Imam of Maskat, that that Chief was fain to be taken under his protection on the terras of acknow ledging his supremacy and paying an annual tribute. And thus the whole of the Arabian Coast from Ras-ul-Hud to Koweit (with the exception of Abu- thabi) became tributary to the Wahabis | :• VIII.—Overtures to British G-overnment, 1831. 33. About the middle of the year 1831 a communication was made to the Governor of Bombay by the Wahabi Chief, through Sheikh Rashid bin Humid of Ajman, expressive of his desire to be upon the same intimate footing as that formerly existing between the British Government and his ancestor Sand and ' to have the treaty renewed which was made between you the British and Imam Saud'. To this a reply in general but friendly terms was transmitted through the Ilesident in the Persian Gulf. 37. With reference to this allusion to a Treaty, the Persian Secretary reported that only two documents could be found on the records relatiao- to our intercourse u ith the TV aliabis, viz., those quoted in paragraphs 25 and 28 supra. In acknowledging the communication last received, the Honourable Br. Romer thus addressed the Wahabi Chief : — 'Your communication dated the 25th of J umadyooluwul, informing me that by the Reply of the Bon,bay Government. appointment of the Ruler of Events you had , , , , , , , . arrived at the dignity of Chief of the Wahabi . llas f^ched my hands, and given me the gratification which friends feel when thev receive intelligence from friends. * 'Your disposition to a friendly underetending is met with reciprocal feelin?, and the terms of anutywh.ch existed between this Government and your greal ancestor, Imam Saud will still remain m force and I cherish hopes will never be broken or infriaaed I s?nd thi, letter by the hands of your faithful depeudant, Esa bin Hassan, to express the same IX ' P invasion of Oman.

In 1833, the influence of the Wahabis again became predominant in Oman, and at the invitation of most of the tribes, they marched an armv into the province. The Imam findmg the integrity of his dominions 'rious v menaced considered it his best policy to form a closer connection with tie Wababi Chief. It was accordingly agreed by him to pay a tribute of 5 000 German crowns per annum to the Wahabi Chief, that each should hnld possession of his own coast according to the limits then existing t l r . extending to Jalaam, and the Wahabi's to Katif; and fuXr f^^o. f was entered into binding them reciprocally to assist in putting down anfS lions arising in their respective territories. ^ rebel- 39. On these circumstances being reported to the Bombay Government question arose as to whether the subversion of the newer of tl,; T™!™ T™ ' , would be adverse to British interests in the oKd ^ not a c aim on the British Government for protection. The question 'havin? I. t p^ua:ri83i!' e '' jl ' evel]r ' n '' lelter '!i een referred to Calcutta, the Supreme Government * intimated11 ' The Right Hon'ble the Oovernor-General in Council is not prepared to sanction the employment of the British arms for the purpose of maintaining the integrity of the continen tal possessions of the Imam of Maskat. If we were once to commit ourselves by a declaration of our intention to support that Chief, this line of p licy must be followed up at any expense, and it is impossible to set limits to the waste of blood and treasure which might ensue in consequence. &lt;t Wahabis evidently exist in considerable force, and the Imam has acknowledged their ascendancy by entering into tributary engagements with them, and engaging to hold his forces at their disposal for carrying on offensive operations against their enemies. If both parties are left to themselves, a sense of mutual interest will probably lead them to abstain from carrying to extremity auy differences that may hereafter arise between them, whereas if we were to make an offer of military assistance to the Imam, he would probably avail himself of the support of our alliance to rid himself of the burden of the connection^ which lie has been forced to enter into with the Wahabis, and we should become involved in a series of distressing operations, carried on at a distance from our resources and under great disadvan tages from the heat of the climate and the nature of the country, against a brave people with whom we have ourselves no cause of dispute of any kind. ' Our concern is only with the maritime commerce of the Gulf, and as long as that is not molested it matters not to us whether one power or another holds dominion on its shores. Even if the Wahabis were to get possession of the harbour of Maskat, an event, of which the Imam himself does not appear to entertain any apprehension, it does not of necessity follow that they would commence a system of piracy. It is mc e probable that, being already sensible, from their recollection of past events in the Gulf, of our maritime superiority, they would dread to provoke us, and, as they would, under the circumstances supposed, have taken their place as a substantive power in that quarter, that they would be glad to continue the same friendly connection with us which has always subsisted between us and the Imam. ' It is believed that the Joasmis and other Arab tribes in the Wahabi interest are even now possessed of establishments in the Gulf, but we do not hear of any piracies being com mitted by them. They are probably restrained by the fear of our well-known ability to punish them, and this salutary dread would be likely to have even a greater influence over their con duct than it ha^ at present, after they become possessed of a, port like Maskat with a flourish- ino- trade and other interests at stake which they must sacritice by provoking hostility with us. t) « Bnt even if the worst contingency that can be supposed likely to take place were actually to happen, and the Wahabis were not only to acquire possession of the port of Maskat, but also to commit acts of piracy upon the Gulf trade, it is conceived that it would be much cheaper and easier to chastise them under these circumstances than to take up the question in its pre- eent state and constitute ourselves the guardians of the possessions of the Imam of Maskat against all his enemies. In the former case the whole extent of our operations would be comprised in such measures as might be deemed most advisable for the purpose of putting down piracy, while in the latter we might become engaged in a system of continental warfare, the final result of which it would be impossible to foresee. In the former case we should know exactly how far we should be committed, we should engage with all the advantage arising from our maritime superiority, and, under Providence, success would certainly attend our efforts ; while in the latter we should abanrlon our vantage ground to fight the Wahabis in their own country, we should unnecessarily provoke the hostility of a free and powerful people, and should be involved in difficulties from which we could not retreat with honor. ' On the whole His Lordship in Council considers it fortunate that it has been so clearly established by the result of former discussions that we are not under arty defensive engage ments with the Imam of Maskat, and it is requested that the British Authorities in the Gulf may be instructed to observe a strict neutrality in any disputes that may arise between him • and any of his neighbours on the Continent of Arabia. From a reference to the 15th paragraph of Mr. Warden's memorandum, dated i7th February 1826, it will be observed that this line of policy is in strict accordance with that which was prescribed by the Supreme Government when the Imam solicited our aid against the Wahabis after the expedition against the Joasmi pirates in 180S, on the plea that owing to the assistance he afforded us on that occasion they (the Wahabis) threatened to overwhelm him. At present so far from entertaining such an apprehension, he appears to rely with a considerable degree of confidence on his Treaty with them, and the main purport of his communication to Mr. Blanc was to enquire how he was to act in case they called upon him to engage in hostile measures against neighbour ing States. Mr. Blane's answer vas marked by great judgment, and it is hoped that if the Imam adopts the prudent course recommended to him by that gentleinan, he will not be subjected to any serious difficulty from his connection with his new Allies.' X-—(1) Turki murdered by Meshari- (2) Meshari executed by Fey sal- (3) Fey sal assumes the kingdom, 1834:. 40. But the difficulty in winch the Imam and we as his allies were in volved was almost immediately solved by the occurrence of events in Kejd, which effectually diverted the 'Wahabis from schemes of foreign invasion. Turki in 1834 was assassinated by his nephew Meshari, and the murderer usurped the government.12 41. This usurpation, however, was shortlived ; it lasted only until Turlsi's son Feysal, who at the time was conducting military operations near Katif in Hasa, could return to Riadh. Meshari was then executed, and Eeysal suoceeded his father as Sultan of Nejd. 42. Feysal was about 34 years of age. He at once applied himself to restore order in the central provinces, where recent events had thrown every thing into confusion. XI.—(1) Second Egyptian invasion. (2) British pressure compels the Egyptians to withdraw, 1836—1840. 43. Very small leisure tiowever was allowed him for this task. In 1836 a large Egyptian force was assembled at Medina, and Feysal was summoned as a vassal to bring in a contingent of troops to the Egyptian General. Eeysal evaded this demand ; but when he found the following year that the preten sions of a rival Prince, his cousin Khalid, were about to be forcibly taken up by the Egyptians, he made a tender of full submission. It was too late. The Egyptian General, with the pretender Khalid in his wake, advanced into Nejd and after a battle near Riadh became master of the country. In December 1838 Hasa and Katif were added to the Egyptian conquests, and Feysal, having surrendered himself to Khurshed Paslia, was sent a prisoner to Egypt. Khurshed Pasha now threw off the cloak afforded by Khalid's claims to the throne, and declared Nejd an appanage of Egypt. 44. The Eoreign Office has some bulky records of this period relating to affairs in Arabia, but there is little in them of value with reference to the purposes of this Precis. For the Wahabis had now been swallowed up by the Egyptian power, and therefore not only was the attention of the Indian Government concentrated on the Egyptians only, but its policy became coloured by exclu sively European considerations. Lord Palmerston was at that time triump hantly carrying through, in the teeth of France as administered by M. Thiers, his determination to reduce Mahomed Ali, the too powerful Pasha of Egypt, to a proper subordination as vassal of the Porte. 45. Instead therefore of viewing the downfall of Wahabi fanaticism and the rise of semi-civilised Egypt in its stead with any of that indifference or complacency which, if the event could be repeated, might now perhaps be felt, the Indian Government omitted no effort of diplomacy to counteract, the pro gress of the Egyptian Generals. The Resident in the Persian Gulf entered a formal protest against the proceedings of Khurshed Pasha, and took written engagements from the maritime Chiefs of Oman that they would sedulously cultivate their relations with the British Government, abide by its wishes and instructions, and above all resist to the last extremity all attempts of Khurshed Pasha to subjugate them. It was even seriously in contemplation to blockade the Arabian ports in the Persian Gulf held by Egyptian troops, when at last the strong remonstrances addressed to Mahomed Ali by Her Britannic Majesty's Consul-General at Cairo were found to have had their- effect, and in May 1840 the Egyptians evacuated Nejd. The Amir Khalid, however, was left behind as Vali of the province. XII.—Government of Khalid as Turkish Vicegerent, 1840—41. 46. It is noticeable that Khalid accepted this office by direct appointment from the Sublime Porte ; for it was at this juncture and in this way that the Turkish Government first came forward as claimant to ail the rights of sover eignty in Central Arabia acquired by the conquests of its Lieutenant, Mahomed Ali, and his Egyptian troops. In allowing this arrangement Khurshed Pasha seems to have intended that Khalid 7 s Government should be carried on under control from an Egyptian Agent to be established at Medina. 47. Khalid's short rule is marked by two occasions of contact with the British Government. In the first instance, he addressed a very friendly letter to the British Native Agent at Bahrein, expressing an earnest desire to renew the amicable and cordial relations which formerly subsisted between his-SFeat- x L J^- father, Saud, and the British Government, hinting that he had wished before to open the correspondence, but had been prevented by his Egyptiani ' 13 masters. And secondly, in October 1841 a report having arisen that he con templated the invasion of Oman, a British Officer was deputed to visit him at his camp in Hasa, seventy miles from the coast, who obtained from him an assurance that he had no such intention. Indeed, Khalid bad no power to to meditate foreign invasion. Deprived of the Egyptians, he was quite unable to fy- hold his own in Nejd. XIII.— Abdullah-bin-Suneyan seizes the kingdom.

Abdullab-bin-Suneyan or Thaneyyan, a distant cousin of Kahlid, enter ing the lists against him, after a short and uneventful contest succeeded in wrest ing his power from him, and becoming fully acknowledged as Euler of the Wahabis. This happened in February 1842. 49. The new Ruler had been just a year installed in authority, when Eeysal re-appeared in Arabia having somehow effected an escape or a release from Egyptian captivity. The Nejdeana flocked to the standard of the rightful Prince, and in June 1843 Abdullah-bin-Suneyan was forced to surrender at discretion. and XIV.—(1) Oman threatened. (2) British Policy, 184:3—184:5. 50. In July 1843 Feysal sent a messenger with letters to the maritime and inland Sheikhs of Oman, intimating his intentioo. of sending an army under Syud -bin-Mutluk, on the termination of the hot weather, for the purpose of bringing that province under his authority. In consequence of this threat the Chiefs of the inland fort of Beraymi applied for the aid of the British Govern ment. ' They were informed, in reply, that the communications formerly entered into with them by the Britisli Government had reference solely to the advance of the Egyptian troops, and the connection subsisting between His Hig-hue^s Mohammed Ali Pasha with Nejd ; but that these circumstances being now altogether changed, and the impending dan ger removed by the departure of the troops under Khnrshed Pasha from that province, it wa' now the intention of the British Government to withdraw from all interference in the internal affairs of Arabia/'' 51. At this very time too the Resident received a communication from the Amir himself expressive of a desire for Feysai s paciuc overtmcs. the renewal of the amicable relations which had existed between his father, Turld, and the British Government. Proper response was made to this demonstration of amity, and the Amir was further informed that the sole object of the British Government in this quarter was the suppression of plunder and bloodshed on the seas, and the security of all well-disposed inhabitants on the shores of the Gulf. 52. In September 1843 the Bombay Government (at that time headed by Sir George Arthur) enquired of the Gov- Brltish view of big proceedings. i iri* V i u ernment ot India what policy should be pursued towards Eeysal. The Bombay Government considered that as long as the Chief remained within his former possessions no interference would be neces sary, but it nevertheless doubted whether he should be allowed to obtain a prepon derating influence at Bahrein and with the Arab Chiefs who were under treaty engagements to us. To this reference the Governor General (LordEllenborough) in Council replied simply that it was ' not at present necessary or expedient to interfere with the proceedings of the Chief.' 53. In December the same year Amir Feysal interposed in a quarrel between two rival claimants for the Chief- Wahabi interference at Bahrein. . e -n i ii* j ai , ship of Bahrein, and having secured the victory for his own protege^ appropriated the fort of Demaum as the reward of his assistance. 54. On the 26th August 1844 the Bombay Government renewed its _ . enquiry 'as to the policy which should be Britisb Policy. j * xi, x- ' i. pursued m the now certain event of Amir Eeysal, the legitimate Wahabi Ruler, extending his authority over the Chiefs of Oman, and especially if he endeavoured to effect this object by sea.'*It was pointed out that Feysal's proceedings might ultimately endanger our relations with Oman and the maritime Arab Chiefs, and so tend to resumption of piracy. And the letter concluded as follows :— It does not therefore appear to the Governor in Council unworthy of consideration whether the Resident in the Persian Gulf should not at once endeavour to effect an arrange* ment with Amir Feysal, ratifying and securing existing engagements at sea. In other words, that, as the price of forbearance on the part of the British Government, this Chief should become a party to its maritime engagements, whereby commercial interests may be secured. ' As the not improbable event of the Wahahi Ruler encroaching on the possessions of His Hi ghness the Imam of Maskat, an old ally of the British Government, is a contingency which ought to be provided for, this Government is desirous of being favoured with the sentiments of the Right Hon'ble the Governor General in Council on this point.^ 55. No official reply was issued to this application, but the view adopted by the Government of India was evidently that suggested in Lord Hardinge's brief remark on the back of the letter, —' No case for interference has arisen.' i 56. Early in the year 1845 S yud-bin-Mutluk came to Beraymi from Nejd and at once all the neighbouring Arab tribes, inspired perhaps as much by fear of Wahabi arms as sympathy with Wahabi tents, vied with each other in tender ing their allegiance to Feysal's representative. Elated with greater success than he had expected, Syud-bin-Mutluk ravaged the territories of the Sohar Chief, seized the fort of Mujees, butchering all its garrison, and compelled the Chief to consent to a very heavy tribute. Be at the same time demanded a large tribute from Maskat, and was preparing to enforce the request by invasion, At this juncture the Bombay Government again addressed the Government of India, enquiring what was to be done if the Imam asked for our help against the Wahabis. The Government of India replied on May 6th in the following terms :— 41 It would appear that Feysal-bin-Turki, in whose name and on whose behalf the present expedition of Syud bin-Mutluk has been undertaken, has not hitherto don« more than endeavour tore-establish the Wahabi supremacy as it existed in the time of his father, Turki- bin-Saud, before the Egyptian aggression reduced the Wahabi power and that it is the opinion of Major Hennel that our interests with respect to the maritime Arabs are likely to suffer by Syud-bin-Mutluk's proceedings. If therefore the mere establishment of the Wahabi power in Oman and the reception of the willing allegiance of the maritime Chiefs whom on a former occasion we took under our protection and encouraged to resistence were to be the only remit of the present expedition of Syud-bin- Viutluk, the Governor General in Council would see no occasion to modify the opi-nion given in the letter from this office of 7th October 1843, that our interference is not called for ; but if it appear to be the purpose of Feysal-bin-Turki to extend the Wahahi supremacy beyond former limits and to encroach upon the possessions of our ally, the Imam of Ma-kat, or if the result of these proceedings are found detrimental to our relations with the maritime Arabs and our measures for the suppression of piracy, a case for our interference will, in the opinion of the Governor General in Council, arise, and it may be perhaps desirable in such case for you to instruct the local authorities to declare to Fuysal-bin-Turki that our forbearance, from which he may have hitherto taken some encouragement, will be extended no further, and that we can not countenance or allow wanton aggression on the territories of our ancient ally. The Governor General in Council is disposed to think that the explicit expression of our feelings on this subject will be sufficient to cause the Wahabi Chief to desist from active operations, should they be contemplated, against the Maskat district, or that, at any rate, a demonstration by sea by the force now in the Gulf will produce the desired effect. On this subject the local Government of Bombay will be better able to form a judgment than the Governor General in Council. The Governor General in Council, however, wishes it to be understood that he would not, on the one hand, commit the Government at the present moment to a line of policy which would be likely to involve the necessity of detaching troops to the Gulf, nor would he, on the other, make to the Wahabi Chief or his agent Syud-biu-Mutluk a threat which he would not be prepared fully to carry out. If therefore the Bombay Government consider that a mere declaration of our views or naval operations alone will in all probability effect what is desired, the Governor General in Council authorizes the Bombay Government to instruct the local authorities accordingly; but if on this subject His Honor in Council entertains doubt, he is requested to refer to us a^ain with a fuU exposition of the views and opinions of the Bombay Government for the further instructions of the Government of India .15 57. As a result apparently of this correspondence, the Indian Nary made a strong demonstration off the Batina Eesult of the invasion. ^ ^ Besideilt in til6 Persian Gulf addressed forcible remonstrances both to Peysalat Biadhand to his Lieute nant at Beraymi. These measures proved successful; satisfactory replies were received from the Wahabis, and the storm blew oyer. The Maskat Government agreed to pay Eeysal an annual tribute of 5,000 crowns'; 2,000 crowns were also given as a present to Syud-bin-Mutluk, and for these considerations the Wahabis evacuated the fort of Mujees and retired. Beraymi still remained in Wahabi occupation, but Syud-bin-Mutluk's popularity among the neighbouring Arabs was short-lived, and his position there became frequently one of danger. XV.—Wahabi attempt on Bahrein, 1847—1851. 58. During the seven years succeeding the events just noticed, the only instances of Wahabi aggression in the direction of the Persian Gulf appear to be two displays of pressure on the Chief of Bahrein, the first in U4 j 7, and the second in 1851. On the latter occasion the Resident in the Persian Gulf acting upon what he believed to be the wish of Her Majesty s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, despatched the entire Persian Gulf Squadron to Bahrein with instructions to interfere forcibly, if necessary. And the step was a salutary one, for without it Bahrein would certainly have fallen into Feysal's grasp : as it was, Feysal found himself obliged to make peace with the Chief. It seems too as if from this time forward Eeysal adopted a much more conciliatory tone in the not unfrequent communications that followed between himself and the Besident. 59. A letter of this period from the Resident is of some interest as showing the designs upon Arabia then entertained by either the Ottoman Porte or, as is more probable, Abbas Pasha, the half-crazy debauchee who succeeded Mahomed Ali in Egypt. Colonel Hennell speaks of the probable acquisition of Bahrein by the Wahabis as being tantamount to its acquisition by the^ Porte» and justifies this assertion by the following considerations the Amir pays a regular tribute to the Turkish Government; there are accredited envoys from Abbas Pasha in the Amir's camp; the Wahabi Agent at Koweit (a Turkish port) passes himself off as an envoy from the Pasha of Eg^pt; there are emissaries along the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf; and Turkish steamers are in course of equipment for service in the Gulf. XVI.—Invasion of Oman lay AMullali son of Feysal—Treaty between Mashat and the Wahabis, 1852-1863. 60. In 1852 during the absence of the Imam of Maskat in his African possessions, and while his incompetent son, Syud Thoweyni (the present Imam), was conducting the Government of Maskat, the Wahabis once more appeared in threatening force on the frontier. The time was well chosen; for there were disturbances and dissensions throughout all the Maskat territoi y, especially in Batinah, where the Imam had recently seized the Chiefship of Sohar under circumstances of singular treachery. The V) ahabi leader, who this time was Feysal's son and heir-apparent, Abdullah, ' came in the character of arbiter and redresser of wrongs suffered by his children (the Sheikhs) in Oman. He took up his position at Beraymi and summoned the Chiefs to attend him.' , As on the former occasion, the Arab tribes flocked to pay him their allegiance and offer service. Abdullah at once ' sent forth demands for the _ immediate cession of Sohar and the payment of tribute so large in amount that it was plain he sought but a pretext, in the refusal that must of necessity follow, to attack andlay waste the districts of Batinah.' The state of Maskat was indeed in imminent peril. But now the British Resident appeared on the scene, and by dint of calling the Joasmi Chief sharply to order, remonstrating with Abdullah, and sending a vessel of war to cruise along the Arabian Coast, he enabled Syud Thoweyni to enter into negotiations with the invader. The result was a Treaty of alliance offensive and defensive between the two parties, &lt;( whereby the Maskat Government agreed to pay to the ahabi Amir an annual tributeof 12,000 crowns, besides arrears to the extent of 60,000 orowns, and the usual supply of provisions and stores. The Wahabi likewise pledged himself to assist His Excellency in every hour of difficulty, and the boundaries of the dominions of either remained as heretofore.'' XVIL—Teysal's nominal dependence on Turkey, 1855. 61. The next record of any interest is dated January 1853. The Resident having found it necessary to point out to Peysal that the British Govern ment regarded the Arab tribes on the coast as independent powers, Eeysal replied as follows :— ' With regard to what you observe that engagements have existed between the Chiefs of the coast of Oman and the Resident for a period of -30 years, this is well known to me, their object being to guard against the occurrence of irregularities and the harbouring of disorderly characters, nought else. This is an arrangement of which I quite approve on the part of Residents, both those who have gone before, and those who come after, for there is an under standing between us and the British Government of 100 years duration for the security of traders and travellers passing on the seas. The coasts o? Oman, however, and the territories thereof appertain to the Peninsula of Arabia under my control, and acknowledging my authority. Further the people of the districts in the interior of Oman and at the seats of the Bedouin tribes are more powerful than, and have the command over the inhabitants of the coast and could not be restrained from preying upon ^nd slaughtering them, but that I maintain a Lieutenant with a force in Oman, who holds them back from the people of the coast. These last are well assured of his protection; otherwise, were they abandoned to their fate, they could not subsist. Moreover, when owing to their negligence, disagreements, too long to be detailed, and bloodshed have arisen between some of the Chief's of the coasts aforesaid, there was none could check them and restore order and good will among them, except the Lieutenant in charge of Oman, whose office is among the things pleasing to God and bis Prophet, as also to the Sultan of the faithful—may God strengthen the faith by his means. Being a dependant of the exalted Turkish Government, I hold the confirmation of the Sultan to my continuance in authority over all the Arabs. To exemplify this, when Mahomed Ali Pasha, having projected his schemes against Basrah and Mohammerah and the territory pertaining thereto, enter taining designs upon India, deputed his envoy t« me, proposing to hold me dearer and more cherished than his own sons, to induce me to forward his views with respect to the coast of Oman and elsewhere within the Peninsula of Arabia, and to offer no hindrance or opposition—for of others, besides the Arabs, he took no account owing to his exalted dignity— I replied, 'you know that I am a dependant of the Sultan of tho Faithful from whom if you possess orders to that effect let me be informed of them ; otherwise the thing is impossible/ Thereon war broke out between me and him, which lasted two years, and intelligence thereof duly reached the Sublime Porte, and they (the Sultan's Government) greatly rejoiced, and were much pleased with me and my influence and consideration with them increased exceedingly. May God perpetuate their rule and the glory of their State'. 6^. In. writing in this strain Feysal's object apparently was twofold; first to put forward a general claim to lordship over the whole of Arabia; and second, to try whether the affectation of being only the Vicegerent of a European Power might serve to divert the British Government from interference bet ween himself and the maritime Arabs whom he asserted to be his feudatories. XVIIL—Eenewal of Wahabi attempt on Bahrein—British inter ference, 1859—1861. 63. After a silence of nearly fWe years our records resume mention of the Wahabis. Eeysal this time re-appears in his old character as partisan of the 7 &gt; refugee Sheikh of Bahrein (Mahomed bin Abdullah) against the de facto Chief (Mahomed bin Khalifa) with the design of appropriating Bahrein to himself. Notwithstanding repeated warnings from the Eesident, and solemn assurances of pacific intentions from Eeysal, in defiance even of the presence of a British corvette, extensive preparations for the invasion of Bahrein were made at Katif and Demaum, including the piratical seizure of some Turkish and Persian vessels and the impressment of their crews for service in the pro jected expedition. Hereupon Commodore Balfour with the Persian Gulf Squadron was despatched to the scene of action, and the very threatening attitude assumed by this officer soon induced the Wahabi Governor of Katif to abandon his designs, and humbly sue for pardon. In reporting the Commodore's success, the Resident expressed an opinion that we had borne too long with Eeysal, who, while giving us fair words, still falsified all he saidhy steadily pursuing his fixed object of universal dominion along the coast. He recommended direct reprisals upon the ports from which the recent piracies had been effected the pirates, ' he added, 'of the Eastern Archipelago, of Tunis, Algiers, of Riff, and Salee have all had their visitation, and n humane Government has ever questioned the legality of such reprisals.' There was some correspondence on this occasion between Feysal and the Resident. Feysal, after justifying his proceedings on the ground that the Sheikh of .Bahrein was one of his own feudatories whom for various misdeeds he had a perfect right to chastise, protested against British interference in the following terms:— ' Between the Wahabi Amir and the British Government Treaties have been made by the several authorities, authority after authority ; and, in accord ance with treaties between the 'Wahabi Amir and the Sultan Abdul Mejid, there are matters which every one is precluded from meddling with, unless on special grounds.' To this the Resident replied by declaring that the British Government recognised Bahrein as an independent Chiefship and was prepared to oppose all foreign agency, including that of His Highness the Amir, by every means in its power; he also pointed out the inconsistenoy of Feysal claiming to be dependent upon Turkey at the same time that Feysal's Lieute nant at Katif was committing piracy on vessels bearing the Turkish flag. Upon receipt of the Resident's reports the Resolution adopted by the Govern ment of Bombay and approved by the Government of India, was to insist on the expulsion of the refugee Sheikh Mahomed bin Abdullah from the Wahabi port of Damaum, where for 16 years his incessant intrigues for the recovery of Bahrein had been an element of disquietude extending over a considerable portion of the coast. 61. In June 1861 the Resident in compliance with the Government Resolution above mentioned wrote to Amir Feysal, requiring him to eject Mahomed bin Abdullah, the refugee Sheikh of Bahrein, from Demaum, and recommending him to enter into a peaceable convention with the Sheikh, whom by our recent treaty we had recognised as the rightful ruler of Bahrein. 65. Five months having elapsed without any reply from Feysal, the Re sident in November 1861 again took the Squadron down to Bahrein, and after ' an hour's firing, in which no casualty occurred on either side,' com pelled Mahomed bin Abdullah with all his faction to flee from T)emaum. ' From all I could learn,' writes the Resident, 'the Wahabi authorities and traders on their coast were inwardly pleased at the long pending question being thus settled, although His Highness the Amir could not, with due regard to Arab hospitality, openly compel Sheikh Mahomed bin Abdullah to relinquish the shelter he had offered him. In any case His Highness's castle and garrisons, both at Memaum and Katif, forbore to molest us in any way, and on our part orders were issued to respect them so long as they continued inactive. XIX.-(l) Wahabis ports Attacked. (2) Blockade of Wahabi ports by the Chief of Bahrein. (3) Blockade raised on British interfer ence, 1861. 6 ^ : , . The papers of 1861 show an exceptional state of affairs, the British Government this time interfering to protect not Bahrein from the Wahabis, but the Wahabis from Bahrein. The Sheikh seems somehow to have imbi bed the idea that he could find better alliances for himself than that of Eng land. First he hoisted the Turkish flag ; then he threw himself into the hands of Persia; and finally, in reliance on Persian aid and a vague rumour of French vessels approaching, he proceeded to blockade the ports of his old enemy the Wahabis, harass the trade and pearl fisheries of Demaum and Katif, and enter upon a course of general piracy. These strange proceedings brought the Resident with the whole Gulf Squadron down to Bahrein ; and in the end order was restored, and the Sheikh compelled to enter into a Treaty with the British Government. In this Treaty it was expressly declared that the Sheikh of Bahrein was an independent power. XX—Turkish Protest against British proceedings, 1862. 67. These strong measures elicited a remonstrance from the Turkish Governor General of Baghdad. He wanted to know by what right we had18 borabarded Demfnim, a plaoe which, as lying within the territory of ' Feysal Beg, the Kaunraakam of Nejd,' was ' part of the hereditary dominions of the Sultan.' To which Her Britannic Majesty's Consul-General at Baghdad replied that we had hitherto ' always maintained direct relations with Amir Feysal as well as with all the Chiefs and Principalities situated on the shores of the Persian Gulf'; that our pacific policy in the Gulf was well known, and that in the prosecution of that policy we ' had never acknowledged the autho rity or jurisdiction of any other State—an authority and jurisdiction moreover wiiich assuredly the Porte neither does exercise nor has ever exercised in that quarter.' In reporting this correspondence to Her Britannic Majesty's Am bassador at Constantinople the Consul-General wrote as follows :—• ' Althougli it may not be denied that, since the Egyptian invasion of Nejd in 1839-40, Amir Feysal has remained tributary to the Turkish authorities of Mecca, his tribute being regarded probably as an offering- to the head of the religion it is certain that the Porte has r.ever exercised any jurisdiction, or attempted to extend its authority, over that country. Were it otherwise, were a Turkish administration established capable of controlling the province, restraining the Wahabis and their dependants from the piratical practices for which they were once so notorious, and finally o£ preventing or giving satisfaction for any breach of international law, such a state of things might be as conducive to good order, as it would be certainly less burdensome to the British Government than the maritime surveillance, which, in the interests of commerce, the British Goverment is now compelled to maintain in the Persian Gulf. But in point of fact, the Porte has not the power to punish or coerce its tribu tary ; not a single Turkish functionary exists in the country; and to judge from my own experience of the duties of the British Resident in the Persian Gulf, I feel assured that, were the relations of that officer with the Amir of Nejd to be di.-turbed in a manner to withdraw the Wahahi Coast from his immediate supervision, the effect must be highly prejudicial to the policy which has hitherto obtained under the orders and sanction of Her Majesty's Indian Government in that quarter.' 68. In April 1862 the Resident reported that he was making another and a final effort to effect a peaceable settlement between Amir Jb'eysal and the Chief of Bahrein, but that he much feared open war between the two parties w as inevitable. XXL—(1) Differences between the Sultan of Maskat. (2) Amir of Nejd, 1864—1865. 69. Towards the close of 1864, the Chief of Rostack (whose family had been dispossessed of Sohar in 1849) displayed a hostile spirit towards the Sultan of Maskat and proposed to transfer his allegiance to the Wahabi Chief • Letter No. 277, dated the 3rd December under certain conditions of tribute payment. 1864 ' Colonel Disbrowe reported* to Government on the 3rd December 1864, that the Sultan had engaged in an expedition against this Chief, but that it had accomplished little, owing to the inter ference of one of the Wahabi Amir's lieutenants. 70. In another letterf written on the same day Colonel Disbrowe submit- f No. 279, dated the 3rd December 1864. ted an application from His Highness Syud Thovveyni, for a supply of ammu nition, etc., and while pointing out that both the Maskat and Wahabi States were on terms of amity with the British Government, he observed 'Even when His Highness the Sultan of Maskat has been on unfriendly relations with Wahabi authorties, His Highness has always, during my service in the Persian Gulf, received the sympathies of the British Government through its representatives in the Gulf. Wahabi encroachments are essentially noxious and require discouragement 71. Subsequently, the Sultan of M.askat addressed the Bombay Govern ment confhming the intelligence which had already been communicated by Colonel Disbrowe, adding that he had written to the Wahabi Amir, and suggested^ that the differences which had arisen, in consequence of the proceed ings of his Lieutenant Suderi, should be decided by the British Resident in the Persian Gulf. 72. Colonel Pelly being then on the Arab Coast was requested to report fully on the differences between the Sultan of Maskat and the Wahabi Chief and to employ his good offices if mediation were of any use, but ' to let the19 Sultan clearly understand, that the British Government had no intention of interfering in the d.ifferenct'S betwpen the powers on the shores of the Persian Gulf, by aiding one party to coerce the other.' 73. Colonel Pellv's enquiries* did not satisfy him that the Wahahi •Report to Govermneut. da'ted Zlst January deputy Was acting Under instructions frOUl 1866. '' ' his capital. He wrote:— *' Tt is more probable that the deputy saw a chance of interfering with Mask at, that he availed himself of this, and that when the matter came before the Amir, he watched events. ' Hud the Sultan of Maskat consulted me before hp acted, I would have advised him firstly, to avoid, if possible, a strucrgle with the Wahahi power, and secondly, to post- ponp, usiny my name as an arbitrator until after I should communicate with the Wahabi Amir. His using my namp is intended as a compliment, but in practice cannot but induce in the mind of the Wahabi Amir a presumption that ray arbitrament may lean towards M askat/' 74. These views were concurred in by Government, and Colonel Pelly was reqnestedf to avail himself of an opportunity of personally communicating f GoTemment letter No. 747, a.ted the 2!i„d with His Highness the Sultan on the March 1865. subject. The Sultan was at the same time informed by Government of the instructions which had been comrauni- cated to Colonel Pelly, with a view to placing his relations with the Wahabis oa a more friendly basis. XXIL—Visit of Colonel Pelly to Riadh. 1865. 75. On the 14th Eebruary 1865, Colonel Pelly announced to Government his intention of visiting the Amir of the Wahabis at his capital. Various reasons induced him to take this extraordinary step. He wrote « i found that the name of the Wahabi Amir was always mentioned with a kind of respectful dread. The attitude of the Amir towards ourselves was considered hostile ; or to use the words of Colonel Disbrowe, in his letter to your address, No. 277 of the 3rd December last, the sympathies of the British Government, through its representative in the Gulf were with Maskat, whilp Wahabi encroachments were considered essentially noxious. A recent cause of ill-blood had been by our seizure of certain of the Wahabi craft. And when, after arrival in the Persian Gulf, I forwarded a friendly letter to the Amir, m view to an amicable interview, his reply was curtly repulsive, and couched in language which showed at once indignation and a sense ol injustice at our line of policy. lt This was not, a state of relations wliich could tend to the general peace and development of commerce in the regions of the Persian Gulf. And I therefore availed myself of a snb- spquent opportunity for again writing to the Amir in a polite spirit giving him credit for the iustice and sternness of his rule, and assuring him that he would always find me cordially willing to co-operate in maintaining the general peace and good order which he too seemed to have at heart. . «Sometime after the above occurrence, I learned from the proceedino's of the Royal Geographical Society, issued on the S^th of April 1864, that little seemed to be known of the interior of Arabia ; that it was a desideratum to determine with scientific accuracy the geographical position of the Wahabi capital, and of some other points of interest; and that the 0 Society were desirous of solving certain questions as to the identification of names of places, and as to the direction of the watershed. &lt;£ I confess, also, that when I found the Society recording that it was very difficult for 'Europeans' to enter Arabia on account of the 1 extraordinary ' jealousy of the population, ' and that to be known as a European traveller at any rate in the W ahabi country, that is to say in the central plateau of Arabia, would be exceedingly dangerous, possibly even fatal, I was unwilling that tins should be supposed to be the case in regard to any Asiatic territory which might be ad j a cant to my jurisdiction, for it had been my habit to consider that an linglish Officer can go anywhere when his duty to the Government requires it. 'On the whole, it seemed advisable to land at Koweit, and thence visit the Amir at, his capital, returning to the Persian Gulf by another route. Accordingly I am now on the march, and hope that I shall leave the Wahabi provinces on polite terms with the people, and with the prospect of more friendly relations with the Wahabi Government. It is possible, also, i may find an opportunity for a casual and friendly office towards smoothing the present differences between the Sultan of Maskat and the Wahabis.' 76 Colonel Pelly appears to have successfully accomplished bis journey to the Wahabi capital of Eiadh. He returned to Busbire on the 25th March,20 and informed Government by telegraph that his visit had been *' satisfactorily concluded, and our relations are now quite friendly.' XXIII —Differences between the Sultan of JVTaskat and Amir of Nejd. 1864-1865. 77. Colonel Pelly visited Maskat on his way to Bombay in April 1865. He elicited by his enquiries that the differences between the Maskat and Wahabi States had a tow-fold aspect :—first, the rebellion of the heredtary Chief of Rostack, who had thrown off his allegiance to Maskat, and declared fealty to the Wahabi Amir; secondly, and principally a demand on the part of the Wahabi Amir for an increased rate of annual tribute from the Sultan, com bined with a threat of invasion in case of non-compliance. 78. The Sultan of Maskat expressed his willingness to abide by any arrangement which Colonel Pelly mi&lt;?ht suggest. There was reason to fear that the quarrel had gone too far to render mediation of any effect, but it was clearly the only remedy which could be attempted. Colonel Pelly accord ingly wrote to the Chief of Kostack, inviting him to Maskat under a guarantee of safe-conduct, with a view to an amicable discussion of differences. He also wrote to the Wahabi Amir, statin? his readiness to afford good offices, and enclosed a letter from the Sultan of Maskat, in which the latter declared himself prepared to abide by whatever settlement the Resident might make. t9. The Chief of Rostack replied that the offer of mediation had come too late, he being already irretrievably commited to the Wahabis. No reply could^ be expected from the Wahabi Amir for some time, and it was altogether questionable whether he would assent to any amicable arrangement u When I was at his capital ' wrote Colonel Pelly ' he spoke with contemptuous fierceness of the Sultan of Maskat. declaring that he was a drowning man, and that he the Amir would bring him to obedience by force.' . 80 - If good offices failed it appeared to Colonel Pelly that a practical ques- tion would have to be met, viz., 'supposing Maskat and the Wahabi Power to go to war, what attitude would Government^wish to assume thereto?' To this he answ ered that in the abstract the true policy of Government in relation to all disputes among tribes in these regions appeared to be to let those tribes light it out on shore, and for Government to limit itself to keeping the peace at sea ; but there were certain circumstances in regard to Maskat which Colonel irelly thought it necessary to present for consideration Firstly, ihe second Article of the Maskat Treaty provides that, 'tlie friend of that Sirkar is the friend of this, and the friend of this Sirkar is to be the friend of that Sirkar, and in the same way the enemy of this is to be the enemy of that. w; 11 S !

In the views thus expressed by Colonel Pelly as to the course which Goverumeat letter No. 1360, dated the 3rd June Our Treaty obligation S cind SOUnd. policy 1S65 - indicated, the Bombay Government gene rally concurred, but it seemed premature to decide on any definite course of action until the British had heard what the Wahabi Amir had to say. Mean while the officer in charge of the Residency in the Persian Gulf (Colonel Pelly having proceeded to Enrope) and the Political Agent at Masqat, were informed that it was exceedingly desirable that these differences should be adjusted by their good offices without hostilities commencing between Maskat and the Wahabi Amir. 82. These proceedings having been reported to the Government of India, Mr. Secretary Muir replied on the 21st June 1865, that the Viceroy in Council 11 concurred in the views and approved the action of the Bombay Government.' XXIV.—Rebellion of two Oman tribes nnder leadership of a Wahabi officer. (2) Outrages on British subjects at Sur, 1865- 83. Shortly afterwards the Political Agent at Maskat brought to notice „ , J , that a Wahabi Agent had arrived at that Assistant Resident, Busbire, No, 34, dated 23rd , .. u , j n , i i. £ July 1865. place with demands for the payment of Political Agent, Maskat, No. isa, dated the 4th three or four times the customary annual August is6o. contribution, and that on his recommen dation, His Highness Syud Thoweyni had sent a messenger with a letter to the Wahabi Amir, informing him that he had paid the usual annual contribu tion, but as regards additional demands he awaited the Amir's reply to Colonel Pelly's communication offering to mediate, and to the letter enclosed from him self (the Sultan). 84. This was followed by a letter from the Political Agent, dated the 22nd August, reporting that the Beni-bu-ali and Jenubah tribes had, under the leadership of Abdul Aziz Wahabi. invested the castle of Sur, and on the refusal of the garrison to surrender laid siege to it. Resistance was successfully offered by the Maskat troops for two days, but on the night of the third day the besiegers succeeded in undermining the walls of the bazar adjoining the castle, and effected an entry, when the entire wealth of the place, the greater part of which belonged to British Indian subjects, fell into their hands. During the assault one British subject was killed, whose remains were denied the rites of burial, and another w T as wounded. The castle subsequently surrendered. After suffering much hardship and indignity, and being stript of nearly all their clothing, the British Indian subjects were permitted to leave Sur and proceed to Maskat. They represented their losses to the Political Agent at 27,000 dollars. 85. On receiving intelligence of these occurrences the Political Agent addressed the Sultan of Maskat, exhorting him to take ' active and determined measures, tempered with clemency in its place and season,' to bring the rebels to submission. He at the same time addressed the Wahabi Amir, and also bis deputy Sudeyri at Brymi, protesting in the name of the British Govern ment at the proceedings ofTheir subordinate Abdul Aziz at Sur. 86. In forwarding to the Government of India a copy of the correspondence relating to these events. His Excellency the Governor in accordance with the * Letter from Mr. Secretary Muir, No. 809, dated request of the Governor-General in Council the 20th September 186,s. (previously* comnrjjnicated) proceeded to record his views on the attitude proper to be observed by the British Govern ment in the position of affairs in Oman. 87. After reviewing briefly the events connected with the rise of the Wahabi power, and its temporary subversion by Ibrahim Pasha, His Excel lency wrote:— ' There can be no doubt that the Wahabis have of late shown a considerable revival Minute by His Excellency the Governor, concurred of their former activity, both as an aggressive E by the Honorable Board, dated the 9th October temporal power in the interior of Arabia, and as 1865 * leaders of fanatical revival in India.''There seems mucli ground for believing that the great increase, which has taken place ' during the last ten years, in the slave trade between East Africa and Arabia, is due to a new direction having been given to the naval enterprise of the tribes on the sea coast which were formerly most imbued with Wahabi fanaticism and most active in piracy. ' The visits of Mr Palgrave and Colonel Pelly to the Wahabi capital have thrown great light upon the resources of this power, and the information recorded by these travellers shows very clearly that the Wahabis have of late years been recovering from the effects of the chastisetnect formerly inflicted on them, and that they are likely to become exceedingly troublesome to all in contact with them, who will not submit to their religious domination. (C A part from any internal impulse given by a revived spirit of religious fanaticism there are several obvious causes of the late development of Wahabi aggressive power iu Arabia. ' Much is of course due to the natural effects of so many years of comparative rest in repairing their exhausted resources; something also no doubt to the disappearance of the generation which had experienced the power of the Egyptian Pasha, the late Imam of Maskat, and of British Naval and Military expeditionary forces, ' More however is probably owing to the sensible decay of vigour in the ruler of Maskafc and to the comparative rarity of any visit from our vessels of war to the old pirate coast of the Persian Gulf. ' But whatever the cause, there can be no doubt of the evil effects of this revival of Wahabi power, and it is clear that these effects cannot be confined to the Continent of Arabia. We have had more than one warning symptom during the past year or two of a possible revival of piracy on our own Indian Coasts. There is every year increased activity in the slave trade carried on between East Africa and Arabia, chiefly by vessels belonging to the Wahabi pirate ports, and the aggressions of the Wahabis by land on the territories of the Imam of Maskat, threaten seriously to injure a power which for several generations past has been the only representative of civilization and order in Eastern Arabia. te I do not think that this is a state of things in which the British Government in India should be entirely passive. Our interest in the matter is not precisely the same as in 1821, when the pirates from the Wahabi coast threatened serious injury to the general trade of Bombay; but we have Treaty ties with the Imam of Maskat, and there can be no doubt that any considerable increase of Wahabi influence would lead to, at least, an attempt to revive piracy, and seriously impede the rapidly increasing commerce of the Persian Gulf. It might also at any time interfere with our Telegraphic communication with Europe. u The important question remains what it behoves the British Government to do under these circumstances ? 11 It seems quite clear that there is little chance of the Amir paying the slightest atten tion either to such friendly advice as Colonel Pelly gave him, or to the temperate remonstrances of Colonel Disbrowe. ' I would not for the present advise any renewal of an attempt on the part of our Political Agents to open a diplomatic correspondence with the Amir of the Wahabis. He is from his ignorance of our power not likely to pay the slightest attention to our wishes or remonstrances, and for the present any attempt to open further communication with him is only likely to embroil us further. ' I would instruct Colonel Disbrowe to adopt a somewhat different tone to His Highness the Imam of Maskat; to point out to His Highness clearly, but in temperate and friendly language, that the aggressions of the Wahabis are not likely to be checked by tame acquies cence, or by a constantly increasing addition of the tribute His Highness pays to them that the Government of India will learn with regret, and surprise that its subjects have' been murdered and plundered in a large town under His Highness' flag without any effectual at tempt on His Highness' part to punish his own rebellious subjects, or to expel hostile invaders. ' I would point out to His Highness that the occasion is one which imperatively calls upon him to imitate the example of his illustrious father, to set his finances in order to conciliate and revive the spirit of his feudatory tribes, to reorganize his military and naval forces, and to repel by force, if negotiation fail, the insolent aggressions of his Wahabi neighbours. ' I would not by any means lead him to lean on our aid in accomplishing these obiects but I would assure him of our intention scrupulously to fulfil our Treaty obligations and of our desire to give him every reasonable support, not only moral but material, in anv weil-di. ect ed efforts he may make to re-establish his authority. ■fl- n'T; 0im b - ™ d ? ubt His 1%W power, if properly exerted, is ample to effect all that is required. I would aid him with munitions, and, if absolutely necLarv with assistance in money, and with the presence of such ships of Her Majesty's naval forces mthese Seas as the Commander-in-Chief may think best calculated to be of use in aidine the Imam to re-establish His Highness' authority in Sur or any other place on the seaboard ,If which his rebellious subjects or the Wahabi enemy may have deprived him./6) 23 ' Colonel Pelly may be expected to return from his leave by the in-coming Mail, and I would propose to send him to Maskat in the first instance, before he proceeds to Bushire, with such instructions as the Governor General may approve.. ' With this view these proceedings should be at once reported to the Governor General, and early instructions should be solicited.' 88. In reply to the letter from tlie Bombay Government, submitting the Letter fo.m the offiei »tin s Under Secretly, foregoing Minute, the Government of Foreign Department, No. 940, dated the 8th Nov India Communicated On the 8tll NoVCm- ember 1865. ^305 following telegraphic instruc tions from Sir Charles 'Wood :— &lt;{ A telegram has been sent to the Senior Naval Officer at Bombay to comply with any request of yours. It may be advisable to beg the Senior Officer at Bombay to proceed to the Coast of Arabia, and in concert with the British Resident to take such measures instrumental they may think likely to promote an arrangement between the Wahabi Chief and the Imaum. He is not, however, to undertake anything on land.' In communicating these instructions, the Government of India desired that Colonel Pelly should impress on the Sultan of Maskat the necessity of vigorous action on his own part, and discourage any hope that the British Government would fight his battles for him. XXV--British Operations against the Wahabis, 1865—1866. 89. Colonel Pelly having meanwhile returned from Europe, he was furnish ed with the instructions received from the Government of India on the 14th November 1865 (the date of their receipt) and proceeded in the Steamer Bere nice to the Persian Gulf, for the purpose of enquiring into the actual position of affairs in Oman so as better to enable him to act on the arrival of a man-of- war at Maskat. On the 28th November he met the Sultan atBarka, and found that he was fully alive to the necessity of vindicating his authority atSur, and taking measures for the defence of this inland frontier, but that he was ill-prepared to do so from the weakness of his material resources. His great immediate want was money. Colonel Pelly strongly recommended that a loan of two lacs, at 5 per cent., should be granted to the Sultan, for which His Highness had offered the customs of the port of Gwadur as security. He also recommended that two 18-pounder guns with ammunition should be supplied to aid the Sultan in his defensive operations. The Government of India, to whom these recommend- Mr. Secretary Muir's letter No. 44, dated the 17th ationS Were Submitted, approved the January 1866. grant of the guns and ammunition, but observed that no sufficient reason had been adduced for the loan of the two lacs. 90. Meanwhile Amir Eeysal had died (1865) and was succeeded by his son Abdullah. This news however reached our Political Officers in the Gulf in January 1866. 91. Before Colonel Pelly's arrival at Maskat the officer in charge of the Besidency in the Persian Gulf, forwarded a communication purporting from the Wahabi Amir Eeysal in reply to the representions which had been made to him regarding the mal-treatment of British subjects at Sur. The Amir while stating that he had ordered the release of the British subjects who had been taken prisoners by his lieutenant in the attack on Sur, and the restoration of their plundered property, was silent about making any reparation for the injury already done, and in regard to compensation for the man who had been killed on the occasion. 92. The Amir defended the proceedings of his lieutenant on the ground that there existed between the Wahabi Power and the British Government an Agreement originally effected in the time of the late Saud, and again ratified in the time of the present Ruler. 93. On this point the Assistant Resident at Bushire was requested by telegraph, to state whether there was any ground for the assertion of the Wahabi Chief—that any such specific or formal engagement existed between him and the British Government.n 94. Colonel Peliy was at the same time requested to enquire and report on Bombay Government letter Kb. 8119, dated the tlie extent of miSCllief Committed at Sllf, 2i8t December is65. ailc [ Aether anything might reasonably be demanded on this account from the Wahabi Chief. 96. These proceedings were duly reported to the Government of India, Bombay Government letter No. 197, dated the and the Foreign Department at Calcutta 2ist December 1865. was subsequently informed by telegraph, that no trace of any such Treaty as that mentioned by the Wahabi Chief Letter form Mr. Secretary Muir, No. 66, dated the COUld be found OU the records of the Bom- 24th January 1866. Government or of the Bushire Resi dency. In reply, the Government of India after alluding to this fact, which a search in their own records had helped to confirm, observed ' It will be advisable for the Bombay Government to inform the Waliabi Amir that the British Government is not aware of the existence of any formal agreement between itself and the Amir; but that if any such document does exist, a copy of it, no doubt, must be in the Amir's possession, and the Amir will do well to produce it for verification. The Amir should be further given to understand that the Imaum of Maslcat is our friend and ally, and the British Government while hoping for a happy settlement of any differences which there may now be between the Imaum and the Amir, cannot regard any encroachment on the Imaum's territory without grave concern. . &lt;c His Excellency in Council considers that it would be inexpedient to press the Wahabi Amir for compensation for any loss which British subjects may have incurred durin 0, the late hostilities.' 96. Before these instructions reached Colonel Pelly's hands, events in the Persian Gulf rapidly assumed a momentous aspect arising from the determina tion of the Maskat Government to proceed to open hostilities with the Waha- bis. 97. On the 21st December, Colonel Pelly re-visited the Sultan of Maskat and communicated to His Highness the offer of Government to aid him in guns and ammunition. He had entered on preparations for blockading the Wahabi ports of Khatif and Ojair, having received solemn assurances from the Bahrein authorities that they would co-operate with him. It was arranged that Syud Turki, who had recently given unequivocal proofs of fidelity and attachment to his brother the Sultan's cause, should proceed with the Maskat fleet to Bahrein in view to carry out the contemplated blockade. a C ^ lonel bein ^ desirou s of examining the state of affairs on the Arab Coast proceeded to Bahrein with the Sultan's ships, and en route communi cated ith the Chiefs of the Pirate Coast, reminding them of the aggressive pohcy of the Wahabus and stating that the English Government would not object to their aiding the Sultan by land. During this time the Sultan was i/ engaged in collecting his tribes, and equipping them for an advance towards Beiaymi, a strategic point of great importance—threatenins the Maskat territories and the Pirate Coast. D 99. The Wahabis were not indifferent to these warlike preparations. They Lieutenant-Colonel Felly's letter to Government, had a short time before moved n flvtnnh f •7 T r ry T; - ment 'P- the port of SahZ only a fet hours distance from Sohar itself, and driven the Bunnya residents into the lea 't? t ■ A 0m pclls i hed '7.downing. ' It is remarkable ' wrote Colonel PeUv that at the very time this raid had taken place the Sultan was under the im pression that the Wahabi leader was concealing himself.

On the 1866 - 3rd January, the Highflyer called at Elphinstone inlet and found that Colonel Pelly had left for Sohar to which place Captain Pasley accordingly returned. At his first interview with Colonel Pelly he requested him to state in writing what were his views in regard to the Maskat and Wahabi disturbances. Colonel Pelly replied ' I understand that Her Majesty's Government will not do anything by land to aid the Sultan of Maskat, but that they are prepared to aid him on the seaboard by the presence of a man-of-war. a The only points where the Wahabis can be touched from seaward are their ports of Ojair and Khatif with the intermediate Island Fortification of Demaum, commanding the entrance to Khatif, and so far as my unprofessional eye can see the only method by which a ship of war can aid the Sultan in his present crisis is by blockading the Wahabi ports until the Wahabi government comes to terms. ' Complicated with the Wahabi invasion is the butchery of one British Indian subject, and the plunder of ten or more others at the port of Sur, on the Maskat coast, by the Wahabi troops. If you blockade, the arrangements of this matter might be included in the general settlement; if you do not blockade^ it would be for you to give to this matter such • The orders furnished to Captain Pasley by the consideration as you may deem fit, and may be Commodore enjoined him to assist the Resident at enabled to, under the orders* you have received Maskat, shonld he require in writing, even so far from the Cnmmodore. as to use coercive means, in aid of our ally the Imam, but he was clearly to understand that be was not to undertake any thing on land. ' In either case I shall be happy to hand to you a letter calling on the Wahabi gov ernment to apologize and make adequate reparation for that insult. u The lette r would require seven days for its transmission to the Wahabi capital from the date of its delivery to the Wababi authorities at Khatif, three days more might be granted for the consideration of the letter by the Wahabi government, and seven days more for the return courier, in all seventeen days before commencing operations. ' If you determine to blockade, it would be necessarv for me to give the usual warning. It will probably be obvious to you that it would not be advisable for the English Government to begin any operations which it might not be convenient to carry to a conclusion, to act otherwise would be to confirm the impression already so prevalent of our own absence o£ Naval power, and would be to leave our ally the Sultan more than ever liable to Wahabi aggression/' 101. Captain Pasley rejoined :— ' I perfectly agree with you that it would be injudicious to commence any hostile opera tions wich it might not be convenient for the Government to carry out, and as the Highflyer's time is limited in the Persian Gulf, and as I have no reason to suppose any other vessel o£ war is coming to take my place, I cannot recommend the establishment of a blockade which would not be enforced after the departure of the High flyer. With regard to the injuries inflicted on British subjects by the Wahabis at Sur, I shall be very happy to convey your letter, demanding an apology and reparation for that insult to the Sheikh of Khatif, for conveyance to the Wahabi Chief, and as the answer will be seventeen days returning to Khatif, I propose to visit the different ports on the Pirate Coast, returning to Khatif on the 27th or 28th instant, when I hope to hear from you. ' Should the answer from the Wahabi Chief be unfavorable, I shall be happy to assist you in confiscating the shipping in the port of Khatif, or by destroying his ports or otherwise as you may direct.' 102. In accordance with Captain Pasley's views. Colonel Pelly handed him on the 6th January, a letter to the address of the 'Wahabi Chief, with one to the Governor of Khatif, and placed at his disposal the services of ' the Native Agent for the Arabian Coast,' whom Colonel Pelly described ' as the best man for this work in Gulf.' 103. The following is a translation of the letter addressed to the Wahahi Chief:— ' Your Highness has invaded the territories of Maskat, an independent State, in allianee with the British Government. About nine months ago the British Government permitted me to use my good offices as mediator between you and the Sultan of Maskat. I addressed a polite letter to you on this subject, your Highness did not acknowledge that letter, on the contrary your troops have since butchered one British Indian subject, and plundered ten others of all they possessed,26 a These subjects were imprisonerlj deprived of food and water^ and were ordered to pay a ransom in 100 dollars each. These British Indian subjects were not even allowed to dispose of their murdered companion's corpse. These British Indian subjects thus killed or plundered were peacefully residing in the port of Sur, in the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Maskat. ' I have now to request that your Highness first send to me on board H. M's. S. High- Jlyer lying between Demaum and Bahrein, a full and written apology for the wanton outrages on the part of your dependents. ' 2ndly. That the messenger who brings that apology shall bring with him also the sum or 37,700 dollars being the amount ascertained to have been plundered from the said British Indian subjects.'' . ' 8 rdly. That your Highness give at the same time solemn written assurances that no similar outrages and butchery shall in future take place.' This letter will be handed to your Highness's Governor of Khatif, who will be request ed to pass a receipt for the same, and seventeen days will be allowed for the letter to reach your Highness, and for your Highness to return a reply. tt- i ' If at , tlie e . x P irati( ?n of seventeen days the required satisfaction is not given by your Highness, the British ships of war will destroy the forts on your seaboard, and confiscate your xiighness s craft there Ijmg. 'Only this moment it has come to my knowledge that your Highness's troops have attacked the fort of Shaim in the Muskat territories, and driven the British Indian subiects there residing into the sea. One o£ these has perished in the snrf, the others have come on board to complain. 104. The Highflyer left Sohar on the same day and anchored in the outer harbour of Bahrein on the 13th January, to enable the Native Agent to visit Khatif and deliver the letter for the Amir of the Wahabis. This duty accomplished, the Sighfiyer sailed on the 13th to Abu-Thabe, and then cruised along the Pirate Coast, calling at the principal ports in her course. On arrival at Ajman, Captain Pasley in compliance witU a suggestion communi cated to him by the Resident before he left Sohar, proceeded to destroy a AYahabi tower which dominated that part of the coast. This operation was judiciously carried out by Captain Pasley without any loss of life to the garri- son. On the 23rd January, the Highfiyer anchored at Elphinstone inlet, which Uoionel Pelly had named as a rendezvous. A conference was held on the 25th by the Resident and Captain Pasley, when it was explained by Colonel Pellv that he was unable to accompany the Highflyer in the Residency steamer to Khatif, as the state of affairs at Bereymi, Bunder Abbas and Sur, required his presence near the Sultan. He added a request that Captain Pasley would if practicable, destroy two Wababi war-buggalows which were said to be in the creeks near Khatif. 105. The Bighftyer left Elphinstone inlet on the 28th January, and wordf-— S subse ' lueilt P rooeed ings will be best deseribed in his own « I arrived off Khatif on the 30th, and on the Native Agent's return from the town told me there was no answer from the Chief of the Wahabis ; that the Sheihh (or Governor n''i T* u J r» n0 '''fy for me &gt; an&lt;3 requested me to wait twelve days and hp would be sent to Head-Quarters for an answer. * ''On the 2nd, I sent the boats armed to Khatif, in charge of Lionf-Prmnf TViu with orders to bring out all the Wahabi Dhows that might be in the harbour, and to desW the two war-bnggalows and a small fort called Burj Bullif which commands the boat channd to Khatit, which service he accomplished satisfactorily, but there bein«- only one W «Tk' Dhow in the harbour, and she not being worth removing, she was destroyed. y 0De ' ahab, ' 0n the 3r d February, I sent the boats in charge of Lieutenanf T.™a. j destroy, if possible, the fort of Demaum which is said to command the boat channe to'^^ it being a little past high water, he was unable to get the boom boat^ nJ, ^ Khatit, use ; he, therefore, took the cutters, with as many men as thev could hnlrl / f? r 0f and Fivmce, and materials for blowing up the tower he howLr on^rl ^ ^ yards of the beach, when he waded on shore and succeeded in effecting an t f ^ 200 but finding the garrison much stronger than he anticipated ffhp NnH * rai5C ® ? 0 tower i me twelve men) and being unable to ffainThe bi! ^} ve M^t having told regret to say, the loss of three men killed, and two officers and three 0 mf t0 ^ et , reat T 1 a copy of Lieutenant Long 's report, J wounded.

The Highflyer rejoined the Kesident at Maskat on the 9th Feb ruary, and on receiving Captain Pasley's report of the operations before Demaum, it appeared to Colonel Pelly more than ever necessary that a prompt and severe example should be made of those Arabs (of the Jenebah tribe) who were implicated with the Wahabis in the plunder and murder of our subjects at Sur. There were other reasons too which called for the punishment of the Jenebah. They had long been notorious among our Naval Officers as the most cruel and unscrupulous slavers and pirates. They were among the Arab slave- dealers who had conspired in 1861 to assassinate the British Agent at Zanzibar for his anti-slavery proceedings. It was also believed that they were concerned in the murder of three seamen of H. M's. S. Wasp who had disappeared in one of their craft a few months before. The Sultan of Maskat was assured of their criminality and had himself proceeded to Sur five or six months previously with the intention of punishing them, but he was suddenly obliged to return to Maskat owing to the detection of a conspiracy to dethrone him. Colonel Pelly had also in the preceding month sent the Berenice to Sur with a letter addressed to the heads of the Jenebah tribe, demanding from them the payment of 27,000 dollars as compensation for the property plundered by them from British subjects, and warning them that measures would be taken to enforce the demand if not speedily complied with. Their reply, however, was ' that on a former occasion when Lieutenant Pengelly threatened a tribe on the Coast nothing was done, and that they were quite sure the Resident would not come now.' Letter to Government, No. 9, dated the 12th Matters were in this position wrote February 1866. Colonel Pelly. u When Highflyer arrived at Maskat on the 9th instant with a report of her repulse at •You have paid no attention to my previous letter Demaum, and then it seemed to me more than to you, nor have you satisfied the just demands cvGr nGCGSsary to give a prompt and severe Gxamplo therein made.

Accordingly I started at once all non-combatants from any buildings, whether with 'Berenice' taking the Maskat Wazir with town, Village or what not m the neighbourhood of , • i / o , ' , yonr fort and shipping, as it is my intention to me, and. on anival at bur sent tne appended attack you at noon, six hours from this time. letter 515 to the tribe. ' joined me on the morning of the 11th, and her fire was to open at noon; at 11 a.m . the Chiefs came aboard to me to ask for delay till the spring when their craft from Jeddah would return. At noon Captain Pasley fired a gun every half hour, thus giving a further caution to all non-combatants round the forts and shipping to clear out, and it waa arranged with a neighbouring Chief that he might shelter these. &lt;( At 1 P.Mi Captain Pasley opened fire on the forts, utterly ruining them. 'At day break in the morning of the 13th Highflyer's boats went up the Sur creek in charge of Lieutenant Long and destroyed or confiscated every Suri craft ; burning also a' large quantity of ship-timber. Some of the tribe showed in the distance, but they were com pletely awed by the fire. ' I beg to append Captain Pasley Vreport of proceedings, in original, and beg to draw the attention of Grovernment to the complete and skilful manner in which Captain Pasley and the officers and men under his command have inflicted this severe punishment on the Suri Jenebah tribe in their own creek and nest. This tribe number some six thousand fighting men, reputed the bravest and most cruel of littoral Arabs. 'Owing to a shift of wind during the operations, a small part of the temporary huts of the town caught fire, but this accident was wholly unavoidable; and no great damage is done to the Town. ' All non-combatants had cleared out before the attack.' 107. The Bighflyer returned to Bombay on the 18th [February, bringing +Minute by His Excellency the Governor, eon- with her liieiltenant-Colonel Pelly S deS» curred in by the Honourable Board, dated the 24th patches On which His Excellency the GOV- February 1866. ernor recorded the following Minutef ' I think the acknowledgments of Government are due to Captain Pasley and the officers and mm of the Highflyer, for the energy aud ability with which all these operations were carried out/ J'These operations appear, with one partial exception, to have been most successful, and have, moreover, been executed with a care for the lives and property of non-combatants, which reflect great credit on Captain Pasley and all employed. 'While lamenting the loss of the brave men who were killed at Demaum, I would express our sincere admiration of the gallantry displayed by Lieutenant Long and the whole party engaged, and particularly of those who are lumed by their Commanding Officer, as worthy of special mention. ' Lieutenant Colonel Pelly is of opinion that it will be necessary to return to Demaum with the means of battering it from a raft. 'But before making any fresh attempt of the kind it will be well to ascertain from the Kesident what has been the effect of the operations already carried out ? It appears that after the expiration of the term fixed by Colonel Pelly in his demand on the Wahabis for satisfac tion, several Wahabi war-buggalows and the tower of Burj Bullif, commanding one entrance to the harbour of Khatiff, were destroyed, and the fort of Demaum itself was plied with shot, shell and rockets to an extent which must have made a considerable impression on the garrison, and probably removed any notion they may have entertained as to their power to resist any attack which might be made on it with an adequate force. It will be well to ascertain the total effect of all these operations before undertaking any thing further against the fort of Demaum which seems in itself to be of little importance. ' I would propose, therefore, to ask the Commodore to visit Maskat before the season for active operations in the Gulf draws to a close, taking with him any part of his squadron which can be spared from other service, and that he should confer with Lieutenant-Colonel Pelly, who will, by that time, have ascertained the general effect on the WahaLis and the littoral Arabs, of the whole series of operations, including those which may have been undertaken by His Highness the Imam by land. Should it appear that sufficient has been done for this season, no further operations against Khatif will be necessary, if otherwise, the Commodore will be in a position to decide what may be possible and necessary to secure, at least for the current season, the peace of the Maritime tribes of the Gulf, and the safety of the British subjects residing amongst them. . ' Since Colonel Pelly wrote, he will have received the instructions of the Governor General m Council as contained in Mr. Secretary Muir's letter of the S^th January last No. 66, which express the opinion of the ^ iceroy that it would be inexpedient to press the Wahabi Amir for compensation for any loss which British subjects may have incurred during the late hostilities between the Wahabis and the subjects of Maskat. Moreover the damage inflicted on the \^ahabis and Surees by the Highflyer in destroying their towers and war-buggalows will apparently at least equal the value of what our subjects were supposed to . &lt;f 1 ^ ould submit these remarks with Colonel Pell'y despatches to the Governor General in Council, and inform His Excellency that we propose requesting the Commodore to sail as soon as he considers expedient, and that we hold at his disposal, if he thinks they can be useful the gun-boats or materials for a raft or any other munitions which the Dockyard may afford' and which he may think necessary for the use of our squadron, or useful to our allies in further operations on the Arabian Coast. The Commodore's instructions from the Admiraltv preclude his undertaking any hostile operations except under a written intimation of the Governor General s wishes. t it.' ^ ^ •' :i0 ' w ' ever ' anticipate that it will be found possible or necessary to undertake further operations on the Pirate Coast this season. ertaKe . &lt;f It may be well to note as our reason for not asking the Commodore to await at Bom- b ?V, c r f? ly Governor-General in Council, that the summer is I believe the time of Pearl-fishing, when the evil-disposed among the littoral Arabs are most apt to be trouble- some, but our men-of-war cannot, without the most urgent necessity, undertake active operations in the Gulf at that season, and, therefore, if it should appear to be absolutely necessary to do anything for the protection of British subjects or property, before the warm weather sets in, there is no time to be lost. r r c ' At Mussendom the Commodore will be able to learn the wishes nf n General in Council by telegram.' 0f the GOTC ™ Qr 108.

In deputing his N^tiv# Agent29 he sent the only man at his disposal, who could be of any use, and he must have put himself to much inconvenience in dispensing with the Native Agent's attendance ou hiuaself at that particular moment/' 109. These proceedings appeared to the Bombay Goyernment to illustrate very forcibly a necessity which was not felt while the Indian Navy existed, and occasion was taken to submit to the Governor General in Council an ex pression of their views as to the best means of supplying this want by provid ing a class of officers possessino; local experience to aid Her Majesty's Naval Forces when employed in the Persian Gulf, and other similar regions. 110. While these proceedings were under consideration a telegram, dated Mussendom, the 21st February, was received from Colonel Pelly, announcing Lieutenant-Colonel Felly's report to Government, the death of His IfighnCSS Syud TllO- No. 17, dated the i4th March 1866, with accom- weyni. After the Highflyer s departure pamments. from the Gulf, Colonel Pelly remained at Mussendom in hourly expectation of intelligence that the Sultan had taken Bereymi when a boat arrived from Maskat with letters from the local Agent, and from Syud Saulem, the eldest son of the Sultan, informing him that Syud Thoweyni was dead, that Syud Saulem had succeeded, and that the latter desired to conduct his government under the Resident's counsel, and requested his presence at Maskat. XXVL—The Amir of Nejd comes to terms, 1866. 111. The murder of Syud Thoweyni in February 1866, frustrated the operations projected by him for the capture ef Beraymi. On the other hand on Amir Feysal's death about October 1865, his successor Abdullah was anxious to make peace with the British. The spring of action of this move was probably his fear of his brother Saud's intrigues against his power. So we find him sending making offers of peace to the British Besident early in 1866. On 20th February the Besident telegraphed from Mussendom as follows:— r ' I have just received the following letter dated 28th ultimo from the Wahabis Amir begins Your wish to mediate between us and the Ruler of Maskat, this mediation is approved by us, but if the arrangemeat come to us is not acted upon, the penalty should be exacted from the party not abiding by it. Beply what your decision may be, an agent will follow to make arrangements ends, &lt;c Another letter from the Wahabi Amir in reply to my demands states that he desires a consultation and will send an agent; that the Genebah tribe are guilty in regard to our subjects at Sohar but that it is incumbent on him, the Amir, to try and recover the money'. 112. Soon after the Amir dispatched an envoy to Bushire with definite proposals of peace. Measures were taken for the protection of British in terests at Maskat during the confusion that ensued there after the late Sul tan's murder. 113. Colonel Pelly arrived at Bushire on the 21st April, and had an Political a, June 1866, Nos, 62 a.d 63. interview with the Wahabi Envoy, whose assurances and wishes appeared to be in all respects satisfactory. He gave Colonel Pelly the following written declaration :— ie I Mahomed bin Abdullah bin Maneh am certain on the following points I am authorized by Imam Abdullah bin Fysal to request the Sahib, the Resident in the Persian Gulf, to become the medium of friendship between Imam Abdullah bin Fysal and the British Goverument. ' Secondly. —I assure the Resident in the Persian Gulf on the part of Imam Abdullah bin Fysal that he will not oppose or injure British subjects residing in territories under the authority of Abdullah bin Fysal and, ' Thirdly.—\ assure the Resident in the Persian Gulf, on the part of Imam Abdullah m F ysal, that he will not injure or attack the territories of the Arab tribes in alliance with the British Government, especially of the Kingdom of Maskat further than in receiving the Zukat that has been customary of old.30 ' Written by my hand at Bushire on Saturday the 5th day of Zilhajjeh 1882—2l8t day of April 1866 ' 114. Hie terms of this declaration were telegraphed to the Bombay Gov ernment by Colonel Pelly for approval, and on being communicated to the Foreign Office at Simla, the Government of India replied that they ' agreed to Colonel Pelly coming to a friendly arrangement with the Wahabi Eepresen- tative, provided that any payment from the Maskat Government shall be as arranged between that Government and the Wahabi, and not guaranteed by the British Government. ' Colonel Pelly '' it was added ' can give his good offices in arranging the details of an agreement between the two parties subject to the above condition, but no Treaty between the British Government and the Wahabi Chief can be made without our seeing the full details, and without the sanction of the Home Government.' Before this reply reached Colonel Pelly he again telegraphed :—' I am, I think, enabled to state that Govern ment can dictate any consistent demands and relative positions they like, and that they will be accepted by both the Arab States, but it is on all accounts desirable that I should be favoured with definite instructions, as early as may be convenient.' In answer to this intimation the Government of India referred to their previous reply, adding that ' no definite instructions could be given, and that Colonel Pelly could make suggestions after consultation with the Wahabi Agent as he may think fit, which the Government of India will duly consider on hearing the opinion of the Bombay Government on the subject.' 115. On receipt of these instructions Colonel Felly had another interview with the VVah.ibi Envoy who signified that he 4 ' acceded in all respects to the wishes of Her Majesty's Government, and that if any difficulties should arise as to the tribute payment from Maskat, the Amir would solicit the good offices of the Besident.' Colonel Pelly then handed to him a letter to the address of the Wahabi Chief, of which the following is a copy :— 'I have received your Highness^ friendly letter by the hand of your confidential servant Mabomed bin Abdullah bin Mana and suite. *' You state that your desire is for peace, and your Envoy has handed to me a paper, copy of which I&gt; enclose, and which has been approved by Her Majesty's Governmeut. ' If difficulties should hereafter arise as to the payment to be made to you by Maskat, the English Government do not wish to interfere or become guarantee in a matter which concerns you and the Sultan. But the English Government would not object to my using my good offices in arranging the details of an agreement, and your Envoy informs me that in the contingency of such question arising, you will write and request my good offices. 'Mn one of your previous letters you refer to the question of religion. The religion of the Wahabis lies between themselves, their Imam and their God, and the English Govern ment have no wish to interfere therein. ' I hope this may find you ia health, and if you have any difficulty send me a confiden tial Agent, and I shall always be happy to meet him on iriendly terms as I have Mahomed bin Abdullah bin Mana ' 116. In reportins: to Government the result of his final interview with the Wahabi Envoy, Colonel Pelly wrote ' I asked the Wahabi Envoys what the Amir meant by stating in his letters that Politic.! a. J„„e 1866. No.. 64.66. agreements tad existed of old between his Got- ernment and the British. The Envovs replied that the Wahabi Amirs had. from time to time, received friendly letters from the British authorities, and that the Wahabi Governmeut considers a friendly letter to be synunymous with a Treaty awreement.'' ' Before leaving, the Wahabi Envoys explained to me that the present Wahabi Amir had many enemies, and difficulties to contend with, and trusted that I would not credit reports that might be made to his prejudice. I replied, that I was well aware of the critical position of the Wahabi Government, and knew that it had powerful enemies, as well at home as on its frontier, and these difficulties appeared to me as supplying additional reasons for the Wahabi Government remaining peaceably within its own territories and consolidatino- itself. For the rest, if the Wahabi Amir desired any further communication, he could forward it in writing, when it would be duly transmitted by me to higher authority.' 117. The Government of India expressed the following views on Colonel Political a ., June 1866, No. 66. Pelly s report in their letter No. 602, dated 11th June 1866, to the Bombay Government:—31 ' In reply, I am desiivd to intimate that tlie conciliatory spirit shown by the 'WahaM Envoy is satisfactory. The Governor Cieneral in Council hopes that it will enable Lieutenant- Colonel Pelly to btm» the differences between the Wahabi Kuler and the State of Muskat to a satisfactory conclusion. With regard to our own causes of complaint against the Wahabis, His Excellency in Council authorises the Resident, after hearing all that can be said both on behalf of the British subjects injured at Sur, and also by the Wahabis in justification of their proceedings, to u-e his own discretion in coming to terms with the Envoy as to the amount of compensation that may be reasonably demanded. But in both cases the Government of India entirely concurs with the Government of v ^ ^ Bombay in discountenancing Lieutenant-Colonel •see paragraph P e l!y s snggestion that the interf.reace of the Turkish Government should be invoked. No good, but much harm, would result from the question of Turkish supremacy over the Wahabi Territory being imported into our relations with the latter* power. It has always been our policy (see* letter from Her Britannic Majesty's Consul-General at Bagdad, to onr Ambassador at Constantinople, dated / the 1st Januar y 1862) . to repudiate the Porte's claim to authority in that quarter; and the Governor-General in Council is satisfied that any deviation from the principle will give rise to complications much to be deprecated/' XXVII.—Deputation of a Wahabi Envoy to Baghdad, 1866. 118. 'While one Envoy was deputed by the Amir of Nejd to Colonel Pelly, another was sent by him to the Turkish Political A. June 1866, Nos. 26-27. Governor-General at Baghdad. The object of this latter deputation is explained in the letter of the British Consul at Baghdad (Colonel Kemball), No. 15, dated 18th April 1866 ' I have the honour to report to your Excellency the arrival at Baghdad, on the 29th March^ of Abdul Aziz es-Sawevlim, Envoy from Amir Abdulla ibn Fevsal-al-Saud, the Wahabi Kuler. His mission and ifo nature had been announced to me by H»r Majesty's Vice-Consul at Bussorah, but here he was for some time represented to be merely in charge of four Nejdi horses to be preseutpd to the Sultan ; and in this character, #.steusibly, I understand, Namik Pasha proposes that he should prosecute his journey to Constantinople. ' A few days ago, howover, His Excellency intimated to me, through his confidential Secre' tary, that Abdul Aziz was also charged with a letter from his master complaining of the aggres sions of the English upon the coasts of Nejd, and its dependencies, and soliciting Turkish intervention against their recurrence At the same time His Excellency sent me the draft of a note which he^proposed to address to me inviting me to telegraph to the Governor-General of India to suspend further hostile operations (rumoured) to be under contemplation until the subject of quarrel could be discussed between the two Governments; or, if this course were impracticable, asking my opinion as to the propriety of his despatching a telegiam in his own name, in tho same sense, to the Governor-General, ' In reply, I stated to His Excellency that Abdul Aziz not having done me the honour to . advise me of his vi^it to Baghdad, I could, of course, form no judgment of the causes and grounds of his mission, but assumed it, as reported, to be devoid of political object; and that, with respect to the relations of his master with the Turkish Government, as my previous correspondence, with His Excellency had been duly submitted by me both to Your Lordship and to the British Indian Government, while, on the other hand, His Excellency had advanced no additional facts or arguments, even in the form of Amir Abdullah s letter, to support the position he had taken up, 1 did not consider myself justified, were such a step within my province, to act upon His Excellency's suggestion, nor could 1 see any advantage iu himself pursuing a course so unusual 119. In his letter No. 16, dated 7th May 1866, the Consul-General at Baghdad reported the result of the depata- Political A, June 1866, Nos. 91-93. ^ gball quote the whole Mter% which throws much side light upon Turkish aims against Arabia even as early as 1866 :— ' The Wahabi Envoy, Abdul Aziz-es-Soweylim, in lieu of proceeding to Constantinople has been dismissed by Nainik Pasha. He accordingly left Baghdad on the 3rd instant on hi' return to Nejd.32 c&lt; This sudden change of the policy on the part of Namik Pasha was announced to me by His Excellency in person on the same day, when 1 could perceive that His Excellency's views t ., A —-I* r ^ n * * , , . and sentiments wilh respect to the alleged con- lam aware that His excellency appealed by tele- . „ . T , 7 . . . r . . . -r, . , graph to Her Majesty's Minister at'i'eheran through nection 01 tliP V\ ahablS with thfi xorte had the Turkish Minister there to cause the suspension undergone considerable modification; and whereas of ope ations against Katif. j^tore loudly asserted the rightful suzerainty of the Sultan over Nejd, he now spoke of that connection in terms of indifference, if not of aversion. ' The ostensible ground of Abdul Aziz's dismissal was the inferiorifcy of his rank for the conduct of so important a mission, but at the same time His Excellpncy admitted that the letters he had received from Amir Abdullah bin Feysul were ambiguously worded ; and he enlarged upon the treacherous and ambitious character of that Chief, as well as upon the impracticability, as evinced by the failure of the Egyptians to maintain the occupation of the country, of enforcing an allegiance which, being professed under momentary pressure, would only be observed by him so long as it suited his purpose. ' The facts I conjecture to be that Amir Abdullah, when urged by the Authorities of Bussorah to be more explicit in his communications, not only evaded compliance, but signified his repudiation of Turkish supremacy by despatching Envoys to Bushire to treat directly with the British Resident; while, on the other band, the Ottoman Ministry at Constantinople, so far from concurring in the views of Namik Pasha, has probably pointed out to His Excellency the inexpediency of extending to more remote tribes and principalities in Arabia that condition of ^s?-dependence which is found only too onerous and embarrassing in the case of the Bedouin tribes, whose peculiar status within Turkish limits cannot be ignored. &lt;f Other disquieting rumours, too, may. I think, have influenced Namik Pasha. Some time after the arrival of Abdul Aziz-es-Soweylim at Baghdad accounts were reoeived that Amir Abdullah had himself appeared at Koweit at the head of a considerable force, variously stated at 5,0n0 and ]0,000 men. He had, it seems, marched to Jebel Shammer in order to surprise two Bed ouin tribes, the Dhefye and a branch of the Anezeh, deriving from (subsidized by) the Baghdad Government, who usually encamp at this season on the Nejd border, from whom during his father's lifetime the zekat, or tithe in token of submission, had been repeatedly claimed, and to punish whose depredations on Wahabi territory was the professed object of the expedition. It has not transpired in what manner the Montefig from Sukesh Shiwkh became involved in the quarrel; but in his pursuit of the Dbefye, Amir Abdullah came into ^collision with a combined force of both of these tiibes, whom according to the reports first received by Namik Pasha and myself, he defeated with great slaughter, capturing from them many horses and dromedaries. On the receipt of this intelligence His Excellency telegraphed to the Governor of Bussorah, desiring him to call upon Amir Abdullah, now baited near Koweit, to suspend further operations, deprecating hostilities between tribes subordinate to the same authority, and recommending the mutual restitution of plunder as the basis of accommodation; but since the departure of Amir Abdullah from Koweit on his return to Kiad, His Excellency has professed to believe that the reports first received were ill founded, and he adduces the arrival of 10 Nejd horses and as many dromedaries, selected by the Montifig chief, Sheikh Fuhud, from the spoils of the Wahahis, f( r presentation to His Excellency, as proof of the victory gained by the Turkish tribes. I append c&lt; py of a further report of the part : culars of the affairs which I received from Mr. Johnst on yesterday evening. It is interesting as illus trating the normal condition of the Nejd Frontier.^ XXVIII.—Wahabi advances on Eeraymi, 1870—1871. 120. During the contest for power in Maskat, between Sayud Azan-bin- Gheis and Sayud Salim, Sideyn, the Wahabi Lieutenant of Beravmi was pledged to the side of Syud Salim. He was murdered, however by the Chief of Shargah on 7th April 1870. On his death the Nairn tribe, who com plained bitterly of oppression suffered at the hands of Sideyri the late Wahabi Lieutenant, resolved in their minds how they could free themsplvp« from the Wahabi yoke, and resorted to the expedient of inviting Azan to take possession of Beraymi. Azan and his adviser Khuleli not beino- the men to allow the grass to grow under feet, the offer of the Nairn was accepted The proceedings of Azan were most probably hastened by a peremptory demand made on him by the Wahabis for payment of tribute. At any rate, the result was that Azan marched on Beraymi with about 1,500 men, and took it on the loth oi J une after a very slight resistance.33 121. On 2nd August Colonel Disbrowe wrote ;— u So far as I can see and judge, Beraymi was gratuitously and unjustly invaded by Syud Azan and Azan must look for Waliabi retaliation As was anticipated by Colonel Disbrowe, the Wababis soon took steps to retaliate. 122. On 29tli January 1870 tbe Bombay Government telegraphed :— 'The Gulf mail just in leaves little room for doubting tliat the Wahabis are actually on tbe march for Baraymi. It seems also that they have prepared boats, loosely stated at 100j to co-operate with land force. We have only Clyde in the Gulf and Dalhousie at Maskat. I shall send Colonel Pelly back jn the Dryad, if possible, as soon as she can be got ready.' • Tel. No. 230-P., ?th Feb. 1870. 123. The Bombay Government were asked*— ' Have you any information to show where Wahabi boats are likely to start from, and where likely to land ? Is coast line and country between Kateef and A boo Debai allied with, or feudatory of, Amir of Eiad, «r are tribes inhabiting it quite independent. Can you quote any precedent for our interference in Persian Gulf between two States who are not parties to maritime truce V 124. This was answered on the 10th February:— 'The 'Wahabi boats are likely to start, some from Kateef, which is a Wahabi port, and others from the Guttur Coast, and to land at some point between Abuthabi and Shargah. The chief port of the Guttur Geast in Wukra, belonging to the Chief, Mahomed-bin-Saleh, who may be said to be independent, though he pays an annual sum to Bahrein, a portion of which goes to the Wahabi Amir. 'Shargah belongs to the Joasmi tribe who, as regards religious tenets, approach nearly to the Wahabis, though politically they are independent. The Beniyas tribe inhabiting the coast line adjacent to Abuthabi would not appear to be allied or feudatory to the Wahabis. The Chief of Abuthabi, who is at the head of the .Beniyas, has always been closely allied in interest to the Syud Saeed branch of Maskat. The Beniyas tribe are stronger on land than the Joasmis, and, therefore, exercise considerable influ ence over the surrounding Bedouin tribes, but the Joastnis are more powerful at sea. ' The British Government has always been adverse to the extension of Wahabi influence in Oman. No precedent can be cpoted of actual interference between the Maskat and Waha bi powers by our Government, but it has always lent a moral support to Maskat in the differ ences of that State with the Wababis by sending vessels of war to the Arab Coast when hos tilities threatened, and in one instance (in 1865-66 when the late Syud Thoweynee undertook to resist the Wahabi Amir) guns and material of war were supplied to the Sultan by our Government. 'The latter policy of the Indian Government has been, however, to forbid operations by sea in the Persian Gulf or Gulf of Oman to any power whatsoever. 'In June 1^68 the late Viceroy directed the prevention by force of any operation by Maskat against Persia, and, of course, would similarly have resisted any operation by Persia against Maskat. Similarly the Zanzibar Sultan has been told that operations by sea against Maskat would not be permitted, and the Government at Maskat has been prevented attempting to regain Gwadur and Charbar. The maritime truce affects only the smaller Chiefs on the Littoral; neither Maskat, Persia, nor the Amir of Riad are parties to it.' 125. The following on the 7th February came from Bombay :— ' Following telegram received :—' Wahabi force approaching Maskat. Tribes in Jaalan southward are generally holding back. Appears at present doubtful if Azan can raise any suffi cient opposing force/ Telegram ends. My instructions of February 3rd were, to observe strict neutrality between contending parties, and to interfere with no operations by laud, as force only sent to protect British subjects and property, and to maintain maritime truce by force if necessary; if thought necessary to alter these instructions, it will be best to do so at once, as three days will be lost in going to Jask, which is 150 miles beyond Maskat. Bulljinch reported to be ready on Wednesday.' These instructions to Captain Douglas were approved, 126. Major Way, writing from Maskat on January 21st, reported that men and money were being collected but slowly by Azan-bin-Gheis, who was endea vouring to recruit in Burka. His firm adherents, Ibrahim-bin-Gheis and Sheikh. Salih, were at the same place, but their success was no better than their Chiefs. A rumour had reached him, for which he could not vouch, that the Boni-boo* Ali, against whom the Imam was lately victorious in Jaalan, had again rebelled had rescued some men of their tribe who had been taken prisoners, and hadrefused to co -operate witli the Imam against the 'Wababis. A translation of a letter is also sent, in which the Amir of Nejd communicated to Syud Salem, the Ex-Imam, his advance against Oman, and promised to reinstate him. ^rom the date of this letter, which must have travelled, if authentic, from the Amir's camp through Kishm to Maskat in three days, Colonel Pelly was inclined to doubt the fact of its having emanated from the Wahabi Amir, and inclined to the belief that it was the handiwork of Syud Salem or of Haji Ahmed. Major Way could not state the position of the Wahabi Army at the time that he wrote, all he knew being that it had left Hasa. Colonel Pelly, writing at Bombay on the 31st of January, on the strength of information received from Gwadur and Bushire, represented it as being at Katar, and Sheikh Saleh as being in Jaalan. Azan-bin-Gheis, he added, was endeavouring to obtain the support of the Chief of Abuthabi. This Chief was, unlike the rulers of jSTejd and Oman, a signatory of the mari time truce. His principal port was well-situated for the landing of troops intended to operate against Beraymi, and preparations were on foot at Kateef for an expedition by sea to co-operate with the land forces. 127. Another report, to which Major Way was not able to attach full credence, tras that an amnesty had been granted to all of the Nairn tribe who might return to their allegiance to the Wahabis. This was the tribe for whose protection against Wahabi aggression Azan-bin-Gheis took up arms last year and stormed Beraymi. Khulelee by the latest account was at Maskat. » xt „ , ^ ^ „ v 128. The Bombay Government forward- * No. 55, dated 14th February 1870. jsKPii n/rix • ix-i ed ¥ further Maskat news in detail:— 'According 1 to Sheikh Nasepr, the Wahabi force, variously computed at two to five thousand men, and again at ten thousand men, was within five days of Beraymi. Azan-bin- Gheis had met with no support from the fighting tribes of ihe south. He had with him certainly not more than two thousand men. Some were inclined to put the strength of hig followers so low as six hundred. The Chiefs from Ras-el-Khyma to Debaye were not hostile to the Wahabi Amir; the Chief of Abuthabi, though suspected of playing a double game, was likely to remain neutral. It was expected that the invaders would experience no check at Beraymi. In such case their next move would be in all probability to Sohar, and thence a passage by sea to Maskat might be attempted. To prevent such an attempt, Major Way urged on the Bombay Government the necessity of letting him retain the Dalhousie, which the latter had telegraphed for, if her presence was not absolutely required at Maskat. The Amir had ordered at Katar a hundred vessels from his own coast, for the embarkation of his troops. Syud Salem had expressed his intention of joioing the Wahabis, but had not by the latest account left Kishm.' 129. This information was sent to the Secretary of State in No. 17 of 22nd February 1870. Inter alia, it briefly recapitulated tbe events 'The advance of the Wahabi Amir upon Beraymi, as reported in the enclosures of this despatch, has somewhat altered the complexion of affairs. According to the latest report which we have received from Maskat, dated February 4th, the Amir of Riad had left Lahsa with a force probably not less than two thousand, or more than five thousand men, and wa^ within five days' march of Beraymi. He had granted an amnesty to all the Naeem tribe of Beraymi who may return to their allegiance to the Wahabis, and had declared his inten tion of marching on the town of Maskat itself after reducing Beraymi. At the latter place it was anticipated that he would meet no che^k. The Chiefs from Ras-el-Khyma to Debaye had shown no signs of hostility to the Wahabis. Syud Salem had expressed his intention of joining the Amir's army, but by the latest account had not left Kishm. On the other hand, it is reported that Azan-bin-Gheis has not been successful in collecting men and money, and that the Chief of Abuthabi, on whose support he had counted, was likely to remain neutral. It is also rumoured that the Beni-boo-Ali, against whom Azan was lately victorious in Jaalan, have rebelled and refused to co-operate with him against the Wahabis.' 130. Colonel Pelly, then at Government House, Calcutta, on the receipt of telegram from Maskat, reported (22nd Pebruary 1870):— &lt;s On the whole, the Maskat Wahabi quarrel seems to be approaching its solution. And I would respectfully suggest that I return to the Gulf with all convenient speed, and with des- cretionary power to recognise Azan or otherwise, according as circumstances may seem to require; any recognition should be in writing, and should explicitly declare all questions of detail. Treaty, Convention, or claim to territory, to be reserved for subsequent discussion. Meantime, I would propose addressing the subjoined telegrams to Major Smith and the Assistant Resident at Bushire.35 * ( To Major Smith, Angaum : 'Proceed with Kwangtung to Bahrein and rendezvous Clyde 1 doubt the Amir molesting. If he do, prevent any boats arriving touching- the island. I£ absolutely necessary, address a letter by direction to Amir informing him that I am instructed to maintain the maritime peace, and am embarking for the Arab coast. If all seem quiet at Bahrein, have Clyde there and proceed in Kwangtung along Arab coast, warning all parties against breach of truce, and informing them of my approach, from Arab coast return to Angaum and report, and look out for mail steamer/ ' 131. These instructions were approved, and Colonel Pelly was requested to proceed to the Persian Gulf with all convenient speed, and invested with dis cretionary power to recognize Azan bin Gheis or otherwise as circumstances might seem to require, but with the explicit reservation of all questions of detail, Treaty, Convention, or claim to territory, as suggested, and provided that the advantage of Azan's recognition were not neutralized by this reservation. (Reported to Secretary of State in No. 19, 15th March 1870). 132. On 5th March Major Way telegraphed :— 'Maskat quiet. Syud Azan writes, 1st March, from Beraymi, ' Sheikh Zaeed of Abu- thabi has arrived and sworn friendship and promised to oppose Wahabis. Mahomed Ali Naeem sworn allegiance and promised Littoral Chiefs should visit me at Sohar. Sha'nt visit coast, but shall return to Sohar when arrangements finished for protection of Beraymi. Wa habis appear to be still at Katar. Not believed here that Wahabis can now come by land, and half of war tax has been returned. Can't say at this distance if attempt will be made by sea. Amulgavine Chief's cousin and Wahabi emissaries arrived at Kishm, and Syud Salem left for Amulgavine with them on 23rd/ ' 133. On 21st March Colonel Pelly wrote :— 'All accounts concur in stating that the Wahabi Amir is still tt his own fort of Ojair as already submitted. His Highness probably hesitates to leave the Abuthabi Chief in bis rear, and his advance is, no doubt, rendered more difficult through the want of rain and consequent proverty of drinking water along the line of march. 'The alliance between the Abuthabi Chief and Syud Azan, and the^fact of the latter's return to Maskat, tend to show that Azan's position is increasingly strong/'' 134. On 2nd April 1870 Colonel Pelly telegraphed:— &lt;l Wababi Amir still in his own territories. Doubt if he will attempt Beraymi this year. Bahrein procepdings have had good effect. All quiet down to date. Clyde still a Bahrein watching Wahabis/' 135. Colonel Pelly reported on 8th April (in No. 147 from Bombay Go vernment, 25th April 1870);— 'The Wahabis. It appears that some months ago the Wahabi Amir cpllected his forces in the neighbourhood of Hasa with intent to attack Beraymi. He communicated with the Chiefs of the Littoral as per margiuj in view to their co-operation or neutrality, and these Chiefs, with the exception of Abuthabi, returned conciliatory answers, but the Wahabi Amir was deterred from further movement by the following considerations ' That rain not having fallen, water and grass were not available for his horses and meu along the line of march; ' That the combination of the Abuthabi Chief with the Maskat Sultan rendeied the march more hazardous ; ' 3rdly. That the Amir, conscious of having harboured one of the Bahrein'pirates and of having received the Bahrein plunder in his territories, feared that, sooner oi later, we should demand satisfaction from him at his ports—Ojair and Kateef; and ' 4^%.—In a minor degree, the Amir was suspicious of intrigue on the part of his relatives at his capital, Riadh. 'Influenced by the above considerations, the Wahabi Amir refrained from marching, and the season is now so advanced that it is doubtful if he will attempt anything this year. The most recent report is to the effect that he is already returning towards bis capital. 136. On 7th May 1870 Colonel Pelly continued :— 'Several communications I have recently received concur m stating that the Amir him self has returned to his capital, and that Nasir-bin-Mobarek, the pirate Chief, who escaped from Bahrein, has sustained a defeat at the hands of certain of the inland Wahabi tribes, borne of the reports allege that Nasir-bin -Mobarek himself was killed in the fight, while other reports are to the effect that he fled, and that nothing certain had since been heard ot him. « p 5 Since writing the above I have received a letter from the Bahrein Chief, in which he states that Nasir-bin-Mobarek was killed. It appears further that the defeat of his tnba (the Howajir) was complete.'36 * XXIX—(1) Civil War between Abdullah and Saud his brother- (2) The Turkish expedition into Nejd to assist Abdullah, 1870- 1872. 137. Amir Abdullah bad to abandon the prosecution of bis war against Oman ; for be bad to face a more powerful enemy at borne, bis own brother Saud. 138. Abdullab ibn Eeysal's character was never such as to win him much affection Jrom the warlike iiomad tribes, who constitute the fighting power of the Nejd. In early manhood, when heir apparent and practically regent for bis blind father, be showed some energy and ability as a leader of raids, but what popularity he then enjoyed was far exceeded by that of his brother Saud, the beau-ideal of an Arab prince—handsome, reckless, frank and open-handed! On their father, Eeysal's death in 1865, the inevitable contest began between the brothers for the Amirship. It lasted until 1870, when Abdullah, finally defeated, sought the aid of the hated, and, as the Wahabis of Nejd hold, infidel Turks. The result was that a Turkish expedition under Midhat Pasha,' Vali of Baghdad, proceeding from Basrah by sea, occupied, with Abdullah's aid, the Hasa district of the Sejdean Principality. 139. In June 1871 the Turkish expeditionary force, consisting of 4,000 or 5,000 regular troops under command of Naiiz Pasha, disembarked at' Katif and marched unopposed to Hasa. In July 1871 the Sheikh of Koweit was sent bearing the Turkish flag to Bidaa on the Katar Coast, and the Arab Sheikhs induced to accept it. Abdullah bin Eeysal bad in the meantime won over the Beni-Kahtan tribe and, with their assistance, bad engaged Saud west of Riadh, but was again worsted and joined the Turkish camp in Hasa. The in habitants of Riadh, displeased at the overbearing conduct of Sand's Bedouin followers, now rose under the leadership of Abdullah bin Turki, and forced Saud to retire to Katar. Abdullab bin Turki then wrote to Nafiz Pasha and Abdullah bin Fey sal, reporting that he bad expelled Saud and requesting orders. In reply, Nafiz Pasha appointed him ' Mudir ' of Riadh pending the arrival there of Abdullah bin Feysal, and sent him money and provisions to aid him in holding the place. Saud next collected a force of the Ajman and Morrah and Dowasir Bedouins and attacked the Turks in Hasa, but sustained a defeat 140. It was not long ere the Turkish authorities ceased, even in appearance to act on behalf of Abdullab bin Feysal. It was alleged that the chief people of Hasa bad addressed a petition to the Sultan praying His Majesty to take Nejd under the direct rule and appoint a Turkish Governor instead of a member of the Al-Saud family. The Hasa notables certainly maintained that thev were under the impression that the petition they signed related to the assess ment of the date groves, etc., but in November Midat Pasha appeared personally in Hasa bearing a gracious and favourable reply to the said petition. A noti fication was issued that the ' Al-Saud has ceased to reign,' and that Natiz Pasha was appointed Muteserrif or Governor of Nejd ; whereupon Abdullah bin Eeysal tied from the Turkish camp to Riadh. , ^H 1 \^ tt )!® C . omme ? cementof 1872 ' tlie Turks h ad possessed themselves of the fertile district and ports of Hasa and were reported to have collected secret, May 1872, No. 6G. materials for the construction of forts at Bas Tanurab, Giair, and Bremph half way between the latter place and Hasa, as a means of keeping open'their communication with the sea. The true nature of their policy in Neid was now beginning to dawn upon Abdullah bin Peysal, who after escaping from their camp to Ins capital at liiadh, was said to have addressed a letter to the Somt, M«y 1871. No. 62. lurkish authorities complaining that ,, j , ,, ... though they had entered his countrv With the avowed intention of restoring him to power, they had practioallv put him under restraint and purposed supplanting his dynasty and substituting their own authority. Other circumstances combined to favour the idea hat they were determined at all hazards to occupy the country permanently. e«ret. May 1871, No. 68 and 7s. ^ ' l0 Governor of Hasa issued proclam- #tions by which he claimed the right37 of disposing of landed property there and promised advances without interest to landowners, assuring the people that the Sultan would not allow them to again become subjects of the sons of Feysal, and would afford due protection both in person and property to all those, who might desire to go on pilgrimage. Nor did Midhat Pasha relax his efforts to keep up the military strength of the Turks. The mortality amongst the troops at Khatif was excessive: . several hundreds of invalids arrived in ecre, »y , o. . ^ deplorable condition at Baghdad, and their accounts of the state of those left behind were most depressing, but he showed no signs of relinquishing his aggressive policy and continued to pour in reinforcements at the risk of completely denuding Baghdad of troops. 142. At the commencement of 1872 Saud bin Feysal was said to be hovering about the neighbourhood of Katar with a small body of Bedouins and to be in communication with his brother Abdullah, who was then at Eiadh, but ap- v \i , D -« ^ parently losing what hold he still Secret, May 1872, No, 66. 1 , i7 nc r-i-i * possessed over the affections of the people of Nejd. Both seem to have been much straitened for provisions and water and quite unable singly to cope with the Turks. Rumours of a reconcilia tion between them were rife, the first overtures having been made by Abdullah, c xt who distrusted the Turks. Saud consented ecre, ay , o. . ^ proposals, but the coali- tion bad no permanency, and the danger and embarrassment to which the Turks would have been exposed by the effective union of the brothers, who were reported to have collected a force of Seorel, June 187», No. 120. ,i,rVw*A i a i 40,000 men and to be meditating a simultaneous attack on Khatif and Hasa, was averted by a renewal of their mutual jealousy and distrust; one of the principal causes of this in all pro- ^ nr xt bability was a treacherous attack by eor«, »y 87 , o.

There are many references in the newsgleanings from the Persian Gulf to Saud's wish to enter into o x n « ,r.&gt; negotiations with j:he Turks, while they Secret, leb. 1872, No. 169. 0 ., j x i -ri. xi j were quite prepared to shirt the ground of their original argument for interference in Nejd affairs and come to terms with the man whose expulsion as the usurper of his brother's rights was the alleged object of their invasion of the country. Before describing these negotiations, an attempt made by Saud to procure the mediation of the British Government, and the correspondence which arose out of it, may be noticed. XXX.—Saud's appeal to the Eesident for the arbitration of the British Government, 1871—1872. 144. In September 1871 Saud remonstrated, in a letter to the Eesident in the Persian Gulf, against the hostile action of the Turks in the Gulf waters, _ , . owo XT ursjin^ that he considered the peace of Secret, March 1872, No. 262. jt v j. i j d -j.* i these waters to be under Bntisn protection, and soliciting the arbitration of that Government. The Bombay Government « , , QC „ „ directed the Resident to inform Saud that Secret, March 1862, No 249. , i «. ^ j.' it was impossible to offer arbitration without some assurance that it would be accepted by both parties, but they at38 i the same time represented to the Government of India the very serious result the Turkish Expedition might have in lessening British influence in the Gulf from the fact of its having been conveyed by sea. ' It cannot be expected that the tribes of the Littoral should understand the principle by which they are precluded from undertaking the smallest military operation by sea, while at the same time the Turks are permitted to send an expedition like the present. ' They were therefore of opinion that the necessity of an offer of arbitration, or rather of good offices, which Saud seemed prepared to accept, should be strongly urged on the Secretary of State. The mischievous effects of the Nejd Expedition on the British position in the Gulf had been more than once pointed out to the Secretary of State for India, and his attention was again drawn to the subject Secret, Marcb 1872. No. 257. by the transmission to him of the letter Secret, Match 1872, Koi, asy-aee. of the Bombay Government above re ferred to. 145. Saud again wrote to the Political Resident on the 22nd June 1872 as follows ' The Government ordered you to tell me that the friendship between the Secret.October 1872. No.. 81-82. Government and me was firm. I never doubted this. I know this from afore time. The frendship between you and me was on two accounts—because we had been friends a long time; 2nd, that my country was safe from attack except from the seaside. I know that you are paramount at sea, and knowing the sea to be under your orders I was at ease in my country of Nejd. I made no arrangement for defending the sea-coast, but I thought that you were watching over the sea, and no one could come, I hope that you will be watchful of all things under your power, because it is your custom to always give help and watch over people's interest/* 146. On the 6th March 1873, he wrote— ' I trusted and was easy as regards the sea-coast in reliance to your an- PoiiticaiA, July 1879, Noi. 10M09. swer, the sea being in your charge and protection. I seek aid in two ways, for t ie bnkar helps those who seek it from them or cast themselves on them. 'The sea is under charge of the Resident and I was careless about the sea owing to his word. I am at peace as regards the sea owing to his word, as he will not consent to disturbance at sea, and the Sirkar helps those who seek it and ask for.it. They are bound to keep peace.' 147. A fourth communication on this subject to Colonel Pellv. who had then left the Gulf, dated 18th May 1873, was as under— ' I have received from you several letters assuring me of peace at sea, and I felt convinced that I was in security and under your protection and that of the Sirkar. But the Government (Turkish) attacked me by sea. I then informed you of this fact and begged for a reply, and understood from your replies that you had my interests under consideration and would com municate again. ' You know that the whole of the people of these parts consider that this Gulf is protected by you and under your supervision. Such being the case it is not possible for you to keep silent in this matter, and must call them to account for infringing the peace of the sea.' 148. The Government of India informed the acting Resident that unless Secret. October 1878, No. 44i. Saud was o, party to the so-called Marim _ time Truce^ or hod otherwiBe received assurances from the British Government the was mistaken in supposing that the British Government had undertaken to protect his territories from attack by sea. As far as His Excellency in Council was then informed Saud bin Fevsal was neither a party to the Truce nor had he received any assurances of pro tection. The Resident was to report as to whether anything had been said89 or done at any time to commit the British Qorernment directly or indirectly to defend him or to use their influence to prevent attacks being made on him by sea: if no such obligation existed the 'Resident was to answer Saud's letter in general terms pointing out that he was mistaken in supposing that the British Gov- ernmeat had undertaken to defend him from the sea, and adding a hope that he would soon be able to come to an amicable Political. February 1874, No. no. understanding with the Turkish Govern ment. 149. The report thus called for, showed that Saud was not a party to the Maritime Truce, and that the British Government had been in no way committed to protect him by sea. The answers of the Resident to his letters had been written in general terms, and it was probable that the expressions in his letter of the 18th May 1873 44 were prompted merely by the vague hopes and wishes so often entertained by semi-barbarous Chiefs in similar situa tions.' Later communications from S iud showed that he had been undeceived as to the policy of the British Government and merely hoped for its good wishes and friendship. Under these cir- Poiiticai, February 1874, No. 212. cumstanoes His Excellency in Council left it to the discretion of the Resident to answer Saud's letter of the 18th May 1873 either then or afterwards in general terms expressive of good will; should he again revert to the existence of any such • assurance of security, matters were to be explained to him in such a way as to remove any existing misunderstanding which he n\ight display and prevent the possibility of mis understanding in the future. XXXI.—Saud's negotiations with the Turks, 1872. 150. To return to Saud's negotiations with the Turks, the terms of this understanding were reported to be his Secret, May 1872,No#. 80-88. recognition as Chief of Nejd on the con. dition of his paying the Turkish war expenses and the same yearly tribute that Feysal had paid. Two of his sons were to be sent to Baghdad as hostages, he was to consider himself as a tributary of the Porte and not to exercise any authority on the sea-board. If these terms did not suit him, he was to come to Hasa when the Turkish Government would restore to him his father's pro- perty and grant him a pension of a thousand dollars per mensem: these con ditions would be fulfilled six months after his acceptance of them and on ascertaining that 'he had served faithfully and given up all thoughts of opposition.' Both parties professed their anxiety for a meeting to settle the terms of the arrangement, and letters were constantly passing between Ferik Pasha, Governor of Hasa, and Saud. The prevalent belief was that the Pasha's object in arranging this meeting was to effect the capture of Saud, but the latter's suspicions were aroused by the imprisonment of his friend, Sheikh Rohim, Chief of the El Ejman tribe, by the Turks; nothing was thero- fore settled, and Ferik Pasha was shortly afterwards recalled leaving behind him a character for leniency in his dealings with the people which for the time went far towards reconciling them to Turkish rule; but he was succeeded by another Eerik Pasha, whose oppressive conduct joined to the exactions of the soldiery very soon obliterated the secret, Apni is/a, No. 75. favourable impression made by His predecessor. XXXII—First Mission of Haji Ahmed to Baghdad, 1872. 151. Saud, however, did not abandon his hopes of effecting some settle ment with the Turkish authorities, and after his failure to secure the arbitra tion of the British Government addressed Haji Ahmed Khan, formerly Minister at Maskat, and who was then at Secret, August 1S72, No, 179. Bushire, on the subject. Haji Ahmed communicated Saud's wishes to the Besident and producted a letter fromthe former investing him with full powers of mediation with the Turks. By the advice of the Resident, Haji Ahmed communicated with the Turkish Consul at Bushire. The matter was then referred to the Governor-General of Turkish Arabiaj Rauf Pasha, who had now succeeded Midhat Pasha, and in due course Haji Ahmed was summoned to Baghdad. He left Bushire on 5th July 1872 accompanied by the Turkish Consul, who had assured the Resident that the Turkish authorities were desirous of coming to a settlement with Saud; a statement which the chief Turkish official at Basrah repeated to Haji Ahmed. The Resident thought that Rauf Pasha was inclined to counteract his predecessor's policy in Nejd, and that the retirement of the Turks from 'VYahabi territory and the appointment of Saud as a tributary of Turkey with a guarantee of his good faith in the shape of hostages to reside at Baghdad would probably form the basis of the negotiations. The chief difficulties to the apprehended were the possible reluctance of Saud to trust Secret, October 1872, Nog. 78-79, himself in iurkish hands in order to conduct his negotiations with Haji Ahmed, the question of hostages, and the possibility of the negotiation not being completed before the departure of Rauf Pasha who had been recalled. Haji Ahmed arrived at Baghdad and telegraphed to the Resident, who had been directed not to interfere in the negotiations, that he had come to an understanding with the Pasha and was about to proceed to the Wahabi coast m order to carry into effect the terms of the arbitration; but although he secret, October 187«, No. so. described his negotiations as successful, , the Pasha evidently insisted much on e presence of a hostage on the part of Saud.

The Political Agent, Turkish Arabia, in noticing their secret, Apni 1873, Nof. 62-64. arrival and that of a rival messenger from Abdullah bin Eeysal on a similar errand, mentioned that though no definite arrangements had been made, Rauf Pasha had written to Saud encouraging him to hope for the sanction of the Porte to his nomination as Kaim Mukam of Nejd, but stating that the Turkish troops would not be withdrawn from Hasa. He thought that if the Porto were to recognize Saud on his under taking to pay a reasonable revenue, withdraw its troops from Hasa, and leave him to establish his own power, Abdullah would soon disappear from the field, tranquility would be restored to the country, at any rate for a time, while the supremacy of the Ottoman Government would be recognized. Saud 's prospects had now much improved. The capture of the Ejman Chief by the Turks had been the means of procuring him many adherents, while Abdullah 's treacherous breaches of faith, notably in his attacks on the Shammar and lijmau tribes, had alienated from him most of his former friends. Saud, who was now at the head of a large force, was said to have worsted his brother in. an engagement near Kherj and to have Secret' Aprinak NoV 45^6. * * blockaded Hiadh and plundered the sur- • political a., may 1873, nob, 162.166. ^ rounding country.

The report above alluded to was confirmed by a letter from Saud to the Resident j Abdullah was urged, by his brother, Mahomed, to make his submission to Saud, but, though too w eak to meet him in the field, he refused Political a., Jniy 1873, No. 878. ^ so gaud appears now to have remained quietly for some time in Riadh, while Abdullah continued in the neighbourhood of Koweit. 155. Farhan bin Kheirullah was not detained long at Baghdad, but Abdul Rahman was evidently looked upon by the lurkish authorities as a hostage, placed under surveillance, and apparently treated with severity, while his distress was increased by the non-payment of the small subsistance allowance which had been at one time made to him by the Local Government. In Februarv 1873, a few months after Abdul Rahman's arrival at Baghdad, Fahad bin Sintian, Saud's Agent at Hasa was arrested by the Turks and deported to Baghdad, probably in consequence of Saud's successes in Nejd, which was now , , 0(T0 XT „ reported to be entirely subject to him.

XXXIV —Visit of Abdullah's messenger to Baghdad, 1872—1873. 156 With reference to the messenser from Abdullah noticed above (para graph 13), it appears that under instruc- PoliticalA., December 1873, No. 122. ^ rom Pas^ who had SUC- cfieded Rauf Pasha, Mussur Pasha pensioned Ex Sheikh of the Montefik, wrote to Abdullah inviting him to Baghdad to confer with the Governor-General of Turkish Arabia. Abdullah in his reply, which he sent by his slave Mahbub, who was formerly Wazir to Feysal and Governor of Bereymi, but was driven out by the people of that place for his oppressive conduct, stated that he could not trust himself in the power of the Turks, repeated his complaints of their treatment of him, and instanced that of his relatives as an additional argument against his going to Baghdad. At the same time if they were really willing to aid him, they should instruct the Chiefs of Hasa and Khatif to submit to him and make over to him those districts for which he would pay42 anything they might demand. That he was ready to become the vassal of Turkey was further proved by a letter said to have been written by him to the Chief of Shargah, in which he said Political a ., Norember 1873, Nos. ii, 14, is. that if he obtained bis wishes as regards Hasa and Khatif, he would march on Oman with a view to the capture of Bereymi, where his success would doubtless be welcome to the Turkish Government. The Assistant Resident did not put much faith in the genuine ness of this letter, and later accounts agreed that Abdullah was quite unable to carry out his threat of invading Oman. 157. No arrangement seems to have been concluded with the Turks, „ _ T for on the return of Redif Pasha, who Political a ., January is 4, o. 123. ^vas not at Baghdad when Mahbub ar rived there, the Turkish policy in the Wahabi territory underwent an other change; the arrangement with either of the sons of Feysul seems to have been considered impracticable, and the Governorship of Hasa was con- ,o w xt ^ ferred upon Bezech A1 Arayer, Chief Political A., April 1874, hos. 164, 165, and 248. n j-i -d t?' i i-i, 'i- c of the Bern Khalid, on the security or his brother-in-law Nasir Pasha, Sheikh of the Montefik Arabs. The Beni Khalid were expelled from Hasa when Saud, called the First, conquered and annexed it to Nejd; their present Chief was stated by the Political Agent, Turkish Arabia, to be a man of no special qualifications for the post, which he probably owed to his connection with Nasir Pasha, who had ingratiated himself with Redif Pasha. In consequence of his appoinlment it was further decided to withdraw the regular troops and entrust the defence of the frontier between Nejd and Hasa to a body of Gendarmerie to be raised in the country for that purpose. As the result of these changes four battalions of infantry returned to Baghdad having suffered in a stay of 14 months losses varying from 16 to 25 per cent, of their total strength. It was generally supposed that Saud bin Feysal would seize this opportunity of wresting this part of his father's territories from the feeble hands in which it was now placed. The appointment of Bezech was anything but popular at Hasa and several of the chief persons there prepared a remonstrance setting forth his unfitness for the post; the only result of this was their imprisonment by Nasir Fasha. XXXV.—Eelease of Abdul Eahman bin FeysaL 1874. 158. Affairs in Nejd do not seem to have undergone any material change for the next few months until the release of Abdul Rahman, who remained in virtual captivity at Baghdad until August 1874, when he was set at liberty under the orders from the Porte, procured probably by the intervention of err 1A v fi7 the British ambassador at Constan- PohticalA., NoTember 1873, Not. 6-7. , . . . t -. i.,. . tinople, to whom the Political Agent m Turkish Arabia, had referred the case. Fahad bin Sintian also was shortly afterwards released and joined Abdul Aziz ; who had gone to Bahrein. Abdul Rahman-bin-Feysal, on arrival at Bahrein, learned that, dis gusted with the effete, cruel and rapacious rule of Bezech, the inhabitants of Hasa and the neighbouring districts were ripe for revolt, and only awaited a leader of the Saud family. Crossing to the mainland he was at once joined by bands of the Morah, Jijman, and other tribes, at the head of whom he marched on Hasa. The inhabitants welcomed him, and after a number of the Turkish gendarmes had been slain, the rest with Sheikh Bezech were besieged in the fort of Hofhuf. 159. Nasir Pasha, who had pledged himself to the success of the plan of Political a, m .;, No 127. app.mtir^ Bezeoh was called on by liedit lasha to quell the insurrection, and despatching 300 Arab horsemen by land proceeded himself by sea with a battalion of regular infantry to Hasa. Discord had broken out amongst the adherents of Abdul Rahman in Hasa owing to the jealousies of the leading Sheikhs of the Ejman, and on the approach of Nasir Pasha's force they dispersed, and Abdul Rahman joined Saud at Riadh. The fort of43 Hofhuf, in whioh Bezech with his garrison had been shut up, having thus political a, may 1875, No. 139. ^ eei } relieved, the town was by order of JNasir rasha given up to pillage, and for several days the Turkish soldiers and the Arab auxiliaries indulged in the indiscriminate massacre and plunder of the inhabitants ; men, women, and children were shot down, and women openly treated with the brutality peculiar to such occasions. It is said that the Turkish officers remonstrated with the Pasha on permitting and even ordering such severities, but Nasir Pasha replied that it was necessary to make an example to prevent revolt in future. Political a, mo, is?!, No. i «6. , 25 ' Nfsir Pasha left his son Mazyyad rasha with 800 regular infantry and one hundred cavalry to hold Hasa, and himself returned to Basrah.

In a later letter of the 24th April this news was confirmed, and it was further reported that Abdul Rahman bin Peysal and the sons of Saud were desirous of making peace with Abdullah bin Fey sal, the brother of the late Amir. The priesthood of Riadh, however, were averse to this on account of Abdullah's friendly relations with the Turks, and an armed force was said to have been sent against him from Riadh. 161.

He was a distant cousin of Abdullah bin Eeysal. (See genealogical table above para graph ). 175.

On his way down the Persian Gulf the Sheikh called on Colonel Ross at Bushire He represented that he was proceeding to Constantinople with the object above stated, and he added that he had understood from the Turkish authorities at Basrah that the Porte would be glad to arrive at an understand ing with the Saud family to relieve themselves of the expense of holding Hasa and Xatif. He believed that though the Turkish authorities did not consider it politic to initiate the proposal, mediation would be acceptable, and that the most appropriate mediator would be the British Ambassador at Cons tantinople. , 177. On arrival at Jeddah the Sheikh wrote to Colonel Ross explaining why he had left Basrah for Constantinople, and stating that he desired the British Ambassador to use his influence with the Porte. He pointed out the advantages to be gained by Turkey in making over Nejd, Hasa and Katif to the Saud family; and the advantages to England should he obtain what he wanted, and he concluded with a hint that if he was in want of funds to carry out his plans, the British Government might lend him what was needful. 178. In his despatch No. 31 of 23rd July 1880 the Secretary of State for- warded copy of correspondence regarding Secret, October 1880, No. 152. ^ desigDS of Sheikh Abdullah el Than- neyyan. On his way to Constantinople the Sheikh stayed for a time at Cairo, where he was lodged in one of the Khedive's palaces. Here he had two inter views with Mr. Malet, the British Consul, and explained his wishes. Mr. Malet referred to Her Majesty's Government for instructions as to how he should reply to the Sheikh. The London foreign Office consulted the India Office on the subject, and the reply of the latter was that it was doubtful46 whether it was desirable that Her Majesty's Government should interfere with the discretion of the Turkish Government in the matter. 179.

Of Abdullah bin Thanneyyan he says—• 'Altogether the Amir Abdulla, who called upon me, did not give me the impression that he was identified with any party in Aarid, but that he sought rather for personal motives to become, with or without the connivance of the Turkish authorities, ruler of El- Hasa; and ultimately, on the death of his uncle, the claimant by right of descent to the rule of Aarid, He spoke, perhaps naturally, in dis paraging terms of the power and position of Mahomed bin Rashid, tho present independent ruler and Amir of the Jelel Shammar, and the Flag E. (Northern Nejd) districts, formerly tributary to the Wababite monarchy. This bin Rashid is considered generally in this part of the country as all-powerful in Nejd, and is besides, according to some persons, perhaps the future leader of national aspirations in Central Arabia/' 181. The Vice-Consul further observed that Turkey possessed no influence or authority in Nejd or Central Arabia. With reference to the existence of any national movement in Arabia he wrote— As much has been said in the European press of late as to a national movement in Arabia, I may venture to state that no evidence of such is 'obtainable in this quarter; and that as regards the Bedouin tribes of the Syrian desert, which are supposed to be becoming gradually inoculated with similar ideas, the tribal wars and feuds, now as ever prevailing among them, and their complete subjection to the Turkish authorities whenever they approach the Syrian frontiers, would tend to show that the time is yet distant when unity of action or purpose can be obtainable among them.' 182. In October 1880 Government received a copy of a despatch from Secret!October 1880. No. 163. Mr ' in which he save a short account of the condition of Nejd, and the plans of the Saud dynasty. Before leaving Jeddah, Abdulla bin Thanneyyan had several interviews with the Consul, and gave him two documents, copies of which accompanied Mr. Zohrab's despatch. The first of these documents shows the line of succession in Nejd for tho last 450 years, the second is an account of the struggle between Saud and his brother, Abdullah, who was aided by the Turks. The latter is written for publication in the English newspapers. 183. Prom Abdullah bin Thanneyyan's account it would appear that after the death of Saud bin Feysal in 1874, his children being too young to govern were obliged to submit to their uncle, Abdullah bin Feysal, who virtually ruled in Nejd. Abdullah's adherents, the Wahabis, were opposed to the Saud faction, who desired the expulsion of the Turks from the coast line, the development of trade, free communication with other nations, and the moral support and protection of England. 184. Abdullah bin Thanneyyan explained to Mr. Zohrab that numbers of Nejdians had in recent years travelled to India and other foreign countries for trading purposes, which partly accounted for the liberal views of the Saud party, and in addition the dread of seeing the Turks push further into the country had raised a strong and influential party in favour of British protec tion. Once recognized by England as an independent people, this party thinks the Sultan could be induced to withdraw from the insignificant points held by his troops in Nejd; but if he declined to do this, they ^believe they could drive his troops out. They also hope that free intercourse with other countries would soon break that fanaticism for which the Nejdians have a not enviable reputation. 185. Mr. Zohrab adds— ' How far it may be of advantage to England to countenance the Lopes and wishes of Nejd is not in my piovinoe to disease; but 1 will venture to point out that as there appears to47 be a serious revival in the Mussulman world— a movement which may give much trouble if not properly met—there may be great benefit in our having a commanding voice in the country which, I may say, governs the actions of all Mussulmans, That country is Arabia, i.e., Yemen, Hedjaz, Tehema (the province in which, properly speaking, Jeddah and Mecca are situated), Nejd, See. 5 ' 186. Mr. Zohrab's views regarding a national movement against the rule of the Sultan in Arabia are exactly opposite to those, above quoted, of the Yice- Cousul, Damascus. He says— ' That the whole of Arabia is becoming hostile to the rule of the Sultan is no secret, and 1 do not believe there is a doubt that the revival of the Khalifat in the person of the Grand Shereef of Mecca is being seriously discussed and may soon be attempted.' XL —State of affairs in 1881. 187. Abdullah bin Eeysal was in Eiadh. Mahomed bin Saud was in Kharj and occasionally paid bis uncle a visit, as also did the elders of the Ajman tribe, Hazam and Rankan. The agent of the Pasha of Hasa had invited the Ajman chiefs to return to Hasa and promised that their allowances would be continued to them. They refused to go howover, and requested that the allowances might be paid to their agents in Kasa. XLI —Eise of the Shammar Principality, 1835—1882. Mere toe must pause a little and trace the rise of the Shammar principalityt which soon plays an important part m the history of Is'ejd. The following account in this chapter is taken from Mr. Blech's Memo randum. Enclosure to No. 365 in Secret E, August L904, Nos. 286-478. 188. At the earliest period of the history of Central Arabia, the numerous and powerful tribe of Tai from the Yemen occupied the Jebel Shammar. About 500 A. D. occurred the celebrated conflict between the tribes of Nejd, headed by Koleib Wail, Chief of Taghleb, and the armies of 'Yemen, led by the Lakhmite Chiefs ; the latter were overthrown, and the entire Nejd delivered from the Kahtanite yoke. In this war Tai, though of Yemenite origin, sided with the Nejdean clans of Rabia. Soon after these clans engaged in civil war, upon the treacherous murder of Koleib by bis kinsman Jessas. This caused many im portant changes in the relative position of the central tribes, and a large settle ment of Beni Taghleb, Beni Abs and Howazin took place within the limits of Jebel Shammar, where the new settlers united with the elder inhabitants, or Beni Tai, and from this union sprang the tribe of Sbammar still so called. 189. In the earlier years of Moslem rule we find this district still powerful and independent, resisting successfully all the efforts of the Ommiad Caliphs, whose armies were signally defeated at the entrance of these mountains during the reign of Merwan, towards the beginning of the eight century. Their subse quent history remains for a long time a blank. Some of the clan Shammar, notably the Bedr, were still Christians when they repulsed the Ommiad troops. Probably they eventually professed Islam. But they afterwards relapsed in to semi-barbarism, resumed pagan forms of worship, and split up into small factions. i 190 At the beginning of the eighteenth century the province underwent the short-lived tyranny of the first Wahabi Empire, and like other districts was but tensiently affected by it. At this time Hail was already looked upon as in a manner the capital of Jebel Shammar partly owing to its size and wealth, partly to its central position. Supreme rule was exercised in the family of Beit All, ancient denizens of the city. 191. But one Abdullah-bin-Rashid then lived in Hail. He was of the clan of laafer, the noblest branch of the Shammar tribe. Many of his re lations were Bedouins, though his own direct ancestors had long been towns- men. Wealthy high born and conscious of ability and vigour, he aspiredto wrest the hitherto undisputed pre-eminence from the chiefs of Beit Ali, and bis numerous and powerful relatives lent their aid to his endeavour. In Hail itself Abdullah's party soon became the stronger, but the neighbouring village of Kefar, then almost as strong and populous as Hail, held to J3eit Ali. 192. The struggle then began, and was unfavourable to Abdullah, who was driven into exile about 1818 or 1820. Accompanied by a band of his relatives, he took the road of the Jof, and, failing to find assistance, passed on the Wadi {Sirban. Here, however, the fugitives were attacked by a strong party of Aneyza Bedouins, the hereditary enemies of the Beni Shammar. After a desperate struggle all Abdullah's companions were slain, and he himself left for dead. Tradition ascribes his surviving to the miraculous aid of insects and birds, and to the assistance of a passing caravan, by whom Abdullah was taken on to Damascus, and tended until complete recovery. Returning then to Arabia, he received a ready welcome from Turki-ibn Saud, the Wahabi Amir, and became one of bis principal generals. Practically the leader of the expe dition sent in 1831 against Hasa under Feysal. it was he who Induced the Prince to march straight back upon Riadh as soon as the news of Turki 's murder and Mesharis usurpation reached the front. 193. It was, moreover, Abdullah who, on the twenty-first day of the siege of the palace of Riadh, in which Meshari was entrenched, slipped out by night with two trusty kinsmen of the Shammar, induced a friendly palace retainer to draw them up by rcpes through one of the windows, penetrated to Meshari's sleeping apartment, and killed the usurper after a protracted strug gle, in which Abdullah's two comrades lost their lives. In gratitude for these services, Peysal named him absolute Governor of Shammar Province—in Doughty's words, to be his constable of the western marches of Nejd—to govern Aneyza and its southern tribes, with right of succession, and supplied him with troops and all means for the establishment of his rule. 194. Abdullah then returned to Hail, and driving out the rival family of Beit Ali, became supreme ruler. His brother Obeid pursued the fugitives into Kasim, and there ravaged the country, and cut off the Beit Ali root and branch. 195. Meanwhile, Abdullah consolidated his power in the Jebel Shammar, beyond which, however, his sway did not extend. All his life-time he paid tribute to Feysal, and moreover, caused the Wahabi tenets to be recognised as the official faith of the State, in spite of the unpopularity of this measure, not apparently from religious conviction, but out of policy. He died in 1844 or 1845 while engaged in rebuilding Hail, and left three sons, Tilal, Mutaab, and Mahomed, besides his surviving brother, Obeid, Tilal's popularity insured his succession, and he seems to have been a pattern ruler. Besides continuing his father's improvements at Hail, he sent his uncle, Obeid, on an expedi tion against Kheibar, which was conquered, and fell under the Shammar rule. 196. Not long after, Kasim. weary of Wahabi tyranny, annexed itself to the Shammar kingdom. Tilal apologized to Feysal, who felt too weak to pro test against this aggrandizement of his powerful vassal at his expense, and was obliged to acquiesce. 197. Meanwhile, Tilal himself led a successful foray against Teima and the neighbourhood, and in 1855 conquered the Jof and destroyed the family of Beit Haboub, hitherto supreme there. Every-where he subjugated tne Bedouins. By a wise tolerance he induced Shiahs and other heretics to settle at Hail, and suffered much relaxation of the strict Wahabi doctrines, in spite of the protestations of Feysal, still nominally his overlord, and one whose daughter was married to him. He had also to preserve appearances with the Sultan, whose name looms large in the Friday prayers at Hail, but who derives no other benefit from the province. 198. Tilal still preserved the appearance of being a vassal of Ibn Saud, and repaired every year to Riadh with a present of horses. Returning in 1867 he fell sick, and sent eventually to Baghdad for a Persian doctor, who told the49 Amir that his understanding would become affected by his malady. &lt;c Mad! and I, the Amir 5 ,, ejaculated Tilal, and, as Doughty says, e&lt; because his high heart might not longer endure to live in the common pity, he set his pistols against his manly breast and fired them and ended.' 199. He was succeeded by his brother Mutaab, a mild mannered and intelligent man, who, however, after two years was assassinated by Tilal's two sons, Bandar and Bedr, at which the former succeeded him. 200. Meanwhile Mahomed, brother of Tilal and uncle of Bandar, fled to Eiadh. Here Abdullah-ibn-Saud brought about a reconciliation between him and Bandar, and Mahomed at the latter's invitation returned and became again Governor of the Baghdad Haj caravan. On one occasion when return ing to Hail he sent before him to greet the Amir Bandar. The latter, being displeased, refused him admittance to Hail and rode out with Bedr and Hamud to meet him, causing the town-gates to be shut behind them. A dispute arising Mahomed killed Bandar; then entering the town, he and Hamud ordered the slaughter of all the children of Tilal. 201. Mahomed thus began his long reign which lasted till his death in 1897. In his time the Ibn Rashid dynasty reached its heighest pitch of power. The homage to Ibn Saud was gradually disused in the decay of the Wahabi State, and in 3876 Ibn Rasbid was the greatest Prince in ^ejd. His was, according to Doughty, a ruler of factious Arabs by right to the sword : none of them, not persuaded by fear, would be his tributaries. The bloodshed attend ing his accession and the severity of his methods caused as much reprobation as terror among the Arabs, but all were obliged to admit that his rule was strong and successful. ' I think it would be hard to find a fault in Ibn Rashid's Government,' says Doughty in words which recall Palgrave's dithyrambic praise of Tilal. 102. Mahomed-ibn-Rashid, early in his reign, endeavoured to withstand a Turkish expedition against the Jof in 1872 : he was, however, defeated and glad to submit to terms, paying an annual tribute of 1,500 Mejids for the Jof, and admitting a Kaimakam and garrison to reside there. Doubtless this im pressed him with a great idea of Turkish power, for even when at the height of his glory, and while humbling the Ibn iSaud house to the dust in 1888, he posed as the officer or Lieutenant of the Ottoman Government. 103. To give figures is but misleading; however, Doughty, in a style more convincing of veracity than Palgrave, says that Mahomed Ibn Rashid might summon 2,000 fighting men from his villages and about 1,800 nomad Arabs; he is said to have 400 horses. His boundarieswere: on the north the Roualla, northern Shammar and Thuffir, friendly but not tributary tribes; on the east his limits were at the dominion of Boreydah, which includes a good many vil lages in the Nefud of Kasim; captured by Mahomed-ibn-Rashid in 1888, it has again passed into the hands of Ibn Saud ; in the south his limits are at about 100 miles from Medina; his western boundary is the Syrian Haj road.51 XLIII.—Hostilities between Abdullah-bin-Feysal and Ibn RasMd. 1882—18«6. 205. The death of Amir Peysal of Nejd was soon followed by internecine civil wars between his sons Abdullah and Sand. This afforded Mahomed Ibn Kashid opportunities to extend his power and consolidate his control over the tribes in Nejd adjoining his territory. The important tribe of Majma in Kasim placed itself under his protection. He gradually detached from the Nejdean principality the two rich districts of Boreydah and Sedeyyir. Though nominally vassal of the Wahabi Amir, Ibn Rashid was virtually independent of him, and made attempts to extend more and more his dominion in his lord's terri tory. 206. In the autumn of 1882, Abdullah«bin Peysal endeavoured to recover the district of Maj ma in Kasim. This attempt for P i e 8S2-83 Gulf Admilli9tratlon Re P ort brought the latter chieftain into the field, and Abdullah, outnumbered, retired to Riadh. There he learned that Ibn Hashid had entered into correspondence with his nephews, the sons of Saud, and had made overtures to them with a view to inducing them to take part against their uncle, or else to remain neutral. This, apparently, alarmed Abdullah, who, therefore, in March 1883, placed his relations with his nephews on a new footing, under which Abdullah-bin- Teysal was recognized as ' Imam,' or religious head of the Wahabis of Riadh, and the military power was entrusted to Mahomed-bin-Saud as Military Com- A Political e ., April ifiss, 178-74.

Hostilities then commenced between the Al-Saud and the chief of Jebel- Shammar. The chief tribes which rallied to the standard of Mahomed-bin- Saud were the Ateybah, the Kahtan, the Moteyr, the Sobeydah, theSuhul, the Dowasir, the Ajman, the Almorah, or rather fragments of those tribes. Mahomed Ibn Rashid commanded the Shammar, Harb, and Boreyah tribes. Their hostile operations did not go beyond raids and counter raids into one another's territories. Neither side appears to have gained any decisive successes. 207. Mahomed-bin-Saud was however soon alienated from his uncle Abdullah, he appears to have learned from intercepted letters that Abdullah was intriguing for his defeat and murder and thereupon threw up the com- External A..

He was reported to be friendly with the Sheikh of Koweit. 208. In April 1885 Ibn Rashid attacked two sub-tribes of the Ajman, who were encamped at the waters of Owaineh to the north of Hasa and plundered their houses and cattle. The Ajman tribe having subsequently received rein forcements, pursued Ibn Rashid and succeeded in re-capturing some of their horses and killing others. This incursion by Ibn Rashid was reported to bo due to the Ajman tribe having attacked some people under his protection. 209. In May 1886 a Turkish mission went to Hail to induce Mahomed Ibn Rashid to allow the erection of a mosque and a Government school at that _ . „ , 1CQ „ w ,0*1.1 place. Mahomed Ibn Rashid dismissed External A., November 1886, Nos. 137-141. r . . . i i j . the mission with presents but without acceding to their request. It was also reported that in the previous year (1885) valuable presents had been taken to Mahomed Ibn Rashid by the Turkish head of the mission, with a view to induce him to allow the erection of a mosque and school at Hayil. Mahomed Ibn Rashid reported to be in command in 1886 of a force of 2,000 horse-men, 15,000 foot and camel men, and had four field pieces, also 1,000 breech-loading rifles.52 XLIV.—Imprisonment of Abdnllah-bin-Feysal and absorption of the WahabiiKingdom in the Shammar Principality, 1887—1896. 210. la the autumn of 1887 intelligence'was received that the sons of bxtemai a,, Pebruary is87, Nos, 169-182.

Were put tO death in Kliari by Ibn 1S;Nol:Ssl; SabhaD . a* Agent of Eashid.. Accounts vary as to the reason for this massacre, but it seems probable that their uncle Abdullah-bin-Eeysal instigated the murder of these princes. The eldest, Mahomed-bin-Saud, was much beloved in Nejd on account of his chivalrous and liberal disposition. Eor months the Bedouin Arabs refused to credit the news of his death, and rumours wereevery- Extemai a., January 1889, Nos. 74-75. where prevalent that Mahomed had escaped, and was living amongst Bedouins m the desert. Only one son of Saud survived, Abdul Aziz, and he resided at Hail, as also did his uncle, Abdullah-bin-Feysal, now styled the ' Imam ' in .Nejd. The power of Mahomed-ibn-Bashid was then paramount through out Nejd from the conlines of Syria to Hasa. In the time of the Amir of Nejd Feysal-bin-Turki as noted above Abdullah-bin-Bashid, father of the present Amir of Shammar, was appointed ' Mahafidh/' or warden of the frontier, by the Wahabi Chief, and, latter, Mahomed-ibn-Bashid was befriend ed by Abdullah-bin-Peysal, and owed to the latter his accession to power in Hayil. Now, owing chiefly to family dissensions, the Wahabi princes had lost their authority, and the relative positions had completely changed. 214.

Prom the British ambassador—Sir W. White's letter, dated 9th May 1889, it appears that Ibn Rashid was anxious to secure from the Sultan jurisdiction oyer Hasa, while the Sultan was desirous of securing a greater hold over Nejd and Shammar. Both these purposes could not be attained having regard to the facts that the Porte's policy was to extend its jurisdiction over the Arab littoral, and the ambition of Ibn Bashid to be practically independent ruler, only nominally acknowledging the suzerainty of the Sultan.53 21 fi In the vear 1890 a more serious attempt than usual was made by Abdul Rahman-bin-reysal to shake the external a., october 1890, noa. 120-25. power of Ibn-Hashidi and having marched external a, november 1890, nos. 4u-49. a gainst 'Riadh he captured and imprisoned Ibn Sabhan, Agent of Ibn Bashid.

Biadh was soon besieged by Ibn-Bashid and bombarded, but with no distinct effect ; eventually peace was concluded between him and Bahman. By its terms Biadh remained in the hands of the Al-Saud, who ceded to Ibn-Bashid, Washam and Sedeyyir, with their dependencies.

An interview, which Sheikh Jasim had requested, was declined by Mahomed Ibn Bashid for fear of giving offence to the Turkish Government. About the middle of the year 1895 disorders and insecurity on the trade routes were caused by the predatory raids Persian Gulf Administration Report for 1895-96. ^ ^ ajman, morahand other tribes under the nominal suzerainty of the Turks. In June the caravan traffic between Keid and Koweit was thus interrupted, and in October Mahomed Ibn Bashid appealed to the Governor of Hasa to guarantee the safety of the roads to Nejd and Kasim, failing which he claimed discretion himself to chastise the tribes named, as disturbers of the peace of his territory. XLV.—Complications with Koweit ISO'T—1904. 221. There is nothing in the records of the affairs of Nejd in 1896. In 1897 there arose complications with Koweit, which still continue to occupy the Arab tribes in internecine wars and have attracted a good deal of attention from the Turkish Government on the one hand, with German Kaiser probably behind the scenes, and from the British Government on the other. A detailed narrative of these interesting events is given in the Precis of Koweit Aj/aire, A brief summary of the facts will suffice here.54 222. At end of 1897 Abdul Aziz, nephew of Mahomed-ibn-Kasliid, succeed ed to the Chiefship. It was reported that Pert'mn Qulf Beiidency Adminiitration Report for the SOUS of the late IvGW ( J it fellGlkh who 1898-99. . had been murdered by his brother Mubarak l899, had enlisted the Jabal Shammer Sheikh on their side ; a descent on Koweitwas contemplated in order to oust Sheikh Mubarak, but never actually carried out. 223.

Abdul Rahman-bin-reysal then marched to Nejd and asked for help from Mubarak of Koweit. Meanwhile Abdul Aziz-ibn-Rashid, Amir of Nejd, and the nephews of Mubarak of Koweit were together plotting against Sheikh Mubarak. The Amir tried to get the Turks to countenance his action asrainst Mubarak. It was reported Secret E., February 1901, Ncs. 22-107. , r? i, -i , ,1 • 3 that a fight between the parties was im minent. Abdul Rahman-bin-Feysal (with Mubarak's connivance) raided the Amir's territory, to weaken his authority. The Amir with a large force threat ened Koweit and demanded satisfaction. The crisis subsided as the Amir re quested the Turks to redress his grievances, thus professing himself a vassal of the Sultan. The whole of this part of Arabia was in a turmoil owing to the quarrel between Koweit and Nejd, the Amir Abdul Aziz-bin-Rashid having On his side the nephews of Mubarak, the Sheikh of Koweit, and the tebel Yusuf- bin-Ibrahim.

More preparations on both sides went on for a campaign. 224. In [February Mubarak was reported at a place one day's march from Nejd with 70,000 men. Ibn-Rashid's whereabouts were unknown, but he asked Jasim of Katr to help him. Abdul Aziz-bin-Peysal, son of Abdul Rahman, was appointed Governor of Riadh, which place had been occupied by Mubarak's forces; the whole of Nejd submitted without fighting to Mubarak. In Eebruary Abdul Aziz-ibn-Rashid was three days from Hayil, helpless and fleeing from Mubarak. A severe fight took place on the 17th March near Hayil in which Mubarak was defeated and dispersed. Amir-Ibn-Rashid was not likely to attack Koweit without the Sultan's leave ; who seemed to be backing him quietly Proceedings Secret K, June 19^1, Nos. 118-230. and probably wished to profit by the Proceedings Secret E., October 1901, Nos. 184-315. quarrel to OCCUpy Koweit. In May both parties asked for British protection, but the Nejd Amir required deposi tion of the Koweit Sheikh Mubarak, against whom he had grievances. In August the Turks continued retaining the Amir of Nejd from reprisals on Koweit. 225. The Turks encouraged the Nejd Amir to force measures against 1902 Mubarak of Koweit secretly.

The Amir retaliated by raids. All southern Nejd acknowledged Abdul Aziz-bin- Abdul Rahman-bin-Peysal, and he was probably stronger than the Amir at this time.

Abdul Eahman-bin Peysal also settled at Riadh with his son Abdul Aziz. Two skirmishes took place in March, in both of which the Amir was defeated and cattle, etc , captured from him. Abdul Aziz whilst on a visit at Koweit, visited theUussian ship Boyarin and was offered money and rifles to help against Nejd by the Russian Consul. The Sheikh of Koweit, Mubarak, was again warned not to interfere in Nejd, but he has all along tried to help his friends the bin-reysal in their aspirations. 229. The Nejd Amir was himself weak owing to dejections to his rivals the bin^Feysal family, who had the whole of position m 1903. Southern Nejd entirely under their sway and other parts partially so. The Amir Ibn-Ilashid, however, has had the almost open support of the Porte. On the other hand the bin-Feysal family the the support of the Koweit Sheikh, but this support was accorded them in spite of all representations from the British Government to the Sheikh Mubarak of KoWeit, not to mix himself up in Nejd affairs. It was natural that he should support the bin-Eeysal, as his worst enemies, viz.) Yusuf-bin-Ibrahim and his nephews are arranged on Ibn-Rashid's side. 230. In the beginning of the year 1904, the bin-Feysal conquered a portion of northern Nejd and their power was on Position in March 1904. ^ ascendaritj The Amir Ibn-Eashid applied to the Turks for protection, and in March there were reports of a large assistance in men, arms and money having been despatched by the Turkish Government to him from Baghdad. bih October 1904.
