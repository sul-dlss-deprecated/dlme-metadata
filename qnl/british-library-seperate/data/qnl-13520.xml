In particular, this image is intended to illustrate the habits of dress as described by Frederick Mercer Hunter in the preceding pages (pp. 43-44). Hunter describes these as follows:‘The Arabs of Aden have adopted the dress of the people inhabiting the Lahej district. This consists, in the male sex,
                           Firstly, of a turban (doosmal) of Surat manufacture […]
                           Secondly.—A loose jacket (shaiah), reaching to the hips, made of white or dyed cotton […]
                           Thirdly.—A sort of kilt (maawiz) made of cotton, with a white coloured border […]
                           Fourthly.—Over the left shoulder is hung a sort of scarf (radîf), made of cotton […]
                           Fifthly.—Sandals (madâs) [...].’The man in this image is leaning on a stick in his left hand and appears to have markings, perhaps tattoos, on his calves: one immediately above his right ankle, one below his left knee.Inscriptions:In pencil, upper right corner adjacent to print: ‘6’</abstract><typeOfResource>still image</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Photograph</genre><name type="personal"><namePart>Frederick Mercer Hunter</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Aden</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Ethnographic heritage</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023400730.0x00000a#share">Public Domain</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
