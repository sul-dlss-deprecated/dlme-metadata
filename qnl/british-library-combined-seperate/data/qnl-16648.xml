                           Tigris,at Bassadore [Bāsa’īdū], and states that the duties required by Blane as stated in an earlier letter of 30 January 1833 have been performed. Pepper relates the details of his trip to Shargar [Sharjah] to obtain redress from the Shaik, Sultan bin Sugger [Sulṭān bin Saqr Āl Qāsimī], for damage to property. Owing to the Shaik's inability to meet Pepper's demands with a monetary payment, he describes how a series of negotiatons were followed by threats and then direct action, before payment was received in the form of boats and property. Pepper concludes the letter by proposing that his perseverance in this matter will have the beneficial effect of putting down future piracy on British property.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023673727.0x000004#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
