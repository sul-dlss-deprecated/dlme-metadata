In this connection,, it may be observed that the United i ati.s Goieinnient have already protested against the proposal to try an American citi/.eii m a J ales tine court as at present constituted. It is doubtful how far the pm ilegc of being tried by a British judge will appeal to an American or a I unehman. I resumably the League of Nations will comment on this point. ,1 , ,V' ^ ,U ' Ulah thnn Palestine .—I think it is important to remember inat the Ifntish wid, as it appears, he in much stronger force in Palestine than in Mesopotamia, and suggest that Mr. Malkin’s criticism scarcely meets the ease as it mil probably be, ,.e„ the case of an Arab country with very little of the British element m it. Ii capitulations mean safeguards for .civilised foreigners in a semi- eivmsed country where the systems of law are defective and the judges biassed and (on iipt, something like capitulations would be superior to any other scheme, but of • t.Jie -Egyptian, not of the Ottoman type. See para. 8 of the Memorandum. But in Egypt Jie Jaws are much more in accordance with European ideas. And in any case the terms or the inanciate make capitulations impossible. U). Jurisdiction over Foreigners in Palestine.—Mtewtion is drawn to Sir H. feamuel s despakdi, paras. 5-10, in connection with jurisdiction over foreigners. lie piopo^ea that tli(‘ system at present in force for cnmmal cases be continued, i.e., for any ottence more serious than a contravention a foi-eign resident may claim to be tried by a single British magistrate or by a court containing a majority of British judges, n regard to civil suits, he suggests that where a foreign subject is a party the case s iou i be tried by a British judge sitting alone, if the foreign party so desires, and should be judged on appeal by a court containing a majority of British judges. (Vide 1&lt;&gt;- Doniicilmrij Search and Arrest of Foreigners.—Para. 15 of Sir E. Bonham- . artei s Memoiandum raises an important point, that of i/oj/uc^mr?/searc/i of a foreign subjeift s house by local authorities. Sir E. Bonham Carter proposes that it would * oe sufficient if in the chief towns their houses were exempted from search except on a wan ant issued by a British judge of the court having jurisdiction in mixed cases. VVhere there is no such judge, search should be permitted on the warrant of a local judge, ou H. Samuel agrees with this proposal, but apparently' only because the Governor and Deputy District Governor can exercise magisterial powers, including the issue ol a warrant oi search or arrest. These conditions will not apply to Mesopotamia unless the British Adviser-Inspectors are given magisterial powers. If they are not given these powers, it would, in my r opinion, be inadvisable to allow domiciliary In ^ Haghdmk hovve\er, the Coui't of Appeal consists of one British judgr ami two Arab .judges. I he British judge is president. No civil court has a majority of British judges.4 search of foreigners, including British subjects, by local Arab magistrates and police. As Mr. Malkin hints, the question of the kind of police who carry out the warrant is of first-class importance. No one who knew them would attribute honesty, gentleness and a sense of orderly discipline to Arab policemen. As for Arab magistrates under an Arab Government, the power of issuing warrants for search of houses gives them a very tempting instrument of annoyance to foreigners in places where there is none but Arab protection. It is clear that this question of domiciliary search can only rightly be considered when it is known how far we hand the administration in all branches to the Arabs. , 17. Persians .—The case of the Persians in Mesopotamia is one of great difficulty. I have had experience of it in ‘Amarah, which contains many Persians, including a number who are Persian or Ottoman subjects as its suits them. Their consuls, so far as my experience goes, are hopeless people. If possible, Persians should be considered apart from European foreign subjects, as they were considered in Turkish times. The treaty between Turkey and Persia is given as an appendix to Sir E. Bonham-Carter s Memorandum and differs from the capitulations. The case of Persians might perhaps be left to special arrangements between the Arab Government and Persia. P.
