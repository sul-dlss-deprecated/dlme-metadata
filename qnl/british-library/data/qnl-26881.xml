The schools reopened on May 10th. I new Assistant Hutasarrif. AflM&amp;D YA&gt;IN AL AMIB f has arrived to take the place of KAQI J VML. Both men are considered friendly to Britain. Colonel A.I.

Prom fist to B5th ^ay there was a strike involving some 400 Port orker- employed either in the Port Marine dockyard or the Juhaila l; )nginee]ping workshops. The workers demonstrated outside the rutasarrifiya and were received by the Putasarrif before returning to work. “Bieir principal renuest was for an B houn day. 5.

It is now edited by Iss el Pin al Pais, a relative by marriage of the Maquib family, and shows no signs of its previous anti- British Mas. *Al Was* was enmended for some days with effect from 8th ay, pending the hearing of a charge against it for inciting stulent'-’ to strike. 4.

Mm nrice*? have also increased following the reluctance of dealers to sell owing to the nrosnect of a poor rice crop in the Amara district this year. Tea has been imported in large Quantities from Ceylon with the result that the market is now overstocked with inferior qualities and prices have fallen; there is still a demand for good quality tea. 'Tiere has been no distribution of piece goods for some time, but cotton piece goods are available at reasonable prices in the black market. Prices of stlfc goods have advanced owing to decreased imports and high prices in the countries of origin. Building materials have been in good demand, especially iron ioists and cement. Holders of iron loists, however, are reluctant to sell as only small quantities have been offered from England, Belguim, etc. Owing to the monsoon, no dhows are leaving for India and gold smuggling has consequently ceased for the present. The cost of living in Basra, in general, was slightly higher than in April. n rices of certain commodities in the local market are given in an appendix to this report. 6.

The 15 successful candidates, of whom 7 ore re^nraea as Government nominees, include 5 bias, 5 unnis, 2 Jews and one Christian. All are politically respectable with the possible exception of ABDUL nX.PI AL BiuiAHI, a naturalised Persian, who had an unsavoury reputation as a lawyer at DI* ANIY3H and was a sinnorter of dA^HID ALI. One other deputy, JAFAR \LkUiJM. AL UDR, nldo a naturalised ersian, was arrested in August 1944 for alleged 'oorrmnist 0 activities. As, however, his family are rich stockbrokers, his ’’comnunism' need not be taken very seriously. . . , „ The Government was accused of interfering in the elections, possibly not without some Justification. Tn B*sra Liwa the Ihitasarrif let it be^plearly knom who the Government candidates were hut this/not prevent three members of the National Denote tic T.rty from fitting elected, apparently for religious rather than political reasons: the hia majority were unwilling to accept the Government s 3unni nominees en bloc. The Jewish coo unity in Basra were also annoyed by the imposition of a Jew from ^agd^td instead of their local leader, 13008 \3ID. In the * unt*flq only one candidate who was not on the official list was,''^rllowed to stand, and he was defeated. In. Uaara the Government s attempt to impose a Bagdadi deputy who had no connection whatever with the constituency aroused considerable opposition and at one moment serious trouble threatened but at the last minute the local candidate stood down rather than risk bloodshed. „ ^ After the election the National democratic Party KjzaA, ' called upon ^ our successful candidates to boycott the V Chamber of deputies but the three from Basra would not answer the ^arty call; they resigned from the Party nstead. The tribal situation has been quiet except for one small clash between Hanadlya and Karamesha sections of the Beriha (Mojtfbin) tribe near V&amp;jldlyft (Harttia -Mhelya) in whch four tribesmen were killed and eight wounded. 'me policeman was also wounded. 2. LABOUR The Basra Port Union showed some signs of activity, * conditions of labour in the Port being severely criticised at one meeting. . , . * . ««, IBie British \rmy f s decision to grant Iraqi civilian workers their leave and other rights under the Ir^q Labour Law caused some satisfaction. British firms in Basra maintained their interest in labour conditions, and the Insra Petroleum Company introduced a provident scheme for all their monthly employees.EXT v®) II 5.

Pi^'n; -im X The Indian ^rade Delegation to the ^iddle l^ast, consisting of 8 nembers under the leadership of 1 r. : . uH. IFAHAII, arrived at Basra by air on larch llth. During their stay of 54 hours, the Delegates called on the principal Irani authorities, the British Chanber of Commerce^and Indian merchants and «ere entertained to tea by the ^asra Chamber of * e and Indian merchants. Luncheon parties in honour of the Delegation were given by RAJI MUP&gt;TAFA TAHA &gt;ALMAl on lith and by 'JID H PJ.D- ,L» i IB on IPth March, ' \YID PDULM- AL-JATrAR also gave a dinner for them on Mansh llth. T lusiness discussions T^hich the Delegation had in Bnsra were all informal but it is understood that the date monopoly and the high Indian import duty on dates were subjects of conversation. The telegation left for Angdad by train on 19th March# orking: Committee of the Inter- si an delations Conference at Pew Delhi, arrived in Basra from Tehran on 18th March with the intention of meeting the yrian, Lebanese, ^Dissi^n and ongolian delegates and accompanying them to Delhi.
