Mo.C/ElS. 6th April 1938. I have been concerned for some time at the lack of financial control over the Residency Agent* Sharjah by the Political Agent, Bahrain* I never see his T*A* bills or know anything about his office expenditure, and X think it is necessary that * should. On the other side of the picture is the fact that at times the Residency Agent has to wait ages for his pay from Bushire - he had only just got his January pay when I saw him on March 25th, Unless there are any insuperable objections I intend to suggest to Sir Trenchard Fowle on his return that financial control should pass to the Bahrain Office* It is true there is some differnce between Bahrain and Sharjah in final account ing, but I cannot see that this is a real difficulty. I should however be glad to have your views and those of the Treasury Officer, Bushire before going further. Captain A.C. Galloway Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Oulf, Bushire. r rA 4/214 dated the Mp ril, 1938 «}'■ I am 'writing in reply to your demi-official letter No* C/213, dated the 6th April, 1938, regarding the proposed transfer of financial control over the Residency Agent, Sharjah, to the Political Agent, Bahrain. like to explain the position in regard to remittances made by this office to the Residency Agent. In addition to the pay and allowances of the Residency Agent and his establish ment, this office has to deal with a number of miscellaneous claims submitted by the Residency Agent from time to time on account of Travelling Allowance, Post and Telegram charges, maintenance of slaves, launch hire etc. and recei pts from sale of Court Fee stamps. The process of transla tion and examination of these intimations of receipts and expenditure necessarily involves a certain amount of delay before the sums can be drawn from the Treasury, and it has been the practice to send regular monthly lump remittances to the Residency Agent on account of his pay and that of his establishment for the preceding month and in settlement of various other claims. I attach a statement showing details of such remittances during the last six months, from which you will see that the Residency Agent has little ground for complaint. 3. From the accounts point of view, neither Mr. Tanner 2 Before dealing with the proposal itself, I should nor/ The Hon* ble Mr. H. Weightman, ICS., Bahrain.nor I anticipate any difficulty in giving effect to your suggestion. You know Sharjah expenditure, unlike that of Bahrain, is divisible in moieties between His Majesty^ Government and the Government of India, and is, therefore, adjustable against the grants of the Bushire Residency. If Sharjah payments are to be disbursed at Bahrain, the debits should be adjusted against the appropriate grants of the Bushire Residency, through the Accountant-General, Central Revenues. At the same time intimations of such debits should be sent to this office as they occur for the purpose of ulti mate financial control, and provision of funds. Any extra ordinary item of expenditure would, of course, require the prior sanction of the Political Resident. 4. To regularise a change all that would be required would be an order by the Political Resident appointing the Political Agent, Bahrain, 'Head of Office' and 'Controlling Officer' for the purpose of the Residency Agent* s pay and travelling allowance bills etc.Statement showing details of remittances made to the Residency Agent* Sharjah, during the six months from September, 1937, to February, 1938.

When you were here last I mentioned to you a proposal that financial control over the Residency Agent, Sharjah, might be exercised by the Political Agent, Bahrain. You were sympathetic to this suggestion, and said that you wir^fhave ,y* 7 * ; no objection to the issue of orders accordingly provided your Treasury Officer assured you that there were no snags. 2. Unless you see any objection on fhrther consideration, could orders be issued transferring control here, on the understanding that no extraordinary expenditure should be incurred without your prior sanction?
