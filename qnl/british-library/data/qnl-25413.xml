Shaikh Mubarak informed me that he had recent ly received a letter from the (Trucial) Shaikh of Ajman, en closing a letter to Bin Saud which he has asked Shaikh Mubarak to send on if he thought desirable. The latter continued that the letter was an indiscreet production in which Shaikh Humaid bin Abdul Aziz had expressed his readiness to serve Bin Saud (or words to that effect) and that he (Shaikh Mubarak) had replied that he had not sent the letter on and that Shaikh Humaid had better mind his own business and not indulge in intrigue of this nature which would only get him into serious trouble. i 2. I informed Shaikh Mubarak that I was very much obliged for the attitude adopted by him and for his good advice to the Shaikh of Ajman, and hoped toi he would not fail to repeat it if occasion arose. Though I report it to Government, I do not think the incident is serious enough to make it advisable for me to take it up with the Shaikh of Ajman and bring in the Shaikh of Kuwait's name, but I am directing the Residency Agent to repeat the general v/arning already given to the Trucial , Shaikhs and to maintain vigilance in order to preclude any ignorant member of the category from being led into stupid2 ^ ^ 6'77 In any further communication on this subject, please quote no. 50236/L3.

I am to state, in reply, that Sir E.

The bond tides of the Basrah authorities in this correction cannot he relied on, and if men are still there when meeting with Bin Saud takes place both he and Sheikh of Qatr will find it difficult to take seriously the intimation I made to latter in this connection.” We agree with Cox as 1 to desirability of securing, if possible, early removal of Turkish garrison from Katr.' ip / No. 2796 Of 1913.

Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Consul Crow to Mr. Marling. (No. 37.) Sir, Basra, June 14, 1913. I HAVE the honour to enclose copies of two telegrams which have been forwarded to me by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, giving information received from Bahrein regarding the occupation of El Hassa by Bin Sand. With reference to my despatch No. 36 of the 11th instant, according to information received here, twelve guns of various kinds and four large siege guns were captured by Bin Sand at Hassa, wdio has detained thirty artillerymen and ten gendarmes for service there, and paid them their wages. Nowras Effendi, an officer who took the Turkish soldiers to Bahrein, is stated to have brought 200 men and two guns from the El Katr peninsula, and to have embarked them, together with 497 Turkish soldiers from Bahrein on sailing vessels, in which the force landed at Ojeir. One day later Bin Saud is reported to have advanced on them with about 3,000 Arabs, and the Turks fled, leaving six men killed on the field. Bin Saud thereupon captured fifty Turkish soldiers and an officer, who failed to escape from Ojeir, but released them again later after depriving them of their arms and ammunition and exacting from them, an oath never to return to fight against him. It is said the 200 men and two guns were returned to El Katr, and Nowras Effendi remains at Bahrein. I have, &amp;c. F. E. CROW. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 919, I have received the following additional information, dated the 26th May, from Bahrein : [2985 p —6] 5 Sti’iui Copy to India 5 SEP 1913 l/\ ? 1. It is alleged that Bin Saud has wwitten to the Ottoman authorities in Basra, saying that the action which was taken was forced on him by the^ complaints of me inhabitants that they were being oppressed by the Turkish subordinate officials. He added that he would willing represent the Turks as Vali, and that he would undeitake responsibility for the tranquillity of the district. . 2. Contrary to expectation, the steamer ££ John O’Scott did not sail from Bahrein, but made various excuses for lingering on there. Three officers, thirty ^ men an J L vo small guns arrived from A1 Bida on the 25th instant, and on the following day Major Nuris Bey, with about 500 men and two guns set out for Ojeir and Katif in native boats, giving out that it was proposed to come to an understanding with Bin Baud. The “John O’Scott ” is still hanging on at Bahrein under one excuse or anothei, and a Turkish Colonel, who has arrived from Basra, has her at his disposal. 3. I have received a report from Fao to-day to the effect that, pending the ex pectec rnrvr&gt;r' rt-i Z V I _2 - .III I in lira II— arrival of the “ Hamidieh ” from Aden and the “ Marmaris ” from Bombay, orders have been issued to the Turkish force at Bahrein to eke out the time. It is reported that the Turkish consul at Bushire telegraphed to his Minister yesterday, saying that Katif had been retaken by the Turkish troops, but I find it difficult to accept this statement as correct. A compromise, however, may possibly have been arrived at. y Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Cox to Government of India. ^ 1 (Telegraphic.) ^Bushire, % June5, 1913. WITH reference to my telegram of the 30th May, I have received a report from the Political Agent, Bahrein, dated the 1st June, in which he stndes^that the force under the Turkish major proceeded not to Ivatif but to Ojeir, wher^Bfe major landed 110 men and effected the capture of a small tower, losing ten men in casu^hies in the course of the operation. Sixty men were then left in the fort, and the dk^Kwith the rest, made their way back to the boats to fetch some guns. On arriva^^Kjhe boats, however, the men declined to go back, and the major was obliged t^j^^Hbark and abandon the sixty men in the fort. The latter subsequently surrendered^^^in Saud, who sent them over to Bahrein, having first relieved them of their ^ arms. As already reported, the whole force then embarked on the “ John 0 Scott and proceeded to Basra. It is pointed out by the Political Agent that the use made of Bahrein by the troops as a base for operations, and their presence there have been a source of annoyance and embarrassment to Sheikh Esa, and is calculated to bring him into the dispute. The Political Agent suggests that we should now consider the advisability of lodging a protest, and urges that we should in any case warn the Turkish Government that if any further operations are contemplated by them they are not to make use of Bahrein, but to carry them out between Basra and some point on the mainland. This latter intimation will, I trust, be conveyed to them at all events.From Viceroy, 5th September 1913. Foreign Secret. My telegram of 28th August last. Following for (? group omitted). Cox has received letter from Bin Saud in reply to his of 9th July—copy forwarded with Foreign Secretary’s weekly letter 32 M. Reply is very friendly in tone, it adumbrates widespread inconvenience which must necessarily result from a state of war and apparently seeks a clearer explanation of our attitude. It offers a convenient opening for contemplated communication. I have authorised Cox to reply as follows : - “ 1 have duly received your esteemed letter and understand from it that you seek a fuller explanation of attitude of British Government in regard to your affairs and interests. It is somewhat difficult to give such explanations without knowing more precisely on what points it is that you desire fuller knowledge, or in what directions you would expect British Government to evince its friendly regard. If you desire it I should be happy to have a meeting with you and a friendly interchange X)f views in this connection. “ Meanwhile I have my Government’s authority to assure you that, provided you undertake on your part to abstain from all action calculated to disturb the status quo, or to create unrest amongst Arab principalities whose rulers are in relations with His Majesty’s Government, including principality of Qatr, independence of which under the government of the late Sheikh Jasim and his successors of the Bin Thani has been recently recognised by British and Turkish Governments, the British Government will continue to maintain friendly relations which have been sustained in the past.” --(Copy).

I am further to invite your attention to paragraph 224 in the Persian Gulf Diary for the month of March 1913, in which it is reported that Captain ShaMespear was at Majma'a • a town which is apparently nearly 150 miles3? was in the neighbourhood. His Majesty*s Secretary of State for India is of the opinion that Captain Shakespear was ill-advised in proceeding to so great a distance beyond the linits claimed by the Shaikh of Kuwait, and I am to say that it should be clearly understood in future that the tours of the Political Agent must, unless otherwise directed by the Government of India, be confined strictly to the limits eventually assigned to Kuwait under the Anglo-Turkish Convention, I have etc,, Sd/- L.W,Reynolds, Deputy Secretary to the Government of India,From Viceroy, 28th August 1913. Foreign Secret Bin Sand. Cox was instructed in accordance with your telegram of 21st August, and was asked to telegraph for approval terms of communication to Amir. He has now sent following telegram :— “ Before we enter into communication with Ibn Saud it would be very convenient, and might affect wording of communication, if we had some idea as to lines on which Turkish Government would be disposed to entertain 'pGff desiredyj- to reconciliation with Ibn Sand in case latter solicited or welcomed our good offices. Would it be possible to sound Hakki Pasha on this point informally ? ” We do not think it is desirable to delay making proposed communication for this information but consider that it might be well to sound Hakki Pasha as suggested when opportunity offers in order that we may know on what lines to proceed hereafter should P&gt;in Saud solicit our mediation. We are therefore instructing Cox to proceed with preparation of draft communication without delay.From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, p 3rd July 1913. (Repeated to Bushire.) Foreign Secret. Cox’s telegram dated 27th June, and your telegram of 1st July. Bin Sand should he informed that no assistance has been given to Turkish troops, and that His Majesty’s Government appreciate his friendly sentiments, but they cannot intervene in any way in the dispute, and must maintain the strictest neutrality between the two parties. [Message ends.] His Majesty’s Government do not overlook importance of Bin Saud, but they desire above all things that nothing should be said or done at present juncture to arouse suspicion either in Turkey or elsewhere that they desire or will encourage disintegration of Turkish power in Asia, and all language and thought suggestive of spheres of influence and the like should be carefully avoided.Enclosure f - ’•♦ter from F No. 3 ' ' '''■etsry, India. 7 AUG iaib s''') l CO^FpENTIAL. ) 1 k l Hf* IfnwTw.^'' -• 1 1 1 COPY TO ' rr: 26 AUG 1913 No. 2249, dated Bushire, the 2oth (received 28th) July 1913.

After enquiries after your esteemed health. We beg to address your Honour in consideration of the previous friendship between us and you and of the still earlier treaty belonging to the time of my grand father Faysal—may God forgive him—of the period of which fifty-five years have e’apsed and fifty-five years still remain to run. I desire tojestablish the same in the same manner as it existed between you and my ancestors and this (fact) has prompted me to make this reference. Firstly, I am confident that there will happen nothing to your people to produce causes which may be contrary to friendship and rules. And we have now-a days conquered the country of our fathers and grand fathers {viz), El Hasa and El Qatif, as well as their dependencies and spared the soldiers remaining there, sending them over to Bahrain because it was more convenient for them to make their way to Basrah from that place. When they reached Bahrain, however, they were assisted by some one from your side and he afforded them the necessary facilities and encouraged them to stay at Bahrain and to cause trouble in our side. We received the news of this but we did not believe it because your wisdom and justice would not agree to this. After a few days they set out from Bahrain for El Qatif, but they returned in disappointment and remained for several days, having no supporter but your subjects and dependents. A few days afterwards they pro ceeded towards El Ojair and on their arrival there they experienced such a disas ter at the hands of a small party of our dependents as had not crossed their minds and they returned disappointed and repentant. Praise and thanks be to God that we do not attach the least importance or significance to them—or rather to them and to the party to w T hom they are connected. Yes, we, the Islamic and Mohammedan Arabs, will rise to uphold our honour and will recover our rights with the last drop of our blood and we are doing this with confidence in the One Single God and also in all our Moslem brethren. We all have joined hands and there is no difference between us, wtj having been joined together by the cause of Islam and by the Arab sense of honour, in view of my friendly * feelings I desire to be on the same terms with you as existed between you and my ancestors and (I desire that those terms) should exist between me and you j after them, (my ancestors). If the relations are as before and if it is incumbent upon both the parties to ^ protect the subjects, we bind ourselves to you in regard to those who are in our side and to what concerns your subjects, and we will respect their honour, protect them and be responsible for them—because there remain certain people in our side who are against you and your subjects, and we ask for similar treatment from you. If this be really the case in view of the past friendship and of laws, please give us an intimation accordingly, and if the conditions are changed and the situation is not as we expect, then please warn us, so that we may be cognisant of the same. And thanks be to God, the Lord of both the Worlds and may his peace be on our Lord, Mohammed, his posterity and companions. Greetings. (Translation.)

Unless we come to some mutual and amicable understanding with the Amir who has hitherto been friendly disposed to us the probability is that we shall force him to adopt an attitude of permanent hostility which cannot but react unfavourably on the Chiefs of the littoral VV e therefore strongly advocate not any definite treaty with the Amir but a friendly interchange of views in which we should intimate to him that we expect nim not to interfere with the territories of Chiefs with whom we have treaty oh other relations in the Gruff littoral. We see no reasorl why if this were done with the full knowledge of the Porte to whom our intentions could be clearly explained there should be any risk of offending Turkish susceptibilities or raising their suspicions. We might warn Trucial Chiefs seriously against any provocative action against the Amir, but instead of assuring them of immunity from him which is only likely to encourage them to assume a truculent attitude towards him we might tell them that our relations with Amir are such that their fears of aggression on his part are groundless. \\ e are repeating to you a telegram which has just been received from Cox in which he advocates a similar line of policy. * From Viceroy, llth August 1913.

I note that Secretary of State’s telegram of 3rd July takes a more benevolent line, the pertinence of which I fully appreciate ; but I submit that the letter above quoted hardly takes adequate cognisance of fact that at any rate for a long time to come the Porte can exercise no control whatever over Bin Sand, and that meanwhile he is in a position to give a varying deal of inconvenience alike in regard to Oman, the Trucial coast and Katr, which inconvenience an innocuous modus vivendi, arranged if necessary with the knowledge of the Porte, would obviate. It is not a question of any desire to interfere in politics of Central Arabia. Bin Sand is now at the coast, and lor us it is a question of a new menace to our interests in the Gulf sphere which we need either to sterilise or protect ourselves against. Surely there is no logical reason why the interests of our proteges should suffer severely because Porte cannot control one of hers. If the Government of India share my apprehensions perhaps this aspect of the question should be commended to the further consideration of His Majesty’s Government.”r* In any further communication on this subject, please quote No . 35805/13. and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

IN compliance with the request which, under instructions from your Government, you were good enough to make to me on the 16th ultimo, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copies of the agreements concluded by His Majesty’s Government with the Trucial chiefs of Oman and the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit, to which reference is made in the memorandum communicated to your Highness on the 29th July last. With respect to these agreements His Majesty’s Government have the following observations to make :— As regards No. 1, His Majesty’s Government have informed the Sheikh of Koweit that so long as he and his heirs and successors act up to their obligations under the agreement, His Majesty’s Government undertake to support them and accord them their good offices. His Majesty’s Government reserve to themselves the right to interpret that term at their discretion. His Majesty’s Government hold, moreover, a lease of land from the Sheikh of Koweit. As regards No. 4, His Majesty’s Government take occasion to remind the Sublime Porte that British rights in the Persian Gulf and on the coast rest not merely on the agreements concluded, and transmitted herewith to the Ottoman Government, but on the custom, consent, and long-established relations between the local chiefs and the Government of India. His Majesty’s Government hope that in the communication of these agreements, together with the supplementary declarations which are hereby brought to the notice of the Ottoman Government, the Sublime Porte will see proof of His Majesty’s Government’s goodwill and desire to facilitate the conclusion of the negotiations set forth in their above-mentioned memorandum.

In this fear the two Sheikhs have decided to mobilize their Bedouins in the Sabakhat and Matti (vide page 1,200, Persian Gulf Gazetteer), and take the initiative against Bin Sand. “ Thei-e having been nothing unfriendly in our reply to Bin Sand, I should not imagine that he would think it worth while to hostilize us by [? such] action but of course the state of Oman generally at present offers him a very favourable opening if he be so disposed.

Lord Lansdowne doubted the wisdom of negotiating with the tribes of Nejd, and To India Sir N.

(No. 34.) Sir, Basra, May 31, 1913. WITH reference to my despatch No. 33 of 23rd May on the subject of Hassa I have the honour to report that Nedim Bey, ex-Mutessarif of Hassa, the cadi, and several Turkish officials with their families, accompanied by thirty gendarmes, arrived from Hofuf and Katif by the slow mail. It is reported that Bin Saoud sequestered £ T. 8,500 of the Turkish revenue at Hofuf, and seized all arms and ammunition, mules, and horses, but gave the soldiers £ T. 400 for their expenses to Basra, and permitted them to take their rifles and ten rounds of ammunition each with them. It is also stated that the Mai Nudiri of Katif, on his arrival at Ojeir, gave the soldiers £ T. 1,700 for their expenses out of revenue which he had collected and which did not fall into the hands of Bin Saoud. I hear that a letter was recently received by the vali from Bin Saoud, who stated that his father had entrusted the government of Hassa to the Turks for the past forty-three years for the purpose of improving the town and the people and assuring commercial security. The Turks had done nothing and the condition of the country had gone from bad to worse. All complaints had-been disregarded and he had, therefore, taken Hassa away from the Turks again. He maintained, nevertheless, that he was the loyal and faithful servant of the Sultan, but stated that if the Turkish Government attempted to retake Hassa he was prepared to oppose them. The vali stated that in his opinion it would be difficult to take any action in the direction of Hassa during the hot weather. Ajcymi-bin-Sadun, who still remains in the vicinity of Basra, has telegraphed to the Grand Vizier and sent copies of his message to the Ministers of War and the Interioi. He attributes the present unrest to the baneful influence of Seyyid Talib Bey and his machinations, and says that as the vali did not take his (Ajeymi s) advice and suppress Talib Bey, the latter found occasion to incite Bin Saoud to revolt and capture Hassa. He further slates that out of loyalty to the Ottoman Government he has collected his tribes and is keeping them under arms in order to assist the Turkish troops against the rebellious Arabs of Basra, and that he has ordered Bin Reshffi to join him with his tribes “ in order to break the backbone of the enemies of the State, who sell then religion, their country, and their Government, and to deliver Hassa out of the hands of the^rebels.” He also lays great emphasis on what he describes as Seyyid Talib Bey s nefarious intrigues, and says the latter is concerting with the foreign consu s to biing about a state of things which will end in a revolution. He concludes by demanding the exile of Talib Bey from Basra. . , , Ajeymi-bin-Sadun has not followed up the verbal message which I received from him on the 27th instant or sent me any further communication, and it is probable that the overture w x as merely a ballon d'essai I am inclined to believe that the shei_ i s appearance m the neighbourhood of Basra has been pi eai ranged by t e 1 authorities. They are not at all disconcerted by it and their efforts to remove him oo not seem to me sincere. They may look upon him as a counteracting influence and [2950 egg—3] 'Vc : V . f . ... n I r 1&amp; OUL 1 S I -J2 hope to play him off against Arab political aspirations or divert the attention of the notables from schemes for decentralisation and autonomy by encouraging the very general belief that the Montific chief is about to raid the town. Seyyid Palib Bey and Ajeymi are evidently on bad terms and do not spare one another, and it seems to be the aim and object of the adherents of either party to keep their principals apart]® From an Arab point of view Ajeymi may, perhaps, attribute to Talib Bey some share oi the responsibility for his fathers death, in so far that Sadun was lalib s guest when treacherously caught by the Turks in 1911. 1 have made many enquiries into the matter and am given to understand that Talib Bey was in no way cognisant of the circumstances which led to Sadun’s capture, and the only stigma which can really attach to him is his failure to rescue the Montific chief from the clutches of the Turkish Government after the arrest had been effected—a task, I am informed, which was beyond his power, though he is said to have done his best to help him. In any case, the present message of Ajeymi makes it clear that the object of his coming is either to take Seyyid Talib’s life or bring about his removal from Basra. A composite battalion of 200 soldiers arrived yesterday from Bagdad, on board the ‘‘ Mosul,” but there is no news yet regarding the movements of the John O’Scott ” with the Turkish garrison from Hassa. The “ Marmariss ” is expected here very shortly. Captain Cowley, to whom I yesterday entrusted Sir E. Grey’s message to Sheikh Falih-el-Benaiya, as reported in my telegram No. 38 of the 28th instant, informed me that, in his opinion, both Falih and Ghadban are not likely to hold up the river traffic to any serious extent, though they may cause some annoyance to passing vessels by firing on them. He gave me to understand that Sheikh Ghadban was anxious to keep on good terms with the Government and had, in fact lately joined his uncle Shebib for that purpose. It will be remembered that Sheikh Falih-el-Benaiya, when he visited me in March, told me a very different story, and said he and his brother had killed their uncle Shebib. I have, &amp;c. F. E.

I HAVE the honour to report the following items of military information :— One hundred and forty recruits from Bagdad and Basra proceeded to Hodeida by the Russian steamer “Vesta” on the 16th instant. Colonel Abdul Jabar with one other officer of the 112th regiment and ten deserters from the Hassa force, accompanying 120 cases of ammunition, proceeded by the British India steamer “ Baroda” to Bahrein, on the 20th instant, en route for Hassa. Between 150 and 180 men of the Gadro Tabouri arrived on the 21st instant in the river steamer “ Bagdad,” from Arnara, for service at Basra. Hofuf, the capital of El Hassa, surrendered to Bin Saoud about the 5th instant, and Katif surrendered to him on the 15th instant. The steamship “John O’Scott proceeded to Ojeir and Katif and embarked the Hassa garrison and returned to Bahrein on the 18th instant with 500 to 600 Turkish troops on board, according to a report received from the British Resident at Bushire, and with 300 men only according to the British India Company’s agents. It is believed that the vessel will proceed to Basra shortly. The Hassa garrison last December consisted of 290 men of the 2nd battalion 112th regiment, 280 men of the Cadro bolouki, and 150 men of the 3rd battalion 112th regiment. The Mutessarif of Hassa, in a report dated the 30th April (13th May), states that Bin Saoud and his Arabs made a breach in the wall surrounding Ho tut and entered the town on the 22nd April (5th May). He asserts that the garrison held out at the barracks, and fought for twenty hours against the Arabs, and that tlm town and neighbouring villages were finally captured owing to the treachery of the inhabitants. Other reports, however, state that the town surrendered to the Arabs without opposition. The military commander of the force m Hassa, in a letter addressed to the commandant here states that Hassa has fallen, and the troops surrendered in order to save their ' The Minister of the Interior telegraphed that the Turkish cruiser “ Hamidieh ” has left Aden for Basra, and the Turkish consul at Bombay, in reply to enquiries as to when the “ Marmaris ” would return, is understood to have telegraphed to the commodoie for 90,000 rupees (600L), in order to pay the balance due for repairing the vessel, on receipt of which she would return to Basra. On Tuesday night, the 20th instant, the lurkish authorities sent out gendarmes to intercept a private launch belonging to an Arab merchant, which was conveying certain respectable Arab sheikhs from the Euphrates to Basra, on the pretext that the launch was bringing arms. Several volleys were fired on the launch without any casualties, and a seyyid on board was struck and roughly handled and finally imprisoned by Ferid Bey, the divisional commandant, who was, I am assured, intoxicated at the time. Sheikh Mizel, of the El Hassan tribe, and three other sheikhs with him in the launch, evaded the gendarmes and reached Talib Bey s house in safety. 1 he seyyid Bey was subsequently released at the instance of Talib Bey. u ^ I have, &amp;c.

GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure in No. 1. Consul Crow to Sir G. Lowther. (No. 30.) Sir, Basra, May 18, 1913. I HAVE the honour to report that the firman of the new vali was read at the serai without incident on the 10th instant. Ajeymi-bin-Sadun has arrived at Shaeba, about an hour’s distance from Basra. He asked the vali to meet him there, and said he had something to say which he could not communicate in writing. The vali despatched the mudir of police and a few gendarmes to receive the message. Ajeymi is reported to have told the mudir of police that he had been instructed to come to Basra by the inspector of gendarmerie (Lutfi Bey) who had recently visited Nasriyeh. He handed the mudir a letter for the vali. The Minister of the Interior has telegraphed to Seyyid Talib Bey thanking him for the information he has given respecting Ajeymi’s movements, and expressing the hope that the latter would be induced to go away peaceably. I am informed that the authorities are endeavouring to persuade Ajeymi by amicable means to return to Montific, as they have not sufficient force at their command to coerce him. He has promised to do so, but is, I hear, still in the near neighbourhood with a following of 1,500 Arabs. The vah, I am informed, suggested that Ajeymi should be given a decoration of some sort and a fixed allowance as an inducement to good behaviour. The Arab notables, however, objected to this, observing that his professed loyalty to Government would be better shown by his returning to Montific than by remaining in the neighbourhood of Basra with so large a following. They considered his present attitude was a distinct menace to the town. On the evening of the 17th instant I was invited with the commander and officeis of the “Alert ” to dine at Seyyid Talib Bey’s house. On our arrival I found him engaged with correspondence received that evening by the slow mail from Bin Saoud, informing him that he had occupied Hassa, and was sending the mutessarif, civil ^ officials, and garrisons with their arms to Basra, and stating that he had given them £ 1. 300 foi the journey. The letter conveying this intelligence, so Talib Bey informed me, contained expressions of loyalty to the Sultan, hut complained of the mismanagement of Hassa affairs bv the Turkish officials and the non-payment of the allowance pieviously granted him by Government. I was given to understand that Bin Saoud expressed the opinion that, as the population of Hassa consisted of Arabs under his allegiance, the present situation was merely a return to the normal condition of affairs which had previously existed there. I was also told that a letter addressed to the vah was enclosed m Seyyid Talib Bey’s correspondence, and that Bin Saoud described himself m this letter as an obedient servant of the Ottoman Government; the delivery of the letter to the vali was left to Sevyid Talib Bey’s discretion. ., m , . . . The occupation of Hassa by Bin Saoud would, in Seyyid Tahb Bey s opinion, have a natural reflex action on the Arabs of Bagdad and Basra. He gave me no hint a^ to the possible result, and it w ould be premature at this juncture to anticipate its eltect, but 1 should think the news would cause a profound and far-reaching impression Ihe report reached me in telegrams from the British Resident at Bushire on t e 14 i an 15th instant, which were immediately repeated to the embassy.

Meanwhile, Political Agent, Bahrein, reports that envoy of Bin Saud has arrived at Bahrein en route for Basra with telegrams to Constantinople explaining Amir’s action has been forced upon him in public interests, and that he entertains utmost loyalty to Sublime Porte. Political Agent suggests that we are thus afforded favourable opportunity to assist Bin Saud on lines suggested in my telegram ‘of 25th May, No. 937. I therefore venture to suggest consideration of expediency of adding to my reply to Bin Saud a sentence saying that we should be glad to see him reconciled to Turks and to assist in promoting such reconciliation.

(Confidential and Immediate). No. 29,150. Foreign Office, ki 1 ’, 2nd July 1913. With reference to my letter of 2 f)th June, I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to state that he has had under careful con sideration the despatch dated 26th May 1913 from His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire to the Government of India, and the enclosure, a despatch dated loth May 1913, from the Political Agent at Koweit, respecting the situation in Nejd. Sir E. Grey has learnt with regret that Captain Shakespear recently spent four days in the camp of Bin Sand, a course which does not seem to have been a necessary condition of any mission with which that officer may have been charged in the “ hinterland of Koweit,” and one which is obviously calculated to arouse suspicions with regard to British aspirations and intentions. Captain Shakespear, in paragraph 10 of his report writes : “ . “ On the other hand to reject the Amir’s overtures will assuredly cause “ a feeling of resentment which may react upon our interests along the “ whole Arabian littoral of the Gulf. . . .” Sir E. Grey is not in a position to gauge the accuracy of this forecast ; but he is fully convinced that the consequences of any such resentment would be unimportant by comparison with those which might result from the establishment of direct relations between the Amir and His Majesty’s Government. Sir P. Cox, in forwarding Captain Shakespear’s report and commenting upon it after the fall of Hasa and Katif, observes: “ It is difficult to see how the Porte with an empty exchequer and with trouble brewing simultaneously in the Bussorah vilayet, can hope for some time to come to undertake punitive operations against Bin Sand. In any case, if any attempt is made to operate by sea, we shall at once be faced with the question as to whether our policy in the Gulf will admit of our acquiescing in such a course, which in all probability would prove abortive and leave to us a legacy of bitter resentment on the part of Bin Sand.” I am to state that Sir E. Grey fails to see why Bis Majesty’s Government need interfere in any way whatsoever in such a contingency as that indicated ; he considers that their attitude should be one of strict neutrality. In view of this and recent despatches from British officers in the Persian Gulf, Sir E. Grey is of opinion that further and more stringent telegraphic instructions should be issued to Sir P. Cox enjoining upon him and his subordinates to abstain carefully from any communication whatsoever, other than that of a purely formal nature where inevitable, with Bin Sand or any other Arabian Chief with whom His Majesty’s Government have not treaty relations. The cardinal factor of British policy, which is based upon con siderations not purely local, is to uphold the integrity of the Turkish dominions in Asia.

Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant224. Tlie Political Agent left on a tour in the desert on the 2nd March, but left Movements D f his camp at War a Hill and returned on the 5th with Mr. E. H. Pascoe, who had His Majesty’s r 0 - accompanied him thither in connection with the Kuwait water-scheme, vide paragraph presentative * 218 above. The Political Agent left and rejoined his camp at Wara'llill on the 8th and reached As-Safa wells on the 14th and Al-Gara’a wells on the loth. After leaving Al-GaraT, wells he marched south-west through the Suman and Dahana districts and onwards vii Gwiyiya wells to Majma’a town which he reached on the 24th. He spent a day there with Abdullah bin Askar, the Amir of the place, who was most friendly and hospitable; the Political Agent had met him before in the desert and also in Kuwait. Majma’a is a small town of perhaps 5,000 inhabitants with large date gardens around it. Hearing that Bin Saud was within three days’ march and near the Political Agent’s proposed route, the Political Agent decided to diverge to his camp and renew his acquaintance.MINUTE. The oonourr&amp;noe of the Foreign Off toe having been obtained, the attached draft telegram is now submitted for issue. Meanwhile a further telegram has been received from Sir P. Cox, showing that Bin Baud has renewed his overtures, and that his envoy is v)aiting at Bahrein till the 3rd July for a reply. So far as we Know, his complaint that assistcmce was given by the British representative at Bahrein to the Turkish troops is quite unfounded. On the contrary, at the instance of the Political Agent and of the Resident, Persian Gulf, (see Sir P. Cox's telegram of Sth June) w remonstrated vrtth the Porte against the use of Bahrein as a base of operations, and were assured in reply that Turkish troops would not go there again.(see Sir G.Lowther's telegram of 9th June) There seems to be nothing in Sir P.Cox's telegram calling for a modification of our instructions to India or of the general policy of non-intervention in Bin Baud's affairs, but a sentence has been added to the draft telegram with the object of eliciting from the Government of India any suggestions they may wish to make on this further development of the situation. They nay possibly, for example, think it desirable that Bin Baud should be made azmre of our real attitude I on the Bahrein question.In any further communication on this subject, please quote No. 28291/13 Foreign Office and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

With reference to Secretary of State’s telegram of 10th June regarding (? message) from Bin Sand. Amir has sent his former emissary to Bahrein with letters dated 13th dune to Political Agent in analogous terms. Amir begins by referring to long standing friendship which has existed between his family and British Government, and refers to agreement entered into' by his grandfather 55 years ago ; which I presume to be that given to Colonel Pelly 21st April 1866. He then remonstrates against alleged assistance given by British representative to Turkish troops operating from Bahrein. He continues that he is most anxious to preserve time-honoured friendship, and binds himself to accord good treatment and protection to British subjects and desires similar assurances from us. Similarly, if the position has changed and we are not willing to maintain former friendly relations as he greatly desires, he asks to be definitely informed, so that he can look after his own interests. He concludes by saying he awaits reply in all anxiety. His envoy is waiting in Bahrein, and mail leaves here on 3rd July.wltui i , ( r fL,kJ O CONFIDENTIAL. f c S ' i t v..

Enclosure No. 1 is an interesting report addressed to me before Captain Shakespear had heard of the fall of Hasa and Katif. It is no doubt somewhat awkward from our point of view that Bin Saud should have proceeded to extremities at the present stage of the Anglo-lurkish Neeociations, and so soon after a friendly meeting with our Agent, but howeve inconvenient the coincidence of events_ may be, the juncture was obviously an ideal one for Bin Saud to choose, and it would seem that the only course, whether for ourselves or the Turks, is to look the practical position in the ace.^ It is difficult to see how the Porte with an empty Exchequer and with trouble brewing simultaneously in the Basrah Vilayat can hope for some time to come to undertake punitive operations against Bin Sau . n any c » Inv attempt is made to operate by sea, we shall at once be faced with the any attemp r in the Gul{ will ac j mlt 0 f 0 ur acquiescing in such T course, h which in all probability would prove abortive and leave to us a legacy of bitter resentment on the part of Bin Saud.

A f* . . - t v \ \ I No. C.-io, dated Kuwait, the 15 th May From-CAPTAIN W. H. I. Shakespear, LA , Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with your Second Assistant's endorsement No. 528, dated the . 6 th February .913. o In the course of my recent tour in the Kuwait hinterland this spring I • Abdul Aziz ‘‘ Bin Saud ”, the Amir of Nejd, and spent four days m hfsTadp He and his brothers were all apparently very glad to renew our old I A. C25FDacquaintance and my reception in the camp was every whit as friendly and hospitable as on the former occasion in March \gii. The Amir was anxious to hear the latest news of the Turko-Balkan war as well as an account of its course ^ as he said that he was unable to believe the accounts which reached him from t either Turkish sources or Egyptian newspapers, for although these contained descriptions of many Turkish successes, the Turkish troops always seemed to be eivinv ground and he had heard from Kuwait and Bahrain that the Ottoman army th?n held only the Capital, some forts within a day’s march, and a few other isolated towns, the whole of the rest of European Turkey having been absorbed by the Balkan Allies. I give him such information as there was (news of the fall of Adrianople had not then been received) and was surprised to find that so far from a pro-Turkish spirit being evinced, the contrary was expressed and the Amir, his brothers and the Nejd notables in camp all seemed to consider that Turkey’s misfortunes and present weakness furnished the best opportunity for Nejd to rid itself of all shadow of Ottoman suzerainty and to drive their troops from Hasa and Katif. 3. I would here invite a reference to my report No. C.-17 of the 8 th April ioil,asmuch of the conversation I had with “ Bin ^aud on the present occasion was merely a recapitulation of what I have already submitted two years ago. I will endeavour now only to show what effects the events of the two years since elapsed, the Italian war in Tripoli and the Turko-Balkan war have had on the Amir’s opinions and ambitions. He spoke with even greater vehe mence of his hatred of the Turks and was manifestly disappointed that I could give him no encouragement nor even the faintest hope that his ambitions would have the approval, tacit, disguised or otherwise of the British Government. I was at pains to explain that we were on friendly terms with the Turkish Government, were in negotiation with them over certain matters regarding the Baghdad Rail way and the Persian Gulf and that the present of all times was most unsuitable for us to embark on any championship of his claims, even if we were vyilling to do so, which so far as I could see was not the case. I hough disappointed he showed no annoyance or resentment but merely remarked that some day we h would be forced by circumstances to take up his case. 4. The Amir said that since he had last spoken of the matter to me Turkey had been through two wars in both of which she had shown her incapability in military matters and that the Arabs consequently felt equal to evicting the Turkish troops from Hasa and Katif with the greatest of ^ase. I hey were all agreed that no opportunity is ever likely to offer better than the present when with her army broken and disorganised, her finances crippled and her Arab subjects in Iraq and Syria all demanding reforms and self-government, Turkey would certainly be much too occupied in her other Asiatic provinces and in recuperating after the war’s conclusion to despatch a serious expedition to Hasa or Nejd. He said, moreover, that it was firmly believed by Arabs that the Turkish reverses were the judgment of the Almighty on a people who, calling themselves Musalmans, had for years neglected their faith, oppressed their subjects, embezzled religious endowments, broken every ordinance of the Koran and subverted the Khilafat. He averred that the present Sultan was in no sense the Khaiifa, holding his throne as he does as the puppet of a clique of politicians in Constantinople whose only object was the filling of their own pockets and who would be ready to find another Khalifa tomorrow if a change should suit them better. The Arabs were not blind and they could not help contrasting _ the justice, truth, equity, material prosperity and religious freedom which obtained under the rule of other nations and more particularly under the British flag, with what they saw under Turkish government. Sentiments of the above descrip tion were not expressed secretly nor do I think especially for my benefit but such speech was held openly at almost every gathering of the Amir and his headmen and I certainly formed the impression that Turkey’s misfortunes had induced no sympathy for herself as a power but had rather been taken as conclusive proof that as the Turks had neglected their religion so had the Almighty abandoned them and therefore it behoved all good Wahabis to rid themselves of all inter course with such backsliders and reprobates. Such briefly appears to have been the effect on the minds of the more educated and responsible men of Nejd.5. In discussing his own ambitions “ Bin Saud ” said that the moment had tiOw arrived when he must chose his definite policy for the future. By the Grace of God his power in Central Arabia had increased until he no longer feared any of its Shaikhs or Rulers, he was moreover in alliance with all of them excepting only one, viz., the Sharif of Mecca, who, fearing a second Wahabi invasion of the Hejaz had therefore allied himself with the Turks. The As-Saud were prepared to hold what they had recovered during the last fifteen years of their ancient dominion in Arabia, and felt capable of being able to do so comparatively easily but for the menace of Turkish aggression, only possible from the east by way of Hasa and from the west by Mecca and Medina. To withstand the Turks from both directions they felt was beyond their strength and to render secure their eastern borders, thus making their full force available for the defence of their western boundaries, was one of the reasons for their desire to evict the Turks from Hasa and Katif. Another most important one was that the posses sion of these rich districts with their ports and especially Ojair, would furnish a valuable source of revenue to what was at present an extremely poor state. Moreover the As-Saud had other grounds and just ones for their claim to Hasa and Katif; one was that these districts formerly belonged to their house, another was that the Turks themselves in a document given to Abdulla bin Faisal by Nafiz Pasha, the General who commanded Midhat Pasha’s expedition to Katif in 1871, had agreed that the area should belong to and be governed by Abdulla and his family. The Amir informed me that this document had only recently come into his possession and on his return to Riadh he would send me a copy. Another document of which he had heard but so far had not f succeeded in tracing was one which purported to be an agreement made by Colonel Sir Lewis Pelly guaranteeing on behalf of the British Government that the As-Saud family would be recognised as the Shaikhs of the Katif district. This document he said was the result of negotiations after the naval^ action at Katif and Dammam (in 1865) when four men named Mahomed bin Maana, Abdul Aziz bin Umr, Saleh al Widawi and Ibrahim bin Ghanim w T ere sent by Faisal As-Saud as his representatives to the Resident. I have no archives with which to test the accuracy of the Amir's assertions, but I find a^ Declaration printed on page 156 of Aitchison’s Treaties, Volume XII, as No. XXVIII which j seems to bear on this transaction. i 6. Of late years and particularly during their wars with Italy and the Balkan States Turkish officials have been pressing Abdul Aziz to assist them practically with men and money and to show himself a loyal subject of the Sultan, faj by sending three of the As-Saud family to Constantinople for education and service in the Ottoman Army, fdj by acknowledging Turkish suzerainty openly in the acceptance of a Turkish title with a firman from the Sultan appointing him Governor of Nejd, and (c) by handing over to thern all letters and documents which may have passed at any time between British officials and the As-Saud family, particularly that referred to above. Hitherto he had refused in as polite language as was possible knowing that once the Turks gained any hold over hinThe would in truth eventually become a Turkish subject, which he did not admit himself to be at present and then there would be no security for himself or his house. He w ? as, however, beginning to feel the pressure, for all the Arab leaders, Ibn Rashid and the like, had rejected similar Turkish overtures with the answer that they were prepared to comply as soon as they &lt;;aw “Bin Saud” doing so, for they had as little cause to love the iurks as he had himself, and desired to maintain their present independence. Thus it would be seen that Arabia might be said to be awaiting his lead. 7 The Turks besides are convinced that some kind of understanding actually exists between the As-Saud and the British Government and this belief is one of the reasons for their repeated efforts to make him renounce hi^rp^nt complete independence. He himself is willing to make public any definite understanding with us for the fact of its existence would relieve him of the Turkish menace. Unless he is fortified by some understanding with the British Government which, however nebulous it might be, would make the Turks hesitate from attacking him gratuitously, he would always be subject to intrigues; though at present allied to the other important chiefs in Arabia he could nothope that such alliances fg^^^w^ile^fferablTto hold his own against exploited to the ^most by the Tu,Us Whtle . ons among th h Ibn Rashid or other Rulers an g, ss i st his enemies would probably aware that the addition of Turk P d • either to ask for British protection be his undoing.

Fhe unrest and desire for emancipation from Turkish rule .s not confined to Ne]d. The press contains accounts of similar movements for self-government m Syria, Bevrout, Baghdad and Basrah, in Basrah 1 am informed that the new Wall on hi/arrival a few days ago was bluntly told that unless he fell into hue with local notables he had better re-embark at once for Constantinople. IO l venture to submit this report in the hope that serious attention may be directed to “ Bin Saud ” and Central Arabian affairs. The man is a ruler ot the best Arab type and his personally is one which is likely to lead Arabia should any extensive combination come into being among its tribes, an event which to me seems exceedingly probable in the near future, unless some radical change takes place in Turkish policy towards the Arabs. As soon as some such combination occurs and perhaps even before, I do not think that there is the least dou t a Bin Saud’s” first move will be on Hasa and Katif, and when . PP 6 / 18 1 seems to me that we shall be forced into relations with the Amir of Nejd, how ever much we may desire to avoid them. At present he is most friendly and inclined even to bind himself in some degree, for he has already expressed asmuch in his letter to me regarding the capture of his arms at Shargab, forwarded with my letter No. C.-7 of the 29th April 1913. How far he would go in putting this desire into the words of a documentary agreement is uncertain but I am inclined to believe that it would be a very long way if he had reason to think that we would assist him in effecting the removal of the Turks from Hasa and Katif. That we would ever find a method to assist him diplomatically in this direction I confess does not seem possible at present, for our success hitherto in a somewhat similar case, vis., the evacuation of the Umr Kasr and other Turkish posts on Kuwait boundaries, where we had far stronger grounds for exerting pressure on the Porte, has been infinitesimal. On the other hand to reject the Amir’s overtures will assuredly cause a feeling of resentment which may re-act upon our interests along the whole Arabian littoral of the Gulf, perhaps not at once, but in the near future as “ Bin Baud’s ” power increases, for increase it will so long as Abdul Aziz and his brothers are alive. II. Exactly what have been our relations with the As-Saud family in the past, for want of early records I do not know and whether they would warrant any move in the direction desired by the Amir I am not in a position to suggest. I am aware, however, that we had frequently to take punitive measures against the Wahabis for interference with the Trucial Chiefs and Bahrain, but in this connection now I am convinced that “ Bin Baud” would be only too glad to furnish us with any undertaking we desired for the maintenance of the “ status quo ” in the future. In conclusion I have the honour to solicit your support for a re-considera tion of the whole question of our relations with the Amir of Nejd for I cannot avoid the impression that the matter will become an urgent one before long and that it will be to our advantage to have reached beforehand some definite decision in regard to our future relations with “ Bin Baud ”. No. C.- 12 , dated Kuwait, the 2oth May 1913 . From— CAPTAIN W. H. I. Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to your Second Assistant’s endorsement No. 1522, dated the 13th May 1913, forwarding areport from Bahrain of the occupation of Hasa by “ Bin Baud ”, I have the honour to submit the details of the incident which have now reached Kuwait. 2. The news which was received with the greatest surprise in Kuwait, was first supplied by passengers and letters from Bahrain arriving here by last mail on the 15th May. From this source there were various accounts which it is unnecessary to recapitulate for in the morning of the 17th May special messengers with letters from Bin Baud ” reached Kuwait overland. 3 I saw Shaikh Mubarak in the afternoon and the course of events appears to have been as follows“ Bin Baud ” collected a very large force of Nejd townsmen and marched rapidly from Riadh accompanied by some, though not many Bedouin until he arrived within five hours of Hofhuf in the forenoon of the 27th lamadi-al-Awal (4th May 1913)- Here he assembled his head-men and explained to them how, owing'to Turkish ineptitude the Bedouin tribes near Hasa were always raiding, how bad characters whom he desired to punish took refuge in the Hasa villages and the Turkish officials were obstructive and shielded them, how he was weary of the want of security in this district and how he had for years received invitations from the Hasa Arabs and now, haying arrived within 5 hours of Hofhuf, he asked his Shaikhs to state whether they agreed with him that the Turks should be turned out for good and all or not. The headmen and Shaikhs replied that they were prepared to follow him. In the afternoon “ Bin Baud ” intimated to his Shaikhs that he required only 300 picked men for the actual attack and when these had been selected the party started. On arrival at a spot about an hour or less to the west of Hofhuf itself short y after sunset the camels and horses were left parked, ropes collected and other preparations made ; “ Bin Baud ” and his men then proceeded on foot until6 close to the walls. At about two hours after midnight r the party proceeded to scale the walls, the ropes were quickly taken to the top by men chmbmg upon each other's shoulders and as soon as a good number were over the wall a move was made to open the western gate for the remainder. It was not until this moment that the Turkish sentries became alarmed. On the alarm being given some firing took place near the gate, probably with the gate-guard, in which eight Turks and*four of “ Bin Saud’s ” men were killed. The Turks all retreated to the central fort known as Kut, while the populat.on came out and welcomed u g- c auc i » “ Bi n Saud ” then sent envoys accompanied by some of the Hasa notable to the Mutassarrif and Commandant pointing out the futility of opposition and offering them a safe conduct if they would surrender immediate y and agree to remove themselves and their belongings. He also undertook to allow them to keep their arms and to provide them with transport to the coast, but insisted that the troops must leave at once permitting only one or two days grace to those Turks who had families. The Mutassarrif surrendered at noon on the 5th May and so far assisted “ Bin Saud ”, as to send messages to outing detachments also to surrender. Within the Government buildings in the Kut Bin Saud obtained treasure to the extent of 40,000 dollars, 12 guns of different calibres, 2 mitrailleuses and a large quantity of reserve rifles and ammunition. 4 Messengers were also sent to Katif accompanied by Shiah notables and the chief Shiah Muitahid in Hasa with a letter from the Mutassarrif to the Kaimakam ordering him to surrender, with what result has not yet become known. “ Bin Saud” has also occupied Ojair, and replaced the Turkish Customs staff by his own men. He appears to have insisted on every 1 urkish soldier and official leaving at the earliest possible moment. t;. Kuwaitis are surprised at the boldness and success of Bin Saud s coup and opinion is divided as to what steps the 1 urkish Government will take, the general idea being that Turkey will be too occupied with her own affairs in Basrah to be able to spare any troops for Hasa at present but that l a ^ r on she may be expected to send an expedition by sea against “ Bin Saud Shaikh Mubarak himself seems inclined to think that the Turks will make the best of a bad job and dub “ Bin Saud ” Mutassarrif of ftejd, leaving him to govern alone as he chooses, for the Hasa province has never paid its way, all Customs receipts being swallowed up in doles and subsidies to petty Bedouin Shaikhs in a vain endeavour to make them desist from looting caravans and threatening Turkish detachments. 6. I confess I am surprised at the suddenness of “ Bin Saud’s ” attack, for while I expected it to come sooner or later I gathered the impression that he would wait to see what effect the movements for self-government in other Arab “rovinces would have on Turkish policy before actually committing himself. Jrom other aspects it seems clear he could hardly have selected a better moment or managed the affair more deftly as he appears to have secured the support of the responsible men of Hasa itself. f2 M * -4- ^ From Viceroy, ISth June 1913.

I have no idea whether His Majesty’s Government contemplate letting matters adjust themselves or whether they intend to offer any advice to the Porte. On the one hand, we seem freshly committed by Convention to recognition of Turkish suzerainty over Nejd ; on the other hand, if Bin Saud is to be de facto ruler thereof our interests and work in the Gulf demand that we should have definite and friendly relations with him with least possible delay. Might it not be conceivably possible to get Turks to look facts in the face and with our help to arrange and include in the Convention a satisfactory solution of the problem ; the basis being that Bin Saud should be recognised as autonomous ruler of Nejd under the suzerainty of the Porte, and that we should be accorded the right to accredit an agent to him as one of the maritime rulers and make agreements with him, with the knowledge of the Porte, in connection with the suppression of arms traffic, slave trade, and piracy, and our mission in the Gulf generally ? Of course the complete emancipation of Nejd from Turkish domination would be more satisfactory but we seem too committed to the lurks to countenance that. “ I have offered above observations with diffidence and on grounds that matter [may ?] require urgent consideration.” . It seems impossible at this late hour to raise question of status of Nejd without running the risk of wrecking the negotiations.

It concerns Britain's relations with Bin Saud [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd] following the latter's occupation of Ottoman-ruled El Hassa [Al Hasa] and Nejd [Najd]. Much of the correspondence is concerned with how Bin Saud's occupation of Nejd and El Hassa will affect the continuing Anglo-Turkish negotiations [for the Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913, which was never ratified] and British foreign policy in the region more generally.Also discussed in the volume are the following: whether the British should allow the transhipment of Ottoman troops in Bahrein waters; a visit (regarded after the event as 'ill-advised' by the Secretary of State for India) paid by the Political Agent, Koweit [Kuwait], Captain William Henry Irvine Shakespear, to Bin Saud, at Majma'a [Al Majma], six weeks before Bin Saud occupied El Hassa; the death of Sheikh Jasim-bin-thani [Shaikh Jāsim bin Muḥammad Āl Thānī, Ruler of Qatar]; British hopes of securing the early withdrawal of the Turkish garrison from El Katr [Qatar]; reports that the Turkish Government intends to respond to the events in Nejd by appointing Bin Saud as Mutessarif [Mutasarrif] of the district.The following principal correspondents appear in the volume: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Sir Percy Zachariah Cox; the Viceroy of India [Charles Hardinge]; the Secretary of State for India, the Marquess of Crewe [Robert Offley Ashburton Crewe-Milnes]; the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for India, Thomas William Holderness; His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, Gerard Augustus Lowther; the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Sir Edward Grey; the Political Agent, Koweit; Bin Saud.The part includes a divider that gives the subject and part number, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references contained in the part by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Permanent Under-Secretary of State for India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia 'Abd al-'Azīz bin 'Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa'ūd</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>El Hassa</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Nejd</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign policy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military occupation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Conventions</topic></subject><subject><topic>Anglo-Ottoman Convention (1913)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000117#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
