Memorandum on the Russo-Perso-Afghan Frontier. If the Russian Government is prepared seriously to undertake the delimi- tation of a line of frontier between the Afghan and Turcoman territory in the desert bounded by the Heri-Rud on one side, and by the Oxus on the other, it would seem indispensable that a British Commissioner should attend to watch the proceedings in the interest of our ally the Amir of Cabul, but I am bound to say that I do not believe any practical result would attend surveying operations in such a country. Of course it would be simple enough to draw a line upon the map eastward trom perakhs, or from some point on the Heri-Rud south of Serakhs, and to pro long it to the Oxus, crossing the Murghab in the neighbourhood of Ak-Tepeh letweeu lellatun and Penj-deh, but it must be remembered that in the whole ot this interval between the western and eastern extremities of the line (except perhaps on the immediate bank of the Murghab), there is no trace of per manent habitation, nor any definite landmark, nor, except in the Murghdb valley, any well, or watercourse, or even artificial cistern. In winter and spring the ram water lies in pools on the surface of the plain, and as there is abundance of herbage the Turcomans of the Salor, Saryk, and Ersari tribes past ure their flocks generally throughout the desert, so that at that season a strong surveying party might cross from one river to the other, but at other times of the year the route across the desert eastward from berakhs would be wholly impracticable, and most unsuited therefore for a definite line of frontier. In ancient times the high road from Serakhs to the eastward made a considerable detour to the south, so as to skirt the hills of Badgheis, crossing the Murghdb at Morv-er-Riid (modern ileruehak) one stage south of Penj-deh, and then running north-east along the skirts of the Afghan hills to the Oxus, by which means the desert was avoided, and a sufficient water supply was everywhere secured On topographical grounds, then, it would seem of the first necessity that, if any continuous frontier line is to be drawn, the same route should be pursued which is given in detail in our Geographical Proceedings, New Series, Vol V , page 16, a general distinction being thus observed between the Turcoman desert on the left hand and the Afghan hills upon the right. A still more important consideration, however, is raised by the condition of the tribes through whose territory the line of frontier would pass. If the line of demarcation were drawn due east from Serakhs, or the immediate neighbourhood, it would assign to Afghanistan the Salors on the Heri-Rud, one half of the Saryks on the Murghab, and a large portion of the Ersari, belonging to the desert between the Murghab and the Oxus; and it is beyond dispute that the subjection to the jurisdiction of Herat of such intractable materials as these foreign outlying tribes would be a never- failing source of weakness, irritation, and danger. The fact is, that under the proposed Russian settlement the Amir of Cabul is threatened, not with a loss of territory, but with having a greater extent of jurisdiction assigned to him than he desires or can adequately manage. It is true that 30 years a^o the Afghan tribes of Jamshidi and Teimuri did pasture their flocks along the Murghab almost as far down as Ak-Tepeh, on the same parallel as Serakhs, but they have long since been driven to the south, and at present the Amir Abdur Rahman does not aim at establishing his authority further north than Bal6 Morgtiab, which is a stage south of Meruchak, as Meruchak is a stage south of Penj-deh. As lar south as Meruchak the Saryk Turcomans, who number at least 12,000 tents, are now undisputed masters of the valley of the Murghab, and t hey would assuredly be little disposed either to submit to the Afghans, or to migrate to other pastures, merely because an Anglo-Russian Commissioner bad drawn an arbitrary territorial line across the desert to the north of their2 present settlements. Further to the east again similar difficulties may be anticipated. The Ersari Turcomans are even less amenable to control than the Saryks, and as they are supposed to number some 40,000 tents, it would be idle to talk of annexing them against their will, either in whole or in part, to the Afghan monarchy. It must also be remembered that the Afghan border States between the Murghab and the Oxus are themselves at present in a very uncertain state of dependency. The Wali of Mymeneh will not admit Afghan troops to garrison his citadel, and shows little deference to the Amirâ€™s authority. The sympathies indeed of the three Uzbeg Chiefships of Mymeneh, Shibberg&amp;n, and Andkhoi, which occupy the interval between the Murgh&amp;b and the Oxus, are with Bokhara rather than with Cabul, and their co-operation, therefore, is hardly to be expected in any scheme which would tend to define and consolidate this portion of the Afghan frontier. Under such circumstances it seems hardly possible that a Survey Commission, even though sanctioned and supported by the Amir of Cabul, should be able to pass along the skirts of the hills from Khoja Saleh on the Oxus to Meruchak cm the Murghab with any practical or per manent results. The Anglo-Bussian Commission, wffiich undertook, 40 years ago, to delimitate the Turco-Persian frontier, has not yet succeeded in con trolling the movements of the migratory tribes across the border, nor in practically settling the claims to disputed districts; and in the same wav it may safely be predicted that whatever arrangement may be arrived at on paper between the Russian and the British Governments, the Turcoman and Afghan tribes will still intermingle upon the border, and the official territorial frontier, even though defined by artificial landmarks, will remain a dead letter in the country. The most reasonable, then, and the least expensive way of meeting the present requirement would seem to be to proclaim generallv that the desert belongs to the Turcomans, and the hills, as far as their extreme skirts, to the Afghans, three special points being named as determinants of the line of frontier, namely Serakhs (or perhaps Pul-i-Khatun) on the Heri-Rud, Meru chak on the Murghab, and Khoja Saleh on the Oxus. To attempt to connect these points by a continuous line laid down with scientific accuracy I look upon as hopeless ; and even were such a result to be attained, I should doubt its practical utility ; for under all ordinary circumstances nature would assert itself in spite of conventional barriers, and even in the extreme case of English and Russians eventually taking the place of Afghans and Turco mans, violations of frontier in an uninhabited and uninhabitable desert would scarcely require to be guarded against. The duty of the Commission would be, firstly, to decide whether the frontier line should leave the Heri-Rud at Serakhs or Pul-i-Khatun, and secondly, to determine the precise geographical position of the three leading points, on the Heri-Rud, the Murghdb, and the Oxus. A mere general declaration that the Afghan territory was to be limited to the north by the acknowledged boundaries of Badgheis/of Mymeneh of Shibbergdn, and of Andkhoi, would probably furnish a sufficient illus tration of the intermediate line of frontier. 27th August 1883.
