Although this part of the ooundary between Persia and Baluchistan has never been actually delimited I understand that the river shewn on the map as the Ladis river which later becomes the Mirjawa river, then the iahlab (see India and adjacent countries series No. 30 square B 4) has always been accepted as the dividing line; and the Mirjawa fort is on our side of that river. Yhe spot where the station has oeen milt is as the map I lave referred to very clearly shows- some four or five miles on the Persian side of this river bed.,4 r Hardinge, dated the 14th May Telegram from Sir Arthur 1905.

Bhotiov 2 . No. 1 . Sir A. Hardinge to the Marquess of Lansdowne.—{Received June 5.) (No. 102.) My Lord, Tehran, May 15, 1905. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith, in continuation of my telegram No. 65 of the 13th instant, a cojjy of the Agreement which I signed that day with the Mushir-ed-Dowleh, respecting the frontier at Mirjawar and the supply of provisions from Mirjawar, Ladis, and Seistan to the British outposts in North-Western Baluchistan. The Article about the frontier is very brief. I had, in my original draft, inserted boundary claimed by Persia,” hut, as the Mushir-ed-Dowleh said the Shah did not know exactly where Padaha was, and had made no claim in relation to it, I thought it advisable, in view of the uncertainty of our own right to it, not to draw too much attention to this point. I contented myself, therefore, with a recognition of our possession of it, and with the insertion of the provision—on which stress is 1 'in the Viceroy’s telegram of the 27th February—that the question of the frontier x. Mb at region should now be deemed settled, and no further claim be made respecting P. The clause about our garrison at Padaha using “ buckets or waterskins ” to draw water from the tank at Mirjawar is, I need hardly say, of Persian origin. The object of the Persian Government seems to have been to prevent our trying to claim a right to bring water by means of a “kanat,” or artificial channel, from Mirjawar to Padaha. I accepted it to please the Persians, though it reads rather grotesquely in a solemn diplomatic instrument. The total annual amount of grain obtained by me for our Indian frontier stations is, as your Lordship will observe, 2,200 Tabreez “ kharwars,” or 200 more than the figure suggested by Colonel MacMahon if it should prove impossible to persuade the Persian Government to remove the embargo altogether. I made great efforts in this direction, and induced M. Naus to speak very strongly to the Ain-ed-Dowleh in support of my representations, hut his Highness, though he relented a little and admitted that M. Naus was right in principle, said the embargo was an asset in the hands of the Persian Government, and should not he lightly given away. The concluding passage about customs duties and the non-export of grain from localities actually suffering from famine was insisted on by the Persians, but I insisted, on my side, on its being made clear that the harvest must he shown not merely to be threatened by inadequate rain, hut to have been actually destroyed by locusts, blight, or some other exceptional visitation (such as a raid, a flood, or some such abnormal phenomenon), since otherwise the Governors would always pretend that there was a scarcity, so as to get the embargo put on and make money out of bribes paid to them by smugglers. I pointed out, and the Mushir-ed-Dowleh quite agreed, that these illicit gains by the local Governors were of no benefit to the Persian Government, and that it was high time to put a stop to them. I told his Excellency, at the same time, that the additions proposed by him in consequence of orders received from the Shah’s camp about customs and destruction of the crops, had not been submitted to your Lordship, and that though I thought you would accept them, I must make a formal reservation which would enable you, should you not approve of them, to withhold your assent to the arrangement in its present form, and I handed to him, before signing the Agree ment, the note of which I have the honour to inclose a copy herewith I should mention that we had arrived at a complete understanding on the 7th instant, the day on which the Shah left Tehran, and I was ready to sign next day, but the Mushir-ed-Dowdeh insisted on sending the text of the Agreement to the Boyal camp at Kerej for the Shah’s approval, and as the Court was on the move, it was not till the 13th instant that his Excellency was able to obtain an answer to a telegram which I had pressed him to dispatch on the subject. Meanwhile, Colonel MacMahon had telegraphed that he wanted to start not later than the 15th instant, and 1 therefore thought myself justified, in view of your a clause defining the position of Padaha as “ situated on the Indian side of the [2030 e—2]2 ‘ Lordship’s orders to me, to make the best terms I could on the lines of the Viceroy’s proposals, to close with the Persian offers without further delay, especially as I had succeeded in obtaining a much larger export than was originally agreed to. I trust that, under these circumstances, my action will bo approved of by your Lordship. The Persian Government have asked me to supply them with a map illustrating the Mirjawar frontier as at present settled, and showing Mirjawar, Padaha, and the watering-places mentioned in the Agreement. I have telegraphed for one to Colonel MacMahon. The Mushir-ed-Dowleh also inquired whether a formal exchange of ratifications of the Agreement between the Shah and King-Emperor was in my opinion necessary. I have replied that as it was merely supplementary to the Holdich Agreement, I thought that this formality would probably not be essential, but that I would refer the point to yoUr Lordship. I should be grateful for your instructions on the subject. 1 have been desirous of incorporating in some form or other as part of a general settlement of outstanding questions on the Seistan and Baluchistan frontiers, a provision cancelling the prohibition of the acquisition of “ Kholasajat ” or State land in Seistan by British subjects, which was discussed in Mr. Grant Duff’s despatch to be Government of India on the 15th October last, and respecting which the Govern ment of India had desired me to make representations. I had accordingly raised the question in the note to the Persian Government of the 8 th ultimo, of which I had the honour to forward a copy in my despatch to your Lordship of the 18th ultimo. The Mushir-ed-Dowleh, however, asked me not to press the point at the present juncture. He said that a similar prohibition had been enforced in the Province of Astrabad, and that the Persian Government were now trying, in connection with the presence of our Boundary Commission in Seistan, to induce the Russian Government to withdraw the Russian Commission and escort from Gumbad-i-Kaboos, and to substitute for the peiraanent residence there of a Russian Commissioner a system of meetings at stated intervals between the Russian and Persian frontier authorities, similar to those which ha\e been instituted during the last few years for the settlement of border questions between the Nazim of British Mekran and the Governor of Persian Baluchistan. He adoed, somewhat to my surprise, that the Russian Minister has shown a disposition to tall m witu the proposal, and that the Persian Government hoped to arrange for buying back the buildings erected by the Russians at Gumbad-i-Kaboos, and was in the meantime trying to stop .any fresh acquisition of land or sites by the Russians in that district. 1 rather doubt any early agreement being arrived at on this subject, especiaby now that Colonel MacMahon is leaving Seistan, but I think it quite likely that the hints which 1 have sometimes dropped to the effect that we might reasonably ask lor a Frontier Commission in Persian Baluchistan similar to the one at Gumbad-i- Kaboos have been used by the Persians as a lever for obtaining the withdrawal of the latter. I have, therefore, said that I would await the result of these negotiations before raising the question of our right under our Treaties to claim permission for our subjects m fceistan to acquire State lands for building sites or shops. ~ I have, &amp;c.

HIS Excellency the Mushir-ed-Dowleh, Minister for Foreign Affairs of His Majesty the Shah of Persia, and Sir A. Hardinge, K.C.B., His Britannic Majesty’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at Tehran, duly authorized thereto by their respective Governments have concluded the following Agreement:— 1 . His Britannic Majesty’s Government withdraw the claim to the ownership of Mirjawar. put forward on its behalf in the year 1902, when a Persian custom-house was first established at that place. The Persian Government on its side undertakes to permit the British outpost at Padaha to procure (using buckets or waterskins for the purpose) the supply of water which may be necessary for it from the wells or tank situated at or near Mirjawar. 2. The two Governments agree by common consent to abandon the further examination by a Special Commission of their frontier line in this region which was proposed on behalf of His Britannic Majesty’s Government in Sir A. Hardinge’s note to the Mushir-ed-Dowleh, dated the 6 th April, 1902, and accepted by his Excellency in his note to Sir A. Hardinge of the 14th May, 1902. This frontier shall be definitely settled in accordance with the Agreement of 1896, and no further claim shall be made in respect of it. 3. With a view to the increase of friendly relations the Persian Government will permit the inhabitants of the frontier villages of Mirjawar, Ladis, and Duzdab to sell supplies, should they be willing to do so (to the annual amount of 700 Tabreez kharwars of grain), to the neighbouring British outposts on the Indian side of the frontier, and will also allow the unrestricted export of 1,500 Tabreez kharwars of grain and 50 Tabreez kharwars of ghee annually from Seistan for the use of the British frontier station of Robat Killah and other stations along the Nushki route. All the exports of grain and ghee will be liable to the payment of the customs duty levied on those of the most favoured nation. It is understood that this provision applies to normal years, and that the British Government will not demand the specified export ol grain from one of the localities mentioned when such locality can be clearly shown to be suffering from actual famine owing to destruction of its crops by locusts, blight, or other exceptional visitation.

We consider that the terms in respect of export of supplies are, on the whole, as satisfactory as could have been obtained, without indefinitely prolonging the stay in Seistan of Colonel McMahon s escort, the withdiawal or relief of which had become a matter of urgency. We should have preferred to obtain recognition of the boundary between Mirjawa and Koh-i- 1904; but we recognise the difficulties which Sir A. Hardinge would have experienced in pressing this on the Persian Government, and we trust that the decision to observe the status quo and abandon the idea of further demarcation will not result in future inconvenience.

I have the honour to forward the attached Memorandum on the Perso- Baluch Boundary question. 2. A copy, with map, is being forwarded direct to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, and should reach him about the 28th instant. 3. I anticipate that the demarcation of the Seistan boundary will be completed early in December, and that, unless unforeseen difficulties occur, I will be able to deliver my award on the Seistan water question about the middle of December. 4. It is, therefore, desirable that I should be informed of the views of the Government of India on the Perso-Baluch Boundary question as soon after the middle of December as possible. [ Secret. ] Memorandum on the Perso-Baluch Boundary question—Mirjawa to Koh-i-Malik Siah. As there is some prospect of the settlement of this portion of the boundary soon being taken up, I consider it advisable to note briefly the principal salient features of the question, and offer certain suggestions as to its treatment. 2 . It is unnecessary to go into the details of the voluminous correspondence on this subject, which is cn record in the offices of the Government of India and the British Legation in Tehran. 3. The principal facts are briefly as follows When settling the Perso-Baluch boundary, Colonel Holdich based his infor» mation, as to the northern portion of that boundary, on a map which, as proved by subsequent investigations, in no way correctly represented the country under consideration. His boundary line was defined in his agreement in accordance • Govenm^t of Indi., North-We»t iw that map and a printed copy of Frontier, 4 nuies=i inch, sheet No. 14 s.-w., that map,* with the boundary line drawn dated November 1892, and sheet No. 14 N.-W., on signed hj both Commissioners, A. H. McMahon. was delivered to the Persian Commissioner t No. 77 of 23rd June 1896. paragraphs 45 and 46 of Colonel A. H. McMahon. Holdich’s final report.f It is important to remember this, and to note the position of the boundary line shown in this map, relative to places such as Lar Koh and Mirjawa. The tracing, which is attached to Colonel Holdich’s final report, is not his agreement map, as supposed by some. It was prepared after his return to India. None of the northern portion of the boundary was visited or surveyed by either the British or Persian Commissioners. 4. The Persian Commissioner proposed I So-called in Colonel HoidicVs agreement, £ 0 run the boundary line along the Talab X but I believe the proper name is Tahlab. « * 7 ,. 1 P , . , A. H. McMahon. river to Duzdap, and thence in a straight line to Koh-i-Malik Siah. 5. Colonel Holdich, very unfortunately, did not take advantage of that proposal, but selected, instead, a line further east, on the supposition that it secured “a strongly marked and almost impassable frontier” (vide paragraph 9 Of his Beport No. 35 of the 5th April 1896 and paragraph 41 of Report No. 77 of the 23rd June 1896). He considered that “no more perfect boundary than that afforded by mountains and river combined could be devised.” The inaccuracy of his information, and conclusions based thereon, is illustrated by the fact that the said mountains are in no respect impassable, and the river on which he relies is incorrectly named. No Mirjawa river appears to exist.I 1 6 . The English version of the boundary agreement of Colonel Holdich* Mission includes the following clauses :— From pillar 11 northwards the Talab river becomes the boundary to its junction with the Mirjawa river. From the point of junction it is carried by a straight line to the nearest point on the watershed of the Mirjawa range, which limits the drainage into the Mirjawa river on the north. Thence it follows the main watershed northwards to the highest point of the Kacha Koh. From the highest point of the Kacha Koh the line is carried straight to the highest point of the Kohd-Malik Siah. ,, 7. The Persian version of the above clauses, to which the British and Persian Commissioners attached their signatures, reads somewhat differently i.e tf as follows :— “ From pillar 11 to the north the Kud-i-Talab has been fixed as the boundary to the junction of the Kud-i-Mirjawa, and from that place, in a straight line to the nearest peak of the Mirjawa range which is the limit of all the drainage from the north, to the Rud-i-Mirjawa, and from that place from the top of the peak of the Kacha Koh being drawn from the direction of the north will run to the end of height of the point of Kacha Koh and from that place being drawn in a straight line it will run to the highest noint of the Koh-i-Malik Siah.” ^ 8 . The Persian definition of the boundary by itself is unintelligible; but we must remember that a signed map was given to the Persian Commissioner illustrating the boundary. 9. The English version is intelligible, if we assume that, as shown by the Agreement map, by the Mirjawa river the Bar-i-Ghiaban is meant. If there is any Mirjawa river at all, it would appear to be the stream that flows down from Ladis, and in that case the boundary line would take off on the west bank, of that river, and any attempt to reconcile its course onwards with the definition becomes hopeless. 10 . Assuming that by the Mirjawa river the Bar-i-Ghiaban was meant and that the junction of that river and the Talab river is the point where the Talab river first begins to be called by that name, there is no difficulty in trac ing a boundary line on the map in accordance with the English version of the boundary Agreement. 11 . It will simplify further explanations to draw this line forthwith in blue, on an accurate map,* i.e., Government of India North-West Trans-Frontier * I attach a copy of this map with the boundary ^ miles=:l inch, sheet No. 14 lines referred to in this Memorandum drawn N.-W., dated May 1902. This blue line A. H. McMahon ffom tke junction of the Mirjawa and lalab rivers, a point to be decided here after by local investigation on the spot, runs along the watershed from some point abreast of Mirjawa, as follows • P e ^ s and 5813, leaving Gurandi and Bug springs on the right. Thence, in a curved course to peak 6977, and onwards in a figure of S, leaving peak 7157 and the Mazawad and Bagh springs on the right, and Shorab Pass on the lelt, it passes through the Bagaiwad Pass to Peak 7033. Thence turnmg north-east, it runs to peak 7714, which is the highest peak of Kacha T* • here, according to the definition, the blue line of boundary runs straight to the highest point of the Koh-i-Malik Slab, i.e., peak 5392, on which boundary pillar No. 186 of the Baluch-Afghan boundary is erected. 12. From the highest peak of Kacha Koh, to near Mirjawa, the boundary hue, as thus drawn, calls for but little remark, and is unobjectionable in itself. Near Mirjawa, however, it presents difficulties, for the straight line from the junction ot the Mirjawa and Talab rivers “ to the nearest point of the water- s e ^ is very i e y to biing our Padaha post and well within Persian territory^ 1 eie is considerable danger of this being the case, vide paragraph 29 below. r 8 I- f'13. Erom the highest peak of the Kaoha Koh onwards, the boundary line, as above drawn, is open to serious objections— : ( 1 ) It runs too close to our post at Robat to be convenient. The fort and spring are only 423 yards within British territory. (2) It brings within Persian territory a valuable alternative route to Robat via Kacha and Bug Thanas and the Piran Spring. (3) It brings the boundary line inconveniently close to the trade route, and includes in Persia several neighbouring springs of water in the valleys running down to that route, which would afford facilities to raiders and robbers. (4) Moreover, it may some day be of great advantage to us to own these upper valleys, in order Jo furnish British Officers and officials, who may hereafter have to be stationed at Robat, with some place near at hand where they can temporarily escape from the heat and unhealtbiness of Robat in summer. 14. To continue the boundary line along the watershed of all the hills, north of Kacha Koh, draining eastwards into British territory, would necessi tate a line from peak 7033 (near Bagaiwad Pass) stretching far westwards to the crest of the Buzaf, Lakshak and Wawaila Ranges. This would bring the Persian routes from Seistan to Bampur, Ladis and Jalk, via Duzdap, within our territory and would naturally be strongly objected to by the Persians. 15. The line which gives us what we want, and does not interfere with the Persian routes, is as follows : i.e., from peak 7033 (near Bagaiwad Pass) along the main watershed to just beyond the Bandi Pass, and thence in straight lines, or along the crests of ridges between nullahs, to Mina Bazar and the highest peak of Lar Koh (peak 7766) and thence in a straight line to the highest peak of the Koh-i-Malik Siab. 16. This line, to distinguish it from the blue line of HoldiclPs boundary from Kacha Koh northwards, should, for facility of reference, be drawn in red, and I will allude to it hereafter as the red line. It will be seen that this red . t A* • • „ ™ __ Qr . line disposes of the objections attaching * I use tte word‘river as written on the map, , ,, S, ,. • i j ° but it must be remembered that the Kacha and to the blue line. It glVCS as a boundary Piran rivers are dry torrent beds with only no £ only the western and main watershed occasional springs, here and there, in their beds. o{ ^ Kacha river and itg affluents, but A. H. McMahon. the watershed also of the Piran river.* It leaves our Robat post 2,552 yards within our territory, instead of only 423 yards as in the case of the blue line. 17. If it be remembered that the whole tract of country through which these blue and red lines are drawn is absolutely barren and uninhabited, it would not appear unreasonable to ask Persia to consent to the slight rectifica tion of boundary involved by the adoption of the red line. 18. The question for consideration now, is how this rectification is to be effected. The idea is entertained in some quarters that I may he able to obtain from the Persian Commissioner an interpretation of the Holdich agreement favourable to us, and this is based on the supposition that the Yamin-i-Nizam is not adequately provided with accurate maps and information, and may be found amenable to argument when brought face to face with the hardships attending deferred negotiations in that desolate tract. I myself held these views at first, hut am now most thoroughly convinced that to base any hopes of success on the above supposition must only lead to disappointment. 19. I will naturally endeavour to make the most of the vagueness of the Persian version of the Perso-Baluch Boundary agreement, and the misuse of the name Mirjawa river and, by claiming more than we want, try and get the Yamin-i-Nizam to agree to the red line, but I entertain no hope of success. In the map given to the Persian Commissioner, Kacha Koh and Lar Koh are distinctly shown as separate ranges, and tbe Lar Koh is shewn thereon further within Persian territory than it really is. Moreover, the Yamin-i-Nizam, before my arrival in Seistan, was very carefully tutored by the Russian Consul in all that relates to this portion of the boundary.4 20 . The instructions given to the Yamin-i-Nizam [vide Sir Arthur Hardinge’s Despatch to Lord Lansdowne No. 72 of 20th May 1903, are so explicitly worded that it seems hopeless to expect him to take upon himself the responsibility of agreeing to any line more favourable to us than that of the Holdich Agreement and map. From what he has said from time to time on this subject, I know that he is afraid to depart, in any respect, from the letter of his instructions, and is fully determined to do nothing on his own responsibility. 21 . At the most, I can succeed in bringing about a deadlock and hanging up demarcation work until references are made to Tehran. Beyond that, all that I can reasonably be expected to achieve by local diplomacy is to o-et the Yamin-i-Nizam indirectly to support my proposals by reporting that their adoption is not injurious to Persia. The nature of the country from Koh-i- Malik ^ Siah to Mirjawa would render it very difficult for the Persian Commissioner to refer boundary questions in sufficient detail by telegram, and the interchange of letters and maps would probably be necessary. The time it will take, in winter, for letters to reach Tehran, and for replies to reach Mirjawa, will be two months or more, and it is open to question whether we should risk so much delay and expense. We may be able, with our large stock of supplies and transport, to maintain ourselves in that desolate country, but I feel sure the Persian Commissioner and his camp will not be able to do so, and this will mean his returning to Seistan out of reach of my influence, pending settlement of the question at Tehran. 22 . I cannot well discuss the Perso-Baluch boundary question with the Persian Commissioner at the present juncture, as I have persistently refused to discuss even the Seistan water question until demarcation work is over. Moreover, there is the risk of the Afghans becoming aware of such discussion, and jumping to the conclusion that we are trying to obtain what we want in the Mirjawa direction at the expense of Afghan interests in Seistan. Any suspicions of this nature might place the good faith and impartiality of our Seistan Arbitration in a doubtful light and should, therefore, be carefully prevented. ' ' ho p 23, ^ ave » I think, good grounds, apart from those stated in paragraph 13, for asking the Persian Government to consent to the trifling rectification of the frontier involved by the adoption of the red line— (1) Ihe terms of the agreement drawn up between the Governments regulating the manner in which the boundarv was to be settled have not been complied with by their Boundary Commissioners. Ihe careful survey of the region adjacent to the frontier prescribed in article 5, was not carried out, with the result that the present difficulty has arisen. ( 2 ) The Persian Commissioner, himself, proposed to fix the boundary a ong the Talab river to Duzdap; The boundary we now ask tor lies, throughout, well to the east of that line. 24. We might, with justice, go further than the above, and point out that articles 6 and 4 Ol the agreement also were not complied with. The boundarv A. H. McMahoit. the agreement, nor has any exchange of A. H. McMahoit. the agreement, nor has any exchange of25. It will probably be considered too late to lay stress, at this stage, on the objections stated in the above paragraph, but it is not too late to use the arguments as propounded in paragraphs 23 and 24. 26. Instead of this Mission proceeding to the Mirjawa border and remain* ing there for some indefinite period, pending references to Tehran, I would suggest that the small rectification of boundary proposed above be urged upon the Persian Government, forthwith, and that this Mission should, in order to avoid the difficulties and hardships of maintaining themselves in a barren uninhabited country, remain in Seistan, pending the settlement of the question. The Persian Government seems so anxious to see us depart from Seistan that, perhaps, they would^ willingly waive a point or two to expedite our departure. Actual demarcation itself, when once the course of the boundary line is settled, would take only a few days. 27. As for Mirjawa itself, its importance, strategically, has been fully dwelt upon by Major Showers in paragraph 41 of his report above quoted. This importance, as we know, has been thoroughly understood by the Eussian Government and, through them, is now fully appreciated by the Persian Government. Personally, I am inclined to think that the importance of the place has' been somewhat over-rated, although there is no denying the fact that it is a well watered place close to our trade route, which, under certain, 'but still remote, conditions, might be made of great inconvenience to us. It is situated on the best and easiest route . from Khorasan and Seistan to the Persian Gulf, but the strengthening of our Baluchistan border, and improved communications, would tend very largely to negative the value, in other hands, of a route passing so very close to our territory. The importance to ourselves, or others, of Mirjawa, very largely depends on the course of future events in Seistan. The more our position with regard to Seistan is strengthened, the leas and less important does Mirjawa become. 28. To obtain possession of it ourselves is a matter which obviously lies outside the scope of a local Demarcation Commission such as this, and is one which, if taken up at all, can only be arranged by direct negotiations, in Tehran, with the Persian Government. The analogy of Gumbad-i-Kaboos, and the surrender of Persian water rights to Russia at other points of the Russo- Persian border, would, afford a fair pretext for demanding some similar concession to us at Mirjawa, if such be desired. 29. I am not, however, called upon to discuss this question beyond so far as it concerns Padaha, where our new post has been built. Sufficient has been recorded by Major Showers of the topography of this tract to show fairly clearly that, in accordance with the definition and map of Colonel HoldiclPs agreement, our post at Padaha is in imminent danger of finding itself within Persian territory. In the printed and signed copy of the North-West Trans- Prontier, 1 inch = 4 miles, sheet No. 14 S.-W. of November 1892, which forms the official agreement map, it will be seen that the junction of the so- called Mirjawa and Talab rivers is shown some 7 miles south of Mirjawa. The boundary line shown on that map would bring the Padaha post some distance within Persian territory. I understand thht no suitable site exists in the neighbourhood to which our post could once more be removed and, even if it could, we may, I think, reasonably decline to add another to the many concessions which, unnecessarily or not as the case may be, have already been made by us in the matter of the Perso-Baluch boundary. 30. So much prominence has been given to Mirjawa and its neighbourhood, and Padaha has been so explicitly referred to in the instructions of the Persian Government to the Tamin-i-Nizam, that I foresee no possibility of making him agree to any boundary in this neighbourhood more favourable to us than that of the Holdich Agreement. Short of re-opening the whole question of the Perso-Balucb boundary, and demanding, on the strength of our recent surveys and enquiries, a rectification of the frontier which will give us Mirjawa in return for concessions made to Persia further south, the only course open to us appears to be to press for such slight rectification of Holdich’s boundary as may be found necessary to include the Padaha post within our territory. 2499 F. D.6 31. This request would, of course, be based on the same arguments as those suggested for the red boundary line, paragraphs 23 and 24 above. There is one slight disadvantage in urging this request prematurely, as there is a chance, although a very poor one, of my being able to prove that our Padaha post is outside the Persian line. The procedure I have suggested in paragraph 34 meets this difficulty. r 32. The concession, by sale or lease, of a small plot (say 1 square mile) of culturable land with water on the right bank of the Dar-i-Ghiaban—Talab river, for growing fodder and vegetables for the adjacent posts on our trade route has been stated to be very desirable. 33 . The procedure which I venture to urge should be adopted, is that the Persian Government should be pressed, forthwith, to agree to the slight recti fication of frontier required for the adoption of the red boundary line, and to send the Yamin-i-Nizam necessary authority to demarcate accordingly. In the meantime this Mission should remain in Seistan. 34 . If the above request does not include the necessary rectification of boundary at Padaha also, it should be so worded as not to preclude a further subsequent representation regarding the latter place, when I have, as I feel sure I will have, to refer the matter on arrival there. So little would then remain to finish up a long and weary business that not only would the Persian Commissioner be likely directly or indirectly to support my representations, but the Persian Government would, after giving in on the first point, be less likely to make a stand on the second and final one. 35. What appears to me to be a strong argument for tackling the Perso- Baluch boundary question with the Persian Government direct, at Tehran, forthwith, without waiting for this Mission to leave Seistan and arrive at an impasse in Mirjawa, is that, when the Seistan question is settled up and we are known to have embarked on that of the Perso-Baluch boundary, Hessian diplomacy at Tehran will doubtless be more wideawake and more actively directed than at' present towards thwarting our wishes in that direction. Sir Arthur Hardinge will know whether this argument carries weight, or not, and consequently whether it is better to include both the red line and Padaha in one representation, or take up the red line first, and await further reference before tackling Padaha. 36.

The case of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk appears to have reached a deadlock. I now find that both Mr. Grant Duff and Colonel McMahon have recently expressed an opinion that he is not a worthy object of solicitude; and if it were not for the Russian attitude about him, which was a cousequence of his action in the riots in 1903, we should not, in all probability, have committed ourselves to his support so* strongly.

The following telegram was sent to Colonel McMahon on 3rd January “ Your private letter of 12 th November arrived during my absence in England. “ I do not believe that we could ever induce the Persian Government to accept the red line. They would consult both the Russians and the Yamin- i-Nizam, and the result migh- be their insisting on blue line, which is probably worse than the status quo. My idea would be to suggest to them that, if they behaved well as regards Seistan affairs, i. e., settled the case of the Hashmat-ul- Mulk and grain export questions to our satisfaction, we should be prepared, as the fehah lound in the presence of the Mission a source of anxiety, to with draw it without exposing them and us to trouble and expense of a Miriawa delimitation by it. M e would leave them Mirjawa itself, keeping Padaha ouiselves, and tieating the intervening stream as the boundary, and erectin 0, a boundary pillar between Robat and Koh-i-Malik Siah to maGv the boundary on the road. M e should, howmver, ask for a definite agreement that we should be permitted to obtain supplies from Mirjawa and Duzdab. “If you tell them that the rectification proposed is insignificant, they will reply { why then do you attach importance to it’? It would be injudicious to admit weakness of our case, and, on the other hand, to try to deceive, wmuld end m failure and increase their suspicions of us. ,, ^ am wr ^i n o i n sense to India, but would be glad of a telegram from you . Th 6 following telegram arrived from Colonel McMahon on 6 th January January 6 th Your telegram, 3rd January. Failing red line, I concur in thinking that the status quo would be preferable, from our point of view than the blue Ime, but do not Persians already recognise this, and would not our willingness to forego demarcation be considered to be an admission of weakness “ I have a suspicion that the Persians will not readily agree to defer demarca- “i NL^ V Lf\ n *! d bene . fit fTOm *&gt;. and 1 also expect that the Tamin- 1 -Nizam has been given orders to take advantage of our going to Mirjawa to settle Persian accounts with the Sarhadis, &amp;c., of those parts” “Jf “nfine ourselves to attempt to wriggle out of Holdich’s definition of northern portion of the boundary line, our case is a very weak one, but is it noti a fairlv strong one if open case with threat of general attack on whole lerso Baluch boundary settlement, on line of argument suggested in paragraphs 23 and 24 of my memorandum, and thus make them willing to accept slight rectification required as the lesser of two evils ? The rectification is insignificant, if the value to Persia of the small barren uninhabited track m question is considered, but the adaptation effected thereby of the paper boundary line, as laid down m Holdich’s inaccurate map, to the existing country, to suit requirements ot a lasting and workable boundary line, might he argued to he important to Persians as well as ourselves. Should it be necessary to ask for any agreement, such as you suggest, at the time of demarcation of the line, it should include permission forPadaha post to draw water from Mirjawa as hitherto. Little or no supplies are obtainable in Mirjawa, and supplies are mostly drawn from Ladis. My letter to Grant JDuff, dated 6 th December, regarding the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, indicates some of the risks involved if the Mission^is deprived of its privileged diplomatic character. If we are used as a lever to help on the settlement of the questions you suggest, which are outside the original purpose of Mission, would not the resulting difficulty and anomalv of our position here give the Amir serious trouble ? Might 1 suggest your telegraphing your views regarding Mirjawa question to India instead ot writing, for, as already explained in my telegram No. 871 of 3rd January, I would like to defer my water award, if possible, until we are m a position to leave Seistan”. following sent to Colonel McMahon, 9th January Begins. Your telegram I have sent to India my telegram of 3rd January and your s ot bth January. I do not think the willingness to forego demarcati m need suggest that our case is weak, if we get a good quid pro quo. We might put it, not as abandonment of demarcation, but as abandonment of our right to reopon boundary question on lines suggested in paragraphs 23 and 24 of your memo randum : and if then we find that they do not bite, adopt the method you suggest. I do not think there can be any chance of the status of your Mission being questioned as long as the Mirjawa boundary, which is one of its purposes, remains unsettled The Persians suspected that we intend to make it permanent, and I dropped a hint, by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs’s permission, that some such guarantee of Eussian moderation in Ashkabad might be asked by us as alternative to the re-instatement of Hashmat. .

Hardinge, K.C.B., K.C.M.G., His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta. Please refer to your telegram No. 194 P., dated the 13th January 1905. If, after receipt of my despatch of 6 th January, you still desire me to press for the boundary marked by the red line, I will do my best to obtain its adoption by the Persian Government, hut the great difficulty will, in my opinion, be that the Russians will insist that it involves a real rectification of frontier to our advantage, and will consequently claim an equivalent on the northern frontier. Addressed to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Depart ment ; and repeated to Colonel McMahon.23 Tehran, 6 th January 1905. No. 1. (Confidential.) Sir, I have the honour to submit herewith a copy of a telegram which I * ll 1 _ _ *1 _ X. i- ^ A. -i- y-v 1 ' 1 y-vl latest communications respecting the Mirjawa boundary, and more especially his demi-official letter to you of the 1st of November last, as to which my opinion is, I understand, desired by the Government of India. I had hoped before the departure of my messenger to-morrow to he in receipt of a reply from Colonel McMahon whom I had asked for his observa tions on this telegram, and it is possible that I may still receive one. I hardly think, however, that any fresh information which he may give me will sub stantially modify the view which I have expressed in the enclosed message. So far as J understand the situation, an exact delimitation of the frontier line laid down in the Holdich agreement will not only not strengthen our claim to Miriawa and Duzdab, both of which Captain Webb Ware believed he could include within our territory, hut will give us a line—the blue line of Colonel McMahon’s map—which would he less satisfactory than the supposed present one, inasmuch as it will, amongst other things, bring the Persian frontier to~Ihe very doors of our fort at Eobat Killa, and perhaps to a point east of our present post at Padaha. Colonel McMahon proposes, in lieu of it, a line marked in red on his imp which he does not believe he could induce his Pers.an colleague, the Yamin-i-Nizam, to recommend to the Persian Government, but which, he thinks, I might perhaps persuade the Ain-ed-Dowleh to accept. There are two ways by which I might, I presume, try to carry my point. I mio-ht contend that the red line was the one really in harmony with the intentions of the Holdich agreement, and trust to the ignorance and indifference of the Persian Ministers. Or I might approach the latter in a more straight forward fashion; point out that the text of the agreement did not correspond with the known intention of the Commissioners, and ask them to agree to the red line on the ground that the rectification involved in it, though of no conse- /&gt;To Colonel McMahon. 1st January. addressed on the 1 st instant to Colonel McMahon embodying my views on his— ' , * 1 ' 1 16 quence to Persia, would afford a more satisfactory frontier, would promote (mod relations between the two neighbouring- Governments, and might even be purchased on our side by some small pecuniary payment, or by a corresponding rectification in Persia s tavour further south. * ^ ° * •, The „ a , do P ti&lt; ? n of the first course would, I believe, almost eertainlv end in failure, ihe Am-ed-Uowleh would reply that he wruld refer the whole question for Ins opinion to his local expert, the Yamin-i-Nizam ; he would probably, or if he did not the Mushir-ed-Dowleh would, ask the opinion of the Eussians and both the Yamin and the Russians would doubtless expose and exaggerate the weakness of our case, and make the most of what they would represent as a perfidious attempt on our part to filch valuable land from Persia by misrepresentation. The net result would be to make the Persians regard the acquisition of the blue line, or of something equivalent to it, as a matter of vital importance to their interests, and to increase their already existing susui- cions of our designs on Persian Baluchistan. ° ^ The second course would be fraught with less danger to our interests but would hardly help us to realise the objects desired. Tor disguise it as we might we should be, m fact, asking Persia to cede to us a portion of territory which* however worthless and insignificant in itself, and whatever the original inten tions of the two Governments as distinct from the text of the agreement can be proved to be de jure a part of the Shah’s Dominions. “ If this rectifica- 1011 is of ^ no importance”, I should be asked, “ why do you wish for it ? There is surely m that case no real need to revise the Holdich line or to brino* the text o he agreement into harmony with the assumed, but unproved, intentions of its authors . I should be told that it was out of the question for the Shah to ahenate, m the phrase with which he has already familiarised us, “ one snan of his territory”, and that even if he were willing to do this, the certainty of a counter claim by Russia for an equivalent would make it impossible. It might of course be feasible to obtain what we want by a corresponding transfer of territory to Persia, further south, but I do not think it wo P uld be° an easy matter to arrange. m n ° n * tlie Per sian Government is not keenly desirous of ex^eTo ^dfvexnP^ Siah -¥ i . r i awa j J0 ^ da ry question ; to do so will mean expense to itself, vexatious enquiries, and threats of counter claims by Russia aLd the maintenance of the McMahon Commission, with what the Shah ' J e ' ar&lt; s as the s'mster possibilities attaching to the presence of its armed escort for some men hs linger in Persian territory. It is questionable whether the fhern a Ml ^ Iste .f know or su fP ect tbat a more careful demarcation would give them any territory over which they do not now exercise anthllt, “mu Russians, I believe, told Mons. Naus, at the time of the Mirjawa incident that not only Mirjawa but probably also Robat belonged by rights to Persia but I doubt if the Persian Government would spontaneously have ev“sed or tn v n n 0 ^, ra , I f’ * be fi uestl °n of a demarcation of the entire line from pillar 11 frontr wHh a ibke a v'f ^ ha T e A ac fi-—d for years past in an infinite lontier with lurkey, from Mount Ararat to the Shat-el-Arab, and thev would he quite content with an approximate boundary on the side of India so lon^ the'fpttp 0 ^ ? ropo , sed that the y sh ould make a formal cession of land which if bv probable 1 If? a S reeme “‘ a ^eir own.

Nor have I sufficient knowledge oflocal conditions to say whether the places marked in Colonel McMahon’s map as Bug Thana, Bedi Spring, and Piran Ziarat, and shown to be on the Persian side of the blue line are, de facto^ held or claimed by us. If they are, how ever, their occupation by us will probably be left unchallenged by the Persians unless the whole question is re-opened. As regards Robat, it could perhaps be arranged locally, at some later date, when the talk about the revision and real meaning of the Holdich agreement has subsided, to erect a boundary pillar at some point on the road from Hurmak not too close to our Thana, say, a mile or half a mile from it, in order to indicate for the benefit of travellers, and for the settlement of any uncertainties as to jurisdiction, the exact point on the trade route at which the two territories meet. This arrangement would be made as a matter of mutual convenience, and without reference to a line only verifiable with difficulty, running from the Kacha Koh to Koh-i-Malik Siah. I might, however, state to the Persian Government that, in return for a formal abandonment of our claim to Mirjawa, i. e., the point occupied by the Custom House, and for the withdrawal of Colonel MeMahon without the re-opening of any further boundary disputes, we should ask for the definite settlement of certain questions in Seistan, such as that of the export of grain, and also for the permanent right to draw supplies and water from Mirjawa for our neighbouring outpost at Padaha. I could probably effect an agreement on these lines, including perhaps a right of free supply from Duzdab without the intervention of the Yamin-i-Nizam. Colonel Douglas, with whom I have discussed the subject, agrees with Colonel McMahon in holding that the whole Mirjawa-Robat boundary is mainly important in subordinate relation to Seistan, and that the acquisition of the red line would be valuable to us only in the event of the establishment, by Russia, of paramount influence in Seistan and Persian Baluchistan. Since I sent my telegram to Colonel McMahon, I have received a repetition of the one from the Government of India to Mr. Secretary Brodrick of the 3rd instant, in which it is suggested that a satisfactory settlement of the Mirjawa boundary might be effected as part of an arrangement which could comprise a withdrawal of our support of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk. As to this, I think that the two questions might be treated in connection with one another, but I fear that any formal cession of territory which the Persian Government could be per suaded, whether by its own officers or by the Russians, was demonstrably its own, would be very difficult to obtain. An exchange might be possible, but a recti fication, however trifling, to the detriment, or apparent detriment, of Persia, would have practically no chance of success. Unless, therefore, we can make sure that the re-opening of the question will give us a more satisfactory line than the Holdich one, we had better adhere to the latter, inaccurate geographically as it is, rather than run the risk that further enquiry will involve the substitution of the blue line of Colonel McMahon’s latest map.

His Highness objected to (1) on the ground that he wished to unite Seistan and Kain into one province with a new Governor independent of Meshed and directly subject to Tehran. I suspect that the new Governor will be either the Yamin-i-Nizam or the Mustansir-ul-Mulk with the sons of the Shaukat and Hashmat as his deputies at Birjand and Nasratabad, respectively. will probably prefer as a separate Government. He agreed io principle to (2), but asked for details which I said I would supply on hearing from Your Lordship if you on your part accepted this compromise. At the same time I reminded him that my orders from you were to insist on the reinstatement of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk in Seistan. The latter would tal^Kain, but may not care so much about Tabas. I also understand that our local officers now regard both Yamin and Mustansir-ul-Mulk as friendly. On the other points mentioned in my telegram No. 32,1'lth Ma^ch, I am making by sustained pressure a little headway. He has asked me not to add to his difficulties during his present struggles with Russians, but has admitted that we have been forbearing.

Persian Government have made following verbal reply to my note of 8 th April, em bodying proposals as to Seistan and Mirjawa questions: (1) The abandonment of further delimitation is agreed to, and our posts • a t padaha and elsewhere may take water from Persian territory. (2) l he Persian Government agree in principle to the export of supplies for Robat and other British posts, but they wish a definite amount fixed, and are disposed to regard as excessive that which was suggested by Colonel McMahon as the yearly minimum, namely, 2,000 kharwars of grain and 80 of ghi. This point is still being discussed between us. (3) Acquisition of Crown lands by foreigners {vide Government of India despatch of 18th January). The Persian Government ask that this demand be postponed on the ground that they have enforced the prohibition in Asterabad province, whereas in Seistan most land is Crown. They are nego- tiaiino- with Russia for withdrawal of Gumbad-i-Kabus Commission, I suspect, bv saying we claimed similar rights in Seistan, and lor the repurchase of Russian buildings, and it is with this object that they profess to have issued the two prohibitions mentioned, which they hinted are only temporary. They have received a telegram from Yamin-i-Nizam to the effect that Colonel McMahon’s water award is very detrimental to Persian interests, and they are telegraphing to him for explanations. I have said that Colonel McMahon has not yet sent me copy, but that I will telegraph to him also, and hope to discuss the question with them in a day or two. I have a draft of Colonel McMahon’s award, but he does not want this to be known. They would wish him to remain in Seistan a short time longer until this issue is cleared up.

In view of difficulties which will arise, and other difficulties which the effect of my departure may have on those left, I would prefer to remain myself; but in recognition of the necessity for eliminating henceforth from Mission all elements of arbitration character, I would suggest Macpherson being placed in charge, either permanently or until fresh officer is appointed. By recalling supplies sent ahead, there will be sufficient for three and-a-half months’ consumption from now, but, after that, difficulties in purchase will doubtless arise. To meet the political, clerical, and accounts work, which supply and other questions involve, it would not be advisable to reduce the native political staff, except perhaps by one Native Attache. The survey and irrigation establishments could return. In any case, for reasons stated elsewhere, I would most strongly urge the immediate relief of both escort and civil staff.Enclosure No. 29.

I have just signed with Mushir-ed-Dowleh an agreement respecting Bunder Abbas telegraph extension and grain export to the Indian frontier. '1 he former is identical with that sent to the Poreign Office in my despatch No. 6 t, dated 29th March, plus provision for Persian Office at Henjam and English telegraphist for State messages at Bunder Abbas. Latter stipulates ( 1 ) withdrawal of our claim to Mirjawa and our right to obtain water from tank or wells at Mirjawa or near. ( 2 ) Abandonment by both Governments of proposed re-examination of boundary line in that region which is declared to be definitely settled, and respecting which no further claim will be made. (3) Permission to people of Duzdab, Ladis, and Mirjawa to sell- supplies to our frontier outposts up to 700 Tabriz Khar wars of grain a year, and unrestricted annual export from Seistan of 1,500 Tabriz Khar wars of grain and 50 of ghi for Robat post and Nushki road, that is, 2,200 Kharwars a year. Exports are liable to Custom duties levied on those of most-favoured-nation. Provision applies to all normal years, but will not be complied with from any locality which can be shown to be actually suffering from famine due to destruction of crops by locusts, blight, or other exceptional visitations. As McMahon was pressing to start on the 15th May, and you had told me to get the best terms I could, I signed, without referring to you, several details in which Persians had modified my original draft, but have put in a reservation enabling His Majesty’s Government, if it disapproves of these modifications, to withhold its assent from the arrangement.

The latter has given or promised large sums to the Vazir Darbar, to Sheikh Fazlullah, a Mujtehed, who has considerable influence with the Grand Vizier, and to other minor personages in the Royal Household ; and these substantial arguments, combined with the effects of the pressure exercised by me on theHashmat’s behalf, up to the receipt of your Lordship’s telegram No. 28 ot the 2drd ultimo, have procured his reinstatement in Seistan, and may possibly get 1 am for him as well. . . • i a- r I understand that he is offering to various exalted recipients—including, ol course, the Shah and the Grand Vizier, who will secure lion’s shares—a total sum ot about 20,000/., which, if the annual “maliat” of Seistan is, as estimated by the Mustansir-ul-Mulk roughly 25,000/. a-year (150,000 tomans) is not really an unreason able price. i r ii r • • x The present attitude, real or simulated, of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, m his inter course with the Persian Court and Ministers is anti-English, partly because he wishes to disprove the charges made against him by the Russians and his othei opponents of having sold Persian rights for English gold, and partly because he desires to discredit the boundary settlement made with Colonel MacMahon by the 1 amin-i-Nizam, whom he regards as his chief enemy and rival. In pursuance of this policy he has represented the boundary settlement to the Mushir-ed-I)owleh as most injurious to Persia, and if he returns to Seistan he will perhaps intrigue as much as he dares with the Russians, so long as the Yamin-i-Nizam remains on friendly terms with our officers. Should the Yamin for any reason develop Russian proclivities, the Hashmat-ul-Mulk will once more become strongly pro-English. On the whole, however, I venture to reiterate the expression of my belief that it will be best in our interests, as we have so far energetically supported him, .in deference to the views of the Government of In dia, that the Hashmat should return to Seistan. lie will probably now do so anyhow,'whether we give him further help or not, and we may as well get the credit of his restoration. It is for this reason that I have recommended in my telegram No. 52 of yesterday’s date our guaranteeing the further loan which he requires for the purposes of corruption in high places, so as [1979 q—S] Bto prevent his obtaining the money from the Russians, and going hack under their patronage and protection. As your Lordship is aware, I have never much believed in him, and the support which T have given him under your Lordship’s instructions, has been mainly due to the opinion impressed on the Government of India by successive British Consuls in Seistan that his deposition would be prejudicial to British interests. He has no real following in the country, no effective means of resisting, without active help from us, any anti-British measures which may be inspired from Tehran, and is treacherous, weak, and besotted by excessive indulgence in opium. When he does go back, the Mustansir-ul-Mulk and the Yamin-i-Nizam will, I expect, intrigue against him, and take much of his old power out of his hands; but for all this it will, I think, be to our advantage that we should be supposed to have assisted him, in recompense for his past services, such as they were, since the knowledge that we have done so may keep him—less from gratitude than from fear of altogether losing our good will—from taking an active part in Russian plots. If he shows signs of turning against us, we can, with the assistance of his powerful local enemies, who will, for reasons of their own, be only too ready to denounce him to the 8 hah, paralyze much of his ability for mischief. \ I have warned him that his son has been acting very unwisely in working with 1 the Karguzar against us. The Karguzar’s somewhat clumsy efforts have so far produced I no effect here. He recently sent a long telegram to the Mushir-ed-Dowleh, which, to prevent, as he supposed, Captain Macpherson from knowing it, he requested M. Molitor to transmit in Flemish through M. Nans, accusing the Yamin-i-Nizam of having betrayed his country’s interest to Colonel Macmahon, and imploring the Persian Government to withhold its assent from the latter’s settlement. The Mushir- ed-Dowleh treated this communication with contempt, and the Shah wrote a Minute on it to the effect that it was inspired by the Karguzar’s personal enmity to the Yamin-i-Nizam, and was the outcome of “fuzuli” (meddlesome intrigues). The Karguzar, of whose unfriendliness I have made repeated complaints, is now to be dismissed by the Persian Government, but his successor has not yet been selected out of several candidates for the post. I shall probably have to enter into some discussions and explanations with the Persian Ministers about Colonel Macmahon’s water award, to certain features of which the Yamin-i-Nizam has, as was only to be expected, raised objections. I do not trouble your Lordship with any remarks on this subject, as Colonel Macmahon’s very full telegrams to the Government of India respecting it will be in your posses sion before you receive this despatch. But I suspect the Shah will be so relieved at the termination of Colonel Macmahon’s Mission, and at the prospect of his early departure from Persian territory, that he will not be disposed to be unduly critical, or to protract by reopening the discussion, the Commissioner’s sojourn in Seistan, more especially as the attention of the Court is now entirely absorbed in the plans for, His Majesty’s impending Kuropean tour. At an interview which I had on the 15th instant with the Mnshir-ed-Dowleh, his Excellency expressed to me the Shah’s warm appreciation ol the labours of Colonel Macmahon and of the services which that, officer had rendered to Persia. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) ARTHUB H. HARDINGE. Inclosure in No. 1 . Sir A. Hardinge to the Grand Vizier. Your Highness, April 8 , 1905. I HAVE the honour to address you on certain points with reference to the rela tions between our respective Governments on the Indian frontier, which formed the subject of our interview of the 21st March last. Your Highness will recollect that the two principal questions which we discussed on that occasion were— 1 . The Governorship of Seistan ; and 2 . The disputed boundary in the neighbourhood of Mir j a war. These questions,* affecting as they do the relations of Persia with India, are connected with one another, and may therefore be treated together.As regards the first of them, the Governorship of Seistan I impressed on you the imnortance which His Majesty’s Government has long attached to the maintenance Hhat office of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, both because his local influence appeared to them a guarantee for the tranquillity of a frontier district m which India lias special interests^and because his removal, threatened by the Russian Consulate owing to ^ action taken bv him to suppress the anti-British disturbances of the summer of 1902 “ be Interpreted by the ignorant local population as implying an unfriendly feelino- on the part of the Persian Government towards ourselves Your Highness assured me, and I lost no time in transmitting this assurance to Lord Lansdowne, that any such interpretation of the action of the Persian Go\ i * ment in the matter of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk was entirely mistaken. Lou added that His Maiesty the Shah was contemplating certain new arrangements foi ministration of Seistan which would prove entirely satisfactory to Bntis interests hut that there were certain objections to the continued government o that province bv the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, whose capacities were not regarded as ejualto such a position. On my suggesting that a solution might possibly be found bv bestowing on the Hashmat-ul-Mulk the goveinmen foreign political rivalries were less acute, and thus showing that intereri^vou t 0 punish him for the assistance rendered at a critical moment to B - - ' observed that it was contemplated to separate both Earn and beistan lro m Khorassan and to place them under a Governor in direct dependence on 'L Q f brother of the late Shaukat-ul-Mulk as Deputy Governor of B ^ nd ’ “ d d tl ^ e S °^ 0 “ f the Hashmat-ul-Mulk as Deputy Governor at Nasratabaffi 7°“ to ever, that another Governorship would be bestowed on the Hashmat-ul-Mulk so as remove all idea that he had been deprived of his late post because ®“rl “ te d to the British Consulate, and that if he was not given Seistan he ^uld be appointed to Tabas, which has long been held by members of his family. I migln, you sai , regard it as a promise that lie would get either iaoas or Seistan. Lord Lansdowne to whom I telegraphed these assuran^s, and who is as your Highness is aware, deeply desirous of meeting as far us possible the view^^^^ of the Persian Government, has now authorized me to state that he wl l^or Hie present desist from further intervention in the matter of the Governorship oi Seistan. The representations which I was directed to make to you on this sublet were largely dictated by concern for the tranquillity of this important province, which apart from its proximity to India, borders on Afghanistan, and m which any ^ ew theTate with the Afghans may involve us under Article VI of the treaty of Ibo? with Shah. It must therefore be clearly understood by the Persian Government yh c has decided, notwithstanding our friendly representations, to introduce impor a administrative changes in Seistan, that the entire responsibility must rest with it lor any untoward consequences which may result from these new arrangements, and that no share in it can be assumed by His Majesty’s Government. , ,, With respect to the Mirjawar boundary, it may perhaps he useful thac Is u recapitulate as briefly as possible the main facts, with which your Highness told me at onr interview that you were unfamiliar, dating back, as they do, to a period antenor t0 ^TheHrontier between Persia and India was fixed in 1896 by an Agreement, of which, for convenience, 1 append a copy herewith. In 1901, Persian Customs pos s were established at various points along that line, and M. Cesari an officer ot the Customs Department, was sent to open one at Mirjawar. I he British district o e on onr side of the frontier contended that the spot selected by M. Cesan was within Indian, not Persian territory, on the ground that the latter had mistaken the streams, or rather nullahs, called the Talab and Mirjawar Bivers, and on the strength of this contention, proceeded to occupy the point in dispute himself. His action was unauthorized by the Government of India, and in deference to complaints made to me here by the Persian Government, he was ordered to withdraw to the opposite side ot the stream, which was maimed by Persia as the boundary, until such time as an investigation on the spot should have shown whether his interpretation ot the Boundary Agreement was in conformity, as he contended it to be, with the intentions ol the Commission by which the boundary was settled in 1896, and it was subsequently agreed that the question should he examined after the conclusion or his beistan Arbitration by Colonel Macmahon and a Persian Bepresentative, who would proceed for the purpose to Mirjawar. Meanwhile, the Persian Government have established a Customs post on the disposed ground without waiting for the inquiry agreed upon. [1979 q—8] B 24 Mirjawar is in itself a position of no importance to either Government. It consists, I believe, of a small settlement of Belli oh lints, often shifted by their owners; is not traversed by any important road, and has no trade. Its only value is that the villagers who cultivate its fields produce a yearly harvest, which, although it would be considered scanty in more favoured regions, makes it, like other small villages on the Persian side of the frontier, a centre from whence supplies can be drawn. The sur rounding country on both sides of the frontier line up to Kuh Malik Sink, where it terminates, is a torrid desert, so much so that at the time of the Agreement of 1896 it was found both a useless labour and expense, in view of the physical difficulties of demarcation, to mark it out on the ground itself, with the result that the correctness of the map annexed to the Agreement is now doubtful, and that a fresh survey and map may be necessary in order to bring it in harmony with the intentions of the two Governments. The reopening of the question of the ownership of Mirjawar, which i about 10 farsakhs south of Seistan, would most likely necessitate the postponement till next cold weather of the despatch of Colonel Macmahon to the spot, as the heat and want of water and supplies would render surveying operations there most difficult in the Beluch summer which is now close upon us, and might thus oblige the British Boundary Commission, which has already spent two years in Seistan, to remain there for a further period. This postponement of the Commissioner’s departure from the Persian frontier would cause additional expense to the Government of India, and would probably not be agreeable to His Majesty the Shah, who has several times intimated to me through your Highness bis desire that Colonel Macmahon and the force accom panying him should return to India as soon as their arbitration work was complete. It becomes, therefore, a matter for consideration whether a further inquiry on the spot into the ownership of the contested land at Mirjawar is worth all the trouble and expenditure of money which it would entail on both the Governments concerned. A solution of the question had occurred to me which I submitted to your l Highness at our interview on the 22nd ultimo, but which I could not then propose to you formally, as I could not say how far it would be agreed to bv mv Government. It was to the effect that we should abandon any further discussion as to the owner ship of Mirjawar, and that the land there now occupied by the Persians should be recognized as within Persian territory, whilst the Persian Government should enter | into an Agreement with us for enabling our few outposts on the English side of the | frontier to draw without restrictions, the supplies needed by them from the nearest Persian villages, and in the case of our post at Bobat Killeh, which, as situated , pn the Quetta trade route, is a somewhat important one, from Seistan itself. \ our Highness appeared to view this proposal with favour, or at least to deem it worthy of consideration, but asked for details as to the amount of supplies which we proposed to export from Seistan and Beluchistan for our outposts. These details I promised to procure for you as soon as I was able to ascertain from His Majesty’s Government that they were prepared in principle to treat on this basis. Lord Lansdowme, having now given me the necessary authority to do so, I write to inform your Highness that I should propose, in lieu of any reopening of the question of the frontier-line— I. The grant of permission by the Persian Government for the officer com manding the frontier post at Padaha on the English side of the so-called Mirjawar River, to obtain vrater on the Persian side, and for the outposts at Padaha, Saindak, and other places on our side of the line, to obtain freely and without restriction j such supplies of grain and other necessities as they can procure from the Persian | villages of Ladis, Mirjawar, Duzdab, and other small places betwuen Ladis and Kuh i Malik Siah. J. I he removal of the embargo on the export of grain from Seistau. The minimum amount of supplies wdiich is required every year for the wants of the garrison and posts along the Quetta trace route, so long as Quetta is not connected b) railway with the Persian frontier, is 2,000 Tabreez khalwars of grain per annum, and 80 or 100 kharwars of ghi, but the total abolition of the restriction would be preferable to the fixing of any definite amount. The only objection which could be made to this reform, namely, that it might, if the harvest were not as good as usual, be a strain on the resources of Seistan, is sufficiently refuted by the fact that the ocal Government alone have 11,000 kharwars of revenue grain per annum to dispose 0 ’ ^d often experience considerable dirficulty in disposing of it. The Persian o cials m Seistan have frequently admitted to our officers the advisability of removing t is prohibition, which, by limiting the amount of grain which can be sold, limits the amount giown, and thus diminishes cultivation, and with it also commerce and the5 i\% ^ &gt;•11 ; So ‘ Kfflamtlifif irei a, i es i: force Mi pry ob | boveriiBiel ms sloull If a tne a i, as sil revenues of the State. If, in connection with the settlement of Seistan and frontier affabs your Highness could relieve the people of Seistan from these restnc ions on their agriculture and trade, restrictions which, as you are aware, exist m no civihzecf 1 countrv except Persia, you would, besides encouraging commercial relations with India, confer upon these subjects of the Shah a boon of the greates ValU A third point which it would be desirable to adjust as part of a general settle ment of frontier affairs before the departure of His Majesty the Shah from Persia lor Europe, is that of the right of foreigners to acquire real property m Seistan m he same way as in other provinces of Persia. This right has been restricted oy a recent proclamation of which we have reasonable grounds to complain. It appears to us that whatever rights are allowed to Russian or Turkish subjects m the provinces bordering upon their respective countries, for instance, Ghilan, Azerbaijan, Kur distan, and Arabistan, should he equally allowed to British subjects m Seistan and Beluchistan which border upon India, and that any attempt to deprive them ot the equality of treatment which they enjoy under our Commercial Treaty, on the ground that the land in Seistan, most of which is desert, belongs to the State, and not to private owners, may be justly objected to by His Majesty’s Government as unfriendly. The Persian Government, which three years ago gave a Russian Road Company the rjo-ht to expropriate the owners of lands of all description in Azarbaijan all along the Julfa—Tabreez—Tehran road, and this notwithstanding the tact that such a procedure is not authorized by the religious law, cannot justly refuse to Indian traders the right of acquiring house property in Seistan for their business there. The one is a border province as well as the other. .. As it appears very desirable that an understanding on all these questions should be come to before the Shah’s departure, which I learn unofficially is to take place in the course of the present month, so that His Majesty may not be troubled during his journey in Europe by complications and difficulties on the Indian frontier, I would ask your Highness to give me in writing a reply to these various suggestions and proposals at your earliest convenience, so that the necessary instructions may be dispatched as soon as possible to the Representatives on the spot ol oui respective Governments.

My Lord Tehran, January 6, 1905.

I have, &amp;c. (Signed) ARTHUR H. HARDINGE. Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Sir A. Hardinge to Government of India. g* r Tehran, January 6, 1905. 1 HAVE the honour to submit herewith a copy of a telegram which I addressed on the 1st instant to Colonel MacMahon embodying my views on his latest communications respecting the Mirjawa boundary, and more especially his demi-official lettei to you of the 1st November last, as to which my opinion is I understand desired by the Government of India. I had hoped before the departure of my messenger to-morrow to be m receipt ot a reply from Colonel MacMahon, whom I bad asked for his observations on this telegram, and it is possible that 1 may still receive one. I hardly think, howeyei, that any hesh information which he may give me will substantially modify the view which I have expressed in the inclosed message. So far as I understand the situation, an exact delimitation ot the frontier line laid down in the Holdich Agreement will not only not strengthen our claim to Miijawa and Duzdab, both of which Captain Webb-Ware believed he could include within our territory, but will give us a line—the blue line of Colonel MacMahon’s map which would be less satisfactory than the supposed present one, inasmuch as it will, amongst other things, bring the Persian frontier to the very doors ot our fort at Robat Killa, and pei haps to a point east of our present post at Padaha. Colonel MacMahon proposes, in lieu 01 it, a line marked in red on his map, which he does not believe he could induce his lersian colleague, the Yamin-i-Nizam, to recommend to the Persian Government, but w hich he thinks I might perhaps persuade the Ain-ed-Dowleh to accept. . There are tw r o ways by which I might, I presume, try to carry my point. might contend that the red line w 7 as the one really in harmony with the intentions ot tne Holdich Agreement, and trust to the ignorance and indifference ol the 1 eisian .dmisteis. Or I might approach the latter in a more straightforward fashion; point out that the text of the Agreement did not correspond with the known intention ot the Commissionei s, and ask them to agree to the red line, on the ground that the rectification involvet in it though of no consequence to Persia, would afford a more satisfactory fiontiei, ^ou promote good relations between the two neighbouring Governments, and might even be purchased on our side by some small pecuniary payment, or by a corie»pon mg iccti cation in Persia’s favour further south. ,. .. The adoption of the first course wmuid, I believe, almost certainly eno in ailuie. The Ain-ed-Dowleh would reply that he wouid refer the whole question tor ins opinion to his local expert, the Yamin-i-Nizam. He would probably, or if he did not, ic USi u ' ed-Dowleh would, ask the opinion of the Russians ; and both the Y amm am t ie vussians would doubtless expose and exaggerate the weakness of our case, and ma/e tie oios • o what thev would represent as a perfidious attempt on our part to filch va uao.v, an 1 ^ )m Persia by misrepresentation. The net result would be to make the Peisians regai e acquisition of the blue line, or of something equivalent to n, as. a ma ei o vita importance to their interests, and to increase their already existing suspicions 0 our designs on Persian Baluchistan. [1822 d—T]The second course would be fraught with less danger to our interests, but would hardly help us to realise the objects desired. For disguise it as we might, we should be in fact, asking Persia to cede to us a portion of territory which, however worthless and insignificant in itself, and whatever the original intentions of the two Governments as distinct from the text of the Agreement, can be proved to be, de jure, a part of the Shah’s dominions. u If this rectification is of no importance,” I should be asked, &lt;£ whv do you wash for it ? There is surely in that case no real need to revise the Holdich line or to bring the text of the Agreement into harmony with the assumed but unproved intentions of its authors.” I should be told that it was out of the question for the Shah to alienate in the phrase with which he has already familiarised us, “ one span of his territory,” and that even if he were willing to do this, the certainty ot a counter-claim by Russia for an equivalent would make it impossible. It might, of course, be feasible to obtain what we want by a corresponding transfer of territory to Persia further south, but I do not think it would be an easy matter to arrange. On the other hand, the Persian Government is not keenly desirous of reopening the Kuh Malik Siah-Mirjawa boundary question. To do so will mean expense to itself vexatious inquiries and threats of counter-claims by Russia, and the maintenance of the MacMahon Commission with what the Shah regards as the sinister possibilities attaching to the presence of its armed escort for some months longer in Persian territory. It is questionable whether the Persian Ministers know or suspect that a more careful demarcation would give them any territory over which they do not now exercise authority The Russians, 1 believe, told M. Naus at the time of the Mirjawa incident that not only . Mirjawr but probably also Robat belonged by rights to Persia, but I doubt if the Persian Gov ernment would spontaneously have ever raised or would now raise the question of a demar cation of the entire line from Pillar II to Kuh Malik Siah. They have acquiesced for years past in an indefinite frontier with Turkey from Mount Ararat to the Shat-el-Arab and they would be quite content with an approximate boundary on the side of India so long as it was not proposed that they should make a formal cession of land which is' bv the letter of past agreements their own. It is therefore possible, and I think probable that if we were to say to them that in view of the length of time for which the MacMahon Mission has been in Persia, owing to causes beyond its own control, we were willing to drop the reopening of the question of the ‘ownership of Mirjawa, and to regard the so-called Mirjawa River as the boundary intended by the Holdich Agreement which would give the leisians, if I am not mistaken, the land now occupied by their Mirjawa Customs Station, and leave us the post on the other side of the brook or nulla at present known as Padaha, they would be content to regard the latter ps settled. 1 have ^qt been able to identify Padaha, to which, 1 understand^ Captain Webb-Ware shifted his camp by direction of the Government of India in the spring of 1902 , on anv of our mans loi whilst a confidential transfrontier map (Sheet No. 14 ) shows a place called k * Pad ha ” to the west of Mirjawa and therefore further than the latter on the Persian side of the frontier it can hardly be identical with an outpost on the east side of the Mirjawa stream or nulla. Nor have I a sufficient knowledge of local conditions to say whether the places marked in Colonel MacMahon s map as Bug Thana, Bedl Spring and Piran Ziarat, and shown to be on the Persian side of the blue line are, de facto, held or claimed bv us If they are however their occupation by us will probably he left unchallenged bv the Persians unless the whole question is reopened. As regards Robat, it can, perhaps, be arranged locally, ! at i50me , r date ’ when the talk about the revision and the real meaning of the Holdich agreement has subsided, to erect a boundary pillar at some point on the road from Hurmak, not too close to our Thana, say a mile or half a mile from it, in order to n \i he beneflt . of tra y ellers and the settlement of any uncertainties as to J s. iction, the exact point on the trade route at which the two territories meet. This n JC uf d r2f matter of mutual convenience, and without reference to a line only verifiable with difficulty from the Kacha Kup to Kuh Malik Siah. aRndnnm?^’ bowever k state . the Persian Government that in return for a formal abandonment of our claim to Mirjawa, i.e., the point occupied by the custom-house and d1Lutes W w h e d Ih Wa id 0f ?i Gn fl M i a&lt; f lah0n without the ^opening of any further boundary tha P t of ?ho f ' ' f ° r h6 i d ? dnlte settlement of certain questions in Seistan, such as from t0f § Tain a ^ d also for the permanent right to draw supplies and water A^empni nn tl° r T out P ost at Padaba. 1 could probably effect an the intervltron PS ’ 3 SUPP ‘ y fl '° m Uuad ' Ab with ° Ut M-cMalm^ e i’n^bnli?^ aS, +| W * tk i Wd0r u / j iave (dsc ussed the subject, agrees with Colonel subordinate ^ Mi H a wa-Robat boundary is mainly important in iclation to Seistan, and that the acquisition of the red line would be valuable3 to us onlv in the event of the establishment by R ussia of paramount influence in Seistan and Persian Beluchistan. Since I sent my telegram to Colonel Mac Mahon I have received a repetition of the one from the Government of India to Mr. Secretary Brodriek of the 3rd instant, in which it is suggested that a satisfactory settlement of the Mirjawa boundary might be effected as part of an arrangement which could comprise a withdrawal of our support of the Heshmat-ul-Mulk. As to this, I think that the two questions might be treated in connec tion with one another, but I fear that any formal cession of territory which the Persian Government could be persuaded, whether by its own officers or by the Russians, was demonstrably its own, would be very difficult to obtain. An exchange might be possible, but a rectification, however trifling, to the detriment, or apparent detriment, of Persia . would have practically no chance of success. Unless, therefore, we can make sore that the reopening of the question will give us a more satisfactory line than the Holdich one, we had better adhere to the latter, inaccurate geographically as it is, rather than run the risk that further inquiry will involve the substitution of the blue line of Colonel MacMahon’s latest map. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) ARTHUR H. HARDINGE. Inclosure 2 in No. 1 . Sir A. Harding e to Colonel Mac Mahon. (Telegraphic.) P. January 1, 1905. YOUR private letter of the 12 th November was received here during my absence on leave. I do not think it will be possible to induce the Persian Government to accept the red line. They would be almost certain to consult the Russians and the Yamin, and, as a result, might insist on the blue line, to which we would most likely prefer the status quo. I would like to suggest to them that if they treated us well in Seistan affairs, and offered us satisfactory settlements of the grain export and the Hashmat questions, &amp;c., we would be willing to withdraw- the M ission, whose presence is a cause of anxiety to the Shah, without incurring the trouble and expense, equally great for them and for us, of a Mirjawa delimitation. We would keep Padaha ourselves and leave them Mirjawa, making the intervening stream the boundary. To mark the frontier line on the road a pillar would be erected between Robat and Kuh Malik Siah. We should, however, require to draw- supplies from Mirjawa and Duzdab, and would ask for a definite Agreement on this point. If I tell the Persian Government that the rectification proposed is insignificant, they will ask why we attach to it so much importance. It would be injudicious to admit the v-eakness of our case, and any attempt to deceive them would end in failure and increase their suspicions of us. I am writing in this sense to India, but would be glad to learn your view T s by telegraph. «&lt;1 Telegram, No. 847, dated Seistan, the 30th November (despatched from Robat on 2 nd December) 1904.

Sufficient rain is reported to have fallen round Dalbandin and Chagai on the 12 th instant for Khushkaba cultivation. 3. On the 24th a telegram was received from Subadar Nur Muhammad, Thanadar of Mirjawa, to the effect that the Governor of Khwash visited Saindak on the 21st instant to send a telegram to Bam; that the Levy Thanadar of Saindak threatened to arrest him for entering British territory; and that he returned enraged to Mirjawa, where he burnt a quantity of bhoosa which had been bought and stored there for the use of the British Commissioner, Seistan Arbitration Commission. He also issued orders that the garrison of the British thana at Mirjawa should not be allowed to draw water from the stream which is the only water- supply at Mirjawa. Sqbadar Nur Muhammad in his telegram also states that, with great difficulty, he persuaded the Governor of Khwash not to bring this order into force for fifteen days. On receipt of Subadar Nur Muhammad’s telegram, I telegraphed to the British Commissioner in Seistan, asking him to arrange with the Persian officials that water shall not be prohibited to the garrison of the Mirjawa Thana. The question of the Persians attempting to prohibit water to the Mirjawa Thana is somewhat serious, as the stream in question, which is a mile from the British thana, is the only water-supply, and is stated by the Persians to be in Persian territory. In May last, a Persian Customs official visited Mirjawa, and objected to Subadar Nur Muhammad and his men taking water from the Mirjawa stream. I was myself at Saindak at the time as Assistant District Superintendent of Police, and reported the fact to Colonel McMahon, and asked him to arrange with the Yamin-i-Nizam that no questions of water should be raised until the Mir jawa boundary was settled. Colonel McMahon replied that he did not at that10 i i— time wish to raise any Mirjawa questions with the Yamin-i-Nizam ; and that, if the Per&gt;ians attempted to stop our levies from taking water from the stream he would tell the Yamin that the questions must rest until the boundary was settled. I have no doubt, therefore, that Colonel McMahon will he able to settle the present question. Subadar Nur Muhammad appears to have acted with tact in dealing with the Governor of Khwash, and in not attempting to prevent him burning the Commissioner’s bhoosa, which must have been burnt within sight of the thana and which might very naturally have led to an affray.

McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.E , British Commissioner, Seistan Arbitration Commission, for the week ending the 30th November 1904. 28th November 1904, Comp Reg-i-Mori.—I received a telegram yesterday from the Political Assistant, Chagai, reporting that theThanadar at Padaha had telegraphed, saying that the Governor of Khwash had gone to Saindak to despatch a telegram to Bam. The Thanadar of Saindak had apparently threatened to arrest him, whereupon he had returned to Mirjawa in great wrath, burnt nearly all the bhoosa which I had bought and collected there, and ordered that our Padaha post should no longer be allowed to take their drinking water from Mirjawa, and all trespassers into Mirjawa should be arrested. Hie Political Assistant, Chagai, requests me to settle this matter with the Persian authorities, as the only water available for our Padaha post lies a mile within what the Persians claim as their territory. A subsequent report to me direct from the Thanadar, Padaha, shows that he sent two sowars as escort with the Governor of Khwash to Saindak; but notwithstanding this, the Thanadar there threatened to arrest that officer. I sent Captain Ramsay to interview the Yamin, and tell him that I reserved action as regards the matter of bhoosa until I received fuller information; but, as regards water, &amp;c., he should order the Governor of Khwash to do nothing to interfere with the present status quo, pending our arrival in Mirjawa and the settlement of that frontier. The Yamin promptly wrote the necessary orders, and asked Captain Ramsay to have the letter sent by our post and delivered to the Governor of Khwash through our Thanadar at Padaha. 17 Extract from the diary of T.

Hardinge, K.C.B., K.C.M.G., His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, To—The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta. The following telegram was sent to Colonel McMahon on 3rd January:— “Your private letter of 12th November arrived during my absence in England. “ I do not believe that we could ever induce the Persian Government to accept the red line. They would consult both the Russians and the Yamin- i-Nizam, and the result might be their insisting on blue line, which is probably worse than the status quo. My idea would be to suggest to them that, if they behaved well as regards Seistan affairs i. e., settled the case of the Hashmat-ul- Mulk and grain export questions to our satisfaction, we should be prepared, as the Shah found in the presence of the Mission a source of anxiety, to with draw it without exposing them and us to trouble and expense of a Mirjawa delimitation by it. M e would leave them Mirjawa itself, keeping Padaha ourselves, and treating the intervening stream as the boundary, and erecting a boundary pillar between Robat and Koh-i-Malik Siah to mark the boundary on the road e should, however, ask for a definite agreement that we should be permitted to obtain supplies from Mirjawa and Duzdab. “ If you tell them that the rectification proposed is insignificant, they wil^ reply ‘ why then do you attach importance to it ’ ? It would be injudicious to admit weakness of our case, and, on the other hand, to try to deceive, would end in failure and increase their suspicions of us. I am writing in this sense to India, but would be glad of a telegram from Th«* following telegram arrived from Colonel McMahon on 6th January:— “ January 6th. Your telegram, 3rd January. Failing red line, I concur in thinking that the status quo would be preferable, from our point of view, than the blue line, but do not Persians already recognise this, and would not our willingness to forego demarcation be considered to be an admission of weakness of our &lt;-ase ? “ 1 have a suspicion that the Persians will not readily agree to defer demarca tion, as they have been led to expect benefit from it, and 1 also expect that the A amin-i-N izam has been given orders to take advantage of our going to Mirjawa to settle Persian accounts with the Sarhadis, &amp;c., of those parts. “ If we confine ourselves to attempt to wriggle out of Holdich’s definition of northern portion of the boundary line, our case is a very weak one, but is it nota fairly strong one if we open case with threat of general attack on whole Perso- Baluch boundary settlement, on line of argument suggested in paragraphs 23 and 24 of my memorandum, and thus-make them willing to accept slight rectification required as the lesser of two evils ? The rectification is insignificant, if the value to Persia of the small barren uninhabited track in question is considered, but the adaptation effected thereby of the paper boundary line, as laid down in Holdich’s inaccurate map, to the existing country, to suit requirements of a lasting and workable boundary line, might be argued to be important to Persians as well as ourselves. Should it be necessary to ask for any agreement, such as you suggest, at the time of demarcation of the line, it should include permission for Padaha post to draw water from Mirjawa as hitherto. Little or no supplies are obtainable in Mirjawa, and none still further. Duzdab food- supplies are mostly drawn from Ladis. My letter to Grant Duff, dated 6th December, regarding the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, indicates some of the risks involved, if the Mission is deprived of its privileged diplomatic character. If we are used as a lever to help on the settlement of the questions you suggest, which are outside the original purpose of Mission, would not the resulting difficulty and anomaly of our position here give the Amir serious trouble ? Might I suggest your telegraphing your views regarding Mirjawa question to India instead of writing, for, as already explained in my telegram No. 871 of 3rd January, I would like to defer my water award, if possible, until we are in a position to leave Seistan”. Following sent to Colonel McMahon, 9th January:— Begins. Your telegram. I have sent to India my telegram of 3rd January and your’s of 6th January. I do not think the willingness to forego demarcation need suggest that our case is weak, if we get a good quid pro quo. We might put it, not as abandonment of demarcation, but as abandonment of our right to reopon boundary question on lines suggested in paragraphs 23 and 24 of your memo randum ; and if then we find that they do not bite, adopt the method you suggest. I do not’think there can be any chance of the status of your Mission being questioned as long as the Mirjawa boundary, which is one of its purposes, remains unsettled. The Persians suspected that we intend to make it permanent, and I dropped a hint, by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs’s permission, that some such guarantee of Russian moderation in Ashkabad might be asked by us as alternative to the re-instatement of Hashmat. 20 Telegram, No. 194 F., dated the 13th January 1905.

As there is some prospect of the settlement of this portion of the boundary soon being taken up, I consider it advisable to note briefly the principal salient features of the question, and offer certain suggestions as to its treatment. 2. It is unnecessary to go into the details of the volumirouR correspondence on this subject, which is &lt; n record in the offices of the Government of India and the British Legation in Tehran. 3. The principal facts are briefly as follows When settling the Perso-Baluch boundary, Colonel Holdieh based his infor mation, as to the northern portion of that boundary, on a map which, as proved by subsequent investigations, in no way correctly represented the country under consideration. His boundary line was defined in his agreement in accordance with that map, and a printed copy of that map,* with the boundary line drawn on it, and signed by both Commissioners, was delivered to the Persian Commissioner — ride paragraphs 45 and 46 of Colonel Holdich’s final report.f It is important to remember this, and to note the position of the boundary line shown in this map, relative to places such as Lar Koh and Mirjawa. The tracing, which is attached to Colonel Holdich’s final report, is not his agreement map, as supposed by some. It was prepared after his return to India. .None of the nortbern P ortion of the boundary was visited or surveyed by either the British or ersian Commissioners. t sa.* h a • n i i tt , 3 . 4. The Persian Commissioner proposed but ibelieve the proper b *me]! TaiJab^ 6611161 ^ run the boundary line along the Talab l A. H. McMahon. river to Duzdap, and thence in a straight line to Koh-i-Malik Siah. 5. Colonel Holdich, very unfortunately, did not take advantage of that ^ proposal, but selected, instead, a line further east, on the supposition that it * / A ] secured “a strongly marked and almost impassable frontier” (vide paragraph f, ( yJ-1 7 ^ ij 8 7 ,e P° r ^ ^ () ' tbe 5th April lb96 and paragraph 41 of Report +L 0 ' 41 ^ urie 1896). He considered that “no more perfect boundary mountains and river combined could be devised.” The inaccuracy of his information, and conclusions based thereon, is illustrated by ie act that the said mountains are in no respect impassable, and the river on w neh he lelies is incorrectly named. No Miriawa river appears to exist. 2o04 F. D. ,1 * j.6. The English version of the boundary agreement of Colonel Holdich'a Mission includes the following clauses : — tt p rom pillar 11 northwards the Talab river becomes the boundary to its junction with the Mirjawa river. “ From the point of junction it is carried by a straight line to the nearest point on the watershed of‘the Mirjawa range, which limits the drainage into the Mirjawa river on the north. “Thence it follows the main watershed northwards to the highest point of the Kacha Koh. “ Erom the highest point of the Kacha Koh the line is carried straight to the highest point of the Koh i-Malik &amp;iah. 7. The Persian version of the above clauses, to which the British and Persian Commissioners attached their signatures, reads somewhat differently, i.e t , as follows : — “ Erom pillar 11 to the north the Ru 1-i-Talab has been fixed as the boundary to the junction of the Rud - i-Mirjawa, and from that place, in a straight line to the nearest peak of the Mirjawa range which is the limit of all the drainage from the north, to the Kud-i-Mirjawa, and from that place from the top of the peak of the Kacha Koh being drawn from the direction of the north will run to the end of height of the point of Kaoha Koh and from that place being drawn in a straight line it will run to the highest point of the Koh-i-Malik Siah.” 8. The Persian definition of the boundary by itself is unintelligible ; hut we must remember that a signed map was given to the Persian Commissioner illustrating the boundary. 9. The English version is intelligible, if we assume that, as shown by the Agreement map, by the Mirjawa river the Dar-i-Ghiaban is meant. If there is any Mirjawa river at all, it would appear to be the stream that flows down from Ladis, and in that case the boundary line would take off on the west bank of that river, and any attempt to reconcile its course onwards with the definition becomes hopeless. 10. Assuming that by the Mirjawa river the Dar-i-Ghiaban was meant, and that the junction of that river and the Talab river is the point where the Talab river first begins to be called by that name, there is no difficulty in trac ing a boundary line on the map in accordance with the English version of the boundary Agreement. 11. It will simplify further explanations to draw this line forthwith, in blue, on an accurate map,* i.e., Government of India North-West Trans-Erontier mT ,, , , map of 4 miles=l inch, sheet Np. 14 ihlVetotr to Py io fh'udtw' N.-W., dated May 1902. Thia blue line, thereon. from the junction of the Mirjawa and A. H. McMahok. Talab rivers, a point to be decided here after by local investigation on the spot, runs along the watershed from some point abreast of Mirjawa, as follows:— Through peaks 5998 and 5813, leaving Gurandi and Bug springs on the right. Thence, in a curved course to peak 6977, and onwards in a figure of S, leaving peak 7157 and the Mazawad and Bagh springs on the right, and Shorab Pass on the left, it passes through the Bagaiwad Pass to Peak 7033. Thence, turning north-east, it runs to peak 7714, which is the highest peak of Kacha Koh. Erom here, according to the definition, the blue line of boundary runs —— CAjVy'V/Vyj. l)\J LUC VlfTlJLLlJL UiAsUL) w a. v/^ ^ — straight to the highest point of the Koh-i-Malik Slab, i.e., peak 5392, on which boundary pillar No. 186 of the Baluch-Afghan boundary is erected. 12. Erom the highest peak of Kacha Koh, to near Mirjawa, the boundary line, as thus drawn, calls for but little remark, and is unobjectionable in itself. / Near Mirjawa, however, it presents difficulties, for the straiglit line from the junction of the Mirjawa and Talab rivers “ to the nearest point of the water shed ” is very likely to bring our Padaha post and well within Persian territory- There is considerable danger of this being the case, vide paragraph 29 below.13. From tho highost peak, of the Kacha Koh onwards, the boundary line, ] as above drawn, is open to serious objections— (1) It runs too close to our post at Robat to be convenient. The fort and spring are only 423 yards within British territory. (2) It brings within Persian territory a valuable alternative route to ! Robat via Kaclia and Bug Thanas and the Piran Spring. f (3) It brings the boundary line inconveniently close to the trade route, f and includes in Persia several neighbouring springs of water in ‘ the valleys running down to that route, which would afford facilities to raiders and robbers. (4) Moreover, it may some day be of great advantage to us to own these upper valleys, in order to furnish British Officers and officials, who may hereafter have to be stationed at Robat, with I s f d v here they can temporarily escape from | the heat and unhealthiness of Robat in summer. 14. To continue the boundary line along the watershed of all the hills, north of Kacha Koh, draining eastwards into British territory, would necessi tate a line from peak 7033 (near Bagaiwad Pass) stretching far westwards to the crest of the Buzaf, Lakshak and Wawaila Ranges. This would bring the Persian routes from Seistan to Bampur, Ladis and Jalk, via Duzdap, within our territory and would naturally be strongly objected to by the Persians. 15. The line which gives us what we want,.and does not interfere with the Persian routes, is as follows : i.e., from peak 7033 (near Bagaiwad Pass) along the main watershed to just beyond the Bandi Pass, and thence in straight lines, or along the crests of ridges between nullahs, to Mina Bazar and the highest peak of Lar Koh (peak 7766) and thence in a straight line to the highest peak of the Koh-i-Malik Siah. 16. This line, to distinguish it from the blue line of Holdich’s boundary from Kacha Koh northwards, should, for facility of reference, be drawn in red, and I will allude to it hereafter as the red line. It will be seen tl\at this red . 1 » the word 'river’ a. written on the map, line disposes of the objections attaching but it must be remembered that the Kacha and to tile blue line. It glVCS as a boundary Piran rivers are dry torrent beds with only D0 ^ on ]y western and main watershed ocoasional springs, here and there, m the.r beds. Qf ^ rivej , and its affluents, but A. H. McMahon. wa t e rshed also of the Piran river.* It leaves our Robat post 2,552 yards within our territory, instead of only 423 yards as in the case of the blue line. 17. If it be remembered that the whole tract of country through which these blue and red lines are drawn is absolutely barren and uninhabited, it would not appear unreasonable to ask Persia to consent to the slight rectifica tion of boundary involved by tlie adoption of the red line. 18. The question for consideration now, is how this rectification is to be effected. The idea is entertained in some quarters that I may be able to obtain from the Persian Commissioner an interpretation of the Iloldich agreement favourable to us, and this is based on the supposition that the Yamin-i-Nizam is not adequately provided with accurate maps and information, and may be found amenable to argument when brought face to face with the hardships attending deferred negotiations in that desolpte tract. I myself held these views at first, but am now most thoroughly convinced that to base any hopes of success on the above supposition must only lead to disappointment. 19. I will naturally endeavour to make the most of the vagueness of the Persian version of the Perso-Baluch Boundary agreement, and the misuse of the name Mirjawa river and, by claiming more than we want, try and get the Yamin-i*Nizam to agree to the red line, but I entertain no hope of success. In the map given to the Persian Commissioner, Kacha Koh and Lar Koh are distinctly shown as separate ranges, and the Lar Koh is shewn thereon further within Persian territory than it really is. Moreover, the Yamin-i-Nizam, before my arrival in Seistan, was very carefully tutored by the Russian Consul in all that relates to this portion of the boundary. f20. The instructions given to the Yamin-i-Nizam (vide Sir Arthur Hardinge’s Despatch to Lord Lansdowne No. 7*2 of 20th May 1903, are so ^ 1 ■* /ti 4-1 -rr /d o t' 1 I'! r\ a-irirxcxnT In nr» ▼•/a t - r» -»-wv 1 * _ i m explicitly worded that it seems hopeless to expect him to take upon himself the responsibility of agreeing to any line mnrp fnvonrnhlp +.n n« than ( , , more favourable to us than that of the Holdich Agreement and map. From what he has said from time to time on this subject, I know that he is afraid to depart, in any respect, from the letter of his instructions, and is fully determined to do nothing on hisown responsibility. ^ 21. At the most, I can succeed in bringing about a deadlock and hanging up demarcation work until references are made to Tehran. Heyond that all that I can reasonably be expected to achieve by local diplomacy is to o’et the Yamin-i-Nizam indirectly to support my proposals by reporting that their adoption is not injurious to Persia. The nature of the country from Koh-i- Malik Siah to Mirjawa w&lt; uld render it very difficult for the Persian Commissioner to refer boundary questions in sufficient detail by telegram, and the interchange of letters and maps would probably be necessary. The time it will take, in winter, for letters to reach Tehran, and for replies to reach Mirjawa, will be two months or more, and it is open to question whether we should risk so much delay and expense. We may be able, with our lar^e stock of supplies and transport, to maintain ourselves in that desolate country, but I feel sure the Persian Commissioner and his camp will not be able to do so, and this will mean his returning to Seistan out of reach of my influence pending settlement of the question at Tehian. 22. I cannot well dheuss • the Perso-Baluch boundary question with the Persian Commissioner at the present juncture, as I have persistently refused to discuss even the Seistan water question until demarcation work is over Moreover, there is the risk of the Afghans becoming aware of such discussion*, and jumping to the conclusion that we are timing to obtain what we want in the Mirjawa direction at the expense of Afghan interests in Seistan. Any Riisnininns r»f tViie nufnrn minrU* Ion., tUn , r rmA ^* the Mirjawa direction at the expense of Afghan interests in Seistan. Any suspicions of this nature might place the good faith and impartiality of our Seistan Arbitration in a doubtful light and should, therefore, be carefully prevented. * 23. We have, I think, good grounds, apart from those stated in paragraph 13, for asking the Persian Government to consent to the trifling rectification of the frontier involved by the adoption of the red line— (1) The terms of the agreement drawn up between the Governments regulating the manner in which the boundary was to be settled, have not been complied with by their Boundary Commissioners*. The careiul survey of the region adjacent to the frontier, prescribed in article 5, was not carried out, with the result that the present difficulty has arisen. (2) The Persian Commissioner, himself, proposed to fix the boundary along the lalab river to Duzdap. The boundary we now ask tor lies, throughout, well to the east of that line. . e might, with justice, go further than the above, and point out that articles 3 and 4 of the agreement also were not complied with. The boundary line subsequently laid down does not “ follow as closely* as possible the line shown in the sketch map attached M to the agreement, nor has any exchange of country been made to equalise in the , i . , « , . „ y,t ~ made to Persia. Moreover, the condition unc er w ueh Colonel Doldich surrendered the Gorani date groves to Persia, i.e., f Major Showers in his above report (paragraph 40) writes s “ A con- “ 0n Understanding t Damanis shmildhe V** wer ® a . bandoned ^ Persia was that the that the frontier Governors Oamams should be kept under ethcient control.

Instead of this Mission proceeding to the Mirjawa border and remain, mg there for some indefinite period, pending references to Tehran, I would suggest that the small rectification of boundary proposed above be urged upon the Persian Government, forthwith, and that this Mission should, inorderto avoid the difficulties and hardships of maintaining themselves in a barren uninhabited country, remain in Seistan, pending the settlement of the question. The Persian Government seems so anxious to see us depart from Seistan that, ' perhaps, they would willingly waive a point or two to expedite our departure. Actual demarcation itself, when once the course of the boundary line is settled, would take only a few days. 27. As for Mirjawa itself, its importance, strategically, has been fully dwelt upon by Major Showers in paragraph 41 of his report above quoted This importance, as we know, has been thoroughly understood by the Eussian Government and, through them, is now fully appreciated by the Persian Government. Personally, I am inclined to think that the importance of the place has been somewhat over-rated, although there is no denying the fact that it is a well watered place close to our traue route, which, under certain, but still remote, conditions, might oe made of great inconvenience to us. It is situated on the best and easiest route from Khorasan and Seistan to the Persian Gulf, but the strengthening of our Baluchistan border, and improved communications, would tend very largely to negative the value, in other hands, of a route passing so very close to our territory. The importance tq ourselves, or others, of Mirjawa, very largely depends on the course of future events in Seistan. The more our position with regard to Seistan is strengthened,- the less and less important does Mirjawa become. 28. To obtain possession of it ourselves is a matter which obviously lies outside the scope of a local Demarcation Commission such as this, and is one which, if taken up at all, can only be arranged by direct negotiations, in Tehran, with the Persian Government. The analogy of Gumbad-i-Kaboos, and the surrender of Persian water rights to Russia at other points of the Russo- Persian border, would, facie, afford a fair pretext for demanding some similar concession to us at Mirjawa, if such be desired. 29. I am not, however, called upon to discuss this question beyond so far as it concerns Padaba, where our new post has been built. Sufficient has been recorded by Major Snow r ers of the topography of this tract to show fairly clearly that, in accordance with the definition and map of Colonel Holdich’s agreement, our post at Padaha is in imminent danger of finding itself within Persian territory. In the printed and signed copy of the North-West Trans- Frontier, 1 inch = 4 miles, sheet N T o. 14 S.-W. of November 1892, which . forms the official agreement map, it will be seen that the junction of the so- I called Mirjawa and Talab rivers is shown some 7 miles south of Mirjawa. I The boundary line shown on that map would bring the Padaha post some distance within Persian territory. I understand that no suitable site exists in the neighbourhood to w hich our post could once more be removed and, even if it could, we may, I think, reasonably decline to add another to the many concessions which, unnecessarily or not as the case may be, have already been made by us in the matter of the Perso-Baluch boundary. 80. So much prominence has been given to Mirjawa and its neighbourhood, and Padaha has been so explicitly referred to in the instructions of the Persian Government to the Tamin-i-Nizam, that I foresee no possibility of making him agree to any boundary in this neighbourhood more favourable to us than that of the Holdich Agreement. Short of re-opening the whole question of the Perso-Baluch boundary, and demanding, on the strength of our recent surveys and enquiries, a rectification of the frontier w r hich w r ill give us Mirjawa in return for concessions made to Persia further south, the only course open to us appears to be to press for such slight rectification of Holdich’s boundary as may be found necessary to include the Padaha post within our territory. 2804 F. D. 1 ! &lt; '6 31. This request would, of course, be based on the same arguments as those suggested for the red boundary line, paragraphs 23 and 24 above. There is one slight disadvantage in urging this request prematurely, as there is a chance, although a very poor one, of my being able to prove that our Padaha post is outside the Persian line. The procedure I have suggested in paragraph $4r meets this difficulty. 32. The concession, by sale or lease, of a small plot (say 1 square mile) of culturible land with water'.on the right bank of the Dar-i-Ghiaban-Talab river, for growing fodder and vegetables for the adjacent posts on our trade route has been stated to be very desirable. 33. The procedure which I venture to urge should be adopted, is that the Persian Government should be pressed, forthwith, to agree to the slight recti fication of frontier required for the adoption of the red boundary line, and to send the Yamin-i-Nizam necessary authority to demarcate accordingly. In the meantime this Mission should remain in Seistan. 34. If the above request does not include the necessary rectification of boundary at Padaha also, it should be so worded as not to preclude a further subsequent representation regarding the latter place, when I have, as I feel snre I will have, to refer the matter on arrival there. So little would then remain to finish up a long and weary business that not only would the Persian Commissioner be likely directly or indirectly to support my representations, but the Persian Government would, after giving in on the first point, be less likely to make a stand on the second and final one. 35. What appears to me to be a strong argument for tackling the Perso- Baluch boundary question with the Persian Government direct, at Tehran, forthwith, without waiting for this Mission to leave Seistan and arrive at an impasse in Mirjawa, is that, when the Seistan question is settled up and we are known to have embarked on that of the Perso-Baluch boundary, Eussian diplomacy at Tehran will doubtless be more wideawake and more actively directed than at present towards thwarting our wishes in that direction. Sir Arthur Hardinge will know whether this argument carries weight, or not, and consequently whether it is better to include both the red line and Padaha in one representation, or take up the red line first, and await further reference before tackling Padaha. 36.
