Fluent in Arabic, Finch was warned by the Political Resident (Lieutenant-Colonel Trenchard Craven Fowle) not to involve himself in domestic politics (folio 1B), and by Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr of Sharjah to not travel into the interior (folios 3, 4). Office notes at the rear of the file suggest that the warning from Shaikh Sultan came after Finch had taken a truck into the interior. A note from Finch, dated 30 May 1933 states that illness has forced four men (presumably including himself) back to Basrah [Basra].</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Imperial Airways</namePart></name></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00007c#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00007c#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
