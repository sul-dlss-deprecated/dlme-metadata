In accordance with your 1100/30, the following report is submitted. It is not considered that a Jahad is likely to take place. The reports of possible raids mentioned in my 2351/30 and 1915/1 are not as yet confirmed. The area is closely watched by air reconnaisance. A raid of this description can in no way be interpreted as a Jahad. In view of this, the proposals put forward by the A.O.C. in his message to Commander-in-Chief of 20th March, and my subsequent proposals contained in my 2000/24 to the Political Resident, which latter were most definitely concurred in by the Political Resident in his 76.T to the Political Agent Kuwait, it is not considered there is any justification for retaining naval landing parties ashore at Kuwait. This confirms my opinion expressed in my 0937/29 to the Commander-in-Chief, Bast Indies. The landing of these parties has immobilised the whole of the Persian Gulf Squadron for five weeks and consequently it is impossible to obtain information on the state of affairs on the Trucial Coast so expressly desired by the Political Resident in his telegram No. l.T of 9 th March and repeated to the Co reman dei'-in-C hie f. Bast Indies. No degree of readiness is considered neces. r ary beyond the following proposed dispositions. It is considered politic to retain one sloop at Kuwait for the present and the other sloop to be sent to the Trucial Coast and on relief by 'BNTRRPRISB' to return to the Shatt el Arab. ”ENTERPRISE” to proceed to Abadan to complete with oil and later cruise on t-e Trucial Coast and as required.

Some further details by letter.Kuwait, til© Persian Gulf. To:- Air Staff Intelligence, Air Headquarters, Baghdadi Recent Polltioal lourses i n flajd As a redult of a comparison og notes by S.S.O.Buscol d S.S.O Kuwait it appears that certain deductions can now be safely made from the information forwarded in their earlier wireles signals and letters 0 Commencing from January when Akforce was forming there seems no doubt now thatat that time Palsal ad-Bawlsh was steadily growing in confidence as result of unchallenged raids. Per haps he was uncertain that the British would take the field againdt him. He had some grounds for supposing that after 3 raids without pursuit. In any case he appears to have become extremely swollen-headed, and rumours of his repeated succes sea reached Ibn Humaid of the ,T Jtaibah and Central Arabia.He tried one more raid and, although he met opposition at the hands of the Kuwaitis, he was not sufficiently deterred by this to be prevented from raiding in the same district a few days later. Meanwhile the tale of the good loot to be had with so little trouble on the Kuwait and ’Iraq frontiers war, too much for the not very clever and hot-headed leader of tk the *Utaibah, who, after pestering Ibn Sa’ud into a reluct ant permission, raised his own standard. Ibn Hithlain,whose policy it is to follow the fortunes of the Ikhwan,&amp; conse quently also their moat powerful leader Ibn Humaid, also re ceived a grudging permieolon to take hie 'Ajman to the fron tier. Muhsln al-Firm, usually a loyal follower of Ibn Sa ? ud, contented himself by ’’sitting on the hedge” as long as pos sible at Riyadh, while ’’covering himself* by ordering his sons to get a force ready for a move in conjunction with the rest of the Ikhwan. Ihn Humaid’s setting out co-incided with a raid in which Dawlsh himself was leading up the Batin on February 19th. Then for the first time the Mutair met the British aircraft in full power, were pursued that evening and all the next day, and finally bombed in their raid base at Safah.The loot distributed after the shaikhs had taken their percentage could not have worked out at higher than half a sheep a man and a small portion of a camel. To the rank and file,except perhaps in a Jihad and perhaps even then, the real incentive to raid must always be loot. Further the moral effect of bombing apjfart from casualties caused was great. At this very moment v^hen Ibn Sa'ud appeared to have lost control, and when he himself must have been hoping that as a result of the raids the tribes would suffer heavy punishment at our hands, thereby proving the rightness of his earlier orders against raiding, news of the Jarishan failure reached Ibn Humaid. Such a hot-head was not likely to do more than hesitate at this, but followed as it was immediately by a renewal of Ibn Sa’ud’s prohibitions, and the latter s cancel lation of permission for the 'Ajman to raid, he appears to have gfrawfry slowed his progress to the frontier down to tn© very lowest possible rate.From this moment there can be little doubt that he was simply locking for a reasonable excuse to go home. No doubt he hoped Ibn S&amp; uo wouxu. make him some handsome offer that would save tneir pride,lo o^tal this it was essential that he should appear to be still cent on raiding.In this connection it perhaps suited Ibn 3a ud tx too that the tribes should remain out as if raiding ^as long as he realised the actual danger past) so that there-might be no question of our demanding too much of him bne con ference which as he pointed out might take place csren at a time that he was unable to arrest the rebels, who are headstrong * 137?; headstrong”. This remark was made on the 8 th L!areh,or Just when he must have realized that the tide was turning in his favour a&amp;ain„ He appears to have let them ?.ait without any sufficiently 50 od promises until the last possible moment, when their position right up agalndt the frontier must have been quite uncomfortable, and then presumably offered them some sort of concession and a conference. Luring the period of the operations, and particularly latter* ly there has been a very large amount of 'planted” informa tion, which has been in circulation both in the tribes and in the towns 0 The source of this planted Information is too well known to need detail. In some cases the agents distri buting are known by name. This was particularly noticeable when the situation was in actual fact getting easier and easier. 3d/ K. Hindle James, Flight Lieut.

More, D.3.0,, PolitloaX Agent, Kuwait. To The Chief of the General Staff, Arasy Headquarter*, India, 3 X M L A. Sir, With reference to your letter No. M.0.3.'W', dated the ;cth April I have the honour to submit the following information regarding Kuwait:- (I) The Shamiy&amp;h Wells consist of nearly six h ndred small welle. They are situated in several groups, but the actual wells are in some oases only a few feet apart. They are not lined, and are mostly under a yard in diameter. The wells vary considerably in yield and quality; and also, to some extent, in accordance with the seasons of the year - some becoming rather brackish towards the end of the summer* One recently tested was forty feet deep, and had two feet of water, yielding forty five gallons - which, however, soon refilled. In former years these wells used to supply practi cally the entire population of Kuwait with water, but, with the great increase in population under Shaikh Mubarak's rule, they began to prove insufficient, particularly ifter a scanty rainfall* The rainfall during the winter of 1907-06 was particularly bad, and in the summer of *9^6 the water problem became acute. It occurred to one boat owner to try importing water for sale from the Shatt al-'Arab, and, as it was found that water so brought could be sold cheaply and yet return a good Profit, a regular fleet ofwater carrying boats has grown into existence* At the present day there are forty five boats, of the &gt;ype known as \A bum, employed exclusively in this trade. Of these an average of six arrive daily, each with about 8,000 gallons of water, worth roughly Rs*l00/«. More people now drink imported river water than water from the Sh&amp;niyah Wells, as, in view of the carriage from the latter, they fini it cheaper to do so* There would probably be sufficient water available from the Shamlyah Wells to supply any force likely to be stationed in Kuwait. As in the case of the townspeople, however, transport has to be considered, and it might be more convenient and economical to use Imported water* (II) Imported water - from the Shatt al-'Arab near Fao, not from Basrah - is always available in reasonable quanti ties, and could be brought in larger quantities without any trouble - boats being brought to any part of the foreshore desired. No pumps or piping are available, as the water is always landed from the boats in skins or keroslne oil tins. Large numbers of locally made wooden tanka are available. (III) One or two wells at Sirrah used to give good water, but the water is now Indifferent. Probably better water would ~ , be obtained If a new well was dug there. (IV) During the past spring the Shaikh of Muhammar&amp;h .^de a palace of his, situated outside the town but Inside the walls, available for the use of the Naval landing parties,and it proved to be sufficient to accommodate two hundred fifty officers and men. This would presumably be available % again, but th.r. ar. pr*o«o*lly no other eultabl. building* Inside the walls. The Royal Air Poros offloera and man r.o.ntly oooupl.d son. buildings outside the wall, which war. originally intended as e. Wireless Building*, but never used a* such, and are now used as a Quarantine Station for the town, and they proved sufficient for their need*. For troop* tont* would, of *our**, be aultabl# during the winter months, but from kny to jatoter British troops at any rate would be better In huts. No hutting materials are available In Kuwait itself, but It would be easy to Import reeda from 'Iraq toiraq x.o v raake th# exoellant type of hut, known as sarifah . Men to Ti Ke lie’ll would also have to be brought from ’Iraq, (V) With regard to Engineer Stores, none of the articles mentioned under (a) or (b) of your letter under reply are available looally, with the exception of portable tanks (wooden), of which a considerable number are available and more oould be built at fairly short no$loe« There Is no ice plant In Kuwait at present, but I understand that a local merchant Is Importing one shortly - though I do not know what Its capacity will be* A considerable amount of good timber (Imported from Malabar for boat building) Is always available, also locally made iron nails* Iron sheets, wire, bricks, etc., are usually not available. Bricks could probably ba obtained from Basrah, but I cannot say whether the other stores could be, or not* I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant.

Political Agency, Kuwait* &lt;24th May 1928 . To The Hon*ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B U S H I R E. Protection of Kuwait* MEMORANDUM. Reference my telegram No 063 of to-day's date. I think it is a good thing that this last section of Armoured Cars is leaving Kuwait now, as there is little or no fear of any further trouble from the Ikhwan for the next few months. There is no doubt whatever that the Shaikh and the great majority of the people of Kuwait are really grateful for the protection which we have given them. A theory, apparently started by some w politloians' in 'Iraq, that we never voluntarily leave a place we go to, and that our coming to Kuwait in the guise of protectors would cer tainly mean that we would take it over, found few supporters in Kuwait itself; and it would indeed be a pity if ideas of this sort were to gain credence through our stopping on too long. I shall be very much interested to hear whether this move means that some satisfactory news has been re ceived regarding the Jiddah Conference. Personally I shall be extremely surprised if an agreement is arrived at - and still more if it is kept - unless we are prepared to give Ibn Sa'ud a subsidy. The fact that Ibn Humaid and Dawish refused to meet him in Buraidah shows that he has still no real authority over them, and I think he is too honest a man to agree to terms, the fulfilment of which he knows he cannot enforce* In my opinion the most economical policy would be to give him a subsidy, by means of which he mightregain hig lost authority over the tribes. It would not ne$d to be very large, or permanent, and would certainly be cheaper than continued Frontier operations similar to those of the last few months. Still, I hardly think this is a policy likely to appeal to His Majesty's Government. It is difficult to foretell what will happen if the Jiddah Conference does break down: Ibn Sa'ud will certainly avoid an open breach with us if he possibly can. I have heard a suggestion from Arab - or rather, from 'Iraq - sources that he will probably try intriguing with so*e other European power, but I doubt if there is anything in that. As we are not likely to take any unprovoked action, it seems probable that, if no agreement is arrived at, or if Ibn Sa'ud agrees to terms which he cannot enforce, the desert will remain quiet until the autumn, and that raids similar to those of the past spring will start again then. I consider any renewal of raiding in the near future improbable, not only because of the difficulty of moving large parties when grazing and water is scarce, but because the grazing is so bad further south that it is of vital importance to the Mutair that they be allowed to remain in peace round Hafar, etc., for the next month or two, and it would be easy for us to prevent this if active operations were in progress* The Shaikh of Kuwait is certainly not optimistic about the future. Not only is he very anxious to get the Machine Guns and Lewis Guns referred to in my telegram No.356 of 17th May, but he is strengthening the town wall, and has Just completed one new tower on it, which I understand is only the first of several.

Although some of these were impofeaible of acceptance, he hoped to be able to compromise with them over others - for example, he hoped to be able to persuade us to demolish the posts. What pleased him most, however, was that he succe^ ed in showing up lawifch in his true colours to Ibn Humaid,aud conveying to him some ideas of what an arrogant and self- willed man he really la - thereby sowing the seed of discord between the two shaikhs, which he hopes will germinate during the three months truce which has been arranged. Oertain it is that the relations between Ibn Humaid and Dawish were not so cordial at the end of the negotiations as they had been before. Moreover, it is said in Qas^m that Dawish 1 s influence even over nls own tribe is on the wane,and that an unobtrusive, but gradual, exodus from Artawlyah itsel is beginning1 ' *9” be^ inning to take place (In this oonueotlon see my memo*' random Wo. &gt;73-S dated the i*yth ks.y Some 00 far ae to think that Dawlah will soon oeace to be an important 35^ polltioal factor In Arabia, and even to predict that some ”misadventure' will happen to him before lone.

When the R.A.F. were bore a considerable amount of their petrol and otoi^efc used to be shipped from Basrah by the B.I. steamers, and when they left they they arranged with the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation to ship their sur plus petrol back to Basrah by a steamer which was arriving that day. As a matter of fact the steamer refused to carry the majority of this owing to the tins not being in good condition. I was much surprised, therefore, when I heard of the arrival of aom© mere R.A.F. petrol by the last steamer; and was told on inquiring from the Mesopotamia Persia Corpora tion that they had been asked to store it in their ware houses with that which they already held. I assumed that the consignment which arrived by last steamer had been shipped by mistake, and that whoever was concerned had forgotten to cancel a standing order tfneii tht R.A.F. were withdrawn from Kuwait. In view of this new cor? slgnment, however, this can hardly be the case, and it looks as if the R.A.F. are forming a dump in Kuwait fr when, or if, they have to come here again.If this he the ease, I do not ^now whether the Resident has been consulted; but, if not, I think he certainly ou^ht to know, as, however convenient it may be to have a dump here^ it ia open to doubt whether it is politically sound* It has already given rise to the rumour that the R*A.P* are coming back to Kuwait shortly, which seems a great Pity, as personally I consider it most undesirable that the idem should get about that we will at once occupy Kuwait, as if it were a part of ’Iraq, if any trouble occur on the ’Iraq - Najd Frontier.

Before the month of Ramadan he and his cousin Ali had departed on a visit to H.M. the King and remained the guests of His Majesty till after the Id when both of them returned to their relatives camped with us. Uver since his return the said Haleb had morning called/and evening to our Mudhif and the news that he had raided is absolutely false. Capt. Howes the S.S.C.

I immediately called for the presence of all the Akhwan refugees camped with me and when they were present, I pointed out Faleh abu Shra Shuwairabat to the officer who did not think it essential that I should have sent for the refugees to be presented to him. To this I told Capt. Howes that it was better that he should see with his own eyes and be satisfied that the news was false.

Dated 6th September The following telegram has been received from Bahrain.Bogina: There is a persistent rumour here, based on new arrivals and letters from Najd, to the effect that Ibn Sa’ud has ordered the mobilization of the tribes on the frontier of ’Iraq but that no actual hostilities are to commence until Ibn Sa'ud gets back to Riyadh, which will be within a month.

To Resident, Shiraz; repeated to Colonial Office and Dated 7th September 19*8. Your telegram No. T-313 (No. 3-11 to London). I have no information to confirm this. I have seen Shaikh Ahmad this morning, and he thinks that the rumour current at Bahrain is in all probability the exaggeration of a report which he has received that Ibn Sa'ud has sent strict orders to his tribes to keep quiet and under no circumstances to go raiding before his return. He is said to have made use of the phrase 'Please God, our paths will be one again*, which has most likely cA veri rise to the rumour, but which the Shaikh interprets as the merest platitude. The Shaikh is convinced that Ibn Sa'ud Is striving for peace, and that he did not come to an agreement at the recent Conference merely because he could not have enforced such an agreement on his tribes. The trade agent of Ibn Sa'ud at Kuwait has received a telegram from saying that Ibn 3a’dd has leit xor Riyadh - presumably on the 4th Septemcer.

A *an of the ’AJman, settled in Kuwail and well known here, has arrived from Riyadh, which he left on 26th October. He says Ibn Huaaid had n4t then arrived there, but was expected alaost immediately. All the tribal leaders who had been summoned had been there for some tifee with the exception of him and Dawfsh. At first Ibn Sa'ud had tried everything in his power to induce both of them to cone in. Later on however he accepted Dawfsh’s excuse that he could not come himself owing to ill health, and concentrated on Ibn Humaid. The latter’s influence over his own tribe has apparently waned considerably, and the other Utaibah shaikhs offered to go and bring him by force. It is even said that Dawish, once his own excuse had been accepted, wrote and advised him to go ( the explanation being that it is only fear for personal safety that makes either unwilling to ge). In any case it was certain that Ibn Humaid was coming in, and that as soon as he arrived the business of the confer ence would be begun. If the conference proved satisfactory, as ib was now hoped it would, Ibn Sa'ud would then proceed to Hasa, and after wards to 'Uqair, where he had arranged to meet a representa- tive of His Majesty's Government.
