A pay bill may be presented at a district treasury two days before the last working day of the month by the labour of which the pay is earned ;. but see rule 217. 2 . A pay bill may, if desired, be enfaced for payment to a Banker or Agent and submitted for collection through such Banker or Agent; this will obviate the necessity of the Government servant’s attendance in person or by messenger, as payment may then be made direct to the Banker or Agent. 3. The period for which a subscription to a Fund is due should be specified when it differs from the period for which pay is drawn. 4. In the case of Government servants entitled to Sterling Overseas Pay, fund deductions are based on the Rupee Pay plus the rupee equivalent of the Sterling Overseas Pay. Note 1.—Treasury Officers should see that all compulsory deductions including those for Indian Civil Service Provident Fund are duly made and that the schedules showing particulars of Fund 'deductions, are attached to the pay bills. Note 2.—Subscribers to the Sterling Branch of a Provident Fund should note on the bill and in the Fund Schedule attached to the bill that the recoveries relate to the Sterling Branch, i MCIPC—SI—23( Audit)MFP—(1861G/M.2I28)—10-4-43—2,00,000.. 1 Lf v \ J Serial No. 1 Date of pay ment. 2 Number on descrip tive register. 3 NAME. 4 Rank or designa tion of pension er or deceased relative. 5 Late corps or depart ment. 6 ♦Signature or mark c certificate of non-em non-drawal of a sec 7 f pensioner to ployment and ond pension.
