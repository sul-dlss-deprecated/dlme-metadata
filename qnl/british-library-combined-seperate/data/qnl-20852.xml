Jones writes that, in light of the maritime hostilities, the only course open to him was to insist that the Al bin Ali tribe return to Kīsh, which they have agreed to do within two months once their vessels had undergone repairs, an interval which Commodore Ethersey of the Persian Gulf Squadron considers reasonable. Jones reports that he has also written to Shaikh Muḥammad bin Khalīfah of Bahrain, warning him against taking offensive action against the Al bin Ali, and to Shaikh Muḥammad bin ‘Abdullāh of Dammām, warning him against permitting the Al bin Ali tribe to reside any longer at Dammām.The following enclosures are included with Jones’s letter:1. Letter no.117 of 1855 (folios 53-54) from Commander Felix Jones, Acting Resident in the Persian Gulf, to Commander Felix Jones, Acting Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated 3 November 1855;2. Letter no.386 of 1855 (folios 55-56) from Jones to Ethersey, dated 6 November 1855. Three enclosures are included with Jones’s letter:The translation of a letter (folio 57) from Jones to Shaikh Ali bin Sultan of the Al bin Ali tribe, dated 5 November 1855;The translation of a letter (folio 58) from Jones to Shaikh Mahomed ben Khuleefa [Muḥammad bin Khalīfah], chief of Bahrain, dated 6 November 1854;the translation of a letter (folio 58) from Jones to Shakh Mahomed ben Abdullah [Muḥammad bin ‘Abdullāh], chief of Dammām, dated 6 November 1854.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024052050.0x00001b#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
