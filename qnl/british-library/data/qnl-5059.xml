The Minister of Finance has now submitted a Bill for a credit of 170 million rials (£2,125,000) for railway construction. M^. Bader has explained that this credit, from revenue from the sugar and tea monopoly taxation, had not included in this year s supplementary law, as the amount had not then been definitely specified. 3. The total credit for railway construction during the year ending the 20th March, 1939, is therefore increased from the sum of 105 million rials (£1,312,500), provided for in the ordinary budget estimates, to a sum of 275 million rials (£3,437,500). 4.

WITH reference to Mr. Seymour’s despatch No. 117 E. of the 27th March, 1937, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith tire estimates of the budget for the Iranian year 1317 (the 21st March, 1938, to the 20th March, 1939).() 2. The budget has been balanced with a surplus of nearly £24,000 and, as usual, the press is full of praise and attributes this satisfactory state of anau s to His Imperial Majesty. 3. The total revenue is estimated at 1,528,892,648 rials (i us f ° ver £19 million), an increase of 281,093,837 rials (£3-5 million) on the budget estimates for 1937-38. Expenditure is estimated at 1,527,018,564 rials, showing an increase of 278,986,827 rials (£3 • 4 million) over last year’s figure. 4. On the revenue side an increase of 15 million rials (£185,000) over last year’s estimate is expected from direct taxation, and 14 million rials (£160,000) from indirect taxation. As so far there has been no indication that the Hovei n- ment are contemplating the introduction of any new taxes, the increases aie anticipated from taxes already in force. . , , 5 The receipt from Customs, which for the year 1937-38 were estimated at 362 million rials (£4-5 million), are shown at 421 million rials (£5*25 million) in the estimates for the new year, an increase of 59 million rials Receipts irom the monopoly companies are also expected to increase by 62 million ria s (£775 000) Other notable increases include 46 million rials which the mining industry is expected to yield, and 50 million rials from Government investments. 6 On the expenditure side an increase of 45 million rials ,(£562,500) is shown in the estimates of the Ministry of War, which, including the gendarmerie, amount to 354,408,380 rials (£4,430,000), or nearly 24 per cent of the whole budget The estimates for 1937-38 amounted to 309 million rials (£3,867,600) 7. The Ministry of Public Instruction’s estimates are similarly on tiie increase for, whereas they amounted to 71 million rials in the previous budget, they are now increased to 81 million rials. . , . 8 On the other hand, a notable drop in expenditure is shown in the estimates of the Ministrv of Roads and Communications, where, under the item rai ways, a sum of 105 million rials (£1.312,500) is budgeted for 1938-39 as compared with 200 million rials (£2,500,000) in the previous budget This decrease of £1,187,500 is presumably due to the fact that exploitation of all the northern section of the railway from Bander Shah to Tehran and on to Qum has already commenced, and that several expensive lots in the southern section have been completed by the 9 The estimates of the Ministry of Industry and Mines have increased from 154 million rials (£1,900,000) in the previous budget to 256 million rials (£3 200 000) for the new year. This year’s estimates include credits m respect of the following: 101 million rials for the administration of mmes 36 mdlion rials for the completion and exploitation ot the cement factory, 30 million rials in connexion with the spinning and weaving industry 92 million rmls to a the simar industry (this figure includes the sum of 7,300,000 rials to be Paid to the Banque Melfe Iran, in respect of interest and capital), 18 “f’ 1 ™ glycerine and soap factory now in course of construction near at Tehran, and 14 million rials for the construction of the gas mask factory w is also being installed close to Tehran. &gt;&gt; 10 Other items of interest which appear under miscellaneous expenses include the sum of 17 million rials for the building of new customs warehouses. 1 500 000 rials increased capital of the Agricultural and Industrial an , 60 million rials in connexion with the silos which are now being erected in various (’) Not printed.

La plupart des marches internationaux ont retrouve pendant cette annee leur fermete; ies transactions ont ete plus actives et malgre les nombreuses restrictions douanieres ou monetaires,legs d’une longue periode de crise.qui subsistent encore, il semble que Teconomie mondiale tende a retrouver progressivement un equiiibre plus naturel. Notre rapport economique consacrant de longs developpements a la situation economique generale nous bornerons ici a en apprecier les consequences sur I’lran et la politique generale de votre Etablissement. * * * L’lran grande productrice de matieres premieres et de produits agricoles a largement beneficie de la reprise. Ses echanges avec I’Etranger se sont accrus a la fois en valeur et en volume. Par suite ses revenus interieurs et exterieurs ont augmente, facilitant ainsi 1’execution du budget de 1315 malgre sa forte augmenta tion sur le precedent et permettant de bien augurer du Budget de 1316 quoiqu’il atteigne le chiffre record de 1.250.000.000 Rials. Cette activite se reflete dans notre Bilan dont le total atteint.,2.160.962.236.20 Rials soit un chiffre superieur de 529.778.443.95 Rials a ceiui du Bilan precedent.L’augmentation porte sur tous les postes. La circulation notamment est portee a 813.186.220 Rials. En revanche I’encaisse metallique s’est accrue de 47.945.753 Rials. La proportion entre I’encaisse et la circulation ressort done a 87 0 / 0 ou meme si Ton decompte 1’encaisse a sa valeur reelle a pres de 100 °/ 0 ,ce qui atteste le bon equiiibre financier du Pays et laisse subsister une large marge d’emission pour les besoins a venir. Apres constitution des amortissements necessaires, le solde a repartir atteint cette annee a 47.453.025-65 Rials, soit environ 16 °/ 0 du capital contre Tan dernier 32.130.934-45 * * * La politique de votre Institut d’Emission a consiste en 1315 a mettre le Pays a meme de profiter des conditions favorables qui prevalaient sur les marches mondi- aux, en evitant toutefois une inflation des prix et du credit, qui aurait compromis la stabilite du marche interieur. Ce souci semble avoir ete ceiui de la plupart des Banques Centrales, qui tout en adaptant les credits a des besoins accrus, se sont efforces de limiter la hausse des prix dont I’exces ferait renaftre dans une econo- mie encore fragile, les risques d’une nouvelle crise. Les repercussions qu’ont cues sur les principaux marches les bruits, cependant dementis d’une revalorisation du dollar ont montre combien la plupart des marches restaient vulnerables.■ 11 ■mniMiit mimnuif THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT PERSIA.

An economic report is also included in the publication. 2. Notes in circulation on the 20th March, 1937, at 813,186,220 rials, show an increase of 219,464,000 rials (about £2,743,300 at the fixed rate of 80 rials to the £) over the figure for the previous year. The note issue has since risen considerably, and on the 4th February, 1938, stood at 874,357,875 rials (£10,929,473). 3. Gross profits amounted to 69,211,496-75 rials, the bulk representing interest which accounted for 53,268,695 • 10 rials (£665,100). The net profit is shown as 44,239,932-20 rials or about £553,000, and this, added to 3,213,093 -45 rials carried forward from last year, is dealt with as follows : 4,745,302-55 rials (10 per cent, of the total) to Statutory Reserve and a similar amount to Special Reserve; 35,217,118-00 rials credited to the Government as dividend and 2,745,302-55 rials carried forward in a new account. 4. The final balance sheet shows that the paid-up capital has been increased by 9,335,757-10 rials (£116,697), representing the value of gold abroad; this amount has been deducted from “ sundry creditors ” on the debit side. 5. The remarks towards the end of the preliminary report, in which mention is made of the exchange difficulties, were no doubt necessary though perhaps not quite convincing. 6 .

Subject.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT published in the Etaldat of the 26th October, and this was an announcement to the effect that His Imperial Majesty the Shah had handed over all his hoardings of gold to the bank; the value was not mentioned, nor is it clear whether an actual gift, or merely a deposit, was made. 2 . The press, at any rate, applaud the Royal gesture, which should serve as an example to all patriotic Iranians, who are invited to sell their gold to the bank and thus assist the national economy and prove their love of the fatherland. In view of the fact that there would appear to be a growing tendency to purchase land, not only in Tehran but in certain provinces also, rather than to retain rials, it remains to be seen if the lucky holders of gold will prove to be patriotic enough to exchange it for bank-notes. 3. The second measure was a Bill, signed by the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance, submitted to Parliament on the 28th October with a view to the sale of part of the Crown jewels; a copy of the text of the preamble and the Bill, published in the Journal de Teheran of the 31st October, is furnished herewith. 4. If these measures were taken with the hope of inspiring more confidence in the stability of the country’s finances, it is possible, and probable, that quite a contrary effect will be the result. 5. It is impossible to obtain reliable figures of the advances made to the Government by the Banque Mellie Iran, but from the last published balance-sheet of the bank, giving the position at the 7th October last, the following items are shown as assets :— On the liabilities side ‘ ‘ Administrations publiques ’' show a figure of 364,505,027 rials, or about £4,556,300. In the absence of any official figures of the Government’s debt to the bank, it may be inferred that the difference between the figures quoted above, that is to say £5,471,470, may roughly be taken to represent the Government’s indebtedness to the State Bank; its commitments with the Agricultural Bank are not known. 6 .

(No. 144 E.) 5 Sir, ^ - ——, ^ WITH reference to my despatch No. TolE. of the 9th April, I have the honour to report that, according to the Journal de Teheran of the 11th April, the supplementary budget law was approved by the Majlis after a “slight modification ” to article 6. 2. The modification provides a further sum of 150 million rials from the sugar and tea monopoly tax to complete the cost during the financial year of railway construction. The proceeds of the sugar and tea monopoly tax are not normally included in the ordinary budget-estimates, and they are automatically devoted to meeting railway construction expenses. It is very doubtful whether the fund constituted by the tax proceeds contains anything like the sum voted, but no doubt the amount in excess of cash in hand will be borrowed against future revenue. 3. With this addition, the cost of railway construction for the financial year 1937-38 amounts to 440 million rials in local currency (&lt;£5,500,000) plus £1 million in sterling. It is not difficult to imagine the effect of such enormous payments on a country with such meagre financial resources as Iran. 4.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 117 E. of the 27th March last transmitting the budget estimates for the financial year 1937-38 (the 21st March to the 20th March), I have the honour to transmit herewith a translation, from the Journal de Teheran of the 8th April, of the supplementary budget law submitted to the Majlis by the Acting Minister of Finance.^) 2. The supplementary budget law T contains fourteen articles, but only one of them appears to have any real importance. This is article 6, which provides from the “ national reserves ” a credit of £1 million for railway construction, as well as for a loan of 90 million rials (£1,125,000) from the Banque Mellie for the same purpose. The budget estimates, reported in my despatch under reference, contained a credit of 200 million rials (£2,500,000) for railway construction, the total estimated cost of which is thus £4,625,000 for the year. 3. The supplementary budget law is more remarkable for its omissions than for its content. No provision is made for the sterling requirements of the armed forces, whereas for the past few years there has been a regular vote of £2 million. No provision is made for the large textile factories—to cost more than £1 million—for which tenders have been invited, nor for the four cement factories, nor for the canalisation of Tehran’s water supply, nor for the iron and steel plant for which offers have been invited. 4. It is impossible at the moment to say whether these omissions presage a period of strict economy, or whether it is hoped to raise funds by foreign loan, or otherwise, for these purposes. Perhaps the simplest explanation is that, as the “ national reserves ” do not contain any appreciable funds, it was not considered possible to vote any appropriations from them. Further developments, in view of the critical financial situation in which the country now finds itself, will be awaited with interest. 5.

The totals of this budget show an increase of about 25 per cent, on the previous year’s estimates. 2. On the revenue side an increase of 26 million rials (£325,000) over last year’s estimate is expected from direct taxation and about 31,200,000 rials (£390,000) from indirect taxation. These increases are anticipated from taxes already in force, not from new taxation to be introduced. The receipts from customs are expected to yield 62 million rials (£775,000) more than last year’s estimates. Estimated revenue from the tobacco, opium and cotton goods monopolies amounts to 50 million rials (£625,000); the cement factory is expected to produce an increase of 47,400,000 rials (nearly £600,000). There are, however, various credits sanctioned in connexion with these industries. An increased yield of 15 million rials is expected from mines; this presumably includes the increased sales of red oxide, but may also be connected with the development of copper and nickel ores at Anarek. 3. On the expenditure side an increase of 40 million rials (£500,000) is shown from the Ministry of War, the estimate this year, including the gendarmerie, amounting to 309,408,380 rials (about £3,867,600), a little over 25 per cent, of the whole budget. A credit to help the sugar factories figures at 33,500,000 rials. No revenue from sugar factories is shown, although all eight will be in operation. Most of them are probably running at a loss. An increased vote of 200 million rials (£2,500,000) is provided in respect of that part of the construction payable in Iranian currency. 4. The expenditure on Public Health remains unchanged, but a provision of 5 million rials is made for a hospital in Tehran. With more adequate health services, including drainage and water canalisation, there would be less need for hospitals, but, in spite of the largely increased budget, no money is apparently available for such essential services. There is a small increase of 4 million rials (£50,000) in the Education estimates, possibly to meet the cost of the evening classes for illiterate adults. 5. The estimate for the Department of Mines has been raised from 12 million to 34 million rials, probably largely on account of the Anarek develop ments referred to in a preceding paragraph. Interesting new items under the estimates for this department are the provision of 10 million rials (£125,000) for a glycerine and soap factory and 9 million rials (£112,500) for a factory to make gas masks. The connexion between these two projects and mining is obscure. 6. Other expenditure items include an additional 5 million rials for agriculture, which does not suggest any striking new developments; a further credit of 22,630,800 rials for the cigarette and tobacco factory, and 40 million rials (£500,000) for “remaining expenses’’—^presumably in addition to foreign exchange—for the construction of seven grain silos. A further credit of 30 million (£375,000) is allotted for the stabilisation of grain prices, although the company set up last year to effect that stabilisation is understood to be in liquidation. A credit of 70 million rials (£875,000) is provided for unspecified public economic enterprises, and a further credit of nearly 7^ million rials (£99,750) is on account of the expensive dredger required for the Caspian ports. 7. A cursory examination of the estimates would suggest a very healthy state of things, revenue increasing by 25 per cent, without additional taxation, a balanced budget, and a large share of the expenditure being devoted to improving PERSIA.

The oil royalties are usually described as being passed tothe credit of the “ national reserve,” but the acute shortage of foreign exchange which has prevailed for over a year suggests that the disproportion between the national reserve and immediate nationa obligations is so great that all the ingenuity of the Iranian Government will not be able to balance the account without tapping some new source of supply It is commonly thought that this new source of supply will take the form of a loan contracted abioad. 9 There is a strong rumour that M. Fahimy, a former Minister of Finance and now Ambassador at Angora, is being recalled and will be appointed to succeed M. Davar. It is also said that anxious conferences are taking place at the Ministry of Finance attended by M. Ala, the new Controller of Government Monopoly Companies, with the object of presenting a report on the financial situation and on proposed remedies to His Majesty the Shah when he returns from his visit to the Persian Gulf. Some of the Government monopolies created during the last year or so are not expected to survive the critical examination to which their affairs are likely to be subjected. 10.

The withholding of detailed estimates is no doubt due to the difficult financial situation created by the shortage of both foreign exchange and local currency. A considerable deficit was expected in the forthcoming budget, and it is difficult to see how the 25 per cent, increase in the expenditure over the previous year’s total is to be met. 4. A second Bill (a copy of which is furnished herewith^)) was submitted to the Majlis at the same time as the budget, and this may affect the financial situation and facilitate matters before the 21st May next. This Bill concerned the purchase from various Bakhtiaris of founders’ shares in the First Exploitation Company and the Bakhtiari Oil Company, from which emerged the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (Limited), obtained when the former concerns started the exploitation. I understand from the Tehran representative of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company that the Bakhtiaris received what was, in the circumstances, a fair price for the shares. * The number of shares now taken over by the Iranian Government is 37,320 and the value estimated at 27,757,993*60 rials (£347,000 approximately at 80 rials to the pound). By the single article in this Bill, the Ministry of Finance would be authorised to use this sum for credits in connexion with organisations for public utility. 5.

In announcing this appointment to Mejliss Prime Minister stated that financial and economic policy of the Government is still unchanged. There is however a general belief, not to say desire, that important changes may not be long delayed. Rumour is current that an adverse report said to have been produced Dy Ala on monopoly companies may presage their liquidation or radical reform. It is also rumoured that budget, which late minister of Finance would have presented next month, shows consideraDle deficit.

[E 7460/61/34] Mr. Seymour to November 30, 1936. (No. 506 E.) Sir, Tehran, November 13, 1936. WITH reference to Sir Reginald Hoare’s despatch No. 434 E. of the 22nd September, 1934, I have the honour to report that a Bill was submitted to the Majlis on the 3rd November, and approved on the 8 th November, increasing the maximum issue of bank-notes from 800 million rials (£10 million) to 1,176,163,600 rials (£14,702,045). The metallic cover against these notes is to remain at 60 per cent. 2. In introducing the measure the Minister of Finance said that the rapid industrial and commercial developments in the country had created a demand for bank-notes which was in excess of the present supply. All the additional notes for which authorisation was requested would not be put into circulation at once, but it was cheaper to have the whole supply printed at once. The actual market value of the metallic reserve was about 120 mihion rials (£1,500,000) more than their book value, but it was not intended to change the valuation. As further developments would no doubt make the existing reserves insufficient to maintain the legal 60 per cent, cover, the Government had a plan already in operation for increasing its gold reserves. The Minister did not explain what this plan was, but in view of the shortage of foreign exchange and increasing commitments, the only possibility which occurs to me is that of purchasing as much gold as possibly internally by means of some of the notes now being printed. 3. The expansion of the note circulation in Iran has been, to say the least, rapid. By the law of the 13th March, 1932, the maximum note issue was fixed at 340 million rials (£4,250,000 at present rates of exchange) and the metallic cover was to be 100 per cent. A currency law passed on the 11 th September, 1934, increased the maximum issue to 800 million rials (£10 million), with a reserve against worn notes of a further 300 million rials (£3,750,000) and a reduction of the metallic cover to 60 per cent. No opportunity has been lost of pointing to the fact that the metallic cover, until fairly recently, was, in fact, 90 to 100 per cent, of the notes in circulation. That happy situation has now changed to such an extent that the acquisition of a further supply of gold has to be contemplated in order to maintain the statutory 60 per cent, cover. Notes actually in circulation, as reported in my despatch No. 490 E. of the 30th October last, had already reached 723,962 050 rials on the 7th October, 1936. 4. It is difficult for me to judge whether an expansion of note circulation on this scale is justified by the undoubted addition to the country’s resources in the shape of the railway and new industrial concerns, together with the needs of the large-scale commercial operations which have to be financed by the new monopoly companies. Signs are not lacking that the increasing supply of bank notes, coupled with the severe exchange restrictions, is being accompanied by a steady fall in the purchasing power of the rial. I shall not fail to inform you further should this tendency show signs of accelerating. 5.

E 6873/61/34] 8777 November 2 , 1936 ! U O o Section 2. Mr. Seymour to Mr. Eden.—(Received November 9 \ (No. 469 E.) '' Sir IN his despatch No 331 E. of the 26th July, 1935^ Sir’ H^lt'KiLdfhnll Hugessen reported on tE£ difficult currency and financial situation fac n^ the Iranian Government, due to heavy and not always prudent expenditure on railwav construction, industrial development and armaments, and concluded that a foreign loan or some less patent form of financial assistance would probably be needed in the near future. Acute shortage of foreign exchange led to the exchange control introduced on the 1 st March last, as well as to the suppression of‘some of the more extravagant Government schemes, as reported in Mr. Butler’s telegram N 0 ^ 8 / oi the 2nd March, and m his secret letter to Mr. Rendel (No 329/11/36^ of the 7th March. v ' / / 2 . Attempts are being made to relieve the exchange situation by inviting foreign countries to enter into clearing agreements. Even if the whole foreign trade of Iran were effected on a clearing basis, considerable sums of foreign currency would be required to meet expenditure on railway construction, machinery and supplies, as total Iranian exports are insufficient to provide funds to meet all these contingencies. Even the very considerable payments received for royalties and taxation from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and other revenues received in foreign exchange are inadequate at the present time, since armaments expenditure alone during the last few years has absorbed practically the whole of these payments, and the reserve of foreign exchange previously accumulated is probably by now a deficit. 3. At the time of the introduction of the exchange control, the Imperial Bank of Iran came to the assistance of the Government by placing at its disposal a supply of sterling amounting to £600,000; in return, the bank was authorised to deal in foreign exchange in the same way as the Banque Mellie, Iran. Of this £600,000, one-half was to be a reserve of foreign exchange on which the Govern ment could draw in case of need, and the remaining half was to be used to finance genuine business operations of joint stock companies, in which the Government holds not less than 51 per cent, of the capital. Mr. Oakshott, the acting chief manager of the Imperial Bank, informed my commercial secretary that the first half of this fund was still untouched, and that rather more than half of the sum held for financing the companies had been used. The Iranian Government are now asking the Imperial Bank to provide a further £300,000 for financial assistance to the joint stock companies, the scope of whose operations has grown considerably and their number increased by the setting up of further monopolies^ e.y., an import monopoly for motor vehicles and tyres, and an export monopoly for carpets. 4. Mr. Oakshott had not yet heard whether his bank had agreed to produce this further sum. He hoped that the reply would be favourable, as he was of the opinion that the Imperial Bank would maintain and strengthen its position in Iran only by adopting a positive and helpful policy; otherwise it was only a question of time before all banking business would be diverted to the Bank Mellie and the Imperial Bank would have to close down. As the money required was for financing genuine business operations, he did not think that any undue risk was involved. If the Iranian Government find later on that their commitments are too heavy to meet out of income, and further credits are required, he did not see why they should experience any considerable difficulty in raising a foreign loan. The railway, and a good deal of the armaments expenditure, were costly luxuries, but, on the other hand, a good deal of money was being wisely applied to develop ments which would increase the country’s productivity; it was quite normal to finance such expenses as these by a loan rather than by inflicting heavy burdens on the country by attempting to do so out of revenue r 865 b—2] Copy No I I5.

I now have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of the official publication of the Banque Mellie giving details of the report, the balance sheet and profit and loss account, and also an economic report on the year 1314.( 1 ) 2. According to figures published in the Message?’ de Teheran of the 27th October, notes in circulation at the 7th October amounted to 723,962,050 rials (£9,049,525), an increase of 130,240,295 rials (£1,628,003) since the 19th March, 1936. A copy of the balance sheet from which the latest figures are taken is transmitted herewith^ 1 ) 3 . The annual report of the Banque Mellie states that industrial and agricultural developments have continued to be financed, during 1935-36, by currency emission. The dangers inherent in such a policy are admitted, but in excuse it is pointed out that no reserve was available for this purpose and the capital market in Iran has not yet been organised. An adequate metallic reserve is maintained against notes in circulation, and the wealth produced by the agricultural and industrial investments is considered to be a further safeguard against inflation. At the same time a progressive increase in prices accompanying a general increase in economic activity is not viewed with disfavour, provided the price increases are not such as to endanger the expoit trade of the country. 4. The events which led up to the exchange control m March 1936 aie briefly reviewed, and the rate of 80 rials to the £ sterling then adopted is defended as being one which would allow export industries to continue to function without unduly adding to the cost of imported supplies. Instead of the usual statement concerning the utility of exchange control for balancing impor s an exports, the control is now justified as enabling a better graduation of paymen s in foreign exchange and reserving a priority for production over consump ion goods. It is hoped at some future date to obtain a definite basis for e rm currency, but world conditions are not yet considered stable enoug oi is o e attempted.^ of the econom i c report deads with industrial a,nd commercial events in the world as a whole, with particular ie 0 ® s crisis.

The comparative table giving figures for the last two years shows a considerable decrease in assets under the headings “ Disponibilites a vue and ‘•Banques et Banquiers,” which may possibly indicate the shortage of foreign exchange which brought on the control. 5.

DOthis document is the PROPERTY OF His BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S government (No. 137 E.) r v Sir, ^ Tehran, March 19, 1936. I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith a translation of the Iranian budget for the year 1315, ending the 20 th March, 1937, as published in the Journal de Teheran of the 11 th and 12 th March. The budget was passed unanimously by the Majlis on the 10 th March. 2. Revenue is estimated at 1,000,016,740 rials (about £12,500,210 at the [/ official rate of 80 rials to the pound) and expenditure at 1,000,008,484 rials (about £12,500,106). These figures show an increase of nearly 250 million rials (about £3,120,000), or a little over 33 per centum over the estimates for the previous year. » 3. Increases on the revenue side include 30 million rials (£375,000) from income tax and stamp duty; 58 million rials (£725,000) from indirect taxation; 130 million rials (£1,625,000) from customs duties (in which are included receipts from the Government’s trade in sugar, now much diminished owing to the reduction effected in the selling price of the commodity); and 70 million rials (£875,000) from monopolies. 4. On the expenditure side the usual increase of 20 million rials | (£250,000) occurs in the estimates for the Ministry of War. Including provision for road guards, the vote for this Ministry amounts to 269,408,380 rials ; (£3,367,605), or just less than 27 per centum of the total estimated expenditure,, exclusive of a credit of £2 million voted in the supplementary budget law. The f largest additional credit is one of 150 million rials (£1,875,000) for railway construction. The supplementary budget law makes further provision for the Ministry of Roads and Communications of £1 million from reserve funds and 150 million rials out of the sugar and tea monopoly tax fund. 5. Other credits necessitated by the progressive programme, industrial, agricultural and general, include nearly 5 million rials (£62,500) for public hygiene; nearly 10 million rials (£125,000) for the Ministry of Education; 5 million rials to complete and exploit the cement factory; 5 million rials for the Department of Mines; 10 million rials for the Department of Agriculture; 5,300,000 rials (£66,250) for the purchase of a Royal yacht; 20 million rials (£250,000) for economic organisations of public utility, to be ratified by special laws, and 15 million rials (£187,500) for the creation of the Tobacco Monopoly’s cigarette factory. 6 . I have, further, the honour to transmit herewith a copy of the Supple mentary Law to the budget, published in the Journal de Teheran of the 17th March. In addition to the credits already mentioned for the Ministry of Roads and Communications and for the Ministry of War, the payment of a sum of £80,000 from the Government reserve was sanctioned for payments due on account of the sugar factories.

General Amir ihosrovl told the meeting, which included the /mister of Finance and the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, that the note issue on 4th November stood at five hundred and sixty five million rials (about six million, six hundred ana forty seven tnousand pounds at a nominal rate of eighty five rials to the pound) and the reserves at seven hundred and sixty six million, eight hundred and seventy seven thousand, seven hundred and ninety five rials (about nine million and twenty two thousand pounds). V 3 # Apfcirt from the fact that the gold forming part of the Bank?e capital seems to be included in the reserves, no useful comment can be made as no balance sheet has yet been published for the year ending 21 st March, 1936s and assets held against other liabilities are therefore not known. 4 # The silver held in London, valued at thirty seven million, three hundred and eighty eight thousand, nine hundred and eleven rials (about four hundred and forty thousand pounds) is presumably part of the shipment /from the light Honourable Sir Samuel Hoare, Bart., 0.C.3.I., etc., etc., etc*, the foreign Office.- 8 - g882al00i from Iran reported in Mr# Knatchlsull-Viugeesen ’ s deepatoid Mo* 411* /i* of 20th September last# 'Tim conomist 5 ’ of 12 th and 26th uetobar give® arrivals of silver from Iran as followst- Week ended 10th October; Week ended 24th October; Bu 11 ion # £201,807* 9*093# Coin#. £314,369. 367.431* £ 671 * 800# ■xxszzaSszsttsassz £210*300* or a total of eight hundred and eighty two thousand, one hundred pounds.

IN continuation of my despatch No. 395 E. of the 7th September regarding shipments of silver by the National Bank, I am now reliably informed that the amount authorised for export is valued at between £600,000 sterling and £700,000 sterling. The rate of exchange has been steady for over a week at 86 rials to the £, which points to a stronger position of the National Bank as compared with a few weeks ago. 2. It has been stated to me that the proceeds of the sale of silver will be used to acquire gold. This seems unlikely, unless it is proposed to hold such gold in London or some other foreign centre as a security against an overdraft of “ Devisen.” 3.

WI1H. reierence to your despatch No. 415 of the 8 th August concerning the request of the National Bank of Iran for overdraft facilities in London, I have the honour to report that it is rumoured here that the National Bank have recently consigned for export 50 kharvars (1 kharvar equals 664-64 lb.) of silver, the value of which would be about £60,000. It is presumed that this measure has been taken in order to relieve in a certain measure the acute shortage of foreign exchange, but further shipments will have to be made if the situation is to be restored to normal. After a period of some fluctuations in exchange rates, the rial last week was fairly steady at about 90 to the £, and during the last few days, as a result of selling by the National Bank, the rate has further fallen to 87-50 rials. 2. It has also been rumoured that, no doubt as a result of shortage of foreign exchange, all important orders for Government account will be made in terms of rials, and on a compensation basis. Similar rumours have circulated previously, but the situation is obviously worse at present, and colour is lent to the story by the fact that a call for tenders for railway material recently issued, and reported by the commercial secretary in his despatch No. O.T. (B) 185 of the 19th August, has now been amended in the sense that quotations must also be made in rials. If this policy is generally adopted it will be practically impossible for British firms to tender for such orders in future, as the fluctuations of exchange would add too large an element of risk and the compensation obligation would be most difficult for individual firms not established in Iran. 3. Copies of this despatch are being sent to the Department of Overseas Trade (No. O.T. (B) 207); the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 83).

(No. 331 E.) WITH reference to m y despatch No. 300 E. of the 12th July, I ’have the honour to subniit the following further comments on the Iranian currency and finanpial situation based on information received from reliable sources * 2 . The National Bank, notwithstanding the recent bolstering up of its situation by the laige increase in its capital, is handicapped by a serious shortage both of rials and of foreign exchange. The shortage of rials is more inconvenient than serious, it is due to the fact that, in order to buy at a lower price the new notes which are to be shortly printed, negotiations were allowed to drag on for more than six months, and even now, so far as is known, the order has not yet been signed. The shortage of foreign exchange is more serious; it cannot be solved by the printing press, and something tangible will have to be offered against it. It appears likely that the National Bank will not find it easy to produce this counter value. 3. The rial notes now in circulation are to all intents and purposes inconvertible. Silver is no longer issued against them; silver coins have, in fact, practically disappeared from circulation. The National Bank, as well as other banks performing exchange operations, will only sell foreign exchange against rials within the limits of the foreign exchange which they can readily obtain on the market. Meanwhile, the demand for exchange is steadily increasing; railway contractors’ accounts are mounting up and they need foreign exchange as payment for machinery imported, or for transfer home as profits, salaries of employees, &amp;c. The amounts due for payment to railway contractors alone during the next twelve months for work already done will be very consider able. Further money will be required to buy rolling-stock and equipment (probably about £1 million), as well as for operating expenses which apparently have not been foreseen. 4. With such heavy inevitable expenses on hand in connexion with railway construction, one might have expected a certain amount of caution, even of parsimony, in other expenditure; yet I hear that a German firm are negotiating for an order for a dredger, four barges and a motor-tug for the Caspian at a cost of more than £200,000, and that a Dutch firm are angling for the supply of a luxury yacht for the Shah. The railway station to be built in Tehran is to cost the equivalent of nearly £500,000, and an expensive and probably unnecessary new “bourse” for Tehran is to be “un batiment bien concu et superieur a tons points de vue a ceux deja existants en Iran.” The National Bank and the Agricultural Bank are participating to the extent of many millions of rials in the innumerable new companies in process of formation all over the country. 5. A gold reserve of about £4,700,000 is held at the National Bank, but about three-quarters of that amount was recently transferred to the bank as part of its capital, and has therefore presumably been completely immobilised. In any case, the export of gold bars or bullion is prohibited, so that the reserve is not at present available for meeting any commitments. 6 . The reserve of foreign currency held abroad by the Iranian Government is, at present, very low; it is doubtful if it much exceeds £1 million. It is believed that the amounts to be received as royalties and taxation from the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company during the next two years are already earmarked, though not actually spent. 7. The possibility that the Iranian Government may, in the near future, need either a loan or some less patent form of financial assistance must, therefore, be considered, in spite of their known reluctance to recourse to financial assis tance from abroad. As the oil royalties would be the most obvious form of PEESIA. August 12 , 1935. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 4. [490 m—4]mo »** I'llie f n( security, the report that they are earmarked for two years ahead must be considered in conjunction with the fact that, under article 25 of the new agreement, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company could at any time give two years’ notice of their intention to cease operations, and hence to cease payments.

[E 4625/365/34] Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen to Sir Samuel Hoare.—(Received July 29.) IN continuation of my despatch No. 261 E. of the 14th June, I have the honour to report the following further developments in the Iranian currency situation and in the situation of the National Bank :— 2 . In the course of a discussion in the Majlis on the 30th June, preceding the re-election of MM. Farchi and Moayed Alimadi as inspectors of currency emission, a report was given by these two Deputies on their work during the past year. The note circulation had increased to 421,653,450 rials (on the 21st March, 1935), and the cover had never been less than the statutory 60 per cent. This cover did not include all the metallic reserves held by the bank and was exclusive of the gold and silver reserves of the Government which were deposited at the bank. It was now proposed, by order of His Imperial Majesty the Shah (in whose name, apparently, these reserves were held) that these governmental reserves should be added to the capital of the National Bank. 3. The Minister of Finance, at the same session, introduced a motion of double urgency authorising the minting of 5 million rials worth of copper coins of 5, 10 , 25 and 50 dinars. He said that the rise in the price of silver abroad had led to speculation by unscrupulous persons, and to the illegal export of silver coins; severe measures would be taken against such persons. In the meantime, there was a shortage of small change, particularly in frontier districts, and for this reason a further issue of copper coins was required. The Minister gave an emphatic denial to rumours, which he said were being circulated, regarding the intention of the Government to lower the proportion of silver in the coinage in order to discourage smuggling. 4. The cover against the note issue was, according to the Minister of Finance, much higher to-day than was indicated in the report of the inspectors. In some countries an excess of expenditure over revenue led to the printing of notes without backing. In Iran during the last ten years revenue had always been provided for before expenditure was approved, and surplus revenue had been employed on useful public works. Thus the country, as a whole, as well as the National Bank, had an established financial situation, which ought to have a tranquillising effect on public opinion; that opinion ought no longer to be disquieted by a rise or fall in exchange rates. The motion for the minting of the coins was approved by the Majlis. 5. It is doubtful whether public opinion regarding the currency and exchange situation will be so easily tranquillised as the Minister of Finance appears to think. The rial is at present based neither on silver nor on gold, nor pegged to any other foreign currency, and its possible future trend is still an object of speculation. With regard to the Minister’s assurance regarding the maintenance of the proportion of silver in the rial, it will be observed that this would not prevent him from reducing the size of the silver rial nor from replacing the silver coins with nickel or copper token coins. 6 . It may be of interest to record that General Amir Khosrovi, the managing director of the National Bank, mentioned a day or so ago to a member of my staff that he had recently produced a scheme which would have been very satisfactory to the financial and commercial interests of the country, but that, for reasons of which he was ignorant, the scheme had been turned down. This possibly referred to the proposal to ship silver in order to cover the bank’s oversold foreign exchange position (referred to in my despatch No. 293 E. of the 10th July concerning the Imperial Bank of Persia) which would have enabled him to close all his out standing foreign exchange transactions at a profit. Khosrovi complained that the Government, which obtained its supplies of foreign exchange comfortablyf \ from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company royalties, did not appreciate his problems as a banker. Exporters wanted a cheap rial, but even more they needed stability of exchange rates. He had accordingly submitted a further proposition, also without success, which would have secured both these objects. As the conversation was interrupted at this point, it is not clear whether he was referring to some scheme for an exchange equalisation fund, or to his oft-repeated desire for the introduction of a gold standard. The latter is perhaps most likely, as it is generally understood that an exchange equalisation fund supplied to the National Bank about two years ago was completely exhausted last year. 7. I am reporting separately on a Bill introduced before the Majlis to increase the capital of the National Bank, as foreshadowed in the last sentence of paragraph 2 of this despatch. 8 . I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade (No. O.T. (B) 151), to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 134), and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 52). I have, &amp;c. H. M. KNATCHBULL-HUGESSEN.

[E 4626/181/34] Mr. Knatchbull Hugessen to Sir Samuel Hoare.—{Received July 29) (No. 301 E.) WITH further reference to my despatch No. 300 E^of 1 re^Rng- the Iranian currency and the situation of the National Bank, I have’the honour to report that a Bill was submitted to the Majlis on the 4th July providing; for an increase m the capital of the National Bank to 300 million rials (about £3,750,000). The Bill was passed unanimously on the 9th July. 2. The preamble to the Bill states that the National Bank was established in 1927 with a capital of 20 million rials, of which 8 million rials was paid up. In view of the economic progress of the country, the extension of the bank’s activities, and the particular concern of the Government with this £ c economic axis of Iran,” it is considered necessary to increase the capital of the bank to 300 million rials by definitely transferring to it the 15,875,395-39 grams of fine gold deposited at the bank by the Government, in accordance with the law of the 12 th September, 1934. The face value of this gold is £3,156,680 85 . 4&lt;1, and 2,237,874-60 rials. {Note. —The origin of this latter sum is not clear in the preamble, but it may refer to gold purchased for Government account within the country.) The total value of this gold at a rate of 80 rials to the pound would be about 255 million rials, but as, according to the law of the 22nd Esfand, 1310 (the 13th March, 1932), the value of the rial was fixed at 0-07322382 grams of gold, the value of the gold at this rate would be 216,806,435-65 rials, and this sum is accordingly given entirely to the bank. A further sum of 1,193,564-75 rials, representing profits realised in previous years, is also added to the bank’s capital, which thus becomes 226 million rials. 3. Article 1 of the Bill provides that the capital of the National Bank be increased to 300 million rials, of which 75J per cent., made up as follows, is paid up :— (a) The 8 million rials already paid up. {b) 216,806,435-25 rials, representing the value of 15,875,395-25 grams of gold according to the gold value of the rial fixed by the Currency Law of the 13th March, 1932. {c) 1,193,564-75 rials of net profits realised by the bank for account of the State. 4. Article 2 annuls articles 2, 3, 4 (excepting the note to article 4), 7, 9, 13 and 14 of the law of the 5th May, 1927, authorising the establishment of the National Bank. 5. Article 3 provides that the Bill becomes law after its ratification by Parliament. 6. It is not clear to me what is the precise significance of the project outlined above. In the first place, the gold which is now added to the bank’s capital was already transferred to the bank and earmarked as additional cover to the increased note issue in September 1934, as reported in Sir R. H. Hoare’s despatch No. 434 E. of the 22nd September, 1934. My mystification on this matter was apparently shared by at any rate one Deputy in the Majlis, whose tactless question as to whether the transaction did not diminish the metallic cover against the notes in circulation was apparently unwelcome— £ ‘ faillit facher le Ministre des Finances,” in the words of the Setareh ye Djehane of the 10th July. In the second place, as the export of gold bullion is prohibited, it is difficult to see in what way the position of the bank will be strengthened by the addition to its capital of this gold. It seems, then, at the moment, that themeasure is one of c&lt; window-dressing ” designed to impress waverers with a greater confidence in the stability of the c£ economic axis of Iran ” than they have recently been inclined to show. 7.'

This publication, which was at first expected to be monthly, appears now to have become bi-annual, and its value as an additional source of economic information has accordingly diminished. The present number is, as is natural, mainly concerned with the recent movements in the price of silver and their effect on the rial exchange. It is admitted that, in the case of an appreciable rise in the price of silver, it is impossible to maintain the rial exchange rate steady and at the same time avoid illicit exports of silver coins. No suggestion is made as to how this situation can be controlled ; in practice, however, steps have already been taken to free the rial rate from its dependence on the price of silver, the present exchange rate of about 85 rials to the pound bearing no relation whatever to silver point, which is below 50. Silver coins will no doubt disappear from circulation in spite of a law submitted to the Majlis proposing drastic punishment for silver smugglers. The panegyric on the efficacity of price manipulations of export certificates in smoothing out the consequences of exchange fluctuations (p. 14) appears somewhat exaggerated. The reduction in the buying premium of these certificates from 25 per cent, to 10 per cent, and in the selling premium from 30 per cent, to 15 per cent, as from the 7th July caused something approaching a panic in the bazaar this week, and some firms undoubtedly incurred serious losses. . , . 3. Most of the information in the Bulletin concerning economic develop ments, including the establishment of many new commercial and industrial entei- prises, has already been reported to your Department. The official apologia on p. 42 for the degree of intervention employed by the State or its agencies in forming these enterprises, will be noted; it will be queried how fan o cia participation to the extent of 70 or 80 per cent, in the capital of these new concerns can properly be described as fortifying the sense of individual initiative 4 The final article on the import trade m motor vehicles and the cxpoi t trade in carpets is of some interest, in view of the proposal seriously considered at the end of 1934, to conduct the two trades on a barter basis the article is clearly addressed to American interests, the growing dispan^ of exports of carpets to the United States with imports of motor vehicles fiom that c^ bein&lt;r stressed.

[E 4043/365/34] Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen to Sir Samuel Hoare.—(Received duly 1.) (No. 261 E.) Sir, Tehran, June 14, 1935. IN continuation of my despatch No. 200 E of the 4th May, I have the honour to report the following developments in the currency and exchange situation. 2. At the end of the first week in May the rates quoted by the banks were about 53J rials to the £ sterling, which was still above silver point, but the banks were not prepared to sell foreign exchange at these rates. It became known, however, that sterling could be purchased in the bazaar at 58 rials to the £; faced with a revival of the “ black bourse/’ the banks raised their rates on the 8th May to 61-75. During the remainder of the month the rate remained at a nominal 60 or so to the £, the banks being as a rule unprepared to sell large quantities of exchange at this figure and the bazaar offering a higher rate. 3. A decision of some kind was evidently taken by the National Bank at the end of May, as on the 1st June the rate rose to 69, and continued to rise daily until a high level of 89 was reached on the 10th June. At this figure many sellers of exchange appeared, and the rate fell to 78 on the 12th June and recovered to 80 on the 13th. No rates have been published by the National Bank for several weeks, and the position remains uncertain. Setareh ye Djehane reported on the 4th June that the National Bank had announced that it would buy any amounts of foreign exchange presented, but that it would sell no more than it had bought, and that the transactions would be based on the law of supply and demand. The newspaper naturally concluded that the intention of the bank was to maintain, and if possible increase, its supply of foreign currencies. This report lends support to a rumour which has been current in Tehran for some time to the effect that the National Bank had very heavily oversold foreign exchange. 4. The present situation is very unsatisfactory, as no one knows on what basis exchange rates will be fixed, and there is a wide field for speculation. The National Bank’s published price per kilogramme of fine gold was 17,000 rials on the 7th June, 20,000 rials on the 10th June, again 17,000 rials on the 11th June and 15,000 rials on the 14th June. The departure from the silver standard is, of course, definite; silver rials are changing hands at the frontier at a rate of about 42 to the £ or Iraqian dinar, and these latter can be readily reconverted into paper rials at profits ranging up to 100 per cent. Silver rials still circulate in Tehran, but in the provinces, par ticularly near the frontiers, the National Bank has not been issuing them and in many places they already command a premium. Considerable amounts of rials are being smuggled abroad. 5. It seems likely that the National Bank will, as soon as convenient, issue token coins to replace the silver rials which are bound to disappear entirely from circulation before long. Copper coins are already being minted for the lower denominations, as reported by the Commercial Secretary under Overseas Trade (B) No. 83 of the 17th April last, and in addition a quantity of old stock of copper coins was put into circulation at the beginning of May. In the order for new bank-notes which is expected to be placed in the very near future, no notes of a lower denomination than 10 rials are to be printed. This seems to suggest that token coins will be issued in denominations up to 5 rials, and that the existing 5-rial notes will then be withdrawn. 6. A decision will have to be taken before very long as to the method of fixing the exchange value of the rial. The silver standard having been abandoned, the choice remains, as indicated in paragraph 4 of my despatch under reference, between the gold standard, adherence to sterling, and a managed currency. 7.

Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen to Sir John Simon.—(Received May 20.) (No. 200 E.) Sir, Tehran, May 4, 1935. IN my despatch No. 13 E of the 11th January last, I had the honour to refer to the currency and exchange problems of the Iranian authorities consequent on the higher price for silver on the London market. The situation has since become much more difficult owing to the striking increases registered in the price of silver during the last few weeks. Since the end of December the National Bank appears to have abandoned the somewhat hopeless attempt at maintaining the exchange rate of the rial higher than silver point, and as a result the rate of exchange has continued to fall with each successive advance of silver, and is now about 52 rials to the £. The situation has naturally given rise to much nervous ness and uncertainty in Iran, since in business circles any exchange transactions must be effected with the knowledge that further startling advances in the price of silver may bring down the rate still lower, and that, on the other hand, the National Bank may decide at any given moment to abandon the attempt to keep pace with silver and to fix on some other means of deciding the exchange value of the rial in terms of foreign currencies. 2. The leading article in the Journal de Teheran of Friday, the 3rd May, is indicative of these anxieties. After pointing out that, owing to American silver policy, the rial has risen in four months from 82 to 52 to the £, the article asks whether a further rise is likely or whether therein ay be now a certain tendency to a fall. The writer professes to have no official information on the subject, but points out that other factors have to be considered besides the price of silver. These factors include the relation between supply and demand of foreign exchange, the freedom of movement of silver to and from the country, the monetary policy of the local banks, and the situation of the national balance of payments. The export of silver is prohibited and the trading balance is adverse; the authorities obviously cannot contemplate with equanimity an excessive appreciation in the exchange value of the rial such as will make exports even more difficult to effect. On the other hand, the high value of the rial facilitates the importation of foreign products, some of which are needed for the industrialisation of the country, reduces the upkeep cost of the many Iranian students abroad, &amp;c. 3 . The writer concludes that the situation is complicated, and should be studied so that advantage may be drawn from it in so far as it is favourable to the economic and financial interests of the country, and the brake be applied sharply as soon as it is felt that a further increase in the exchange value of the rial would be harmful. In the midst of general instability the national sil\ei currency has in general proved very stable, and efforts must be made to maintain this stability against an excessive appreciation. . . . , 4 The article not unnaturally does not give any clear indication as to what action, if any, the National Bank is likely to take m the near future. It does, however, suggest that it may prove necessary to take some action to protect the exporting interests of the country. There is a widespread belief that it is intended at some convenient date in the near future to cut adrift from si ver and to issue some form of token currency. The amount of silver com actually in circulation is not known with any degree of exactitude, but it is thought that probably two-thirds of the whole amount is already held by the National Bank. The question will still have to be decided on what basis the exchange relations of the rial to foreign currencies will be regulated. The director of the National Bank has several times expressed his preference for the gold standard; adherence to sterling would have definite advantages, since most of the trade of the countrj r415 u—1] I 'is effected in that currency, and the royalties of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are also paid in sterling; an attempt by the National Bank itself to peg and control exchange rates is not impossible, but would not inspire great confidence. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade (No. O.T. (B) 94), to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 90), and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 30). I have, &amp;c. H. M. KNATCHBULL-HUGESSEN.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT PERSIA. January 28, 1935. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 2. [E 613/365/34] No. 1. IN Sir Reginald Hoare’s despatch No. 4 34 E of the 22nd September last, reference was made m paragraph 11 to the possibility of extensive smuggling of silver coins abroad following the stabilisation of the rial at a rate well below its intrinsic value. The low rate of about 80 rials to the pound, which was maintained during 1934 with a view to assist the export trade, whilst the silver value of the pound was sometimes as low as 69 rials, resulted in considerable contraband exports of the metal, and shortage of silver rials has been reported from various districts. Towards the end of December the National Bank reduced the rate, which had touched 82 rials, to 76 rials to the pound within a few days. The following extract from the December diary of His Majesty’s consul 'at Kermanshah is of interest in this connexion :— £C Till the rate was lowered towards the end of the month the temptation to smuggle silver out of Persia was great and local stocks became very short. For some while the National Bank paid out no metal except damaged silver or nickel. Yet the fear of the authorities was sufficient to prevent any signs of a run on that bank. Confidence in the notes naturally has decreased. At Qasr-i-Shirin they were quoted at a 12 per cent, discount on silver, but no one ventured to quote a rate publicly here.” 2. The commercial secretary was informed that towards the end of December, before the rate of exchange was reduced, smuggled silver from Persia was arriving at Bagdad at the rate of 1 million rials (£12,500) per week. No doubt the same thing was happening over other frontiers, and probably a fair amount was going to India either direct or through Afghanistan. Even with the rate of 76 rials to the pound, it is probably still profitable, but the fact that the rate has remained at that figure may mean that a check, perhaps only temporary, has been effected on these illicit exports. 3. I am told that, since the change in the rates, the National Bank are refusing to sell forward foreign exchange. This tends to confirm the view that the bank are not likely to raise the rial to a higher exchange value, and that as soon as they can conveniently do so they will mark it down again. Possibly, in the meantime, they may take steps to c £ attract ’ ’ as many silver coins into their coffers as possible, but it is doubtful whether this measure would have any real success. 4. The proposal of the National Bank, reported in my despatch No._5l7_E of the 27th November last, for the adoption of the gold standard by Persia, seems unlikely to be accepted in the near future, and I was told a few weeks ago that it had’been rejected by the Council of Ministers. There are already rumours, which in the circumstances are not surprising, that the authorities intend at an early date to debase the coinage by reducing the silver content of the rial by one-half. 5. In view of these problems, the position of Colonel Khosrovi, the Persian director of the National Bank, is no sinecure, and it lemams to be seen whether he can maintain it with the rather slender technical experience at his command. If he brings the rial rate approximately to silver point he could probably stop the smuggling and hoarding of silver, but at the cost of inflicting an impossible burden on the export trade. If he depreciates the value of the rial, or attempts to debase the coinage, large amounts of silver will certainly be lost. The present situatkm is not satisfactory, and can hardly be maintained indefinitely. It is possible that a way out may be found, but it is also conceivable that the Persian f315 ee—2]authorities may already be regretting their light-hearted dismissal last year of an experienced manager of the National Bank in the person of Herr Horschitz Horst. 6.

No special comment is called for in connexion with the summary, most of the features of which have been previously reported. The claim that the State receipts continue to show a surplus over expenditure is again made, but is not substantiated. In studying the figures of foreign trade given it must be recollected that the most important item, namely, exports of mineral oil, is excluded, and that a real favourable balance is shown as a technical adverse balance. 3.

Economic Situation in 1312 (Summary of Introduction to Report of National Bank of Persia for the Year 1312). THE general situation has been affected bv world depression, the fall in the value of the dollar and pound, increasing tariffs, &amp;c. Government stepped in to prevent discouragement of individual traders. Government action included public works (railways, roads, factories), establishment of commercial, industrial and banking institutions, direct and indirect subsidies to private enterprise, municipal development. Crops in 1312 were generally satisfactory and, being mainly for internal consumption, the country was spared some of the consequences of external fluctuations. The bank has pursued a helpful policy, but has had to be conservative owing to its recent establishment and lack of adequate reserves. Finance and Public Works. Sane banking and monetary conditions are claimed, State receipts always showing a large favourable balance mainly devoted to financing public works. Expenditure on railway was 239,945,775 rials and £66,506—say, £3,066,000. Expenditure on roads was 72,157,994 rials (about £900,000). The completion of a sugar factory at Kehrizak and a cement factory at Tehran, the beginning of a sugar factory at Shahi and the extension of State-owned mines are recorded. Income during the year consisted of 605,912,227 rials, budget receipts, 97,194,106 rials Sugar and Tea Monopoly, 54,700,881 rials road tax—total, 757,907,214 rials (£9,474,000), plus Anglo-Persian Oil Company royalties, £3,922,894. Foreign Trade. Imports during the economic year June 1933 to June 1934 amounted to 681,757,000 rials (about £8,500,000), as compared with 611,665,000 rials in the previous year. Exports were valued at 457,684,000 rials (£5,700,000), against 522,040,916 rials last year. The adverse balance thus increased from 89,624,084 [290 r—10]rials to 224,063,000 (about £2,800,000). The size of the adverse balance is attributed partly to the falling off in exports, but largely to the increase in imports for Government account, which rose from 133,169,271 rials last year to 243,957,027 rials (£3 million) in 1933-34. The diminution in exports is attributed to foreign exchange fluctuations and to the fall in the price of export certificates, as well as to world crisis. The Foreign Trade Monopoly Law, it is claimed, prevented an even steeper fall in exports. Import trade was affected by falling prices, first abroad and then in Persia. Import quotas were frequently larger than the real requirements of market. Merchants did not have real opportunities for satisfactory business. Remedies suggested a sound monetary policy minimising exchange fluctuations; also administrative simplification of the Foreign Trade Monopoly Law, if necessary with abolition of import quotas, but with maintenance of balanced trade as objective. In case of necessity, the conclusion of barter or clearing arrangements with other countries. Better packing and sorting of ' Persian export produce. Necessity of creation of centre of rapid and exact economic information (presumably refers to proposed Bourse). Exchange. Repayment of Imperial Bank of Persia notes caused the latter bank to throw on the market large sums of foreign exchange to buy silver krans, thus increasing stocks of foreign exchange held by merchants. The price of silver also forced up the value of the rial. Value of rial was 5 per cent, above its metallic value; in 1311 it was 6-5 per cent, below. Exchange value of rial was affected only to a certain extent by price variations of silver and to a larger extent by speculation, but the possibility of illegal export of silver rials and krans prevents exchange from falling far from silver parity. In order to avoid this passive subjection, the abandonment of the a silver standard is advocated in order to retain monetary independence. Large i Government holdings of precious metals and foreign currency make a change | possible. Money Market. The situation of the money market is described as £&lt; confused,” owing to lack of organisation as well as the abnormal commercial situation. The need for an organised money market is stressed, as also for a market for Treasury bonds, a rediscounting system, and good-class commercial bills signed by a bank. The note circulation has continued to increase during the year, and the cover in gold, silver and foreign currency is more than adequate. S. SIMMONDS.——— THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT : PERSIA. December 17, 1934. CONFIDENTIAL. i &lt; 3 b Section 2. [E 7527/352/34] No. 1. Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen to Sir John Simon.—(Received December 17.) (No. 517 E.) Sir, Tehran, November 27, 1934. IN Tehran despatch No. 502 E of the 15th November, paragraph 5, Sir R. Hoare had the honour to report the proposal put forward in the annual report of the National Bank for the adoption by Persia of the gold standard. 2. Colonel Amir Khosrovi, the managing director of the bank, told the commercial secretary at a dinner-party on the 18th November that the project for putting Persian currency on the gold standard had already been approved in principle, and would shortly be submitted for the approval of the Majlis. Mr. Simmonds reminded him that Persia had already gone on to the gold standard twice, but that nothing had happened. Colonel Khosrovi laughed, and said that this time they meant business. Asked if he did not consider it somewhat rash for Persia to go on to gold at a time when there was a possibility that still more countries might abandon it, he replied that Persia was a small country with adequate financial resources, and he did not anticipate any special difficulties. With the price of silver recently as high as 25d an ounce, the normal exchange rate of rials against sterling would be about 66, whereas his bank had been making efforts to maintain an approximate rate of 80. 3. In speaking of financial resources, Colonel Amir Khosrovi mentioned the figure of “un milliard ” rials, or approximately £12^ million at present rates of exchange. The cover against the note issue was reported, in Tehran despatch No. 434 E of the 22nd September, to consist of gold bars to the value of 280 million rials, silver bars and coins 423 million rials, and foreign exchange 37 million rials—a total of 740 million rials. This is 260 million rials short of the “ milliard,” and one may therefore assume that this balance, representing approximately £3J million, consists of the total holdings abroad of the Persian Government. This amount tallies approximately with the £3 million hazarded in Tehran despatch No. 361 of the 28th July last. 4. Colonel Khosrovi said that the project of the Bourse, also referred to in the bank’s annual report, had likewise been approved, and that a building for this purpose would be erected in the Place Tekieh, near the Bazaar, at a cost of 400,000 tomans (about £50,000). 5.
