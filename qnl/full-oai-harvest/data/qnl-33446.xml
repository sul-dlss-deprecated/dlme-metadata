It also further explains that the presence of two French adventurers does not alarm the Resident. Throughout the letter gifts to various individuals are discussed and request is made for an update on how close Jaffer Ali Khan is to acquiring a copy of the item he was originally tasked with. A claim is also made that the British are loyal to their friends, but the Resident also boasts that Bussorah [Basra] could be taken easily if necessary. Finally the Resident cautions Jaffer Ali Khan over the activities of Shaik Abul Hassan, whom he claims has been trying to blackmail his way into British employment.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100075534085.0x000073#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
