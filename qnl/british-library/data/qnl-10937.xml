The Indian Government archives which date from the eighteenth century to August 1948, are composed of five separate series, i.e. 1. Old Series - eighteenth-nineteenth century. 2. 'A' Series - Confidential &amp; non-confidential 3. 'B' Series - Non-confidential. 4. Bound Confidential files. 5. Unbound Confidential files - app. 1940-48. None of the last four series conforms to a precise epoch, and it may therefore be necessary to search through several series for a required file. Very roughly the 'A' series succeeds the old series, the 'B' series and the Bound confidential series succeed the 'A' series, and the unbound confidential series succeed the bound confidential series. There is however some overlapping in each case between the earlier and the later series. 1. Old Series . These run in chronological order. They have been weeded and there is a rough index. 2. ' A' Series . The files in this series are divided into broad categories, indicated by a number, according either to the subject or the area with which they deal. /WithinWithin these categories each particular subject is numbered. Each subject is dealt with on one file, and different volumes of each file are indicated by a small roman numeral. 3. ' B' Series . From the explanatory note in the front of the index to this series it will be ssen that their territorial group headings have been abolished in favour of subject group headings. Within each group each file concerns a separate subject, each having a separate number. Each file therefore (and each subject) has a group number and a number within the group. Different volumes of one file are distinguished by small roman numerals. It would be s urmised in reading this explanatory note that this series contains all the successor files to those in the 'A' series, but this is not the case. The 'B' series contains only non-confidential files; the Successors to 'A' series confidential volumes being found amongst the ''Bound Confidential' series. There is an index to the group headings in the front of the 'B' series index, and a table which gives the equivalent numbers of 'A' series files. 4. Bound Confidential Files . This is probably the most used series. The group headings are by subjects and areas, like in the 'A' series. Unlike the other series the /groups- 3 - groups are indicated by a letter. The files in each group are numbered serially, but there is no principle (apart from a rough date order) governing the order in which they are numbered. Each subject has a number corresponding to the number of that subject in the 'A' series. Successive volumes dealing with a particular subject are distinguished by Soman numerals following the subject number. Thus in this series each v olume has two numbers (i) A letter and a serial number (e .g. A.l) indicating its group and place within the group. This is really only a sort of shelf-mark, though it is a convenient way of referring to the volume, (ii) a subject number plus, sometimes, a Roman numeral showing the number of the volume in that subject series. Since the group headings do not conform strictly to those in the 'A' series, there is a guide in the back of the index, giving the volume numbers by reference to the subject numbers of the 'A' series. This guide is, of course, only of use where the number of the equivalent 'A' series file is known. The list ofgroup headings is in the front of the index. 5. Unbound Confidential files . This series, aS may be surmised, contains the successors to the Bound Confidential Files, the /difference_ 4 - difference being that the system reverts to that of the 'A' series files, taking more or less the same subject headings and foregoing the volume letters and numbers used in the bound confidential series. However, as mentioned previously, the files do not cover a specified period, and although the series consists mainly of files dating from about 1940-48, earlier volumes may be found therein. Owing to the lack of a comprehensive index to the Indian files, there is attached a short alphabetical guide to subjects which may not be easily found in the indexes contained in the lists of the\arious series.
