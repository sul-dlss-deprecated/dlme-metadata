The letter, along with Prior’s reply which is also dated 30 July 1931, relates to the signing of a contract with a contractor for the Eastern Bank’s new building in Bahrain. Bardon’s letter asks whether a contract may be signed in Iraq, and if a company could be sued locally for work not carried out under such a contract.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Building contracts</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Eastern Bank Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000108#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
