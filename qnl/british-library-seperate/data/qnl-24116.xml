The letter also highlights the work that Pelly did during Goldsmid's absence and outlines Goldsmids attitude and actions on his return to work. Enclosed with this letter are copies of four letters from Jacob to Lord Elphinstone 13 November - 1 December 1856 discussing Colonel Goldsmid's request to resign from civil employ in Sind and giving the background and reasoning behind it.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024079755.0x000017#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
