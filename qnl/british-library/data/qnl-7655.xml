IRRIGATION REPORT OF THE PERSOAFGHAN ARBITRATION COMMISSION^ 190^-1905. VOLUME I. Report and Appendices. SIMLA: GOVERNMENT CENTRAL PRINTING OFFICE.From » T. R. J. WARD, Esq., Irrigation Officer, Perso-Afghan Boundary Commission, Seistan, To Sir LOUIS W. DANE, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. Dated Simla, the j/st March iqo 6 . Sir, I HAVE the honour to forward In print the irrigation report on Seistan. It is bound in two volumes, so that the Statements and Calculations may be more easily referred to when reading the report. I regret that I am not able to submit an atlas of maps and sections now, but the work of reproducing the sections must of necessity take time ; while the irri gation map cannot be prepared until the Survey of India have had time to prepare new editions of all the sheets on a scale of four miles to an inch which contain the work executed by their Survey Party with the Mission under Mr. G. P. Tate. When the new editions are ready I shall be glad to assist in preparing an irri gation map of Seistan. In the meantime one of the sheets of the map of Seistan brought out in 1905 has been utilised for the draft of the map. In the Appendix at the end of this report a list is given of the plans and sections, field and note books made by the Irrigation party in working up the information. These have been packed in a tin-lined box and filed in the Foreign Office at Simla. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, T. R. ]. WARD, Executive Engineer, Irrigation Officer, Seistan Mission. G. C. Press, Simla.—No. S. 644 F. D.—2*4*o6.—55.—B. B. C.INTRODUCTION. - 1 - • • ;f ; n&lt; ) J. In Seist^n, as In Egypt, there is no cultivation without irrigation, both owe their existence to the fertility brought to an almost rainless tract by the surplus waters of a far distant catchment, no account of the community living in such an oasis would be complete without a description of the river on which they are supported, and the methods by which they obtain and distribute among them selves the abundance, which nature has provided, in this unique way, in the midst of an extensive desert. In such a tract irrigation and cultivation are words that have the same meaning, and since the description of the river and the community it supports has been given in the “ Revenue Report and Notes ”, this report is supplementary to that, and deals only with those scientific problems that we study to discover to what extent, we could, from our experience in India, increase the irrigational powers of the water. To this end pains have been bestowed on the catchment area from which the water comes, to the trough by which it is conveyed to the terminal lake, and on the terminal lake, or inundated area, as well as on the lands upon which the cultivation is obtained. Then on the rainfall from which this priceless resource is got and the evaporation by which so large a part of it is wasted. With this informa tion, and an intelligent and sympathetic examination of the means by which man has, through countless ages, put this water to his service, we will be in a position to conceive howto obtain the more efficient control over the river that the great advances in practical skill in materials and the useful arts has placed in our power. The Russo-Afghan Boundary Commission of 1884 made very complete surveys and descriptions of the mountains drained by all the rivers that end in the Seistan Lake ; it is hoped that this Mission has perfected this by its surveys of their troughs and deltas. So that with our experience on the plains of India, and in the Peshawar valley, we are now able to form a correct estimate of the poten tial agricultural wealth of the Middle Asian plateau The essential difference between the rivers of Middle Asia and Asia Minor and those in India is that the rainfall of the former is all in the winter and spring, while the summer is dry and cloudless, and in Seistan a period of high wind : evaporation losses are great; the supply dwindles in the later hottest months to its minimum, and does not begin to recover till autumn approaches with its shorter, cooler days. The wealth of the country is, therefore, in the spring crop of wheat and barley, and the rulers in the past seem never to have tried to control the supply for maturing large areas of the more valuable autumn crops of cotton and rice, as, judging from Sir William Willcocks’ reports, they did in Mesopotamia. This valuable autumn perennial supply is, probably, all derived from the main stream of the Helmand that drains the Hazarajat; it is conveyed to Seistan in a river that flows through hot deserts in a long, narrow, deep trough having only a narrow ribbon of culturable soil along one or other bank ; that water reaches the delta in such useful volumes during the period of low river is due, probably, to the fact that the trough is cut in close grained alluvial that is remarkably staunch. The volume of water that reaches the delta is sufficient for the cultivation of all the culturable soil therein, provided the duty is improved to that which obtains in India and Egypt. In Chapter X it is shown that about 750,000 acres of spring crop and 250,000 acres of autumn crop could be annually cultivated on the average, if suitable works of control, distribution, and drainage were carried out. The problems connected with the designing and execution of these works are fully discussed, and all the information likely to be required is given. No designs have been made, as this was beyond the scope of our work, which was to collect information required for the settlement of the water disputes while doing this the knowledge of the country placed on record in the plans and sections that accompany this report and in the notes given in the “Revenue Report and Notes' was obtained : only so much work has since been done, as was needed to make this information readily available, so that valuable advice may be given when required, as it is someday sure to be, for the fame of the skill of the British in irrigation works in India is widely known in these countries, where water produces more wealth, even than it does in India. C644FD2 » Seistin has been the home of ‘^^raVtnfcen^s'frey^e^ed races; in this arid country the changes desire to so design the contemp- and strike the imagination, and create a na u , subject to the catastrophes, lated works that they will outlast time, an Seistan and Mesopotamia which history, tradition and the ruins s ow , . country have been dwelt on after each series of centuries. these a /P ectS a ° f ' h 'J U Jpessimism, but from at great length in this report, it is not t , t h e g lessors to be learnt there- interest in the past and an ^ ndeavour , ^ d tha/nature is at work making small, from. Indian irrigation engineers understand that nature is a, ^ wor f d this but continuous changes m irrigation works asm ^ the Chenab due to changes of administration that did not occur till those l ' h , e commu y&gt; who possessid the practical skill to control the river, were annihilated. In concluding this report it is my privilege to hear grateful testimony to the help I received from Colonel McMahon, the British Commissioner, and from my brother officers on the Mission. Colonel McMahon’s prescient or g a j nized the party and directed its operations, while the cordial co-operation ot the members of the Mission secured the results. It is my duty to record the good services of the subordinates selected by the Punjab Government for deputation with me to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. That they are men of exceptional merit will be evident from the way they kept their health, and were always ready for work under all extremes of climate. To employ the long windy hot weather of 1904 working up informa tion, the autumn in sudden and enthusiastic energy building pillars across a waterless desert, and the winter of exceptional blizzards in surveys m the reed marshes ; the spring in working up the information collected and, then, without any relaxation of effort to march to Quetta in the hottest time of the year—to sit down at Simla to work up the information—without being sick or sorry, speaks of exceptional self-control and great zeal for the service of Government. ^ I append their names and the work with which each was more particularly associated. Lala Thakur Dass, Supervisor, had been strongly recommended by the officer in charge of the work for promotion to the Assistant Engineer grade for his splendid work on the Jhelum Canal in 1902. He has great _ aptitude for engineering and scientific work, as well as a high character, which gives him great control over all classes of people. His work is of the highest quality and invaluable, as will be manifest to any one who studies the plans and notes. His studies of’the Naizar and the River represent a vast deal of arduous work carried out in all extremes of climate and of exposure. He also found time to make some valuable studies among Saiyads and Potters. Amir Singh, Zilladar, enjoys a high reputation in the Punjab for his ability in revenue work and his influence for good among zamindars and the petty revenue establishment. With great courage, he addressed himself to the colossal work of compiling the area of cultivation done in each village of Persian and Afghan Seistan ; the results are embodied in the statements in Volume iii of the “ Revenue Report and Notes.” While doing this he collected much of the detailed inform ation on which the notes on revenue are based. His capacity for work and his ability in dealing with the people smoothed the way for the irrigation enquiries and assisted me to an understanding of the country w r hich I should not otherwise have attained to. He also found leisure to collect the interesting material on which the notes on herd and flockowners and weavers is based. Babu Ghulam Kadir had much experience on river surveys and discharge taking in the Punjab; throughout the stay of the Mission in Seistan he attended to this branch of the subject.. He is an excellent draughtsman and made many careful measured drawings of the more interesting of the ancient ruins. He is an energetic and capable man and was a great acquisition to the party. Babu Hari Singh Bhari was an experienced surveyor and accurate leveller and also a skilled mapping draughtsman. The reliability of his lines of levels and surveys added much to the completeness of our work.3 The late Babu Nur Husain was trained in the Survey of India and worked for years on the surveys of the Chenab and Jhelum Canals ; his work was excellent and his zeal and enthusiasm great. His untimely death was a great grief to all the party. Babu Gopal Singh is a young and energetic surveyor of great promise, who did much valuable levelling work and endured much exposure. Since my arrival in Simla I have worked under Mr. E. H. S. Clarke, C.I.E., Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, who has greatly improved the quality of this work by his kindly advice and ready assistance. It will be gathered from the opening remarks of the glossary in Appendix 42 of the “ Revenue Report and Notes ” that the spelling of Vernacular words is likely to be a matter of some difficulty in Seistan. Khan Bahadur MaulaBakhsh, Political Attache to the Mission, by many hours of labour on the proofs has secured uniformity out of the chaos that existed in the manuscript, his work will be appreciated by all who read these reports. Both reports have been printed at the Government Press, Simla, and have given the Superintendent and his staff more work than the finished appearance would lead one to suspect. I am indebted to Mr. H. Vaughan Rees for the friendly way in which he has persevered to get the best result from the raw material given him : every page of the “ Revenue Report and Notes” contained figures to be arranged as well as Persian words to be carefully scrutinized and compared ; the Irrigation Report, too, contains a large mass of statements difficult to set up to the best advantage. The members of His Majesty’s Consulate in Seistan have generously helped me with information about the state of the river since the Mission left Seistan ; as this has been a typical dry year, the information was invaluable to me. I hope that it will be possible to keep up the record of the River and the Naizar in some such form as that given in Appendix 24 of the “ Revenue Report and Notes”; such information is invaluable in designing irrigation or drainage works. I would suggest that members of the Seistan Consulate be encouraged to draft addenda and corrigenda slips to the information in the Mission notes, with a view to keep them up to date. It is a work of some magnitude to prepare a fresh note, but it is easy to check any particular piece of information in which one takes an interest, and then draft a brief record of the result suitable to be printed and added in its proper place in the Mission notes.ISYNOPSIS OF CONTENTS VOLUME I.

The catchment area of the Seistan Lake. The trough of the Helmand River below Kala-i-Bist. The catchment area of the Seistdn Lake has been coloured on the map of The area Of this basin. Afghanistan, scale 16 miles to an inch, lssue and each drainage separately shewn. The same has been done on a copy of Lord Curzon’s map of Persia obtained from the Intelligence Branch through the kindness of Major C. Wanliss Deputy Assistant Quarter Master General. The area of each part of the catch ment has been ascertained by planimeter, and the results in square miles are given in Statement Alpha. The areas and distances worked from both maps agreed very closely ; where they differed the areas from the map on the larger scale have been accepted. ^ , The catchment area of this great basin is worthy of careful study by the Irrigation Engineer. The lake is situated at the south-west extremity of the General description of the catchment of the lake. hasin, which is TOUghly rectangular in shape, measuring nearly 500 miles from east to west and nearly 300 miles from north to south, in actual area 125,069 square miles, about the same as the catchment of the River Indus above Kala Bagh. The sources of the principal rivers are in the ranges that lie between the Hindu Kush near Kabul and that part of the Paro-Pamisus that lies near Herat; they drain a large area of the mountains aptly described by General Ferrier* as a natural fortress thrown up in the centre of the great Asiatic table-land. The general elevation of the bed of the northern portion of the lake is about 1,59° feet above mean sea level, the usual level of the water in the flood season being about 10 or 14 feet higher than this. To this depression the main stream of the Helmand brings the waters from the Kuh-i-Baba, whose peaks rise to an elevation of more than 16,000 feet; this eastern extremity of the basin is over six hundred miles away from the terminal lake; the sources of the perennial flow of the Helmand are within 50 miles of Kabul. The tributaries that join the Helmand at Kala-i-Bist drain the northern slopes of the Western Suleiman mountains, long narrow catchment areas travelling from north-east to south west in which there are peaks that rise from 10,000 to 14,000 feet hio-h. The Farah Rud and Harud Rud drain the southern slopes of the Siah Band' range of the Paro-Pamisus; the peaks at the sources of the former rise to over 11,000 feet and those at the sources of the latter to over 10,000 feet. Wedded in between the catchments of the main stream of the Helmand and the Farah Rud is that of the Kash Rud which, though its catchment does not extend far enough to the north to reach the main ranges, yet it drains an area of elevated mountain land; for on the watershed between it and the Farah Rud is the Kuh-i-Kaisar over 13,000 feet high, visited by the enthusiastic General Ferrier in July 1845 and described by him as the Chalap Dalan. In winter, in the clear weather after rain, the ranges and peaks to the north are visible from Seistan. The above rivers drain the mountainous country of Afghanistan, and it is the water that they bring, which forms the lake and the watered lands on which cultivators, herd and flock-owners thrive. It may be noticed that the Helmand drains 180 miles, the Fardh Rud 120 miles and the Harud Rud 60 miles of the length of the high mountain ranges, that stretch from Herat to Kabul, that the peaks in the first length rise from 16,000 to 18,000, in the second from 10,000 to 12,000, and in the last from 6,000 to 8,000 feet above the sea. To the west of the lake a considerable area of the Persian hills of moderate but useful elevation are drained by the Bandan and Madar; these are torrents rather than rivers, but they bring down large volumes of water in years of good spring rain. On the south-western boundary of the basin are the Palan Kuh and the Alluvial plains of desert. Baluchistan hills ; it is doubtful if any water from these ever reaches the basin, though good showers fall on them in most years in winter and spring ; all must be absorb ed in the porous shingle of the glacis; if any escape from the Baldchistan hills, it is caught in the sand that intervenes between the hills and the basin. * Caravan journeys.[Chap. i. Included within the catchment are alluvial plains * of vast area, such as the Registkn, the Dashtd-Margo ^ BonSy The Registdn was traversed by this Mission as by Kuh-i-Khan Mission of .884. The route through Najb Kh 4 n^nan R and Nashin has been described m Appendi ^7 been described in the Intelli* and that through Garmushkt to Khawaja Ah h . . „ rp, Dasht- ^Margowas^tr^versed 3 by the Shaml^water “ESt SHEH and September 1S45, and later on by many others, especially during the Afghan campaign of 1842, and quite recently by Colonel Yate.$ From these descriptions, and from what we have seen ourselves, we realise that nearly all the rainfall that descends on these vast areas is caught in en closed basins and evaporated by the sun. Such basins, ocally called usually of large area and very flat, so the water lies on them in a _ shallow sheet and is soon dissipated. The only water that reaches the river is that of the rain which descends on the slopes of the scarp of the trough which are cut at places by ravines that extend for long distances inland. Such water is heavily laden with rich fine thrice water deposited alluvial that makes it such a very valuable deposit on the land. In the spring there is much good grazing on parts of these plains or Dasht y and the flock-owners visit them each year. An area of about 6,437 square miles to the north-east of the^ valleys of the Arghastan and Tarnak drains to the Ab- The Ab-i-istada. i-Istada by the Ghazni and Paltu streams. Colonel McMahon says this lake has been visited by Lieutenant ]. S. Broadfoot in 1839, and that his notes will probably shew to what extent the lake overflows into the Arghastanjl. In Lord Curzon’s map the Lora tributary of the Arghastan is shewn to rise in this Lake, but the upper portion of the stream is shewn dotted as not having been surveyed or as open to doubt. In the 16 miles to an inch map the western and southern shores of the lake are shewn in fud line, and there are streams flowing into the lake which indicate that there is a high ridge separating the head waters of the Arghastan from the lake. The Ghilzai camel men with the Mission, in whose country the lake is situated, say that once in S years or so at times of exceptional flood the water overflows _ from the Ab-i- Istada into the Arghastan. Mount Stuart Elphinstone in his book on the “ Kingdom of KabuT” (1.809) says he heard that the low water area of this, the only lake in Afghanistan, was 3 or 4 miles in diameter, and about twice that in the flood season. The water of the lake is salt, so is that of some of the rivulets that flow to it. Charles Masson (Volume I of his “Journeys in Afghanistan, Baluchistan and the Punjab,” page 261) says that on his w r alk from Kabul to Kandahar in the summer of 1827 he passed the lakej and found its water to be shallow and so brackish that he could not drink it. On the approach to the lake the country is described as bare, but on leaving the lake well-cultivated lands were passed. A low range of hills were crossed to get to the Tarnak Valley, the water of which was also sanghin or heavy, imbued slightly 'with saline princi ple. It is evident that this area of 6,400 square miles is not an efficient feeder of the Helmand River; if there was an efficient escape the waters would not be so salt. I think, therefore, in the present state of our knowledge of the lake its drainage area should not be included in that of the Helmand basin.

Doubtless in the Secret and Confidential Records of the Government of India there are very complete accounts p{ the valleys drained by those tributaries of the Helmand, which join the river at Kala‘hBist, because these valleys were occupied by our troops in the Afghan wars of 1842 and 1880. These have not been studied, because it is certain from the published accounts of travellers that all the waters'of these rivers are consumed in irrigation, and that little or none reaches the Helmand river in the critical time of the year; it is from these rivers, small though their catchments are, that the far famed cultivation of Kandahar receives the water needed to obtain agricultural wealth from that fertile soil. General Ferrier mentions that in September 1845 the Argandab was nearly dry, being used up in artificial irrigation, and the water that was left was distinctly brackish. Charles Mason says the same of the Tarnak in the summer of 1827. The Dori Arghastan, Tarnak and Argandab contribute little to the volume of the Helmand at the time of low river in the late summer and early autumn, when water is needed to mature the high class crops of the autumn harvest and sow the wheat. Water only escapes down to the Helmand when the rains have caused floods high enough to carry away the band or weirs at the canal heads. So that if irrigation works are further extended and improved on these tributaries, they are not likely to have any appreciable effect on the critical volume of the Helmand River. In Appendix 1 of this volume is given the invaluable description written The Hazarajat or the mountain tVact drained by by Major Maitland of the Hazarajat J the the main stream of the Upper Helmand. country drained by the main stream of the Upper Helmand, and also that of the country in which the Farah Rud has its source. The upper waters of the Helmand, which furnish the invaluable late summer and early autumn supply to Seistan, drain an area of 24,121 square miles of mountainous country of an average elevation of about 10,000 feet resembling the highlands of Scotland. The mountains are covered with soil and rise in great folds presenting a sharp contrast to the bare ridges of rock with wide glacis so characteristic of the mountains on the Afghan frontier of India. The valleys of the streams and rivers are generally narrow and the further they are descended the deeper the ‘valley and the more frequent the gorges become. In the Upper part of the country the valleys are not very deep, and the hills on either side are low and well grassed in spring and summer. The whole of the Hazarajat is treeless; no forests seem to exist. The juniper, which is thickly sprinkled over many hills in most parts of Afghanistan, appears to be rare. The only trees are small willows along the streams and hefe and there some poplars. There are practically no fruit trees in all the northern part, although on the north side of the Kuh-i-Baba they are abundant. The limit of trees as well as that of permanently inhabited places is 8,000 feet of eleva tion. Fuel is obtained from small bushes and low scrub, including wormwood which grow over the hills. The soil is very fertile for so hilly a country; the crops are for the most part raised without irrigation, though there appears to be a small area of such cultivation in the valleys and glens. The higher parts are almost too cold for wheat, but barley is successfully cultivated everywhere, and the Hazaras rely on barley and pulses for their food supply. In the lower and warmer valleys beans, melons, coarse rice, maize and tobacco are raised, and fruit is grown. The climate is Very severe in winter, snow often falls at harvest, about the beginning of October, but this fall is only slight, though it may do much damage to the grain. Heavy falls take place in December, and the greater part of the country is impassable for several months ; snow lies on the ground for five months at the head waters of the river elsewhere for four months* After the melting of the snow in April there is a month or six WefekS of rain, when the clayey soil saturated with moisture renders travelling very diffi cult, and all the streams are in flood. In the summer and autumn from May or June to the end of September the climate is magnificent.

There is abun g rionV the streams and there is much cultivable land, though not much cu t.va- tionf but if the country remained undisturbed, Major Ma.tland thought cult.va- tion would increase. The valleys are generally narrow, often only a few hundred yards across, and often close into short rocky defiles ; the hills bounding the valleys are fre quently mere undulations. In the lower valleys the hills on either ^ lde are and steep. The same peculiarity, Major Maitland says, is found throughout North-Western Afghanistan. The country is treeless, with the exception of thin strips of willows and tamarisk, along the Farah Rud. This river is said to run all the way in a deep narrow vallev—a ravine with frequent gorges. The cultivation is mostly irrigated from streams, which afford abundance of water all the year round. There is also unirrigated cultivation entirely dependent on the considerable snow and rainfall. Vegetables, melons, lucerne are chiefly grown, and cotton, tobacco and fruit only in the warmer valleys. The luxuriant grass attracts the owners of flocks, herds and camels to the country from May to September. The climate in winter is severe. The first fall of snow is expected in November, and it is generally off the valleys by the end of March, but the passes are blocked till the end of April. The streams are then all in flood. Summer and autumn are delightful. Patches of snow remain on the higher hills all the year round. September is the time of the wheat harvest, and the nights begin to be frosty, but sometimes the wheat is not down till October, and is occasionally spoilt by an early fall of snow. Barley is always a fortnight earlier than wheat, as it is in Seistan as a rule. The trough of the River Helmand below Kala-i-Bist. We may now study the trough of the Helmand River; and although we have not seen the trough of the K&amp;sh, Farah and Harud Rud, yet from the accounts of travellers, who have seen them, and from the maps as well as from the descriptions obtained from Baluchis given in Appendices 32, 33 and 35 of the “ Revenue Report and Notes ” we gather that the channels of these rivers, after they leave the mountains and traverse the deserts, are very similar in all but the size of the stream to that of the Helmand River that we have seen and measured. The detailed description of the trough of the Helmand has been relegated to Appendix 2 of this volume; it will suffice to notice here the broad essential features. The river makes a great sweep on its way from the hills through the arid deserts to its termination at the bottom of this land locked basin, so much so that the direct distance from Kala-i-Bist to Tappa-i-Kohlak, near which the main stream now terminates in the Naizar is only 167 miles, whilst the distance along the river is 270 miles; it is for this reason that the Helmand River is seldom used by travellers from Seistan to Kabul or Kandahar. They usually take the short-cut up the^ Khash Rud to Khash and then across the desert to Kala-i-Bist. The inhabitants of these tracts are always ready to face a desert to save a f e 'y miles, in evidence of which are the well-marked paths that cross them in all directions. The river has cut for itself a gorge over 2 so feet deep in these ancient alluvial plains ; so narrow that its width averages only 2-kd miles over the length of too miles from Mala Khin to Bandar-i-KamM Khdm while in the 30 miles in which it enc.rcles the Kuh-i-Khdn Nashfn, the width averages only one and a quarter miles. The trough is much wider above this hill, so that the width over the who e length from Kala-i-Bist to Bandar-i-Kamdl Khdn, where the river enters its delta, is about miles. But at places the gorgeiegin to k jccasionallj ,han wheat. gh we k le accounts 5 from tie 1 35 of lk rivers, after all but tie i measure!, ,d essential hrough tie so much so which the 10 distance [id River is hey usual' e desert to lC e a desert that cross : eet deep ^ 2 .i r d miles an, while in th averages his hill f imal Khd')7 Chap. I.] widens out into bays ; the widest of these is at Hazar Juft, which may be 10 miles wide ; those above and below Khwaja Ali, Pulalak and Rudbdr are about 3 miles wide; they at present form useful sites for cultivation not fully utilised, and suggest very favourable places to construct storage reservoirs. The river flows in a channel that winds within the trough, but not very much, as the cliffs of alluvial that form the sides of the trough are very hard and constrain it to flow in a fairly straight course. The land that is culturable only averages ij miles wide along the length of 126 miles that we know best, that is, from the Kuh-i-Khan Nashin to Bandar-i-Kamdl'Kh&amp;n; above the Kuh-i- Khdn Nashfn hill for the 84 miles to Kala-i-Bist, I estimate from Doctor Bel- lew’s description* and the map on the scale of 8 miles to the inch that the average width of culturable land is probably 3 miles. The higher lying gravel covered plain or dasht within the trough that begins at Kala-i-Madar-i-Badshah, and ends at Kala Roden on the left bank, and begins at Ashkinak and extends beyond Deh Ghulam Haidar on the right bank, is not included in these figures, for it can nowhere be irrigated by the present canal systems; though situated on it are some almost shapeless mounds of ancient fortsf with moats, which could only have been filled if the river flowed at a level high enough to command this dasht } yet there is no other sign (such as canals) to shew that this plain has ever been cultivated ; all the other ruins are adjacent to or in the lower lying recent alluvial plain that is out of reach of all floods except such as that of 1885. The deep depressions to the north and south of the river near Kala * i- Ma dar- 2- Badshah. The topographical map assisted by the sections shew that as the river flows from Rudbar to Kala-i-Madar-i-Badshah, it is separated from the deep depression of the Gaud-i-Zireh on the one side and the Lallu Nawar on the other by only 5 or 6 miles of the tough alluvial through which it has cut itself a trough. The water of the river is 260 feet above the bed of the Gaud-i-Zireh to the south, and 173 feet above the Lallu Nawar to the north. In the scarp of the Gaud-i-Zireh there are two small springs ; the upper one is called Oruk Pitok and the lower Chah-i-Oruk; doubtless these springs are fed from the river, as they are only 7 miles away, and the upper one is 185 feet below the level of the water in the river and the lower one 237 feet. There is no reason to apprehend that the river could by any circumstance find its way into either of these depressions. The wear of ages denuding the scarp on either side has met at the ridge, and the denudation has lowered the pass at these places below the general level of the alluvial plateaux; nevertheless the width at the water surface of the river between river and basin is still several miles of very hard alluvial which could only be pierced with immense labour and skill. The people said there was a kariz from Puza-i-Mashi towards Dik-i-Firuza to the south of Sar-o-tar, and the gallant Khan Bahadur Shaikh Mohi-ud-din was said to have been tracing it on his fatal march from the river. He had with him the man, whose father, the old Naib of Chatdr Burjak, professed to have seen it. The old Arbab Saif-ud-din also said he had seen it, but we could find no trace of it. It is quite within the possible that the ancients attempted to make such a kariz. Even at this day Sardar Muhammad Razd Khdn, Sanjardni, of Chahar Burjak is ar- t Appendix 27 of the “ Revenue Report and ranging tO open Out Chah-i-Oruk| with Notes •” a view to cultivating some land on the talus of the cliff; there is an element of danger in this proceeding, as a draw on the well might cause the spring to develop in size, but it would take generations for such a spring to develop a dangerous draw. * Doctor Eellew has written two accounts of his journey down the Helmand with General Pollock in 1872—one to the public. From the Indus to the Tigris ; the other is among the Government of India Secret records. f One of these almost shapeless mounds with a moat is below Deh Ghulam Haidar, that is below the head of the Taraku trough. It is on this highlying dasht, as this dasht does not end for a few miles further down the river. It is not certain that it also extended down the Trakli trough. There are higher lying plateaux in that trough above Kala-i-Kharan, but they are intersected by ancient canals, so may be of a different age. The canals are so ancient that the pebbles in the banks are as black as those on the plateau. Kala-i-Kharan is a very ancient structure on the high plateau on the right bank of the river. It is a star shaped fort and the walls are pierced with passages slanting downwards through which projectiles could be shot on those who approached. Some of these openings are two feet high and a foot wide.[Chap. I. The fall of the river. The levels taken give v«y coatee Informajon of ^ by its -ve.. distnbuunes These levels shew the fall at low river, at the great flood of 1903, ahd the extraordinary flood of 1885, as well as the slope when the river was in high flow fn June ,903. Above Puza-i-Mdshi Doctor Bellew's aneroid barometer obser vations indicate that the river follows the laws of all such rivers and the fall in feet per mile increases as the river is ascended towards its source. e all m feet per mile below Bandar-i-Kamal Khan is not much if any greater than that in the Punjab rivers, which are navigated by the large flat bottomed boats but above Bandar-i-Kamal Khan the average fall soon increases to about 2-5 teet a tmle, and it is probable that above Khwaja Ali it soon becomes three feet a mile on the average. In addition to the longitudinal slope of the river much information has also been Collected of the mean velocity in the river at different stages, more especi* ally at low river, and at each of the floods in 1904* J 9*^3 an d 1885 ; these are given on the sheets on which the discharges were calculated and the results are abstracted out into the Statement at the end of Chapter VIII. The flood dis- charges were calculated in favourable reaches of the river; the observations shew that for each flood the velocity does not vary much in the_ trough of the river; though, as was to be expected, there is a big drop in velocity when the water has got well out into the delta; this is shewn by the details given at Kala-i-Gawak and at the Band-i-Seistdn. The floods on the Helmand do not last long, so it is the slopes and veloci ties at low river which will most concern those who are interested in its navi gableness. The velocities quoted are of course those obtained from the flood and other discharge observations which) as has just been said) are made at favourable places. So the longitudinal section should be studied to see the sort of rapids which must be negociated. There is a conspicuous one at Guzar- i-Nasir, half way between Chahar Burjak and Kalad-Roden; the slope from Guzard-Nasir to Kala-i-Roden is 5'6 feet a mile over a length of nearly 3 miles. This is the stiffest part of the river levelled over by us. Such places must be expected to be more frequent as the river is ascended. This report has no direct concern with navigation, so that the engineer who wishes for in formation on this subject should carefully examine the sheets of longitudinal sections of the river to see if information of value to him can be got from thenn The Helmand River has never been known to become dry at the head of the Rudbdr Canal, but in the hottest part of July, August and perhaps early in Sep tember of^ 1902 there was only water enough at Puldlak to feed the Rudbar Canal. 1 his would only be about 5° ° r 60 cUseCs, and not enough to navigate the river. The year 1905 ^ as a ^ r y ^ ne when the volume at the hand fell to 300 cusefcs about, or about One-quarter of the normal volume. In such a year the river would probably not be navigable below Chahar Burjak during the hottest days of July and August and perhaps for a week or ten days of Sep tember i The material df the river bed. From Bandar.i-Kam^l Khdn upwards the river bed is formed of a very deep layer of gravel and boulders, which overlies the alluvial out of which the trough has been cut. This material will form an admirable foundation for a weir and be pear y if not quite water-tight like the gravel and boulder bed on which the h V-r na u R L Ver t isbuilt - .

From Appendix 25 of the “ Revenue Report and Notes ” it would appear that in the great flood of 1885 a large mass of material was deposited below Bandar-i-Kamal Khan, as well as at Puza-i-Mashi, so as to raise the bed doubt less the cause at the latter place was the enlargement of the flood section below Ziarat Panja Kash as the river spreads out over the low lands at the head of the Chahdr Burjak Canal, and at the former place the enlargement of section by the water spreading out down the Taraku trough. The channel of the Helmand River above Bandar-i-Kam&amp;l Khan is likely to prove an ideal place to construct hydraulic works. The foundations appear excellent, and the material sufficient. The only difficulty that can be foreseen, as likely to occur, is to get fuel; this will be fully dealt with in Chapter XI. S644FD Cio CHAPTER II. CONTENTS. The delta of the Helmand River.

The levels taken during the stay of the Mission in Seistdn have been plott- The contoured map. ? d , 0n 0n f of ‘ he m ?P s Scale of one inch to the mile; with this information the contours have been drawn in, so far as it was possible ; from this map they have been transferred to the map on the scale of 4 miles to the inch, which is also coloured to^ shew the tracts into which the country is divided from an irrigation point of view {vide Statement H). While studying this map and the^ statement of areas it may be useful to notice that the extreme length of the basin containing the deltas of all the rivers, ancient and modern, from north to south, is 140 miles, while its width from east to west is 80 miles. The water of the Hamun when at full flood level extends along 40 miles of the north-east boundary, 50 miles of the north boundary and 100 miles of the west boundary. The Gaud-i-Zireh is 70 miles from east to west and less than 20 miles from north to south. The colours and the contours on the map alike draw attention to the main The high plateaux or dasht .features of the country. The high un- commandable plateaux coloured dark red on the map lie on either bank of the Rud-i-Sena, and rise nearly aoo feet above the present cultivated tract; they are alluvial plains on which old river beds can be traced; from the left bank of the Helmand River between Bandar-i-Kamal Khan and the Band-i-Seistan the highest plateau is reached in a series of terraces, each about 30 feet higher than the one below. There are deep depres sions in these plateaux, whose origin can only be guessed at and whose value for irrigation works will be dealt with in Chapter XVI. Thedower parts of these plateaux coloured brown on the map could be The uncommandabie plateau. commanded by specially constructed, very expensive high level canals, as described at the end of Chapter XIII. The only attempt at irrigation in the past that can be The Rud-i.Sena Canal. f ° Und 00 the 7 1 is 3 canal down th 6 bed of the Rud-i-Sena whose bed was kept high up out of the bottom of the trough ; the object of the canal seems to have been to cultivate in the trough of the Rud-i-Sena and in some depressions to the south of ’Aliabad, Sihkuha and Warmal. There are no remains of human habitations along this canal, and there is much about it that would indicate that it was never opened. It is interesting to notice that the great flood of 1885 would have poured a volume down the Rdd-i-Sena, had not the spoil banks of this old canal, which are massive because the canal is in cutting, closed the entrance to the deep channel of the trough. Some water found its way for a short distance down the canal, but its volume was small, as the canal is not cap able of carrying more than 100 to 200 cusecs. The river spill eventually all drained back to the river in the neighbourhood of the place where it left it. South of Kabr-i-Haji on the left bank of the river opposite Kala-i-Fath is an The Yak6b. ancient canal noticed by Dr. Bellew and called by him Yakdb which also seemed designed to irrigate in a depression or old river bed running parallel and to the west of the present river. Its bed is very high above that of the present river, but its head reach has probably been cut away just as that of the canal in the Rud-i-Sena has been.12 [Chap. II. south o, ,h.

River above Bandar-i-Kamal Khan. The appearance of its bed is that of a channel suddenly deserted by the river; there is no contraction or obliteration of the section of the channel such as would occur if the stream was slowly diverted from the channel m the same way that it has been slowly diverted from the Nad-i-Ah Channel. The old channel on the left bank below Kala-i-Madar-i-Padshah must have been suddenly deserted in the same way ; but there is not necessarily any connection between the two channels ; that is, they need not form part of a channel that was in flow at the same time. The delta of the Rud-i-Tarakii is of great interest, being covered with the Traces of man on this delta from pakeolothic sites of Villages that date back tO the IHOSt times. primitive times; palaeolithic implements are also found at Nalukhi near Gird-i-Chah, Chah Aladdd close to boundary pillar No. 22, the Surdaghal, near boundary pillar No. 30, Shah-i-Mardan, Pas Kunaki, Dik Inari, a place about 9 miles east of Chdh Aladad. The wind has scoured the alluvial off wide areas of this delta, so that much of it is now covered with the usual extremely thin layer of gravel, but at Nalukhi the stone implements were found on the top of an alluvial mound that has not been scoured away, so some of the most ancient parts of the alluvial must still remain. In the Surdaghal between boundary pillars No. 28 and 32 there is a lake basin with bar and beach on its leeshore ; its bottom is at about the level of the bed of the H&amp;mun-i-Kuh-i-Khwdja immediately to the west. This part of the tract is very rough and broken from the scouring effects of the wind, as may be seen from photographs taken by the Mission, but it can be quite easily irrigated and cultivated. The people say that the tract around Macchi and Hauzdar which is very The Macchi Hauzdar tract. level and regular was cultivated up to about one hundred or so years ago. The ruins at these places and at Ziarat Shah-i-Mardan, Ramnid, etc., are of com paratively recent origin. Hauzdar itself is a roughly built place much in the style of the present walled city of Seistan and must be the most modern of all these ruins. Parts of Ramrud must be much more ancient. The traditions say that as late as the time of Malik Bahram Khan, Kaydni, a canalf was opened f Mr. Tate has made a study of the manuscripts ^ Tnraku trough. The and traditions of this canal.

This would indicate that the water of the Helmand was diverted down this channel up to about a century ago. This could have been done only by a temporary or weir renewed annually and placed somewhere between Kala-i-Mir and Bandar-i-Kamal Khan m much the same way as water is now sent down the Riid-i-Seistan from a point on the river at or above Kala-i-Kiihak.

II.] , 13 must periodically get out of control, and either by an accident, or by the act of some vandal, the river deserts the cultivated tract and rushes down into some deserted tract, where it remains till the silt it deposits has raised its bed so high that it again gets out of control. We may pause here to reflect that when the river first breaks into a new channel its bed is so low that water is with difficulty diverted over the land, and much w'ater flows to w r aste to the lake, but when it has raised its bed high the water is easily diverted over the land and cultivation expands. Seist&amp;n seems to have arrived at one of the latter periods in its history and we may expect an expansion of cultivation. The canals that supplied water to the cultivation around Sar-o-tdr, where traced up to an old river bed just to the heSar-o-tar eta. south of the plateau or to the south east of Kala-i-Gawak and the north-east of Deh Dost Muhammad. At the times of the prosperity of Sar-o-tar the river flowed at a higher level past Dam- i-Kalan until it reached this high isolated plateau of alluvial and then a channel like that of the Rud-i-Seistdn of the present day took off and went out into the tract, that is now covered by the sand-hills ; here canals were given off one to each tract now represented by an ancient ruin of considerable size with its sub sidiary smaller ruins ; the home of the overlord and those of his kadkhuda, the more imaginative of the people say, who have instincts for antiquarian research. But the tract around Sar-o-tar has three distinct classes of ruins, ancient almost shapeless mounds to which the names of the elder heroes of Persian romance Sam, Zal and Rustam are given ; ruins having heavy walls built of mud consolidated in situ {pise) ; these have the names of the younger heroes, Faramuz, Burzu, etc.; buildings with openings for light and air where the owner could sit to enjoy the prospect; these are named after Raja Sispal, whom tradi- * Vide page 9 of Chapter! of the “Revenue tion* Says Was the_SOn of a Delhi king, who Report and Notes ” Mr. Tate has traced this to a c ame here With his knights having Hindu Parthian origin 1702 years ago, but which of these -pi • j u ■ 1^0' ' o set of ruins are of that age has yet to be worked Rajput names and DUllt Sar-O-tar.

The river must have come down into this tract more than once and deserted it again. The tract is now cut off from the river by high very dense sand-hills that must have been here in the times when Kala-i-Fath became the capital, because the canals that lead to all the big and comfortable built buildings around t So-called because the high wall to the windward Palangi.f which are associated with that has open brick air spaces arranged so as to repre- period of Seistan prosperity, Stop short at sent, diagramatically, a leopard. these san d.hill S , and the people who lived at Palangi seem not to have taken any more interest in the tract beyond the sand-hills than those of the present day. In the great flood of 1885 water escap ed from the river near Dam-i-Kalan into the wind scours around these ruins, but did not penetrate the sand-hills. A high ridge of ancient river-beds runs from Puza-i-Kala-i-Fath past Dam-i-Kalan to Kala-i-Gawak; this was breached in one or two places by the flood of 1885. There is a conspicuous old river-bed that passes down from the neighbour hood of Palangi past Ziarat Sheikh Husain and Paisai, and loses itself in the sand-hills, that is, could not be properly traced any further. There are also many conspicuous depressions or ndwar to the south of Sar-o-tar and the south-west of Dik-i-Khurma, also called Dikd-Firuza : the plain to the east of Sar-o-tar is white, flat, level and bare of ruins as well as of sand, and there are some conspicuous nawar here too. The Naizdr and Upper Hamun of the times when the river terminated in this part of the Delta must have been under the cliffs which form the south-eastern boundary of the basin. When we rode to the Lallu Nawar in August 1903 we had not had training in picking up old beaches, which certainly must exist here. There were many features in the country which were probably old beaches. It would be interesting to compare them with those in the Surdaghal near boundary pillar No. 30 to see which are the more recent. Tradition says that the country was very rich agriculturally, and the sumptuousness of the ruins testifies to this fact. The present cultivated tract was then most probably a desert and the sand from this desert was blown over the Sar-o-tar tract and fertilised it. Now all this fertile sand is blown out into the deserts of the Dasht-i- Margo, and is lost for ever. S644FD*4 [Chap.

The slope of the country from salient points on the river to the depressions. We may now usefully study the contoured map and calculate the fall in feet per mile of the country from salient points on the river to the nearest deep part ofthe basin at which the main stream has at some time terminated. Such salient points are the present site ofthe Band-i-Seistan, Kala-i-Gawak where there are many ancient bifurcations of the river, Dam-i-Kalan, the neighbourhood from which the old river channels went off towards Paisi and Sar-o-tar, Dik-i-Dila, the head of the Riid-i-Sena, Bandar-i-Kamdl Khan, the head of the ancient Taraku river. This study will shew in what direction the slope to the bed of the basin is greatest; this will be a guide to the length oi time the river \s likely to remain in that tract if it once breaks into it. But it should be borne in mmd that it is not the greatness of this slope that determines the direction in which the river will next break away, but its high level relative to some trough close by. This aspect of the study will be dealt with more in detail at the end of this Chapter. From the Band-i-Seistan along the old Helmand and Sikhsar to Deh Ali Jangi (Boundary Pillar No. 62) the average fall is under 2 feet a mile; from the same place to Tappa-i-Kakha, where the main river now terminates, the fall is only one and three-quarters of a foot a mile, but it is greater to the chung around Tappa-i-Kohlak for which the main stream is now making. From the band to the Naizar at Adimi the fall is about 2 feet a mile, and to the depressions at Afzalabad it is rather more. The fall per mile is much the same from the band to Meno on the south-west shore of the Chung-i-Dardzgu. From Kala-i-Gawak there is a rapid fall to the north-east to Masite of about 3'3 feet a mile, and to the Chung-i-Darazgu the ultimate destination of the water of two and a quarter feet a mile. This is one of the smartest falls in the country ; yet it is not so long ago that the main Herat invaded Seistan the river was in this channel. TlVCr IlOU ed^ down the ohela-1-JharUKly tO the Chung-i-Darazgu, and continued to send spills in that direction, so that the thick bed of bulrushes {tut) survived till after the flood of 1903. It is not easy to see why the river left this bed, perhaps the outfall from the Chung-i-Darazgu to the Hamun-i-Puzak is small and the water is held back ; but more probably the river breached into a lower depres sion that lead it to the basin past Burj-i-As. In 1903 the flood water extended to the south-east of the Zorkan Canal (for details see our 2 inches to the mile sketch maps). From Dam-i-Kalan to the depression east of Sar-o-tar the fall is about 2*3 feet a mile \ the breach made by the flood of 1885 in the sharp ridge already referred to is considered a very dangerous place by the Akhunzada Fakir Muhammad, Hakim of Chakhansur ; the strange thing is that these breaches are never closed or made secure. ^ The high plateau to ^the east of Kala-i-Gawak and the sand belt limii the direction in which the river could escape to the de pression past Ziarat Shaikh Husain and Paisai. From Dik-i-Dila down the Sena Rud to the 1,620 contour of the country atound Ahabad the average fall is about 2 feet a mile, and from there to the Hamun about the same.] 5 Chap. II.] From Bandar-i-Kamal Khan down the Taraku trough to the Barmin at the head of the Sar-i-Shela the average fall is a little over 2 feet a mile, and down the Rud-i-Kuchk to the Gaud-i Zireh it is over 3-5 feet a mile on the average, this channel corresponds to the channel the Rud-i-Farah has got into, the velo city in which is so great that the channel is scoured out thirty feet deep in places ; for details see plans connected with Longitudinal Section No. IX, and Appendix 33 of “ Revenue Report and Notes. M The action of a flood m opening a new channel. The great flood of 1885 poured a volume* of over one lakh of cusecs down the Rud-i-Taraku Channel for many days (see detailed description in Appendix 25 of the “ Revenue Report and Notes ”). The Akhunzada Fakir Muhammad, Hakim of Chakhansur, says that the river did not re-open this channel, because the flood was so thick with mud that the water had no scouring power; this no doubt is quite correct for this occasion; the flood rose to an extraordinary height and the flow down the channel was cut off suddenly while the water was still thick, but this would not always be the case. In his report on Mesopotamia (see extract in Appendix 4). Sir William Willcocks has pointed out that the Euphrates and Tigris floods are also very thick at the height of the flood and afterwards the water rapidly becomes clear. Our measurements of the silt carried by the water of the Helmand shew the same, see Chapter IX of this Re port. The people say that during the flood of 1885 a heavy deposit of shingle occurred in the main stream below the Taraku outlet; there is ample evidence of this in the channel now (see Appendix 25 of the “Revenue Report and Notes”); such a deposit is bound to occur on such an occasion ; we watched it at Shah- gul in the flood of 1903 wide plans and sections made of Bi/urcations No. XLIII to L). We see, therefore, how a river may open out a new channel during a big flood in spite of the fact that the water at high flood is so laden with silt that the water has no scouring power ; during this part of the flood a heavy deposit of material is thrown down below the outlet; this bar diverts much of the water of the river down the outlet, when the water becomes clear, as it does when the flood subsides, scouring goes on down the new channel that is opened, and the supply down the old channel is much reduced. The Helmand River usually remains high and clear after the big rain flood of spring with its burden of silt has passed away, because the snow water has to be run off; this river should therefore be more prone to open out new channels during the flood season than rivers not fed so freely from the melting snows. It should be borne in mind that the bed of a distributary of a river in its delta rises steadily by the silt deposited; the change of channel is therefore originally due to the rise of level of the old channel making it possible for the water to break away down a new and lower channel; a new distributary cannot be formed by scour till the old distributary has obtained command over the bed of the newly to be formed distributary. The artificial works of man largely control the direction of the flow of the The action of artificial works on channels in the river, the annual Construction of band OY delta - weirs have a great influence on the disposi tion of the main stream by raising the level of the river above the hand ; they also force silt laden flood water down the distributary they are built to feed and so gradually raise the tract of country. The river is constrained by protection embankments to follow a certain course; but in time these works become very large and the greatest watchful ness and skill is needed to maintain them. The old channels past great ruins have formed narrow ridges that are high above the present country ; such are the ridges that go down to Takht-i-Shah, the great ridge past Kaud-i-Gaz 4 miles to the east of the boundary and opposite Tappa-i-Talai and Kurki which is covered with ruins, the great ridges that come from the Farah Rud towards Tappa-i-Kharan. From the banks of the Sikhsar at Gulshah one looks across the valley covered with big tamarisk to the ridge that passes Karku Shah: there are many other such ridges all testifying to the success with which administrations in the past held the distributaries of the river to their duty of fertilising the lands on which their properties were built. * In the time of Sardar Kamal Khan embankments had to be hastily constructed to keep the river from going down the trough, and destroying his cultivation at Kala-i-Afzal, although the people realize the great danger of the river going down the trough, they have not closed it off with an embankment which 500 men could make in a week. The present bed of the main river is about R. L. 1,710-00 while that of the Taraku trough is at R. L. 1,725 for about a mile ; beyond that there is a rapid fall in the bed. The flood of 1903 rcse to R. L. 1,726 and was only per- vented from going down by the sand-hills.V CHAPTER III. CONTENTS. The inundated area.

The whole of the area liable to inundations divides itself naturally into four . , . main basins— The main basins. (i) The eastern basin is the-Hdmun-i-Puzdk with its Naiz£r and flooded lands. (ii) The northern basin or Hdmun-i-Sabari with its Naiz 4 r and flooded lands. (iii) The southern basin or Hdmun-i-Kuh-i-Khwaja with its flooded lands and a very limited area of Naiz&amp;r. (iv) The south-eastern basin or Gaud-i-Zireh this includes the Sar-i-Shela* and the lands on its fan in the depression. In Appendices No, 22 to 28 of the “ Revenue Report and Notes” , . a detailed description of the inundated The ridges that separate the basms . area is given ; and in Chapter XLVII, on the roads across the inundated area, it is explained that this area consists of two characteristic classes of flooded lands, viz .; Naizdr, or reed marshes in which lie the patches of open water or Chung x and the large sheets of open water or Hamiin. In the same Chapter it is explained how the Hamun-i-Puzakf is separated from the Hdmun-i-Sabari by the ridge which is crossed by the road from Seistdn to Herat called the Rah-i-Mesh Kushi, and the Hamun-i-Sabari is separated from the Kuh-i-Khwdja Hamun by the ridge which is crossed by the road from Seistan to Meshed called the Rah-i- Gardowak, while the Kuh-i-Khwaja Hdmun is separated from the channel of the Sar-i-Shela by the ridge which is crossed by the road to Nasratabad Ispi, Bam and Kirman that crosses from Regowak or Tump-i-Mir Dost to Turshdb. f This H 5 mun is probably separated from the Chung-i-Darazgu by a ridge formed by the Khash Riid across which the road from Nad-i-Ali to the north-east crosses the Naizdr, but we have not levelled this crossing. There is probably a ridge between the Chung-i-Darazgu and the Hdmun of Sdr-o-tdr referred to in the footnote of this page. This ridge is formed by the outfall of the Shand that drains the Dasht-i-Margo. The Sar-i-Shela receives the overflow from the Kuh-i-Khawja Hamun and delivers it into the Gaud-i-Zireh which is the final receptacle for the waters of all the rivers, but in 20 years out of 30 the upper basins are able to contain all the water that comes down in flood and none overflows down the Sar i-Shela; of the remaining ten years one is usually a year of great flood in which the over flow fills the Gaud-i-Zireh to some depth, while in the remaining nine years the overflow does not suffice to replace losses and so keep water in the basin. The basin was probably dry from the year 1868 till the flood of 1877 came down. It was probably dry in 1883 and 1884. The extraordinary flood of 1885 put so much water into the basin that it lasted till about 1898, since then the basin has been dry, with the exception of the deeper pools in the bed of the channels of the Sar-i-Shela, which were replenished by the flood of 1903 and still hold water. So that we see that, for at least 15 years out of 30, the bed of the Gaud-i-Zireh is dry. fc^The Seistani always describes the Sar-i-Shela down to the Cardan Reg Ford as a basin; we could not understand how this could be till we had levelled along the channel and found that in big floods the water surface down to Cardan Reg (near boundary pillar No. 12) is almost level with that in the Kiih-i-Khwaja Hamun just as the Seistani dascribes it to be. The knowledgeable Seistani in these descriptions always distinguishes the Gaud-i-Zireh Hamun from the Pir Kisri Hamun. He says the latter is the deepest and is filled from the former by a flow past Oruk. But we could not investigate this in detail. When the river flowed towards Sar-o*tar there must have been an H 5 mun in the broad area that we saw free of sand-hills and of buildings all along the base of the cliffs of the Dasht-i-Margo. Most probably the conspicuous large Nawar near Dik-i-Firuza (also called Dik-i-Khurma) under the cliffs to the south of the Sar-o-tar ruins was also filled with flood water in those times. The bed of the Lallu Nawar {viz., R.L. 1,537) seems too high to have been a part of this Hamun for the outfall at Amiran is only about 1,525 ; the ruins, it is true, are all outside contour 1,540, yet it seems hardly possible that water could have stood so high above the levels of the Puzak Hamun.

T„ „„~ The state of the inundated area at the end of 1902. we understood the problems to be solved and had the leisure to collect the information some very useful re cords could have been secured. But we were not able to start our investigations until it became known that the Mission would remain on in Seistdn, by that time the flood had filled the Hamlin, and it was already rapidly subsiding. But many useful measurements were nevertheless recovered and very complete cal- dilations will be given in Chapter XV on the filling and emptying of these basins. The inundated area was practically dry {vide Appendix 24 of the “ Revenue Report and Notes”) when the flow from the river to the Hdmun began towards the end of 1902. The water reached the Band-i*Seistan at the end of Septem ber and was in such strong flow that it quickly reached places so far-off as the City and Burj-i-As (see Chapter L of the “ Revenue Report and Notes.”) Early in December the band was carried away, and the volume of the river afterwards remained so large that there was ample water in all the distributaries for the irrigation of all lands, and there must have been a considerable overflow into the Naizar. At the end of March when we visited Tappa-i-Kharan there was open water , , to be seen in the chimp at the tail of the Th. .tat. oi ih. th, .pn»g o! ,903. RM . i .p ariin&gt; and the water had begun to flow towards the Shela-i-Mesh Kushi on its way to the Hamun-i-Puzak, and there must have been a good flow towards the Sabari Hamun, though no water could be seen there. At the end of April the view from the Kuh-i-Chaco over the inundated area shewed a sheet of water as far as the eye aided by glasses could see. We will now take up the detailed description of the rise of the flood in each Hdmun*i-Puzak. , beginning with the eastern basin or Hdmun-i-Puzdk. This basin receives direct all the flood water of the Khdsh Rud, Khar Rud, Khuspas Rud, and some spill by the Rud-i-Banduki from the Rud-i-Fanih {vide Appendix 33 of the “ Revenue Report and Notes”). In addition the waters of the Helmand reach it from two main directions (i) from the overflow of the channels at the tail of the Rud- i-Nad-i- Ali and the Shela-i-Jharuki (in 1903), which flow in from the south-west, ana (ii) from the Rud-i-Parian by the Shela*i-Mesh Kushi, which enters from the north-west. The first is a direct flow, but the second flow does not begin till a large area of Naizar at the tail of the Rud-i-Parian has been inundated {vide Appendix 22 of the “ Revenue Report and Notes ”). The water began to flow into the Hamun-i-Puzak through the Shela-i-Mesh Kushi on the 23rd of April and continued till the 3rd of May ; on this date the Hamun-i-Puzak must have reached its full flood level of 1,604-7. The flow then revei se anc or 20 days the current set from the east to the west and then stopt. This Shela was not fordable from the 3rd to the 18th of May, which thl f. t '? le the n^mun-i-Puzak must have stood at its full flood rfrv on tho^i^nth'T^ ^ u a b^ e the shela.

L. 1,6047 (m 1903) and the Hamun-i-Sabari was at some level like 1,602*00 A study of the contours on Plan LI 1 I (one mile to an inch) and the sections along the line of flow Nos. XI-XII and the descriptions in Appendix 22 of the “ Revenue Report and Notes ” will make this clear : so that during the time that the flow reversed it is probable that the Sdbari Hamun was not up to its full flood level of 1,603*2 or else the water in this neighbourhood would have been too high to permit^ any flow from the Hamun-i-Puzdk at R. L. 1,604*7, In making the calculations in Statement C, Table 6, we have assumed that connection between the waters east and west of the ridge* ceased on the 1 sth June. J . It be noticed that water is transferredf across the ridges from, one basin to another, and that the basins are only simultaneously full to flood level for a very short time, if ever at all. Turning now to the Rah-i-Gardowak, where the overflow from the northern The Hdmdn-i-Sabari. basin to the southern basin takes place. On the 28th April we crossed the Rah-i- Gardowak in the dry; there was a small flow through the Rud-i-Shor of a few hundred cusecs only. I he level of the Northern Hamun must then have been about_ R. L. 1,601. On the Sth May we returned and crossed the Rah-i-Tiratki m Min. The general level of the ground of the bed of the Rah-i-Tiratki is 1,598, and there w r as aoout 3 feet or 3^ feet of water over this. The flow over the Rah-i- Gardowak was too much fordoaded camels to cross, but unloaded camels were able to get across. About the 15th May the depth of water over the Rah-i-Gardowak became sufficient for the tutw to be transferred from the Rah-i-Tiratki to the Rah-i-Gardowak. This would be when the flodd reached its full height at reduced level 1,603 2, when the depth of water would be 5 feet on the Rah-i-Tiratki and about 3 feet on the Rah-i-Gardowak. The former road being abandoned, not only because the depth was uncomfortably deep for poling tutiu and too deep to lead horses, but because the Lurga-i-Tiratki, where the landing on the western shore is made, becomes flooded and impassable. So that the flow from the Northern Hamun to the Southern began about the 20th of April, but it did not develop into a considerable flow till about the 10th of May, and by the 15th May it was so large as to prevent any further rise of the w r aters in the Northern Hamun. We have just seen that the Hamun-i- Puzak was also at full flood level about this time; the Hamun-i-Puzak w r as em ptying into the Sabari, and the Sabari was discharging over the ridge at the Rdh- i-Gardowak. ^ When the volume poured over the ridge equals the volume poured into the basin to the north of it less the losses by evaporation and absorption the Northern Hamun ceases to rise, and there is a transfer of water from the north to the south of this road. Thus, when the Hamun to the north of the ridge is full to flood level, it does not necessarily follow that the Hamun to the south of the ridge is also full, as flood water is transferred across the ridge from one Hamun to the other. The Hamun-i-Sabari remained at its full flood level for about a month or six weeks and then began to subside. In Table 6 of Statement C it is assumed that the fall began on the 10th July. The connection between the waters north and south of the Rah-i-Gardowak, The end of the flood season. 0T . the rid g e al ° n g which the telegraph wire to Meshed crosses, was broken about the 15th September, the level of the waters of the Hamun-i-Sabari being then only R.

The Rud-i-Shor across this ridge became dry about the middle of October 1,903, and loaded baggage animals were able to cross in the dry. 1 he road was therefore closed for traffic by flood w 7 aters from the end of April till the middle of October. * This ridge is the crossing of the road from Seistan to Herat on the Shela-i-Mesh Kushi. t The saiyads and gaodars drew our attention to this fact on our first visit to the Hdmun in April IQcn.

But on the 6th September all the pools down to the boundary crossing near Cardan Reg had already become too salt to drink, though a week before They were fresh. The great length of time these pools retain water is des cribed in Chapter VI of this Report. The Gaud-i-Zireh was dry during our stay in Seistdn, but the observations recorded by Sir Charles MacGregor (1877), The valuable information collected by travellers. ^ Merk Colonel Y ate (1894) and Colonel McMahon (1896) fill up great blanks in our knowledge and will be of the utmost value to engineers should any works ever be constructed on the Helmand. Their visits fortunately hit off critical periods, and with the knowledge we got from the people during our stay in Seistan, has enabled us to complete our calculations for this basin. These will be dealt with in Chapter VI on evapora tion and in Chapter XV on drainage. It has been stated in the footnote of the first page of this Chapter that c . c , . , „ , „ the Baluchis explained to us how the Sar- i-bhela to Cardan Reg (the boundary crossing) was also a deep Hamun; this fact they knew from their experience in big floods ; but w r e could only ascertain it by levelling. The ultimate overflow from the upper basins to the Gaud-i-Zireh takes place at Cardan Reg because the bed of the Sar-i-Shela has cut back nearly level for a distance of 15 miles above the boundary crossing. But at the head of the Sar-i-Shela near Tump- i-Mir Dost there is a ridge which acts as a weir crest to regulate the overflow of water from the Kuh-i-Khwaja Hamun into this long level channel of the Sar-i- Shela. Tliis very important feature of the inundated area will be readily realized by examining the sections and very complete surveys that have been made of this part, as of all the other critical parts of the inundated area. The bed of the Sar-i-Shela is scoured out at every big flood and is torn up and gouged out into deep holes throughout its length. Its narrowmess and depth causes the velocity to be very high. In the flood of 1885 the mean velocities rose to 6 5 feet per second, or over 4 miles per hour. 2he mam lines of flow. The foregoing descriptions of the floods of 1903 will explain how the floods From the river to the Sabari Harman. are transferred from one basin to another ., . , ... , ^7 overflows at the separating ridges; aiese ridges as the plans will shew are broad comparatively high areas of land21 Chap. III.] that have been formed right across the basins by the fans of rivers on the op posite shore meeting the fan of the Helmand. But there is also a well-defined internal system of flow by which the waters from the Helmand travel before the whole area is flooded and the overflow by the ridges occurs, and even then these lines carry the main current. These lines of flow have been described in great detail in Appendix 22 of the f&lt; Revenue Report and Notes they have been drawn on the quarter inch Plans X and XI and Sections Nos. X to XI 11 have been made along them. These lines of flow are liable to alter slightly each year due to slight changes in the direction in which the main stream tails into the inundated area, and to very big changes after the lapse of years when important changes have occurred. At the present time the main stream of the river outfalls by the Riid-i-Paridn at Shela-i-Tutigah to the west of Tappa-i-Kakha, where there is a sudden fall of 5 feet in the water surface. At this place the water is dispersed by three lines of flow, the main line going to the north-west to the Hdmun-i-Sabari through the Chung-i-Gardan Reg, Hamun-i-Zainal and escaping through the beach on the leeward shore of the Hamun by the Aukan-i-Shib, a narrow deep cut made by the escaping waters (Section No. XXXIIIC). This flow continued throughout the period of low river of 1904-05. The second line of flow goes more directly west through Shela-i-Dehno, Shela-i-Chashmaka, through the deep Hamun-i-Husain Madaki, and thence through Chung-i-Garundgi to join the outflow of the Sabari Hamun in the Chung-i-Dardz (Section No. XIII). This line of flow starts after the first line of flow. The third line of flow is north-east towards the Puzdk Hamun (Section No. XI) through Chung-i-Baringak. From Chung-i-Baringak there is a flow towards the Sabari Hamun (Section No. XII) through Aukan-i-Gamshad, Aukan-i-Gulga*' lak and Chung-i-Saruni, and into the Hamun-i-Sabari through the Aukan-i-Bala. This flow starts before the water of the Helmand reaches the Puzak Hamun through the Shela-i-Mesh Kushi (Section No. XI). The detailed plans made in 1905 on a scale of one inch to a mile shew that these lines of flow are through lands overgrown by dense thickets of reeds, bul rushes and rushes, and that the water flows at times along channels {shela) and at others through wide shallow pools {chung) } the flow being obstructed by the local high ridges in the beds of these channels, or the entrance or exits of the pools. There is a similar series of channels lying between the Chung-i-Darazgu, the extreme south-eastern receptacle of the Khash waters, and those escaping from the Helmand through the Shela-i-Jharuki or from the main river by the old chan nels that leave it near the head of the Sultani Canal; we have no detailed surveys of these channels ; the area was practically dry in January 1905 ; it would have been very tedious and difficult to trace them out and map them without enough water to shew the levels. But a study of the information that has been mapped will shew exactly what must be expected in that part of the basin. The Sabari Hamun has thrown up a great beach on its south-eastern shore along which the road from Adimi over the From the Sabari Hamun to the south. Lurga-i-Tesha Kani and Buz Kushta to Dahana-i-Farah Rud goes {vide last page but one page of chapter xlvii of the “ Revenue Report and Notes).” Near the southern end of this beach the waters have made a series of deep broad channels by which they escape towards the Hamun-i-Kuh-i-Khwaja; these are the Rud-i-Gharut Khwar and the Shela-i- Charaka Bala. The deep Hamun to the north of the Custom’s post at Bahring is in a pocket or back water and the flow of the escaping water leaves it far to the west. From the Chung-i-Daraz where the waters that come from the Hamun-i-Sabari (Section No. X) and from the Shela-i-Dehno (Section No. XIII) meet, the flow is through a series of pools to the ridge over which the telegraph line crosses; across this there are three shallow depressions called the (I) Shor Rud, the one to the west which drains first, the (II) Shela-i-Gardo, and the (III) Shela-i-Khwaja ’Ali. In the flood of 1903 the waters crossed this ridge in a sheet 3 feet deep and 12 miles wide, and in 1885 the depth was 7 feet and the width 16 miles. S644FD32 [Chap.

The wind has a great influence on the circulation of the water in the inun- 5 dated area, not only by increasing the eva. The action of the wind. porating power of the sun and so lowering its level but by driving it before it down the channels of flow; while doing this it spreads the water out over the shallow leeshores and again increases the losses by evaporation and absorption. The wind happensf to blow across the Sabari Hamun, the main sheet of water, in the direction of the flow, and as this wind begins just about the time the floods have reached their maximum, it^ has a great effect on the volume of flow. The wind is so powerful that while it is blowing the water recedes from the northern shore on the fan of the Harud Rud, 3 miles it is said; at the Kiih-i-Khwaja in April 1904 a quite moderate wind caused a depression of the water surface by over one foot. In the high wind at the end of January 1905 the water rose 4 feet on Lurg-i- Tiratki on the leeshore of the Hamun, where there was no escape for the water; it rose 2 feet on Lurg-i-Tesha Kani; at this level the water escaped. The velocity of the wind during the 24 hours probably averaged 50 miles an hour. This factor needs careful consideration in schemes of land reclamation, both as to the proper provision on the embankments for the height of the water and the necessary revetment, and as to the*direction that the currents will be started when the wind blows, so that the drains may be arranged accordingly. A table of areas and volumes of the inundated area at critical stages and a statement of flood levels which will be of use in examining the maps and sections concludes this Chapter. * This area could be easily reclaimed by extending the Warmal Canal through the gap in the dasAMo the we*t of Puxa-i-Adil Shah and out across the bay along the ridge. The canal bank would form the required protection embankment. This scheme was proposed by old Dadi (canal builder) to the Persian Commissioner. There is an old karis in the gap of the dasht he proposes to cut across. t U it correct to say happens might not the wind blowing through countless ages have shaped these basins fChap.

Those who have been to the pains of reading through the “ Revenue Report and Notes,” and have studied the maps while doing so, will have a very complete knowledge of the modern canals in Seistdn ; but as the information is scattered rather widely through those notes, it will be useful to draw attention to those features which are of importance from an irrigation point of view. The majority of the canals occupy the ridge formed by a deserted distri butary of the river, and are often that distributary contracted to give the flow now needed for irrigation ; the canal occupying a cunette in the bed of the shela has great discharging capacity in flood time with a good command at low river supply, because these shela always leave ridges built up of the silt that they deposit. The main system of canals is fed from some point in the river where a weir is constructed, such as the Rud-i-Seist 4 n system from above the Band-i- Seistan ; no weirs are allowed along the Rud-i-Seistan, and it is treated in all respects like a huge artificial canal feeding all the distributary canals by free and unobstructed flow. But weirs are allowed along the main channel of the river at, for instance, the head of the Nad-i-’Ali Channel and along the Rud-i- Parian, but no weirs are now built along the Nad-i-Ali Channel; this channel is treated in all respects like the Rud-i-Seistan. Each village has its own canal where possible, but villages lying far away from the river unite to have a main channel of supply, but even so there are a very large number of parallel canals, as will be evident from a glance at the map of the Rud-i-Seistan towards the tail of the Rud-i-Hasanki near Zahidan and Iskil, though towards Chiling and Muhammadabad this feature is not so bad. It was noticed that the Sar-o- tar tract was fed by clusters of canals in the same way, and north of Kala-i-Fath there are an immense number of parallel channels for the irrigation of the Palangi tract; so many that some ingenious local antiquaries suggested that some were abandoned, because the spoil banks of the silt cleared from the channel had become too high; the wind has now removed most of this silt, but it is quite possible that some of the channels are to be accounted for thus. But there are very few channels abandoned for'this reason in the cultivated tract. The river level seems everywhere on the rise and the command to be improving ; silt clearances are done periodically, some great work being undertaken each year before the band is made—see Appendix 7, of the “ Revenue Report and Notes.” Purely artificial canals are also cut ; they are usually very simple works with no great depth of excavation or other difficulties to contend with. The channels twist and turn much, as the zamindari canals to be seen on old canals in the Punjab before the light and leading got from the Chenab Canal shewed that it was possible for a cultivator to make as straight a ditch as an engineer. There are no works of any kind on these canals other than the tamarisk bridges where some important path crosses; and sometimes some tamarisk revetment at the head to prevent the head enlarging at flood time. The people have traditions about outlets on ancient canals and a few remains have been found, but the only masonry outlet seen in Seistan was at the head of the water course that fed the Jai Surkh Nawar. This water-course had a considerable draw in flood time ; if the head breached the cultivation was replaced by a lake; this happened in 1903 from a breach at a gap at another part of the lake. Many of the canals from the Rud-i-Seistan have escapes to the inundated area called Noro\ these are required, as there are no regulators either at the head of the Rud-i-Seistan or at that of the canals, and flood water has free access to all canals not completely closed off. The size of the channels decrease as they proceed. Some escapes are arranged at the tails of the canals and some from convenient places on the Rud-i-Seistan itself. The escapes are convenient and useful, but they only reduce and do not entirely prevent damage to crops, more especially as the beds of most of the escapes are cultivated. Thes8 [Chap. IV. , i i. « reach of the river are seldom seriously SgtaS to^he great carrying capacity that they possess already alluded to. Little need be said about these canals; we ran a line of levels along the Zorkan and Zarkan Canals from their heads in the present nver vaUey 4 „ 5 miles to the north of Kala-i-Gdwak to their tails in the del a ot the Khash. We found these canals quite the most skilfully constructed in the delta They have lone lengths of straight on them, and were evidently set out with thought; the curves are nominal, and it is evident they were not considered necessary nor were they on the Rohtuk and Butana Canals of the Western Jamna built at the ,me of the mutiny. These canals have some small masonry works* on them—outlets, abutments for platform bridges and a few syphon culverts. The tail reach of the Zorkan Canal seems now to be buried in part under the f a ^ °f the present Khash Rud. This line of levels was run by Babu Han Singh Bhan and no one else was able to go to the end of the canal to investigate. Some of the people say that the Zorkan and Zarkan were fed from the Khash Riid. It is possible that the tail reaches may have been at one time canals from the Khash Rud, but not very likely. Water from the Khash could only be carried a very short distance un on to the fan of the Helmand. The canal system to Sar-o-tdr was traced out and in some of the sand scours to the north of Palangi some earthen ware pipes were found buried in the canal banks and one very small masonry outlet, otherwise no masonry works were found on these channels either. The canal down the Rud-i-Sena was levelled along, but no works were found on it. An examination of the longitudinal section of this canal will shew that between the eighth and tenth mile from Dik-i-Dila there is nearly lo feet of ex cavation to be done on the channel before the water can flow. This site has not been re-examined since the levels were plotted and this point was noticed; if the makers never dug the channel down to required bed level here, then the canal never flowed. But it is not easy to understand how they came to dig the tail reach till they knew water would flow down the canal. Any one who has read this and goes to Dak*i-Dila should examine this part of the Rud-i-Sena canal to discover the reason for the high bar in the bed at this part. It may be due to the canal being buried under the wash down from the high plains near by. Many canals were traced throughout their length and levelled over in the trough of the river from Puza-i-Mashi to the Band-i-Seistan; some evidently very ancient j all alike devoid of any masonry work. Many canals were traced out in the Taraku delta. Mr. Tate found a masonry regulator on a canal near Burri, but the work from his description was very small, such as might be found on a large village water-course in the Punjab. Two small but shapely bridgesf were found on the canals in the Farah Rud delta—one between Peshawaran and Kol Marut and the other about 5 miles to the south of the former place on the road to Tappa-i-Kharan (or Karun). Some of the ancient canals were of great size ; the cuttings through the dasht to the east of Kala-i-Gawak are considerable earthworks. There is also a wide deep fairly straight cut from the site of the Mission Camp at Kuhak to the Jai Surkh Nawar and thence to the bank of the present river near Sharistan- i-Kuhna. These indicate attempts in the past to gain command of tracts, not commandable by leading the water along some deserted distributary of the river and as such are evidences of advanced thought and skill. Much valuable information could be got by studying the level of the point of command from which these ancient canals took out; such a study belongs more to archeology than engineering, but there is ample evidence to shew that among * See also the footnote to the fourth page of Chapter XII of this Report. t Photographs were taken of these and of the clumsv built TntLt. r.,i v r o, ^ ng plans filed) referred to in Chapter 1,1 of the” R e ,V»e LLf, nL. »' Ka ' l “ Sbah ^29 Chap. IV.] the level of the river has varied much in different ages, so that points once com manded ceased to be so. Some instances are referred to on the second page of Chapter LI of the “ Revenue Report and Notes”. The high Zahidan ridge is only now beginning to be cultivated, whilst the site of Nad-i-’Ali which from its massive and very ancient ruins must have been one of the bigest places in olden times is now so low that in the floods of 1903 the country around the ruins was under water. In dealing with possible schemes for irrigation in Chapter XIII it will be shewn that the river can be controlled and its waters so disposed that the tracts will not be submerged or left high and dry in different generations.

The latter rainfall is derived from Persian Gulf storms which pass over the frontier and give the winter rain in the Western Punjab ; these showers sometimes reach the Jamna. In Seistan this rain falls in light showers and is accompanied by much cloud which greatly adds to its value, but_ in the mountains it must at times descend in considerable falls to cause the high and sudden floods that occur in the rivers. The great floods are caused by heavy rain in spring falling on deep snow accumulated during the winter. (See the third and the last page of Appendix i of this report, and the first page of Appen dix 21 of the ,f Revenue Report and Notes Sir John Elliot states that in 1894 a fall of 6*23 inches was received in one day at Baghdad ; such a fall can never be liable to occur in Seistan, or the ancient buildings could not have stood in the way they have done. A fall of nearly one inch of rain in one afternoon at the end of April 1903 was considered an extra ordinary fall by the people. # * Dr. Bellew, who had spent many years in Afghanistan, often refers in his book From the Indus to the Tigris to the summer floods of the Helmand, whereas they are winter and spring floods; while the volume of the river steadily diminishes through the summer to its minimum.[Chap.

During the Afghan campaigns and the various missions to Kabul much valuable meteorologica Informauon must have been collected ; I have not had the time to find out if thisTso, or not, much less to ascertain where the mformat.on .s stored. The figures (Table 4, Statement L) given by Sir Jolin EIUot t 0 Sir William Willcocks shew that the rainfall at Kabul isabout one-third higher t an at Que ta; as Kabul is iust beyond the watershed of the Hazarajat, it is probable that the snowfall in the Hazarajat is higher than at Kabul. The figures shew that tne spring rains are sometimes very heavy. As has been said, it is these falls at the time the snow melts that cause the great floods. The account of the rainfall at Baghdad and of the phases of the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates given by Sir William Willcocks in his work on the irrigation of Mesopotamia shew that the rainfall of Asia Minor is similar to that of Afghanistan, and the phases of the rivers of Mesopotamia are the same as those that end in the Seistan Lake. In Seistan throughout the hot weather months there is a cloudless sky, and the high north by west wind blows, but in the hills there are occasional storms of rain such as that graphically described by General Ferrier on the 16th July 1845 at Zerni, when he visited the Chalap Dalan Peak, Kuh-i-Kaisar, on the nf thp Farah and Kash Rud.CHAPTER VI.

CHAPTER VI. Note on the rate of evaporation from the surface of water in Setsian. The annual evaporation in Seistan calculated from measurements made on the Jai Surkh Ndwar, an open sheet of water near our base camp, and on some pools in the Naiz&amp;r of the Hdmun-i-Puzak is about 10 feet a year. All the information is given in the statements in Appendix 3 ; from these it will be seen that the depth of water evaporated during October, November and December and March is much the same as that given by Molesworth for tanks in India, whilst in January and February it is much less ; this is to be expected, as the temperature in Seistan in the latter months is much lower than it is in Rajputana, Bombay or Nagpur, the provinces in which the Indian tanks are * The mean temperatures and the dryness of situated, whilst* the temperatures from October to December and of March are probably not very different. Doubtless the figures given in Molesworth were obtained from experiments made in the usual way in an iron tank of water floating in a reservoir of water ; the experiments in Seistdn were made by measuring the fall of water surface in the reservoir itself, so that losses by absorption are included in the figures. But we know that the bottom of these reservoirs is made of a very hard fine alluvial deposited in past ages by the river ; the reservoirs are filled frequently with water heavily laden with very finely divided silt, they are therefore nearly as staunch as an iron tank. At any rate the comparison of figures already alluded to would lead to this conclusion. In any case the absorption throughout the year would be the same and the amount must be less than f- 0 of a foot per month, perhaps not more than 1 foot a year since the total loss in February is only 3-0°^ a ^ oot * ^ this allowance is made for absorption, the evaporation is not less than 9 feet a year. But our observation on the behaviour of water in the pools in the Sar-i-Shela leads us to suspect that there is still much to be explained about the evaporation in Seistan. For instance, the pools in the bed of the Sar-i-Shela were filled by the flood of 1903 and the level of the pool by the boundary pillar No. 12 was taken on the 14th September 1903 and again on the 19th October 1904 the difference of level was found to be 2'6 feet, whereas the calculated evaporation for these 13 months is 11'2 feet, so that the actual depth evaporated here was less than one-fourth of the calculated depth. In May 1905 we crossed the Sar-i- Shela again and found that the pools still existed and the water had not appa rently decreased. The calculated depth evaporated from October to May is over three feet; this added to the evaporation before October 1904 is enough to have dried up all these pools. It is most unlikely that there is any subsoil flow in the Sar-i-Shela which would counteract the effects of evaporation, but some water may have been collected during the light falls of rain, but not enough to account for the figures. The Sar-i-Shela is however a narrow (200 yards) deep (35 feet) trench running almost at right angles to the direction of the wind, and it is possible that the water is shaded from the effects of the wind. The water is also intensely saline, and salt of great purity is obtained from the margins of these pools. The information about the Gaud-i-Zireh w’hich will now be described points to the fact that the evaporation from its water surface is not so great as in the Northern Hamun. The Gaud-i-Zireh w r as filled to a depth of 32f to 34 feet by the great flood of 1885 ; and water was received in the years 1886, 1887 and 1888. There is a very clear flood mark at Kala-i-Sidh and all along the scarp to the Dasht-i-Zireh seven feet below that of 1885 which gives a depth of water of about 25 feet; this mark probably indicates the level to which the water in the Gaud-i- Zireh subsided rapidly under the combined effect of evaporation and absorption. | Kala-i-Siah Reg— Close to the wells at Gumbad-i-Shah R.

From our level sections these nests indicate that the water surface at that time was at reduced level 1,555. and the Baltic ip bably came down the Sar-i-Shela with the floods in 1892.

It is quite possible, nay, even probable that the depth of the water in the sheet Colonel McMahon saw was deeper than three feet, and if so this part of the Gaud-i-Zireh is at a lower level than that measured at Oruk. The deepest parts o these bas.ns are found at places which have not been invaded by distributaries from a river.

VI.] Colonel McMahon also noted that there were brine pools at the wells at Gumbad-i-Shah ; these pools are not more than 6 to 10 feet deep below the general bed of the Sar-i-Shela. They last received water in 1892 ; in 1897 th ere was enough water in them to encourage Colonel McMahon and Dr. Maynard to bathe ; the water was so salt that both suffered severely. This shews that the depth evaporated in the Gaud-i-Zireh is about half that evaporated in the pools (chung) of the Northern Hdmun in which the measurements were made, while the depth evaporated in the pools in the Sar-i*Shela near the point where the boundary line crosses is only about one-fourth of the calcu lated depth. The water in the Gaud-i-Zireh is not so salt as that in the pools. The salt crystalises out from the brine at the margin of the pools in the Sar-i- Shela, whereas Colonel Yate says the water of the Gaud-i-Zireh was only slight ly salt, but we may feel sure that as the water diminished in volume it became more salt, as the deep bed is a sheet of salt. Colonel Yate’s remarks are import ant and are quoted here in full : &lt;{ We had to approach the edge of the water on foot, as the horse’s hoofs sank deep in the soft damp soil. This soil, however, was not so salt as it •This indicates that the salts are not deposited looked, and the covering of saline matter by the water but are brought to the surface by on top was of the thinnest* JUSt Sufficient to capillary action. gi ve jj- a gl ar e. The water of the lake we found beautifully clear and only slightly salt. Having heard that water drawn in the centre of the lake was quite drinkable, I sent a man to wade out as far as he could, and fetch a bowlful, and what he brought back was certainly not so very salt. To the east the water extended as far as the eye could see. To the south we could trace a long line of sand-hills, and to the north the low edge of the dasht or plateau extending to Taraku. When we arrived we found a large flock of pelicans on the bank, and numbers of white sheldrakes were swimming about in the water, but there was no sign of any other fowl.” The sand-hills to the south run all along that boundary of the Gaud-i-Zireh. They are trapped by the cushioning of the wind against the northern slope of the Baluchistdn hills. The strong wind striking this range produces a current in the opposite direction, and the sand-hills are situated where the opposing currents meet ; so that the velocity of the wind over the water in the Gaud-i-Zireh is probably very much less than that of the wind over the Northern Hamlin. It is also to be noticed that along the banks of the Sar-i-Shela, where the pool was measured, whose rate of evaporation has been quoted, there are also sand-hills which may also owe their origin to some diminution of the winds velocity. More over, as already stated, the pool is in a narrow deep trench. When I went to the Gaud-i-Zireh in September 1903 I had not thought of collecting this information about evaporation, but an engineer, who went down there again and took guides, who had seen the water at the times of flood, could level on to the marks which the guides point out and so recover the information. The best time to go to the Gaud-i-Zireh is after a flood has passed down the Sar-i-Shela. But since this cannot be foreseen, as such floods do not happen every year, the best time to go is during the rains of January or February. In May 1905 the water at the wells in the Sar-i-Shela at Gumbad-i-Shah was reported by men sent from our camp to be good and plentiful, while that t See his book “Wanderings in Baluchistan.” Ziarat Sbah-i-Mardan was drinkable but unpleasant. General Sir Charlesf MacGregor and Captain Lockwood got drinkable water at the wells at Gumbad-i- Shah in February 1876]; just before the Sar-i-Shela came down in flood, and Colonel McMahon^ and his party in April 1896 just before it came down in flood. They all recorded that it was about the worst water they had ever drunk. j The Sar-i-Shela had not flowed since 1866 probably. § See his lecture before the Royal Geogra- phical Society. “ Southern Border lands of Afghanistan (Volume IX, Fart 4).’' There are brine pools in the bed of the Sar-i-Shela close to the point where the road from Seistan to Robat crosses it and the measurements of the depth of water evaporated from these could be easily arranged for.

Lines of Levels A few remarks about the lines of levels run will be of assistance should it ever be necessary to make use of the Longitudinal and Cross Sections prepared therefrom. The levels were started at the end of February 1903 from a peg fixed due east of Kala-i-Kuhak, on the right bank of the Helmand River below the Band-i-Seistdn, for which a value of 1,000 was assumed. This peg is shewn on Cross Section No. 4 of the Zorkan Canal Series No. XXVIII-A. Later ... ^ . on when the Mission entered Persia this peg Bench ar on u a or. wag c0nnecte( ] to a B enc h Mark established on the burnt brick masonry drain in the east wall of the Kiihak Fort. All the levels down to Takht-i-Shah, Chakhdnsur, Amiran, and those up to Puza-i-Mashi above Kala-i-Madar-i-Padshah were worked with the value (R. L. I,023‘ii) of the Kuhak Bench Mark thus obtained. In the autumn of 1903 the Survey of India worked out the level of the highest point of the Kuh-i-Khwaja by Trigonometrical observations from the known value of some peaks in the Baluchistan hills ; a line of levels was run along the Rud-i-SeistAn by Babu Hari Singh Bhari, the most accurate of our levellers, from the Kuhak fort to this station of the Survey of India on the Kuh-i-Khwaja. A value of i,686'oi was then obtained for the Bench Mark on the Kuhak Fort; and all levels thereafter were worked to this value; the lines of levels already run w^ereconverted to the new value by adding 662*90 to the reduced level previously entered in the book and plotted on the sections. When the stay of the Mission was extended into 1904 many more lines of levels were run emanating from Kuhak, Check of levels. and eventually reaching the Kuh-i-Khwaja by circuitous routes. A chart shewing the differences in circuits is attached to the plan of the lines of levels run made on the quarter inch maps No. VIII and IX. Some of the lines where they intersect each other agree very well ; in other cases not so satisfactorily ; the lines w'hich had ary serious difference w^ere those carried for some distance across marshes in the Naizar by soundings, or lines carried down the face of some of the precipitous cliffs that fringe the water ed tract to the south. The lines across marshes were replaced in 1905 by levels taken when the marsh had dried up. The lines of levels carried along rivers or across the cultivated lands and along the shores of the Hamun proved to be very accurate when checked, much more accurate than could have been expected, seeing that they were run in all weathers at the shortest notice as lines of reconnaissance to obtain general information rather than a very accurate knowledge of levels. The late Sub overseer Nur Husain and Babu Hari Singh Bhari were both levellers of great experience and naturally very accurate and careful in their work. For a young leveller Babu Gopal Singh was also very capable. The other men had seldom any opportunity to level, being kept busy at other works equally important. The field work is contained in Field Books which have been cross-referenced ; and is plotted on to sections on a scale Plans of traverses. ^ 2 m jj eg an d one foot to the hundred feet vertical: on these sections full details are given of the country passed through. The traverses run were also plotted so as to enable the lines to be easily transferred on to the Survey of India maps when prepared.

Wanliss, Assistant Deputy Quarter Master General Intelligence Branch, 1 is hoped that the contoured map of the delta and the Na.zdr, and a longitudinal section of the River wdll be reproduced and a convenient atlas provided for use in reading this Report. Surveys, ' i -V- \ The great value of the levels with Stadia points in taking discharges will be referred to in the next Chapter; they stadia level* and Berthon boats. were a l s0 of great service in carrying lines of levels through tamarisk thickets, and over bad ground where it was very difficult to chain with any accuracy. The Berthon boats were also of very great value in taking cross sections of rivers and getting across flooded lands, and the work could not have been carried out effectively without them. Every levelling party should be provided with a plane-table to sketch in detail along the traverse line and thus add greatly to the value of the levels. A Survey of India pattern clinometer should be supplied with the plane-table for making rough cross sections. For work across waterless tracts water was taken in pakhal ; large leather Water skins. b . a S S made in P airS t0 be bun g .° n ^ side of a camel. The only convenience of a pakhal is that when empty a dozen or twenty can be loaded on to one camel, and thus transport is economised. This 'said their merits are disposed of; and only a long list of disadvantages remains to be recorded. We found, just as the Russo-Afghan Boundary Mission of 1884 discovered, that mushak^ i.b.) goat skins, are much more reliable and satisfactory. When crossing the desert to Khw&amp;ja ’Ali they were supplied with water by the Afghans, who brought it in mushak from the river; their own pakhal brought from India leaked and were useless. In building the boundary pillars we bought up all the mushak that were to be bought, and could only get enongh to load half a dozen camels. The mushak is water-tight and handy, but the supply available is small, and they are : cfiffi 011 ^ to get in India as in Seist&amp;n ; in Sukhur in December 1902 only about 30 could be bought ; they were obtained from the milk-sellers, who use them as floats for swimming the Indus to their herds on the islands. 1 J he t°t khal sh ?uld be made by experienced men (preferably bhisties) of good : leather, and sewn with a needle of smaller size than the thong used, otherwise the seams will always leak. The pakhal must be soaked for some days before 1 is used, and must never be allowed to dry while in use. Goat’s fat is the best4 i Chap. VII.] material for caulking leaks. The wastage from good skins depends on the heat of the weather; thoroughly good skins will evaporate all their contents in less than two days in the hot weather. If many pakhal are in use, a mocjii is required to do the repairs. He will require a supply of good leather, bee’s wax and goat’s fat. When building the boundary pillars Russian kerosine oil tins were used as cisterns to store the water on the works ; the fakhal were emptied and sent back to the wells at once. This tin is very thin and the life is very short, and all the tins that could be bought were worn out on this work. A dozen galvanized iron water cisterns made to load on camels should be _ , ... . kept at the Consulate for use in repairing: the boundary pillars. Leather is of no use for this purpose, for when the skins are put away in store and neglected they rot and become useless, whereas galvanized iron tanks would always be ready for use. Doubtless the Supply and Transport Corps keep a suitable kind, if not similar water tanks as were used on the surveys in the Bar of the Chenab and Lower Bari Doab Canals should be obtained.

Careful measurements of the discharge in the main stream of the Helmand River above the Band-i-Seistan, and in the three main distributaries were main tained throughout the stay of the Mission in Seistan. The daily records of the observations are contained in two manuscript books filed with the records ; these two books are very valuable and should be care fully kept, as it is not possible to extract into statements all the information an engineer can get from them. The 10 daily averages have been given in the Tables of Statement A ; curves too have been drawn exhibiting the rise and fall of the river; they will be found on Plans No. P. (i) to P. (9) among the original records filed. In addition to the measurements made on the flow of the main river and its branches; the discharge of a large number of canals was also observed ; these have been utilised in column 17 of Statement L of Persian-Seistan and columns 8 and 11 of Statement 8 of Afghan-Seistan in the “ Revenue Report and Notes.” The main value of these measurements was obtained at the time in guiding and directing our attention to important features in the irrigation practice of the country, which in so many interesting details differs from that of the Punjab plains on which we had been trained. The Mission was fortunately provided with Berthon boats, admirable in their handiness and staunchness in the most difficult currents, when handled by expert boatmen such as those we recruited from the Sutlej between Rupar and Phillour.* Fortunately we had with us spirit levelsf with Stadia marks in the telescope, so that we were able to measure the sites of soundings and paths of floats from the bank ; these measurements were much more accurately and quickly performed than any obtained by stretching ropes could be, and one observer with the assistance of a couple of boatmen could take a discharge of the Helmand in flood in a couple of hours. Any other method would have required several observers and perhaps a couple of expensive theodolites. Babu Ghulam Kadir had- had much experience in taking first class dis charge observations at Garhi on the Sirhind Canal, so that he w r as an expert at this work ; and was employed throughout on the measurements of the river, occupying his spare time in making plans and maps; for he is also a draughts man of exceptional merit. The discharges were calculated from surface float observations made in each segment that the channel was divided up into for the purposes of taking sound ings. The co-efficient used to obtain the mean velocity in the segment from the surface velocity was o'8i instead of o , 93, the one given in the printed forms used in the Punjab Irrigation Branch for calculating the discharge of a river. The mean velocity was also always calculated from surface slope observations taking •025 as the value of Kutter’s N, Measurements to ascertain the value of Kutter's N. In 1904 a set of velocity rods were obtained from Rurki and in October and November during the time of low river, when the water is most needed for sow ing wheat, a set of about thirty first class observations were made by Lala * For names see bottom of the first page of Chapter XLVIII of the “ Revenue Report and Notes.” f It may be useful to record here that we took six levels to Seistan and carried these and all other instruments on camels. The instrument was very carefully packed in its box ; the loose space being occupied by crumpled masses of tissue paper. The boxes were wrapt round with flax fibre, so that any blow to the case in which they were carried could not be transferred to the instrument. Each day a party of khalasies under a subordinate was detailed to accompany the camel that carried the load and see that it was assisted over bad parts of the road. In this way the instruments were safely carried to Seistan and safely brought back. If these heavy instruments had been carried by hand, a much larger number of men than was otherwise required would have been needed. The following were left at the Consulate in Seistan:— 4 Berthon boats. 2 Levels with staves, tripods and chains. 2 Rlane-tables. I Survey umbrella. Moore’s current meter.9 Chap.

The figures for each otSvation are rlcord ed on the Plan 0 among those filed ; and the accompanying statement gives the re h S - U h%r t t W0U d a PP f ea n- th D tthe dlschar g es recorded in the gauge book from wh.ch Statement A of th.s Report is compiled are about to per cent under-estN mated at this important season of the year. If the co-efficient of 0-93 given o„ the Punjao River Discharge Forms had been used to obtain the mean velocity the volume would have been 10 per cent, over-estimated. But it should be recollect ed that the volumes in Statement A are probably determined in exactly the same way as the volumes given in the irrigation statistics of most of the Punjab canals and so they may be allowed to stand. It will be noticed that the values of Kutter s N are rather high ; in artificial canals in the Punjab of the same size a mean value of about o’oiS would be obtained. J a The ratio (0732) of the mean velocity to the maximum surface velocity is a valuable figure to have ; on most Punjab canals the value is o’Si. ^ There was so much to do during the flood season that only two observations to determine the value of N at that season could be made ; a knowledge of its correct value at this season is not so important as it is at the time of 'minimum river and most important demand. The observations are given at the foot of the accompanying statement ; the Rud-i-Seistan was gauged on the 22nd and the main river on the 25th of April. The value of KuttePs N is very low • and the co-efficient of o-81 used by us in calculating discharges from the maximum sur face _ velocity proved to be practically correct for the flood time in the river. But it is not right to base far-reaching conclusions on only two measurements: da)S of patient work are needed to get the party of men into training to do really good work on such large volumes of water. For further remarks on the subject of Kutter s N during the flood season, please read paragraph n of page 176 of Bellas,V “Hydraulics” from which it would appear that the value of 0016 for Kutter’s N was quite to be expected from the Hdmand at this stage when the silt may have been just evenly spread on the bed and the regimen thereof for the moment was quite perfect. Measurements to ascertain losses by absorption and evaporation. When the party went up the river in September opportunity was taken to make^simultaneous measurements of the discharge up the river and at the Band-i- Seistan to get some idea of the loss of water in transit ; these may usefully be referred to here as pertaining to the volume of the river rather than to evapora- tion and absorption, which, in Seistan, more particularly concerns the waters in the lake. The results of these measurements are given in Statement M of the second volume of this Report. The measurements were made just as the calm cool season, and the annual rise of the river from its minimum, began. The first measurements were made on the 27th August when the river was still at its minimum of 903 cusecs ; the maximum daily temperature was then _i oo ' 5°, and the average wind velocity 29 miles an hour, the great wind having just come to its seasonal end ; the loss between Tirkoh and the band over a length of thirty miles of sandy bed was 2’5i cusecs per million square feet of area; on the third when the maximum temperature had fallen to 98° and the average wind velocity to 19 miles an hour the loss per million square feet of area was 0*516 cusecs along 64 miles of channel. The first 25 miles being over shingle and the last 39 over sandy bed. It should be recollected that the sand and shingle overlie the impermeable hard alluvial into which the river has cut its trough, and so the loss in sand and shingle cannot be very different once the river has saturated the loose material lying in the trough of impermeable material. On the loth the party were up the river as high as Kala-i-Madar-i-Badshah, the temperature had by then risen to 108°, and the wind had fallen to 11 miles an hour and was just about to blow with some violence and put a stop to further work of this sort. The loss was 1*9 cusecs per million square feet over a length of 70 miles of river, 39 miles of which was as before over sand bed and the rest over shingle. S644FD ^4 6 [Chap.

But the rapid diminution of discharge that goes on rfuly and August that has been noticed on the second page of Chapter X indicates how much greater the loss in the hot 'veather i. han it is in the cold. For it is probable that at some point above Ginshk the volume of the Helmand that feeds the long channel to Seistan is practically constant throughout August, September and October ; at any rate it does not vary so much as the volume at the bend varies. Attention is drawn to the figures of the daily rise in the autumn supply given for the year 1905 in Part III of Appendix 24 of the “Revenue Report and Notes.” From the small rate of loss obtained in these measurements we realise that the Helmand River owes its power to supply water to its delta to the fact that it flows over an impermeable bed; and leads to the reflection that big canals cut in this alluvial should have a very much smaller loss by absorption than the canals in the Punjab and therefore a much higher duty; and in designing canals this fact should be borne in mind, so that, as far as possible, large canals should be kept in or near this hard material, for f Chapter XI, page 69 of this Report. ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ higher the water saved should return a handsome profit on the money spent. It might even be advisable to carry the precious low river supply in a narrow deep canal all the way from Kala-i*Bist to the delta to save the losses due to the water meandering down the wide bed in a shallow stream. Maximum Hood discharges. Seistan is situated at the bottom of a land locked basin, where the habitations and the fields of men are not only liable to be swept away by the flood coming down the river, but also to be drowned out by the return tide of the water that overflows from the lake ; this must make the thoughtful intensely curious to know all about the floods of the rivers that end in the basin. Much time and thought was therefore devoted to ascertain the maximum flood discharges of all these rivers. The observations made are given in complete detail on some fifty sheets that will be found among the drawings and are lettered from A to G. It was found that the Baluchis up the river took an earnest interest in the flood levels of the river, and that they could expatiate on the floods of different years that they had witnessed; they could also point out the flood marks ; these once seen could be clearly distinguished by the layer of silt deposited, called locally kachana-i-mr- shuft i or the line of silt; this can often be traced for a considerable distance. These marks were carefully levelled along to obtain the surface fall of water at the flood from which to calculate the mean velocity of the cross section, which was also carefully chosen, and levelled across to calculate the area of the flood discharge. The flood that it was most important to recover full information about was the extraordinary one of 1885, which from all accounts is the greatest men now alive have seen, though it was probably closely approached by the flood of 1830 recorded by Captain Connolly. We did not meet with any one who could remember to have seen the flood of 1830, though very old men said they had een 0 d that it was a very great flood, nearly, if not quite, as great as that of 1885 Such a flood may be expected at least once in a century and to be h!H r o y ni aP S r ° a ? 0ne, ° r P erha P s two &gt; other occasions.

VIIL] it was, as some believe, the floods should have been greater. Perhaps now that we know more of the country some references will be found in ancient manus cripts. Favourable sites to make calculations were found at Pasand Kushta and Golodhan, down-stream of Kala-i-Madar-i-Padshah, and at Kala-i-Mir and Kala- i-Roden between Chahar Burjak and Bandar-i-Kamal Khan. All these were up the river, and above the spills down the old river beds to Taraku, the Rud-i- Sena or towards Palangi and Paisai on the east bank north of Kala-i-Fath. The spill down the Rud-i-Taraku was measured. A favourable site near Kala-i-Gawak tvas found at which to measure the maximum flood volume that swept over the delta. A full account of this flood has been given in Appendix 25 of the ' Revenue Report and Notes”; the figures obtained of its volume are given in the following statement; further information will also be found in Statement E of this volume. The former statement also shews the maximum flood volume of the floods of 1903 and 1904 calculated at the same time at each site ; those for 1903 agree with reasonable closeness with the discharge obtained at the Band-i-Seistdn during the flood, but those for 1904 are all much lower than the maximum discharge obtained at the band ; the reason for this is not known unless it be that the sections became silted up as the floods subsided. The same statement shews the measurements obtained for the maximum flood volumes of the Khash, Farah and Harud Rud. The Farah Rud we were able to measure Ourselves, except the spill that went down the Rudfl-Bandiki-i- Juwain direct to the Hamun-i-Puzak ; this spill channel takes out much higher up the river than we were able to go ; so that the true maximum volume in 1885 that came down this river is still a matter of conjecture ; some eye-witnesses say at the height of the flood as much water went direct to the H 3 mun-i-Puzak as passed into the H 4 mun-i-Sabari. We sent Baluchis to make the measurements required to calculate a dis charge of the Khash and Harud Rud. On the way they also took measure ments of the Fardh Rud from which the flood discharges for 1903 and 1904 were recalculated as a check with very satisfactory results. The figures are inserted in this Statement; we may feel that the discharges for the Khash and the Harud Rud are not far wrong and will suffice till some trained observer is able to go and make the needed measurements. We could not spare the time to go to the Rud-i-Bandanand Rud-i-Madai to get measurements from which to calculate the volumes that come down those torrents in flood. They are very conveniently situa ted to the Consulate and can easily be measured in the future. Information was also collected from which to calculate the volumes that passed down the Sar-i- Shela in the flood of 1885. All this information is utilized in making the calculations in Statements C, D and E of this Report for the filling and emptying of the inundated area in the floods of 1903, 1904 and 1885; they are described in Chanter XV.5 i CHAPTER IX. The silt carried in the water of the Helmand River. In any scheme for extending the area of cultivation in the delta by irriga- ^ , £tu . , tion works, the quantity of silt brought down by the river must receive due con sideration and be provided for. If the river is canalised and caused to flow in one definite direction, the silt will in time cause the bed to rise and extensive training embankments will be required to maintain the river in the course chosen for it. If drainage works are contrived, and the river is shut out from the wide shallow areas of Naizdr, and sent out into the deeper Hamuns, it will build up a delta for itself in the deep basin and its bed will gradually rise to a higher level. If the flood waters are carried to depressions the silt will be deposited there. The silt is also very fertile and is a desirable addition to the lands to be cultivated. When the Mission returned to the base camp at Kuhak at the end of March 1904 a daily measurement was started of the silt carried in the water. These measurements are given in Statement G., Table 1 :—column 3, gives the discharge of the river when 10-day periods are being considered, and column 4 when daily discharges are worked from, the proportion of silt by volume is given in columns 6 and 9. In column 7 the average velocity of the wind is given because it was found that the proportion of silt increased when the wind velocity was greater, perhaps because the wind blew sand into the water of the river from the sand banks along its course or off the arid plains past which it flows. The years 1904 and 1905 were characterised by poor flood and only one „ TT , „ „ „ observation was secured on a thick flood, Character of the thick water of a Helmand flood. ,v , ,, , n, r i _ ,1 that on the 21st March 1905 ; the propor tion by volume of silt carried by the water, at the height of the flood was 1 part in 127 ; a column of that water 127 feet high, would deposit a layer of silt one foot thick. The sudden arrival of the thick flood and the rapidity with which the water afterwards cleared is very characteristic of Helmand floods. The same feature has been observed by Sir William Willcocks in the floods of the Tigris —vide his note in Appendix 4.of this Report. The quantity of silt he observed at a high flood agreed almost exactly with that observed on this occa sion in the Helmand River, but in four days the Tigris water had, on that occa sion, so far cleared that the proportion was 1 in 714, whereas in the Helmand on this occasion the silt was 1 in 408 on the fourth day, and did not fall so low as 1 in 714 till the 8th or 9th day. It will be noticed how clear the Helmand water is once the flood has passed away. In Table 2 the total volume of silt brought by the water in the year 1904 Estimate Of total volume Of silt brought in the is calculated, and comes to enough to put year 1904. one foot of silt over nearly 5,000 acres. It is difficult to estimate what would be the amount of silt brought down in years of greater flood, but we might assume that the volume of silt was in pro portion to the maximum flood discharge of the year. This is only ^ a rough estimate because the volume of silt will depend on the number of thick water freshets that come down during the flood season, and on the tributary from which they came--factors that are not likely to vary directly as the maximum flood discharge.

With this information it is possible to make estimates of the rate that silt would be deposited by waters at flood time. But, if ever opportunity offers again, a daily measurement of the silt brought down during the flood season well considered system would give information of the greatest value; notice in Appendix 4 Sir William Willcocks’ appeal for similar work on the Nile. It will be realised from a study of the figures in Statement G of the silt , , , carried in the water that the channels in The alternate silting and scouring of channels. ,, j i, . , y. , , •1, j j the delta must be alternately silted and scoured. A record of the silting and scouring that went on at the bifurcation at Kuhak and Shahgul was kept and the information is given in the plans of Kuhak No. XLIII and XLIV and their accompanying sections and in the plans of Shahgul No. XLVI and XLVil and their accompanying sections. These plans are filed among the drawings. The flood of comparatively clear water that passed down the Rud-i-Seistan during April 1905 scoured out the silt most effectively ; this is shewn on the sections marked Plan No. XLV among the drawings filed. The level of the silt in the Rud-i-Seistan was six feet lower during the flood season of April 1905 than it was in July or August after the flood of 1903. After the floods of 1903 the bed of the Rud-i-Seistan was very high, and added to the difficulty of making the band', in 1905 fiver fell very low and there was no difficulty in making the band\ and the advantage of this clearance of silt was not realised. The scour that took place in April 1905 was in a large measure due to the fact that the band was not seriously breached at the height of the floods, and so a large volume of the clear water was forced down the Rud-i-Seistdn. The alternate silting and scouring that takes place during and after floods Methods of disposing of the silt. 18 we ^ understood on the perennial canals .. . of the Punjab and the regulation during this season needs great care and skill. The same care and skill will be required m working canals from the Helmand River.

IX.] or to so dispose of the silt that it does not close or block channels so that control of them is lost.^ This will be a work of more difficulty than the short, sharp nature of the thick floods would lead one to suppose, because the surplus of clear water over that required for irrigation is not very large and only lasts for a short time. The safest method would be to concentrate the silt laden water m one channel, so that the velocity would be sustained and the silt carried for ward : this would not always be so difficult, as at first sight it would appear, for the dirty floods are not always the highest, and a fairly long period of compara tively clear snow water follows after the thick flood. Attention is drawn to Sir William Willcock’s proposals for dealing with the thick floods of the Euphrates and Tigris given on the last page of Appendix 4 of this Report. But the most useful thing to do with the silt would be to spread it over the land ] to do this the flood water would be run to escape at many points along the river ; at each of these points there would be a drop of velocity and a deposit of silt. To avoid this drop of velocity the size of the channel carrying the flood must be contracted below each outlet. This could only be secured in carefully constructed canals and distributaries specially designed on Kennedy principles to maintain the velocity required to carry this silt. No effort should be spared to design the channels, so that the silt is delivered to the fields, not only would the crops be fertilised by this procedure, but the level of the country would tend to rise above the bed of the channels* instead of the bed of the channels above that of the country which has been the great difficulty in irrigat ing the delta in the past. Since a characteristic feature of a delta is the sharp ridge along which the canal flows having great command over the land in the drains to either side, it should be possible to flood the lands with siltf laden water, provided the fallow lands were kept separate from those cultivated to wheat and barley. Since the lands belong to the state, and the people are accustomed to redistribute them among themselves each year, it should be possible to so arrange the cultivation that it would be on a canal by alternate years : one year the canal would be used to spread silt laden water over the lands and the next year to irrigate the crops on these lands. It is possible that silting basins could be made in the cultivated tract ; for instance, in the basin between Dam-i-Kalan and Dik-i-Dalil, this basin could be drained to the depression to the east of Sar-o-tar. There are others in the northern delta. There are probably some depressions in the delta fed by the Rud*i-Taraku which could be drained to the Sur Daghal or to the Chah Muham mad Raza depression. If these were to be utilised, it would be necessary to pass flood waters down the Rud-i-Taraku past the head of the escape to the Gaud-i-Zireh proposed in Chapter XIII to be at Kala-i-Afzal. It may be noticed that the thick floods come from February to April when there is often very little demand for water for irrigation, as it is also the season of cloud and rainfall in the country. * The country could never of course rise above the command level of the canal. f Sir William Willcock’s works on “ Egyptian Irrigation ” are full of detailed information as to the way silt is added to the land in the delta of the Nile. Every generation of canal officers has urged the importance of this subject on their successors; when the construction of great irrigation works ceases to absorb so much of the energies of the best thinkers, far reaching advances will be made in this branch of irrigation science.

In Statement A, Tables I to 6, the observed discharges of the Helmand The average annual volume *at the Band»i« River at the Band-i“Seistan have been Seist ^ n * arranged so as to shew in a separate table the average daily discharge for each 10-day period in the spring and in the autumn crop season. The observations of the discharge made by the Mission began in February 1903 and ended in May 1905, but from the prescient details collected by Major Benn we are able to carry the tables back to the begin ning of October 1902, and from the measurements made by Mr. Keyes to carry them forward to the end of September 1905, so that we have tables based on observations for three spring crop seasons and three autumn crop seasons from which to deduce the volumes of the Helmand River in previous years, and from which to forecast what the volume will be in the future. In Chapter XLIX and Appendix 24 of the “ Revenue Report and Notes” the character of the Helmand volume for each year since 1865 has been described. From this description we realise that the period of thirty years from 1872 to 1901 was a cycle and that the year 1902 in all material points to do with the volume of the river was like the year 1872. In Table 12 the years are grouped into the five classes described on the first page of Chapter XLIX already referred to. These classes are (i) Dry years or Sdl-i-Khushk. (ii) Normal years or Sdl-i-Kdlabhi. (iii) Years of moderate flood or Sdl-i^Sel. (iv) Years of great flood or Sdl-i-SeUi-Kaldn. (v) Years of extraordinary flood or Sdl»i-Nuh-i-Kaldn. v The year 1905, Tables 5 and 6, is taken as the normal type of a dry year, i.e., year of poor flood ; the year 1904, Tables 3 and 4, as the type of normal year; and the year 1903, Table 2 as the normal type of a year of great flood in the autumn crop season, and Table 1 for a year of moderate flood in the spring crop season. So that we have only to construct tables for a year of moderate flood in the autumn crop season, a year of great flood in the spring crop season and for the year of extraordinary flood of 1885. The first has been done in Table 7 and the second in Table 8 and the last in Table 9. With this information Table 12 has been constructed to obtain the mean monthly discharge in cubic feet a second during the period of 30 years, with the following result Spring crop season.

During the spring crop season the supply at Bandar-i-Kamal Khdn is about i more than at the Band*i- Seistan. Vide the figures for 1903-04 in Appendix 24 ot the ' Revenue Report and Notes.” t In paragraph 48 of the memorandum in the Seistdn water question 4,200 cusecs at Bandar-i-Kamal Khan is given as the average volume of normal years ; its corresponding volume at the Band-i-Seistan is 3,600 cusecs.5 6 [Chap. X. The months are arranged _so as to bring ® J‘ ffe h ren f. bet ^en the volume of the falling over in August and September ana tne rising river „ Oc ober and November. It must be borne ,n mind that these figures are based on the assumption that the years we measured are the normal year o! their clas This assumption is probably not far wrong; the table for a normal year (Table 3) is perhaps above the average, while tha for a dry year (Table 5) fs perhaps a little below the average ; this and he table for a year of great flood are very difficult ones to construct. The important feature of the supply f rom an irrigation point of view is that from October to January ; it does not neces. sarily follow that the supply at this season will be good in a year of good flood or vice versa. But on the average of years these differences may be expected to neutralise each other. Each year of observations will enable a nearer estimate to be made of the normal volumes of each class of years into which the character of the floods have been divided, especially if the officer making the observations continues the investigations into the past by collecting more details from observant men* who have lived in Seistan. While the date of low river seems to come each year just before or just after the first of September that for high flood may come at any time from the end of March to early in May. And there may be considerable flood any time after the beginning of Decemberf. The weather, as has already been explained in Chapter V, comes from Persian Gulf storms, which furnish the cold weather rains of the Punjab ^ and the North-West Frontier; those who are observant of these rains will understand the phases of the Helmand River at this period of the year. Suffice it to say, that no attempt has been made to average out the supply due to the variations of the date of high flood in different years, only because the average discharges during the flood season are not important from an irrigation ^ point of view. The lowest discharges are then always sufficient for the cultivation to be done, and measures for flood protection must be based on the greatest discharge ; this we have ascertained from the flood marks of the great flood of 1885. In the Seistdn delta the spring crop sowings begin punctually at the autumn equinox {vide page 57 of Chapter X of the “ Revenue Report and Notes ”), and the autumn crop sowings begin at the spring equinox ; it would have been more satisfactory to have made out the tables accordingly, but this would have added a good deal to the complexity of the calculation and not materially altered the results. Practical convenience will probably be best met by making the account from the first of October and the first of April respectively. In Chapter XIV, page 97 of the “ Revenue Report and Notes,” it has been explained that all failures of the supply in the river occur only in the hottest months of July and August; there has never been a failure of the cold weather supply. In 1902, although the river below Rudbar was dry for nearly three months, yet at the end of September it came down in good flow, and during November and De* cember there was a very good supply in the river. This is the valuable feature of the Helmand River, and it is this trustworthy cold weather supply which makes Seist&amp;n the granary from which wheat and barley can be obtained in years of the greatest drought. This fact has been established by the observations of the Missions in 1872 and 1902, both of which reached Seistan after a year of great arought when the grain had been exported to relieve the distress in the neighbour* mg districts. In Chapter X of the Revenue Report and Notes” the system of cultiva* tjon been described, and it is explained how wheat and barley can be sown thioughout the spring crop season, so that in years in which the supply in the river is poor m early autumn, it is still possible to raise a good acreage of crop, as t re supply at the maturing time of the crop is always sufficient. The average annual acreage of spring crop may therefore be arrived at rom e average monthly discharge throughout the spring crop season, so soon as a suitable Duty has been determined. ^ Thls ? ver . a gs mont:lll y discharge from Table 12, Statement A, is 4 .° 7 ° cusecs, this ffischarge may be considered to be inflated by the fa ct that the spring such o'Sons reminded ol their previous erperie.re ». t In 1905 the Band was carried away by a flood of 50,000 cusecs on the 20th of December.57 Chap. X.] floods come down at the end of March, and have thereby improved the discharge of the last week of March considerably. In the present circumstances of Seist&amp;n this improvement cannot be availed of, because the channels are not provided with regulators other than the tamarisk band } which are at this season necessarily gaped and unable to control the supply. But with canals under control this volume would be most useful, and the 8,293 cusecsatthe end of March would on the average of years be utilized, so in considering the irrigational power of the Helmand River in its delta the full figure of 4,070 cusecs will be retained. Duty. The duty of water, or the area that one cubic foot a second running through out the six months will irrigate on the average, may be examined from two points of view : first, the duty obtained from the existing irrigation system and methods; and, secondly, the duty which may be expected if the water is rigorously distribut ed to the best advantage by suitable works under the control of impartial, highly trained officials as is done on the Northern India canals. The duty of water that now obtains in Persian Seistan has been described on page 102 of Chapter XIV of the u Revenue Report and Notes.” The average duty on the water used throughout the crop is 49 acres in the spring crop season and 8 acres in the autumn crop season. Better duties than these are obtained on occasional -channels where the cultivation is vigorously pushed on, and the volume of water is limited, but the above figures may be accepted as a fair aver age duty in the delta on the supply running throughout the season. This is a very common figure of duty the world over, where there is an excess of water and necessity does not compel economy in using the fluid. At page 103 of the same Chapter of the “ Revenue Report and Notes” the duty on water available to sow the wheat crop in Persian* Seistan has also been worked out and is found to be 85 acres for the spring crop, the autumn crop duty on the same supply being 13 acres a cusec. This is not a high duty, as it is calculated on the water poured into the heads of the canals either at the Band-i-Seistan or at Shahgul at the head of the Rud-i-Parian and Rud-i-Nad-i- Ali. The canals are all very short compared to the long canals common in Northern India. This low duty shows that the supply in Persian Seistdn for this crop _ is usually ample. The canal systems and the administration are not so defective that a larger area could not be cultivated if more land were brought under command ; there is abundant evidence to shew that the people are anxious to bring more land under cultivation. Some encouragement is being given to the + ste footnote to page 89. Chapter XIII of the leadingf men in the Miankangi to extend “ Revenue Report and Notes.” cultivation into the tamarisk thickets, and into the lands about Takht-i-Shah that were Naizar a few years ago, but which the changes in the river have now left dry. In the footnote to the last, page of Chapter III of this Report a scheme is referred to by which the plains around Chah Muhammad Raza will be reclaimed from the inundated area, and in Appendix 14of the “ Revenue Report and Notes” the extension of irrigation into the Chah-i-Nima depression is described. The highest duty that ?night be obtained from the water in the Helmand Delta. At the end of Chapter XIV of the “ Revenue Report and Notes ” strong reasons are given why the spring crop The spring crop duty. duty in Seistan should be higher than it is in Northern India on the Punjab perennial canals for instance. Briefly these reasons are that the winter is cooler and the moisture of the small rainfall accompanied usually by a light fall of snow goes further than it does in the Punjab ; the soil is a finely divided loam, very cool and need- in^ only light waterings. The people have practised irrigation from time * The figures for duty in Afghan Seistan vary so much and are based on such small areas that they do not help much • the local circumstances of each canal must betaken into consideration before basing calculations on the dutv obtained. The figures which are very interesting and useful are given in great detail in Statement K tor Afghan Seistan in the “ Revenue Report and Notes.” The average figures are 42 acres per cusec for the spring crop and 15 acres per cusec for the autumn crop.

Voooto 100.-02 the mean spring crop duty was .S3 acres a cusec (w* Punjab triennial report for this period). While m the Chief Engineer s Report on the project for the Upper Jhelnm, Upper Chenab, and Lower Ban Doab Canals the duty at the distributary heads for a new canal like the Lowerf Chenab is stated to be 208 acres per cusec, and for an old canal like the Upper* Ban Doab it is 234 acres a cusec. Under these circumstances, if suitable works are constructed in Seistan and placed under skilled and impartial control, it may be expected that the duty on the supply at the Band-i-Seistan will not fall short of 175 acres per cusec in the spring crop season ; and in fact in time it^ should rise above the duty of 234 acres per cusec obtained on the Upper Bari Doab. The duty in the autumn crop season will not be so good as that in North. ern India in the same season. The hot Tha autumn crop duty. weather in Seistan is cloudless and dry; a high wind blows throughout the hottest months and causes great loss of water by evaporating the moisture, as much from the soil and the plants, as it does from the surface of the water. Whereas in the Punjab the supply is eked out by timely falls of rain, and the winds are only of moderate velocity. The great effect of this hot dry wind is seen on the supply in the River Helmand which increases in volume as soon as the wind abates ; this only occurs when the weather becomes cool early in September, then periods of calm set in. The volume deliver ed by the river is diminished in the same way in every distributary and water* course. So this duty must of necessity be poorer than that which obtains on the canals in Northern India. As the volume to mature the autumn crop is, on the average of years, less than the volume available for early sowings of spring crop, and since the duty of water in the hot season is so much less than it is in the autumn, it will not be economical, or wise to spread the water towards the end of the hot season over a wide area, but the moderate supply should be concentrated on a selected small area to get the best results. Since the river is in flood in early spring it will always be possible to give floodings to all lands under command to sow * See notes on Irrigation Works in the Punjab prepared for the Commission on Famine Protective Works. t 1 he branches of this canal have been working for various periods from 5 to 12 years. X This canal has been working about 50 years.59 Chap. X.] melons, millet, and pulses ; a sufficient area of these crops can be sown over the whole area irrigated to spring crops, and if the floodings are of ample depth, the crops will mature with perhaps an additional watering to some fields at the end of ]une, given just before the supply becomes too low to afford water for such crops. In this way as large an area of these low class crops as it is profitable to cultivate can be grown. If the high class crops such as gardens, cotton, sesame (til) and maize are concentrated in selected areas a large area of these also can be raised, but if these crops are cultivated in fields scattered over every village, only a very insignificant and precarious area can be done. Since the land all belongs to the State, and the people have from time immemorial redistributed their lands each year, there should be no difficulty in making an arrangement of this sort in Seistan. The arrangement would not be in any way far fetched. At the present time in Seistan there are large areas chiefly on the Rud-i-Seistan which only cultivate spring crops, and a limited area of melons and millet. While there are other favourably placed villages, for the most part situated along the banks of the main stream in the Miankangi, in which a large area of cotton, sesame (til) are cultivated in addition to melons and millet*. All that is needed is to group this high class cultivation on certain selected canals. If this is done the area of high class crop that could be raised in the autumn will depend on the supply available towards the end of August or early in September. A six- inch watering (as measured at the Band-i-Seistan) at that fairly cool time of the year should mature the crop, so that one cusec of supply at the Band-i-Seistan should mature four acres a day, or 120 acres in the month. This seems the best way to forecast the acreage of these crops that could be grown. The area under melons, millet and such lower class crops would probably bear the same proportion to the area under wheat and barley, as is at present grown in Persian Seistan, viz.) 10 or 12 per cent. ; as this doubtless represents the needs of the people for this class of crop ; and this proportion would con tinue till the conditions of life changed very materially. The area of cultivation that may be expected in Seistdn. Without materially altering the present system of canal administration we may expect the people to cultivate Spring crop. 1 i * r an average annual area or spring crop of 199,430 acres, obtained from an annual average supply of 4,070 cusecs at the Bandu-Seistan with a duty of 49 acres a cusec. At the present time 148,103 acres of spring crops are grown with this supply distributed as follows Persian Seistan ... ... ... ..

Acres. 128,597 19,506 Total 148,103 From these figures we see, if the average duty does not alter, that each side of the river might do one lakh of acres of spring crop cultivation, so that the area on the Afghan side should increase five-fold while that on the Persian side would decrease a sixth ; but, as a matter of fact, if the Afghans expand their cultivation in the same way that the Persians have done, they could do the same area as the Persians do. All that is required to insure this being done without injury to Persian interest is that the volume from time to time available should be divided justly between them. If each side of the river cultivated 130,000 acres of spring crops in the year the average duty would only be or ^ acres a cusec—a duty that is already exceeded on some channels which obtain an assured but never an excessive supply.

The autumn crop supply is inflated at the sowing time of the crop by flood wa -ter which m the St 0 years destroys the spring crop then ripening to the harvest, and fhou 'h thesl floods enable a large area of melons to be grown without much abour to feed the people, yet the surplus crop has no money value and only a very limited number of melons grown near big villages can be exchanged tor other commodities. On the other hand, there are certain favoured tracts lying along the main stream in the M.dnkangf and in he Afghan and Persian villages near the Midnkangf, where a large area of valuable cotton and millet is grown, which considerably raises the money value of the autumn haivest in those villages. In these tracts the autumn harvest is a valuable proportion of the annual cultivation done in the village. This can be seen by pricing out and comparing the figures for cultivation done in villages in the different of Persian and Afghan Seistdn ; or hy comparing the figures for the Miankangi Mahal with those for the Pusht-bAb and Shit&gt;-i-Ab Mahals in the estimate of the total value of Government revenue given in Chapter XIII; the revenue from cotton in the Miankangi is 12 per cent, of the revenue from wheat and barley, whereas in the Pusht-i-Ab and Shib-i-Ab it is only 2 per cent.; the figures for millet and pulses give similar results. The acreage done by the ploughs in these tracts may also be compared ; a plough in the Miankangi does much the same area of spring crop as a plough in the ^ Shib-i-Ab and Pusht-i-Ab, while one in Afghan Seistan does much less, but ^ in the autumn crop a plough in the Miankangi cultivates 19J acres, in Afghan Seistan 12-9 acres, and in the Shib-i-Ab and Pusht-i-Ab only 6| acres (vide Statements M and N for Persian Seistan and Statements 6 and 7 for Afghan Seistan in the “ Revenue Report and Notes”.) These figures shew that the autumn crop cultivation is concentrated in the tracts adjoining the main stream of the Helmand River, where in good years a large area is flooded in the spring when the river is full and ample water continues to flow down the main stream to mature the crops; on the Rud-i* Seistdn the band is carried away by the first, good flood and only a moderate amount of flooding is done at the height of the flood. When the floods subside only a small supply goes down the Rud-i-Seistan, because the band is seldom renewed till the river reaches its minimum at the end of August, or early in September. In poor years like 1905 the band probably holds, as it did in the year in question, and forces large supplies of nearly clear water down the Rud-i* Seistan ; the bed is scoured out and the Rud then draws on the main river, whereas in years of good flood, when the band goes early in the season, the bed is raised by silt, and the Rud drawls a comparatively small supply during the maturing time of autumn crops. Further, in dry years, the low supply that obtains in July enables the band to be readily and quickly built as occurred this year (1905), and the water is then all secured by the upper canals, so that the lower canals on which the valuable cotton, millet and pulse are grown are left dry, and there is a serious failure of these crops.

X.] The fact that large areas of these valuable crops are grown along the main stream shews clearly that good years come more frequently than bad, or this system of cultivation would not have been in existence. It would have been usual to repair the Band-i-Seistan early in July instead of in September, and the autumn crop would have been concentrated on the Rud-i-Seistan. In 1902 the river dried up and the failure of autumn crop was complete over all the delta ; in 1905 the volume of the river fell to about 300 cusecs at minimum river, and the failure was greatest on the lands irrigated from the Nad-i-Ali Channel and the Rud-i-Parian, as at the height of the hot season no water went down these channels for about two months ; the water that could not be forced into the Rud-i-Seistan was taken by the Jahanabad canal which took out above the Band-i-Parian. The autumn crop is, therefore, liable to fail entirely once and to fail partially in two other years in a generation ; such as it did in 1875, 1884, in the period from 1872 to 1901 and 1905 in the cycle that began in 1902 ; in the remaining years the supply is ample and a much larger area could be grown than is cultivated at present. The average annual area that could be cultivated if well conceived works were constructed and wisely administered. The average annual area of spring crop that could be cultivated if suitable works were constructed and the water prmg crop. distributed to the best advantage is the average annual duty per cusec multiplied by the average annual supply available in the spring crop season; both these figures have already been arrived at and are 175 acres a cusec into 4,070 cusecs, or 712,250 acres of average annual area of spring crops. If we assume Autumn crop. that the average annual area of the lower class of ^ autumn nn rron crops of melons, millet and pulses is 12 per nn rrnn ~ cent, of this area as proposed on page 59 of this Chapter, the area of this class of crop will be 85,470 acres ; while the average annual area of high class crops will be, if we accept the figures already arrived at, 120 acres X 1,279 cusecs, 153,480acres, making a total average annual area of autumn crops of 238,950 acres.

The sprint crop figures arrived at in column 2 of Statement K may be accepted, as the area under these crops is not likely to vary materially from the present proportions and if they do their money value will not alter. A good Government would control the cultivation of opium, and the area is likely to be less rather than more than the 750 acres ^ indicated, but the figure for opium, though important from the point of view of the welfare of the people, is an insignificant area compared to the large area of wheat and barleyi and its culti* vation will not affect the area under these crops.^ The cultivation of an oil crop is much needed ; a little taramira (eruca sativa) is grown now and yields well from all accounts ; some area of barley will no doubt give place to this crop ; a mere detail in an estimate though of considerable importance to the community, who are badly off for these valuable oils. A forecaste of the autumn crop gives scope for the display of much local knowledge and acumen in forecasting what is likely to occur when all the water of the river is under perfect control, but it is better to accept the proportions given in Statement K, as there is every reason to say they are on the side of safety. The area under cotton would doubtless expand under a wise Government. Sesame when successful pays well, but the proportionate area under cultivation is not likely to expand on account of the uncertainty of its yield. Tobacco; melons and gardens are only cultivated for home consumption, and are likely to be always so cultivated, though tradition says that in the days of the prosperity of Seistan before Nadir Shah’s invasion wine was made from grapes. The column 4 of Statement K of this Report also shews the net produce to be expected from the million acres of cultivation, these figures are got from the rates of divisible produce per acre (column 3) in normal years given in line 11 of Statement H of the Revenue Statements for Persian Seistan. This assumes that the produce per acre in Afghan Seistan will have improved from what it is now to what obtains across the river—a not unreasonable expectation. The produce has been valued at the rates current when wheat is one kran* * This is Rs. 1-13-3 an Indian maund. Kran. Rs. the Seistani man. It is impossible to fore caste what the rates will be when the circumstances of Seistan are so improved The area to bo brought under command. deserted for other lands in the fifth £Chap. X.] 63 rare ; at the present time there is a superabundance of land everywhere. If, therefore, 750,000 acres of spring crop are to be cultivated annually on the average of years and the full fertility of the soil is to be maintained at least 1,^00,000 acres of culturable land should be brought under the command of the canals. In fact it would be better to bring 2,000,000 acres under command, because if aii average of 750,000 acres is to be attained, m good years a larger area must be sown. At the same time it is evident that 2,000,000 acres of culturable land under command is ample for the water available. To the culturable area commanded we may add 10* per cent, to get the ' gross area commanded, making that area 2,200,000 acres. This 10 per cent, will provide for unculturable patches of bad land, as well as the land required for village sites, roads, canals, graveyards, etc. The land in Seistan is of such good and even quality that except in localities where high uncommandable plains locally called dasht, tracts of dense sand-hills, or an occasional area of alkali land is met with all the land is sweet and culturable. In the Tables in Statement H of this Report the tracts of high uncommandable plain and dense sand-hills have been separately measured and excluded. The alkaline tracts are so small that they are not worth excluding by separate measurement and are provided for in the 10 per cent, allowance. From Table 4 of Statement H of this Report the gross commandable area belowf Rudbar is— Column 9 watered and cultivated Column 10 culturable but not watered Column 13 high but commandable Total There is an area of 188,825 acres of culturable land covered by dense sand hills (column 11) which might, ultimately, be reclaimed by cultivating the lands to the windward of these hills and so stop the sources of sand supply; the wind would then in time remove the sand and reveal the ancient canals or rivers that now lie buried beneath the high dunes. The 312,832 acres of Bunnumstdn (column 7) could also be reclaimed by suitable protection embankments and drainage schemes. Adding these areas (501,657 acres) to the above total we get 2,566,657 acres of gross area which could by any possibility be commanded. This area includes 501,657 acres, which can only be reclaimed by long and diffi cult processes, and 550,708 acres which can only be commanded by taking out high ^ level canals, so that the balance of easily accessible gross commandable area is only]: 1,514,292 acres. This broad fact emerges from these calculations that the water and the culturable land just about suffice for each other. And if it is desired to extend cultivation to one million acres per annum on the average all the culturable com mandable land below Rudbar that can be irrigated at reasonable cost should be provided for in the contemplated scheme. The culturable area which the Persians and Afghans should have under com mand. If we assume that the Persians and Afghans should each have 130,000 acres of average annual spring crop cultivations, we may by the same method adopted on the previous page of this Chapter calculate that each should have 286,000, say * This must be taken as my personal opinion. I have often worked out such figures for tracts to be irrigated—see my note on the Sind-Sagar Thai, page 25 for some details derived from Punjab districts. The 10 per cent, taken in this Chapter errs on the side of safety. t The area between Rudbar and Bandar-i-Kamal Khan that is in the trough and not in the delta is very small. + It should be borne in mind that the volumes adopted in these calculations are for the supply at the Band-i-Seistan, whereas the command of this land will be got from Bandar-i*Kamal Khan, where the average spring crop supply is about 1-6 better. On the other hand, the distance the water must be conveyed to the bulk of the land will be greater. The figures tend to shew that in the Helmand Delta the water is in excess of the land, and a surplus will be available to develop the trough] wide Chapter XVII.

Canals have this great difference from railways that the great bulk of the work is done in the country from the material at hand. The 'older canals on the Jamna and the Ganges had little or no iron in their structures being built entirely of brick, stone, lime and wood obtained on the spot. S The main expenditure on irrigation construction is in earthwork, the cost of earthwork is entirely in labour, usually called unskilled, but, as a fact, very rapid progress is not made till the works have been long enough in hand for workmen to become inured to this severe form of labour. The next item of expenditure is on # masonry, i.e., bricks and lime; the greater part of the cost of bricks and lime is on'fuel, and the balance is on labour, that is, more skilled than that employed on excavation, but not so skilled as the artizans employed to lay the bricks. Of the latter only a comparatively small number are required. They are a class easy to recruit, manage and handle and once the so-called unskilled labour is obtained in sufficient quantities, and arrangements are made for fuel, the progress on the work is secured, and economical work is only a matter of business ability in handling money. In large works in the bed of a river the next big item of expenditure is p umping . doubtless pumping. We may dispose of this item in detail at once. It involves expenditure in England in machinery and local expenditure on fuel. The few artizans required are now plentiful in India, easily recruited, and admirable men in every way. Pumping machinery is not bulky or difficult to convey, and if required could be easily taken from Nushki to Seistan ; the road is very much better now than those from the sea ports to the Diamond Fields of Griqualand West, as I knew them as boy ; the distance was about the same; water and grazing was not much more plentiful than it is along the trade route: but dig gers expected less than those brought up amid the resources of the fertile plains of India. But there is every reason to think that no pumping* will be required in Seistan ; the alluvial is almost if not quite impermeable to water except at places fSee last page but one of Appendix 23 of “ Reve- where pockets of sand are met with; nue Report and Notes.” these are usually well known,f being the sites for wells of drinking water in dry years. If subsoil water cannot be alto gether avoided, it can probably be dealt with by hand baling, a very efficient me thod of unwatering in shallow lifts, for which centrifugal pumps are now used, but which in old days of cheap labour were almost invariably baled}. Steam engines should be avoided, if possible: the fuel available locally is only highly inflammable scrub which can only be burnt in furnaces of a special pattern; these may not be obtainable in the market; at any rate no Indian engi neer is likely to be familiar with their use. On the second page of Appendix 9 of this Report a suggestion has been thrown out that some use should be made of camel-thorn and wormwood for fuel either by compressing the plant, or extracting its inflammable juice. Afghanistan is apparently an even more treeless country than Baluchistan and some convenient source of energy is much needed to develop the country : coal and petroleum are found in Baluchistan, but unless railways are pushed on ahead of other develop ments these cannot be fully utilized; whilst these plants can be got where neither coal or petroleum will ever be found, and it will be obvious to any one studying the economical development of these lands that the energy in these shrubs should, if possible, be made available to drive motors. * From Technical Section Paper No. 133 on the Jhelum Canal headworks by the late Mr. H. J. Johnston, C.I.E., Superintending Engineer, the cost of pumping was 5 per cent, of the cost of the weir,undersluices and the regulator. J Experts at baling can be got in the Gurdaspur , or any other District where lift irrigation is largely done : it would be well to recruit and take a hundred or so of these to Seistan. They will bale in the Punjab at a rate of about Re. 1 per 1,000 cubic feet on a single lift of 6 feet and earn high wages.68 [Chap.

Since r * o S rt e thebU ' °” e ° P the river has a considerable slope* it will be easv to get sites suitable for turbines ; and water power sufficient to drive all the machfnery can be relied on for works in the trough of the river above Bandar. i-KanS Khan, in all but one year in a generation Even ,n that year power can be &lt;rot by going high enough up the river and placing an emergency power house to” be used if needed ; steam will be so expensive that 50 or 6o miles of electric transmission will be no great obstacle, the river has never been known to rlrv nn ahnvp. the Rudbar canal head. There are flour mills driven by water power in the delta at Kala-i-Fath, Nad-i-Ali and Warmal. So that even in the delta small installations of water power can be arranged for. The wind is not likely to be of much use j it only blows with constant force in the hottest time of the year, and to the best advantage in the delta where power is not likely to be much required ; for there is little or no ballast for concrete there in and all masonry work must be built of brick, or stone from the Kuh-i« Khwaja. If, however, unwatering has to be done in the delta, the hot weather will be a good time to do it; the supply is then at its minimum and the wind at its maximum. The labour is free from the harvest about the end of July ; the floods do not usually arrive in large volume till the middle or end of March, while the wind can be relied on from the end of May to the end of August. Wages of labour and cost of excavation. We may now consider the rate of hire of labour on which the cost of earth work, bricks, lime and masonry work will ultimately depend, and then the cost of fuel and limestone which are second only in importance to the wages of labour. Since the conditions of life in Seistan are those of Persia rather than of India, it will be reassuring to the engineer new to Seistan to have all the infor mation collected in detail; this has been given in Appendices 5 to 12 of this Report. It will be seen that the labour problem is very much the same as that in Baluchistdn, and will be familiar to railway and roads and buildings men who have worked on the frontier, but not so to those who have worked on the plains of India. The labour will be recruited in much the same way as it is in the Quetta Skilled labour district ; the highly skilled artizans will be brought from he Punjab, with whom Seis- t&amp;n is likely to be very popular as the conditions of life and of climate suit them well. ^ This class of labour is not likely to cost much more in Seistan than it does in the Quetta district, as food is cheap and the difference will be little more than the extra cost of conveying the men to and from Quetta to Seistan. There are wu/more skilled labourers such as masons, carpenters, blacksmiths in Seist&amp;n than suffice for the ordinary requirements of the country, and the cheapest and best sources to recruit these will be India. Doubtless some would come from Kain and Meshed, but they would not be trained to our class of work, and would be neither cheap or efficient. Some of the labour for Unskilled labour. of monotonous manual toil. earthwork will be got locally, the Seistdni of Persian extraction is inured to such labour, but those of Baluch extraction soon tire69 Chap. XL] The census figures in Statement R for Persian Seistan and 13 for Afghdn T , , Seistdn in the “ Revenue Report and Labour available. ■ *, 11 • i • r • fsiotes give complete iniormation as to the numbers of the different classes of the people; under-labourers there are 23,060 souls in the former and 12,000 souls in the latter. From among these 35,000 souls, there should be 6,000 able-bodied men; all will not of course be available for works : but in addition there are also many able-bodied men among the cultivators, weavers and artizans who are available for works. So that there should be no difficulty in obtaining an average of 6,000 able-bodied men for works, if the class of work is sufficiently varied to suit all tastes. The Persian, unlike the Indian, has a taste for luxury and is eager to earn that he may spend: the low class Indian coolie will not labour on Public Works so long as he has food from the harvest in his home. Men are often met in the villages of Seistan who have been to India to work. A gang of 6,000 labourers is ample for the work of making distributaries T , j and small canals, but for the two or three Labour likely to be required. ,, , i , . , . , years that headworks and main canals are being made an average of 15 or 20,000 labourers will be required. At such times outside labour will be needed, and at all times outside labour should be encour aged to come in freely, or the rates are bound to rise as the local labourer be comes affluent and independent. There are doubtless large numbers of industrious peasants in the Persian ^ It . districts bordering on Seistdn, and Outside sources of labour. i i i i • • i i though these districts are separated by long distances over almost desert roads, yet, if the roads are made safe and facilities for food and water on the way properly made, these peasants will come in sufficient numbers to be useful. The main source of supply will no doubt be the Pathan and Hazdra labourers, who now cross into India in search of work, and who will doubtless prefer to go to Seistan, as the climate is cooler than that of India. At present there are very few of these people in Seistan, and there are no facts to go upon. But we may feel confident from our experience on frontier works that trustworthy employment will attract these people in large numbers to Seistdn, as it has done to the frontiers, and even the plains of India. They should be encouraged as they are expert and experienced labourers, and such are needed to leaven the mass and improve the quality of work and rate of progress. From the information gleaned from the work on the Imperial Bank buildings , p . given in Appendix 8, it will be seen that Wages of labour and cost of excavation. &lt;• i t i i j . • r the wages of labour should not rise above the rates now prevailing in the Quetta district if proper arrangements are made to advertise the work in the tracts from which labour comes, and in other ways to bring in the right stamp of workmen. From the information given in Appendix 5 on rates at Quetta, it would appear that rates at that place are from 33 to 50 per cent, higher than on the Jhelum and Chenab Canals of the Punjab, and we may anticipate that ordinary earthwork wall not cost more than 50 per cent, more than it did on those canals. On the other hand, the country is so favourably situated for the grading and aligning of distribution channels, having been laid down by the silt deposited by the river as it dispersed itself, that there is likely to be a saving in quantities such as will make the acreage and mileage rates of Seistan not much higher than those of the big Punjab canals. But the big canals in which the largest quantities of work must be done are certain to require a large quantity of excavation in strr, the hard alluvial of the country. In Appendix 11 a very valuable note hap been kindly contri buted by Mr. Johns. The note in Appendix 12 had been written before Mr. Johns’ note was received, the estimate of the rate being practically the same as Mr. Johns, but it was based on very meagre facts and no experience; this defect has now been made good by Mr. Johns, than whom there is no one now in India, who has had the necessary experience to give a trustworthy opinion on this important point and no one whose judgment is so sound. We may S644FD s70 [Chap. XL therefore estimate that the excavation insz^r will cost from Rs. 20 to Rs. 25 p er thousand, and therefore that the earthwork on the main line canals is likely to cost from two to three times more volume for volume than that on main line canals in the Punjab. On the other hand, it has been explained in Chapters X, XIV and Appen- dix 6 that these canals will not be so long, nor will they be in such deep cutting, or require such expensive cross drainage works, or road crossings as those in the Punjab. So that when estimating on acreage rates the cost will not differ much from that which obtains in the Punjab. Fuel, Lime, These classes of work may be conveniently dealt with together. From Appendices Sand 9 It would appear that bricks can at present be made ' in Seistan at much the same rate per Bncks ’ thousand as they are made in the Punjab provided we are not too particular about the quality ; and the demand was not so great as to exhaust the fuel. The quality could only be improved by importing moulders from India to sand mould ; this would add to the cost of the bricks, but the price of this kind of labour is bound to rise with the demand because the local supply is very limited. So experienced moulders should certainly be brought in. The scrub fuel is ample in the delta* for all works likely to be needed there Fud especially if the manufactures can be spread over wide areas, as is usually the case on canal works; and still more certainly if the manufactures are spread over some years as. the crop of scrub is renewed each year. But the largest demand for fuel is likely to be for a weir and accompanying works up the river, where the area under scrub is very limited. Our limited experience indicates that the scrub on an acre of culturable watered land would burn about one thousand bricks or 100 cubic feet of lime ; a weir with regulators t The number used on the Jhelum Canal head and mam line Works might require 2 of works see Technical Paper No. 133. ^ m illi 0 n bricks, and a million and a quarter cubic feet of lime; so that thirty square miles of scrub would be required for the bricks and a like area to burn lime and for other purposes connected with the works. The labourers would also consume a similar quantity. Then there are the demands of the cultivators for fuel and the flock and camel-owners for grazing. The 100 square miles or so required by the works would be spread over three or four years, and by starting brick manufactures some years beforehand the supply of fuel each year m.ght last out. Lime could not be manufactured till required, because it would not keep. ^ The camel-thorn grows best on lands cultivated to wheat and barley, so the minimum area available each year can be got by doubling the area of spring crop, as the fallow lands also yield Mr get the neceTsar^molItor 8 ^ * near en ° Ugh t0 the Cultivated lands “&gt; thirJp^Tfchante^XxVvnf^/ll 16 !?, 60 ? 16 ^ d ' fficu!t t0 estimat&lt; b kutfr™ the Notes P ”l wdl he seen l 1 ' he Flock - 0 ''f rs °n the ' Revenue Report and so the erLTnit bv thaMhne^ rem0Ved from these , Iand s in the autumn, on the lands nlouJhed is all aUS ^ i jriofcover, at the sowing season, the scrub on tne lands ploughed is all dug up and burnt.

Irrigation works m the delta of the Helmand suitable to the present circum stances of the people. Irrigation works in the delta of the Helmand may be considered in two Two branches of the subject. parts . first, those suitable to the present . circumstances of the country, such as would increase the area under cultivation and make it more secure without re quiring any great engineering skill to construct or administrative capacity to maintain; secondly, large works designed by the most experienced engineers to get the utmost value out of the water and administered by rulers, such as those now in India and Egypt. The first class of works will be dealt with in this Chapter. The first thing Great simplicity and antiquity of the present that strikes one about the present irriga- 9ystem ' . . , . tion system is its great simplicity and its great antiquity. Very little restraint is placed on the river, and yet the river has served the wants of man in a very satisfactory way. Notice the elaborate works described by Sir William Willcocks in Appendices 4 and 10 of this Report as hav ing existed in Mesopotamia in the days when Seistan too was at the zenith of its prosperity ; nevertheless the works in Seistan, whether ancient or modern, are of the most simple description , a few leading cuts to old channels of the river to convert them into distributaries; some miles of protection embankments of a simple kind to confine the waters of the river to its bed at flood times, and an annually con structed temporary weir of brushwood or of shingle to regulate the distribution of the supply at low river. These are all the works that exist now, and all that can be traced among the ruins of past prosperity, the remains of which cover the deserted lands and are almost as legible now as they were in the age in which they were forsaken. This simple and efficient system has not, however, been proof against the The great changes that have occurred in the effect of Small changes accumulated though course of the river. ]ong periods of ^ in evidence of this we have the fact patent on the face of the country, recorded in history and remembered in the traditions of the people that the river has deserted wude tracts in its delta in the height of their prosperity, and the population has had to migrate to the lands to which the river has gone. At what intervals of time and how often this has occurred will perhaps be known when the archaeological work under prepa ration by Mr. Tate is accomplished. But the reason why this should occur has been often explained in these notes to be due to the silt deposited by the river during the annual flood gradually raising its bed, so that the waters eventually break away to lower lands. A careful description of the changes that went on from year to year when the Rud-i-Nad-i-Ali was the main stream are given in Chapter L and Appendix 31 of the “ Revenue Report and Notes,” from which it will be seen that the river moves slowly across the delta, and during the last thirty years has travelled from the east near Nad-i-Ali and Kala-i-Kang to the west near Jalalabad and Tappa-i-Kuhlak. To such movements the people are able to at once adapt themselves owing The great merits of the present revenue and to the great elasticity of the land revenue irrigation system to meet such changes. System, and SO long as the river does not break away to a new delta they are put to no great inconvenience either indivi dually or collectively. So long as the river is allowed to shift its course year by year and spread its silt more or less evenly over the delta, there is no reason why it should break away, but as soon as protection embankments are extended and strengthened and the river constrained to remain in one channel a long time when it does eventually break away the mischief done is likely to be widespread and serious. The moral of this is that no radical alteration should be made either in the rp. r. ... present revenue or irrigation system with- 1 he eftectiveness of tamarisk weirs# 1 , , .1 J r- V out great thought. Yet the first works which every visitor to Seistan condemns are the tamarisk weirs built each year?6 [Chap.

A permanent weir would require constant thought and attention to see that r , u .,. i f the river did not desert it; this draws 9 Jt h sitl n L 0 r n a e p n e?manent “eT a ‘' y ° ' Fe ’ attention to the very unsuitable position of the present site for such a work. There are many places north of Puza-i-Kala-i- Path where the river could easily stray away on a course which would take it far from the Kuhak site. It would therefore be in the last degree rash to build a permanent structure unless authority were obtained to construct training works up the river, wherever needed to confine the river to its present course y but it will be shewn further on that the position is not a convenient one ) either for a permanent structure. These training works would lead to friction between the two countries ; the more certainly since the Afghans require to open canals along this length of the river in order to expand their cultivation to the acreage which they should do as is explained on the last page of Chapter X. As the natural direction for the expansion of Afghan cultivation is along the ^ t £ , right bank of the river north of Kala-i-Fath, The natural positions tor the heads or canals to 25 , t i i.

The Afghans have recently cut the Sultani Canal through the gap in the dasht next above Khwabgah to more efficiently irrigate the lands from Khwab- gah to Nad-i-Ali. The next favourable place for a canal head is at a point near the Ziarat Padah Sultan,* opposite to Mashi, to feed a channel along the old Zorkan canals; the floods of 1903 went down the country that wmuld be irrigated by such a system of canals. Longitudinal Section No. XXIIshows that the river is already high enough to flow in this direction and is only prevented from doing so by a ridge along its right bank just high enough to keep in all floods except very high ones like that of 1903. An examination of the map on the one inch scalef made by the irrigation t Plans on tracing doth No. lvi. P art y wi . n shew how favourable the valley of the river from Dam-i-Kalan to Kala-i* Gawak is for taking off canals for the irrigation of Afghan Seistan. The canals foi Sar-o-tar left the valley from a point 4 miles to the south-east of Kala-i* Gdwak, and a like distance to the north-east from Dam-i-Kalan ; that delta could therefore be commanded from this point since it was last irrigated from here and has been built up with the silt carried by the water of these canals. The Zorkan and Zarkan canals left the valley at the gap between the pla* teau, 6 miles to the north of Kala-i-Gawak, and all the country to Ziarat-i* runr,* tII 1 ! 3 lSthe Slte where lhe Mlsslon of i88 4 camped on 25th October and this Mission on the 19th F eb *77 Chap. XII.] Amiran could be irrigated from here. Immediately to the east of Kala-i-Gawak canals went in ancient times to the tract known as Ghulghulla.* Finally, the canals, which Irrigated the tract on which the Palangi and Paisai ruins stand, that lies to the east of Dam-i-Kalan and to the west of the sand belt, came from a weir above Band-i-Puza-i-Mashi along the right bank of the river past Puza-i-Kala-i«Fath at Sar-i*Gah-i-Seistanf ; this tract could now be irrigated from a point in the river somewhere near Dak-i-Dila. It will be seen that if a permanent structure were built, it should be placed somewhere between Dam-i-Kalan and The only safe site for permanent works of con- Kala-i-Gawak, because it would command trol in the northern delta. ’ , . . ^ , the whole ot the present irrigated delta and also the one to the east that is now a desert. The site would be safe for ages, be cause the river is naturally held in control by the features of the country ; it cannot stray to the west-because it is blocked by the high plateau all the way from Bandar-i-Kamdl Khan, except at the two narrow gaps of the trough of the Rud-i-Taraku and Rud-i-Sena, which could be made absolutely safe by simple embankments that could be made in a week. The east bank is safe to Sar-i-Gah-i-Seistan j ; from here for 6 miles there is no plateau to prevent the river breaking to the east, but there are some high ridges, the banks of ancient rivers along which powerful embankments could be made. Once escaped through these ridges, the river would go down towards Sdr-o-tdr and would not leave that delta for ages. Fortunately, the deep channel is under the western limit of the valley, and whenever it has shewn a tendency to go to the east, it has been diverted back under the plateau again by the people. At Kala-i-Gawak there is a high plateau that extends for 4 or 6 miles past the point where the water would be diverted to the lands of the delta. If therefore, the Afghans expand their cultivation, they must take off canals The great risks incurred in opening canal heads along this reach of the river, and in doing for the expansion of Afghan cultiTation. SO will build WCirS tO divert Supplies into them at low river. The present Hakim of Chakhdnsur with his 3&lt;o years of experience of the river knows how easy it will be to divert the whole river to the east by an ill-conceived work, and how difficult, and to their idea impossible, to get it back once it had gone ; so he is not likely to do anything rash. But his successors will not have his wisdom and experience to guide them. It will be seen therefore that a permanent weir should not be built at Kuhak, Th. design and construction of permanent and if One were built at all jt should works needs great skill born of experience. fog Up the river near K.ala-l-UaWaK§ at some suitable place where the water could be distributed to both Afghan and Persian lands. The description of the works for the complete control of the river in the next Chapter shews that such a work, if suitably designed and placed, could be made an integral part of the complete scheme. It must not be thought that these permanent works can be built without engineering skill, the planning of weirs, regulators and_ scouring sluices so that they maybe effective, safe, and not unduly expensive, is in itself a work tor which there are very few men who have had the needed experience. The life on building such works in India has been so arduous that the men who have constructed them have not long survived their labours, and with them has gone the most valua ble part of the experience.

We may now consider whether masonry regulators at the heads of canals ya/c may tvould be a convenience t© the people ; the Regulators for the present canal heads. people have traditions that SUCH reguktdfS existed in former times and say that there were 7 ° » the at the Sar Gah-i-Seistdn but we were unable to discover any remains of them, and it is not likely that any ever existed there; a very small masonry work, said to be a regulator, has been mentioned on the second page of Chapter IV as seen by Mr. Thfe near Burri ; with this possible exception, no masonryt regulators se«ii ever to have been used in Seistan. The people sometimes revet the heads of their^ canals with tamarisk ; the water-courses that leave the right bank of the main stream arid Rud-i-Pari£h near Shahgul where the river has great command over the land are reveted at the head. The feeder channel of the Lakhshak from the Rud-i-Nad-i* Ah is ‘provided with a tamarisk weir to limit the proportion of the volume that escapes down that channel. The ingenious regulators on the small canals in the trough ^bf the river are described on the last pnge of Chapter XXI of the Revenue Report and Notes”, and a drawing (A.) will be founddn the box. One simple and sufficient reason for not making masonry regulators at the heads of the channel on the canalised arm of the river—-this is the Rud-i-Seistan in these times—is that in high river while the band holds large volumes^ of water are forced down the canal, which must escape through the canals, and in doing so would wreck those regulators that were not properly designed. A regulator might be built at the head of the main canal to control the supply, there seems to be no objection or difficulty in doing this other than the great disadvantages given on the second page of this Chapter against a masonry weir; but it never has been done, and it is probable that a comprehensive 'control over the water to get a high duty out of it never has been attempted; and if this surmise be correct, we know within a little what must have been the greatest acreage that could be attained to, and within a little what the maximum population was in Seistan in the time of its highest development in the past. The canals from the Rud-i-Seistan are sometimes closed off in flood, and rotational turns^ would often be most desirable at low river ; our experience in India shews that such rotational turns cannot be efficiently carried out unless masonry regulators are provided ; if the full value of the water is to be got at tipffit times, the heads of all the canals frnm a channel like the Rud-i-Seiskn. * * * § * This is rot likely to be serious; if the bed rises much, the works to irrigate the Hauzdar tract could be made cheaper ; in any case it is not a difficult matter to effectually close off the Taraku and Sena»Rud troughs. f On the Zorkan and Zarkan canals whose beds had risen high above the country brick masonry water course heads were used. ( The head of the Jai Surkh Nawar water-course was in masonry, because there was a dangerousdraw into this depression. On some ancient canals, perhaps older than those for Sar-o- tar, revealed in the wind scours to the east of Dam-i-Kalan, a colaba (earthenware pipe) under a canal was found. r J In 1903 the volume down the Rud-i-Seistiin rose to 5,863 cusecs, even though the band, had been swept away ; ordinarily about 2,500 or 3,000 cusecs is the maximum discharge. § This is sometimes attempted—see the note on the year 1895 in Appendix 24 of the “ Revenue Report and Notes .79 Chap. XII. ] including that of the channel itself, should be provided with a masonry regulator to control the supply, but it would not be wise to build such works on an uncertain channel like the Rud-i-Parian, though regulators would be very useful at the tail of the Nad-i-Ali Channel below Burj-i-As to divide the water to the Lakhshak, Deh Dost Muhammad and Sikhsar and Charkh systems. These works need only be very simple walls with a sufficient revetment on the bed. The masonry would be built by the cultivators, who would contribute their own labour to the brick-making, but would require to recompense the masons by a grant from the grain at harvest. Timber for gates to close the heads would be a great difficulty : doubtless the ingenious Seistani would contrive something from tamarisk poles and wattles. The dearth of timber must have had a great influence in the past on the irrigation system. The present system of temporary porous tamarisk weirs (band) would continue to be used, to control the river, if the site of the band had to be moved elsewhere it might or might not be neces sary to build a new regulator to the Rud-i-Seistan. Such regulators are used on the Punjab Inundation Canals. There is little doubt but that an adviser from India would forthwith provide masonry works at the heads of these channels and make contoured maps and lay the country out in squares ; and it is equally certain the Seistani has attained his prosperity in the past without such works. It is difficult for those trained on books, maps, contours, facts and figures to realise the intuitive knowledge possessed by these people of all that concerns the irrigation of this delta. They have an inherited natural aptitude for observing all that concerns -the water ; nor is it strange that it should be so since the river is the lifeblood of the country, without it existence would be impossible. We must remember that our science has been attained by the earnest study of local problems in India by many faithful men, and it can only be applied successfully in Seistan if we in our turn loyally study this country ; the Seistani will be found an enthusiastic and skilled guide. Many small schemes are in hand in the country, the Miankangf is gradually t being reclaimed ; this has often been referred to in the ‘ Revenue Report and Notes. Now that the boundary is definitely laid down, plans are already matured to reclaim the land about Takht-i-Shah. The natural instinct of the people guides them to the direction from which to bring the water for irrigation and where to place the protection embankments. A canal referred to in a foot note at the end of Chapter III to reclaim and irrigate the Chah Muhammad Raza depression is also being considered, this canal would pass to the west of the depression and so form its own reclamation embank ment the irrigation being all on the east bank down into the depression. The canal would be brought from the Warmal system of canals through a narrow gap in the Puza-i-Adil Shah where there is an ancient kariz. The road from Lutak to Chah- i-Muhammad Raza runs along this kariz. Old Dadi, Kadkhuda, is the engineer of the scheme, and Yamin-i-Nizam, the organiser. A work that should be within the skill of the people to make is a flood The feasibility of a flood escape at Bandar- escape down the Rud-i-Taraku from Bandar- i-KamaiKhan. i-Kamal Khan. The flood of 1903 was kept back by a line of sand-hills, otherwise some part of it would have spilt down that channel and so relieved the channels in the northern delta. At present the people exclude floods from this channel in the interest of the small area of culti vation on the Bandar-i-Kuhna or Taraku canal, and the more experienced because they fear the result of a flood going down that channel. Floods could be spilt down this channel with safety a simple weir were built to prevent the flood water scouring out a channel which would develope to a size capable of taking the river away in that direction. The flood of 1885 scoured no channel because only thick silt laden water w r ent down, but some big floods are almost clear snow water which tear at the beds like a plough ; to pass these with safety a weir is required. This water would replenish the wells and produce grazing in the Ram Rud tract and do much to improve the route from Seistan to Quetta ; the waters8 o [Chap.

Each little community works only tor its own good. The Hakim of Chakhansur, Akhunzada Fakir Muhammad, with his great experience, has built a great mileage of protection embankments and made many canals ; and in cases where his energy and foresight are in advance 0 tha of the Baluchi he governs, he has incurred unpopularity by the extra labour he requires from them. He is well aware of the danger incurred at these places, and since the tracts in question are in his charge the neglect to ma e embankments at these places may be deliberate ; all suffer some loss of cultivation in the great floods and look to these spill channels for a measure of ame ' ora ,' tion. The wise men among them, no doubt, know some years beiorehan when the river is getting dangerously high at any place; if the Government is sympathetic, these men are consulted and the needed works are carried out wi enthusiasm ; if the danger coincides with a period of political disorganization, e protection works are neglected and the breach occurs.82 CHAPTER XIII.

Works required to gain complete control of the water of the Helmand River for the irrigation oj its delta. ^ The head of the Helmand delta is at Bandar-i-Kamal Khdn,* the natural position for works to control the distribution of the river to the delta. The site is very favourable for works to obtain complete control of the waters, and the levels of the present river are favourable for the economical construction of these works. The trough or depression called the Rud-i-Taraku that leaves the main river just below Kala-i*Kamal Khan gives a natural line for canals to the Hauzdar Ramrud tract: and the trough called the Rud-i-Kuchk, which leaves the Rud-i*Taraku at Kala-i-Afzal, 6 miles down-stream of Kala-i-Kam&amp;l Kh&amp;n, provides a convenient channel for an escape direct to the Gaud-i-Zireh. Two methods of dealing with the surplus flood waters are open to us—one Two possible schemes. is t0 divide t 1 ] 6111 at Bandar-i-Kaiiidl Khan, so as to send some portion of the flood to be dissipated from the broad shallow basins of the Sabari and Puzak Hamun, at the same time securing the silt for the land. The second is to send all the surplus water to the Gaud-i-Zireh and with it all the silt. The former scheme will be described first, then the second, while doing so the relative advantages and difficulties of both will be brought out at each point. ; Description of the first scheme. In the first scheme the main stream of the Helmand River would end at Kala-i-Kam&amp;l Khan, where it would be divided into two streams—one going north along the present main river to the northern basins, and the other going west as far as Kala-i*Afzal where it would turn south to the Gaud-i-Zireh. It would be quite easy, though expensive, to carry the whole or any portion .. , of the river to the northern basin; before Lines for escapes through cultivated lands. , . 1,111, 1 any works were planned the deltas to be irrigated would be levelled over at close intervals and suitable lines would be chosen in the northern delta along which to carry the escapage from the main stream to the Hamun-i-Puzak, Sabari and Kuh-i-Khwaja. When these lines of escape had been chosen the lines for the canals to irrigate the tracts between the lines of escape would be selected. The lines of escapef would be chosen to provide water-way sufficient to carry their share of a great flood like that of 1885 ; if necessary reserve lines of escape could also be selected into which flood water could be turned when the usual escapes were overpowered ; the crops growing along these reserve^ lines of escape would of course be destroyed, but the loss would be localised and under control; if some such provision were not made, costly masonry works and valuable villages would probably be destroyed. The primary object of such a scheme would be to convey the flood waters to the Northern Hamiin to be spread out in the basins to be dissipated by The importance of a knowledge of the correct evaporation. If this is not done, there is, rate of evaporation. as has been explained at page 103 of Chapter XV, danger of the Gaud-i-Zireh Hamun becoming too full in years^ of successive big floods like 1865, 1866 and 1895, 1896 and a possibility amounting almost to certainty of losing control over the floods in a year of extraordinary flood like 1885. Were this not so, the simpler solution would be that of the second scheme; the inundated area in the northern basin would then only receive flood water from the other rivers, and the drainage works to deal with this would be com paratively small. * It will be convenient to talk of the head of the delta as at Bandar-i-Kamal Khan, as this is the best known place, the position for a weir would be at Deh Ghulam Haidar about one mile and a half down-stream of the ruined fort of Kala-i-Kamal Khan, and also of the ford known as Guzar-i-Bandar-i-Kam&amp;l Khan. f It would probably suffice to cut the banks into these escapes, the place for the gap being Suitably pitched. J Such reserve lines of escape exist now in the Rud-i-Seistan tract in the escape that passes Afzalabad coming from Muhammadabad, and the escape that passes Pir Sabz coming from Chiling.84 [Chap. XIII, But this scheme could only be undertaken if it were certain that the Gaud-i. Zireh could safely hold all the water of a great flood. A correct knowledge 0 { the rate of evaporation on the Gaud-i-Zireh is most important, if this rate were 10 feet a year, there would be no danger in passing all the surplus water to the Gaud-i-Zireh ; but if the rate is only five feet a year, there is danger of the Gaud- i-Zireh overflowing in large volume into the northern basin and wrecking the reclamation embankments and destroying the cultivation • All the information about the rate of evaporation has been fully discussed in Chapter VI and the problem of draining the inundated area will be fully described in the fifteenth Chapter; it is only necessary here to emphasise the very great importance of obtaining an accurate knowledge of the rate of evaporation off the inundated area; this information is as essential as that of the volume of water poured in by all the rivers. The first point to be decided under this scheme will be the abolition or retention of the Naizar discussed towards Abolition or retention of the Naizar. t he end of Chapter XV. It will be po S . sible to control the flood waters so as to keep an area^in the Naizar under reeds: it will also be possible to drain and reclaim the Naizar. It is probable that either system will be equally feasible under this scheme and that there will not be much difference of cost. If the Naizar is maintained, a large part of the flood volume of the Helmand must be conveyed to the Northern Hamun ; the Naizar cannot be maintained from the flood waters of the Kh£sh, Far&amp;h and Harud, as they are too uncertain in their volume, and are not likely to be brought under control at the same time as works are undertaken for that purpose on the Helmand. We may now consider the works required under the first scheme. It has r . ,, „ , been said in the footnote of the first paee Works required for firs, scheme. of ^ ^ ^ J ^ weir on the present river would be across the river opposite Deh Ghulam Haidar; the ford of Bandar*i-Kamal Khan and the ruins of Kala-i-Kamal Khan are situated above the entrance of the Rud-i-Taraku trough, while the Gumbad-i* Nadiri on the left bank of the river opposite Deh Ghulam Haidar marks the down-stream entrance of the trough. The river-bed from Kala-i-Mir, one mile above Guzar-i-Bandar-i-Kamdl Khan to Guzar-i-Gumbad, 4 miles below the ford and nearly 2 miles below Deh Ghulam Haidar, has a very low gradient, the fall being only 4-J feet in the 5 miles. The material of the bed is uniform through* out this reach and is shingle with small boulders. The works required to gain control of the river and to send the surplus waters partly to the Northern Hamun and partly to the Gaud-i-Zireh would be as follows (i) At Deh Ghulam Haidar a regulating weir with gates across the present river ; perhaps a regulator across the head of the Tarakd Channel to keep control of that also. (ii) At Kala-i-Afzal a weir over which to control the escapage to the Gaud-i-Zireh, and a regulator at the head of the canal to the delta formerly watered by the Rud-i-Taraku. Scouring sluices will be required on the weir in front of the canal head. (iii) Weirs and regulators would also be required at the point in the northern delta where the branch of the river coming from Deh Ghulam Haidar ended, and the water was distributed by escapes to the basins and by canals to the land. As has already been pointed out on page 77 tb e test Chapter, this point would be somewhere between Dam-i-Kalan and Kala-i-Gawak. All the above weirs and regulators would be like those on rivers and canals of similar size in Northern India. (iv) From the weir at Deh Ghulam Haidar to the weir and regulators near Dam-i-Kalan for distributing the waters over the northern e ta the channel of the present main stream would suffice with* out any works as Jar as can now be foreseen. But some excava tion will be required on the channel from Deh Ghulam Haidar to areas Jould bYdifferentlate? ^omsafe^'n^hlbiutiois and Th S be flo ° ded at Such timeS ’ aS ^Mhe floods. naoitations and other valuable properties placed out of the reach ofChap. XIII.] 85 Kala-i-Afzal and in the head reach of the Rud-i-Kuchk, which will be referred to further on in detail. (v) Canals will be required for distributing the water both over the north ern delta and over the Hauzdar Ramrud delta. These works should be less expensive than those on Northern Indian canals, because the land has been laid down by a process of warping from channels, so there is a natural gradient for the canals and water-courses. (vi) Escape channels to the northern basin through the northern delta and an escape or drainage channel to the Gaud-i-Zireh—these will be natural channels and should require no important works. They will bean unusual feature; even in Madras, so far as is known, it has not been found necessary to interfere with the channels by which the river escaped to the sea when the irrigation works were started. ^ (vii) Protection embankments would be required along the escape chan nels to the northern basin as at present; such embankments are built in Egypt along the branches of the Nile, but are not required on perennial irrigation schemes in Northern India, though they are well known and understood on the inundation canals from the Indus. Protection embankments might also be required up the river. The great flood of 1885 covered all the arable land in the Trough, and it would be of no avail to build embankments to pro tect lands from such a flood. Especially as the construction of these works would make the flood levels higher below Chahar Burjak than they were in 1885. No embankments exist in this part of the river; General Ferrier mentions some on the river above Kala-i-Bist. Any works required along the river may be considered to be debitable to schemes for developing cultivation along the trough. (viii) Works would be required to reclaim the Naizar, or control the floods to the Naizar, as well as works to drain the basins, so that they should always be at a minimum level at flood time and so minimise the danger of the reclamation embankments being breached. These works would be entirely novel; so far as is known there are no works of this sort known to Indian Irrigation Engineers, though it is probable they are common on the deltas of rivers that end in the big lakes of Europe or America. The works proposed on the Kashmir lakes must be very similar to what would be required in Seistan. Description of works required. We may now consider these works in detail. The design of the works at Design of channel between the works at Deh Deh Ghulam Haidar Khan and at Kala-1- Ghuiam Haidar and Kaia-i-Afzai. Afzal would require much caretul consider ation. An examination of the sections will shew that the fall m the river at Bandar-i-Kamal Khan is now 15 feet a mile, while the average fall from Guzax-i- Menai to Deh Ghulam Haidar along 14 miles of the river is about two and halt feet a mile; while the fall down the old Rud-i-Taraku is about 3 feet a mile and down the Rud-i-Kuchk about 3’5 feet a mile. If a weir is built at Deh Ghulam Haidar with crest level at or about the level of the rapid at this place, it will be necessary to grade the first 6 miles of the Rud-i-Taraku that would be used as a mam river, and the first s miles of the \Rud-i-Kuchk, that would carry the floods to the Gaud-i-Zireh, at a slope of about one foot a mile, even so the excavation would be about to feet deep on the average throughout this 10 or 12 miles. The fall of the river above Bandar-i-Kamal Khan being about two and half feet a mile in bi^ floods the shingle moves with the flood as far down the river as Guzar-T-Gumbad about a mile! below the site of the proposed weir fourth nape of Appendix 2=; of the “Revenue Report and Notes. ) ihls shingk P might drop in the channel graded at a foot a “‘^“f.^/^ncTen! if not impossible, to move on. In our designs we channels at this part of the river; these have a fall of about ttoe feet a m l on the average ; when the weir is built the same conditions may obtain as existed S644FD86 [Ctmp. xiii, when the channels flowed. A careful examination of the material in the bed of the existing river and the ancient channels will indicate what gradient exactly should be given. The longitudinal slope of tjie river is a curve o gradually decreasing declivity ; when the bed is examined in detail it is found to be broken up into rapids and shallows by boulder bars where the slope is great &gt; smngle bars where it is moderate ; and sand bars where it is small. The river in flood pours material over a bar and forms deposits just as it does in a delta ; each bar is in fact a fan. The works must be so designed that these bars and shallow's shall form where required. Mr. R. A. Molloy’s invaluable work on the “ Physics of the River Indus,” Technical Paper No. 118, explains this most lucidly, and was of great help to me in Seistan.* To obtain a gradient anything like that which obtains in the old channels, the weir crest will need to be raised consi- The works at Deh Ghuhm Haidar. derably above the present level of the bed at Deh Ghulam Haidar; the length of Channel to be graded is 10 or 12 miles, so that a rise of six feet will only add half a foot a mile to the gradient. It will probably be found that a slope of two feet a mile in this reach wall suffice; if so, the weir crest will be 12 feet above the present bed. The rapid at Guzar-i* Gumbad, nearly 2 miles below Deh Ghulam Haidar, can be strengthened and even raised to reduce the head on the weir and to prevent the retrogression of levels. A great saving of very expensive excavation will be effected by thus raising the weir. If a suitable channel is cut for 10 miles at an average depth of 10 feet, it might easily cost 40 lakhs of rupees, as the soil is the hard sirr estimated in Appendix 11 to cost Rs. 20 to 25 a 1,000 cubic feet to excavate. With the high weir the quantity of excavation will be nominal and will probably be nearly all in easily cleared sand or soil. But suitable gradients and sections are more important than the first cost; as stated above, these should be studied on the spot; the maps and sections obtained by this Mission will afford invaluable information when com. pared writh the state of the river at the time of re-survey, more especially if the record of the phases of the river and its discharges is systematically maintained in the meantime. The cost of the weir at Deh Ghulam Haidar will largely depend on the state of this part of the river-bed when the weir comes to be built. It will be seen from Appendix 25, already referred to, that great changes may occur at a great flood while small changes go on continuously. The particular object of this weir will be to regulate the volume of water to be passed to the northern basin down the present river; since there will be a large overfall, the weir will require to be surmounted with a regulator filled with gates through which the supply needed for the northern delta will be passed, the balance going down to Kala-i-Afzal; to be regulated on at that place, the work will in fact be of the nature of a canal fall and regulator. The channel down the Rud-i-Taraku to Kala-i-Afzal w'ill be so high above that to the northern delta that a weir should not be required across that channel to keep control of the floods. At low river training works may be needed to keep the main stream past t e regulator to the northern delta, similar to those needed to feed the eastern an western canals on the Jamna River. This cannot be decided till the designs ar, n u° rve • 0U j r anC V t ^ as ^ een d e termined exactly what proportion of the flood W1 e require or the northern delta; it will then be evident whether this can be got without a regulator across the river. The works at Kala-i-Afzal will be a weir with shutters across the head of Works at Kaia-i-Afzdi.

XIII.] 87 to the delta. The works will be exactly similar to those of a perennial canal on a river, and scouring sluices will be required in front of the canal head to keep the channel free from silt. ^ It may be decided when plans are matured to pass escapage down the Rud- i-Taraku to the Kuhd-Khwaja Hamun ; if so, the works will be more extensive and complicated, as the canal will need to be separate from the escape; its bed will be graded to get command, while the escape will follow the bed of the depression. The works near Dam-i-Kalan will be simple in character and inexpensive, as Works near Dam-i-Kaian. ^ volume to be passed by them will be regulated from the works at Deh Ghulam Haidar. The present river has complete command of the whole of the delta north of Kala-i-Fath from any point between Dam-i-Kalan and Kala-i-Gawak ; it has been pointed out on page 77 of the last Chapter that there are admir able sites near Kala-i-Gawak for works to distribute the supply to this delta ; and channels from here could command all the lands to the north, while the lands to the south could be irrigated by a small canal taking out of the river near Chaharburjak. It is fortunate that it will not be necessary to take out a left bank canal from above the works at Deh Ghulam Haidar, because double canals one on each bank—will lead to increased loss by evaporation on the minimum supply; moreover, the lie of the land on the left bank of the river is very un suitable for aligning a canal at all economically. If the loss of water at minimum river between the works at Deh Ghulam Haidar and Dam-i-Kalan is found to be great, an artificial feeder channel could be cut at small expense along some suit able depression on the right bank of the river from one work to the other to carry this minimum supply. Little need be said about the canals and escape channels—items v and vi Canal, and ..cap. channel.. °[ 8 S ! the characteristic of a delta is the existence of sharp ridges and clear cut drainage lines side by side, and there should be no difficulty in aligning and constructing channels suitable for the purpose required. When the Godaveri works were constructed at the end of the forties the old native channels were used for the distributaries. Colonel Baird Smith on a visit from the Ganges Canal inspected these and considered it would be much more economical in the end to have constructed new ones—see his note at page 131 of the “Godaveri Works” by Walch. In Seistan so many of the canals are naturally straight and direct that it does not seem possible that they can be open to the same objection. The protection embankments will not be extensive or costly ; because the lines of the escape channels will be deliber ately chosen along the lowest ground. Protection embankments. The works required to reclaim the Naizar will be large and difficult; in „ , . Chapter XV these have been discussed from the point of view of all the water of the Helmand going, as at present, to the Northern Hamun, but with an escape through the Rud-i-Kuchk to the Gaud-i-Zireh the volume to be dealt with in the northern inundated'area will be very much more under control, as the floods that arrive from the Helmand will be under complete control. But the drains, though smaller in width, will still be long, and the greater part of the soil through which they are cut will be the hard strr. Masonry regulators are sure to be needed at points of control, as the volumes will not be so large ; these should not be individually expensive, but many are likely to be needed and the total cost is likely to be large. The protection embankments will not be very expensive, as it should be possible to deal with a flood like that of 1885 in the Gaud-i-Zireh ; one of the main objects of passing flood water annually to the Northern Hamun to be there dissipated by evaporation is to insure that the level of the water in the Gaud-i- Zireh will always be so low that an extraordinary flood like that of 1885 can be held, and the Northern Hamun saved from a volume of w r ater in excess of the capacity of the drainage and protection works provided.88 [Chap.

These lines would be laid out, as already suggested, on a previous page of this Chapter to follow the lowest ground to the deepest basins; it would probably suffice to have them clearly marked out by suitable embankments, Description of works required in the second scheme. We may now discuss these works seriatim. The embankment to close the valley would be built at the favourable site The embankment. about a ^ and a ha]f below Deh Ghu l am Haidar, where the river passes between two plateaux of dasht sufficiently high to be above the level of the flood of 1885. The channel is here about a mile and a quarter wide. The Gumbad-i-Nadiri are up-stream of the site on the lelt bank and the Dam-i-Kuhna with a moat is on or close to the site on the right bank. The Cross Section 17 R. L. given on plan of levels No. XXV (a) (z) was taken near this site. The flood of 1885 rose 30 feet above the bed of the river in this part ol the valley; this occurred when the road to the north and to the west were open to it; if the former were closed and all the water forced down the Rud-i-Kuchk, the flood would rise even higher, so that the embankment must be built to the full height of the plateaux here, and mature deliberation might indicate that a retired embankment right across the valley should also be raised. These excessive floods only come at long intervals of time, so that the upper part of the embankment would have time to suffer from weather; a core wall oj masonry preferably concrete would be a necessity. On page 91 towards the end of this Chapter it is shewn that the high level canal to command the Dasht*i*ZirenChap. XIII.] 89 should cross the (then dry) channel of the present river at this bank on its course along the right bank of the (then) river. It might be possible to bring this canal along or near this embankment and use its water to consolidate it. The position for the embankment is so far below the line of flow from Bandar-i-Kamdl Kh^n down the Riid-i-Taraku to Kala-i-Afzal that a great pool would be formed here which would require to be filled up by warping with silt laden water; when this had been properly done the site would become strong. Since the flood of 1885 escaped down the old river channel under the cliffs along which the Deh Ghulam Haidar Branch of the Chaharburjak Canal now flows from below the latter place to near the former, this outlet would need to be properly closed off. It might be found on full consideration a good line for a high flood escape to the northern basin to feed the reserve escapes that have been suggested on a previous page of this Chapter. From Discharge Sheet Plan No. B2 it will be seen that only about 30,000 cusecs flowed down this channel in the great flood of 1885 ; this is not much, but if these works were constructed, the level of such a flood would be much higher in this trough than it was in 1885, and a greater volume could be escaped down this depression if needed. If the valley were blocked as suggested in this scheme, the level of the river canal could be fed from here without a weir, but training banks and spurs would doubtless be needed hi some years to divert the requisite supply to the canal head. There is a convenient narrow place in the dasht about half a mile north of Deh Ghulam Haidar which has been cut through in ancient times for a passage for an ancient canal and which is now made use of for the Deh Ghulam Haidar Branch j this would afford a convenient site for the head regulator of the northern canal. The permanent canal to the north would begin here; up-stream of the regulator a more or less temporary feeder canal would be made in the bed of the river to be fed by the training banks already alluded to. The canal to the northern delta would not present any special features. up the tract and probably lead to extra channels. But falls would probably be required in the main_ line, because the river level at Deh Ghulam Haidar in this scheme would be higher than in the first scheme ; in the latter fall would be wasted along the bed of the present river.

The levels down the Rud-i-Kuchk given on level sheets No. XlXa and XIX£ were taken by Mr. W. A. Johns, Railway Reconnaissance Officer to the Mission ; no one but Mr. Johns and Rai Bahadur Gopal Singh of the Survey of India, who did the plane-table work, has seen the Rud-i-Kuchk; this is the Baluchi name on the Survey of India map ; in the early reports and maps it is called Johns’ Nala because he discovered and brought it to notice. It is advisable to explain this much here, as most careful measurements will be required of these two channels to see whether they can be relied on to carry away a large flood like that of 1885 without causing a dangerous heading up of the river at Deh Ghulam Haidar such as would over-power the works at that point. It is almost certain from the Survey of India plans given of these channels, and from what I have seen of the Rud-i-Taraku on my ride from Bandar-i-Kamal Khan to Kala-i-Tarakii, that they will carry the flood volume alright. The slope in them is greater than it is in the river below Kala-i-Mir and the cross sectional area seems ample, but there are not sufficient measurements of the cross sec tional area of the Rud-i-Taraku and none of the Rud-i-Kuchk to prove this. from the river at Deh Ghulam Haidar; a bably be less than in the first scheme, because the country would not be cut up by flowing rivers which would divide Canals to the northern delta.

If this scour takes place, it can be localised byr suitable works, so that it does not endanger the stability of the works at Ka a-i-Afzal It is certain that in the course of ages it must all silt up again, as all the silt of the Helmand will be taken to the Gaud-i-Zireh and a great delta Ultimate silting up of the RUd-i-Kuchk. ^ f orme( ^ there. This is the great difficulty that hangs over this scheme ; the raising of a delta in the Gaud-i-Zireh which will not only reduce the capacity of that basin but in course of ages raise the level of the river all the way up to Deh Ghulam Haidar till those works are overpowered. I n Chapter XV111 some schemes for dealing with the silt in the Bel- mand by works to be constructed in the hills from which the river obtains water will be discussed. Ihese schemes may not appear practical, but they will greatly reduce the silt brought into the basin by reducing the volume of silt laden water, and no other method of retarding the silting up of the Gaud-i-Zireh, while it takes direct the whole of the surplus volume of the river suggests itself. The works at Kala-i-Afzal will be of the usual description required in such situations ; the weir will probably be longer in this scheme than in the first scheme, but the difference in cost of the works at this spot under the two schemes is not likely to be very great. It might prove useful to add the escape towards the Kuh-i-Khwdja Hdmun suggested on page 87 to this scheme ; if so, it would modify the whole scheme, as this water would find its way back to the northern basins and add to the difficulty of the drainage and reclamation works. The canals to irrigate the delta fed by the Rud-i-Tarakii are not likely to c&amp;nais to irrigate the delta fed by the Rud-i« differ in any important respect from those Tarakti - that feed the northern delta and should be comparatively inexpensive works.

If any such works are required, they will be embankments closing off depressions in the delta of the Rud-i-Taraku near the head of the Sar-i-Shela, and providing a regulator to that channel, so that the waters do not escape to the Kuh-i-Khwaja Hdmun uncontrolled and before it is necessary that they should.

But the i; regular flooding would not suffice to make a Naizar ofChap.

When works of this magnitude had been carried out on the Helmand, the Fardh and Khash would also be brought under control, and it is possible that a Naizdr might be made in their delta, if desired ; while it is certain that the water could be so drained away that little or no Naizdr would remain.

In describing the works required to control the River Helmand for the irrigation of the modern delta nothing has been said about canals for the irriga tion of the ancient deltas lying at a higher level which are coloured brown on the map. These areas could not be effectively commanded from the works constructed at Deh Ghulam Haidar and Kala-i-Afzal: though the levels indicate that a canal might be taken out at Kala-i-Afzal which would command that portion of the Dasht-i-Zireh to the south-west of Kala-i-Taraku, and if so the water would command the lower southern portion of this fan, leaving the high north-east part uncommanded, this could only be commanded by a high level canal coming from the direction of Kala-i-Afzal. It might also be possible to command low lands {ndwdr) in the bed of the Riid-i-Sena, and along the left bank of the river north of Dak-i-Dila by a canal taking out above the works at Deh Ghulam Haidar. But to effectively command the Dasht-i-Zireh, the tract that lies between the c ., , , , , . . , Rud-i-Taraku, Rud-i-Kuchk and Gaud-i- Site for head and alignment of canal. rr , , . , . , , , . Zireh, which is the largest and best situated of these areas, it would be necessary to go up the river to the rapid on the ford at Deh Menai, the site of the head of the Bandar-i-Nau Canal. A canal from here would get command of the Dasht-i-Zireh near Kala-i-Afzal. The aligning of this canal would present some difficulty; at first the canal would doubtless hug the river just as the present Bandar-i-Nau Canal does. Then it must cross the lower dasht that forms the river bank ; fortunately an ancient canal has been dug in this dasht and is utilised by the Bandar-i-Nau Canal; this would effect a small saving in this part of its length, but at Kala-i-Roden the canal must either be put in high embankment over the cultivated lands or be cut out of the alluvial cliff. Perhaps the best solution will be to tunnel through the promontory of high dasht on a direct line to Kala-i-Afzal, thus saving excava tion and head of command. At Kala-i-Afzal the canal must be carried across the Rud-i-Kuchk which will be carrying the escapage to the Gaud-i-Zireh. This can be done on an aqueduct of some magnitude. This canal should send out a branch across the Riid-i-Taraku somewhere between Gumbad-i-Nadiri and Kala-i-Kharan for the irrigation of the high lying, but commandable lands, on the left bank of the present river: this branch will also need an aqueduct across the river. But once the two branches are across their respective rivers the alignment should be very simple and the command good. The excavation will doubtless be in sirr, because all the friable soil has been blown off these plains by the wind. We may here pause to reflect whether this soil will be culturable; there is about a foot of decayed soil over-lying the Whether soil on the dasht undecomposed alluvial {sirr) ; into this the thin layer of gravel will be ploughed, giving it a good open texture, so that good crops should be raised. The Seistani cultivator recovers the hard bed of reclaimed chung and such depressions as Chah-i-Nima and Jai Surkh Naw£r. He says the yield for the first year or two is not good, probably because there are no bacilli friendly to agriculture, and until these are gradually introduced the crops are not good ; the same thing occurs when canal borrow pits are cultivated in the Punjab. The bacilli can be introduced with well rotted village manure of which there is sure to be lots or by a sprinkling of soil from cultivated lands. These are the only high level main canals likely to be required; all lands The alignment for the high level canal if the worth cultivating can probably be got at second scheme is adopted from either of these two branches. If the whole river were diverted down to the Gaud-i-Zireh as suggested on page 88, it92 [Chap. XIII, night be cheaper to bring this canal down the right bank of the river round the embankment which^would be built at Dam-i-Kuhna. possibly across it, and then past Kala-i-Kuhna to Kala-i-Afzal atKala i Afzal the canal would cross the low level canal in the trough of the Rud-i-Taraku to reach the Dasht- i-Zireh, but the aqueduct would be much shorter than that needed across the Rud-i-Kuchk. The main river would not need to be crossed by either branch of this canal, nor would there be any tunnel required ^ through the The land on the right bank of the river is high and is siWy but the depth of excavation would probably be reasonable and the channel not unduly expensive. The canal to the northern delta would need to be crossed somewhere near its head. At the same time the high level canal would serve the lands along the right bank of the river which are too high for the canal to the northern delta to reach : to do this irrigation it might send out a branch as far as Kala* i-Fath. If the first scheme were carried out, this canal might still be taken along the right bank of the river to Deh Ghulam Haidar and^ carried across the river, and taken along the right bank of the Rud-i-Tarakti to Kala-i-Afzal, where it would cross the canal to the Hauzdar tract. These works might be cheaper than those on the direct route along the left bank of the river, though the distance is longer. The possibility of escaping surplus •water over the high commandable plateau to fill the depressions in the dasht. At the end of Chapter XVI it has been suggested that it might be possible , , , to utilise the depressions in the high Nature o t e pro em. plateau as basins to catch silt from very thick silt laden water of rain floods, some part of the water being subsequently used for irrigation; and it is shewn that the chief obstacle to their probable use is the difficulty of reaching them, because they are locked in by high plains of tough alluvial, expensive to excavate. A possible way to reach all these depressions is to take out a high level escape which will follow the old channels that flowed when these alluvial plateau were watered. An examination of the beautiful topographical maps of the Survey of India— The lateaux these are not before me as 1 write, but I saw the plane-table sheets in Seistdn—will shew that there is a very high plateau which has been coloured bright red on the 4-mile to the inch contoured map (Plan No. XIV in the box of drawings); this plateau is very high and not commandable; it is perhaps of the same age the Dasht-i-Margo, and if so, it has been cut off by the Helmand trough and as Rud-i-Taraku which are now at a great depth below either the Dasht-i-Margo or this plateau. Below this high plateau are lower plateau coloured brown on our contoured map, which represent successive stages of an ancient river, as it cuts its way down from the level which commanded the highest plateau to where we find the Helmand now. It might be possible to make the high level canal already described, large The high level canal. enough to_ carry the large volume of flood water required to fill the depressions that Can j-n r . eac ^ e ^ . r ® m ^ ese troughs in the plateaux ; if so there would be no modification required of schemes one or two except in the size and scope of the high level canal, which would require to have a weir at its head to control the supply and need to be much more carefully aligned and graded.

Levels were taken to get information of the relative level of these ancient Reconnaissance survey mate. plateaux and the troughs and depressions within them, so that the nature of the pro blem might be explained, but such work was made secondary to that of framing a conservative estimate of the value of the delta of the Helmand as an agricul tural proposition ; by the time schemes are seriously considered to exploit this valuable supply of water the administrators and engineers in India will have obtained such experience from the great works now being started that they may prefer to begin in Seistan with a high level scheme; if so, there is informa tion enough in the plans and sections to shew the nature of the problem to be solved. Besides the longitudinal section of the Rud-i-Sena (Longitudinal Section No. XX), which is the most modern, and the lowest of these old river troughs, there is a longitudinal section (No. IV^ among the plans in the box) by Babu Ghulam Kadir of the trough along the left bank of the main river from Dak-i- Dila to its termination in the Chah-i-Nima depression, a little north of our Camp at Kuhak, the trough* splits up at our Camping Ground, some of its branches spilling over the edge of the dasht, and some going to the Chah-i-Nfma depres sion. It will be seen from what has been said, and from an examination of these sections and special project section 4(^), that the height through which the supply must be raised is great. It is evident too that the river has command over the troughs of the plateau in the area coloured brown and shewn as com- mandable, but the works will be large and expensive. If this tract were situated in the centre of India, there can be no doubt that the works could be made to pay, because the value of the water stored in high level reservoirs instead of lying waste in deep depressions like the Gaud-i-Zireh would be very great. The works to close the valley and raise the supply level in the river would Cost of works largely increased by the provision be Simple if the maximum flood discharge to be made for extraordinary floods. were Only 100,000 CUSCCS, but the certainty of a flood of six or seven times this volume once and possibly twice in a century makes the design of the works much more onerous. It is evident from Ap pendix 25 of the “ Revenue Report and Notes’ 5 that the damage done by the flood of 1885 was trifling, chiefly because there was very little except crops and village sites to damage. The effect of such a flood would be very different if the channels were restricted in size by massive badly conceived masonry works. Now that we have full knowledge of this flood we can design the works accord ingly, and it is not likely that the damage done to them by such a flood will be great, or that the works will be unreasonably expensive. But the reflection arises that works to control and restrain the flood w T ater, so that it passed off gradually and did not come down the valley in so great a volume would be of very great value. The possibility of thus moderating the floods will be discussed in Chapter XVIII. • The deeper parts of such troughs are called Jdi by the Seistanis. S644FD AACONTENTS.

From what has been said in Chapter XI about the probable cost of labour in Seistan it will be seen that the rates of work will be higher than those on the Punjab canals ; but, on the other hand, the head-works are closer to the tracts to be irrigated, so that the length of expensive main line will be less ; again, though much of the excavation of the main line will be in the very hard sirr, yet its depth will not be so great as is usual on the main lines of the big Northern Indian canals from which we must get our experience of the cost of such works. The expenditure on cross drainage works will be in comparison insignificantly small; but the expense of draining the inundated area is likely to absorb all the savings obtained from the greater facilities just described for leading out the water on to the land. For these drainage works are themselves a big project, and though land will be reclaimed thereby, yet that land is needed to get the full culturable area required, and on none of our Indian projects that I know of have we had to go to expense to reclaim land for irrigation. Doubtless, if the drainage works could be replaced by impounding reservoirs in the valley, credit could be taken for this expenditure, as the works would then yield some additional income; the possibilities of such reservoirs will be described in the last Chapter of this Report. Detailed information obtained from the Punjab canals of the rate per cusec of maximum supply, and of that on the average annual area irrigated, are given on the first page of Appendix 6 of this Report; it is there shewn that for the reasons above given the works are likely to be as expensive as those of the Sirhind Canal. That canal cost Rs. 6,424 per cusec of designed full supply and Rs. 4T9 per acre of average annual irrigation. The maximum supply of the Helmand Canal is likely to be 10,000 cusecs, and the average annual area 1,000,000 acres, so that on the first figures the cost of the works are likely to be Rs. 6,42,40,000 and on the second Rs. 4,19,00,000, a very large difference, due, as explained in Appendix 6, to the low duty of the autumn crop supply. We may now turn to the probable income from irrigation works ; in State ment K the probable produce of these Probable income from irrigation works. ^ ^ ^ ^ obtain when wheat sells at I Seistan man a kran, about Rs. ri4 per Indian maund. It is probable that if railway and canal works were constructed that the average rates would not differ much from these. In years of scarcity we know that there is an unlimited demand from the surrounding districts for all the produce of Seistan, and no railway is needed in such years ; in years of moderate or normal productiveness in these parts of Asia the railway would be most useful in keeping up prices, whilst in years of very great productiveness it is doubtful if there would be sufficient demand from the seaports to enable the railway to keep up the prices, for a study of the information in Chapter XLIX of the “ Revenue Report and Notes ” will shew that the prosperous years in this part of Asia correspond very closely with those in the grain-growing tracts of Northern India, because both depend on the goodness of the rains that come from the Persian Gulf in the winter and spring. The railway is likely to do badly in years of plenty as well as in years of scarcity unless branch lines are96 [Chap. XIV. followed by the caravans that now carry the grain thrown out along the routes out of Seistan. . . Fvfn though Seistdn may have to meet some competition from Northern E\en thou * y oi t plenty, yet there is every reason to hink that “the rates taken in Stafement K are likely to obtain on the average of years and that they are safe ; we may therefore proceed to notice that i„ Sefsln the cultivator^ contribute their tTe firsf 3 ^ ''J to the information in the fourth column of the statement on tirst page of Append X 6 got from the Punjab canals, this should be worth about one rupee an acre this fum may be added to the average annual government share from ah the crops grown on the canals, because it forms part oi the tax which the cultivators pay ; in the expressive language born of their generations of experience it is lhami.

So that the Govern- ment share from the produce of the canals snould be Rs. 71 per acre; whereas that obtained from the Punjab canals from both land and water rates varies from Rs to Rs. 6 39 per acre—We last page of Appendix 6 of this Report and the linage of Chapter XVI of the ‘‘ Revenue Report and Note,' The average annual gross income from the irrigation of the canals on 1,000,000 acres at Rs. yi an acre will be Rs. 71,00,000. £ . ...

The rate may, however, be under-estimated for the reasons given on the first page of Appendix 6 , but it will be evident that the works will be even more pro fitable than those on the Punjab canals if the same skill and foresight is brought to the development of this valuable irrigation property. Before concluding this Chapter it may be noticed that in the footnote on the last page of Chapter XVI of the The expenses of administering the country. &lt;( Revenue Report and NoteS » j t j S shewn that the budget provision for the cost of the Government of the country is about eight annas per acre of cultivation when grain is selling at two Seistani waw a ; whereas the actual cost of the present administration is about one rupee twelve annas an acre when wheat is one Seistani man a kran, but it is evident from a study of the “ Revenue Report and Notes” that the allowances given are unnecessarily extravagant and the administration of the country is not likely to cost more than one rupee an acre when irrigation works are fully developed. It will be realised from the comparison made in this Chapter and in its n , ,. , Appendix 6 between the Helmand delta irrigation and that on the Punjab canals what high revenue resources a country has that is cultivated on the communal sys tem. It is beyond the scope of this Report to follow this train of thought further; it is a subject that merits the interest of the administrator as well as the social philosopher. It is hoped that both will find all the information they require in the “ Revenue Report and Notes.” Neither is it necessary to discuss further those taxable resources of the country that are not derived from cultivation. Those which are more directly connected with the irrigation problems like the tax on cattle-owners and wild fowlers will be affected by the nature of the works; this has been explained in Chapter XV on the drainage schemes, while those that depend on the prosperity of the country like customs, shop tax and judicial fees may, suitably, be thought out by the administrator.9 8 CHAPTER XV.

In Statements A to F very complete calculations have been made of the Statements A to F. inflow and outflow from the inundated area, which not only check the estimates of the volumes poured in from the river, but also those for the capacity of the inundated area made from our surveys and levels. Each of these sets of calculations will be now briefly described ; from this description and a study of the Tables in the Statements it is hoped that a clear idea will be got of the nature of the drainage problem presented by the inun dated area of the Seistan basin. Each Table is accompanied by detail notes which, it is hoped, will make the calculations evident and easy to follow. The areas of the different portions of the inundated lands, given in the Tables of Statement B, were obtained by planimeter from our map i\o. LV on a scale of 4 rniles to an inch : this map has been reduced from our traverse and » vide plans Nos. xiv to xlii. plane-table work, which was plotted on •» Vide pians Nos. lii to LV. maps to a scale of 2 inches 1 to a mile for all surveys made before December 1904, and to a scale of one inch 2 to the mile for all work done after that date. The planimeter work was very carefully done by Lala Thakur Dass, Super visor, who has also great skill in calculating and in contriving tables to exhibit the calculations to the best advantage ; without his assistance this elaborate piece of work could not have been done in the time. The stages or level of the water in the Hamuns at different periods given in Table 1 of Statement B were obtained by spirit levelling and are exhibited on the level sections run —vide sheet Nos. X to XIII. The depths of water thus obtained multiplied into the areas got by plani- meter give the volume or capacity. A cubic foot and a cusec are such small units by which to calculate such great quantities that the sixteen square mile has been used for the unit of area and the sixteen square mile foot as the unit of volume. This is explained in the note under the list of contents of Statement B. Volumes of Helmand River. Statement A contains the information of the volume of the Helmand River obtained during our stay in Seistan ; these Tables have been explained in the opening paragraphs of Chapter X: they give the volume poured into the Hamuns by the Helmand in 1903, 1904, 1905. In Statement C, Tables 2 and 3, we have deduced the volumes poured in by „ . t . the other rivers from the known volumes Volumes of the rivers. f . Tx , i • t' • i of the Helmand River. Iwo guides are available to indicate what proportion the volumes of the other rivers bear to that of the Helmand. The first is the Catchment Area (Table 2) and the second is the Maximum Flood in each year under investigation (Table 3). The Catchment Area would seem the better guide, but our knowledge of the distribution of the rainfall over the very wide area drained by these streams and their tributaries is meagre : moreover, the area of bare desert plain in each catchment varies, and we do not know how much of these deserts drain into the river and how much is absorbed in local hollows. In any case the rains are not evenly distributed in each year, as has been noticed in Chapter V on Rainfall, where the volumes of the floods of the Helmand in different years have been noticed not to coincide with the intensity of the rainfall at Quetta for the year in question. The discharge at Maximum Flood should indicate very closely the relative volume of water that came off each catchment ; but although our knowledge of the floods of the Helmand are very complete and very accurate, being tested by many measurements which agree with remarkable closeness, yet we were not able to get high enough up the Kh£sh, Far£h and Harud Rivers to make measure ments for maximum flood volumes ourselves, and we have to rely on the measure ments made by Baluchis, who were specially trained for this purpose. As already explained on the last page of Chapter VIII, we were able to make measurementsIOO [Chap. XV. on the Fardh Rud ourselves, but these measurements had to be taken below the sp i|| ( Rnrl-i-Randuki luwain (vide fast page or Appendix es or the Revenue Report and' Notes '^and we have no trustworthy .nformatron as to the volume that escaped down that old bed to the Puzak Hamu .

This is not a great difference, cons.dermg t e Lreat difficult; of the problem we have to tackle. In 1903 the volume of the Khdsh Farah and Hardd was 0-64 of the volume of the Helmand by proportion of catchment areas and 07s by proportion of discharge at maximum flood.

In Tables 7, 8 and 9 the volumes in the floods of 1904, 1903 and 1885 are calculated; but it must be borne in mind that water did not simultaneously stand at full flood mark in all three basins, but was in transit from one to the other, rising to the flood mark of the lower basin after the upper basin had fallen* from its flood mark. Nor does the volume got from the areas of the basins and level of the flood marks represent all the water that flowed in, because a considerable amount was evaporated during the period of filling. All this will be taken into account in working out the accounts of each year in State* ments C, D and E. If, however, we ignore the fact that water is in transit from basin to basin, we have the following information of the area covered by water and the average depth thereof : ■ — Table of Statement B» Year.

L, 1,6047; (ii) up to the 15th June when the Hamun-i-Sabari was separated from the Hamdn-i- Puzak. _ Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5 are supplementary to Table 1 and exhibit the calculations for the volume poured into the basin by the rivers other than the Helmand by the two methods already explained. In Table 6 use is made of the information collected, viz.&gt; volume poured Thedataused. * n ’ ca P ac ^y of Hamun and depth of water evaporated to work out in figures what occurred in the inundated area during the flood of 1903. The notes in Table 6 a to these calculations give all the information required to follow the figures. The assumption as to dates at which the different stages were reached are based on information collected in 1903 by enquiries on the spot, d he assump tions about volumes used in irrigation, and the direction from which the different basins were fed, are based on the knowledge of the country that we acquired when investigating the phenomena recorded in these notes. The water poured in is dissipated by evaporation, which has been calculated according to the table given on the fourth page of Appendix 3 of this Report, and by the outflow through the Sar-i-Shela. Doubtless there were also losses by absorption, but these must have been small, as the waters did not spread much further than they usually do in years of good flood and were therefore received on a dry lake bottom that was soon staunched. The result is given in the footnote of Table 6 and shews that there is a discrepancy equivalent to a volume of water The results of the calculations. ^ . l * . . . , sumcient to cover the whole area under flood to a depth of 175 feet, or to 3,000 cusecs flowing for all the year. It is not possible to say definitely whether this discrepancy is due to (i) over-measure ment of the basin of the inundated area due to insufficiency of levels from which to calculate its volume with absolute certainty, or (ii) to under-estimate of the inflow of the rivers other than the Helmand due to want of continuous record of their discharge, or (iii) to an over-estimate of the rate of evaporation. But it is interesting Inference on rate of evaporation. and the Gaud-i-Zireh to note that in Chapter VI it is shewn that there is good reason to believe that the evapo ration from the pools in the Sar-i-Shela is not so much as that obtained from the isolated Jai Surkh Nawar, and the comparatively isolated chung in the Hamun-fiPuzak. It will be seen in following out the calculations for 1904 and 1885 that if we assume that the capacity of the basin and the inflow has been correctly calcu lated the reduction in the rate of evaporation on the broad open sheets of water of the Hamiin comes to about one-fourth less than that given in Appendix 3. In Tables 8 and 9 the Tables 8 and 9, Statement C. are re-arranged in calculations for the year 1903 another form to give figures that coincide with the different stages of the Hamiin, viz.— {\) 15th May on the rising flood ; (ii) 15th June to full flood ; (iii) 15th July end of full flood period; (iv) 15th August subsiding flood; (v) to end of December the time of minimum water in the Hamiin and the advent of the next year’s flow of water. Table 7 is supplementary to Table 8 to get data required therein. In the result the calculations practically agree with those in Table 6 and the same result is arrived at, viz., that the rate of evaporation should be 07 of that in Appendix 3.

Table S shews that a rate of evaporation one-half that obtained for the jai Surkh Nawar does not lead to any more satisfactory results. So Table 6 is calculated for different rates of evaporation on the Upper and Lower Hamuns at the R^h-i-Gardowak. Different rates of evaporation assumed. r^ e was one 0 f exceptionally high hot wind and only moderate floods, and the rates of evaporation are likely to have been abnormal. It would seem that a rate of evaporation of only 0-35 of that obtained on the Jai Surkh Nawar best suits the upper waters, while a rate of n suits the lower waters. The mean of these two rates is o 73* that of the rate oh* tained in Appendix 3 &gt; much the same result as has been obtained for the year icin'!. It is quite conceivable that the rates of evaporation above and below the Rah-i-Gardovvak are very different, as the Remarks on evaporation. upper waters are deeper and more sheltered by reeds, while the lower waters are open and shallow and are being constantly driven to and fro over the arid plains to leeward by the high wind. At the same time we must remember that the reeds probably evaporate a large volume of water themselves, and that much of the wind that reaches the Lower Hamiin has been made moist by passing over the Upper Hamun : per contra we may also recollect that the wind drives the water of the Upper Hamun across the Rah-i- Gardowak, and this has the same effect as a lower rate of evaporation, as it causes a transfer of water from the upper to the lower basin, which our figures are not framed to catch for want of the needed data. It will be observed from the calculations in Statements C and D that if we knew the overflow over the Rah-i-Gardowak, we could calculate the evaporation and absorption losses on both Hamuns ; but this overflow is very complicated, as the level of the water at the ridge of the Rah-i-Gardowak depends on the velocity of the wind. If we knew the losses on either Hamun, we could calculate the overflow : careful observation on the inflow of all the rivers compared with the levels of the Hamuns at different stages would give all the data. Since in schemes of drainage and protection embankments and flood The great flood of ,885. escapes, it is necessary to provide for the greatest volume of water that may ever have to be dealt with, great pains were taken to collect complete information about the extraordinary flood of the year 1885. Statement E the information thus collected is put to the test of figures; the main facts are set forth in the Note alpha to Table 1. In Table 2 the volumes discharged by all the rivers in April 1885 are calculated in great detail: this is necessary because the flood rose suddenly to a discharge at high flood ten times that of the flood of 1903. In Table 3 the volume that escaped down the Riid-i-Taraku is estimated in detail. In Table 4 the volume poured into the Hamun by all the rivers for each month from January to September 1885 is given. Table 5 is a discharge statement for the Sar-i-Shela compiled from the information collected; in Table 7 ^ ese volumes are compared with those got by calculating the overflow of the Hamuns in column 10 of Table i; the volumes agree much better than could be expected. Table 6 is a statement of the inflow to the Gaud-i-Zireh and the effect there on of the loss of water by evaporation. In Table i^the volumes poured in and lost by evaporation are calculated montli by month from January to September; these calculations shew that if the rate of evaporation given in Appendix 3 is taken, the Hamun would have been nearly dry on the ist of January 1886, but Mr. Merk was at Labi Bahring on that day and collected information which proves conclusively that there was as much water in the Hdmun as at the height of the flood of 1903. So Table 10Chap. XV.] 103 h a s been wjrkcd oaf, with a rate of absorption one-half that obtained on the Tai Surkh Nawar and a rate of overflow mto the Gaud-i-Zireh, the same as that in column 10 of table 1. In the result at the end of September there was a volume of 700 sixteen square mile feet in the Hamlins north of the Sar-i-Shela • this is perhaps less than the actual volume on that data but not very much less.’ In Table 6 the account of the Gaud-i-Zireh is made by taking the figures of column 10 of Table I or la and calculating the loss from evaporation at the rates given m Appendix 3 1 he account shews that over and above this loss from evaporation about 6 feet depth was lost by absorption in the sand-hills and parched dry lands over which the water suddenly spread j these lands had been dry for many decades and no^ doubt absorbed a great deal of water. This series of calculations tally with the information collected much more closely than could have been expected, seeing that the floods occurred nearly twenty years before our visit, but many of the Seistanis have great observation and a powerful memory so that by travelling to the spot with the men who saw the flood much valuable and very accurate information could be recovered. Mr. Merk’s observation too confirmed and fixed most important stages of the flood. The Gaud-i-Zireh a permanent lake. Since one of the schemes for reclaiming more land for cultivation in the Assumptions made. Seistan basin would be to divert the flood r 1 • 7- u . 17 1 , waters of the Helmand River direct to the Gaud-i-Zireh, Statement F has been compiled to ascertain whether the Gaud-i- Zireh would bold al the water that came to it from the Helmand. The calcula- tions have been made on the assumption that the waters of the Khash, Khuspas and Khar went to the Puzak Hamun and the waters of the Farah, Harud, Bandan and Madar went to the Saban Hamun, while all the water of the Helmand went to the Gaud-i-Zireh basin ; the usual allowances have been made for water con sumed in the irrigation of the Helmand delta. The rate of evaporation has been taken at one-half that of the Jai Surkh Nawdr, because the rate on the Gaud-i-Zu-eh is likely to be much less than that obtained from that tank, and all through the calculations reason has been found to think that the rate found thereon was greater than in the Hamun. Tables 1 to 5 of Statement F are details of the different years based on the information given in conveniently for the calculations in Tables 6 to 10. volumes of the rivers for Statement A arranged In Table 6 the stages of the Hamiin-i-Puzak are worked out for the years from 1884 to 1891 ; it would appear from the figures in column 12 that in years of good flood this Hamun would overflow to the west, while in most years there would be water in the deep part. In Table 7 similar calculations are made for the Hamun-i-Sabari that shew— vxde column 13 that in years of great flood there would be a considerable over flow into the Hamun-i-Kuh-i-Khwaja. In Table 8 the estimate for the Gaud-i-Zireh is made ; from this it would appear that a permanent lake, about 35 feet deep, would have been formed by 1903, supposing the Gaud-i-Zireh had been dry at the end of 1884 when the great flood came. Therefore Table 10 has been formed starting with the assumption that this permanent lake existed in 1884. When the level of the water in the Gaud-i-Zireh rises above R. L. 1,597 the lake overflows into the Kuh-i-Khwaja Hamun ; from an inspection of column 7 this only occurs after a very great flood like that of 1885; and even in such a year the level of the inundated area north of the Sar-i-Shela only rises to R. L. 1,603, or about that of the flood of 1903, whereas in 1885 we know that it rose to R. L. At the end of a series of dry years, like 1902, the depth of water would be about forty feet, while in years of flood, like 1895 or 1896, it would be fifty-five or up to the 1,588 contour. The Upper Hamuns would also seldom be dry ; the Tables show that they would never actually dry, but in a year of strong hot wind, like that of 1904, these shallow waters would be sure to become dry, as the higher rate of evaporation would then take effect.104 [Chap.

Where the lake was when the glacis formed, is a problem for thegeolog.st or physic,st. Since he Gaud-i-Zireh lalS had a depth, some 20 feet greater than thelake made m ,885, should be possible to trace the ancient beaches on the south and east shore; a part seldom, if ever, visited, but easy of access from the K.rtaka or Cha Muhammad Raza Rest-houses on the trade route. A study of these ancient lakes and their beaches should lead to direct evidence whe her it _,s a act that in the early ac*es of man’s history in these Eastern Countries the rain a was more than it is now. With these speculations these notes have no direct concern; the rate of progressive desiccation is certainly so extremely low that the commercial value of the Helmand River as an irrigation proposition is not affected thereby. For information on this point see the Chapter on Climate and History at the end of the volume of Explorations in Turkistan with an account of ^ the basin of Eastern Persia and Seistan* by Ellesworthy Huntington who visited Seistan in January 1904. The account is too long to be abstracted here. Mr, Huntington was misled about many things for want of the information we have collected; but it would take too long to do justice to his study^ here. A perusal of pages 272 and 273 Sir Henry Rawlinson s Note on Seistan in the Royal Geographical Society’s journal for 1873 shews that he saw reason to believe that 1,000 years before Darius the waters of the Helmand were so small that they could all be used up by the ancient Arian Colonists, and there was no lake ; while in the time of Darius there was a lake as at present. See also the extracts at the end of the articles ; the descriptions of Seistan given by the Arab writers reveal a country such as we saw. Sir Henry Rawlinson’s article is a marvellous exhibition of correct reasoning and should be read and studied carefully by any one wishing to understand Seistan, either from an irrigation or an administrative point of view.

L. 1,592 and R. L. 1,600 is not great, yet the length of channel to be cut is very long : the length off cutting at the Rah-i- Gardowak from the Hamun-i Sabari to the Hamun-i-Kuh-i-Khwaja is sixteen miles and the length to be cut from the Kuh-i-Khwaja to Sar-i-Shela is also about sixteen miles. So that it is obvious that drains could not be profitably dug below R. L. i, 59 2 * n that part of the inundated area that lies between the Hamun-i-Sabari and the head of the Sar-i-Shela ; this depth would be ample, because at this level water would only be left in the deep pools; the Naizar would all be dry. * Published by Carnegie Institute of Washington.Chap.

But the slope in the drain could only be that obtained by the fall of water surface, and so soon as the Kuh*i-Khwaja Hamun became blocked with water a slope of more than one in ten thousand could not be hoped for. In Table 3 the effect of closing off all the Naizar by protection embank- Effect of a drain, ,,ooo feet wide, Table 3. ^ . the fi ° ods &gt;y a dram, 1,000 feet wide, is shewn ; it will be seen that in the middle of May at the height of the flood of 1,903 the water north of the Rah-i-Gardowak would have risen to R. L. 1,602*6 instead of R. L. 1,603*2. This drain would be sufficient in all years except times of extraordinary flood like 1885. But when we turn to Table 4 we see that such a drain would require excava- Quantity of earthwork in the drain. tion of ^'34 lakhs of Cubic feet of earth- work. The soil in the Hamun area is the intensely hard sirr or consolidated alluvial described in Appendix 11 which would cost about rupees twenty-five per thousand to excavate, because the lead to carry the material to spoil would also be great. It will, therefore, be seen that the drainage of these areas is likely to be costly, because the slope of the inundated area towards the Sar-i-Shela is so small that very wide drains are needed and the soil in which they must be cut is very tough and tenacious. With the drain suitable protection embankments are required. These r , x , , , . , embankments should start from the left Protection embankments required. . . r .

The embankment would start again on the west shore of the Rud-i-Parian and follow the main line of flow to the Sabari Hamun shewn in Section No. X. On the shores of the Sabari Hamun at Aukan-i-Shib the embankment would turn south and keep on the high ridge on the left or east bank of the line of flow from the Sabari to the Kuh-i-Khwaja, and would end on the high land opposite the Kuh-i-Khwaja. This embankment would be 100 miles long and would need to be about 10 feet high and 30 feet wide and have many masonry works for flood escapes and regulators in it. The embankment would contain about 200 lakhs of comparatively cheap earthwork, because the bank would be made from loose friable surface soil. So that the cost of the embankments is likely to be a small item compared to the cost of the drain. It might be possible to cause the drain to scour out a wide channel for itself by starting a leading cut only some 200 feet wide at one-fifth of the cost of a i,ooo-foot wide cut. Difficulties to be over come in devising a drainage scheme. The drain would need to be very carefully aligned to catch the current that sets in high wind from the Hamun-i- Location of the drain. g towards the Hamfin-i-Kuh-i-Khwaja. f this were not done, the material carried by the water would be thrown down in he drain and close it.

It is quite certain that the weeds that attract wild fowl would not grow in these pools, because they require quite fresh water free from silt. A Naizar would doubt- less sprint up on the low lands on the margins of the Gaud-i-Zireh; the surplus waters drained by the Sar-i-Shela could be spread over these lands to ensure this, but the area would be insufficient to support the large number of wild fowlers and graziers that now exist. Most of these families must be settled as agriculturists on the lands that are reclaimed j the Saiyads would probably welcome the change as their life is a hard one ; but the graziers,are nearly all prosperous agriculturists, who have escaped from the worries brought by the revenue official to the life of ease and independence with their cattle hidden in the dense reeds of these marshes. It would be possible by masonry regulators to so control the flood as to inun date certain areas reserved as Naizar. The reed will grow if watered daring the flood season only, so that there should be no difficulty in keeping up some Naizar for a limited number of cattle ; but there would probably be great difficulty in maintaining good feeding waters for fish and wild fowl. The pools would be so shallow that they would be certain to dry up in unfavourable years ; and as has been already said, and as will be realized from a perusal of Appendix 22 of the “Revenue Report and Notes,” the weeds that wild fowl love will only grow in pools that have certain distinct advantages. Another difficulty that must be faced in a drainage scheme is the silt that is brought in with the flood waters. At pre- The disposal of the silt. sent this silt deposits on the margins of the deep basins in the Naizar, but if protection embankments were made and the flood waters controlled and sent forward to the deep basins, the silt would be deposited forming deltas therein. The slope from the present mouth of the river to the deep basins through the Naizar is poor, because the waters spread wide and drop their silt. There would be a marked tendency for the river-bed to rise on the silt deposited on the way to the basins, and become much higher than it was before the works of control were constructed. The best solution from this difficulty that presents itself is to pass the high „ „, , . , , silt laden floods direct to the Gaud-i-Zireh. Possible solutions for the silt difficulty. yery far below the river level at Bandar-i-Kamal Khan and an exceeding long time would elapse before the silt deposited would so raise the escape as to give trouble. A similar flood escape might also be arranged to the Sar-o-tar tract, but the objection to this escape is that a limited volume only could be sent in that direction, for the surplus would flow out over the lands about Ziarat Amiran, which would have been reclaimed. The deep depressions in the Northern Hamun would be admirable dumping grounds for silt if the depth of cutting through which the feed channels must pass were not so great.107 Chap. XV.] Silt laden water might be sent into the chung that lie outside the area of Possibilities of basin irrigation. Naizdr that is reclaimed, and a sort of basin , , irrigation done. The floods unlike those of Egypt do not come at a favourable time ; the silt would usually be deposited too late to grow anything but j us ^ as is the case of m / s/n Und ^ mde page j 8 of Chapter II of the 1 Revenue Report and Notes”. The floods come too early to admit of wheat or barley being harvested from these lands But under control the flood waters might be admitted in alternate years to the basins After the clear water was drained off mash could be grown followed in the autumn by wheat and bailey: an autumn crop could even be grown in the next year; instead of leaving the basin idle to the next flood season in March or April. If the levels did not admit of the basin being drained mask could not be orown but the evaporation would dry the basin in time to sow wheat and barley. It would be possible in some years to drain favourably situated basins early enough to grow cotton, maize and millet ; but since the chung could seldom be drained to the Hdmun till the water therefrom had been evaporated, the crops could only be sown in years of low flood when there would not be water to mature them. If basin irrigation of this sort proved to be feasible, there must be scope for making such basins in the broken up tract of the Taraku delta, such as surround the Surdaghal and other similar broken grounds. The Surdaghal could be used as the ultimate receptacle for the water. The Sar-o-tar tract, too, should afford some excellent sites for basins ; from their situation they should be as easily filled from the river as drained to the Hamiin-i-Puzak. A great objection to spreading water about the country is the fear of adding The Seistani fly. to }- he l numbers of the gadfly that make Seistan so unhealthy for horses and camels, and so uncomfortable to men ; and one of the main objects in draining theNaizar would be to rid the country of this pest. But from the life history of this insect given in Appendix 17 of Chapter XLII of the “ Revenue Report and Notes ” it seems doubtful whether the mere destruction of the Naizar would destroy this pest. A very careful study of the insect and the disease should precede any action that would remove the means of livelihood of the Saiyad and Maldar. It will be seen that the drainage of the inundated area, as it is at present, is an expensive work surrounded by many difficulties, and would probably be best arranged for by a complete remodelling of the system by which the Helmand disperses itself into its terminal basin. The studies presented in these reports can only indicate the direction in s , , which information should be collected. The inundated area should be traversed* with a spirit level at close intervals, so as to obtain an exact relief or contoured map of all its features ; this information will enable control work to be designed with precision. The discharges of the other rivers should, if possible, be gauged throughout their period of flow for two or three seasons. Surveys of the ridges on which the main roads cross the Naizdr. The ridges across the Naizar described in Chapter III that divide the basins, and on which the roads cross the Naizar, have all been carefully levelled and surveyed Tracings from the maps, on a scale of one inch to the mile, numbered LIII to LV,f have been made over to Major C. Wanliss, Assistant Deputy Quarter Master General, who has kindly undertaken to reproduce them in the Intelligence Branch. These tracings are shewn among the special project plans on the last pages of Appendix 16 of this Report. Each tracing is accom panied by a longitudinal section of the road. All this information was collected, because it is needed for designing a drainage scheme ; but it will also serve for considering a road or a railway project. It should be possible to make a cheap causeway along the Persian Telegraph Line with stone from the Kuh-i-Khwaja, , such that loaded camels could cross in all except years of very extraordinary flood. Causeways are even more feasible.on the crossing of the Shela-i-Mesh Kushi on the road to Herat, and of the Sar-i-Shela on the road to Kirman. The information on these plans and sections with that in this Chapter will be all that the Railway or Road Engineer will need to design his works. * It is possible to do this in almost all years from October to March. The Hamuns can be sounded from boats. A small motor launch would be more useful than a boat as it would travel in the direct line of soundings. f Plans and sections of the Rah*i*Chashmaka and Rah-i*Tishakani {vide Appendix 28 of the “Revenue Report and Notes”) were also made over.lop CHAPTER XVI. Schemes for utilising some deep and large depression to the west of Kuhak either as reservoirs for water run to escape, or to impound water to be subsequently used for irrigation. To the west of Kuhak are some very deep depressions situated in the high Description of the depressions. plateau OT dfiskt. ^ One of these deprCS- . sions, the Chah-i-Nfma, has been used to take flood waters in the past-—/Appendix 14 of the “Revenue Report and Notes, while the Jai Surkh Naw&amp;r is situated on the banks of the Riid-i- Seistan opposite old Khwaja Ahmed village, and was filled through a breach in the plateau in the flood of 1903. 1 he remaining depressions are land locked and could only be used by excavating very deep trenches to connect them to the Chdh-i-Nima depression or to the river; there are many of these land-locked depressions in the vicinity, but the largest and deepest are the Gaud-i-Namiki, Ch&amp;h-i-Nima Shib on the Persian side and Gaz-i-Jai Ndwdr on the Afghdn side of the boundary. Up to 1891^ the Rud-i-Seistan flowed close to the north entrance of the Ch£h-i-Nima Bald, but after that flood the people diverted the river to some distance from the mouth of the depression. This was done because, when a breach occurred, not only did the flood waters destroy the large area (about 500 acres) of crops growing on the bed of the depression, but water could not be passed on down the Rudd-Seistdn until the depression had been filled, and the current had slackened sufficiently to enable the breach to be closed; this took a long time and the crops on the Rud-bSeistdn suffered. The lake in the Chdh-i-Nima depression finally dried up about 1902 ; as the northern margin appeared above water it was cultivated, and, as described in Appendix 14 of the “Revenue Report and Notes,” irrigation has now been extended to the whole area of the bed of the depression. The Survey of India has made a careful map of these depressions on a Plans and surveys. scale of one mile to the inch ; lines o f levels have been run across them to shew their depth. This information has been plotted on to a trace of the Survey of India plane-table sheets, and the sheets of sections or profiles No. 7 {/) among the plans in the box have been compiled from the levels to shew how the Jai Surkh Nawdr and Chah-i-Nfma Bala depression have been filled in the past. Two longitudinal sections, No. 7 {h) of the Jai Surkh Nawar and No. 7 (i) of the Chah-i-Nima, have been compiled to shew the relative levels of the river, the depression and the culturable land. Finally, in Statement I of this Report, the capacities of the depressions under different conditions have been worked out. The depressions as reservoirs to receive escapage. We may first examine the convenience of these depressions as reservoirs Their9 . ze to take up surplus flood waters run to escape and then their suitability as impound ing basins for the storing of flood water to be afterwards used for irrigation. The first thing that strikes one about them is their great depth : the flood mark around the cliffs of Chah-i-Nfma Bdld is at R. L. 1,647*30. This is about the level of the flood water of the Rdd-i-Seistan opposite the gap at the northern end, where the water poured in; the bed of the Chah-i-Nima depression is 70 feet below this mark, while that of the Gaud-i-Namalu is about ioc, and that of the Chdh-i-Nfma Shib about 60 fedt deep below the level of the mark. The general level of the plateau in which the depressions are situated is about 60 feet above the level of the mark. If a direct cut were made from the river above Burj-i-Kushk and water run into these depressions, the gap at the north end of the Chdh-i-Nima depression being at the same time closed by a bank, they might be filled to a level of about R. L. 1,667*00, or about 20 feet deeper than the flood mark around the margins of the Chdh-i-Nlma depression. From column 3 of Ta*ble 4 the water surface area of the five depressions is 15 square miles.

A trench, ,00 feet wide at the low level of .,635, would secure this. On these assumptions over three hundred lakhsf of cubic feet of excavation would be required. In Chapter XI and Appendix 12 it has been explained that the alluvial m these plateaux is very tough, hard and tenacious, and is likely to cost Rs. 25 per thousand cubic feet to excavate. So that it would cost about eight lakhs of rupees to make oil tPioco r*n t c It would probably suffice to make unlined tunnels from one depression to the other at suitable places and to force water through the tunnels under a high head to scour them out ; the tunnels would fall in, but the scouring power through such a short length of tunnel should keep the gap made open, and so gradually enlarge it. There are evidences that the Chdh-i-Nfma Bala was once two separate depressions which became connected in some such way. About one mile of tunnel would be required and the greatest section of unlined tunnel that could be safely made would be about 100 square feet:; from Mr. Johns’ Note in Appendix n the rate per 1,000 cubic feet of tunnelling would be five times that of excavation in open cutting, so that the cost of this method of working would be Rs. 62,500 for the tunnel, and after that an annual expenditure on enlarging the tunnels to a breach of the required size for which no estimate can be made ; but even so this seems a cheaper method of making the breaches than cutting them with the aid of pick and powder. It therefore seems that these four big depressions could be connected without unreasonable cost if any advantage could be got thereby. In Table 4 of Statement I the capacity of the Chah-i-Nfma, the Jai Surkh and the three big isolated depressions are The capacity of the depressions to receive compared and the figures are arranged to escapage. shew their value as reservoirs to receive surplus water from escapes. It may be assumed that surplus water may be required to be run off for a whole month, and on the average of years that month will coincide with April. If the reservoirs were all empty when the water began to pour in, 2,851 cusecs, 22 cusecs and 3,130 cusecs could be respectively run into the depressions as mentioned above. This is a total of 6,000 cusecs running fora month—a figure which we will need to refer to again ; we may go on to consider that owing to the great depth of these depressions the loss of volume by evapora tion is comparatively small, and therefore in the next year only the volume to replace the evaporation could be run into the reservoir. In Table 4, column 15, it has been assumed that about 500 cusecs for a month could also be run off for irrigation, including this wastage the volume that could be passed to escape in the next year would only be 2,100 cusecs during a month. This, however, would be ample to protect the tract down the Rud-i-Seistan from flooding as at the height of the flood of I 9 ° 3 &gt; 6,000 cusecs was the maximum volume that went down the Rud-i-Seistan, and this volume only lasted 6 or 8 days when it fell to 4,000 cusecs. The daily average volume for the month of flood being only 3,000 cusecs, it would not be necessary to escape more than 1,500 cusecs of this ; so that the depressions * Cut A should have capacity equal to that of cut B plus that of cut C. tCut A, 166 lakhs. Cut B, 83 lakhs. Cut c 72 lakhs - 321 lakhs. JSoo.ooo cubic feet at Rs. 125 per 1,000 cubic eet.Chap. XVI.] 111 could be made very useful to take up surplus water from an escape from the Rud-i-Seistan. The same calculation shews that the 97 ^ cusecs for one month which the Chah-i-Nima is able to absorb would hardly be sufficient, except that it is not in every year that it is necessary to escape water into the reservoir The great value of a regulator and escape to the Rud-i-Seistan, as it is worked at present, would be to run off the high volume that comes down in small floods which do not breach the bandy but which send larger volumes down the Rud-i- Seistan than are neeaed, or than the canals can conveniently carry off ; as a result a considerable area of crops are damaged by floods. For this purpose in such years as I 9°5 Chah-i-Nima alone would suffice. In some years when the floods were moderate the escape might not be used, while the evaporation would continue to diminish the volume of water left in the reservoir, so that on the next occasion that the escape was needed the reservoir would have greater capacity for receiving escapage. The suitability of the depressions as impounding resewoiys for irrigation. But this leads direct to the great defect of these deep basins as storage reservoirs. Before water could be stored for irrigation the water that had been evaporated below the level from which it could be drawn off must be replaced, and in years when water was most needed for irrigation it might not be possible to do this. Floods come after rain in the winter and the spring; in normal years the water would be run to escape in the reservoir any time from the 10th March to the middle or end of May, though in some years the escape would be of service in January. The water would not be wanted in normal years for irrigation till September when the supply in the river is low, and there is a great demand for water for early sowings of wheat, which yields better sown early than late. In exceptional dry years the water might be used earlier to mature autumn crops in August, but years of such low river in August are usually years of low flood, and it is possible there would be no water stored in the reservoirs in such a year. The levels given in sheet of section 7 {Ji) shew that by taking off a canal _ L ... . ^ u .u • sufficiently below R. L. 1,635 to draw off the water in the Chah-i-Nima depression down to that level, water could be delivered on the culturable lands north of the Mil-i- Kasimabad ; the canal would be about 15 miles long and should be capable of carrying about 500 cusecs, if all the depressions were used, or only 300 if Chah- i-Nima Bala alone was used ; its bed width would be about 40 feet and it would run in about 5 feet of excavation in its deepest part; a short tunnel under the dasht would perhaps be needed at the head, and a syphon would be required under the Rud-i-Seistan. From column 14 of Table 4 it will be seen that if all the depressions were used, 60,000 acres might be watered before sowing. The area to be irrigated and the size of the canal is on the whole very favourable. If the depressions were filled from the gap at the northern end by the Difficulty of working such reservoirs in years of Chah-l-Nima Village, Only about 12 feet of poor flood. water could be stored above the level from which the water could be drawn off, while the evaporation from April to September would consume 8 feet of this, leaving only 4 feet available for irrigation ; this is, as has been said above, enough water to provide 500 cusecs for one month— vide column 15 of Table 4. Before this water could be replaced for the next year 2 feet depth of water evaporated from October to March must be made good, and in years of poor flood when storage is most needed there may be difficulty in obtaining water to do this ; if the water were not replaced in that year, it would have to be in the next year before the depressions could be used as storage reservoirs. If the depressions could be fed from the river somewhere above the Band- i-Seistan. the level of water could be raised The capacity of the reservoirs if filled from the about R.

The rough of^“y of earthwork given in Table 6 shews that even along this line loser, because the depth of excavation is least, varying froin 30 to 46 feet, I 1 a6 lakhs of cubic feet of this expensive earthwork would be required. ' From M, Johns' Note in ^ The alternative of a tunnel under the dasht. brick-lined tunnel of about 60O Square feet in area could be made for Rs. 253 a lineal foot, or 13 J lakhs of rupees a mile; such a tunnel should be able to withstand S feet a second velocity and so carry a dis- charge of about 5,000 cubic feet a second. This from column 8 of 1 able 4, would be enough to fill all the depressions up to R. L. 1,645 (about) in one ™nth, so that it would be ample provision to have so far as filling the depressions goes, though it would not be enough to fully utilise the depressions as flood escapes, for this purpose a channel that would take 15,000 or 20,000 cusecs would be more useful as an escaoe is most useful to carry away the flush of a flood, but never* theless in Seistan the snow floods often last long, and a steady draw of 5,000 cusecs for a month would often be found a great help. This point will be discussed more in detail later on. The tunnel could he made on the shortest line to the depressions ; this is from a point about a mile-and-a-half above the Band-i-Seistarj opposite boundary pillar No. 49 or where a tunnel about two miles long would suffice. This might cost 27 lakhs of rupees—an expenditure that it would be difficult to make remunerative. 1. hough it is quite possible that the work might be made at a less cost, either by having a more economically lined tunnel or by a smaller one or both. The tunnels on the Mushkaf*Bolan were through tilted strata and the lining had to be more massive than would be needed in these strata which are still horizontal in the position that they were originally deposited. In addition to the tunnel a channel would be required to connect the tunnel with the works of regulation ; from the second other worke needed. o{ Chapter X1 \ ! these wou ld be near Kala-i-Gawak. This channel presents no difficulty that can be foreseen, and would not be unduly expensive. It is hardly likely that it would pay to make a weir or regulator at the tunnel head for filling the reservoirs, and it would not be worth while making such a tunnel unless it was connected to permanent head-works where the surplus flood water could be passed into it under complete control. In addition to the works to fill the reservoirs, an embankment would be needed to close the Chah-i-Nima gorge at its northern end. The gap is narrow and this bank would not be difficult or expensive to make. A canal would also be required, this canal, as already said, would need a tunnel at its head through the dasht and a syphon under the Rud-i-Seistan. Neither of these works would be very expensive, though they would be large if the canal was of sufficient capa* city to discharge all the water in one month, as has been assumed in these calculations. The sooner the water is used the less the waste by evaporation, which is considerable even in October and November. Jai Surkh Ndiudr.

We may now consider the use of these depressions as silting basins : at the end of Chapter IX, it has been shewn how necessary it is to dispose of the thick silt laden water that comes down at the height of a flood of rain water in such a wav that it may deposit its silt so as not to raise the beds of distributaries. We may rniagme these depressions connected to an escape through which such water could be poured in ; their great depth and proximity to the main channels of the works described under the first scheme on the first pages of Chapter XIII would make them very useful as silting basins. To get full value from them for this pur pose, it should be made popsible to pour in a very large volume, so as to be able to carry off as much of the thick water as possible during the short time such floods last. As we have already seen, this would be very difficult because the depres sions are surrounded by very high plateaux of exceeding hard material. The cheapest way to get at them is from the north end at the village of Chah-i-Nfma ; this is a very awkward place to reach with an escape channel whose controlling head must be somewhere near Kala-i-Gawak j the channel would be long, expen sive and troublesome to work. It might be possible to break a §ap into the depressions by making an unlined tunnel from the river above the band opposite pillar No, 48 and forcing water through it till a gap was broken down. It is not possible to say whether an expedient of this sort would answer on so long a length till all the details were worked out; it would be very difficult to get up the velocity to scour; the silt in the Helmand water is very finely divided, so the attrition of silt laden water would be less than usual, while the clear water might have little effect on so tough and tenacious a soil. If works could be constructed at reasonable cost to fill the depressions with muddy water, we have seen that canals to make use of the water could also be made. It would take ages to silt up f these deep pits, and when silted up the culturable land gained would repay the cost of the work. Other depressions. There are a large number of similar depressions lying in the high plateaux between Kala-i-Nau and Sabz Kim, the cliff to the south of ’Aliabad. In fact the ’Aliabad bay, or depression, was such a depression at a time that the people now living have heard spoken of. The northern limits of the plateau stretched across from Kala-i-Nau through Kala-i-Kuhna to Dashtak; outlyers of dasht can be traced on this line and it is possible that the boundary was once from Burj-i-Sarband through Kimak (the little cliff) to Dashtak. f It may be objected that it is wrong in principle to rob the water of its silt before using it for irrigation ; an examination of Statement G will shew that during the sowing time of wheat the Helmand water is almost as clear as crystal. The basins could never take up all the silt laden water, but they might be very useful to take very thick water that it is difficult to send down channels without silting them. It might be possible to grade the escapes ■ to the basins, so that they would carry this thick water, S644FD FF N.. /[Chap.

As it is these depressions are in some years cultivated. It would be a waste of valuable agricultural land to put the very richfields of the ’Alldbad depression under water in order to go on with this reclamation on these lines, but we can see from this example what can be done by properly dis- posing of the silt laden water. If therefore works are ever constructed to bring the River Helmand under control the depressions on the ifes/ii described in this chapter may form useful basins to catch silt; during the process they will form handy receptacles for surplus water run to escape ; some of which can be afterwards used for irrigation: in course ofages as the deltas of the escape channel appear above water their lands can be reclaimed and cultivated. There are many large depressions along the Rud-i-Sena and it is possible that these too may be reached by flood Depressions in or near the Rtid-1-Sena. waters sent down that channel. To efiect this the schemes proposed in Chapter XIII would need to be modified, because the head of the Rud-i-Sena is at Dak-i-Dila, 10 miles below Deh Ghulam Haidar; its bed is high and the channel to the north from Deh Ghulam Haidar would need to be graded high to get command of the Rud-i-Sena, just how this could best be arranged would require some thought; in the meantime it is not certain that any useful area of depressions could be reached from the Rud-i-Sena: but our maps and sections indicate that when such schemes are under contemplation, this area should also be examined. * Of course the river may have originally burst in here many centuries ago, but a lake last existed here early in the XIXth century. The beaches are new and fresh and so are the shells on the lands.CHAPTER XVII. CONTENTS. A STUDY OF THE POSSIBILITY OF AN EXPANSION OF IRRIGATION UP THE TROUGH OF THE Helmand.

A study of the possibility of an expansion of irrigation up the trough of the Helmand. Since the prosperity of Seistan depends on the autumn supply of the Helmand river it will be well to devote a chapter to a study of how far this supply is secure and to what extent it is liable to be encroached upon. On page c; of Chapter I it is shewn that all the waters of the tributaries which join the Bel- mand at Kala-i-Bist by the Argandab are consumed in irrigation during the period of low river; the supply of the Helmand is not likely, therefore, to be affected by any developments of irrigation which may occur on these tributaries The invaluable perennial supply is brought by the main stream from the high lands of the Hazdrajat. Major Maitland’s study given in Appendix 2 shews that this supply is not likely to be in any way encroached upon, as the cultivation of the Hazarajdt is independent of artificial irrigation. The demands for irrigation injurious to the interests of Seistan are only likely to come from the lands along the Helmand River ; these lands we know are now in a very back ward state of development, though in former times thriving communities must have lived in the trough of the Helmand, as the extensive, and for these coun tries palatial, ruins shew. To arrive at some idea of the proportion of the culturable area of the valley that is cultivated we may study the figures for the Sanjardni tract. Statement 8 of Afghan Seistan in the “ Revenue Report and Notes ” gives the cultivation now done in this tract, and on page 141 of Appendix 2 of this Report the culturable area will be found ; the figures thus obtained are arranged in the following State ment :— Description. Left bank from Rddbar to Bandar-i-Kamdl Khdn. Acres. Right bank from Ziarat Panja Kash to Deh Ghulam Haidar. Acres. Culturable area ... ... ... ... 90,000 15.000 Area cultivated to spring crop ... ... 2,000 3,800 1 Proportion of culturable area cultivated to spring k i crops. The Sanjarani tract at the time the crops were measured was more highly cultivated than the tract from Deshu to Rudbar, and perhaps nearly as highly cultivated as the tract we saw above Deshu ; we won’t be far wrong if we assume that one-fifth of all the culturable land along the trough of the Helmand from Kala-i-Bist to Bandar-i-Kamal Khan is cultivated to spring crop each year. On page 141 of Appendix 2 the culturable area from Kala-i-Bist to Bandar- i-Kamal Khan is estimated to be 394'85* * square miles, say, about 254,000 acres; of this only half should be cultivated in one year, say, 127,000 acres, whereas only one-fifth is probably cultivated, say, 51,000 acres ; so that the cul tivation may be legitimately expanded by another 76,000 acres. The duty of water in the Sanjarani tract, and by inference all along the Helmand trough, is given in the first four canals of Statement 8 for Afghan Seistan of the “ Revenue Report and Notes it will be sepn that on the volume used during the sowing of the spring crop, which is the factor we are interested in, the duty varies from 42 acres a cusec to 171, and for all the figures Distance Square in miles. miles. • Kala-i-Bist to Kiih-i-Khdn NasTiin ... 84 2 ^ 2 0 Kuh i-Khdn Nashin to Bandar-i-Kamdl Khdn ... *26 I 4 3 °S Total ... aio 394‘85 S644FD Average width in miles. 3 1* 1*9 GGn 8 [Chap. XVII, in columns 6 and 8 for these canals the average is 11° acres. It will thus be seen that if the cultivation along the river is expanded by 76,000 acres, an- other 700 cusecs of the precious low river supply will e consumed. If area of cultivation were thus expanded and no attempt^ made to economise and control water, it is certain that the river would dry up in Seistan during the hot months of low river in most years*. The expenditure of water at this time from Kala-i-Bist to Bandar-i-Kamal Khdn on the estimated area of 51,000 acres of cultivation is probably 500 cusecs. This volume would mature 251,000 acres of spring crop, if the duty could be raised to 5c*o acres a cusec,—a not impossible duty ^ when it is recollected that all the cultivation is on the river bank ; and there is little doubt, but that this duty would be secured from this water if the irrigation along the river was under the same men who had charge of the large works constructed in the delta. At the same time this study shews that large works should not be constructed in the delta unless complete control is obtained over the^ Helmand from Kala- i-Bist downwards, and in the last chapter of this Report it will be shewn that the full advantage of this valuable supply of water and fertile tract of land can only be obtained if control is obtained over the catchment area also. Possibility of a high level perennial canal. We may now consider whether it is feasible to take out a large perennial canal high up the river to cultivate the alluvial lands that form the deserts on either side of the trough. The information about the plains and the trough of the river below the Kuh-i-Khan Nashin is very complete, and is given in the admirable topographical survey of the Mission, and in the sheets of sec tions of the trough described in Appendix 2. The plains slope at much the same gradient as the river, because the depth of the trough on the right t The plains on the left bank are broken up by b an ^t is muCh the Same all along this the Kuh-i-Khan Nashin and by the Garmashki length. This slope may be about four Nala .hat comes from the Chaghai Hills. or five {eet a mi , e . a big cana , require a slope of about one foot a mile or less ; to command the desert or dasht it must gain 250 feet on the river ; this it could do in about 65 or 85 miles. So that by carving out a canal in the right cliff of the Helmand gorge some part of the Dast-i-Margo could be commanded. It might be possible to build a high weir or a dam, and combine a reservoir with a canal, and so reduce the height of 250 feet, and in consequence the length of the canal. Such a canal would be a difficult work to construct, as difficult as any to be discussed in the last chapter of this Report. The highest engineering skill and great command of money would be required to carry it out. Neither the Dasht-i-Margo, nor the alluvial desert on the left bank of the Helmand, are likely to be so suitable for cultivation as the plains of the delta; in fact, it remains to be proved that they are suitable for cultivation, though as explained on page 91 of Chapter XIII there is every reason to think that they are. The above remarks would apply to any part of the river from Kala-i-Bist down- wards; in fact, such a canal must take out somewhere near Kala-i-Bist, or it would not get command of a sufficient length of desert to make it worth while to construct it; and therefore it is probable that the head-works would be placed at some suitable place just below the confluence of the rivers. But from our experience of taking out canals in India at the point where the river leaves the hills and running them out on^ to the ancient alluvial plains of the Indus and Ganges valley, I am led to think that it will be possible to take out such a cana above Kala-i-Bist also ; since the perennial supply comes from the ^azarajat, there would be little lost and might be much gained t by going above a a-i-Bist to get the supply for the canal. So far as I know there is no informa tion aval a e w ich would assist in a detailed discussion of such a scheme ; but it is much the same as that which confronted the early engineers in India; a river de bouching from a mountainous country and traversing large alluvial plains, in a more or less deep valley or trough ; when levels were taken it was found that the water of the river could be led out on to the plains to the great advantage of all. * The figure, „„ page 63 of oclnnection . .he .engt'h uTcUe/ed^SVe fesMtVctaal^^ - « W &gt;'; a big® inland tie is about 65 oi ij Helmaodj^ be possible nal, and sok :anal.

So that the only meam e to the cold weather supply of the Helmand is from the demands of cultivadon along he river banks ,n the trough, where water could certainly be was e 3 ’ l “ h n '“ ch Whether the delta and the trough have ever been under extensive cultivation at the same time. Before leaving this subject we may pause to think what happened in the days when all the large ruins which exist along the Helmand were inhabited the cultivation in those days must have been as extensive as the acreage of land in the trough would permit, yet we have never heard that at any period of history water was deficient in Seistan ; or that its prosperity suffered owing to the demands made on the water up the river. In the delta we know that the ruins were never all inhabited at the same time, but at different times ; when the river rt^ f 00 tn 0 te o° the Iastpageof Cha P ter LI deserted a delta the inhabitants mim-af- of the “Revenue Report and Notes.” f 11 * t-. . “grai f ^ i? 'R r 'a .u • , e df following the water. But in the delta of the rarah Kud there are ruins of an extensive city as big as any in Seistan but now all the water of this river is consumed by the canals in its trough • il ls the same on the Kash Rud, but not so as far as we know on the Hanid ^Riid When Peshdwaran was at the height of its prosperity were the tracts now cultivat ed along the river then desolate, or was there water sufficient for both ? Is it possible that the people migrated from Peshawardn up the river when the river got into its present deep gorge, and it became difficult to lead water out on to the delta ? It is probable that the people would prefer the delta lands to those along the river so long as it was possible to cultivate them. Were the people who lived in the great ruins along the Helmand able to get water for their culti vation without injury to the interests of the cultivators in the delta; or were these ruins inhabited at some period when the river was in an unfavourable position in the delta for making economical canals. It would seem that some of the ruins were, since all the most modern of them from Kala-i-Madar-i-Padshah to Palangi and Chigini are of the same age as the prosperity of Kala-i-Fath ; we know that the main canals during this period took out at Puza-i-Mashi, and it would seem that in those days the greater part of the cultivation on the Hel- mand lie from Kala-i-Madar-i-Padshah along the river to Kala-i-Fath, Palangi, Chigini, Kala-i-Guwak and possibly down to Ziarat Amiran. The tract now watered by the Rud-i-Seistdn was probably in the same state as the Miankangi is now, and the river was perhaps at too low a level to admit of taking out canals lower down the river than Puza-i-Mashi, the site of the head of the present Chaharburjak Canal. We have already seen in Chapter XII that the revenue system in Seistdn is elastic and there is no doubt but that it always has been so, as it is the ancient Arian system almost in its original simplicity—a system per fectly adapted to a people who move about in communities from one fertile tract to another. The extensive ruins up the river may therefore be like those in the delta, the habitations of the people during the period they migrated to that tract. On the other hand, if it can be proved that they are contemporaneous with extensive ruins in the delta, then we must come to the conclusion that there was more water in the cold weather at that period than there is now r ; and that there has been a progressive desiccation of the east ” as some aver. When the great interest, as well as the practicaFimportance of the subject, is realised, there is no doubt but that an earnest effort will be made by the archaeologists to study the ruins and work out their different periods, and explain“ ' nle “ &gt; h '*«““• ■ S S;rsf,Hir,^a*r,^r;^ ~ » 5 yx •a- sssirts tuc “ d K S “.Id ”^,41 » classify them by the epochs of the race, .ho bail, ,h,„.

A study on the feasibility of making impounding reservoirs in the trough of the Helm and River, and of controlling the sudden rain floods by works in the catchment of the river. A study of that part of Chapter I which deals with the trough of the Information on the trough of the Helmand given Helmand River and of the more detai'lprl already in this Report. .information thereon, that is given in An pendix 2, will shew that this trough is admirably suited for the construction of impounding reservoirs ; its width though narrow is sufficient to provide as larcre reservoirs as are likely to be required, while the depth is so great that lakes two hundred feet deep can be made; this is in itself a great asset, because the depth of water evaporated during the hot dry season off a narrow fresh water lake Ivin* athwart the wind in the midst of these burning deserts would not be less than siS or seven feet: the proportionate loss of valuable fluid will of course be less on n deep lake than on a shallow one. n a The measurements of so much of the trough that we surveyed have been given in Appendix 2 of this Report, and a very careful and graphic description'of it will be found in Chapters VI and VII of Dr. Bellew’sbook “ From the Indus to the Tigris.” The Survey of India’s topographical map of the Helmand River prepared on the four miles to the inch scale by the survey party that accompanied the Mission should be before the reader of these descriptions. The cross sections of the Helmand River gorge on Sheets No. XXV, XXV (A), XXV (A), (6), XXV (A), {h) filed among the plans in the box will make the section of the valley clear. On Sheet No. XXV the cliffs at Kala-i-Husainabad, and on Cross Section No. XXVI (A) on the same sheet, the cliffs on the right bank near Gumbad-i-Kawargi are shewn ; the other Cross Sections were either stopped at the foot of the cliffs or at the edge of the flood mark of 1885, except Sheet No. XXIII which shews the right bank cliff near the Aukhur and Pakash just above Puza-i-Mashi, and Sheet No. XXIV which is the section of the cliff on the left bank on the road to the Gaud-i-Zireh at the Oruk spring; as explained on the first page of Appendix 2 both these sections are taken at low necks where the cliffs have been worn down by denudation. The gorge of the Helmand is narrowest at (i) Kala-i-Sabz immediately to Probable best sites for dams. the north^ of the Kuh-i-Khan Nashin ; (ii) at Khwaja Ali ; (in) at the Ziarat of the Dasht-i-Hadira four miles up-stream of Pulalak ; (iv) at the bluffs at the head of the Rudbar Canal 3 miles above Landi Bahraichi; (v) at Kala-i-Karbasak about a mile up-stream of Rudbar; (vi) at Kala-i-Madar-i-Padshah ; (vii) and perhaps the valley at Kala-i-Mir might not be considered unduly wide for a dam considering the advantages the site has from its situation at the head of the delta. Above each of these sites the trough has been cut out into a broad bay, so that the deepest part of the reservoir will also be the broadest. It is possible that the contraction that occurs at the site is due to the fact that the alluvial at this site is harder. But we are not able to say whether this hardness is in the bed or the sides of the trough, but it is probable that it is in both and that one or other of these sites will prove admirably suited for the construction of a reservoir dam. At any or all of these sites a dam might be built to hold back the water to a n ., L ,, ^ f . maximum depth of from 1 qo to 200 feet ueptn, width and length of reservoirs possible. , , . 1 , . r _ 1 y above low river level. I he tall or the valley in the direction of the river is about three feet a mile, so the water of the lake, if one were made, would go back up the river from the dam for some 50 or 70 miles. The following statement gives the areas of the valley above each site; they have been measured from the Mission maps ; the areas are taken a little larger than those given at the third page of Appendix 2, because the water would extend up the124 [Chap.

We see therefore that a lake could be made 60 miles long, 2*5 miles wide (on the average) and about 60 feet deep Probable capacity of reservoirs. ^ ^ avera g e ) . S Uch a lake Would have an area of 150 square miles and hold 9,000 square mile feet (562 sixteen square mile feet) of water. Such a reservoir would be more than sufficient to deal with the whole of the water of the Helmand River in such a year as 1903, for from Table 1 cf Statement C we see that from the beginning of October 1902 to the end of April 1903 the surplus water not used on the land was 5,346 square mile feet (334 sixteen square mile feet) ; while from Table 2 of Statement F we see that the whole of the surplus water of the Helmand during 1903 was 8,88o square mile feet (555 sixteen square mile feet). From these volumes deductions should be made for water that would be lost by evaporation in the lake, in the year this might amount 150 square miles multiplied by 10 feet or 1,500 square mile feet. The water caught by the reservoir from the rainfall has already been measured in the volume of the water that passed the Band-i-Seistdn. It will therefore be seen that a lake or a series of lakes could be made which would conserve the whole of the surplus water of the Helmand River in its valley in such a position that all the water not lost by evaporation could be used to irrigate crops. If this were done the greater part of the Naizar would disappear and with it The broad effect on tbe delta of constructing the means of livelihood of the greater part such reservoirs. 0 f ^0 graziers and wild fowlers ; but such a large area of land in the inundated area would be reclaimed to cultivation that these people could be provided for on that, and the surplus cattle exported and sold.Chap.

From Table 12 of Statement A it will be seen that the supply throughout the autumn crop on an average of years is lO'Syy cusecs. If this supply were stored in a reservoir some six feet or so of depth would be evaporated during the time it was in the reservoir: if the reservoir had an average depth of 60 feet, this would amount to a loss of about 10 per cent., so that we would have about 9 )Ooo cusecs available for irrigation on the average of years. The cal culation would be much more complicated than this, for some water should be provided for the early ^ sowings of spring crop when the supply is deficient ; we may assume without much chance of being wrong that this water would be obtained from the floods in the spring crop season that would be caught in the reservoir. The duty on the autumn crop supply would be low; the reasons are given on page 58 of Chapter X; probably not more than 50 acres a cusec; even this would insure 450,000 acres of crops, all of which roight, if required, be first class, as valuable as the spring crops. In practice the area would contain large areas of melons and millet, because these are so valuable to the people. The area gained is therefore only about 200,000 acres of first class autumn crops ; but this is not all the gain, as the dry years that come in every generation could be passed through much more successfully, and the crops in these years would be heavier and better than they could be without a reservoir. It is in these years that there is such a splendid sale for grain Fom the granary of Seistan to the less fortunate districts of Persia and Afghanistan. S644FO 11126 [Chap.

Muc oca ‘nvestiga- tin and comparative estimating must be done before the best site and the best arrangement could be determined on. . , TT . It is not possible to say what the probable cost of a dam ,n the Helmand ^ trough will be, or whether it will be better The cost of a dam. to m3 ike one dam or more than one. It does not seem probable that the length of the dam will be less than one and a half miles ; it is not possible to say how deep the foundations will have to go to reach solid’undisturbed alluvial not liable to be blown up. The Assuan Dam* is ,i miles long ; full reservoir level of water is about • vide Proceedings, in,.i.»,e, civil Engines 5 o feet above low river leve ; the he.g t Volume CLII, Part n, 1902-03. of the dam from bottom of foundations to parapet is nearly 130 feet; the foundations were taken down in places 60 feet below water surface of the river. The dam cost £ 1,500,000 sterling and holds up 1 ae-q square mile feet of water. It is not possible to use these figures as a guide to the cost of a similar work on the Helmand, the rates of labour in Egypt are quite twice as much as those that are likely to obtain on the Helmand ; the dam is likely to be higher and longer and the volume impounded for the same area of dam rather less ; that is, the best site on the Helmand will probably be less favourable than that for the Assuan Dam, while the rates for work will be less. Silt will give more trouble in a reservoir on the Helmand than on the Nile; The great difficulties to be apprehended from tO begin with the Helmand Water in thick the silt of the Helmand. flood probably holds a greater proportion of silt than the Nile water, for Sir William Willcocks’ remarks on the second page of Appendix 4 of this Report indicate that the Tigris carries a greater proportion of silt at high flood than the Nile, while on the first page of Chapter IX wehave seen that the Helmand floods must be very like those of the Tigris in this respect. To get the full value from the Helmand supply it should be stored at all stages of the flood, whereas at the Assuan Dam it is not necessary to store the water till it is nearly free from silt; the thick water is passed through the sluices. On the Helmand the thick water often comes during the time of slack demand, so that it could not be passed on to the fields. Moreover, as already seen, that is the opportunity we would wish to take to conserve the supply ; if we did so, the silt would settle at the upper end if the flood were not passed through the lake; this could be done if there was not too large a volume of water in the reservoir on the arrival of the flood. If the reservoir had like that on the Nile at Assuan to be kept empty till the thick floods had passed, its value would be very greatly reduced ; it could then only store the surplus water of May and June to be usedf in September and October. For this purpose a comparatively small reservoir would suffice, and it would have only a very small effect on the volume of water to be passed to the inundated area. But there is every reason to hope that the silt accumulations could be kept down so as not to rob the reservoir of any appreciable part of its capacity. t It is worth noticing that there should be no difficulty in making and working a dam designed like t * iat at Assuan to catch the clear floods of snow water and conserve them to mature autumn crops or sow spring crop 1 Such a dam could perhaps be built at Kala-i-Mir and combined with the works for irrigating the delta. » ‘e the head-works would be some distance up-stream of the entrance to the Rud-i-Traku, and the flood esca P e , t \ ut Rud-i-Kuchk would have to be carried through the dasht under Kala-i-Roden. This would be a big work, the arrangement would have advantages that would probably compensate for the extra cost.127 Chap. XVIII] At some seasons of the year the reservoir would be nearly empty; at such seasons the current could be guided to scour out silt ; mechanical assistance could also be given. The greatest difficulty would be from the movements of shingle in the river ; The still greater difficulties from moving the slopes on the Helmand are enormous 5hi ' gle ' ... r , . , , compared with those on the Nile ; the shingle will move forward with the floods ; and, as remarked on page 86 of Chapter XIII, if any serious mistake is made in designing will collect in masses that it will be very difficult to move. If a large reservoir is made these may by judicious handling form a delta at the upper end; it may be possible to catch the shingle in a properly designed upper reservoir, from which water free from shingle would be passed on. A very careful study of the slopes, the velocities and the material of the bed right up to Kala-i-Bist must be made before it is possible to say what can be done. It will be seen that the design of reservoirs in the Helmand trough will All the difficulties traceable to the sudden and ^ive great difficulty due to the Sudden high floods that follow rain. ^ floodSj for not only do these floods bring down thick water, but by their unusual volume causes the shingle to move along the bed to places to which such material does not travel in normal flow. In the last paragraph of Chapter XIII we saw how these same floods added to the diffi culties of the irrigation of the delta and the disposal of flood waters. The ad vantages of reservoirs in the trough are so many that no effort is likely to be spared once the time comes to make them ; the most efficient and the simplest way to control the floods is at the points in the catchment where they arise ; this will be described in the following sub-chapter. Controlling the floods of the Helmand by myriads of dams or weirs to be con structed in the area of its catchment. The control of floods at the points at which they arise in their catchment has reached a high stage of efficiency on Literature and existing experience gained. ^ Rhone . in France . The method Was not unknown to the ancients who formerly inhabited British and Persian Baluch istan; I have seen some notes by Mr. Hughes Buller and Mr. B. A. Gupte, his native assistant, which shew that gnebre walls were built for this purpose. I have not been able to get any literature on the subject; the most up to date experience seems to be in France and I have not yet been able to get any of the books written by French Engineers. On the Rhone the dams were built to control the floods, in Baluchistan to conserve water, in the catchment of the Helmand they w r ould be required for both purposes.

The admirable description of the Hazarajat, given by Colonel Maitland, in Volume IV of the “ Intelligence Branch Records of the Afghan Boundary Commission,” extracted in Appendix 2 of this Report, tends to shew that the catchment areas of the Helmand River and also of the Farah Ru are a mira y suited for this purpose—see the portions in italics on the second and ourt pages of Appendix 2. When each minute tributary has been thoroughly dealt with, em bankments being made at every suitable point to hold back the^ water, tie main tributaries can in turn be dealt with, and the ‘ narrow or tangi a so oc r e , so that flood waters may be effectually held back. The essential principle is to begin at the watershed of each minute tributary, and work down it to its confl, d ence ^ the next, and not to go down any main tributary till all the needed wens 0 dams have been made on the lesser tributarie s. * * A valuable letter on this subject exists in the file of ^ R^afEngffieer, Nar Tangi Reservoir Scheme.

There will still be silt enough to renew the cultivated soil, and being more under control it will be easier to effi. ciently spread it over the land. The onlv place where such works have been attempted in India that I know of are those alluded to in the footnote of the previous page at Fort Munroe; but similar works would no doubt be of immense value m Baluch,stan and along the Frontier generally, but more especially on the tributaries of the Jamna River which has a much larger area at its command than it can protect. It suggests itself to me that the catchment area of the Simla water-supply would be a good area to begin on ; here the work could be easily supervised and directed by the Engineers already employed on these works; the direct gain therefrom could be measured at the pumping station; with this experience for guidance similar works could be inaugurated wherever required in India and its Frontier.

Concluding remarks. ment cannot be considered practical at present, but these methods suggest themselves as the natural solution of some of the difficulties, to be overcome by works of irrigation in Seistan ; they are therefore stated here, so that they may be realised and thought over now. They may seem far-fetched, but so would the works now existing or under construction on the tributaries of the Ganges and Indus have seemed, had they been described by the Subaltern of Royal Engineers who in 1820 was sent to report on the feasibility of re-opening the long since abandoned canal dug by All Martian at the inspiration of the Emperor Shah Jahan for the irrigation of his gardens at Delhi; yet the canal works of the present day are the necessary sequence of that re-opening of the Western Jamna Canal to irrigation. This occur red barely three generations ago; for nearly two of which Government had no settled policy and no specially trained professional staff; during the last generation Government has attained to both, and it is inconceivable that the experience thus acquired will end at the North-West Frontier of India, and not pass into the lands beyond, once the homes of great people the most civilised races of ancient times. It will be evident from the study of the Helmand River that large areas in these countries could be as easily peopled and made prosper ous, as the once waterless bar that now form the Chenab and Jhelum Colonies-- themselves once populous, as the innumerable ancient sites of villages scattered over them testify.appendix I.

The Hazarajat or the country drained by the main stream of the Helmand River and the country drained by the Farah Rud and Harud Rud. I had extracted some notes from General Perrier’s “ Caravan Journeys ” about the mountains in which the Helmand and the other rivers that flow into the Seis- tdn Hamun arise, but I judge from the following remarks by Major Maitland that Perrier has generalised too much for what he says to give a trustworthy impres sion of the country. Marching from Machkandak to DaolatYar on July 3, 1885, Major Maitland says :— The range bounding the south side of the valley is an outer ridge of the Sufed Koh. No distinctive name could be got for it. It must be explained once for all that the names Sufed Koh and Siah Koh, applied by Perrier to the mountain ranges north and south of the Hari Rud valley, existed only in that persons lively imagination ; and it is unfortunate they should have been perpetuat ed on our maps. There is no Siah Koh near the Hari Rud, but the name Safed Koh does belong to a portion of the hills south of the river between Obeh and the Herat valley.” AGAIN DOALAT YAR, 25TH JULY. “The Hari Rud flows in a winding gorge ; of the northern hills separating the Hari Rud valley from the basin of the Upper Murghab, I could make nothing. They are, however, altogether unlike Perrier’s account of them. Far beyond Daolat Yar to the east north-east is the high snowy range here called Band-i- Bakhak, which becomes much lower to the right. The northern hills are totally devoid of snow. There are no trees either on the Band-i-Bayan, or the northern hills. The low hills adjacent to the valley are also without any trees or even bushes, except those of the smallest size. They are, as usual, green with herbage of sorts, though there is very little grass. On the other hand, the valley of the Helmand is here well wooded, though the trees are small, and the view up it, over the confluence of the Shineh (Shinia means Doao) is pleasing.

On the northern side of the Hazdrajat, the Dasin oi together with Bamidn, and Yak Walang to the C0 “fJ R °' y S ZnX peopled’by Hazdras is not in the Hazdrajdt at all. But ill andlir-i-Jangal between Yak Walang and Daolat Yar are in the Hazdrajdt. &lt;• The total length of the Hazarajat, as above defined, is something less than 1 &amp; 200 miles from north-east to south-west, Area and elevation. an( j j ts greatest breadth is about 150 miles. Its area mav be roughly taken at about 18,000 square miles. But the total area of country inhabitated by the Hazdras cannot be less than 30,000 square miles. i&lt; 'pbe average elevation is somewhere about 10,000 feet. There are peaks in it over 13 000 feet. Those of the Koh-i-Babd rise to upwards of 16,000 feet. But the average elevation of permanently inhabitated places may be taken at nltrmt 8 ooo feet. Cl Roughly speaking, the Hazarajdt is the basin of the Upper Helmand. Lai and Sari Jangal, however, which are in. General description of the Hazarajdt. eluded in it are the narrow valleys of the two streams which unite at Daolat Ydr to form the Hari Rud. On the west side the Taimanis come over the watershed, and inhabit some small tracts draining to the Helmand. On the north-east Besud includes Khesh, which drains by the Dara Turkoman to the Ghorband River, and Khawat which ^ drains east to the Logar river. On the South-East Ndwdr is said to be a basin •without drainage outlet, and the Jdghuri country is the basin of the Upper Arghanddb.” “ The general character of the country is very different from those portions of Afghanistan which are best known to us from having been occupied by our troops during the war of 1878 to 1880. In its physical aspect the Hazarajat may be said to hold an intermediate position between the bare, rocky, and forbidding hills of the tribes on our North-West Frontier, and the finely grassed downs which are characteristic of large portions of Badakhshan, Afghan Turkistan, and the northern part of Herat. Taken as a whole, the HazArajdt bears a certain resemblance to the Highlands of Scotland. The mountains are generally covered with soil, and rise in great folds, presenting a decided contrast to the sharp bare ridges of rock, with their wide debris slopes, which prevail in those portions of Afghanistan nearest to India. On many of the Hazdra mountains there is culti vation far up the sides nearly to the summits. The valleys of the streams and livers are generally narrow, and the further the stream is descended, the deeper the valley, and the more frequent the gorges through which it passes. As a rule, the upper valleys and glens are shallower and more open than the lower. No doubt there are many exceptions, but in the course of a long stream its valleys may be expected to contract rather than expand as it is descended. In all the northern—that is to say, the upper—part of the country the valleys, though frequently narrow, are not very deep, and the hills on either side are compara tively low, and generally easy of access. The latter are often well covered with grass in spring and summer. The most difficult, and also one of the highest portions of the Hazarajat, is the Pas-i-Koh. which is understood to be the upper portion of the country held by the independent Hazaras. It lies south of Besud, and immediately west of the Nawar _ basin. The Dai Kundi country is also very mountainous. But no portion of either of these tracts has yet been explored (1889). The Dai Zangi country and Besud are by no means difficult for a hill country. “ The whole Hazarajat is very treeless. The forests, which have occa sionally been heard of, seem to be absolutely non-existent. Even the juni-&lt;hi 133 App. I.] 133 per which is thickly sprinkled over so many hills in most parts of Afghanistan appears to be rare ; It may exist in large quantities in such unexplored regions as the Dai Kundi_ country, and that of the independent Hazaras but it is hardly likely that it should. Over the greater part of the Hazarajat at all events the only trees are small willows by the water-courses and here and there some white poplars. But the latter do not seem to’ be found above 8,000^ feet, and the same altitude seems to be the limit of the fruit trees. Practically there is no fruit at all in the northern portion of the Hazarajat which is somewhat surprising, as in Bamian and Yak Walang, on the north side of the Koh-i-Baba, fruit trees are abundant. In the southern parts of the country the people have orchards. This is notably the case at Ghizao in the Dai Kundi country. “The common fuel of the Hazaras is obtained from the small bushes and low scrub, including wormwood, which grow over the hills, and are known by the general name of buta (bushes). These have large woody roots, and afford toler able firewood, though far inferior to archa (juniper). “The general fertility of the Hazarajat is considerable for so hilly a country. Cultivation. The amount o f irrigated land in the valley . an d glens is not large, but the datmt or unirrigated presents a very considerable total area. Fields may be seen all over the hill sides, and, though seldom or never terraced, the crops are said to do well. “ The higher parts of the country are almost too cold for wheat, but barley is successfully cultivated in most places. An inferior kind of barley called kaljao is largely grown; and on this and various kinds of pulse the Haza ras greatly depend for their food-supply. In the lower and warmer valleys beans, melons, coarse rice, maize and tobacco are raised but in small quantities. “ Sheep are numerous. Usually the brown variety called the poshtzn sheep. Animals ^ There are many small horses. Bullocks are used for ploughing and also as pack animals. Donkeys are common. There are no camels. “ The only wild animal worth mentioning is the wolf. There are oorial } ibex, and deer of various kinds, but as the population is generally diffused, all kinds of game are much hunted. The climate is very severe in winter. This season often commences so early that snow often falls on standing crops, or on the corn collected on the thrashing floors and does damage. The first fall of snow in the Northern Hazarajat is expected about the beginning of October; but this is slight. Heavy falls generally take place in December and the greater part of the country is impassable for several months. “ Snow lies on the ground for five months in the Dai Kundi country and the Pas-i-Koh ; elsewhere for four months. After the melting of the snow in April, there is a month or six weeks of rainy weather when the clay soil, saturated with moisture, renders travelling very difficult and all the streams are in flood. But in summer and autumn, that is, from May or June till the end of Sep tember, the climate is magnificent.” The ’valleys of the Fardh Rud and Harut Rud* The following extracts are made from the account of the Taimanis country at page lyi of Volume IV of the “ Records of the Intelligence Party, Afghan Boundary Commission.” “ Almost the whole of the catchment basin of the Farah Rud appears to be the Ghorat, that part of the laimam Boundarie9 * country which contains the two valleys of the Ghor-i-Taiwara and Ghor-i-Mushkan. * Spelt Harut in the Records, and is so pronounced hy the people in Seistao, though he literate speliing appears, to be Harud.

Jamshedis, Sum, Hazaras of Kala Nao, Feroz Kohis, Taimanis. “ The general elevation of the Taimani country is between 7,000 feet and 5 8 ( ooo feet. Thus Farsi is 7,200, Shaharak Elevation - Fort 8,ooo, and Taiwara probably about 7,000 feet. The highest point of the country is to the north-east at the sources of the Farah Riid, where the elevation is over 9,000 feet. In the extreme south west there is a rapid fall, and the valleys of the Parjuman and Nizgan are well under 5,000 feet. “ The general drainage of the Ghorat is from north-east to south-west, and that of the Northern Taimani country from east to west. But some of the eastern parts of the country drain to the Helmand. “ Looked at from any of the higher elevations in the northern part of the country, the whole region presents the General character. appearance of a sea of brown and bare hills, running in a general east and west direction, and extending ridge behind ridge as far as can be seen. These hills are of no great height as compared to the general level of the country, and are rounded and gravelly rather than steep and rocky. Here and there rises a peak. The most notable of these are the Koh-i-Wala, south-east of Farsi, 12,682 feet, climbed by Merk and Talbot in September 1885, Chalap Dalan, north of Taiwara, 12,693 feet, and the Koh-i* Jam Kala near the south-east corner of the country, which is the highest of all and rises to the respectable height of 13,598 feet. Chalap Dalan is the hill called by the romancist Farrier * one of the highest mountains in the world ’ 1 It is a truncated cone rather than a peak. “ The Taimani hills are totally different from the grassy uplands and tre mendous ravines of the Feroz Kohi’s country, or from the magnificent rolling down pastures of Badghis. They are bare and stony though not often actually rocky. Low scrub of wormwood, etc., and a little coarse grass is their only covering, so that a general view gives an impression of barrenness, and even of desolation, which is not altogether correct. “ A peculiarity of the Taimani country is the abundance of grass that is found along the course of the stream which are numerous and constant. “ There is also a considerable aggregate of cultivable land in the valleys and glens. This is by no means made the most of for various reasons, but if the country remains undisturbed, cultivation may be expected to increase. “The 'valleys even the main valleys are generally narro , w f often only a few hunared yards across which often close into short rocky defiles* The hills bound ing the valleys are frequently mere undulations. “ In the lower valleys the hills on either side are often high and steep. The same peculiarity is found throughout North-Western Afghanistan. ** The whole Taimani country is remarkably destitute of trees and bushes of any kind. Afghanistan is notedly treeless, but this tract is as bare as Bdd- ghis. “ Only along the Fardh Rud is there some natural jungle, but only a thin strip of willows and tamarisk. u The Farah Rud is said to run all the way in a deep narrow valley«-in Farah Riid. * act &gt; a g re at ravine, with frequent gorges. Even as high up as on the road from Tai wara to Khwaja Chist; it is not easy to ford except when at its lowest—in autumn. Twenty-five miles lower dow r n on the Taiwara Farsi road it is almost impassable. “ A few miles lower on the road from Parjuman to Sakhar, it is impractic able for camels, though horses and mules can go over when the water is low# From this point the river flows through mountains.App. i ] “ The crossing on the Parjuman and Sabzwar road, io miles above the June- tion of the Ghor stream is also difficult on account of high banks. It is a laro'e river at this point. At all the fords the depth of the water is said to be 2-i to 'i feet at the season of lowest water. ° “ The Taimani country is a wild upland region, remarkably destitute of wood General. an y f? riT i, but having quite enough fertile land in its narrow valleys to grow suffi cient grain for local requirements. Wheat and barley are raised in the usual proportion of two-thirds of the former and one-third of the latter. The land is partly or mostly irrigated from the streams in the valleys, which afford abundance of water all the vear round. There is also datma cultivation entirely dependent on the considerable snow and rainfall of the winter and spring. Vegetables and -pales^ dhal, lucerne are grown and rice, cotton and tobacco in the warmer localities. Fruit trees are found in some of the lower valleys. “ The luxuriant grass attracts a large number of Afghans from the Pusht-i- Rud district, who swarm in some parts of the country from May till September bringing flocks of sheep and herds of camels. The Taimanis have few sheep and no camels but keep bullocks. “ In winter the climate is severe snow lying to the depth of several feet even Snow&gt; in the valleys. The first fall is expected in November. It is generally off the valleys by the end of March, but still lies on the hills; the higher kotal are not passable till the end of April. At this season the streams are all in flood. Summer and autumn are delightful. Patches of snow remain on the higher hills all the year round. “ The nights begin to be frosty in September, which is the wheat harvest, earlier or later according to elevation and latitude. Sometimes the wheat is not down till October, and, as in Scotland, the harvest is occasionally spoilt by an early fall of snow. 11 Barley is always a fortnight earlier than wheat.The gorge or trough of the Helmand River below Kala-i-Bist, Direction and length of the gorge—Its depth—On the south bank—On the north bank.

The course of the river from Kala-i-Bist to Bandar-i-Kamdl Khan is in the form of a bow ; the Kuh-i-Khan Nashfn hill, being at the bend of the bow and 40 miles south-east of the direct line, or string of the bow, the western bend of the bow is completed at the mouth of the Rdd-i-Parian, near Tappa-i-Kohlak the distance along the string of this bow is 167 miles, along the bow itself 270 miles and the greatest distance between the string and the bow is 80 miles measured between Chaharburjak on the Helmand and ’Ab Khash on the Rdd-i-Khash (map of Afghanistan, 16 miles to the inch). The gorge is deep and narrow; the great depth will be realized by examining Its depth on the south bank. the sections taken on the descent from the .... . . Registan to the Helmand and on the march down the valley; the main features of the descent are plotted as sections on the maps’of the gorge to the quarter inch scale. The section of the Registan above the Kiih-i-Khan Nashin shews that there is a sudden rise of over a ico feet, from the river on to the plain which is rapidly increased to 250 feet, 10 miles back from the river. The rise of 1,300 feet to Saiyad Muhammad Langar, 35 miles from the river, would be still more rapid if the section had not been taken alono - a ndluh bed up which the road climbs to the plateau by a gentle ascent. From Dr. Bellew’s careful and very valuable descriprion of the physical Tide from “ Indus to the Tigris. 1 ' features of the Helmand gorge it is evident . / t that the ascent from the river to the Registan is much the same all the way up the river to Kala-i-Bist. Mr. Johns’ section from Galichah to the Helmand shews a steady rise from the valley of the river near Kuigi above Khwaja ’Ali to the foot of the Chaghai hills; the rise is 2,200 feet in 48 miles, or 46 feet a mile. This section is also in a nalak, hence this gradual ascent, for the section at Khwaja ’Ali, which was made along a road that ascended the scarp more rapidly, shews that the ancient alluvial plain, which is here a plateau cut off from the skirt of the Baluchistan hills by the Gaud-i- Zireh basin, is about 300 feet above the valley of the river, and that the edge of the gorge is a cliff. Between Khwaja ’Ali and Riidbar this ancient alluvial plain is nearly 500 feet above the valley of the river. The cross section (No. XXIV) from Dam-i-Sangar to the bed of the Gaud-i-Zireh at Oruk passes over a low pass, the summit of which is R. L. 2,053, level of the water in the river being R. L. 1,793, the plateaux on either side of the pass being at R. L. 2,078 (on west) and 2,060 (east). The trough of the Helmand is therefore 295 feet deep at this point. , 4 *” Kala-i-Jan Beg, Mr. Johns’ section shews that the plateau of the ancient plain is attained in three steps : the first at 90 feet, the second at 200 feet and the third at 300 feet above the bed of the valley; evidently the scarps of ancient river troughs or lake margins. At Roden the cliff is about 90 feet high, the other two higher plains having receded to the south, as shewn in the topography of the map on the quarter inch scale made by the Mission. The plateau narrow, though it is, has some enclosed basins, the Jausaini and Shirbaz Nawars, which catch the water of the light winter rains and afford a few days of valuable grazing to flock- owners ; the details of the plateaux on either side of this part of the river have been carefully surveyed by the late Khan Bahadur Shaikh Muhi-ud-din and by Rai Bahadur Gopal Singh of the Survey of India, and are of intense interest to Hate map No. Ill—i( a ) on page 205.

The scarp of the Reg.stan, as seen on the descent at Baghak above the Kdh-i-Khan Nashin; seemed to fall in irregular rounded downs rather than in sharp alluvial cliffs, but this was perhaps due to ihe obtrusion of the Kdh-i-Khan Nashin near by to the west; for the plains passed over from Nawab Khan|! Chah to Fakir Band Nawar, where, geologicaly speaking the same ancient alluvial deposits, as those on either side 0 the Helmand below Khwaja ’Ali, more varied and extensive, but nevertheless alluvial terraces of ancient rivers or lakes. From about Mala Khan down to Bandar-i-Kamal Khan both sides of the rroree are cliffs of alluvial. At Bandar-i-Kamal Khan the south side of he norae ends and the cliff turns south forming the eastern_ boundary of the delta fill it reaches the Gaud-i-Zireh, when it returns east forming the northern coast of that cart of the lake basin. The right side of the gorge turns north at Bandar- i-Kamal Khan following the present course of the river and forming the east boundary of the delta as far as Kala-i-Fath ; here it turns east and becomes the boundary cliff of the Dasht-i-Margo, and the lake basin on the_ eastern side right up to the trough of the Khash Riid; the northern termination of the Dasht-i-Margo. The gorce of the Helmand River below the Kuh-i-Khan Nashin, as The deep ravines on th, souih of ih, Hei m and depicted in the splendid topographical maps near Khwaja’AU. of the Survey of India on a scale 01 tour miles to the inch, is worthy of attentive study. _ The details of the trough! or de pression from Jalal Khan Nawar down which the road from Chah Ismailto Khwaia ’Ali descends to the river at Kuigi or new Khwaja ’Ali, and the Robat Nala that tails into the Gaud-i-Zireh have been added to by the sections taken by Mr. Johns. In Section No. 4(A) of the Special Project Plans and Sections, the main features have been plotted to shew that it is impossible that_ the Helmana could ever have entered the Gaud-i-Ztreh down this descent; had it ever done so, it would have remained there till it had silted up the depression and formed a vast delta in it—a -work of countless ages. These sections were taken on the march down the Helmand to make certain that the river had never flowed in this direction, as the gap in the cliff made by the entrance of the depression trom Jalal Khan Nawar is very striking, and so far as the eye could judge might as likely be the outlet of an old distributary as the inlet of a tributary. * * * § *See Cross Section XXV the high dasht or alluvial plateau is at R.

Cross Section No. XXIV shews that the distance from the edge of the water to the face of the cliff that forms the nor thern shore of the Gaud-i-Zireh over the Oruk spring is only 37,400* feet or seven miles while the drop from the water surface R. L. 1,793 of the river to the bed of the Gaud-i-Zireh (R. L. 1,533) is 260 feet. At Oruk a very small quantity of water oozes outf of the cliff of alluvial, the level of the water in the spring being R. L. 1,608, or 185 feet below that of the water of the river. There is another similar spring at a level 52 feet lower and also nearer to the bed of the Gaud-i- Zireh. For details see Plan LI on the scale of one inch to a mile, prepared by Lala Thakur Dass, Supervisor. These springs must be fed by leakage^ from the river and if so, is the only instance we know, where a vein of water exists in this compact apparently impervious alluvial, that so far as we have been able to test is as staunch as the most solid rock.

We owe the survey of this tract to the gallant Khan Bahadur Shaikh Mohi-ud-din; itwas this sheet that his plucky Khalassie cut off the plane- table and rescued, when all else was so tragically lost in the arid super-heated Dasht-i-Margo. Section No. XXIII levelled by Sub-overseer Hari Singh shews that at 22,800 feet from the river as measured along the line, the depression is at as low a level as the river (R.

The view over this depression shews huge mountains of sand blown off the alluvial plains of Seistan and trapped from the bad-o-sad-o-bist ruz, the depression lying in the direct line of this wind as it comes from Seistan. The depression or ravine is a remarkable ono and its formation is difficult to explain. The drop from this part of the river to the lake basin on its right bank is only 173 feet, whereas on the south side it is 260 feet but the contoured J map shews that the Lallu Nawar in the extreme south-eastern corner of the basin is the highest part thereof ; there is a gradual but slow fall all rouna tne toe oi me ncmi&lt;xuu Talus from theLallu through the Puzak and Sabari Hamun, and so on round by the Sar-i-Shela the Gaud-i-Zireh.

From the detailed description given by Dr, Bellew, the gorge in the reach from Kala-i-bist to the Kuh-i-Khan Nashln is much wider than in the reach from Mala Khan to Baudar-i-Kamal-Khdn, and it is estimated that the area of the gorge over this length of 84 miles is 425 square miles, or a mean width of 5 miles. Around the skirt of the Kuh-i-Khdn Nashin from Landi Wala Muhammad Amin to Mala Khdn, along a length of 28 miles, the gorge is about i|- miles wide, or has an area of 35 square miles. It is believed that the gorge is widest at Hazar Juft ; \vhere it may be 10 miles wide as a limit; it is narrower opposite the Khan Nashln Hill, where it is not much more than a mile wide at places ; there are bays above and below Khwaja ’Ali, Pulalak and Rudbar, which are about 3 miles wide, and a general widening out of the valley below Ziarat Panja Kash, near Madar-i-Padshah, to a general width of 3 miles. The general average width from Kala-i-Bist to Bandar-i- Kamal Khan works out to 3*27 miles ; but the figures for the portion of the trough or gorge that has not been measured may be over-estimated. From the measure ments taken from the Kuh-i-Kh 4 n Nashfn downwards the gorge is 2'o miles* wide on an average, and about 250 feet deep. Owing to the gorge or trough of the river being so narrow the river is very straight, and the length of the river measured along the main stream on a map of large scale does not differ much from the bee-line distance within the gorge. As the valley is so narrow', it is evident the area available for cultivation in t J ., . u . . ,, the gorge is also small; this would be still smaller were it not that the river bungs one side or other of its trough, leaving a useful strip of land on the opposite bank. These strips have extensive and very ancient ruins on them shewing that they have existed in their present position for a very very long time without much change and have been highly prized and valuable properties. Starting from Kala-i- Bist the river hungs the Registan, leaving the Zaras tract on the right bank, a populous and well cultivated area which extends along the river for about 30 miles till it pinches out at Shamalan, opposite the village of Hazar Juft, by the river hugging the Dasht-i-Margo. The cultivated plain re-appears on the left bank as the celebrated or tract of the 1,000 ploughs, which continues down the river to the Kuh-i-Khdn Nashfn, and ends against the skirt thereof. ^ The culturable tract now takes the right bank from opposite the Kuh-i- Khan Nashln to Kala-i-Sabz, and is a narrow fertile strip extending about 20 or 35 miles along the river with an almost uniform width of 1 mile. From Kala-i-Sabz to Ziarat Panja Kash near Kala-i-Madar-i-Padsbah, a length of 81 miles, the river hugs the scarp or cliff of the Dasht-i-Margo, and there is no culturable landf on the right bank of the river. From Landi Wala Muhammad to Mala Khan, a length of 28 miles, there is no culturable bottom to the gorge on the left bank of the river either, as it hugs the Khan Nashln Hill ; but from Mala Khan there is a culturable strip on the left bank of the river all the way to Bandar-i-Kamal Khan. From Ziarat Panja Kash to Deh Ghulam Haidar, opposite to Bandar-i-Kamal Khan, there is also a culturable strip along the right bank, narrow but useful. At Rudbar a higher more ancient valley of the gorge appears, Iving between the present culturable valley and the bounding cliffs. At Kala-i- Madar-i-Padshah the river hugs this more ancient plain and continues to do so as Kr as Kaia Jan Beg for 10 miles. This more ancient valley is out of the reach of the present canal system except for the old high lying river bed* between Kala-i-Madar -i-Padshah and Kaikubad down which a ruined canal can Land^ X Bahr t ech P i!° USh ^ lW ° ° naDd br ° U§ht ° nder CUUiVali ° n in 1504 bjr a wate r' c ou™e called Regan opposite high^imonly just'rea^:hed iU° ^ higher th9n th8 FeSent bed * The flood of l8S S which rose 30 » feet above normalApp. 2.] 141 be traced. This higher more ancient plain occupies much of the valley on the left bank as far as Kala Roden where it ends. It is locally called the dasht (plain) in contradistinction to the abadi (cultivation).

Between this culturable strip and the cliffs is a piece of the more ancient higher valley similar in all respects to the dasht on the left bank described above ; this is also too high to be irrigated from the present canals. It has an area of 20 square miles. Below Chahar Burjak this ancient and higher valley or dasht* occupies the valley, which is here wide, except for a former riverf bed down which the tail of the Chahar- burjak Canal goes ; this affords about ij square miles of culturable plain five and half miles long. At the river edge between Kala-i-Mir and Deh Ghulam Haidar is a narrow strip of excellent culturable land 3! miles long and two square miles in area. The total area on the right bank that could be cultivated by the present canals is therefore 45*25 square miles.]; This added to that on the left bank makes i42'85 square miles of culturable valley from the Kuh-i-Khan Nashin to Bandar-i-Kamal Khan, a length of 126 miles, giving an average width of about one and an eighth mile of culturabe land along the river ; above the Kuh-i-Khan Nashin for the 84 miles to Kala-i-Bist, it is estimated that the culturable area is 3 miles wide on the average. The dasht referred to in the last paragraph is a bare shingle and gravel strewn plain, which has been left high The dasht in the gorge below Rudbar. ^ ^ by some changes that have occurred in the delta. It may have been cultivated when the most ancient mounds or dam were inhabited, as they are surrounded by moats which could have only been filled from the river on the supposition that the river flowed at such a level as to be able to command this dasht. The area if irrigated would be as fertile as the present cultivated area or abadi. The canals could be graded to irrigate it, but at places high expensive banks would be needed as the dasht is in many places isolated as well as high lying. * In this dasht old river beds can be traced; the stream than those in the present river close by. t This river bed is 20 to 25 teetv above the present river bed. t Above Kala Sabz ... ... ...

Fall of the river in feet per mile. In 1 gen measurements were made of the fall of the water surface of the river along a short disconnected length at Khwaja Ah, and again from Ziarat-i-Pania Kash above Kala-i-Madar-i-Padshah to Bandar-i-Kamal Kha n as part of a series of levels which extend over the delta along the various channels, ancient and existing. At Khwaja ’Ah the fall was measured in Feb- ruary when the discharge was just over 4,000 cusecs, the normal discharge during this part of the winter; the measurements extended along 19,000 feet length of river and gave an average fall throughout that length of 2*5 feet a mile ; but this as is usual in rivers everywhere was broken up by short rapids into lengths of flatter slopes that varied from 1*3 feet a mile to 2-5 feet a mile; the rapids had a slope of 10*5 feet a mile. The details are given on the sections Plan No. XXXIX^, the mean velocity at the discharge site where the slope ^was 2*64 feet a mile was 1’B miles* an hour and the maximum \elocity was 36 miles an hour. The maximum velocity over the rapids by calculations would be about 4 miles an hour. The measurements along the river below Ziarat-i-Panja Kash were made in June 1903 when the discharge of the Abstract of measurements made in 1903. river WUS about 15,000 CUSCCS, which is higher than the discharge for the time of the year, because the floods were about three weeks later than is usual, but the volume was about normal for the river during the time it is swelled by the melting of the snow of the Hazarajat. Ziarat-i-Panja Kash is above the site of the band for the present Chahar Burjak Canal, and was the site of the Band-i-Mashf at the head of the ancient canals, which irrigated Kala-i-Fath and the country around Palangi and Paisai, and the slope of the river for 2 miles above the present band or weir is as low as 0-58 feet a mile. The weir was made by placing gabions filled with stone in line across the river, but it is said that the flood of 1885 threw up a permanent bar or weir, so that the temporary weir has not since been needed. The fall of the river, like that of rivers the world over, is in a series of rapids and flat reaches, while the slope gradually becomes less} as the stream descends as will be seen from the Longitudinal Section of the river from which the follow* ing figures have been taken .—vide Sheets of Sections Nos.

Dr. Bellew, in Appendix B of his book “ From the Indus to the Tigris/’ recorded the readings of the aneroid barometer taken at each stage of his ^ t march down the river. These have been plotted, but the readings were on several occasions thrown out by changes of weather as is evident from an examination of the Section Plan No. 2 of the Special Project Plans and Sections up the river. But taking those readings which do not seem to have been affect ed by changes of weather the fall from Kandahar to Kala-i-Bist is 7*0 feet a mile, from Kala-i-Bist to Mian Pushta 5'5 feet a mile, from Melgudar (Khuigi of our map) to Rudbar 5*4 feet a mile, from Rudbar to Chahar Burjak 2*75 feet a mile; these falls are probably not far wrong.

From these gradients it would appear that the Nile below Khartoum is a very much more favourable river to navigate than the Helmand River above Bandar-i-Kamal Khan. In Chapter XLVIII of the “ Revenue Report and Notes ” it is stated that To what extent the met can be navigated. the Sutlej boatmen with the Mission were confident that flat bottomed cargo boats, like those that they used on the Sutlej, could be worked on the parts of the Helmand River with which they were acquainted. These boatmen floated down the river from Khwaja Ali on inflated buffaloe skins (obtained from the Ravi) when the volume in the river was about 5,000 cusecs; they several times went with the Berthon boats up as far as Kala’i-Madar-i-Padshah, and were at work on the river when the volume varied from 20,000 to 1,200 cusecs. The boat brought down to Chahar Burjak by Mr. Merk in 1884 was towed up the river by villagers turned out of the villages along the river. The measurements already quoted shew that the average slope of the river above Khwaja Ali is greater than it is below, and it is probable that the heights at the rapids are so much greater than what they are below that navigation would be much more difficult above Khwdja ’Ali than it is below. The slopes below Bandar-i-Kamal Khan are not much if any greater than they are on parts of the Sutlej and Indus Rivers that are navigable. Although the wind is not so strong up the trough of the Helmand as it is in Seistan, yet it is probably as favourable as it is along the Punjab rivers in the hot season.

Intimately connected with the fall of the river is the material of which the bed is made; above Landiwala Muhammad Amin the boulders are very large; at Khwaja Ali they are of moderate size; at Puza-i-Mashi above Kala-i-Madar-i* Padshah they are about 9 inches long and 6 inches in circumference; at Chahar Burjak they are much the same in size, but not so many of the large ones though the whole bed of the river is still covered solid with gravel; a section is given at the end of Statement M of this Report. Below Chahar Burjak the size of the material on the bed rapidly decreases; at Bandar-i-Kamal Khan the bed is everywhere covered deep in gravel and boulders, but about 5 miles lower down at Gumbad-i-Nadiri the material is only gravel of about walnut size ; at Guzar-i-Mirabad, 6 miles or so, farther doivn the river the ford is a sandy one. Below this occasional beds of gravel are found; they mark the site of rapids and are used as fords, but it is seldom that the gravel extends across the whole river-bed. Gravel was used as a weight to compress the tamarisk of the Band-i-Sultani; it was of the size of an eggforthj most part. Small gravel about the size of peas and hazel nuts mixed was foun in the bed of the Afghan cut at Shahgul, and also in the bed of the Rud-i* Parian near by, in the mound near the mud pillar at Milak and at several phces between Shanfabad and Khadung, but no gravel beds have been noticed ferthei north than the mud pillar of Milak.The band or weirs in the river above Chahar Burjak are made of gabions filled with ooulders called pil ; below Chahar burjak they are made of tamarisk and sand called band-i-khak-i-gaz; in the delta they are made of tamarisk alone called band-i-gaz&gt; or sometimes gazgan.APPENDIX 3.

Notes from the “ Rurki Treatise” page 120. The amount of evaporation depends not so much on the temperature as on the rate at which the vapour can be removed from the surface of the water by the wind; a high temperature has of course a considerable effect, and in America it has been noticed that there is more evaporation from shallow than deep lakes, because the temperature rises higher in the shallow water. Evaporation appears to proceed at night almost as much as during the day.

Extract from The Irrigation of Mesopotamia ” by Sir William Willcocks K.C.M.G., Apnl 1905. {Private and Confidential.) Page l.—No irrigation engineer who has travelled through the country can have faded to ^ve been struck by the great difference between the delta of the NI C on the one hand and the jomt delta of the Euphrates and the Tigris on the other The Nile ,s m flood from August to October; the turbid flSod waters can be retained on the land ,n the historical basins of Egypt and discharged back mto the falhng river in November This permits of the winter cultivation of rich fields of wheat, barley, beans and clover. Such a system of irrigation is impossible in Mesopotamia The rivers are in flood in March, April and May, while the floods are followed by the burning and rainless months of June, July and August, in which irrigation must be praj used if any crop is to be brought to maturity. So that while Egypt was the home of basin irrigation for thousands of years, Mesopotamia was the home of perennial irrigation. This latter class of irrigation needs far more skill and knowledge of hydraulics than basin irrigation, and consequently one is greatly struck by the remains of the ancient regulators and irrigation works whose* ruins are to be met with in the Euphrates valley, while there are no remains of any such works in rtgypt. J The basin system of irrigation introduced by the ancient Egyptians was entirely in keeping with the ancient structures of the type of the pyramids It could defy time and even defy neglect. It was on this account that it survived every revolution and every trouble of many thousands of years ; while its rival the perennial irrigation of the Euphrates valley, fell utterly into ruin and decay. Of the Euphrates valley it was prophesied, as could never have been prophesied of ancient Egypt: “And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees excellency, shall not be dwelt in from generation to generation Perennial* irrigation is no hardy plant like basin irrigation; it needs perpetual and' constant attention ; it is typical of the structures of our days, the darns and weirs on the Nile, which have accompanied the introduction of perennial irriga tion in Egypt, and which need observation and attention to preserve them intact. Modern Egypt is not satisfied with that basin irrigation which has come down from the remotest antiquity,_ but is conferring on the length and breadth of the Nile valley that perennialf irrigation which the Euphrates valley enjoyed for thousands of years, and which struck the imagination of every traveller who saw Babylonia in the days of her glory. In Volume III, page 184 of the “ Encyclopaedia Britannica,” a number of quotations are made from ancient authors about the fertility of Babylonia or Lower Mesopotamia. According to Herodotus, the whole territory was studded with “ a vast number of great cities,” and grain commonly returned 200$ fold to the sower. The cultivation of the country depended on irrigation which was supplied by a large number of canals. Pliny says that wheat was cut twice and after wards was good keep for sheep ; and Berosus remarked that wheat, barley, se same, ochrys, palms, apples and many kinds of shelled fruit grew wild, as wheat does to-day in the neighbourhood of Anah on the Euphrates. Ammianus Marcel- linus states that from the point reached by Julian’s, army to the shores of the Persian Gulf was one continuous forest of verdure. Page 6, The Tigris .—The Tigris enters its delta at Beled, near the site of ancient Opis, where were situated the famous weirs of antiquity and which were described by Tavernier as six fathoms high. I used to think that these weirs were altogether artificial, but an examination of the site has made me think that they were natural bars of very hard conglomerate,§ as hard as the compactest • * * § • But perennial irrigation has been practised in the.del.ta, of the Helmand with the assistance of brushwood weirs renewed annually. fit will be gathered from this that Sir William, Willcocks would not consider the irrigation in Seisin perennial in his meaning of the wordi. J People say the same of Seistan to-day when speaking freely, but our measurements shew that though the yield is great, it is not phenomenal. § Isolated fragments of a similar conjjlaiuerate are found along the Helmand.

Th.s conglomerate can be seen o-day along the left bank of the river from Samarra to nearly opposite Beled. It has a thick, ness of over aa-S feet at Samarra, and under it can be seen some 20 feet of stiff clav above the water’s edge of the Tigris. 1 he conglomerate d,ps under the alluvium of the Tigris below Beled, and its termination was in probability a great cataract near Beled, known locally as “ Sudct N.mrud or N.mrud s dam The Nahrwan and Dijail Canals took out from above these weirs. The Nahrwan Canal was ruined by the Tigris changing its course, and the undermining and sweeping away of these great cataracts sealed the ruin of all the irrigation systems fed by the Upper Tigris, p a „ e 4 rj % Silt in the Tigris and Euphrates.—'Ihz Tigris and Euphrates floods are not gradual like those of the Nile at Assuan ; they are like those of the Blue Nile at Wad Medani, •viz.y a series of rapid rises and falls. Now at the crest of a rise the quantity of deposit carried by the river is extraordinarily great. I happened to hit off a rise of i| metres on the Tigris and the matter carried in suspension was 750 100,000,* or 5 times the suspended matter of the Nile at Cairo in August. Four days afterwards the quantity of suspended matter had fallen to tqof parts in 100,000, which is that of the Nile in August. (Observations on this head might profitably be made on the Atbara and the Blue Nile). Now there can be no doubt that the complete obliteration of the ancient canals of Mesopotamia was due to these heavy deposits. All the canals took off from the Euphrates without weirs, and while they were veritable rivers them selves they preserved their section (for depth will give you velocity as readily as slope will), but when in troubled times they began to be neglected and to silt their beds ; they became like the small canals of to-day, incapable of taking the reasonable waters of the falling floods or the clear waters of the low supplies and had to content themselves with the muddy waters of the crests of the rises of the river, which gradually choked them up and ended by absolutely obliterating them, bigas they were. One has only to see the Euphrates at Babylon today to under stand how fast this obliteration can proceed. To obviate these disadvantages, I consider it will be essential for all schemes of irrigation in Mesopotamia to take off canals from above Egyptian barrages. When a rising flood, surcharged with suspended matter, is coming down, the barrage will be fully opened and the canal head closed for a few days until the quantity of suspended matter has greatly fallen, and then the head will be opened and the barrage regulated on. In this way the very heavily charged waters will flow down to the rice fields and the low lands of the lower sections where they will be much needed, and will be kept out of the upper canals where they would only be a nuisance. * One in 133 much the same as at the height of the Helmand flood of 1904, vide Statement G of this Report, t One part in 714. lo March 1905 the Helmand flowed for 7 days after high flood before the proportion fell to this.APPENDIX 5.

The masonry work is usually stone laid in Portland cement mortar, whereas that on canals is of brick laid in mortar made of local lime.f APPENDIX 6. [To Chapter XIV, page 95 ]. CONTENTS.

This supply varies from one and three quarters (on the Chenab Canal) to two^and-a-half (on the Western Jamna Canal) times the average spring crop supply. From Table 12 of Statement A of this Report it is seen that the monthly maximum supply is 8,293 cusecs run in March, but it is possible that the canals will be made to carry 10,000 cusecs on occasion; if so, this will be about two-and-a-half times the average supply of 4,070 cusecs. * The high rate on the Sirhind Canal is due to (i) heavy expenditure on a long length of special railway needed for the works (ii) high establishment charges due to the long period over which the expenditure was spread, and (iii) to the great cost of an elaborate system of minor distributaries ; the low rate on the L icna is due to the large area of land so easily commanded by the head works. The supply has already been increase to 10,750 cusecs and the average area at the next decade will be about 2,000,000 acres without much increase to the capital cost. The high rate of cost of the Jhelum is mainly due to insufficient land to fuHy utilise the head works, while that of the proposed Lower Bari Doab from the Sutlej was due to 70 mil s 1 line in deep cutting to feed a comparatively small area. t Estimated. X No weir across river. [S644FD] TT166 l_App. 6. With reference to the cost per acre irrigated annually it may be noticed that the spring crop duty on the Helmand is likely to be^ much higher than that on the Punjab canals, but in the calculations by which the one million acres were obtained no credit was taken for this, whereas a full deduction was made for the poor autumn crop duty that is probable. The cost of the works on the Helmand calculated from the volume and from the area do not therefore agree, and the essential difference between works in the Punjab and in beistan comes into marked contrast in this calculation. Since the supply is 10,000 cupecs and the acreage a 1,000,000, the difference of the two methods of calculation is easily seen from a comparison of the figures in the columns two and three in the table above. Distribution of capital cost on main heads of account. The following statement shews how much per cent, of the capital cost for works only is spent on each main head of account, and will be useful when reading Chapters XII to XVI :— Name of perennial canal.

The saving in the head-works on the first three canals is absorbed in the greater expenditure on the main line (the proportionate cost of the branches is probably much the same for all the canals) and on drainage and protective works. On the Helmand River for works at Bandar-i-Kamal Khan the proportionate cost of the head-works would be much the same as on the first three canals, because the trough of the Helmand gives great facilities for weir building, while the expenditure on drainage and protec tive works, apart from expenditure in the inundated area, would be the same as that on the last three canals. The proportionate cost of main line and branches would perhaps be between that for the first three and that for the last three canals on account of the excavation in the hard sirr with a tendency to be the same as that of the last three as the proportionate cost of regulators, falls and weirs, river and hill torrent works would be small. There should be a saving on distributaries also, but the drainage works in the inundated area will be very expensive and absorb all the savings on the other items, and it is probable that for this reason, and because these would be the first works constructed in these parts, the cost per cusec of supply or acre irrigated would approach that of the Sirhind Canal which is the most expensive of these canals ; were it not for these drainage works, the cost should correspond with that of the cheaper canals like the Western Jamna or Chenab.App. 6.] I 67 The income per acre on the average annual area irrigated on some of the Punjab Perennial Canals.

It was made by the mistri in charge of the works; but the arrange ment for sending the blast of wind into the furnace of the kiln is said to be the devise of one of the Seistani masons. The walls of the kiln are made of sundried bricks. Besides the cost of Making of the kiln. bricks used in making the kiln, the cost of labour is as follows:— One Ustad or mason at 3 kran a day Five coolies each at | kran a day Daily wages Kran, 3 3 f 6f The kiln is made in 3 days ; so the total cost of the labour to make the kiln is 20 kran. Limestone for the Nasratdbdd Consulate is brought from the west shore of .. . the Sdbari Hamiln to the north of Bahrins:. Inere are two places in this neighbourhood where limestone is found in useful quantities, viz^ Dasht-i-Sabzkimand Shahr-i- Mir Alam Khan. The Kadkhuda of the lands on which the limestone is collected charges 7 per \oo man Seistani. The Saiyads themselves collect the stones and bring them on tutin from the northern shore of the Sdbari Hamun to Adimi. From Adimi the limestone is carried on donkeys into the Consulate. A strong donkey can carry only 10 man Seistani of limestone from Adimi into the city. Smaller donkeys carry only 8 man Seist&amp;ni. The total cost per 100 man Seistani of limestone delivered at the Consulate is as follows:— (1) Share of Kadkhuda of the land from which the limestone is collected (2) Carriage (including collection) of limestone from Bahring to Adimi on tutin.

The loading is done by an ustad or master mason, who has to make the flues of a triangular section. These are made by arrangmg hree bricks on end without anv mortar in the joint in such a way as to enclose a triangle ; the number of flues is 22 ; the limestone is loaded into the kiln as these flues are made. On top of the arches before loading in any limestone a layer of brick on end is arranged. The ustad says if no bricks are put, the fire is so intense that the limestone immediately above the arches is over-burnt; if the fire is not made so strong, then the stone at the top of the kiln is not properly burnt. At the top of the kiln over the stone three layers of flat bricks are arranged to prevent the heat of the fire from escaping. Then the whole is plastered over. The cost of loading includes cost of slight repairs done to the kiln after every operation. The fuel used is khar, the thorny bush found in plenty about Nasratdbdd.

The soil is a loam of very even texture and is usually very hard even in the cultivated tract, off the cultivated tract in the deserts and on the plateaux it is intensely hard and compact almost a soft stone. Under these circumstances there is no object in burying the foundations. The walls of ancient buildings are very skilfully designed to the weight to be borne, and the load on the foundations works out to one ton a square foot • as the soil at the Consulate is liable to become water-logged each flood season, the foundations of the bank were spread, so that the load was reduced to half a ton a square foot. The burnt bricks of the walls up to the plinth level were laid in lime mortar above that in mud mortar, except door jambs, arches of all sorts and the walls under the rcof w r here lime mortar was used. It w r as the wish of the Manager to have a flat roof and thin walls instead of the domes and thick walls common in Seistan, A comparative estimate shewed that a house built with a roof carried on steel beams would not cost more than a house built all of burnt brick having a domed roof, provided that the steel beams delivered at site did not cost more than twice their price at Quetta.f fin the result the carriage cost about Rs. 12-8 7770 ^ Rs. 6 a maUIld. A building of SUH- dried w T alls supporting sundried domes would have been much cheaper. Such buildings are difficult to light, as the walls of large rooms are about 5 or 6 feet thick. They are also cold in winter, as the sun does not get into and warm the air of the rooms. a maund and the beams therefore cost three times their value at Quetta The Imperial Bank obtained their steel beams, teak doors and windows, timber stores, etc., from Messrs. Cosser and Co ,{ Karachi, who also lent them one of their foremen, who was paid Rs. 150 a month. He brought with him three masons on Rs. 50 and two carpenters on Rs. 60 a month. All these men were excellent workmen and gave great satisfaction. They were paid travelling allow ance to and from Seistan and Karachi. The forwarding of material was done by the Punjab Bank at Quetta, as at that time rail-head was at Quetta.

Two rooms should not be connected to the same badgir ; the sound travels through the openings in the walls and destroys the privacy of the rooms. There are photographs of the Consulate^ and the Bank Buildings. No copies of the plans were kept; the original drawings of the Bank buildings are in possession of the Bank; but Mistri Ganga Singh has a photograph of the plan of the Bank Manager’s house, which has more rooms than the Assistant Manager’s house. A large number of ancient buildings were measured and drawn by Babu Ghulam Kadir; these (filed among the. plans) will give the sizes of rooms and dimensions of walls which can be easily built in Seistan. The interesting and useful experience gained in building these houses for the Bank has been collected in notes by Lala Thakur Dass and Zilladar Amir Singh which may now be given. Steel Beams* The beams where designed to be not more than 16 feet long or two Indian maunds in weight; but experience proved that beams 20 feet long and 2’5 to three Indian maunds in weight could have been brought out on camels. The only real difficulty in the carriage of beams was from Quetta to Nushki, and then only on the short section of the road from Kishingi to Nushki, because the road is carried close to the hill-side at many places. At these places the loads had to be altered, so that the beams lie along the camels back instead of across. Eight men had to walk with each camel to manipulate the beam at bad places, so that a long time was occupied in working the kafila over that section of the road. The kafila took 24 days from Quetta to Nushki and 42 days from Nushki to Seistan or 66 days in all, and arrived in Seistan about the end of August.f The railway has now been extended past this Ghat Section to Nushki; the road and the grazing from Nushki to Seistdn is good, so that in future l there should be much less difficulty in getting out these loads. Bags of grass or bhusa wffiere placed on either side of the camel saddles and the beams were loaded cross-ways. Some particularly big camels carried 4 of the 16' steel beams a load of 8 or 9 maunds. Many camels carried 6 beams 8 feet long, weighing nearly 7 Indian maunds, while a smaller camel was loaded with four such beams weighing about 4J Indian maunds. A large camel carried 4 sleepers io' long and a small camel tw T o. The rate paid for all the material carried whether beams, wood work or stores was 4 pies per maund per mile. The distance is 600 miles. The general average of the loads the mistri said was 5 maunds a camel, so that each camel earned Rs. 62^ on the journey which lasted a little over two months. The rate per maund was 12J rupees, so that the cost of the carriage of the steel beams was more than twice its value at Quetta; the proportionate enhancement of value of timber work was even greater. Now that the railway has reached Nushki the rate, as well as the distance, will be less, as Nushki is a much more popular place with camel-owners than Quetta; there is more grazing and the too miles of difficult road through the passes is avoided. The work at the Bank was pushed on through the winter, when days are The cost of the work at the Bank. short an d cold and the cost of work was no doubt much enhanced thereby, as the Seistdni works better when the weather is pleasant. The gangs employed were * During 1903 steel beams 16 feet long, g^inches deep and 4inches broad, weighing four maunds each, had been brought out to rest-houses on the trade Route. t The caravan travelled along the trade route in kafila ol 300 camels and experienced no difficulty for grazing or for water. + Since the above was written the following notice in the Public Press has been issued by the political officer in charge ° clNi° Ute .’u , b , e . see ? t ^ at . t he rates of carriage to Meshed are now less than they were in 1904 to Seistan.

This is a very bad shape for a brick, but it is in universal use in Seist&amp;n; a half or a double brick is also made. The rates paid were two to three kran a thousand at the moulding floor; the lower rate is for bricks to build, and the latter for bricks cleaned and trimmed suitable to burn. These rates are much the same as would be paid on Punjab canals for best bricks. The rate at the time the Consulate was built was 2 kran, but the number of skilled moulders is limited and a good deal of building was going on while the Bank was being built. The bricks are good slop moulded ones; no sand moulding is done even for bricks to be afterwards burnt. Care must be taken to avoid land on which the salts have concentrated on the surface. The bricks should be thoroughly dried before being built into t e work. The damp carries the salts in the bricks to the surface and t en t e plaster peels off. Much trouble was experienced from this m building in the winter when days were short and material took long to dry. * The kran in Seistan is subdivided into 8 Shahi. x ^ x y, thick are f oun d.

A donkey will also bring in two or three loads a day and the rule is a kran a day for the hire of the donkey.. One acre of land is stript of its bushes to provide fuel for one kiln, i.e., when the khar is plentiful; but on the average one acre of the deltaic land will outturn about one thousand burnt bricks. The kiln. . bricks are burnt in the same flame kiln* that is used in the Multan and Muzaffargarh districts. There too the same flat brick is used by the people doubt less, because it burns easier with the flame. As a rule, the firing only lasts one day if khar is used and two days if tamarisk is used. The bricks when burnt measure 8'' X 7}' X if' on the average, and 14 The bcick. bricks go to the cubic foot, and 20 to 25 . # cubic feet of mortar are needed to the mo cubic feet of masonry. The bricks weigh about 6 lbs. a brick ; they absorb about 26 per cent, by weight of water, whereas a good brick should not absorb more than 17 per cent. Lime mortar. The manufacture of lime is described in Appendix y. It is bought ready made at the rate of 66 kran\ per 100 Seistan man of unslaked lime; that yields about 30 cubic feet of slaked lime.

In considering the cost of large canal works it is as important to know the cos of good .me, and whether .t can be obtained in large quant tie as it is to know the cost of earthwork, and the labour that will ' 4 ' ’ excavate. be available to In Seistdn in ancient times very little lime was used, and this little was Lime used in ancient times. obtained fiom limestone pebbles about two inches in diameter and half an inch thick which can be gathered on the high plateaux, the surface of strewn with gravel of all kinds amongst which are these limest an which are :one pebbles. Their quantity is limited and the correct pebbles must be searched for one bv one like shells on the sea shore. The waste* heaps of old limekilns many o'f which can be found, shew that the labourers in those days brought in lots of pebbles that were not of limestone ; but the pebble has a characteristic dark ^rev colour and rough surface that makes it easy to distinguish. ^ 7 There are also limestone boulders in the river-bed above Bandar-i-Kamal Sources of lime stone. Khan, but they are of small size and in quantity sufficient only for comparatively small works. 1 he lime tor the works at the Consulate was made from limestone that was brought from across the Hamun as already described in Appendix 7 of this Report. The boulders are small being only a few pounds in weight, but are very convenient to burn and are collected with ease. The gravel plateau on the western shore of the Hamiin near the Kuh-i-Khwaja are also rich in limestone pebbles of a larger size (would pass through a three inch mesh) than is usually found on the plateaux through which the river has cut its trough. For making the boundary pillars limestone was sent for from the hills near Tarsh Ab, a stage across the Hamun on the road from Seistan to Bam. These boulders were very large being several pounds in weight, they burnt well and made excellent lime, as good a fat lime as it is possible to get. The supply of limestone along the hills is unlimited, the Nar Ahu hills, on which Boundary Pillars Nos. 88 and 90 are situated were found to be of solid limestone, and in Vredenburg’s “ Geological Notes on Baluchistan ” many lime stone formations are described. So that though the material for making lime on the spot is likely to be limited, yet unlimited quantities can be got arnage ' by carriage from the hills. The carriage may amount to 100 miles, and will be expensive because the country is very unhealthy for camels. The usual rate for carriage is already 4 pies a maund a mile, over two rupees a 100 maunds a mile, whereas in the Punjab 8 annas a 100 maunds is the almost universal rate for such carriage. Individual camels that can be hired in the Punjab for Rs. 6 a month on the frontier cost from 15 to 20 rupees a month. Camels are plentiful ; in the healthy season they come in large numbers to carry away grain, and (in the healthy season) would come from the surrounding districts of Afghanistan, Persia and Baluchistan in large numbers to work. The fuel for burning limestone in the cultivated tract is plentiful, but away from the cultivated tract no fuel exists; Fuel. even in the hills there is hardly likely to be fuel enough to burn lime, though against this view are the large heaps of slag of ancient copper smelting works, the fuel for which must have been obtained iiuhe hills. . * Utle mounds of this material are found on the line of ruins from KaWi F ath to G awa k- Sorne calcined pebbles are also found on the gravel plain between Boundary Pillars Nos. 13 a '^ 2 7 ’ !,^ rv h been blown from off this plain, but it is covered with remains of ancient villages mai e y anc p y.iff ^ 184 [App. 9, »&gt; , •• * • • i j ■ The fuel* in the cultivated tract is all scrub bushes, chiefly khar, the camel-thorn, and chaghuk, the dwarf jand bush ; these burn in flame kilns are verTeffiden fuel. Up the valley the area that grows th.s fuel is very limited Ind it is here, if a weir were built, that the largest mass of bricks and lime would be required. As has been said all lime and bricks required for the burnt brick buildings at the Consulate and Bank were burnt with this fuel f. No difficulty was fxnerienced in obtaining as much as was required. The Se.stam uses the same fuel to bake his bread in the tunur ,or oven heated by the flame from these bushes ; in winter they go far afield to collect the days supply At the Con- sulate in summer fuel for manufactures is obtained close by, but at the end of winter the lead was about 3 miles. On the Chenab Canal the jand tree growth in the Bars was only suffi cient to burn the bricks and lime for those works ; although the fuel used on the head works was nearly all coal from Dandote. Although the tamarisk thickets along the Helmand and in the Miankangi seem very extensive to the surveyor, who has occasionally to drag a chain through them, yet to the engineer with large quantities of lime and bricks to burn they are very limited in exten . Tamansk wood does not go so far as jand as a fuel. Frqnri Appendix I it wi be gathered that there is veFy little fuel in the Hazdrajat either. Fuel will certainly be a difficulty if large works are constructed before a railway is opened to bring coal from the mines near Quetta. The camel-thorn of the irrigated lands and the wormwood of the hills are both rich in a very inflammable spirit; and it is probable that a sp en id fuel could be made by compressing these shrubs into briquettes. Or the spirit might be extracted and burnt in properly constructed spirit furnaces, much the same as is done on the plains of Germany, where fuel is scarce. Ihe subject is one of very great importance along this part of the frontier. A lime sufficiently hydraulic for canal works could be made^ by mixing and grinding the white lime with burnt clay in Hydraulic mortar. ^ f orm 0 f sur J c hi or by Some One of the methods known to engineering. It is possible that careful search might discover deposits of kankar ; some were noticed and tested, but the lime obtained was very poor. The alluvial makes good bricks, not perhaps so hard as those made in Northern India, but the quality of the work Bncks ’ in the ancient burnt brick buildings and in the Consulate is as good, if not better, than in the yvorks on the old Jamna Canal which were built between A. D. 1820 and 1857. The lime used in those wor s was inferior to the lime found in the base of the Mil-i-Kasimabad, the dome of the Surkh Gumbad at Kala-i-Fath, and the small burnt brick bridge near Peshawaran. It is quite certain that skilled labour from India could bind just as good works in Seistan as they do in Quetta. But the cost is hkely to be higher than at present prevails at Quetta, though never so high as the rates in the days when railways, roads and barracks were first made in Baluchis tan in the early eighties. In the gorge of the Helmand above Bandar-i-Kamal Khan concrete will no doubt be the most economical and efficient Concrete. material for large works. The boulders though not large or plentiful will no doubt be quite sufficient for all the work to be done. They will require to be crushed to make a reliable concrete, but this will not be expensive, as water power can always be got to work the crushers * The fuel in the hills is also all scrub which is renewed each spring and gives an excellent flame when burnt. t An area of land in the watered part of the delta yields enough khar to burn 1,000 bricks or 100 cub^ feet of lime (on the average).

The method by which the stone was got out was not discovered, no drilled holes could be found, though a few marks of drifts for wedges were discovered. The basalt is in huge blocks and the labour of splitting them up into mill stones must have been great. There are vast quantities of quarry spawl too small to be of any use and much of it very rotten indicating that there are layers of stone not durable as well as durable stone. The people say that the stone is too hard and difficult to quarry for stone for mills, and such stones are now brought from Bandan.

When the water is out the stone could be conveyed' in tutin to the main land to be there loaded on pack donkeys or bullocks of which there are large numbers in Seistan —vide Chapter XLIi of the “ Revenue and General Report.” The length of land carriage from the Kuh-i-Khwaja to works in the river above Bandar-i-Kamal Khan would be from 60 to 70 miles; this is considerable and would add greatly to the cost of the material delivered on the work. The quarrying should not be expensive all the faces are open;* powder „ . is made in the country ; expert labour is perhaps not obtainable, but the work is simple and once the right stamp of man is obtained they are quickly trained and the work is popular. All the able-bodied men in the villages around the salt range quarries at Taraki, in the Jhelum district, are experts at quarrying stone. If a railway were made, it would be sure to pass near some excellent lime and sandstone in the Baluchistan Rail carnage. hills. But works could be started and built without the assistance of railways just as the big canal works on the Jamna and Ganges were built before the railways were made. In fact to this day there is no railway to the head works of the Jamna canals ; there is every reason to believe that material will be forthcoming at a cost that can be afforded without a railway. * * This hill is an ideal place for big blasts such as were used on the Nalagarh quarries for the Rupar weir in 1878 ; and for the Taraki quarries for the Chenab weir in 1891. Detail reports will be found in the office of the Superintending Engineer in which the Chenab weir reports are filed. S644FD AAAAPPENDIX ia [To Chapter XI, page 67.] CONTENTS.

If therefore we put down Rs. 22 per acre for dykes we shall have made ample provision. In the masonry works on the main canals I propose no change and leave the original figure of Rs. 37 per acre. The earthwork of the main canals will be calculated from detailed estimates @ Rs. io'S per 1,000 cubic feet.

These steam ploughs are the stand-by of every large estate in Egypt. The Daira Sanieh has 30. In Egypt the cost of the maintenance of weirs, canals, and drains amounts to Rs. 13 per acre per annum.

Land of the quality of that in sections (4) and (9) when provided with perennial irrigation in Egypt, brings in Rs. 800 per acre as rent and pays a tax of Rs. 130 per acre, leaving Rs. 67a per acre as the net annual yield. If we assume that this land in Mesopotamia will rent at less than half this or Rs. 352 per acre, of which Rs. 93 per acre will go in rates and taxes; there will remain Rs. 259 per acre as net profit per annum. I have assumed this figure in the estimates. The allowance of 6,106 cubic feet per acre per day is attained in Duty of water. onl y durin g the floods when the whole country is under crop in the hot months of August and September. In Mesopotamia the seasons are not those of Egypt, and this figure of 6,106 will only be attained in May, June and Tuly when the whole country will be under Indian-corn and cotton. Later on there will remain only the cotton on the ground and this will cover one-third the area In winter about one-third of the water is required which is needed in summer'. In winter, therefore, when the whole country will be under winter crops, the water needed will be 2,180 cubic feet per acre per day. In May, June and July it will be 6,106, and m August and September 2,180. October will generally be a fallow month.

Mr.Johns.' note on the cost of excavating in the hard Seistdn clay. Mr. W. A. Johns Consulting Engineer for Railways, who made the Railway Reconnaissance for tne Mission, has kindly given the following note about this hard alluvial. I noticed the lacustrine (?) deposit of Seistdn and concluded that it was Mari a,a y , Pfcisely the same as the red cTay . , . f an ^ san ^ stone deposits of the Lower Sind- pishin and Lower Mushkaf^ The only difference is that the clay hills surround ing the Sibi pat have been disturbed and thrown on edge by some form of cosmic action and thus form high mountaiori f 4,000 to feet high in places, whereas the Seistan deposit is still horizontal. The Nari («.£?., near Sibi) beds’ are red and so probably a marine formation ; the Seistan are white and clearly—to my mind, but I am not an expert—lacustrine. J Near Nari there are numerous bands of soft sandstone in the clay ; at some places there is more sandstone than clay, but near Mushkaf the clay predomi nates. Sometimes high cliffs of clay without a single band of sandstone, except the usual thin covering at top are met with. The same deposit skirts the coasts of Mekran, but the clay is there light blue in colour and the sandstone is often a mass of oyster shells. The Seistan deposit had just the same beds of very soft sandstone, only *We noticed this with some of the hard alluvial softer, and the same thin layers of gypsum excavated for Boundary Pillars. as th e Nari clays ; the latter clay air slaked* rapidly on exposure, and, owing to irregularities in stratification, was treacher ous to excavate without considerable timbering, if the excavation were wide or had been exposed to the air for a time. I have done a lot of work in this Nari deposit -in cuttings and tunnels; it is, I think, somewhat harder than the Cost of excavation. Seistan clay ; owing to the pressure it was subjected to when thrown up into mountains ; on the other hand, for the same reason, it is fuller of ‘ backs ’ and cross beds than a horizontal deposit—more shaly in fact. In cutting l paid Rs. 20 to Rs. 25 per 1,000 cubic feet the rate varying with the amount and hardness of the sandstone bands. Country powder and pnzing with crowbars fetches it very easily. The Hazaras, who are very fine workmen, used occasionally to ‘chop’ it underneath and work it out in falls either by blasting or by prizing. Beyond Quetta on the Peshin plain there is the same white clay that is met with on the Helmand. The men used to White clay Of the Pesbin plain. undercut it and work it out^ in falls ; the rate was probably not more than 15 to 20 rupees per thousand cubic feet. On the Hurnai line three single line tunnels were driven through this clay; the width was 20 feet ; two of them_ gave no trouble : the excavation was done to full section first of all and the lining built afterwards ; t e} vou not stand without lining owing to the beds of sandstone and sha y c ara^ter 0 t e clay. With reference to the cost of making °r l ar S e tunnels to carry water \ on the Muskaf I made through Experience on MulhCaf^Bokn tunnels. these clays six tunnels all quite short, and all three-quarter lined, i.e., sides and top, the thickness of the brick wor ein H ’ two feet.

The explosives (chiefly dynamite) cost about Rs. 9 per lineal foot ; powder was found not to give such good results as dynamite. All holes were bored by hand. The headings were usually untimbered. The work had to be hurried on, hence the free ammunition and high bonuses on progress to the English miners, but it was carried out in the heat of that terrible climate.

I do not think a kariz could be dug in the Seistan clay (chopping only and no explosives) for less than Rs. 100 to Rs. 125! per thousand cubic feet; a heading would cost about five times as much as open work in the same stuff. I am of opinion that in that hard clay so long as it was not disturbed by . blasting a temfoot heading would stand Limit or size of r ,1 u ^ r i. u perfectly well, even 15 or 20 feet would stand temporarily. But it would not be worth it. Weathering would be certain to set in. A half or whole brick lining would not cost much and would make the work permanent as sooner or later all kariz tumble in. The nature of the material should be thoroughly tested by trial pits, as the surface is often quite soft, while a few feet down it is extremely hard. As to velocity with top and sides lined, and bottom properly protected with Vei cit in kariz gravel, eight feet a second should be quite safe. * See Proceedings Institute Civil Engineer, Volume CXXVIII, 1896-97, Part II, page 257, Paper No. 3005, “ The tunnels on the first division of the Mushkaf Bolan.” t The bands of soft sandstone could not be worked with a pick ; explosives would be necessary when these were met with, and the cost in such cases should not be estimated at less than Rs. 250 per 1,000. The jump fiOm the estimated rate through the clay appears unduly sudden, but the explosives are certain to cost quite, Rs. 7 a foot run, whatever the size of the heading. In fact the figure is if anything rather low.APPENDIX 12. CONTENTS. On the cost of excavation in the culturable soil of the delta and in the HARD TOUGH ALLUVIAL OF THE HIGH PLATEAUX OR dasht.

The soil in the cultivated tract though easy to dig stands well and is a very admirable mixture of finely divided allumina and sand. &amp; From measurements made progress varying from 78 to 111 cubic feet a Rate or cost. head a da y is mad e by the gangs of culti vators turned out to do this work. The progress of 78 and 111 cubic feet was obtained on embankments about 6 feet high and 24 feet wide at the base, the earth coming from a trench at the toe that became 4 or 5 feet deep. The difficulty of the work was much the same for each rate of progress. The progress on the retired embankment of the Band-i*Seistan was 100 cubic feet of sand a head a day ; in this a deep trench could not be dug and the sand was thrown from shallow borrow pits close by. A progress of 100 cubic feet a day can be expected from able bodied agri culturists in Seist&amp;n in excavation in the culturable soil of the delta; such a workman contributes his labour as his share of the up-keep of the work; were he JThat is about Rs. 2 annas 12 a 1,000 cubic feet. paid, he WOuld expect tO Cam OUQ kran % §Rs 4 annas 2 a 1,000 cubic feet. a day, and if 3 . large number such labour ers were needed a kran§ and a half a day would be expected. The cost of the earthwork done by the Imperial Bank was also from 10 to 15 kran a 1,000 cubic feet or Rs. 2 annas 12 to Rs. 4 a 1,000 cubic feet ; a high rate considering that the earth is only thrown up and not dressed or finished in any way. Similar work done by hoe and basket work in Northern India would cost about 2 rupees a 1,000 cubic feet. The earthwork of canals and embankments is done by mutual co-operation and not on payment; there is no clearly defined know ledge in the country of the rate of the cost of excavation, and the value of labour here given must be taken as an opinion gained from a limited experience on building boundary pillars and on the Imperial Bank buildings rather than as an actual fact. The earth scraper or plough drawn by bullocks used so much along the Indus and near Quetta to make embank- arth plough. ments is not known in Seistan, perhaps because no big banks are made or because throwing earth from near by with the hsha is more rapid ; a still more probable reason is that the cultivator oes not own bullocks and the cattle-owner is not liable to render his labour on irriga tion works of any kind. The hard alluvial or sirr.

The alluvial deposit of Seistdn is of immense area; it extends from the f lacis of the Baluchistan hills to the glacis of the Palan Kuh ; the hills south of lerat and to the skirt of the Hazarajat mountains. The whole of this great •The Ganges and Indus basin are also filled basin is filled with alluvial * except for a with alluvial; but it is comparatively soft and at a few Solitary OUt'CrOpS of rock like the Kuhri-Khao Nashin, Kdh-i-Guch, Kuh-i- face is apparently bottomless. Khw^ju, etc. We first noticed this alluvial at Nawdb Khan Chah on the route from Galur to the Kuh-i-Khdn Nashin. The well is described in Appendix 37 of the “ Revenue Report and Notes”; the sides of the well through the alluvial stand without steining. The alluvial everywhere i§ covered with a yery thin layer (the thickness of the pebbles) of waterworn gravel; below this layer is a few inches of decomposed alluvial, and below that hard alluvial of bottomless depth. The trough of the Helmand is bounded by cliffs of this hard alluvial that stand almost vertical to a height of 200 to 300 feet, and at the Puza-i*Dasht-i-Margo the height is 800 feet. The outer surface of these cliffs is decomposed, but ,a few inches down the hard alluvial is met. At many places along the boundarv \ye had occasion to quarry into these cliffs and remove blocks of harder indurated sand qr clay for building pillars. The blocks could only be got out by unkeying the joints and forcing them out with a crowbar. If the block was placed in water, it gradually dissolved and silt remained. Some blocks were impregnated with salts and cracked and decom posed when exposed to rain. The alluvial is in layers ; there are many geological differences between the layers such as different colours of alluvial, bands of pure salt, plaster of Paris, indurated clay or lime, etc., which do not concern this note, as they are not likely to affect to any appreciable extent the cost of excavation or the use of the material for engineering purposes. The same alluvial is met at a depth of 10 or 20 feet below the cultivated lands : in deserts like that around Sar-o-tar Underlies cultivated tract. ,, , j m i l the upper decomposed sou has been blown away and in most places only the hard alluvial remains. In the Hamun and Naizar the softer material is very shallow and the hard sirr is soon met with. The Seistani calls this hard tough alluvial sirr wherever he meets it, whether in excavation or in the bed or banks of the river. He knows it at once by the difficulty of chopping it with his tisha. It varies in hardness but is nowhere easy to excavate. taken out above Bandar-i-Kamdl Kh&amp;n and carried at a high level to gain command would be cut through this alluvial for along distance. It would also be met with in a deep canal cuttings in many places in the cultivated tract as well as in the deserts that were once cultivated. Any large canal that w r as Channels for big canals must cut through it. Existing works in the hqrd alluvial. In many places ancient canals have been cut through it; some of them of considerable size. Many kariz are also bored through it; all of small size, about five feet high by as many broad. At Tirkoh on the right bank of tjie river opposite Dak-i- Dila some caves have been made in this material, having rooms 20 feet long and 10 feet wide and feet high, the roof being cut out of the same shape as the dome to a Seistani building ; the caves are in excellent preservation and are likely to last for ever. The river of course is cut dqwn through this alluvial and now flows in a In the river-bed. Val,e 7 * hoVLt thre . e 0r foUT timeS ‘^ S 0Wn breadth, so that it can only meander to ft limited extent. At places the alluvial is exposed on the banks of the river to the action of water at all seasons, but in most places it is covered under shingle and is only scoured in high flood when the shingle is on the move. On the left bank above the Bandri-Seistan the river is flowing under the alluvial cliff; other places are under Ziarat Panja Kash above Puza*irMashi, Ka)a Hussainabad, Gumbad-i-Nadiri, Dak-irDila, etc. At all such places the alluvial resists the action of the river and appears capable of resisting the scour of a high velocity. The people themselves say that at Band-i-Puza-i-Mashi, Chahar- burjak and Bandard-Kamdl Khan the river is held up by bars of unscoured alluvial and thus account for the excellence of these fords. But an examination of the bed at low river in September 1904 showed that there was a deep deposit of shingle all along the river-bed and at no places was the alluvial found to beiere not pai 1 ererj 4 i ^ ee: fere then ha so that a ma Since tf Sdar, it is i and that the; result that it Punjab this i lith a minin The alii ipees a thoi lind that wl tkiiinNort fell cost at 1 excavation o softer substr kn by dm and the unde is perhaps to Hasting with In App Experience four exper cubic feet of b| outside la 'Moved a n material rem dourer to r .

There are indications in the hiah pl a . teau or dasht that there are softer pockets in this material; there are deposits of salt, lime, etc., where these occur there would be trouble and difficulty to maintain channels in which water flowed at high velocity. Cost of excavation m the hard alluviaL We could not find any canal that has been recently excavated through this alluvial, but the head reach of the Bandar-i-Nau Canal passes through the alluvial on the gravel plain south of Deh Sahib Khan near Kala-i-Roden. One of the most knowledgeable of our guides said he worked on this excavation when Sardar Muhammad Umar Khan dug the canal in 1883, although the cultivators were not paid for the work in the cultivated area they were paid one gajri for every 42 feet length of channel that they dug in the sirr or hard alluvial ; wages were then half a kran a day, the work in this length of channel is 150 cubic feet so that a man should excavate 37^ cubic foot a day to earn wages. Since the men were cultivators of the proposed canal and henchmen of the Sardar, it is probable that the rate allowed did not enable them to earn full wages and that they took more than four days to do the task, but we arrive at the result that it took from 40 to 28 men a day to excavate 1,000 cubic feet; in the Punjab this would mean a rate of 10 rupees a thousand cubic feet for excavation with a minimum of lead. The alluvial is harder than the alkali plain through which the Feeder Line Comparison with Feeder Line Chenab Canal. ^ the Lower Chenab Canal W 3 S Cat in 1090-92 tor which a rate between 8 and 10 rupees a thousand had to be paid for work carried to four chains. Bearing in mind that when a large canal is cut in Seistan, labour rates will be much higher than in Northern India it is certain that excavation in this hard ancient alluvial well cost at least 20 rupees a thousand and probably a great deal more. The excavation on the Feeder Line above referred to was got out by sinking pits to a softer substratum and then under cutting, the block thus unkeyed being broken down by driving in hard-wood wedges. In this alluvial there are no softer layers and the under-cutting will be much more difficult; at the same time the material is perhaps too tough and tenacious and not sufficiently brittle for successful blasting with powder.

Neverthe- ess even 28 rupees a thousand cubic feet is not a high rate to pay for driving ■ he heading of a tunnel, and leads to the hope that experts in the use of the pick cvould be able to cut this hard alluvial at a lower rate than has been estimated n this note : the best of the labour would come from the Hazarajat, these men ire experts with the pick ; one or two seasons work would make them proficient, md if good arrangements were made to train them at the start the rate should : all as work progressed.

Explanation of the meaning attached to the words clay and silt in these notes. Some engineers object to the use of the word clay for alluvial deposits and restrict the word to the glacial deposit found in Europe-^ discussion on Mr. Leake s paper on the Rup Narain Bridge, Proceedings, Institute Civil En gineers, \ olume CLI, page 282. The material in Seistan would be called silt bv the purist, as it all, even the hardest, dissolves in water being built up in balls in such a way that each layer when wet peels from the next like the skins off an onion. The following extract from page 46 of Dr. Page’s Manual* on Geology ♦ William Blackwood and Sons, Edinburgh, describes clay, silt, and alluvial as used ' these notes. Extract is from eleventh edition. in Argillaceous Compounds* Mud is the familiar as well as technical term applied to the fine impalpable matter worn and borne down by water, and deposited at the bottoms of seas, lakes and pools. It is thus composed of the finely-comminuted debris of mineral, vegetable and animal matter. Clay is also a fine impalpable sediment from water, but consists wholly, or almost so, of alumino-silicious particles. It is usually tough and plastic, and differs from mud in this respect as well as in the absence of vegetable and animal matter. Fire-clay and Fullers'-earth are varieties of clay ; the former from the absence of alkaline earths, such as potash and soda, resisting the action of the strongest heat ; and the latter (anhydrous silicate of alumina) from its absorbent nature being employed in the fulling and scouring of greasy woollens. Silt is a geological term for the miscellaneous matter deposited in lakes, estuaries, bays, and other still waters. Silt may thus consist of intermingled mud, clay and sand, or of distinct layers of these. Shale is merely consolidated mud assuming a structure less or more laminated. This laminated or shaly (splitting) structure distinguishes it from beds of clay and marl, which are massive and amorphous. Mudstone is a convenient term recently introduced to designate an earthy, clayey rock, void of shaly lamination ; evidently consolidated mud, whether of aqueous or of volcanic origin. Slate is often applied indiscriminately to all hard, laminated, argillaceous rocks that can be readily split up. The term, however, should be restricted to those in which the clayey particles predominate, and the consolidation is so per fect that the mass assumes a semi-crystalline aspect like ordinary roofing-slate.APPENDIX 14.

The Irrigation Party consisted of one senior Executive Engineer, one Supervisor, one Zilladar and four Sub-overseers, of the Public Works Depart ment, with 22 Punjabi khalassies and four Sutlej boatmen. The Executive Engineer was paid 40 per cent, deputation allowance, the subordinates 20 per cent, and Baluchistan allowance. The khalassies and boatmen received Rs. 14 per month pay and the travelling allowances of a chaprassi. The survey instruments were received from and returned again to the Mathematical Instrument Office, Calcutta, except those noted at the bottom of the first page of Chapter VIII which were left at the Consulate in Seistan. The sum debited to the Mission for depreciation for instruments and tents used by the party is not known, but Rs. 1,475 has been allowed for this. Mr. W. Nicol Gumming, the Superintendent of the British Commissioner’s Office, has kindly extracted the expenditure debited to the party in the Mission accounts; this is given in the statement at the end of this Appendix. The expenditure incurred in Simla in writing tip the Mission notes and this report has been added in a separate column. The party formed an integral part of the Mission and there are many Mission expenses, a share of fahieh should be debited to this account; for instance^ some part of the British Commissioner’s pay and that of his office as the cost of direction and accounts, various expenses on account of transport, supplies, etc., So that it may be considered that the party cost about Rs. 1,77,000, perhaps 5 per cent, of the gross cost of the Mission.
