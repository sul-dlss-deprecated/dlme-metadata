WHITEHALL, S.VV. 1, 13th September 1922, Sir, With reference to the last paragraph of this Ofiice letter No. P. 1279 of 13th April last, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward, for the consideration of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, a copy of the correspondeuce 1 noted in the margin regarding the proposed amend ment of those articles of the Treaty of Sevres which have been represented as interfering with the ' spiritual The points in dispute are clearly set out in the correspondence, and Viscount Peel does not think it necessary to recapitulate them. He will content himself with stating again the principles which in his opinion must be observed in drafting a formula to implement the pledge given by the Prime Minister to the Indian Moslems in March 1921, viz., that (1) while no obligation can be imposed upon the rulers of the separated territories which is inconsistent with the degree of independence attributed to them by the Covenant of the League of Nations, or which the Mandatory Powers cannot in practice enforce, nothing must be inserted in the treaty which would prevent the Turks from concluding with these rulers any arrangements that may be reciprocally agreed upon with regard to the recognition of the Sultan as Caliph in their territories and any consequences that may legitimately flow therefrom. These are matters for Moslems, with which the non-Moslem Powers have nothing to do ; (2) no language should be used in the treaty which, owing to its ambiguity or to other reasons, can on the one hand be made the basis for further political claims in behalf of Turkey, or on the other hand lay His Majesty's Government open to the charge of breach of faith. The Secretary of State for India is advised that the term ' spiritual rights ' is inconsistent with both these principles, and that though the term ' spiritual privileges ' is not altogether free from ambiguity—since the word ' spiritual,' as opposed to ' temporal,' has no precise equivalent in Arabic it can be used without danger provided that it is clearly understood that it will be interpreted strictly in the western sense with which we are familiar in the history of the Papacy. The final proposals, therefore, which Viscount Peel makes for the consideration of the Marquess Curzon of Kedleston are (a) that Article 139 of the Treaty of Sevres should be amended to run as follows ' The Turkish Government renounces formally all political rights or jurisdiction of any kind over Moslems who are subject to the sovereignty or protectorate of any other State. 'No power shall be exercised directly or indirectly by any Turkish political authority whatever in any territory detached from Turkey or of which the existing status under the present Treaty is recognised by the Turkish Government.' 5708 30 9.22 Telegrams to Government of India, 1226, 21st March; from ditto, 381 S., 27th March ; to ditto, 1542, 13th April; from ditto. 498 S., 22nd April; to ditto, 17-47, 4th May ; from ditto, 571 S., 9th May.

(c) In their telegram of 24th July the Government of India raise the question whether there is any distinction of meaning in the Treaty of Sevres between the terms 'Turkish Government' and 'Turkey.' It seems possible that the latter was intended to include, and the former to exclude, the Sultan; but Lord Peel is unable to recognise any clear principle governing their use, and he is inclined to agree with the Government of India that it is preferable to use ' Turkish Government' wherever it is desired to express anything but a purely geographical conception. (d) The Government of India also propose in Article 100 to substitute 'ports' for 'territories,' to which Lord Peel sees no objection; and (e) to cancel Article 121. (lis Lordship is not quite clear what are the precise rights and privileges iu Libya which were left to the Sultan by the Ireaty ol Lausanne of 18th October 1912, but he assumes that they include those specified in the Ireaty of 15th October 1912, to which that of the JSth October was an annexe. The matter is primarily for the Italian Government; but the Moslem deputation to the Prime Minister appeared to attach importance to the retention of these rights and privileges, and Lord Peel would be glad ii. His Majesty's Government could use their good otiices to that end. Lord Curzon will observe that the drafts proposed under heads (a) and (b) are the result of much anxious consideration, and Lord Peel trusts that they may be accepted.

ENCLOSURE Xo. 1:— Telegram from Secretary of State to 'Viceroy, 2lst March 1022. 1220. Colonial (Mice have pointed out that Article 132 of Treaty of Sevres leaves le^al status of Arabia except Hedjaz undefined pending an agreement between Principal Allied Powers, and that prospects of conclusion of such an agreement as was contemplated at time of signing of treaty are now doubtful. Colonial Office therefore recommended that while Kamaran should .perhaps be placed under British suzerainty, independence of Arabian Peninsula should be recognised in the treaty, leaving His Majesty's Government to rely on their international position for predominance, and that all reference to a future agreement should be omitted. Foreign Office in reply state they are prepared, while retaining Article 132 of the treaty, to endeavour to secure insertion of an Article on the following lines :— ' Turkey hereby renounces in favour of the independent Arab rulers concerned all rights and title which she could claim on any ground over or concerning anj- territories in the Arabian Peninsula which are not otherwise disposed of in the present treaty.' As regards Kamaran, Foreign Office are reluctant to invite counter-claims and controversy by proposing any new provision giving special advantage to His Majesty's Government and suggest that existing position of His Majesty's Government will probably remain unchallenged if no specific mention is made of Kamaran in revised treaty. Do you wish to offer any observations ? Please reply as quickly as possible. ENCLOSURE No. 2 :— Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State, '21th March 1022. 38.1 S. Your telegram of the 21st March, 1226. We are not clear as to the implications of the Colonial Office suggestion that Kamaran should be placed under iiritish suzerainty. But if the idea is that it should be treated as part of Hedjaz, we are definitely opposed to it, for British suzerainty over any part of Hedjaz would be open to the strongest, possible objection. Politically and strategically, the arguments in favour of our continued occupation rest presumably, not on value of Kamaran to ourselves, but ou the necessity of keeping Italy or other Power out. Would inter national control bo open to serious objection ? From quarantine point of view there would clearly be advantage in transferring it, say, to Health Section of League of Nations in view of international character of pilgrimage, cost involved over necessary (? improvements) and possible odium attaching to collection of dues, if such transference is otherwise unobjectionable and could be arranged, it would seem well to provide for it in the treaty. If not, we agree with Foreign Office as to tactics. We agree also with their general formula provided that Turkish renunciation is confined specifically to ' temporal ' rights or some such phraseology. What Ave are anxious for is that the language used should not stultify our recommendation regarding the suzerainty of the J loly Places, or seem incompatible with the declaration that the Khilafat question is one for Moslems themselves to decide. For the same reasons we urge insertion of u temporal' in Article 98. ENCLOSURE No. 3:— Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, loth April 1922. 1542. Your telegram of 27th March, 381. With a view to revision of Treaty of Sevres, it seems necessary to define precisely what is meant by Sultan's religious suzerainty over Holy Places. 1 am not aware of your interpretation of term suzerainty in this connection and should be glad to receive it. Also to know whether Indian Moslems limit suzerainty to Holy Places or whether that limitation represents all that you are prepared to support. Particular amendment suggested in your telegram above quoted would apparently have effect of imposing on independent rulers irrespective of their assent whatever spiritual authority was previously exercised by Sultan, and as explained by my predecessor in his telegram of 0th March, this is not possible. When we know exactly what we want to secure, best means of securing it would perhaps be clause to effect that nothing in this treaty shall prevent Turkish Government from arranging it with rulers concerned. I should like your views on this also.ENCLOSURE No. 4 i—Telcgram from Viceroy to Secretary of State, 22nd April 1922, 498 S. Your telegram of the 13th April, 1542. Indian Moslem opinion, though becoming reconciled to fact that Arab portions of old Turkish Empire must remain autonomous, would like to see Turkish suzerainty restored over them in some visible shape, however shadowy in substance. We ourselves, however, realise that, in view of our war pledges, the Saltan's territorial suzerainty is now out of the question, except with the assent of Arab rulers themselves. But il; Turkey's integrity is adequately safeguarded in Anatolia and Thrace under tbe revised treafcv, we believe Indian Moslem majority would accept position, and that extremist majority would in time become reconciled thereto, always provided that the Sultan Caliph's religious suzerainty over the Holy Places is formally recognised. Indian Moslems, no doubt, desire formal recognition of such religious suzerainty to extend over all those Holy Places which constitute centre of Moslem pilgrimage from all parts of the world. We ourselves, however, realise diificulties this would involve, and believe that, with the Sultan's religious suzerainty formally recognised over Mecca and Medina, sober Indian Moslems will be appeased and ultimately carry rest with them. Opinions would differ widely, of course, as to extent of outward recognition this would entail. But it should certainly include such outward symbols as the restoration of all ancient religious ceremonials, like Kiswah and Mahmal, and formal confirmation by the Sultan Caliph, by virtue of his spiritual authority, of Arab rulers on their succession as hereditary guardians and managers of Holy Places. Indian Moslem opinion would also desire that Caliph should be entitled, if he so wished, to the presence of his representative, with the right to fly his Hag, at the Holy Places themselves, though we ourselves recognise that there may be difiiculties in acceding to this view. Nor would this solution of the problem involve active imposition on the independent rulers, irrespective of their assent, of whatever spiritual authority was previously exercised by the Sultan. Amendment in treaty by the use of the term 'temporal' we suggested, and still suggest, in this respect is negative, not positive, in character. Its effect would be simply the recognition of the non-removal of a spiritual authority which, in the minds of vast number of pious Moslems, must continue to exist until Islam itself decides otherwise. Of the territorial and spiritual authority exercised by the Sultan before the war. Allied Powers are divesting him of the former. But there is nothing in international jurisprudence or equity to prevent them saying that grant of territorial independence to the Arab principalities does not affect position of Sultan as Caliph of Islam, and, as such, religious suzerain over the Holy Places. Indeed, were this not so, our affirmation that Caliphate is a question for Islam, and Islam only, would be of no effect. Nothing will shake Indian Moslems in their con viction that there can be no difficulty in obtaining acquiescence of the Arab rulers in this recognition of the actual facts, provided that Great Britain, whom they regard as the real author of Arab independence and the head and front of the Allied Powers, is so minded. On the other hand, the formula you suggest implies that the Caliph's spiritual authority has actually been removed, but may possibly hereafter be restored by arrangement between Arab rulers and the Caliph. This would, we fear, arouse the susceptibilities of the Indian Moslems. ENCLOSURE No. 5 :— Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, 4t/i May 1922. 1747. Your telegram of 22nd April, No. 498 S. It is important to be quite clear as to position. In earlier part of your telegram you seem to limit religious suzerainty to Hedjaz, whereas later you speak of Arab rulers plural. Argument about non- interruption of spiritual authority, though it might be applied to Grand Shereef of Mecca, who was Turkish nominee, .could not apply to Bin Sand, who required no Turkish recognition of his succession, nor to Kingdom of Iraq, which did not exist. Moreover, if successions are to require Turkish recognition, what would be position of signatories of treaty if Turks in a particular case refused to recognise ? Again, there is fundamental objection to attempt to distinguish between temporal and spiritual functions, since such distinction does not really exist, and attempt to foster belief in it was and is one of main planks in pan-Islamic platform. It is impossible to specify in treaty Sultan as Caliph, since that would involve pronouncement on Caliphate by non-Moslems. But 1 suggest a clause in following terms to follow clause proposed by Foreign Office: ' Nothing in this treaty shallbe held to interfere with the privileges assigned to the Caliph by the consensus of opinion in the Moslem world.' This formula leaves whole matter in Moslem hands, and would be interpreted by Turks and Arabs as they and other Moslems might agree between themselves. For consensus of opinion see section under that title in Abdur Rahim's Muhammadan Jurisprudence. Please telegraph vour views. ENCLOSURE No. G:— Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State, 9lh May 19i?2. 57 I S. Your telegram of the 4th May, 1747. We regret verbal inconsistency in our 498 S. It crept in owing to our feeling that, once Sultan's religious suzerainty is formally recognised over Mecca and Medina, it is only a matter of time for it to become extended insensibly over Baghdad. Bin Saud has no Holy Places under him. But though our specific argument was, and is, confined to Hedjaz, we deprecate any language in the treaty that would purport to restrict non-removal of Sultan's spiritual suzerainty to any particular area, for this would inflame Islam anew. Hence the general form in which we couched our suggestion that the Sultan's renunciation of temporal rights should apply to independent Arab rulers generally. In particular, it seems necessary to guard ourselves against anything that could be construed into exclusion of Baghdad. In theory, Nakib derived his title to the guardianship of the shrine from the Sultan, though, in practice. Sultan merely ratified the succession of the particular member of the Nakib family, who made good, by virtue of ordinary rules of inheritance, tempered by capacity. What is contemplated on death of present Nakib we do not know. But we feel that either Sultan should formally recognise de facto successor, or that, if Faisal is to do so, he should himself acquire the proper title by securing the Sultan's recognition of himself. His Majesty's Government will, we trust, recognise that this question to us is no mere academics, for Baghdad stands only behind Mecca and Medina in th e veneration of our frontier , trans-frontier 4^)/T^nd Afghanistan, and it is of great moment to India that there' ' r *$ 0&lt;rn should be no defect in the title of the next Nakib. Remarks will serve to clear up what we meant by Sultan's recognition of an Arab ruler on his succession. We mean simplv Sultan's formal recognition of de facto successor qua his guardianship of Holy Places. Once this becomes fait accompli we apprehend little prospect of conflict or deadlock. But, should non- recognition occur, it would be a questio n beyond the provinpp nl' non -Moslem Po wers, / / / to be decided by Moslem iii.uul.ik the light of Moslem public opinion. We are not sure whether we correctly follow your argument about distinction between temporal and spiritual functions, for we find it hard to reconcile it both with past history and pan-Islamic movement. But whatever the pan-Islamic argument or the answer to the historical question of fact, is not recognition of such distinctions forced upon ourselves, seeing that we are breaking the Sultan's temporal power and yet proclaiming that Khilafat is question with which non-Moslems have no concern? Pith of our contention is that the treaty should be scrupulously confined to temporalities, and should avoid any interference, real or apparent, with the Caliph of Islam. (? Hence) the slight verbal amendment in the treaty suggested in our telegram 381 S. We regret to have to deprecate additional clause now proposed by Foreign Office' ::: '. To suggest thai the doctine of consensus of opinion applies would be to suggest that there is some important problem to be solved. But for centuries Xhilafat has descended to the Sultan by inheritance, and question has therefore been, and on Sultan's death will be, decided by doctrine of custom (vide Abdur Rahim page 130).

See enclosure No. 6. 57086 Annex -.-Minute hy Sir Muhammad Shaft, K.C.S.L, C.LH. The Caliph's Ueligious Position. In the telegram from His Majesty's Secretary of State for India to His Excellencj^ the Viceroy, No. 1747, dated the 4th instant, there are some misconceptions regarding the Muslim institution of Khilafat which it is essential should be cleared up. The following facts are beyond all dispute (see Sir William Muir's ' Caliphate,. Its Rise, Decline, and Fall,' and the Ivight lion. Syed Amir Ali's 'Short History of the Saracens '). The Prophet Mohammed having died sonless and without nominating his successor, Abu Bakr was elected as the iirst Caliph by the vote, not of the Muslims at large, but of the Companions of the Prophet. The second Caliph, Omar, •was nominated by Abu Bakr as his successor and succeeded to the Khilafat as a result of that nomination. The next three Caliphs, i.e., Osman, All and Hassan, were again enthroned as a result of election. On 30th July 6G1, Hassan, the last of these elected Caliphs, abdicated in favour of Muawiyah, the first of the Ommeyade Caliphs, who, during his lifetime, nominated his son Yezid as his successor. ' Henceforth, the ruling sovereign nominated his successor, whose reversion lie endeavoured to assure during his lifetime by the oath of fealty of his soldiers and grandees 11 (Amir Ali's ' History of the Saracens,' Chapter VII., page 83). Gradually, this nomination also fell into disuse, and succession to the Khilafat, except in the case of dynastic changes or abdication, has followed the ordinary rule of succession up to the present day. There are two important events in connection with succession to Khilafat, however, which, for the purposes of the questions raised in the Secretary of State's telegram, need special mention. After the murder by Holagu of Caliph Mustasim and his relatives in Baghdad (February 1258), Beibars, Sultan of Egypt, invited Mnstansir, the only surviving member of the Abbasside family, who was in hiding in Syria, to Cairo, and there Alustansir was proclaimed Caliph. From 1263 to loiN) A.I)., there followed a long line of Caliphs whose headquarters continued to be in Cairo. When Selim I. defeated the Mameluke Ruler oE Egypt, he brought away Caliph Mutwakkil to Constantinople in the year 1517. After a period of precarious existence in Constantinople, Mutwakkil resigned his rights as Caliph into the hands of Selim's successor Soleiman, and ever since then, during a period of some four centuries, Khilafat has descended from generation to generation in this family of the Sultans of Turkey according to the rule of succession. In his telegram the Secretary of State observes :—' Again there is a fundamental objection to attempting to distinguish between spiritual and temporal functions, since such distinction does not really exist, and attempt to foster belief in it was one of the main planks in pan-Islamic platforms.' The idea embodied in this passage is. if I may venture to say so, based on a misconception of Islamic history. From the time of Abu Bakr, the first Caliph, until the death of Merwan, the last Caliph of the House of Ommeya, in 750 A.I)., the Caliph was also the sovereign of Islam, and the entire territories in occupation of Muslims were ruled over by his A iceroys in various parts of the Muslim world. As sometimes happens when empires spread over vast areas, this position underwent a change with the rise of the Abbasides. The outlying territories in the vast Muslim Empire broke up into separate kingdoms, in so far as territorial sovereignty was concerned. But the spiritual authority of the Caliph as the religious head of Islam continued to be recognised even in all these independent Muslim kingdoms. The Khutba continued to be read in all mosques in the name of the Caliph ; and even independent Muslim sovereigns, on their accession, often obtained confirmation from the Caliph. Sultan Muhammad Ghaznavi, the first Muslim invader of India, ' received the title of Yaminal Daula, i.e., the right hand of the dynasty (of the Khalif) from the Caliph as a recognition of the legitimacy of his rule, resembling the investiture of the German Emperor by the Pope in the Middle Ages.' (See Dr. E. C. Sachaus ' Alberuni's India,' Volume 1., Preface, page xi.) And when the Caliphs possessed no territorial sovereignty of any kind and were merely the religious heads of Islam, with head- quarters at Cairo', during the three centuries already referred to, they enthroned the Sultan and the Khuiba was read in Muslim mosques in their names. It is noteworthy that even during this period, in the 8th century of the Hegira we find a deputation from Emperor Muhammed, son of Toghluk, waiting on the Caliph at Cairo with precious gifts for a patent of investiture from him. {Sec Sir William Muir's 'Caliphate,' Chapter LXXVHI., pages 592-3.) These are only two of the many instances which could be cited to prove that whatever the position of the Caliph with reference to rights of territorial sovereignty, his exercise of religious7 authority as the head of the Muslim Church has continued throughout the period of Muslim history. It is obvious that so far as the outlying independent Muslim kingdoms were concerned, the separation between (he territorial sovereignty and religious authority of the Caliph quel those territories took place from the date when the rulers of these outlying tracts ceased to be viceroys of the Caliph. Moreover, this brief survey of history regarding the Khilafat makes it clear that during some three centuries there was an absolute separation between the religious authority of the Caliph and territorial sovereignty, for during that period the Caliph ceased to be the ruler of any part of the Muslim world. In other words, with the disintegration of the Muslim Empire, w hile the territorial sovereignty of the Caliph continued to shrink in proportion to the territories directly under his sway, his spiritual authority or suzerainty as the Caliph of Islam continued to be recognised all over the Muslim world, it is for this reason that tlie Khutba has always been read in the name of the Caliph in all mosques in all countries, no matter who may be their territorial sovereign. Sultan Caliph's territorial authority, therefore, may be cut down as a result of the proposed treaty in respect of the liberated Arab territories; but this cannot affect his spiritual authority as the Caliph of Islam over these tracts. It is for this very reason that even when King Husain declared the independence of the Hedjaz from the Turkish rule and was actually at war with the Turks, Khutha used to be read as before, in the name of the Sultan Caliph even in his (llusain's) own mosque at Mecca. In the new formula suggested by the Secretary of State, the underlying idea is assignment to Caliph by consensus of opinion in the Muslim world of certain privileges. This again is, I venture to think, based on a misapprehension. The authority of Sir Abdur Rahim, cited towards the end of the telegram in support of this position, has no application whatever to this case. In the passage in question, that learned author, in speaking of cases where there is no express rule in the Muslim Code or precedent in Muslim history governing a particular case which may arise for decision ; or, to quote his own words, where the Muolim community are ' left to their own resources' and are 'called upon to solve ' an important problem. As a case in point, he cites the election of Abu Bakr as the iirst Caliph. As I have already observed, the Holy Prophet had himself died sonless and had not nominated his successor, and, in consequence, solution of the problem of succession to him was rightly had by application of the principle of ' Ijma ' or consensus of opinion, be it noted in that case, not of the whole Muslim world, but of ' the Companions of the Prophet.' In the present case no such contingency has arisen or can arise, requiring a decision by consensus oi; opinion. For centuries past the Khilafat has descended to the Sultan of Turkey in accordance with the rule of succession, and the present Sultan became the lawful Caliph of Islam on his acccession to the throne. Neither the war nor the fact that portions of the pre-war Turkish Empire have now become territorially independent can all'ect the continued maintenance of his spirtual authority as the Caliph of Islam. That remains intact, and can come to an end only with his death or abdication and the succession of another to him as Sultan Caliph (see Sir Abdur Kahim's work, page 136, section II., ' Customs and Usages , ■). Moreover, the principle of 'Ijma ' or consensus of opinion may, in certain cases, be applicable to the election of a new Caliph. But it ea-n -have nothing whatever to do with the exercise by the Caliph of his authority as the Religious Head or Suzerain of Islam when once he has become the Caliph whether by succession or election or otherwise. To the exercise of that authority and of the privileges attached to his position as the Viceregent of the Prophet, he is entitled so long as he retains his position as Caliph. Md. Siiafi , Barrister-at-Law, 13th May 1922. Member for Education and Health. ENCLOSURE No. 8 :— Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, 25t1i May 19^2. Your telegram dated the 9th May, 571 S. As regards immediate question of amendment of Treaty of Sevres, I understand that you agree that there is no question of including in treaty any positive provision for maintenance of Sultan's religious suzerainty and for any other details in connection with Caliphate. It is necessary to know what maintenance of religious suzerainty is intended to mean in practice, but question what action, if any, can be taken (consistently with principle that Khilafat question is one for Moslems alone) to bring about detailed arrangements at Holy Places indicated in your telegrams dated the 22nd April and 9th May will remain for further consideration apart from terms of treaty. Immediate question is how to give 5708 Ceffect to Prime Minister's promise that it will he made perfectly clear in final settle ment with Turkey that there is no intention to interfere with spiritual power of Caliph. Ion adhere, as I understand, to your proposal that word 4 ' temporal, 11 or some similar expression, should be inserted in proposed clause quoted in my telegram dated the iMst March, No. 1226, and in Article ( .)S (and also, 1 presume, in Articles 132 and 139). Setting aside objection to drawing in this connection distinction between 45 temporal ' and ' spiritual,' this proposal seems to me open to serious objection that its adoption would imply that ' Turkey,' as such, has some powers or rights other than temporal. Even if ' Turkey ' be read to mean the Sultan of Turkey ' it would imply identiiication of Sultan with Caliph, and a particular view of attributes of latter. Also it would clearly imply in some degree maintenance' of a spiritual authority irrespective of views of Arab rulers concerned. For these reasons it seems to me much preferable if suitable wording can be found to add to treaty a general saving clause negative in form and neither expressing nor implying any view as to existing position or attributes of Caliphate. Formula proposed in my telegram dated the 4th May, No. 17-17, was drafted with this object, and I do not at present feel that your objection to it is decisive. Nor do 1 altogether understand it since formula refers to privileges assigned to Caliph and says nothing about transmission of Caliphate. Ihit perhaps you can suggest a better formula on the same lines. Please telegraph your further views. ENCLOSURE No. 9;— Telegram from. Viceroy to Secretary of State, 7l]i June 1922. 750 S. Your telegram of the 25th May, No. 2019. Khilafat. We agree with your telegram down to the words ' intention to interfere with spiritual power of the Caliph.' We further admit the force of your contention that spiritual power which it is desired to conserve is that of the Sultan Caliph and not of Turkey, but wo find some difficulty in reconciling your expressed desire for conserving that power with your implied reluctance to accept identification of Sultan with Caliph. We agree that such identification should not be specifically mentioned in the treaty, but to us it is none the less a fact beyond challenge. Throughout Moslem India and Central Asia, at any rate, there is no Khilafat question in the sense ' Who is the Caliph? ' and sole point at issue is the reconciliation of the Treaty of Sevres with Great Britain's promise(s) regarding Caliphate which is vested in the Sultan of Turkey. But so long as non-interference with the spiritual power of the Caliph is, in accordance with the Prime Minister's promise(s), clearly enunciated in the treaty by the insertion of a general saving clause, we now agree that inclusion of word ' temporal ' in Articles 92 and 132 is unnecessary, and indeed, on your showing, hardly tenable. But our objections to the Foreign Office draft 0 remain unchanged, and we would prefer wording somewhat on these lines 'Nothing in this Treaty purports to affect, or shall be held to affect, spiritual authority of Caliph.' VTe have throughout assumed that Article 139 would disappear automatically on the revisi on of the treaty as being directed mainly, if not wholly, against the religious suzerainty of Sultan C^ntiphj ifannmj t &lt;rr,u,p) which has been the cardinal point we have consistently advocated. If it is to be maintained, utmost care will be required to ensure that its wording does not in any way conflict with or impair essential force of general saving clause, and thus stultify our main contention and neutralise any advantage that we might otherwise acquire with Moslems over our preservation of the Caliph's spiritual authority. Would it not be best to omit it altogether? ENCLOSI RE No. 10:— Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroii, Wth July 1922. Your telegram dated the 7th June, 750. What is required is a formula which will (1) fulfil the Prime Minister's pledge and be acceptable to Indian Moslems; (2) not be capable of being made the basis of political claims under the cloak of religion ; (3) not impose on the new Arab States any requirement to which they might reasonably object and which His Majesty's Government as mandatory might be called upon to enforce. As a result of further very careful consideration here 1 suggest that general saving clause might run : — ' Nothing in this treaty purports to affect or shall be held to affect any spiritual privileges assigned to the Caliph by the tenets of the Moslem religion.' This might * See footnote on page 5.9 follow Article 139, which might be modified by substituting 'The Turkish Govern ment renounces formally all political rights ' for lirst seven words and by inserting 'political' between ' Turkish' and 'authority.' The two articles are intended to be complementary, and I should deprecate the former without the latter. I hope you will accept these formulae.

Tenet by itself is inadequate, since such religious ceremonies as the Kiswah and Mahmal, which Moslems desire to see restored {vide our telegram No. 498), are matters ot' immemorial usage, not ol tenet; wording we recommend therefore is ' any spiritual rights and privileges assigned to the Caliphs by the tenets or usage ot' the Moslem religion.' With the incorporation of this general clause is / , there still any serious objection to the insertion of 'political' W temporal ' in ■ Articles 98 and 132? Combined eltect of these changes would, we believe, satisfy Moslem sentiment all over the world that the Khilafat was sufficiently protected. So vital is the general clause that we urge it should be given all possible prominence. This might perhaps best be secured by placing the general provisions headed by this article in the forefront of Part 3 of the treaty. The nearer the general clause stands to the Iledjaz section the better, and the order of articles might, with advantage, be reshuffled accordingly. \\ e accept your re-draft of the opening words of Article 139. Does it not render superfluous retention of the words 'or jurisdiction of any kind ' ? We are not clear on what principle the terms ' Turkey ' and ' Turkish Government ' -are employed in the treat}*. If they are meant to be synonymous, we suggest that the latter be used throughout. In any case we press that it should be used in the re-draft of Article 132 and also in Article 98. As regards Article 121, we obviously cannot endorse the renunciation of ' rights and privileges' secured to the Sultan in Libya under the Treaty of Lausanne, seeing that it is precisely 'rights and privileges' of this nature that we desire to see safeguarded generally, nor can we imagine the Italian Government will now take a different view. As regards other articles, we have nothing further to urge in connection with maintenance of Sultan Caliph's position. As regards territorial changes to be made in the treaty, we abide, of course, by our telegram of the 28th February, No. 266 S. In Article 100 we recommend 'territory' be altered to 'ports,' not merely to bring the treaty into consonance with the facts, but to avoid all possible loopholes for misrepresentation that King Hussain is being forced to open Hedjaz to non-Moslems at dictation of non-Moslem Powers. ENCLOSURE No. 12 :— Telegram from Secretary of Stateto Viceroy, \2tli August 1922. 3125. Your telegram dated the 24th July, 967 S. As regards general saving clause, one difficulty 1 feel i.-. that French and English terms when translated into Arabic or Urdu may connote something quite different. Canyon tell me how terms ' spiritual rights' and 'spiritual authority' would be translated, and what they would mean to a Moslem as translated? If, as I am led to believe, nearest equivalents in Arabic or Urdu are terms which would necessarily import the whole mechanism of the Islamic State we are at once up against the difficulty that the use of such terms may form the basis of fresh political claims in the future, which has notoriously been the reason why the pan-Islamic party have tried to insist on them in the past. It would also be convenient to know what are the rights or authority which would thus be preserved to the Caliph. For example, do you contemplate that the Sultan of Turkey while Caliph should appoint the Kazis in independent Arab States ?10 ENCLOSURE Xo. 13 Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State, 23rd August 1922.. 1060. Your telegram of the 13th August last, 3125. We recognise the difficulty of finding suitable Arabic equivalent for ' spiritual authority, and theiefoie leveit to our alternative suggestion of ''spiritual rights and privileges, of vdiich substantives already occur in the treaty (Article 121). For this we suggest in Arabic 'al-huquqwal imtiyazat al diniyah.' The Urdu equivalent would be ' huquq wa imtivazat ruhani.' . We understand that these do not imply Islamic State mechanism. Definition of (Jaliph's rights and authority is a mattei foi Aloslems alone to determine, according to the usage and tenets of Islam. It would be most dangerous to attempt to' interfere in such a matter. All that isj incumbent on us is to ensuie that treaty is so worded as to make it clear that whicfe (sic ? it) extinguish©* bultan s territorial sovereignty in liberated territories, the Allies in no way aiiogating to themselves power to extinguish Caliph's spiritual rights and authority, which Islam alone can grant and take away. We have endeavoured to describe these latter m general terms in previous telegrams. Restoration of ceremonials is, perhaps, the most important factor in Muslim eyes. Appointment of Qazis does not ordinarily lie within Caliph's authority, but is a matter for the actual temporal rulers. ENCLOSURE No. 1-1 -.—Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, 1st September 1922. 3404. Your telegram of 23rd August, 1000. I am most anxious to meet the views of the Indian Moslems, but we must be very careful in using terms which have different connotations in East and West. I am advised that Arabic expression u al-huquq,' &amp;c., must to a Moslem connote all those well-recognised forms of authority which are assigned to the Caliph by Moslem law. It is true that many of these have lapsed in India and are not familiar to the majority of Indian Moslems, but this is not so elsewhere, e.g., right of Sheikh-ul-ltlmat to appoint Kazis is recognised by treaty of Lausanne, which you wish to restore. But point is, that authority exercised by Caliph as head of Moslem community cannot be differentiated into political and spiritual as those terms are understood in the West, but if the spiritual is admitted it necessarily carries with it in Moslem eyes the political as well, and your formula, instead of extinguishing the Sultan's territorial sovereignty in liberated territories, actually has the effect of re-affirming it. This being so, we must avoid use of language which may give rise on the one hand to new political claims and on the other to charge of breach of faith. For this reason I feel that expression 'spiritual privileges,' suggested in my telegram of 11th July, is only safe one, as leaving it to Moslems themselves to settle in the light of existing conditions in independent Arab States exactly what are privileges which Caliph should enjoy. I am accordingly addressing the Foreign Office in this sense.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00036e_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/B372</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00036e</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/B372</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Letter from Sir Frederic Aarthur Hirtzel, India Office, to the Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office, dated 13 Sep 1922</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1922/1922</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-09-19T09:24:23</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (5 folios)</extent><extent>Foliation: The foliation sequence commences at the front cover, and terminates at the inside back cover; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.Pagination: The volume also contains an original printed pagination sequence.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This secret printed memorandum is a copy of a letter from Sir Frederic Arthur Hirtzel, India Office, to the Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office, dated 13 Sep 1922, concerning the proposed amendment of the articles of the Treaty of Sévres which have been represented as interfering with the 'spiritual power' of the Caliph.
