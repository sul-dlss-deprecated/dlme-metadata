V\ Vv-, ^Vv ^ Ur. ** w/l ^ .-m llkf* * .JLjl0 FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 12th May, 1943 I promised to let you have some material to help you in preparing an answer to the Viceroy*s telegram 1111 S of May 6th. In the first place, I find that the vast majority or telegrams from Tehran on the major political issues were only repeated to the Qovernment of India Saving. We rather naturally followed the same policy with our replies. But as it takes a good deal longer for a telegram sent Saving to reach Delhi from here than it does from Tehran, the Government of India have no doubt got the impression that we have not been repeating our telegrams to them. I do not quite see how we can get over this difficulty, for if we repeated direct to the Government of India all our .--wlii |^ e l e S r&gt;ams 'to Tehran on political questions our answers - ? might in some cases rea ch Delhi before the original telegrans . (from Tehran. However, we will do our best to remember that any important telegrams we may send (there are not many or them) should be repeated to Delhi direct. Paragraph 1 of this telegram seems a fair enough esti mate of the situation. We are not happy about either,as will be seen from some of our telegrams. As regards paragraph 3(a), one of the chief reasons why anti-British and anti-American activities are allowed to flourish by the Persian Government is that the Persians are terrified of the Russians but at the same time dare not criticise them. As a result, we (and now to an increasing E.W.R. Lumby Jisq., extent/ India Office.extent the Americans also) receive the full benefit of their indignation. We are doing our best to tackle this problem, but it is not easy. ^ I rather doubt if there is much in the risk (suggested in paragraph 3(b)) of a German-inspired rising as an resu lt of the German failure in the Caucasus, We have/fleard that the organisation involved in the Mayr plot has been active again. As for co-operation with the Russians (paragraph 3(c)) I am not sure what the Government of India mean by the word M frankly’ , . We have repeatedly impressed on the Russians how important it is for them to co-operate with us in matters affecting the general Allied interest in Persia. We shall, no doubt, do so again, but the occasion must be carefully cnosen; and we must realise that we are noi in a position to threaten any reduction in the volume of our supplies to Russia as a result of Russian failure to co-operate with us. After all, we are sending supplies to Russia through Persia in our own interest as well as that of the Kussians. As for paragraph 3(d), recent communications snow that the scales are now falling from the Americans' eyes. They went into Persia with a number of illusions, but in the last month or two they have begun to realise that the Persians are better at promising than performing, while the Persians, for their part, find that the Americans expect them to make an effort to put their own house in order/ This mutual disenchantment has had a salutary effect on the whole. It is in part at least due to the efforts we have made to put the truth across, but we fear that many illusions still per sist about Persia in the State Department.' . In general I think we must face the fact that we shall inevitably remain unpopular in Persia so long as we are obliged to upset the organisation of the country by our vast military expenditure (wnich helps to bring about inflation) and by using the railway and the roads for sending supplies to Russia (wnich disorganises the transport of foodstuffs and civil supplies.) So long as our Legation is obliged to take the lead in putting pressure on the Persian Government in all matters affecting the general Allied interest we shall remain unpopular. It is probably true that the average educated Persian fears the Russians much more than he does us. But at the moment the Russians come in for less than their fair share of criticism, firstly because the Persians are afraid of them, and secondly because they stay in their zone and leave us to take the lead both in transporting supplies to them and in helping to feed the Persian people. As a result the Persians blame us for transporting goods to Russia instead of blaming the Russians to whom they are sent. I fear this is only a superficial commentary on some of the main points at issue, but I hope it may give some assistance to you in answering the Government of India’s enquiries.

HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith a copy of Intelligence Summary No. 14. for the period the 31st March to the 6th April, compiled by the military attache to this legation. Tehran, April 6, 1943. Enclosure. (Secret.) Military Attache s Intelligence Summary No. 14 for the Period March 31 to April 6. 1943. Persian Affairs. Political. THE atmosphere is disturbed. The Government has shown no firmness in dealing with the agitator or with a very subversive press, although a few of the worst papers have been suppressed. The discontent of the lower classes is being fanned; the Tudeh party continues to acquire adherents; and there is anxiety lest the agitation should lead to strikes and sabotage by workers and peasants. New political parties are springing up, usually claiming to represent youth and the working classes, and the Government has felt obliged to authorise the Military Governor to prohibit all political meetings in Tehran. Criticism of the British in the press and in popular talk continues; and a rather bitter attack was made in the Majlis, which was. however, well answered by Tadayyun, the Minister of Food. 2. There is reported to he a split in the Tudeh party, one section following the original founder, Abbas Iskandari, and dissentients being led by his son. Iraj Iskandari, and Suleiman Mirza. The latter section is said to object to the inclusion in the party programme of a statement to the effect that the party is national and has as one of its objects the preservation of the independence of Persia. 3. The Queen Mother and the Princess Shams (sister of the Shah) have returned from their visit to Egypt. Economic. 4. Dr. Millspaugh s first monthly report is of interest. In a review of Persian economy in recent years he notes the decline of agriculture, the excessive urbanisation, the lack of progress in hygiene, the extravagant growth of administrative organisations resulting in a spendthrift expenditure, and the gradual demoralisation of character that resulted from all power and initiative being in the hands of a few. On the other hand, he gives credit for the construction of railways and roads, the development of commerce and the foundation of national industries. In commenting on the rise in the cost of living he points out that it is due only in part to the inflation caused by the heavy expenditure of the Allies in rials; it is also due to unbalanced budgets, which necessitated heavy borrowings by the Government from the National Bank; to the weakness of the Government, which, on the one hand, occasioned a lack of confidence in the cover for the note issue, and, on the other, took no adequate measures for the stabilisation of prices; and to speculation and hoarding. The indebtedness of the Government in January 1943 was 3.400 million rials, whereas in March 1942 it had been less than 2J million. The revenue during the first nine months of the Persian year 1321 (the 21st March, 1942-20th March. 1943) showed a decrease of 672 million rials in comparison with the same period of [41-8] ^ - ' !'2 the previous year, while for the same periods expenditure showed an increase of 590 million rials. The measures which he proposed to advise as remedies were:— (a) Stabilisation of prices and rationing of necessities of life. (b) Revision of taxes with a view to withdrawing paper currency from circulation and reducing the deficit in the budget. (c) Reduction of national expenditure and cessation of borrowing from the National Bank. (d) Development of agriculture and industry. (e) Increase of imports as far as transport would allow. (/) The more equitable distribution of imported goods. (g) Sale of the State lands. (h) Importation of gold. (/) Sale of metal coin against paper money. 5. The bread situation in Tehran has eased. Supplies of imported grain are reaching the town, as are also supplies from the provinces, as a result of improved transport conditions and the offer of higher prices by the Government. The Food Department has now some four-five days’ reserves in hand. Items, of Interest. 6. Typhus, which is endemic in Tehran, has now become epidemic on a serious scale. No accurate figure of the number of cases is obtainable, but it is estimated at from 15,000 to 30,000. The Persian Government finds itself short of hospital accommodation and equipment, and improvised hospitals are being set up in various Government and Royal buildings, and the Majlis has sanctioned a credit of 5 million rials for necessary expenses. The Commander-in-chief, Persia and Iraq Force, has authorised the use of an Indian General Hospital for Persian typhus patients. There are less serious epidemics at Kerman, Zahidan, Meshed and other towns of Persia. 7. An aircraft of the Persian Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs, flying on the regular mail service from Bagdad to Tehran, crash-landed between Khanakin and Kermanshah. Two of the occupants were killed and three wounded. A appointments — Civil. 8. —(i) Dr. Muhammad Sajjidi (F.O. 183), to be Director of the Mortgage Bank.

Internal Security. Western Azerbaijan. 9. His Majesty's Vice-Consul in Tabriz, who recently toured in Western Azerbaijan, reports that there is considerable anxiety.lest the Kurds should this spring repeat their depredations of last year. They are buying arms wherever they can with the large profits made from the sale of grain in Iraq and on the black market in Persia. They oppose the establishment of posts of-Persian gendarmerie in tribal territory, but in some cases have been forced by Russian pressure to agree. They have been raiding across the Turkish frontier and in one raid carried off 2.000 sheep, of which 200 were recovered and returned by the Russians. His Majesty’s Vice-Consul is of opinion that, if the Russians make plain their disapproval of Kurdish lawlessness, serious disorder this spring need not be feared. Fars. 10. The situation remains quiet and no information has yet been received that General Shahbakhti has yet made any effective move against Nasir Qashgai. The nature of the problem has already changed with the arrival of spring. Those Persians who favour strong measures against Nasir are now being accused of being unpatriotic pawns of British policy. Bakhtiari. 11. A report has been received that Abul Qasim and his followers have forced the evacuation of a Persian military post at Izeh (Malamir). The delay in dealing with the situation in Fars is having a bad effect on the tribal situation everywhere in South Persia.Russian Affairs. 1*2 A Russian officer in Meshed stated to His Majesty's Vice-Consul that some Spitfire aircraft had arrived in Meshed in February for the training of Russian pilots. 13. A note on Soviet influence in Persia is attached to this summary. 14. His Majesty’s Vice-Consul in Tabriz recently visited Western Azerbaijan and gained the impression that the Russians were now regretting the encouragement they had given to the Kurds in the early days of their occupation. They were now appreciating the necessity for settled conditions in Western Azerbaijan and for the maximum production of food-stuffs. They were not, however, willing to allow the Persian Government to maintain adequate forces in that area for the maintenance of order and limited even the size of posts. But they were using their moral influence to assist the Persians to keep the Kurds in order, and on more than one occasion they had demonstrated their support of the Persian authorities by sending Russian officers to accompany Persian officers to insist on the Kurds complying with Persian demands. They are suspicious of any indication of British influence among the Kurds of Western Azerbaijan, and the suggestion that a man is a British agent is enough to ensure his arrest. A merican Interests. 15. An Irano-American Society has been formed for the encouragement of social relations. The president is Hassan Isfandiari, the President of the Majlis, and the vice-president is the American Minister. Polish Affairs. 16. The number of civilian Polish refugees still in Persia is : — In Tehran : 10.971 men, women and children. Isfahan : 1.911 men. women and children. Ahwaz : 3,971 men, women and children. Total : 16,853 men, women and children. Soviet Influence in Persia. 1. There has been recently a very noticeable change in the sentiments of the Persian people towards Russia. Closer contact with Russians and experience in Russian methods have already done much to modify the conception, hitherto popular among the masses, of Russia as a bogy and of Russians as brutal savages. The generally admirable discipline of Russian troops in Persia, their good behaviour towards the people, their professed sympathy with the lower classes, their advertised contentment with their own system, the good relations apparently existing between officers and men and the obviously magnificent morale of the Russian people have greatly affected preconceived ideas of the Soviet system. The Russians are at pains to bring to the notice of the Persian people their cultural activities. There are in Tehran two well-stocked Russian bookshops, where Russian classical and modern literature, technical hand books, newspapers and pamphlets can be obtained, and a permanent exhibition showing pictures of cultural interest, and having also a 1 ‘eading-room. Somewhat similar centres exist in Tabriz and Meshed. Russian films are also much in evidence in Tehran and provincial towns. An increasingly sympathetic interest is being shown in the principles of the Soviet system, and a courageous few even dare to advocate the adoption in Persia of some at least of its practice. This is the more noticeable in that communism is generally repugnant to the Persian people, both poor and rich. 2. The less frightful Russia is to the masses the more of a bogy does she become to the propertied classes. A situation seems to be developing where the masses may draw closer to Russia and the propertied classes come to be associated more closely than they now are with Great Britain. Indeed, Russia is already beginning to be regarded as the champion of the oppressed and is being looked to by the leaders of the discontented as a possible supporter of a revolution against the present ruling classes. The Russians, so the legend goes, have prevented the British removing food-stuffs from the provinces occupied by Russian troops; there the peasants have plenty; in those parts of Persia unfortunately deprived of Russian influence the poor are starving, while the British put large sums into the pockets of contractors, who exploit the worker and corner the people s food for sale to the British for consumption or export. That the Russians also consume and export considerable quantities of local produce has little effect on Persiansoutside the Russian zone, since there is alleged to be sufficient left for the people of their zone; and the fact that the usual surpluses from the Northern Provinces have not reached Tehran this year is blamed by the public more on the alleged British monopoly of civilian transport than on Russian obstructiveness. There is, however, reason to believe that the people living in the Russian zone are not so convinced of their good fortune as Russian propaganda would lead others to believe. 3. It would be unreasonable to suppose that the spread of these ideas is displeasing to the Russians or that they do not give them discreet encouragement. Whatever post-war objects the Russians have in view, it is unlikely that they will deliberately forgo the opportunity of paving the way for an increase of their political influence in Persia, even if it is only as a defensi defensive measure against the spread of British influence. That the Russians remain intensely suspicious of British (and American) designs in North Persia, and even possibly in the Caucasus, seems to be indicated by their recent request for an explanation of our construction of landing grounds in North and East Persia, by the increasing difficulty experienced in obtaining passes for British officers to visiti Azerbai jan, by their refusal to allow the Americans to operate convoys in the Russian zone and by the gradual extension southwards, although not as yet to any great extent, of their military posts. It might be unwise to interpret other Russian moves, such as the reopening of consulates in South and East Persia, their recon naissance of the Perso-Afghan frontier, their recent scientific expedition of investigation in South-West Persia, their opposition to the grant of authority to American advisers in Persian administrations, the contract for the manufacture of arms whereby Russia may acquire a partial control of certain factories and industries, the increasing interest they are taking in economic, political and tribal conditions in Central and South Persia, as steps in a far-reaching political plan; there are other reasonable explanations. But there is little doubt that the position of Russia in Persia after the war is likely to be considerably more advanced, much more closely in contact with important British interests, such as India, the Persian Gulf and the Anglo-Persian oil-fields, than before the war. 4. Conditions in Persia to-day are such that the masses will incline towards anyone who appears to sympathise with their sufferings; there is a growing dis content among the lower classes against the landowners and the masters of industry; the contrast between rich and poor is increasingly shameful; in most of the towns the conditions of the lower classes is appalling, lacking food, clothing, medicines and education; in many rural districts it is not much better. Russia is credited with sympathy for the masses; Great Britain is accused of callousness towards their sufferings. Persians have undoubtedly suffered from the Allies’ utilisation of the country's communications, from their large demands for currency and from their purchases of food-stuffs, and that being so it has not been difficult to persuade the mass of the people that all their ills are the effect of the actions of the Allies. But, somehow, Russia escapes much of the blame. Con ditions are relatively better in the Russian zone, which is. in any case, small compared with the rest of Persia, which sees only British and American control; it is Great Britain who restricts imports and controls the railway that should bring goods and oil from the Gulf; it is the U.K.C.C. who monopolises the civil transport in the greater part of Persia. It is the British Minister who has had to take the lead in bringing pressure on the Persian Government to satisfy Allied demands. 5. Great Britain is, consequently, probably more unpopular than she has ever been before. It would be unjustifiable to assume that Russia does not benefit from this unpopularity or that she fails to encourage comparisons unfavourable to Great Britain between the Russian and the British attitude towards the people. What is even more galling is that the behaviour of Russian troops in Persia should be contrasted favourably with that of British, and that in Tehran the British should have acquired a reputation for arrogance. Respect and awe of the Russians are increased by the fulsome praise of the British press. 6. Britain's unpopularity does not. however, prevent British influence from being very strong in Persia to-day. Britain is regarded by the majority of the middle and upper classes as the only real hope of post-war salvation. Some, at least, of them are conscious that the present economic distress is to some extent due to the inefficiency and corruption of the governing and propertied classes and are beginning to realise that the time has come when greater consideration must be shown to the condition of the masses.
