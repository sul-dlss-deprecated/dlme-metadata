Secret. S 'I-7 Bagdad Railway and Persian Gulf. The Negotiations with Hakki Pasha. REPORT. Lor the last month or so the undersigned have met Hakki Pasha twice a week at the Foreign Office to discuss the various questions arising out of the British memorandum of 18th July 1912. 1. The Shat-el-Arab arrangement presented no great difficulties except in matters of form. In Article 5 ITakki Pasha laid stress on the appointment of Turkish ' adjoints ; as they will have no special authority they will be unobjectionable. We have secured that the two chief officials shall be not only British but selected from candidates recommended by His Majesty's Government. Article tig was inserted by Hakki Pasha in order to cover the rights of the Bagdad Railway Company to construct a port at Basra. Articles 7 and 8 are the upshot of much discussion. We wanted the judicial powers of the Commission to be wider—in fact we wanted it to be constituted a court of first instance for all purposes. But Hakki Pasha could not agree to this, and as it appears that the Danube Commission now has no larger powers than those given by Articles 7 and 8, it did not seem politic to insist. The great object is that the local authorities should have as little opportunity as possible for thwarting the Commission, and that seems to be sufficiently assured. Article 11.—Ilakki Pasha was most unwilling to accept the maximum due, but we insisted, to some extent meeting him by Article 16, which, in effect, provides for a reconsideration of the limit in certain circumstances. Article 13.—We had proposed that the advance should be made by the two Governments, in order to be sure that some other Power did not step in. But Hakki Pasha was anxious that it should be the Turkish Government only, and the words ' apres entente avec le Gouvernernent Sa Majeste Britannique ' sufficiently serve our purpose. Article 14 presented considerable difficulty to Hakki Pasha, who wanted the Commission's budget to be voted annually by the Turkish Parliament. This had to be strongly resisted. Article 19 was much discussed as regards police, whom Ilakki Pasha wished to be lent by the Turkish Government. This would not secure them sufficient independence, and had to be resisted. A separate declaration provides that the Sheikh of Mohammera may entrust his interests to one of the Commissioners, meaning, of course, the British Commissioner. It will be necessary to supplement this by an agreement with the Sheikh binding him, his heirs and successors, to select the British Commissioner for the purpose. S. 204. — —II. As regards Koweit and the Persian Gnlf, Hakki Pasha produced a connterdraft to ours, which, though it contained ol)jectionable features, ue accepted as a basis for discussion. Article 1. Turkish and British views were irreconcilable on the question of ' suzerainty ' and ' sovereignty,' but as the important thing is the rights actually secured for Koweit and renounced by Turkey in the rest of the convention, and as ' suzerainty' is itself not a wholly unambiguous term, we agreed, in return for satisfactory definitions in the subsecjuent aitides, to omit either term, and to say that Ivoweit est un ^ aza autonome de 1 Enipiie Ottoman.' • In Article 2 Hakki Pasha laid stress on the Ottoman flag, and we accepted it, subject to the Sheikh's right to mark it with a special device. This has been wanted locally for many years past, but the Sheikh was aliaid ol Turkish displeasure. The formula ' Le Gouvernement Ottoman s'abstiendra de toute immixtion dans les affaires de Koweit, y compris la question de la succession' 1 was the result of much discussion. Hakki Pasha desired to say ' les affaires interieurcs,' to which we insisted on adding 'et exterieures,' without which neither the omission of reference to suzerainty or sovereignty nor the right to locate a Turkish agent at Koweit would be safe. Rather than accept this, Hakki Pasha would omit ' intericures et exterieures ' altogether, and we agreed to this subject to the signature of a separate secret note defining ' affaires ' as interieures et exterieures.' To this note Hakki desired to add that the Sheikh had not the right to conclude treaties (traite). In his counterdraft he had had a clause to the effect that the Sheikh could not in future conclude political agreements with foreign powers, and that economic agreements would require the sanction of the Turkish Government; but we had struck this out. We agreed to the addition to the note, with the insertion of the words ' contraire a la present e convention.' It is improbable that we shall ever again want to make a political treaty with Koweit which would conflict with the convention so long as the Turks observe it. The word traite ' would not, presumably, cover a lease of land ; but even that we are unlikely to want. Hakki Pasha further claimed to regulate the succession in the Sheikh's family. This we objected to, partly because it admitted Turkish interference, partly because it is contrary to British policy to recognise any but the de facto ruler. The formula which Hakki was induced to accept— that the Turks will name the successor a kaimmakam—is innocuous. In respect of Article 3 we were in some doubt as to whether the British right of pre-emption over certain lands (including Warba Island), given by the lease-agreement of 1907, should be specifically mentioned in the Convention. We were both agreed that it would be very impolitic to introduce it at the eleventh hour unless it was absolutely necessary. It seemed to be unnecessary for three reasons, (a) It was carefully considered last summer what should be communicated to the Turks, and neither Sir P. Cox nor the Government of India, nor the India Office, nor the Foreign Office, then suggested men tioning the right of pre-emption. (6) The wording of the Convention is very vague; 'la validite des concessions de terrains.' If the area of the ground leased had been defined, the Turks might have accused us of bad faith if it were afterwards to appear that we had rights over other ground ; as it is, we might have leased the whole of Koweit. (c) Now that Warba3 and the adjacent territory is formally secured to Koweit, while the railway is only to be continued to Koweit on conditions to be agreed to by us, the right of pre-emption loses much of its importance, its object having been to prevent the terminus of the railway from falling into foreign hands. We .nally decided not to raise the question. Article 4.— Ijikki Pasha was very anxious to have a re-assertion of Lord tansdot^e s aj^ur^nces of 1901, and there seemed no substantial objection l 0 making it. .4 rticles 5 and 7.—It seemed advisable to make the concession recognising two kinds of Koweit territory, and in return for it we got a rectification of our original southern border, so as to include Anta'a. Warba and Bubiyan, ol course, were difticult for him to surrender, ^but we insisted. Article G secures lor all practical purposes the sa. - n.atunomy for the Sheikh in the Lugei as in the s aller area. W e rOu 'scl^dllow i. nght of way for Turkish troops. In Athcle S Hakki Pasluv trif &gt;( ^ to ^JhnnVois tt, ISrkish protection for the linticind I mkish customs, ^.lie ^^'ding adopCOu all such questions open, while making their ultimate solntion subject to British approval. Articles 10-13 evirt the Turks completely from Bahrein and El Katr. In exchange we give them the islami o,! Zakhnuniya (for which, however, thev will pay the Sheikh of Bahrein 1,000L) and a small strip of coast. The safeguards required by the Government of India have been secured. We undertake not to annex Bahrein (but not, as Hakki Pasha desired, to abstain from altering the nature of our relations with it), and we undertake that the Sheikh of Bahrein shall not annex El Katr. III. In the declaration regarding the frontier near Mohammera a slight concession w r as made (after consultation with Sir P. Cox) in the northern part of the line, which will start at Um Chir and leave Kuskh-i-Basri to Turkey. On the Shat itself there was a direct conflict of opinion between Hakki Pasha and ourselves as to what the status quo is, he maintaining that the territory between Diaiji and the Xahr Xazaileh is in effective Turkish occupation, while we maintained the contrary. Finally he accepted our line vAti the proviso that if, on delimitation, it is found that the territory in questicn was in effective Turkish occupation on 1st January last, the line shall be neci'ified accordingly. There is very little likelihood that this will prove to be the case, but it may be noted that, even if it does, we get a rather better line than that given by the Mediating Commissioners in 1850, which left the Sheikh of Mohammera's palace at Failiyeh in Turkish territory. His Majesty's Government have, of course, to secure Persian acceptance of the line. IV. The British Memorandum of 18th July 1912 enclosed a draft convention on railway matters, but Hakki Pasha propounded a counter draft. This was quite unacceptable, and the Board of Trade prepared an alternative, which Hakki Pasha eventually accepted with some alterations (also prepared by Board of Trade) designed to avoid frequent disputes involving arbitration. Sir II. Llewellyn Smith took part in the discussion on this subject, and it is understood that he considers the result as satisfactory as any document islikely to be. Some additional safeguard against unfair differentiation in rates will be afforded by the presence of British directors on the Board. Altera tions in rates, according to Hakki Pasha, require the sanction of the Turkish Government, and it should be possible for the British directors to warn His Majesty's Government if any alteration adversely affecting British trade is proposed ; but too much stress must not be laid on this, since it has been impossible to provide that the directors shall actually be nominees of His Majesty's Government. V. Navigation of the Euphrates and Tigris. At an early stage Hakki Pasha threw out the suggestion of an amalgamation of all existing interests into one Turkish Company. We did not at the moment encourage the idea; but as time went on it was evident that other parties were moving and negotiations proceeding, and the Board of Trade and India Office inde pendently arrived at the conclusion that our interests could best be secured by an amalgamation on terms which there was good reason to think that the Turks might accept. We accordingly informed Hakki Pasha that we thought we could meet his wishes in this matter, and put forward a draft convention which the Board of Trade had prepared. The Turkish Govern ment have made counter proposals which seem to accord in principle with ours, and the question is still under consideration. (Signed) Louis Mallet. 3rd May 1913.
