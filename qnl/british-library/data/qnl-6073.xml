Dear Mr.Longrigg, Would you please refer to your letter of the 6 th November (p.C.35) regarding the acquisition of oil rights over the Koweit Neutral Zone. 2. As you are fully aware, the Sheikh has persisently refused to enter into negotiations with anyone for the grant of an oil concession in respect of his interest in the Neutral Zone. We see no likelihood of his changing his mind, and until he does so we do not think there would be any advantage in discussing possible solutions of the problem of operating oil concessions in that territory. 3. Meanwhile there is no reason to apprehend that your interests may go by default. Having in mind a promise given by the Sheikh in 1936 to Major Holmes as your Company^ representative we let the Sheikh know last year, following on a discussion with you here, that we assumed he would at once inform/ S.H.uongrigg Esq., Petroleum Concessions Ltd., King’s Head Hotel, Horsham, Sussex. f!'V. • - i y* 1 inform Petroleum Concessions Limited if he had any intention of modifying his previous refusal to open negotiations. If, contrary to expectation, the Shei 1th should fail so to inform you we should certainly be prepared to take steps, before approving the grant of a concession to another Company, to see that you had a reasonable opportunity to make your offer to the Sheikh. Yours sincerely. ;ere±y, (Sgcf.) R.

We have for a long time past been endeavouring to acquire the Shaikh of Kuwait’s rights over the territory. You instructed us in April, 1936 that our efforts must be limited to an option; but by your letter of June 14th, 1939 to me you intimated that no objection now existed to our applying to the Shaikh for a Concession. The acquisition of this concession would normally have found a place in our 1939/40 v/inter programme. As it is, you will appreciate that v/ar conditions restrict our activities considerably and make it less easy to despatch a senior representative to the spot. Nevertheless, we are far from willing to let our candidature for this territory fail by default, and we have in the past been encouraged to consider ourselves as candidates acceptable to H.M.G-* In these circumstances, we should be very grateful for 3 /our advice. If you can assure us that you would not concur in the grant of the rights concerned to any other party without our having been given prior notice and a fair chance to make our own offers, then we will gladly leave the matter as it now stands. If you cannot give such an assurance, do you think, it desirable that we should, make a forward move in the near future? We/2 We quite appreciate that the concession which v/e hope soon or ultimately to obtain would be in practice unworkable unless we can agree a practicable scheme of joint operation with the California Company; initial overtures for the framing of such a scheme were, in fact, considered some months ago, and could be followed up. It might take the form of a joint company to be formed ad hoc as soon as the Shaikh has granted us his half-rights, the concession document containing provision for this. Alternatively - and a tempting alternative in view of] t 2 ie great difficulty anticipated in working in territory under divided sovereignty - the Foreign Office and your own department might agree to recommend to the two rulers a physical division of the Zone into two parts, to be attached to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia respectively in full sovereignty. An unofficial conversation with K.M 1 s.Minister in Jeddah early this year did not seem to reveal any objection to this idea. These, obviously, are matters in which v/e depend on the policy and views of H.TI.G. We shall be grateful for any indication of these which you can give us, more particularly as they apply to our immediate problem of obtaining the Kuwait rights. Yours sincerely, Stephen H.Longrigg.

Rhoades thinks Shaikh will have arranged matters with Ibn Saud on his recent visit to Riyadh and will be prepared to negotiate.

It is with a certain amount of diffidence that T address Your Highness on the subject of the remaining Territory not allocated - of Your Highness* dominions outside the area acquired by your Oil Company. I must first make it clear to Your Highness that I have not mentioned the subject matter of txhis letter to any person or persons in Hngland or elsewhere. Therefore, may I suggest that no mention be made in regard to the contents herein to any of tine local non-subjects. As Your Highness* representative here, I feel that it is my duty to lay before Your Highness* certain suggestions and views which I trust may later be of some help to Your Highness when Your Highness deems the time appropriate to deal with the area discussed below. T wish, also, to inform Your Highness that T have no intention.of being an agent for any company or person desiring to acquire ih a concession for oil or other mineral from Your Highness. Yy one desire is to work for and on behal' of the interests of Your Highness so long as Your Highness wishes me to do so. The area to which this letter refers is that section of territory situated to the south of Your Highness’ boundary and which is held in joint ownership by Your Highness and the Euler of the adjoining Kingdom. Hereinafter referred to as the Joint Area . The Joint Area embraces a section of territory of approximately 1,861 square miles (English). The custom - in the past, when dealing with an unproved- 2 - area, has heen for Rulers to grant larger areas of prospective oil hearing territory to Companies ^hich are prepared to risk: a considerable amount of money to prove if it he oil hearing or not. Tt would he entirely inappropriate in the case of the Joint Area to grant the .vhole area in one concession, because the Joint Area is to all intent and purpose proved as being oil hearing. Oil has been discovered in highly payable quantities Mat both on the North and South of the Joint Area. Tiie oil bearing structures, of which there are two, in my opinion run through the Joint Area from north to south. There is no sign - on the Joint Area - of any disturbance of the earth’s structure, the formation of the rocks being in conformity with those to the north and south. It is well to point out to Your Highness that large areas are not necessary to success, for instance, the Bahrain concession has an area of 156 square miles, this restricted area has proved to be sufficient to develope a large yielding and prosperous oil company. Turther, all oil won on Bahrain has come from an area of about 10 souare miles. The position of and the fact that the Joint Area is a proved area, there can be no doubt as to its rich oil bearing potentia lities, brings up the question as to how the Joint Area should be presented to applicants for the oil rights. I have prepared a map of the 'Joint Area' on a large scale so that it will be more facile to read and to judge how best to divide the surface for developing the oil resources. Should Your Highness agree to the idea of partitioning the Joint Area, I shall do so into four equal parts, each of which will embrace approximately an area of 465 square miles, and for convenience will refer to the four divisions of approximately 465 square miles as Blocks. The long side of each of the Blocks being across the direc tion of the oil bearing structure - as marked out on the Nap - S and runs east and west.-3- The reason for dividing the Blocks in suoh manner is to ensure that each “block will include an equal part across the course of the oil “bearing structure which runs north and south. T would like to impress Your Highness tbrt in the Joint irea we are discussing an area which cannot - in my opinion - fail to produce oil in large quantities. Assuming Your-Highness agrees the idea of partitioning the Joint Area into four eaual Blocks, it “becomes necessary to put a price on each Block commensurate with the great prospective value of the area under discussion. T will now indicate what I consider the terms for each Block which may “be reasonably demanded - The initial payment of Rupees 450,000 on each Block, to “become payable within 90 days upon the signature of the concession agreement. As there is nothing to chose between the prospects and value of each individual Block, there is no reason why each of the four concessions should not be drawn up in identical terms. If and when the four Blocks are disposed of, the total initial payments will add up to Rupees 1,800,000, approximately £. 135,000, not an unreasonable figure when the prospects of the Joint Area are considered. There is one point to which T -wish to draw Your Highness’ particular attention: Your Highness will observe that the map shows that all four Blocks are as near as possible of the same superficial area. In my opinion, any small difference in the superficial area of the Blocks does not affect the oil bearing portion as all Blocks are similar in this respect. If the joint owners wished to divide the Joint Area into two equal parts and each joint owner to become full and entire owner one half of the Joint Area, this could be done by each taking i two blocks adjacent to their respective boundaries. If such an agreement were consummated it would simplify the -elopment and working of the oil resources, also provide complete-4- C ol freedom for each to dispose of his half as desired hy each Ruler. I would he much pleased if Your Highness would let me know when this letter reaches you. Thile the suggestions contained herein are not in any way immediately urgent, T would like Your Highness' ideas on them. T trust that all is well with Your Highness and Your family circle. 7 e are all well hut overloaded with farm work and short of 1 ah our. le both long for the day when we can again visit Your Highness. Tith good .wishes, I remain, Your Highness* sincere friend and faithful servant 3 d. Frank Holmes.

I imagine that Abdulla Mulla will prove more pliable than Dickson and that Bhoades f decision to bide his time before approaching the Shaikh is to enable him to pave the way gently and not as he would have me believe because he did not wish to shock His Highness, whose health he under stood was not as satisfactory as it might be, by too abrupt an approach.

They paid a courtesy call on His Highness on the same day and later called at the Agency. No business was discussed with His Highness or with the Political Agent. — Mr. ’Jioades stated that he had come to Kuwait for two purposes tfiich were (a) to approach the Shaikh with regard to acquiring his rights in the Neutral 2one f and (b) to prepare for certain preliminary operations in connection with the Eastern Gulf Oil Company Limited^ Sulphur Concession. Tith regard to the Neutral Zione Mr. Bhoades expressed surprise that the Shaikh had obtained such early information of the purpose of his visit. He would undoubtedly have been interested to learn the source of His Highness* information but care was taken not to satisfy his not unnatural curiosity. 2. Mr. Bhoades stated that he had been informed of the Shaikh*3 attitude by the India Office when he was in London, but that the instructions he had received from his principals were clear and he had no option but to make an approach to His Highness. I informed Mr. Bhoades that His Highness had made it plain to me that he was not prepared to discuss this question with him or with any other individual at the present time. Mr. Bhoades said he quite realised the position but he must carry out his instructions. If however the Shaikh informed him that he would not discuss the matter then there would be no more to be said for the time 'being. He does not propose to raise the question with His Highness for three or four weeks. • 3. Mr. Bhoades indicated that his Company (the Eastern Gulf Oil Company Limited) had had preliminary discussions with the California Arabia Standard Oil Company, who have already acquiredTon Saudis rights In the Neutral Zone, and that there was reason to believe that in the event of these negotiations with His Highness being successfully concluded the two conrpanles would be able to conclude a mutually satisfactory agreement for the development of the area. 4. &amp;r. ^ihoades stated that he would keep Mr. G.N. Jackson (who will act as Political Agent when I am in India) fully informed of the progress of the negotiations and that he proposed to utilise the services of Abdulla Mulla Saleh, His Highness 1 Secretary, as interpreter *hen he discussed matters with the Shaikh. With regard to the Sulphur Concession Hr. Rhoades stated that it had been indicated to the Sastern Gulf Oil Company Limited by the appropriate Department of the United States Government that personnel and equipment not required by the Defence Services could be made available for the preliminary investigation which was necessary to determine accurately if the Kuwait sulphur deposits were sufficiently concentrated to make development on a commercial scale practicable. then Mr. Hhoades understood that material for the Immediate development of the field and the erection of the necessary refinery would be made available from the United States. (He anticipated that within two years production would be possible). 2. Mr. Bhoades proposes to examine the equipment remaining here belonging to the Kuwait Oil Company Limited and to draw up lists of further equipment that will have to be sent from America for the preliminary work and he expects that this will take him three or four weeks. He will then return to the United States after visiting the California Arabia Standard Oil Company’s installation at Dharan and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s at Abadan.

'fr. iihoades thought that the equipment necessary for the operations would arrive from the United States in time for work to be commenced in October. He considered that the work would take from four to five months and that some six to ten drillers etc, presumably from the United States, would be employed.- 4. I understood from Mr. Rhoades that the production of sulphur was very necessary for war purposes especially in this part of the world and it was for this reason that the necessary eauipment would be made available. 5. Mr. Bhoades proposed to infona the Shaikh of his intention tomorrow and assured me that he would keep Mr. Jackson who was present throughout the interview in touch with all developments•Telegram 3 from Political \gent, Pu/ait m.

Reference my express letter No.Ext. 3173/43 of 13th June, 1943. Enclosed is a further letter from Major Holmes to His Highness the Sheikh of Koweit for delivery to the latter. (The issue of the above has been duly authorised)./•'N 12th June, 1943. TO His Highness Shaikh Sir Ahmed al Jahar as Subah, K.C.I.S., C.S.I., Kuwait. Your Highness Greetings, I wrote two letter to Your Highness both of which were dated 4th June, The reason for this letter is to make clear to Your Highness the potential value - in revenue to the State of Kuwait - of 'Transit Dues', During my last visit to Kuwait I discussed with /oir Highness the question of Your Highness granting a transit permit right to Petroleum Concessions for conveying the oil won from ohe Basra concession to Kuwait; this would also call for the right to build a pipe-line to convey the oil from the Basra - Kuwait boundary to the Kuwait Harbour. When X wrote on June 4th to Your Highness I was unable to give' the amount of the 'Transit Dues' per ton ofoil delivered to the Kuwait end of the pipe-line as I had forgotten and had to rexer to Mr. Skliros, which I have now done. The 'Transit Dues' - payable to Your Highness oy the Company - would be at the rate of Annas 2 (Two) per ton of Oil imported through Kuwait Territory from tne Basra concession i^rea. In order to give Your Highness some idea of the importance of such 'Transit Dues' the revenue from each one million tons of Basra Concession Oil - delivered adjacent to the Kuwait Harbour - would amount to Rupees 125,000(One hundred and twenty five thousand ruppees). As the development of the Basra Oil Concession Area crorresses it is reasonable to assume that the yearly output of Oil from the rich Basra Concession Area - will increase to several million tons per annum, with a corresponding increase oj. Revenue to the State of Kuwait. The Transit of oil scheme from Basra is a business that must be secured for the State of Kuwait, as iu presents no difficulties nor will it cause any expense to Your Highness oeyond COPY. \G 4-) d MILLHILL, SANDON, CHELMSFORD. ESSEX.' ■? • br. -irr-- r N \ - 2 - the salaries of two or three men to check - on Your Highness’ ^ behalf - the quantity of oil arriving at the Kuwait terminus of the pipe-line on which ’’Transit Dues” is payable. Your Highness may have heard that the Americans have built a new river port near Fao on the Shatt-al-Arab. I am not altogether happy about these activities on the 3hatt-al-Arab, so am anxious to hear Your Highness’ ideas on the transit of Oil scheme across Kuwait territory. There is one thing I do not wish to wake up one morning to be,told that the Basra oil is to be pumped to a Shatt-al-Arab port and thus lose to Kuwait an exceptionally fine source of revenue. Your Highness need not have any doubts that the amenities of the town of Kuwait or its surroundings shall be affected detrimentally. The pipeline will most probably deliver the oil on the north shore of the Kuwait If rt our, a few miles east of Jarrah, There is much space to develop the necessary facilities for handling the shipment and even refining of the oil, and that area being so remote no inconvenience will be experienced by the people # of Kuwait town. The Harbour of Kuwait is certainly a very rich possession and its development in the years to come will exceed all expectations, I trust that Your Highness will not weary of the ideas put before Your Highness from time to time. My excuse is that I have only one thought in my mind and that is I desire nothing but to help, to the extent of my abilities, and always having a deep regard for the welfare of the person of Your Highness and of your people. One of my greatest possessions and most dear to me is the friendship of Your Highness granted me during many years, I am always grateful.

Rhoades emphasised at the outset that his proposed visit to Koweit had other objects besides that of negotiating with the Sheikh about the neutral zone. His Company’s sulphur concession in Koweit obliged them to undertake a certain amount of drilling before December 1944, and he wished to make arrangements for this on the spot. He did not know how the Sheikh had heard that he wished in addition to discuss the neutral zone, but he had no desire t: make a secret of his intentions in this respect. 3. I said that the Sheikh had not got his information from us or from the local Political authorities. He had told the latter that he would not discuss the question of the neutral zone with anyone, and they had passed this on to us with the suggestion that we should inform Rhoades accordingly. We would not be prepared to put pressure on the Sheikh in a matter of this Kino., or even attempt to influence him one way or another. Rhoades said that he appreciated this ? -and did not suspect the Political authorities of having influenced the Sheikh’s present attitude. lie agreed with me that the Sheikh had, for reasons of his own, maintained this attitude over a number of years, and that he had refused to depart from it at the time of his (Rhoades') visit -to Koweit in 1940. 4 . i felt bound to tell Rhoades that Petroleum Concessions Ltd. had also heard - but not from us - of his pr^csed visit to Koweit, and had said that if he was going/ The Hon.

July 6th. July 8th. July 12th. July 15th. The Shaikh informed Rhoades that he would not discuss the Neutral Zone question. Ohliger of C.A.S.O.C., Dharan, informed Rhoades that he had made arrangements for his visit and would nave him met at Kabrit. He said the Saudi Government had been informed•and had no objection. PS. Rhoades infoxnaed New York of^Shaikh’s decision through the Agency (copy of telegranflattached) • Rhoades left for Dharan and was met by Lebkekar at Kabrit. Smelli a Kuwait Oil Company director telegraphed to Rhoades from London to the effect that Hamilton wanted him to join him promptly in London. This telegram was sent to Rhoades at Dharan. / July 18th. Smelli sent a reminder. July 19th. Rhoades returned to Kuwait. % July 24th. July 27th. Rhoades left for Basra and England. Later in the day Dickson received the following telegram from Sire 111 'Hamilton suggests Rhofedes proceeds home whichever quickest and most convenient route.' This was passed on to Rhoades at the Air Port Hotel, Basra. Dicksjon received a letter from Rhoades saying he was flying direct to the U.D.A. , RV August 13th. Abdul Aziz al Nafisi, the Saudi Government Agent (approx.) complained to Dickson that apparently Rhoades hud gone to Dharan without proper permission having been obtained as he had now received a letter of complaint from the Amir of Hh&amp;bb&amp;r upbraiding him, Nafisi, for not having let him xnow that Rhoades was coming and saying he had no information from other sources. 3 # Rhoades flys out from the United States to discuss a subject he has been informed on the best authority that the bnaikh will not even consider and to maxe arrangements for extensive winter exploration by the Sulphur Company.

My dear Sir Geoffrey, Political Agency, Kuwait 28th August 1943. .7 Please re^er to my demi-official letter No.631 dated the 28th August 1943. 2. I am enclosing copies of five letters from Holmes and a copy of a telegram to him from His Highness. I have recently been informed by the Shaikh that he has agreed to Holmes’ suggestion of visiting Kuwait in the'autumn and I nave seen a telegram from Holmes which announced his intention of arriving here in October or November if he coitld obtain the necessary passage. 3. The first letter written on the 23rd of February contains a suggestion for the sub-division of the Neutral Zone should the Shaikh be prepared to negotiate. The first of the letters of the 4th &lt;5f June indicates clearly where Holmes * sympathies lie and where he thinks the Shaikh’s should, even suggesting a possible loss of money, a very potent arguement with His Highness,should he inclined to favour American interests. The letter is interesting but is not factually correct. The second letter of the 4th of , i June is an intimation that P.C.L. propose to enter the arena t if the games are held. The letter.of the 12th of June deals more fully with the transit of Basra Oil to Kuwait and forecasts the developement of Kuwait harbour. I have no record of this transit suggestion.previously having been put forward. The last letter suggests that the old warrior may possibly try his hand again at the old game. 1 The Honourable Sir Geoffrey Prior, KCIE f Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire . / Tours sincerely, 7 ; ji iCopy of letter dated ^he 4th June 1945 from Major Trank Holmes, Lixihill,3andon, Cheliueford* 2Mtx # to Kla Highness Shaikh 3ir Ahmad al Jabar as 3ubah,K«0.I«E#.Kuwait. In considering to whoa the Oil Concession, covering Your Highness’ interest in the Neutral Zone, should eventually be granted, there are several points which It is necessary to ua .\6 into account apart from those oerteining to the Neutral Zone I will, with Your Highness* permission, lay before Your Highness my ideas which I hope will be welcome. The first is the final designation of the Oil won from the Area under discussion. If the concession be given to the Crulf Oil Company ( represented by Hr. Hhoades ) in partnership with the Standard Oil Coy - the latter having the rights of His Majesty’s interest th in the Neutral Zone - there is the prospect ,as the Standard Oil Coy has a refinery near Has Tanura ( Katif ), it- follovrs that oil recovered from the Neutral Zone will be diverted to that refinery and Your Highness 1 interest - in the Oil obtained from the Neutral Zone - will be confined solely to the Royalty payable per ton on Oil won. In these circumstances it appears to me that there will certainly be a loss of control by Your Highness if the oil be pumped to Has Tanura refinery. The question of labour control in a joint company may present difficulties and div rt certain charges , difficult to enumerate off-hand, but deal principally with local labour employment conditions. Your Highness may remember a discussion I had - at Mr. Skli^os* instigation - ith Your Highness, when last in Kuwait , dealing with the Transit Cues payable to Your Highness upon Oil brought from Basra for shipment through Kuwait Harbour. The Transit Dues payable upon such Oil would eventually provide a large sum of money each year and would -continue to increase as the Oilfields of Basra Vilayet developed. In fact, the revenue from Oil in transit is without cost to Your Highness except perhaps for the salaries of two or three local men for chsoklng , on behalf of Your Highness, the amount of Oil arriving through the pipe line at Kuwait end. . In addition the Oil won from Your Highness* half of the Neutral Zone will no doubt pass through Kuwait Ilarbuur. After close study of the whole position in Kuwait - in respect of the oil development v/ithin Your Highness* sheikhdom and taming the rich prospect of a constant and large revenue from transit oil from Basra - I feel confident that greater gain would ensue to Your Highness if your half interest in the Neutral Zone were placed with Mr. Sklircs to develop and would give Your Highness fuller control and yield richer results than can be provided by any other applicant. I make this statement with much confidence as no other * applicant can make a 'transit dues' offer as all the Iraq Oilfields, including Basra Vilayet, are under the control of Mr. Skliros* Companies. I have no personal interest in anyway as to who secures the oil rights of Territory under Your Highness* control except to point out what I consider would be most advantageous to the interest of Your Highness and Your people.n ii 4th June 1943.

JSr. Rhoades is now in London, he informed me ohat it was his intention to visit Your Highness so soon as he could secure a passage by one of the Overseas Airway aeroplanes. From Mr. Rhoades* talk I gathered that he hoped to be able to discuss with you e. concession agreement covering Your Highness * portion of the Neutral Zone, but he wishes, in the first place, to conclude with Your Highness some business with the Sulphur Company. . Mr. Shliros - with Your Highness* kind permission - will also wish to renew his application for an Oil concession covering Your Highness* half of the Neutral Zone whenever you deem it wise to enter into such negotiations. It is very gratifying to know that I shall not q - in the future - be in the ositlon of a negotiator and having to request something from Your Highness Instead of being free to assist Your Highness and so repay, ir small decree, the manifold kindnesses I have always received from Your Highness, for which I am -tost grateful.

If It was with much pleasure I received your cable informing me of Your Highness 1 decision regarding any application made to you. I am in full agreement and feel that Youi* Highness has made a vd.se decision. The Oil world are all endeavouring to secure rights over territory which gives signs of being productive. These su den activities of oil interests - outside the British Empire - caused quite a little consternation among the British Oil interests in London, as such a move was entirely unexpected especially from the quarter from which the intense activities developed. In my opinion. Your Highness acted with wisdom and vision when you decided to postpone consideration of all such applications. Personally I was much pleosed to hear of Your Highness’ ideas , but it is well for me to confess to Your Highness that I hope that Your Highness ’ old and tried Jdnglish friends will be given an opportunity in developing whatever resources Your Highness eventually decides upon. I would much like to visit Kuwait in October or November of this year; I have no business to discuss with you and would come purexy to see Your Highness and heve one or two months of Kuwait air and relaxation. So if Your Highness is agreeable to my visiting Kuwait, I would be much pleased if Your Highness , upon receipt of this letter, would kindly send me a telegram agreeing the visit.

We would not be prepared to put pressure on the Sheikh in a matter of this kind, or even attempt to influence him one way or another. Rhoades said that he appreciated this and did not.suspect the Political authorities of having influenced the Sheikh’s present attitude. He agreed with me that the Sheikh had, for reasons of his own, maintained this attitude over a number of years, and that he had refused to depart from it qj the time of his (Rhoades’) visit to 'Koweit in 1940. 4 .

(&amp;) Private &amp; Confidential. My dear Bridgeman Kuv/ait - Neutral Zone I am informed that the failure of certain recent negotiations has not been received with good grace by the Principals concerned, and that it is proposed to approach the matter afresh from a different angle; the idea is that Ibn Saud should be induced to bring pressure to bear on the Shaikh between those two Rulers, but Ibn Saud is of good rirab stock, and I doubt whether, during his lifetime, whatever be the appearances, Saudi Arabia will be allowed to do much coercion on one whose father fed and sheltered Ibn Saud for many years before he carved out for himself a throne of his own. Be that as it may, it looks as if one must continue to watch the position with vigilance. I do not propose to move P'.C.L. in the matter, for the present* any such premature approach could only be met by the same old interim reply that the time is not yet propitious. The Shaikh still fancies his chance for a mutually satisfactory partitioning of that Zone, he retaining the Northern half and, as that is probably the better half, I am content to wait until he is in full possession. to the Shaikh, the former said that he v/ould like to visit Kuv/ait if the Shaikh considered it advisable, and the latter has cabled that Holmes would be very welcome. My own deferred line of action v/ould be quite well served by Holmes visiting the Shaikh in his capacity of Adviser to him in oil matters; there is no question of my employing Holmes as P.G.I. negotiator, and for the present I am not asking for anything. or early November, returning by the end of the year.

Since then, however, there has been an announcement in the press about a new Arabian pipeline project to be undertaken by the u.S. Government.

Kr. Geoffrey Lloyd is therefore anxious that Major Holmes should visit Kuwait as soon as possible, since any first hand news we may get from that part of the world may well be of value in connection mth future Anglo-American negotiations. I should therefore be grateful if you would let me know whether you agree that a return air passage m^ now be sponsored in vfoich case I will inform the Company.

His Hi^iness has always preferred an interpreter who is not a subject of Kuwait, as he wishes to avoid having his private business broadcast in the bazaar. When His Highness was planning a visit to England in 1935 he suggested that my mtepreter - who is a British subject and a native of India - should accompany him, it was arranged accordingly. The name of the Interpreter is:- Ashrafali Sharosuddin, Dhorikin, Varacha Road, Surat, India. Whilst in London His Hi finest had several interviews at the India Office at which the above named Indian was the interpreter. Lord Zetland, who at the time (1935) v/as Secretary of State for India, congratulated Ashrafali upon his excellent command of both English and Arabic; some of the India Office officials will remember the Indian interpreter who visited the India office with His Highness. My business with his Hi^iness is relevant to my position as His Hi tineas * representative in London and to deal with the Kuwait Oil Company and the Gulf S ulphur Company^ affairs. The position at present is that during the past 4 years it has not been possible for me to visit Kuwait, as a resu.lt, many unsettled questions have accumulated which can only be fully cleared up by meeting and agreeing than by direct talks. if I be granted a permit at an early date it would enable me to settle outstanding problems. if permission could be given for Ashrafali to visit Kuwait, I would be grateful. Yours truly, Sd. FRAHK HOLMES. MINISTRY OF FUEL AMD POSTER Ext. 7 li/44 • (PETROLEUM DIVISION), 7, KILLBANK, S.tf.l. 15th February, 1944. Dear Peel, I enclose a copy of a letter dated February 12th which I have just received from major Holmes. I understand that the Shaikh of Kuwait is -thought to he somewhat doubtful about the reliability and discretion of his present secretary. Major Holmes therefore believes that the Shaikh would be likely to converse with him more freely if he could be provided with an inteppreter in whom the Shaikh is known to have confidence. As we ourselves are anxious at the moment to get as much information as possible from that part of the world, particularly as regards the reception of the announcement of the new American projects, we should like to support MajorMajor Holmes* request* If you see no objection to the pro posal, perhaps it might be possible for you to communicate with the External Affairs Department in Delhi, asking them to issue an exit permit to Aahrafali on receiving his application On hearing from you that this bad been bone, 1 would inform Major Holmes so that he could send a message to Ashrafali advising him to apply for an exit permit for Kuwait.

I think you are aware that we do not see Ibn Saud through quite the same rose coloured spectacles as Foreign Office. While under obligation to and professing deep- est affection for Kuwait he did his best to strangle her, and while owing hi s throne largely to our subsidies he gave only valuable concession to competitors. Recent action over Dhahran wireless has shown that he does not like his friend ship to cost him anything. 3 . Ibn Saud's Syrian advisers do not act independently and I saw nothing surprising in remarks attri buted to King.

It seems clear from 3upplemental Agreement dated 31st May 1939 to Saudi Arab Oil Concession that Arabian American Oil Company (successors to California Arabian Standard Oil Company) possesses all concessionary rights in the Kuwait Neutral Zone that the Government of Caudi Arabia is entitled to grant. 2. Shaikh of Kuwait's attitude that he had no intention of granting any concessionary rights in Neutral Zone was reiterated as&gt;^ecently as December 1944 vide Residency telegram No. 22o2 15th December. Gulf Oil Corporation, who own half interest in Kuwait Oil Company, is however one of the three Companies behind trans-Arabian pipe line and my be expected to bring to bear through American interests in Kuwait Oil Company every inducement on Ghaikh, to grant not only facilities required for construction of pipe line but also concessionary rights to American interests in Neutral Zone. 3. On the face of it Aramco's present request does not amount to seeking of any concessionary rights. Plan of pipeline howevor, so far as is known here, provides for feeder line from Kuwait south west to main pipe line. This might deter construction of refinery at Kuwait which Ghaikh is keen on. Discovery of practical landing place on coast of Neutral Zone may also affect development of water front iIS zl - 2 - ^i u \ at Kuwait, 4 , iiy latest inforniation regarding pipe line project is that contained in papers received under India Office Printed Letter No, Kxt. 6854 January 13th 1 c j 45. In absence of more information as to policy of His Majesty*s Government towards pipe line project generally I have not yet informed Shaikh of Aramco’s request for permission to survey coast. I have further learnt on my recent visit to Abadan that Lloyd Hamilton regards construction of pipe line a certainity. Shaikh is likely to follow our advice in the natter but I should be glad to learn whether he should be pressed to accord permission should he be reluctant to do so. He is also likely to enquire attitude of His Majesty's Government toward pipe line project, 5 , I should also be glad if possible to be in a position to inform Shaikh what agency Company will employ to carry out survey if permission is granted.

Sir I have the honour to say that Brigadier General Walter B. Pyron, Director of the Kuwait Oil Company and, I believe I am correct in saying, Vice President of the Eastern Gulf Oil Corporation arrived in Kuwait on the 21st Inarch, 1946 accompanied from -^asra by Major Prank Holmes, His Highness’ representative with the Kuwait Oil Company in London. General Pyron is also I understand in charge of the Gulf Oil Corporation’s activities in Europe and the Middle East. Mr. C.W. Hamilton another Director of the Kuwait Oil Company, who came out from the United States of America by air with General Pyron was taken ill in Habbaniyah and did not come to Kuv/ait. General Pyron left for -^abbaniyah via Abadan to see Mr. C.W. Hamilton whose condition was causing some anxiety and returned to Kuwait on the 27th March leaving again on the 30th March to take Mr. Hamilton back to the United States of America. 2. After General Pyron’s departure, I asked His Highness whether he had made any overtures regarding the Neutral Zone to which the Ruler replied *1 shut him up and said it was no use discussing it' The question was, therefore, apparently mooted. 3. General Pyron is reputed to be an expert on oilfield develop ment within sea areas but I do not know if that information is correot.

He would then, of course, be in a position to yrent a much wore valuable concession. 4. If he regards the present boundaries as permanent it Is difficult to see why he Hat consistently refused to grawt a concession although Bin S^ud lias done so In respect of his share of the Zone.

For the above reason we request you to be so kind a^s to inform His Majesty’s Government about this matter and to obtain their consent to enable us to open discussions with anyone coming forward, and we hope to receive a speedy and favourable reply.

Kuwait Skliros and ’Vheatley of P.--C.L. left United Kingdom on November 12th to open negotiations with Shaikh for his oil rights. 2. We understand as a^result of consultations between Anglo-I rani an Oil Company and Grulf Oil Corporation the partners in Kuwait Oil Company, it has been mutually agreed between the two groups that if either of them should obtain oil rights from Shaikh of Kuwait in Neutral Zone it would share them equally with the other. Anglo- Iranian Oil Company for their part however do not feel able to pompete in their own name in Neutral Zone until it is definitely established whether they are still bound by red line Agreement or not. Pending clarification of this point which may take some time they feel bound to confine themselves to participation in offer tp be made by P.C.L. df which they are one of the member groups. Incidentally we do not repeat not feel we can rely too much on above mentioned understanding between A.I.O.C. and Gulf proving effective if occasion airises as United States Government might have contrary views. 3. His Majesty’s Government attach great importance to British interests obtaining a share of any oil concessions granted in respect of the Neutral Zone and as indicated inpny telegram No.18672 the application of P.C.L. as a British Company in which Shell and A.I.O.C. hold substantial share is supported bn this account. It appears possible however that (that) company’s bid will not be success ful since they may well be reluctant to accept royalty terms in this area which are substantially higher than in other Middle Fast areas over which P.C.L - I.P.C. group already hold concessions. Moreover there are some indications that American groups in P.C.L. may decide to press view that Red Line iigreement lapsed owing to war time circum stances affecting French group. 7/e understand Standard Oil of New Jersev have reserved right to apply independently for rights in NeutiaL Zone and if‘they were to proceed on this line Secony Vacuum might follow suit. 4. It is therefore possible that in addition Caltex wm who already hold Saudi-Arabian rights in Neutral Zone Standard Oil of i New Jersey and oossiblv Secony Vacuum may enter field as individual American competitors o£ P.C.L. Gulf Oil Corporation may well also ' j compete although they ( and likewise A.I.O.C.} arelikely to be rest- ? rained by consideration that success in Neutral Zone would inevitably carry with it a high royalty rate which in all probability would then also have to be accepted by Kuwait Oil Company m Kuwait proper. 5. In view of possibility that P.C.L. may be unsuccess ful in obtaining a share of Neutral Zone rights an^informal suggest ion of which Hay is aware recently made by Burma Oil Company has been encouraged by His Majesty's Government. They are a British concern of international repute and well equipped botn financially and tech nically. They are independent of A.I.O.C. and Shell in their product ion and marketing policy outside India Burma and are in no way mvol-^ ved in the I.P.C. group or Red Line Agreement^ They may^be interested in possibility of obtaining an oil concession in Kuwait Neutral Zone and would welcome opportunity of^-sending a representative to open negotiations with Shaikh if this^acceptable to him. 6. Both P.C.L. and B.O.C. wpuld have full support of His Majesty’s Government in their negotiations with Shaikh as being British Companies of high standing and experience. With two British companies in running the prospect'of securing British participation will be extended and we would hope that one or other of these two /companies- 2 - ZZS / companies will be successful in obtaining grant of Shaikh's rights in Neutral Zone and will then be able to come to an arrangement with Caltex for a merger between rights of Shaikh and Ibn Saud. 7. Please inform Shaikh of. B.O.C.'s interest and of their desire to send a representative to open negotiations if this meets with Shaikh's approval. T Ve assume that Shaikh will not wish to raise any obieetions having regard to statement reported in Kuwait telegram No.570 that he was now prepared to consider bids from all comers. 8. 7e are anxious to avoid misunderstanding on &gt; part of P.C.L. representative and you may therefore if you think fit inform_ them (a) that B.O.G. may be entering the field tb) that if they do it will be on their own initiative and (c) that they will not be favoured by His Majesty's G-overnment at expense of P.G.L. o^ course had experience of oil negot iafi ohs in Middle East countries and will no doubt welcome your guidance on type and level of represent ation which they should arrange and any other matters relevant to special conditions of Persian Oulf. has not r « 10.

Political ILB.GOMFIDiiMTIrtli. Mo.C/678. Political Agency, Kuwait . Dated the 9th December, 1946 SujbjQQt?- Neutral Zone I think I have fathomed the reasons underlying the Shaikh’s attitude towards Petroleum Concession Limited which formed the subject of my telegram No.571 dated the 22nd October^ 1946 and has been puzzling me for sometime, 2. The trouble was f I imagine, that the Shaikh feared that Petroleum Concession Limited were going to try to claim pre ferential treatment on the grounds of long standing acquaintance and old friendship with him. He told me on several occasions that he did not know Skliros personally and had had no regular ' J ' ~ exchanges of greetings, presents etjcetera. Later on he told me, while on the same subject, that Holmes, when negotiating with him for the Kuwait Concession^had presented him first with a launch and a motor car. 3* In actual fact it was not Skliros 1 intention to make any such claim and I advised him to make this quite clear to His Highness. Petroleum Concessions Limited did, in fact, make him a pure and simple business offer and I think he was much relieved. At any rate he has completely dropped his previous , 'line of talk' emphasising that he was under no sort of obligation to the company. Under the circumstances I think that my suggestion that Petroleum Concessions Limited should be less un-oriental in their approach was wrong and that their tactics were probably correct. M.B.

I should be glad to have your comments. 2. With reference to the first sentence of paragraph A of my telegram No,18672 of 19th October, copy is enclosed of notes exchanged with the Legal Adviser, India Office regarding the extent to v/hich the Sheikh of Koweit is bound in respect of the / Neutral Zone by the 1913 correspondence., (The issue of the above has been d’My authorised) (Sgd) E P. DONALDSONIndia Office, Whitehall, S.W. 1# Ext.7930/46 . ^ (g December, 1946. oCu^ K-uM. Nov; that the question of some Oil Company, British or American, obtaining an oil concession from the Sheikh of Koweit covering his rights in the Koweit Neutral Zone has become a live issue, perhaps some preliminary consideration should be given to the question of a political agreement being eventually drawn up betv/een the successful Company and His Majesty* s Government. * 2, You will be aware that similar political agreements have been concluded with the respective concessionaire companies in the case of all the Arab States of the Persian Gulf - with BAPCO in respect of Bahrein, with P.C.L. in respect of Muscat; Qatar and the individual Trucial Sheikhdoms, and with the Koweit Oil Company in respect of Koweit proper. Briefly, the effect of these political agreements is that the Oil Company concerned undertakes to respect the position of our political authorities in the Sheikhdoms, that British, strategic and other interests are safeguarded and that an undertaking is given to enable the production and resources of the Company to be placed at the disposal of His Majesty’s Government in the event of national emergency or war. There is also in the Koweit Political Agreement a clause to the effect that the Company will erect a refinery, if commercially justifiable, and will consult with His Majesty’s Government about this. (There is a Special Refinery Agreement with P.C.L The Companies further undertake to remain British by registration (likewise in respect of any transferee or subsidiary companies) and to employ as many British subjects or subjects of the Ruler as is consistent with the efficient carrying on of the undertaking. Prom the point of view of the Company the effect is that they secure the co-operation of the British political authorities in obtaining from the Ruler the assistance they require in oil developments. K.L.Stock, Esq., Ministry of Fuel and Power, Millbank, S.W. 1, /3.3. The case of the Koweit Neutral Zone is different from that of the other Sheikhdoms in two main respects:- (a) the oil rights of the whole of the Zone are at present held jointly by Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit and * (b) the Sheikh of Koweit may consider that he is not bound under the terms of the 1913 correspondence (a copy of v/hich is “ ' enclosed) to secure ( To Sheikh of Koweit, dated the agreement of His ( 27th October, 1913 Majesty's Government ( Prom Sheikh of Koweit, dated before concluding a ( 27th October, 1913. concession for the —•— — ’ Neutral Zone; thus we might find it difficult to use the necessity of obtaining our consent to a concession agreement as a lever with the Oil Company in securing the conclusion of a political agreement. A copy of notes exchanged with the Legal Adviser, India Office, is enclosed in connection with the legal position. 4, The form which any political agreement for the Neutral Zone would have to take would, of course, depend on whether Galtox, who already hold Ibn Saud's share of the oil rights, obtain the Koweit share also, or whether another Company - British or American - do, and in the latter event on what kind of arrangements they E»ake^with Galtex for co-operation in working the Zone. In this connection the question whether the Zone will be exploited from the Koweit or Saudi Arabian side (or both) will also be relevant. There is also, I suppose, the possibility of an arrangement being come to whereby the Zone is divided into two distinct geographical areas, one of which Caltex might exploit on behalf of Ibn Saud and the other of which another Company might exploit under a concession from the Sheikh of Koweit. Although, therefore, we cannot go very far at the moment in considering the details of any political agreement, we assume that His Majesty's Government will wish to have such an agreement, and it may be desirable to familiarise the competing Companies with the idea at a fairly early date. This would seem to apply particularly to the Burmah Oil Compaiy who are not entirely familiar with the political set-upi 3. oot-up in the Persian Gulf; F.C.L. are, of course, already familiar with the idea of political agreements and may perhaps be expected without difficulty to fall in with His Majesty's Government's wishes on the subject. 5. 1 &gt;Ve should be glad to have your observations generally. I am sending a copy of this letter to Garran at the Foreign Office and Dodds at the Admiralty (with a copy of the relevant telegrams) and should be glad to have any comme/its they may wish to offer. The Admiralty would, I think, be primarily interested in a political agreement from the point of view of tac Pre-emption Clause usua.lly included in these political agreements. We are also asking the Political Resident whether he has any comments. , t h.

In 1913 (at a time when an area now including the Neutral Zone was claimed by Kuwait) the Sheikh of Kuwait agreed in an exchange of correspondence with the Political Resident bhat he would not give an oil concession in respect of Burgon (a place in Kuwait territory proper) 'and elsewhere' other than t-» r&gt;. person appointed from the British Government, The question has now arisen how far, if at all, he Sheikh of Kuwait is bound by the 1913 correspondence in respect of his desire to grant an oil concession covering his righ’js in the Neutral Zone, We should be grateful for any opinion you feel able to give on this point, (Sd) F. A. K* Harrison. 29th November, 1946. I assume of course, that the condition precedent to the obligation under which the Sheikh placed himself in 1913 was strictly fulfilled, i,e, that there seemed at that time in the view of Admiral Slade and the Sheikh’s son hope of obtaining oil from the place of bitumen shown. If so, then it seems to me that, in so far as it still lies in the power of the Sheikh to grant a concession in the neutral territory, whether jointly with Ibn Saud or in relation to a tract geographically separated under an agreement with the latter, and assigned to himself, there would be no justification for his not adhering to his undertaking. The matter might, however, stand on a different footing if it were successfully contended that the neutral • territory never in fact belonged to the Sheikh, his present joint rights therein dating only from 1922.

Shaikh Mubarak 1 s letter la not in the fora* of an agreement and refers to a specific # evasion* Although he uses the word 'never” I cannot believe that he Intended to bind himself and his successors for all time in respect of all oil concessions in his territory* In 6 lr Percy Cox's letter Shaikh ubarak was asked to agree that Admiral tlade should inspect the places at Burgan and elsewhere showing traces (presumably external) of bitumen and that if the /doiral saw any hope of obtaining oil therefrom he (the Shaikh) ••ould not give a concession for it to anyone other than a person nominated and recommended by the British Government. The Shaikh replied that if the Admiral came he would send one of his sens with him to show the place of bitun^en in Burgan and elsewhere and that if In their view (*in the view of the admiral and the Shaikh's son ?) there seemed a hope of obtaining oil therefrom he uould never give a concession In this ssattep to anyone except a persrn appointed by the British Government. The most that can be read into this, in my opinion, is a promise by Shaikh 'ubarak not to give an oil concession except to our nominee in places showing traces of bitumen which were inspected by the Adniral and the Shaikh's son (?) and from which he and the son l?) were of opinion that oi might be obtained. I have nothing on record to sho* what places were Inspected by the Admiral and what his views were regarding the prospects of obtaining oil from, them* but I do not see how Shaikh ubarak' s letter can possibly be read as covering places not inspected by the Admiral and I era very doubtful if it can be held to cover places so inspected and not claimed at the time /rf/ for exploita tion especially after a lapse of so many years* 4.

Since no difficulty appears to be anticipated in concluding a Political Agreement with either of the British Companies involved the question boils down to the best way of inducing an American company to sign one. I suggest that we should at once ask any American company opening negotiations wheter or not they are prepared to sign such an agreement if successful. They would probably agree out of fear that refusal to do so would prejudice their chances but it seems that some clauses (e.g. British Registration and employment of British Subjects) would have to be omitted or modified. 3.
