                           Elizacountry ship, commanded by Mr Woodhead. William Bruce, Resident at Bushire, acknowledges the receipt of Government commands dated 8 June 1820 and refers to his own letters of 22 and 26 April (see ff 42v-44 and ff 45-46 respectively), which regarded the circumstances surrounding the death of Belall Sedee, and which led to the appointment of a committee to investigate the subject. Bruce acknowledges the senior magistrate's verdict that Mr Woodhead's conduct was proper and correct. He goes on to recount the results of enquiries made by Captain Francis Erskine Loch regarding the treatment received on board the
                           Eliza, which were made prior to the aforementioned investigation into Mr Woodhead's conduct.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054291.0x000055#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
