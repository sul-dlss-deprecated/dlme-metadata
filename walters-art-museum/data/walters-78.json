As was typical for the period, the \"uraeus\" had two coils, one to each side and the tail extended back over the top of the rounded \"nemes.\"  Beneath the edge of the band of the \"nemes\" the natural hairline of the figure may be seen.  The eyes are naturally outlined and the brow delicately follows the contour of the eye.  The pupils and irises of the eyes are picked out in black paint.  The surface of the piece has been scratched and chipped in several places.  The face is fleshy and rather flat in profile.  The lips are pursed and smiling.  The back, sides and base are flat planes and there are grid squares etched into the back and sides. Where the lappets touch the shoulder they are creased in an unnaturally sharp way.  The lappets are flat with a curved outer edge and strictly vertical inner edge.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1920", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/3028", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1920, by purchase; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "Ptolemaic Dynasty", "Reign": null, "OnView": 1, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:13:38.953", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.54_Fnt_DD_T11.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.54_Fnt_DD_T11.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.54_Fnt_DD_T11.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.54_Fnt_DD_T11.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.54_Fnt_DD_T11.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "PL9_22.54_Fnt_BW_H43.jpg, PS1_22.54_3QtrLft_DD_T11.jpg, PS1_22.54_3QtrRt_DD_T11.jpg, PS1_22.54_Back_DD_T11.jpg, PS1_22.54_Fnt_DD_T11.jpg, PS1_22.54_Lft_DD_T11.jpg, PS1_22.54_RtSide_DD_T11.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Centre Street: Second Floor: Egyptian Art"}
