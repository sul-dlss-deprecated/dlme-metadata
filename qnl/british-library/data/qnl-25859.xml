Most of all you will find the manners, customs, and ways of living odd and incomprehensible. But these people are men of like passions with ourselves, and there is much in their ways which you will admire when you know them better* The places you see, although hot, barren, and quite unlike home, are full of interest if you look at them with understanding. The countries bordering the Persian Gulf have a great and growing international importance; and, in travelling to these countries, you have an opportunity which many people who must stay at home would envy: but to make the most of this opportunity you must Ionov; something of what goes on around you. Such knowledge will enable you to avoid giving offence and. perhaps, making a fool of yourself. In many places the people have seen so few British and Americans that they judge our entire nations by the behaviour of the few they meet. Always remember that you are, in this sense, an ambassador of your country, Don*t start with the idea that the Persian Gulf is Persian; it isn’t. More than half its shore-line belongs to various Arab States and less than half to Persia; and the Gulf itself, although the strait joining it to the Indian Ocean is only twenty-nine miles wide, is a part of the high seas and therefore free for all beyond the limits of territorial waters, _ who gu Mur living nvi thid b' o y • .Uprrafr &amp; n -Gu]-P ,, ..a nd 1 = 31 : -Lulk-xiliUUt- ftnir ru-Uiiiriz; £i,ahj - dhft 1 this pOFtorps: 5E trs th** esTtfrefri.^-Uy nrritimc- \r- m i tinv.-m.iuim-iu. ii-'vi Mi,., dill the past we regarded its waters as a highway for our ships, and to-day we regard its air as a highway for our aircraft: its shores we have always regarded, and still regard, as the property of those who live on them. During the two centuries when Britain has been the paramount ¥estern Power in these waters she has undertaken no conquests. Not only is the Persian Gulf a highway between East and West and the front door to JFbrsia, Iraq, and the States of North-Eastern Arabia, but it is an important racial and political frontier. On one sid^of it are the Persians, on the other the Arabs - different peoples* speaking different languages, with different ideals and ways of life; and they belong to different religious sects. It is essential, for one who has to live and mix with them to have some idea of these differences, and we shall return to the subject later. Finally, the Persian Gulf is important as the site of oil^fields present and future. Up to date the volume of oil from the G^f area is small in comparison with American or Russian output; but oilrfields are not inexhaustible, and the time may come when the exhaustion of fields elsewhere may give the oil of the Persian Gulf a greatly increased significance. Properly to understand the present set-up it is necessary to know a little of the history of the Gulf, and this you will find in the next chapter. II. EARLY HISTORY The first Europeans to be seen in force in the Persian Gulf were Greeks, Three hundred years before Christ that remarkable jixin Alexander the Great marched an army of Macedonians and Greeks to the conquest of India, but, finding the country larger end hotter than they liked, they decided to come home by way of the Gulf. Alexander, with part of the /armyEB - 2 - / XiiDIV anmy, marched from near Karachi through southern Persia to the Basra area; while another detachment, under his admired Noarchus/'sailed with the heavy equipment in 1,800 small and unsafe ships along the north shore of the Gulf. ' The jourhey took them from early .November 326 B*C* t 6 late February 325 B,C., and from what has been.recorded of their ^ experiences it may be -inferred that none of them was keen to repeat it* ' Nevertheless, Alexander sent expeditions to explore .the south shore of the Gulf and, when he died* in 323 B.p.before over he reached home• had ordered'Nearchus to try to sail round Arabia to, Suez. • da';; The next 'on the scene w r ere the Portuguese and it was .apparently pepper that brought them. Our European ancestors of the Mddle Ages seem to have had a rare fondness for pepper and other spices from the East, and for these they were prepared to pay well. Persia,. Jmdia and- China, also produced finely manufactured goods, silks and brocades, the demand for yhich was possibly created by our ancestors’ wives: the demand was certainly furious. These things had to find their way to the Mediterranean- either overland, through the Persian Gulf, or through the Red Sea, and the cost of transporting them was so high tha£ .it.was .soon realised that a fortune awaited anyone who could operate an all-sea routs to India.- The Portuguese were the first to achieve it, and- Vasco da Gama’s voyage round the Cape of Good Hope to India in 14?8 was one'of. f the most significant events in all 'the history of the,-East. The Portuguese then planned to send their ships to India- to fetch the merchandise and to stop the trade up the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea which was, at the time, being profitably carried; on by .^rab merchants, ihe first thing the inoffensive? Arab merchants knew was the arrival of the Portuguese Admiral Affonso .^^^Buquerque, at the head of a squadron G 't warships, at Ras at Hadd, the east^rmost corner of Arabia. It is difficult to improve on the oldest -account of his proceedings there «• • xind they found there ...30 or AO fishing ships, which were come thither irom the city of Ormuz, Galayate, and all that caast to fish...~and they burned all these ships, and on the following morning- set sail with a fair wind, and took the ships* boats with masts and sails.' nfc Quraiyat, ' farther up the coast, 'he was ill received and,, storming the town, met with a vigorous opposition, but entered with tho death of 80 of the enemy and loss of three Portuguese; after the plunder the place was burnt, an. with it 14 vessels' that were in the harbour. Hence he sailed eight leagues further to’ Mascabe..,' • So it went on - and we should i?emember thatthiSjwasthe Arab’s first introduction to Christian Europeans. Finally H Albuquerque captured-Hormuz, which 'must then have been very different from the unimpressive ruins .which may still be seen on the island of that name near Bandar *ibbas, ^iccording to writers -pf the time* it was as bigge as Exeter, the buildings faire and spacious. .. u -and doing more trade in its best days than London and Amsterdam combined' ; and Milt 6 ft-wrote of 'The ;wealth of Ormuz and of Ind.n During nearly a hundred years while they had things imeh their own way x except for some Turkish opposition from the direction of Iraq, the -Portuguese built forts along the Batinacoast, at Muscat, Hormuz, .and Bahrein, dominating completely the trade, and politics of the Persian.: Gulf, while the Pbpe confirmed their^ King in his title of 'Lord of the Conquest, Navigation and Commerce of India, Ethiopia, Arabia, and Persia*” Possibly’it was too much accent on the 'Conquest!’-and ftot enough oft the.,'Cpnraerce' which made tne prosperity of Hormuz 'decline under their management and, mare serious, brought upon them the disapproval of one of the greatest men who ever rulePersia - shah Abbas, In 1602 he drove them from Bahrein and in J-bzO irom a position they o ccupied' near.Ras, A1 Khaima on the Trucial Coast - ^ in^the years between he established a'new port, which he named Bandar aboas after Himself, as a rival to Hormuz. . During the same years various en erprisxng Englishmen took advantage of the security prevailing throughout Persia under Shah Abbas to visit his Court, and the Ring of Spain (who had ubjugated Portugal in 158o) sent a succession of priests to represent S’ 1111 * 11 Ghah Abbas, however, did not holdWith priests and wrote to the rang that He was weaxy of receiving Friers as ^Imbassadors 13 and asking to bo sent 'some Spanish Gentleman of Note' instead, 'for he should know /betterbetter how to treat with such a one, and God and His Majesty would be better serVed, because a religious man out of his cell was like a fish out of water* H The Shall got his Spanish Gentleman of Note, who ^peremptorily demanded the restitution of certain places lately conquered by the Persians, and the exclusion of the English and all other Europeans from the Persian trade. “This was too much for the Shah, who tore up ^ the letters and swore that, so far from restoring what he had already taken, he would drive the Portuguese from their fortress at Hormuz; while he ordered a Farman to be made out granting the sole trade in silks by the sea route to the English'. ^ The Shah kept his word, but, since then, hundreds of Europeans have repeated the Spaniard*s mistake* Never try, like the Spanish Gentleman of Note, to be high-handed with the Persians* Rather typically, it was a* large consignment of unsaleable broadcloth that first brought the British to Persia, but to make the matter clear it is necessary to go back a little. The defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1388 made the English realise that there was no reason to continue letting the Spanish and Portuguese monopolise such a good thing as the Eastern trad®, and in the year 1600 Queen Elizabeth was pleased to grant a charter to 'The Governor and Company of the Merchants of London trading into the East Indies', who proceeded to establish a trading-post or '’factory' at Surat on the west coast of India, Their object was 'by fair means to obtain a quiet and peaceable trade,' but the Portuguese saw fit to interfere and had to be defeated in two sea-battles off Surat in 1612 and 1615* -ii-nd so we get back to our broadcloth, which was then England*s chief article of export. The Company were at their wits’ end to know how to dispose of a large consignment of it which had arrived at Surat, and which the Indians (and you can hardly blame them, considering the climate) showed no eagerness to buy* The Gonpaigr thought they saw light when they heard from a traveller that in Persia they might be assured 'of the vente of much cloth, in regard their country is much cold, and men, women, and children are clothed therewith some five months of the year'i and they established their first 'factory' in Persia at Jask, with others at Shiraz and Isfahan* The Portuguese Fleet, of course, interfered again and was defeated in a hot battle off Jask in 1620* In 1622 the British did an odd thing. The Persians, who wore besieging Hormuz with a land army (Shah .abbas was keeping his word to the Spanish ajjnbassador) and much needed help from the sea, demanded with threats and promises the assistance of a British Fleet which happened to be nearby* Although England and Spain were at pea.ce the Company agreed, and the Fleet joined forces with the persiajis to drive out the unfortunate Portuguese* The Persians took the lion’s share of the loot and practical^ demolished Hormuz, which never again raised its head; but Portuguese power in the Gulf was broken and the English opened a 'factory' at Bandar Abbas, which remained the centre of their activities in the Gulf for 150 years. There was one relieving feature of the incident, of a nature unusual at that time* In the words of a Pbrtuguese historian, 'The English Captains have performed their promise made upon yield-up of the Castle, by giving two of their own ships or pinasses to carry away all the people whither they would goe, also by defending them that at no time neither Moor nor Infidell should do them any hurt* ••and more, they have given hospitality to our sick and wounded, which are neere about two hundred at the least, whom they have sustained and cured with as groat care and diligence as if they had boene their own brothers*' The British, however, were far from being out of the wood: during the succeeding years they had to compete with the far more formidable rivalry of the Dutch East India Company which had also established itself at Bandar Abbas. The Dutch proved astute traders, and, as their Coiipaiy was run as a State enterprise with the whole-hearted backing of the Government, they soon drew ahead of the English Company, which was a private undertaking with lukewarm Government support* The conduct of the Persians was exasperating to both Dutch and English, and the Dutch in 1650 used force to coerce them* This, though it temporarily increased /theirtheir ascendancy, redounded to their disadvantage in the long run, for the Persians did not forget it. The position of the English Company was strengthened about 1700 by the amlgaraation with it of various competi^ companies end by more determined Government support, and with the turn cf the century came the turning-point in their fortunes. This was sifnxalised^ m a typically Oriental manner - the Shah of Persia decided to honour tlf'' British factory” at Isfahan with a State visit. 'Mr. Bruce, the Company’ s ^agent, and all the factory, great and small, were ordered to leave oheir house and chamber doors and warehouses all open, for His Majesty and his Seraglio companions to ramble thro*, and take such things as best pleased him and his minions; and there was a table left in the Dining Room spread with the richest sweetmeats and fruit. I believe the Company was not very ambitious of having such honours conferred on them, since they were obliged to pay for th©ml n Twelve thousand pounds the bill came to, out, in spite of this, the Dutch tried their best to secure a similar honour from the Shah, and failed. The Shah‘s goodwill proved v;ell worth the money and British fortunes forged ahead, but unfortunately it was not long before Persia entered on a period of anarchy, so that ™!L_J raCL ^ for nearly a hundred lean years it seemed hardly worth while hanging on. The French, too, established themselves at Bandar Rob as, and although they never proved dangerous rivals in trade they caused serious inconvenience during the periodic wars of the eighteenth century. The Bandar .abbas factory was closed down in 1763 and another opened at Bushire, while, for a few years in the interval, Basra was the centre of British commercial activity. About this time the competition of the Dutch finally faded out as they tended to con centrate their attention more on their Par Eastern possessions, and since then the British have remained the paramount power in the Persian Gulf* The story of what they have done and have not done^ during these hundred and eighty years must form another chapter. III. 'THE MOST UNSELFISH PaGE IN HISTORY...»» 1^1763, when Britain found herself alone in the field of commercial enterprise, the G-ulf was in a state of chaos, uncharted and uhbuoyed, and infested by pirates and the roving war—fleets of arab potentates. For many years relations between Persia and the ^rabs had been governed by 'The ancient law, the siiiple plan. That he shall take who hath the power, And he shall keep who can', and, roughly oetveen the years 1600 and 1700, the Persians had done the taking, -at various times they had occupied nearly all the Arab coast 1 rom Basra to Muscat, but as disorders in x^ersia increased, their hold on these places slipped, and from about 1700 the irabs controlled the entire south shore and dominated parts of the Persian coast, notably the Lihgeh^ corner. It was therefore the .Vrabs who provided the British authorities with most of their problems, and the first problem was piracy. The men of the Persian Gulf in general and of the Pirate Coast (now Trubial Coast ) in particular had long been notorious for piracy so that no ship oi any nationality, unless heavily armed or convoyed, was safe any where between India and Africa, The story of the pirates will be told in the section on the Trucial Coast, but here it is just necessary to mention that the East India Company sent an expedition against them in 1809, and a little later a Turko-Egyptian army under Mohammed Ali pasha, an iHbanian soldier who had risen to become Viceroy of Egypt under the Turks and from whom the present King of Egypt is descended, advanced against the Wahhabi from the west. The Wahhabi were the followers of a puritan reformer named Mahammed ibn Abcjal Wahhab, who set out to clean up Islam. They were Bedouins of central Arabia, tough, savage, fanatical, and recklessly brave, and their hand was turned as much against other Muslims who disagreed with their ideas as against Christians. They captured the port of Qatif in 1800 and their hold soon spread to the whole Ji-rab shore of the G-ulf, whose inhabitants found it convenient to / conform *r EB -5- conf«&gt;nn to their tenets* j.'J.though the Wahhabi were corxiandecl by their great leader the -uidr Sa»ud, ;mcestor of the present Kin.i of Saudi Arabia, the Egyptians overman their country and reached the Persian G-ulf at ^ Haea in 1818* ^rthis tune the British, who had boon too lenient with the pirates after their first expedition, found themselves compelled to send another, and they deputed one of their officers, an Irish captain a called Sadleir, to secure the co-operation of the Egyptians, When Sadleir reached Hasa he discovered that the'Egyptians, who found .^rabia too large, turbulent and barren to hold, had already begun to withdraw westwards, but his orders were to contact them, so he followed* The farther he went the farther they retreated until, after untold difficultis and dangers, he cane out on the shores of the Red Sea, his horse dying under him just as he arrived* His crossing of Arabia, alone and at that date, is a feat of courage and endurance which deservos to be remembered* The expedition (undertaken, of course, without any help from the Egyptian) was successful, and a general Treaty of peace was signed in 1820 by which the .nraos bound themselves to abandon piracy ,T against any nation whatsoever*' Britain thus won security for the ships of all nations trading to the Persian Gulf* In the succeeding years British officials applied themselves to eliminating the perpetual sea-warfare prevailing between the Arab tribes, and a Treaty of Peace in Perpetuity was signed in 1853* This provided for the cessation of all wantlike acts at sea, victims of aggression being required not to retaliate but to report the matter to the British authorities, and was an immense boon to all concerned* With what the Arabs did to each other on land Britain did not concern herself, but the peace at sea has continued unbroken to this day, Britain’s next problem was the slave trode. She had herself taken a leading part in it at one time and, as was fitting, she took the lead in suppressing it, starting as early as 1772* The law of the Qur’an permits the enslavement of non—Muslim prisoners of war v/ho refuse to become Muslims, and the lav/ of-the Qur , an is the law of the ^rab States o.t the Persian Gulf to this day. This condition, however* ^vas frequently disregarded and for centuries persons other than prisoners of war were enslaved, especially persons of African origin. The Qur’an also enjoins that slaves should be well fed and clothed, given wives, and kindly treated, and that the freeing of slaves is an act in the sight of God, about a hundred years ago the .^rabs were accordingly importing annually in sailing-vessels from ad'rica perhaps as many as 10,000 African^ whose descendants may be seen to-day swarming in any port of the Gulf, In 1320 there was an anti-slavery clause inserted in the Genera.1 Treaty of Peace, but it remained a dead letter in the absence of means to enforce it. Since then Britain has gradually tightened up her preventive measures by her treaties with Persia, Turkey (who controlled Iraq until 191A)&gt; as well as with the Arabs, until to-day the slave trade in the Persian Gulf is virtually dead* I said the slave trade, not slavery: many of the persons of African blood (pure or diluted) you see are still slaves, but they may not be bought or sold and can have their freedom at any time they asx for it at a British Political agency or on board any British warship* Only those who are born of slave parents and who choose of their own iree will to stay on in their master's house need remain slaves, but this is a large number* Arab masters would often gladly bo ^ rid of the idle slaves whom tradition compels them to support; and • domestic slavery has almost entirely ceased in Kuwait, Bahrein, and f Muscat, Elsewhere it frequently happens that a slave, v/ho after a tiff wita his mastey^ has come to the Political Agent and demanded his freedom, spends ^ a fev/ weeks earning his living as a free man in a world of free competition, and then returns to his master* be/rffimr to be taken bank 4flr.. I.ha-m 111 1 ' 1 hjuliT-*','-- , - : *r* account of the suppression of the slave trade in these waters would be oomptnte which, did not mention the /untiringP EB - 6 - selfless efforts of the men of the Royal Navy and the Royal Indian Navy who, for scores of years, under terrible climatic and livi^ conditions, -maintained the cea^ess patrol which did more than any tre^y in making all efforts to ship slaves simply not worth while. During the nineteenth century a cable and (later) a wireless system through the Gulf was established linking India with Europe and providing inte^Joirmunication between the Persian and nrab coastal ports. At the same time the Gulf was accurately surveyed by personnel of the Royal and Royal Indian Navies and a series of charts prepared which have since proved an inestimable boon to the shipping of all nations* The same may be said of the establishment of lighthouses and the placing of buoys wherever required, and of the preparation and publication of tide tables. Public health was also a primary concern of the British Authorities, and statistical and meteorological information was collected. Quarantine arrangements were made at all the larger ports so that the incidence of plague was much diminished and the scourge of cholera banished fffcrm the Persian Gulf. The island of Kharg (north-west of Bushire) was occupied from 1838 to 1842 and again in 1856^7 course of hostilities which broke out between Great Britain and Persia, during which the British also took Bushire and Khorramshahr (then called MuhammerAh) and sent an army as far as Ahwaz. At this time the Turks, who controlled Iraq, also claimed a shadowy suzerainty over Kuwait, Hasa and Qatar. Lord Curzon summed up Britain’s position at that time in a speech to the Trucial Chiefs in 1903: 'Sometimes I think that the record of the past ■j is in danger of being forgotten We saved you from extinction at the hands of your neighbours. We opened these seas to the ships of all , nations and enabled their flags to fly in peace. We have not seized or held your territory* We have .not destroyed your independence, but have preserved it. Me are not now going to throw away this century of costly and triumphant enterprise; we shall not wipe out the most unselfish page in history *,.The peace ef these waters must still be maintained; your independence will continue to be upheld; and the influence of the British Government must remain supreme. 1 ' Although this may read a trifle bombastically now, and we should be inclined to a modification, or at least to a less forthright expression, of these opinions, the position then was different. \/hat amounted to an international rush for the Persian Gulf was in progress. 'The French, whose status in Muscat was nominally identical with that of Great Britain, desired to secure a ooaling station there in 1893; Russia, in the endeavour to enlarge her sphere of influence, sent various missions thither, ostensibly to establish a ‘worm-water port’ to serve as a constant outlet for her trade, and heavily subsidised a line of steamers from the Blade Sea; Turkey^ assumed control of the States on the western littoral, claiming suzerainty over Hasa and Bahrein and even Oman, and endeavouring to bring within her orbit the long—autonomous principality of Kuwait; while Germany, in pursuance of her Oriental policy and the realisation of her dream of a through route from Hamburg to the Persian Gulf, spared no pains to obtain a solid footing under the guise of commercial expans ion. ..Z 1 ^There was, at the time, a flourishing trade in modern rifles from Muscat across the Gulf to South 'Persia, whence they reached wa^pMke Afghan tribes, who used them to disturb the peace of British Ihclia, and most of Persia and Arabia was armed from the same source. Many of these arms arrived in French ships, and the protection of the French flag was used, too, by many of the dhows engaged in the slave trade. All those causes of friction were eradicated by the establishment of the Entente Cordiale with France, and rivalry 'with Russia abated after the signing of the Anglo—Russian Convention of 1907 which constituted the Persian Gulf a British sphere of influence. In 1914 a British army passed through the Persian Gulf to Iraq, where it fought a prolonged and arduous campaign resulting in the /liberation ✓EB -7- liberation of that country from Turkish domination and its establishment as an independent Arab State* Meat of East Persia was occupied too as % preliminary to the formation of a cordon to prevent German agents infiltrating from Turkey into Afghanistan with the object of instigating , that country to attack India* This gave the Germans an opportunity of playing on Persian patriotism, and their agent Wassmuss succeeded in ^ raising the jashgai tribe in the hinterland of Bushire and in diverting the best part of a division of British troops, an exploit which others of their agents -krivs endeavoured to emulate in war* It is now time to turn to the Persian Gulf as it is to-day, and, to keep the distinction clear, we will deal with Persia and the .-^rab States separately, but before doing so it would perhaps be as well to explain the system of political control which has been evolved* ^ /a / _ The chief representative of/British interests is the Political Kesiaent in the Persian Gulfj,c There are adso^Consuls at Khorramshahr, Bushire, and Bandar Abbas, with a British Consular Agent at Lingeh* On the iirab side he controls Political Agents at Kuwait, Bahrein, and Muscat, and, subordinate to the Political Agent at Bahrein, a Political Officer on the Trucial Coast* These Political .agents are nothing to do with elections* They are the representatives of the British ojid Indian Governments in the territories to which they are posted, and discharge the functions of Consuls besides doing many things which an ordinary I Consul does not have to do* As it is obviously not desirable that Europeans ond^ Americans should have to submit to Arab Courts and Qur’anic law, all foreigners are (by treaty with the various rulers) subject to the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the Political Agent* Joint Courts consisting of the Political Agent and the Sheikh, or, for minor cases, of the Assistant Political Ag©nt and one of the Sheikh*s relations, are held to try cases in which foreigners and the Sheikh*s subjects are both involved* .i-t-,.&gt;. i..r -ruiai ] -jj-i r •■ni-|-|-- r -itjr Tuvirr.rtrin?. furai-gu 'TAfUt.UvJ. i l , i vnr .u 1 . ..uu.l dort guide la i -4/idn, hn.yinrl hl'n'i-iAaipr uj?—trLiudTPW'u# Ivfembcrs of the Allied Forces should only have dealings with the local authorities through the political Agent, who is best aole to ensure that the maximum of co-operation is secured from the Arabs while their rights and susceptibilities are respected by hrAna-£rixlau-^i-'^. f -rn ri t,r L o Arsil'i m ^r.y Iinri Vrr fliiVilih npl'.i=nrL:.-fahna - ri . t [.u | i n&lt;n Apart from oil, the foreign trade of the Gulf is mostly with Bombay, and the great majority of British subjects living in the Gulf are Indians* For these reasons, as well as for historical ones, the Political Officers are members of the Indian Political Service, appointed from India, and | the policy they follow is the joint product of the Government of India and Whitehall* The fact that some have military rank while others do not merely shows that they entered the Service from the Army and not from the Indian Civil Service - plain Mr* may actually hold a more responsible post than Major, here as elsewhere* IV. THE PEESI.H SHORE, The Persians are an Aryan race and speak an Aryan language. This means that their language is similar to European languages and not to Arabic and Turkish, and that they^joossibly come of the same race as European nations* jAthough overtfrun at various tiines by Mongols, Tartars, Turks, Arabs and Afghans, the Persians have never been submerged: they have kept their language, traditions, and culture alive and have always absorbed their conquerors. Their language is a good one and has progressed linguistically much further than many European languages, but in the Middle Ages Persia adopted the Arabic writing, and with it many Arabic words* This has made Persian much more difficult for us to learn and understand, but it is still worth learning. It has a store of poetry of a high order, and some of the ancient Persian poets have been translated into irany of the languages of Europe* The Persians are proud of their origin and justly proud of /their# ( 2 &lt;o /' 9 - y&amp;miv ^ to Shiraz, and, in consequence, the port of Bttshire had flourished at the expense of Bandar Abbas* During tho last 10 years or so it has been the turn of Bus hire to decline in favour of Bandar Ohahpur, and, more recently Khorramshahi^which have better harbours, and the trade of Persia has been concentrated at the head of the Gulf. In addition, burdensome customs ✓ regulations and the abuses of petty officialdom far from the control of Tehran have made the lot of traders in the Gulf ports of Persia ** difficult, and the ports themselves present a dismal picture of depression and decay* Many of the merchants and thousands of shopkeepers, artisans and labourers have emigrated to the -urab side, where freedom from irksome restrictions and Government control makes life easier, and they have taken much of the trade with them* For instance, the market in pearls (the most important export, after oil, from the Gulf) has been entirely transferred from Lingeh to Dibai and other -rab ports, which have benefited immensely* Abadan presents a vivid contrast* This island, near the head of the Gulf, houses the largest oil refinery in the world* It receives its crude oil supplies by pipe-line from the producing fields of the interior and, in 1938 , exported and sold over 9 x million tons of oil, on which the Persian Government received over £3,300,000 in royalty payments* The concession in which the oil fields are situated was granted to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co* in 1901, itls lease was re-negotiated in 1933* and expires in 1993* The industry is now Persia* s greatest after agriculture, and employs about 1,600 British and over 30,000 Persian personnel* Every effort is being made to associate Persians more and more in the work and management of the Company, and they already fill many responsible positions. , V. THE -JRiiB SHORE, l The ^rabs are culturally and linguistically distinct from the Persians* It is not surprising that the culture they have developed in their eiipty, burning deserts is quite distinct from that produced eynidf/Y green fields and teeming townsj but the civilisations of which we and the Persians are so proud owe much more to Arab thought and ideas than many of us realise* The Semitic language group has given the world its great monotheistic religions -^Judaism, Christianity, and Islam** The idea that there could be only one God was theirs. Jesus Christ was a Semite and spoke a language akin to Arabic* They gave us other things, too* In the Dark xxges they learnt and improved upon the scientific knowledge of the Greeks and, to some extent of the ancient Hindus, passing it on to Europe through their academies of learning in Baghdad and Egypt, as well as Muslimt Spain and Sicily* This knowledge was the seed from which our modem science has grown* Arab ideas and Arab dress are well suited to their climate, and they have the sense to realise^that, as they cannot change their climate, they would gain nothing by ap^ng the habits of Europe. The ^rab has no inferiority complex vis—a—vis tho European* He realises, of course, that the westerner iiae many material possessions that he has to do without, but he reflects that the Christian will roast in Hell for all eternity while the i'Aislim will be luxuriating in Heaven* Considering that he has the best of the bargain he feels pity for us rather than envy* ^ The ^irabs never forget that all men are equal in the sight of God and this makes them as democratio as any people on earth* There is no word for 'mister' in desert Arabic - it simply is not needed* A Bedouin with a rag round his stomach and an income of a few gallons of camel* s milk per annum will address a Sheikh worth hundreds of thousands of poundsp oj&amp;J EB ~lO [ITSOT' a year, or even a King, by his first name, v.dthout any title* .ji ^irab ruler is intensely sensitive to public opinion, and in any case will take ^ no important step without consulting an informal council composed of the leading members of his family, which often includes women? Succession in the leadership of a tribe does not necessarily go from father to ^ eldest son; a generation may be skipped or a younger son chosen in place of an elder if the greybeards of tiie tribe think it advisable* Indeed-*, it was possibly this custod which caused the great split in Islam betwe^T Sunnis (in^rabia ^ Turkey) and Shiahs (in Persia), Y/hen the prophet dohammed died the Arabs thought it perfectly natural to choose three of his elderly companions to succeed him in turn before choosing his son-in-law^ and nearest relative, hvLi. The Persians, with their rigid ideas of kingship and succession, thought that hYLi was the only rightful successor, Shiahs and Sunnis have been at loggerheads ever since and the question still hasn’t been decided. i, Iraq, /i tr /r t as a+K^***^ kt/LLcJI JthAsta.. Iraq, like Persia, has^oeen It was a country of 25,000,000 people when the Mongols captured Baghdad in 1097 and destroyed the system of canals by which the country lived. It has never regained its former prosperity and now has only about 4,000,000 inhabitants,' Its seaboard is small, eut about 75 miles up the Shatt al nrab river lies Basra which at one time was by far the largest port in the Persian Gulf Iv/o Hundred and sixty steamers docked there in 1938, and the Basra Port authority now maintains all the buoys and lighthouses in the Gulf, Large oil reserves have been proved by the Iraq Petroleum Co. at their Kirkuk field, discovered in 1928 , but the Company’s crude oil production is at present limited to four million tons per annum, which is the existing capacity of the twin pipe-lines to Haifa and Tripoli. ilfter oi]* Iraq’s largest export is of dates and these are exported from Basra. In fact, Iraq and the area of south-west Persia near the head of the Gulf Produce t ogeth er no less than 80 per cent of the world’s supply of dat^ 5 i Ln^l^Jr 145,000 tons were shipped from’Gulf ports?

Kuwait, In Arabic Al Kuwait means 'the little fort,” and its people have always tried to maintain the State as a little fortress between its powerful neighbours, Iraq and Saudi ^rabia. Shortly after the foundation oi the town about 1750 it served as a refuge for a large part of the population of Basra when the latter was conquered by the Persians in 1776, and, at the same time, much of the trade of central Arabia was diverted to Kuwait. When the ^rabs won back Basra in 1779 tnary of the refugees stayed on in Kuwait, attracted no doubt by the superior climate i-nd excellent harbour, and thus the foundation of the town’s prosperity was laid. To protect his country against Bedouin raids and minor foreign encroachments, the ruler, Sheikh Sir Ahmed .J. Jabir .BL Sabah, K.C.I.E., C.S. 1 ., has six Lewis guns mounted on trucks, 150 trained soldiers armed with .303 rii les, and 80 armed police. But every .urab considers himself ^oldie 2 ^ and trie town walls could probably be manned by 6,000 amed men and boys in an emergency, while larger numbers of Bedouin tribesmen would come forward for trie defence of the State. But against major aggression the Kuwaitis rely on the protection of the British Government and on the fact that their neighbours have promised the British to respect the integrity and independence of Kuwait, The Sheikh comes of a branch of tne Utub section of the ^inaizab tribe of central ^irabia, to which section the Sheikhs of Bahrein also belong. It is his own responsibility to rule ft Though it may well be again the largest port, at the moment iChorramshahr has a far larger capacity. /o ^7\\K -ll- yjr&amp;fT? in accordance with the wishes and best interests of his people^ ^ 1 '■ |! ’’’-‘‘'-‘'I'l ■; -hi'Kiy 'na -nrin lirinmti fir 1 dai hjida.. 10 j rnl{f ruia locin.o tn.tum lu.j.t. ual#- He Has accordingly formed an Advisory /^s Council of fourteen members to help him in the government. In 1914 and again^in 1939 the Sheikh placed his 'efforts, his men, and iris ships at the disposal of the Government of Great Britain.” The State is largely desert and there is practically no agriculture \n.th the result that malaria is almost unknown and the inhabitants are more robust than would otherwise be tire case. ^vs a result of the winter rains a large ^ area is covered with grass in the spring and early summer and the Bedouin come in from the desert to graze their flocks on the new vegetation* Apart from the produce of these flocks nearly all food and other necessities of life have to be imported - even drinking water is brought by ooat from Bao in Iraq. Kuwait exports in return little of value except pearls, and lives on the profits of her shipbuilding industry, trade, and the earnings of her deep-sea sailor’s. ^nab sailing ships known as ’'booms” (with pointed stems) and ’'oambuqs'(v/ith square f tG ^L are ? uilt there &gt; some 6 o of these fit for long journeys and up to 300 tons ourden are normally maintained, as well as several hundred V7 Pearling boats.

The drabs tell a story of his justice: Ono of them cmx to his court reported thit he had seen two bags of grain lying in the desert. 'How did you know that the bags contained grain?' asked the King# 'I touched them with my finger,” said the ^rab. '¥ith which finger?' asked the King.

To this day they number only a few hundred families afa belogg to the Sunni sect, whereas their predecessors, the Baharina, belong to the opposition Shiah sect and number some 50*000 ^ r- half the population of the islands.

Output in 1938 was over a million tons, and the industry employs 5&gt;000 local people and is the main stay of the island*s prosperity. Under a clause in their contract the company must employ locals for whatever skilled work they ene capable of, and they have accordingly founded a technical school where the youth of the island may acquire the necessary skilly. ^fter oil, pearling is the most important industry, and Bahrein is one of the centres of the world* s pearl trade. Unlikely as it may seem, the sea is warm enough for deop diving only from June to September, and at the end of May about 400 boats with 15,000 divers leave for the banks. No modern apparatus is used; the diver just fastens a clip to his nose, takes a mesh bag in one hand and a stone in tho other, and goes down - sometimes as deep as ten fathoms. He gathers in the bag as many oysters as he can find in a minute or so, and then comes up for a couple of minutes’ rest, hanging on to a pole at the side of the boat. after about ten dives he comes out of the water for a longer rest. It is very exhausting work, particularly as only light meals can be eaten, and those not more than twice a day. In the evening the divers sit round and open the oysters. Each boat pools its catch and every man from the captain to the cabin-boy gets his share according to old-established custom. Some of the best pearls in the world are found in the Gulf and the annual value of Bahrein* s catch is sometimes over a. million pounds sterling. Most of the pearls are bought by Indian merchants and refold in Bombay, whence, in peace time, the pearls for the European ‘marked found their way to Paris. The pearl trade is so vital for the prosperity of the Arabs that any Arab who prejudiced it by introducing artificial or cultured pearls into the Gulf would be lucky if he escaped with his life, while tho British authorities have always sternly discouraged attempts by European interlopers to exploit the pcarling-banks by using modem methoda. Although fresh water fro' 1 , the highlands of central Arabia, passing under hundreds 'of miles of desert and under the sea, wells up in Bahrein and in the sea around it, the island grows little besides dates and lucerne, and not nearly enough of these for its require' onts. Except for fish, all food and other necessities of life have to co n fro 1 abroad and are paid for with the profits from oil and pearls. The island also enjoys a lucrative entrepot trade, as most ol the imports and exports of Hasa pass through it. Going eastwards down the Gulf the jurisdiction of the Political Agent, Bahrein, extends to the peninsula of Qatar and to Trucial Oman, usually known as the Trucial Coast, Qatar is the , *sterile promontory** 100 miles long by 50 miles broad lying immediately south-east ox Bahrein. Sheikh Abdullah bin Jasim A1 Thani, C.I.E., of the Utub tribe, whose capital is at Doha on the east coast, rules about 30,000 settled inhabitants and exorcises a shadowy suzerainty over the Bedouin who cone and go between the interior of his State end Saudi ierabia. The people are primitive in the extreme, and their views on world affairs may bo summed up by saying that they don’t like foreigners, and particularly the Turks, who occupied their country up to 1925» They live largely by fishing and pearl—diving, sending / out- 14 - out a of sone 800 boats each year carrying 13^000 divers, hu . 1 ^ their future lies in oil* In 1933 the Sheikh granted the Single-Iranian Oil Covyany a 73 - 3 ^ 0 ar concession, which was subsequently transferred to Petroleu . Developnent (Qatar) Ltd., a company associated with the Iraq^ Petroleum Company G-roup* Developi.X)nt work began in 1937 and has resulted in the discovery of oil in what promises to be large co ..tercial quantities* V. The Trucial Ooa.st The Trucial Coast begins at the south-east corner of Qatar and runs for 400 miles to the village of Sha’a . near the tip of the Has Hasandam peninsula. The mountainous head of the peninsula belongs to the Sultanate of muscat; then the Trucial Coast begins again at Dibba and runs so;ie 30 miles south to the border of l.iuscat territory at Murair. Reading from west to east along the coast lie the Trucial Sheikhdoms of nbu Dhabi, Dioai, Sharja, an, Uv.u al Q^liwain, Has al Khaima and Kalba. Besides thesc^ there are other Sheikhdoiis, such as Pujaira and Ba:.riyah, which, although they liave established themselves as independent of the larger Sheilchdo..is, are signatories to no truce and have no treaties with the British Government. Inland, practically no boundaries are agreed on, and the roving Bedouins pay allegiance to one Sheikh or to another - or to none at all - as the spirit moves them. To understand the rather complex position it is necessary to go back and look briefly at the exceedingly interesting histoiy of the Coast* In the past the people of the Pirate Coast (as it used to 00 ca.lled) have had four flourishing industries - piracy, slave-trading, gun-running^ and pearl-diving. The British, as the great Power most interested in the Gulf, found themselves compelled to put an end to the first three, and the Japanese nearly killed the last with their cultured parls in the years before the war. The history of British relations with the Coast in oneii early years is the history of the suppression of piracy. The piratical Arabs v/ere then known collectively as J 0 wa.sii. 1 is, from the family name of their Sheikhs, from whom the present-day Sheikhs of Sharja, Ras al Khaima and Kalba are descended. They made convincing pirates, as we read from contemporary descriptions - 'They.*, are called Joes knee; ^ but God preserve us from them, for they are monsters* Ineir occupation io piracy, and their delight murder; and to make it worse they^give you the most pious reasons for every villainy the}/' commit. They abide by the letter of the sacred volume, rejecting all commentaries and traditions, you ore their captive, and you offer all you possess to save your life, they say, ’Nol it is written in the Qua 1 an that it is unlawful to plunder the living, but we are not. prohibited in that sacred work from stripping the deadl * So saying, they knock you on the hea.d. But then, that is not so much their fault, for they are descended from a Houl, or monster, and act according to their nature. H But they had their virtues, as we read else where - 'The most undaunted bravery was certainly theirs. If taken, they sub lit ted with resignation to the fate they inflicted on others; and when they fell into the hands of the Persians, or any nations by which they were surrounded, they were never spared. After the destruction of one of their forts, several of them were brought on*board one of our ships as prisoners. While uncertain of their fate, and before their wounds were aressea, it was asked what treatment they anticipated. 'The same immediate death as we shoulc, have inflicted on you, had your fortune been ours’, was the stern ana characteristic reply.' At first, while they plundered ell local vessels indiscrii.iino.tely, they were careful to respect all foreign shipping, and British captains had the strictest orders never to provoke then in eny way; but, in 1797, ship was forcibly detained by the..: for two days. When no retaliation was forthcoming they grew bolder, and another British ship (from which they had previously borrowed the powder and shot necessary) was attacked. The British put up with this sort of thing until 1806 when the pirate fleet was blockaded at Qishm and forced to sue for peace. The owasi -iis /promisoaEB -15- pronised to restore captured vessels and 'to respect the flag and property of the Honourable East India Company and their subjects M ; but the lesson was not sharp enough and the attacks soon began again, and spread from the west coast of India to the Red Sea. A typical case was that of the 'Minerva” which, after a running fight of two days, was carried by boarding ^ 'The commander, with full knowledge of the cruel fate which awaited him, attempted to blow his vessel up, but unfoVtunately failed, and the slaughter of the victims commenced. The ship was first 'purified' with water and perfumes, and, this accomplished, the different individuals were bound and brought forward singly to the gangway, whore one of the pirates cut their throats, in the name of God.” The pirate fleet load by now grown to nearly 1,000 ships manned by over 19,000 Lien, and the East India Company decided to take active measures against them* An expedition accordingly sailed in 1809, which captured and burnt Ras al Khaima, with the pirate vessels in the port* Lingeh was treated in the same way, but the lesson was soon forgotten and piracy broke out again ten years later* Another expedition was sent, which did the job more thoroughly, and the pirate chiefs signed a General Treaty of Peace in 1820, which incidentally included an anti-slavery clause* This treaty, however, while outlawing piracy, did not prohibit inter-tribal warfare at sea, which, in practice, was almost the same thing, and in 1835 the chiefs were persuaded to sign a six-month maritime truce prohibiting all hostilities by sea* This enabled them to oarry on their pearl-diving without interruption and proved such a boon to all of thorn that they readily agreed to renew it annually until 1843 # then for ten years, and finally, in 1853, for ever* Since then the Pirate Coast has been known as the Truoial Coast, and the truce has remained substantially unbroken. The keynote of British relations with the Trucial Sheikhs was ^ J then, and still is to-day, 'You may do what you like on dry land, but you | may not fight or rob on the sea.” Since then Sharja and Dibai have become refuelling points on the air route to India, various other Sheikhs have agreed to allow emergency landing-grounds to be constructed and 'used in their territories, and the Government of India has provided a Post Office and dispensary in Dibai. Most of the Sheikhs have agreed to allow Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., to prospect for oil in their territories, but it is as well to remember that the presence of foreigners in their country is a novelty to which the local people must take time to become accustomed, and that we should take every care to make our impact on them as gentle as possible. The Sheikhs are independent Arab rulers in special treaty relations with the British Government, and they are jealous of their independence# British and other foreign interests are looked after by a Political Officer at Sharja, wuo is subordinate to the Political Agent at Bahrein, and, in his absence, by an Arab official known a.s the Residency Agent. The^State of Muscat lies, strictly speaking, outside the Persian Gulf, but it presents many points of similarity to the other Arab,States and cones within the sphere of the Political Resident. After Saudi Arabia it is the largest of the *j.rab States in population (500,000) and in area, consisting of the nountaincus promontory at the head of Ras Masandam, together with the coastal strip from Murair, 50 miles to the south, right round the comer to the province of Dhofar (capital, Solalah), half-way .along the south-eastern coast of Arabia* It is ruled by His Highness Sir Said bin Tainur, U.C.I.E., Sultan of Muscat card Oman.

Their armies carried their faith to India and Malaya in the east, Morocco and Spain in the west, the Balkans and central Asia in the north, and to Africa in the south# And for all these countries the Qur*an, the Muslin scriptures, provided a code of law and behaviour usually preferable to any they had had before# The central pillar of Islam is that there is only one God, and the making of pictures and images of joon or beasts is therefore forbidden, since man, in thus usurping the function of the Creator, cannot nevertheless imbue his creation with a soul# For this reason mosques as a rule are simple and austere, decorated only by texts from the -jur*an with geometrical motifs# Muslims must pray five times a da}'-, and must wash their laces, hands, end their feet before prayer; thev are forbidden to drink wine or to e..t?the flesh of pigs. For one month in the year f Ramadan) they may not eat, drink, or smoke between sunrise and sunset. They may have four wives at a thro, but only the very rich can. of ford to have mare tarn cm Muslims have many ritual duties i^id upon them# They hold that Jesus Christ and the Old Testament prophets woro true prophets, but that Mohammed, coming after them, modified and purified many of their teachings and is therefore to be followed where there is Giaagreenent# Homenber, when you see Muslims praying, that they are worshipping the same God &lt;*-&amp; we worship, and that they are very serious about ifc. Never interrupt thorn or pass near them. There is a tacit understanding in Arab countries that Christians hold to their own religion^ end respect that of the Muslims, and vice versa. Zurabs are sensitive about their religion and are quick to resent any real or imagined slight, so one must be careful not to--give _ offence and, unless one is on yery intimate toms, it is safest not to discuss religion with then# /Closely-P-W EB -17- 'wrT'nTTr ^ * U Closely bound up with religion is the question of women* Hus 1 in custom enjoins that women should conceal their faces from all men except their husbands and near relations, and this injunction is strictly followed by the ^rabs. (in Persia, however, the unveiling of women was ordered by the late 6 hah as part of his campaign to westernise the country, and the more well-to-do .^Persian women have adopted western dressj^ In some eastern countries the local women mix freely with European men, but this is emphatically not the case in Arabia, and even a glance or a word may be a serious matter* The Arabs are very jealous of the honour of their women and are quick to shed blood in defence of them, so that a man who has relations with a u#oman who is not his wife is often killed by her husband or brother: but still more often, it is the woman who is killed by her father or brother for bringing disgrace on the family* For a Christian to have dealings with a Muslim woman is the surest way of starting trouble - and serious trouble - for the affair is looked upon as an insult from one race to another and from one religion to another* Finally, the only Muslim women who would accommodate a Christian would be the lov/est type of prostitutes, and these are riddled with all known varieties of venereal disease* Yrtien meeting Arabs remember that they are generally much more leisurely than we are, so take your time when discussing business with them* Besides being unhurried, you should be quiet and dignified - boisterousness is considered very bad manners* Usually, in an Arab assembly, the seats farthest from the door are for the exalted, and those nearest the door for the lowly of station# It is good manners to remember the Biblical injunction and take a lowly seat* You will then be pressed to 'go up higher' and may, with becoming reluctance, comply* Normally, the visitor and the visited confine their conversation for the first few minutes to repeated formal Inquiries after each other’s health* Coffee and perhaps sweetmeats are then brought and business may be discussed* Two or three cups of coffee must be accepted and you should then shake the cup as you hand it back to the servant as a sign that you have had enough. Eat the food only with your right hand, never touch it with your left; among Easterners the left hand is reserved for unclean tasks end is never used for eating. You should not point the sole of the foot towards an Arab or stretch your legs out in front of you if you are sitting on the floor* In Kuwait and Iraq it is a sign that the guests should take their leave when the.host calls for the incense to be passed round, but the passing of incense does not have this significance farther down the Gulf. It is usually not xxjssible when receiving Arabs to arrange for all this ritual, but if a reputable -irab comes to see you he should always be offered a chair and any refreshment (except alcohol) that may be going* If you give him a meal, serve no pork in any form* Most i^rabs will not eat meat unless the animal, while still alive, lias had its throat cut to the accompaniment of prayer* ry You may have heard that Orientals are cunning and deqeitful, and some of them no doubt are, but remember that they have no monopoly of these failings; never attempt to employ these arts when dealing with them, or you will be in for trouble* They have come to expeot good faith and straightforwardness from us, and these will pay you boat* Politeness costs only a little effort and will pay big dividends in willing co-operation, and by treating the people among whom you live with courtesy and kindness and by showing every consideration for their point of view you will be doing your country a service* NOTE OK CURRENCY* 128 - 130 ri&lt;ols a £ 1 (standard Rate). 1 rial 3 100 dinars Bronze Coins: 5&gt;10,30 dinars.

In Saudi Arabia the currency unit is the silver dollar (rial), worth about Is, 2 d, but the rate fluctuates a lot. The rail is worth 22 piastres (girsh; plural, gurush) which are copper or nickel coins. There are silver coins representing ? rial and ^ rial, British gold sovereigns are also widely used and at present each sovereign is worth about 4-0 rials.

Te too thinii ■ the paper would be valuable for British business men and oil people going out to the G-ulf, although it might want some recast ing if it was to be made available to Americans. 2. But before we decide to print there is a consideration I ■' r r. «• r + - p; ,-| . &lt;-■ ; ; r- ' f-if Ar ■ - should particularly like to put forward. The policy in the Persian Gulf is directed by H.M.Gr. and the leading Department in the c c . o direction of that policy is the India Office. Business men going - r .- • # r ^ out from the U.K. to the Gulf are much more the concern of the o ■ ■ ’ ; - . i ■ o • r . Department of H.M.G. concerned in Gulf affairs than of the Govt, of India, and it is surely for you to decide whether something should be done to guide them, and if so in what form. It would • T •'!. ; • 1 ' . ‘ • r j i—f r-;V- p ' !; .• f &lt;■' C :■ [• v! follow that it is also for you to print and distribute papers of •t . I ‘ P £ r r ' , . , * _ .1 _ _ ... this kind, 3. You will remember that in a Re cent letter I made the suggestion that there were a number of matters of external interest 0 ■■ ■ r- p/ [ : p A f p, p ’ in which the India Office might undertake printing at home. It is r !- r often a waste of time, postage and postal space for us to print the material out here with the main object of its being used by you at home, and it does seem to me that there is a gap needing to be filled. All sorts of material in the Foreign Office receive wide circulation through blue prints, but there is little in that part of the foreign field that is peculiarly India’s interest thatthat has similar distribution, not even when we in India go through a laborious process dm printing here and despatch to you for distribution at home. The Persian Gulf is a good . ' ' ' ' n • • '..••• 4 o O' 1 instance of what I have in mind, for although India is much • r\ c, j , *. • ' v ' r \ *' • . concerned with its administration, the ultimate responsibility F &gt; r - very definitely does r not lie here. 4. ' I had better keep Tandy’s typescript until we have come to a conclusion, for we do not want to rule out the possibility ; r.-v r' : • r ' J r r ' r of printing here, if it is really thought that it is the right thing to do in spite of this definite opinion that it is not work for us at all. Ihen printing is undertaken, there will be a few small points in Tandy’s draft of which I shall suggest corrections, e.g. Nadir came to India 200 years ago and not 300; there might very well be some mention of the emptiness • . v. - f • of the Persian claim to Bahrain; the water in Bahrain is not fresh but brackish; the Americans would be flattered oy a reference to Villiers excellent book on the dhow tragic called, I think, ’’The Modern Sindbad”; I certainly should not quote Lord Gurzon so much in extenso, and so on; but all this : I can be settled later.

There is nothing greatly objectionable in this passage.but the words in brackets ”(or, with the frills off, •••••• thU* we have to)” might/might -oossihly cause the Arabs some slight This passage might therefore come out though I should leave in the rest down to the Allies . With Mr. Harrison’s concurrence I have amended the draft letter to the M. of I. accordingly. As for the disputed passage on pages 10 and 11, there is the further objection that it does not really give a true picture of what is in fact the position in Koweit. The Advisory Council was formed spme y® ar ® ago when trouble broke out among the Sheikhs subjects but he is now firmly in the saddle once more and the Council now exists only on paper. ■1— tear Dribex^ Thanfc you for your letters of 22nd Docoaber and ard January, 1 o.

You will find it difficult to understand where one country ends and the next begins, and who runs which* Most of all you will find the manners, customs, and ways of living odd and incomprehensible. But these people are men of like passions with ourselves, and there is much in their ways which you will admire when you know them better* The places you see, although hot, barren, and quite unlike home, are full of interest if you look at them with understanding. The countries bordering the Persian Gulf have a great and growing international importance; and, in travelling to these countries, you have an opportunity which many people who must stay at home would envy: but to make the most of this opportunity you must know something of what goes on around you* Such knowledge will enable you to avoid giving offence and, perhaps, making a fool of yourself. In many places the people have seen so few British and Americans that they judge our entire nations by the behaviour of the few they meet. Always remember that you are, in this sense, an ambassador of your country. Don’t start with the idea that the Persian Gulf is Persian; it isn’t. More than half its shore-line belongs to various Arab States and less than half to Persia; and the Gulf itself, although the strait joining it to the Indian Ocean is only twenty-nine miles wide, is a part of the high seas and therefore free for all beyond the limits of territorial waters. -—II? nhn cn 'OUl* li V xllg 01 trfr-i on fehc- shnre nr» ir i nrift 'jf tih'* ■ l| r nli ‘ 1 ~ M ' &lt;*■» n Xirrt-d-ti tin? !l mg t’niii‘oinn il'ul L' f ' f^U’Cr as— ■ \f n v*i -j „ p^..Tnnjn« I'!

Not only is the Persian Gulf a highway between East and West and the front door to Ibrsia, Iraq, and the States of North-Eastern Arabia, but it is an important racial and political frontier. On one side of it are the Persians, on the other the Arabs - different peoples speaking different languages, with different ideals and ways of life; and they belong to different religious sects* It is essential for one who has to live and mix with them to have some idea of these differences, and we shall return to the subject later* Finally, the Persian Gulf is important as the site of oilfields present and future. Up to date the volume of oil from the Gulf area is small in comparison with American or Russian output; but oilfields are not inexhaustible, and the time may come when the exhaustion of fields elsewhere may give the oil of the Persian Gulf a greatly increased significance. Properly to understand the present set-up it is necessary to know a little of the history of the Gulf, and this you will find in the next chapter. II. EARLY HISTORY The first Europeans to be seen in force in the Persian Gulf were Greeks. Three hundred years before Christ that remarkable man Alexander the Great marched an arny of Macedonians and Greeks to the conquest of India, but, finding the country larger and hotter than they liked, they decided to come home by way* of the Gulf, t Alexander, with part of the /armyKB - 2 - XIIDIV army, marched from near Karachi through southern Persia to the Basra area; while another detachment, under his admired Nearchus, sailed with the heavy equipment in 1,800 small and unsafe ships along the north shore of the Gulf. The journey took them from early November 326 B.C. ^ to late February 325 ^ rom what has been recorded of their' : experiences it may be inferred that none of them was keen to repeat it. Nevertheless, Alexander sent expeditions to explore the south shore of the Gulf and, when he died in 323 before ever he reached home, had ordered Nearchus to try to sail round .Arabia to Suez. The next on the scene were the Portuguese and it was apparently pepper that brought them. Our European ancestors of the Middle Ages seem to have had a rare fondness for pepper and other spices from the East, and for these they were prepared to pay well. Persia, India and China, also produced finely manufactured goods, silks and brocades, the demand for which was possibly created by our ancestors* wives: the demand was certainly furious. These things had to find their way to tho Mediterranean either overland, through the Persian Gulf, or through the Red Sea, and the cost of transporting them was so high that it was soon realised that a fortune awaited anyone who could operate an all^eea route to India. The Portuguese were the first to achieve it, and Vasco da Gama’s voyage round the Cape of Good Hope to India in 1498 was one of the most significant events in all the histoiy of the East. The Portuguese then planned to send their ships to India to fetch the merchandise and to stop the trade up the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea which was, at the time, being profitably carried on by Arab merchants. Tne first thing the inoffensive Arab merchants knew was the arrival of the Portuguese Admiral AffonscT cU Albuquerque, af the head of a squadron of^six warships, at Ras &lt;11 Hadd, the easte^nost comer of Arabia, 'it is difficult to improve on the oldest account of his proceedings there -• ; 'And they found there... 30 or 40 fishing ship^T ^Kich were come thither from the city of Ormuz, Calayate, and all that coast to fish. .Kj^nd they burned all these ships, and on the following morning set sail with a fair wind, and took the ships* boats with masts and sails*At Quraiyat, farther up the coast, 'he was ill received and, storming the town, met with a vigorous opposition, but entered with tho death of 80 of the enemy and loss of three Portuguese; after the plunder the place was burnt, and with it 14 vessels that were in the harbour. Hence he sailed eight leagues iurther to Mascate. So it went on » and we should remember that^ this was the Arab’s first introduction to Christian Europeans. Finally aJ Albuquerque captured Hormuz, which must then have been very different from the unimpressive ruins which may still be seen on the island of that name near Bandar ^ibbas. .according to writers of the timew it was as bigge as Exeter, the buildings faire and spacious...” and doing more trace in its best days than London and Amsterdam combined 11 ; and Milton wrote of 'The wealth of Ormuz and of Ind. 1 ' During nearly a hundred years while they had things much their own way, except for some Turkish opposition from the direction of Iraq, the Portuguese built forts along tne Batina coast, at Muscat, Hormuz, and Bahrein, dominating completely the trade and politics of the Persian Gulf, while the Pbpa confirmed their ICing in his title of 'Lord of the Conquest, Navigation and Commerce of India, Ethiopia, Arabia, and Persia*' Possibly it was too much accent on the 'Conquest” and not enough on the 'Commerce' which made uhe prosperity of Hormuz decline under their management and, more serious, brought upon them the disapproval of one of the greatest men who ever ruled^Persia — Shah Abbas. In 1602 he drove them from Bahrein and in 1620 x rom a position they occupied near Ras &lt;2U Khaima on the Trucial Coast; while in the years between he established a new port, which he named Bandar abbas after himself, as a rival to Hormuz, During the same years various enterprising Englishmen took advantage of the security prevailing throughcub Persia under Shall Abbas to visit his Court, and the King of Spain (who had subjugated Portugal in 158o) sent a succession of priests to represent him* Shah Abbas, however, did not hold with priests and wrote to the King that 'He was weary of receiving Friers as Ambassadors' and asking to be sent ’’some Spanish Gentleman of Note' instead, 'for he should know /betterEB -3- XIIDIV better how to treat with such a one, and God and His Majesty would be better served, because a religious man out of his cell was like a fish out of water#' The Shall got his Spanish Gontlemon of Note, who peremptorily demanded the restitution of certain places lately conquered by the Persians, and the exclusion of the English and all other Europeans from the Persian trade. 'This was too much for the Shah, who tore up the letters and swore that, so far from restoring what he had already taken, he would drive the Portuguese from their fortress at Hormuz; while he ordered a Farman to be made out granting the sole trade in silks by the sea route to the English'. ^ The Shah kept his word, but, since then, hundreds of Europeans have repeated the Spaniard^ mistake. Hover try, like the Spanish Gentleman of Note, to be high-handed v/ith the Persians. Rather typically, it was a large consignment of unsaleable broadcloth that first brought the British to Persia, but to make the matter clear it is necessary to go back a little. The defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1388 made the English realise that there was no reason to continue letting the Spanish and Portuguese monopolise such a good thing as the Eastern trad®, and in the year 1600 Queen Elizabeth was pleased to grant a charter to 'The Governor and Company of the Merchants of London trading into the East Indies', who proceeded to establish a trading-post or 'factory' at Surat on the west coast of India, Their object was 'by fair means to obtain a quiet and peaceable trade,' but the Portuguese saw fit to interfere and had to be defeated in two sea-battles off Surat in 1612 and I6l5% And so we get back to our broadcloth, which was then England 1 s chief article of export. The Company were at their wits’ end to know how to dispose of a large consignment of it which had arrived at Surat, and which the Indians (and you can hardly blame them, considering the climate) showed no eagerness to buy. The Compasy thought they saw light when they heard from a traveller that in Persia they might be assured 'of the vente of much cloth, in regard their country is much cold, and men, women, and children are clothed therewith some five months of the year', and they established their first 'factory' in Persia at Jask, with others at Shiraz and Isfahan. The Portuguese Fleet, of course, interfered again and was defeated in a hot battle off Jask in 1620. ♦ In 1622 the British did an odd thing. The Persians, who were besieging Hormuz with a land army (Shah .abbas was keeping his word to the Spanish Ambassador) much needed help from the sea, demanded with threats and promises the assistance of a British Fleet which happened to be nearby. Although England and Spain were at peace the Company agreed, and the Fleet joined forces with the Persians to drive out the unfortunate Portuguese. The Persians took the lion’s share of the loot and practically demolished Hormuz, which never again raised its head; but Portuguese power in the G-ulf was broken and the English opened a 'factory' at Bandar Abbas, which remained the centre of their activities in the Gulf for 150 years. There was one relieving feature of the incident, of a nature unusual at that time. In the words of a Portuguese historian, 'The English Captains have performed their promise made upon yield-up of the Castle, by giving two of their own ships or pinasses to carry away all the people whither they would goe, also by defending them that at no time neither Moor nor Inf idell should do them any hurt.. • and more, they have given hospitality to our sick and wounded, which are neere about two hundred at the least, whom they have sustained and cured with as great care and diligence as if they had boene their own brothers. ” The British, however, were far from being out of the wood: during the succeeding years they had to compete with the far more formidable rivalry of the Dutch East India Company which had also established itself at Bandar Abbas. The Dutch proved astute traders, and, as their Company was run as a State enterprise with the whole-hearted backing of the Government, they soon drew ahead of the English Company, which was a private undertalcing with lukewarm Government support. The conduct of the Persians was exasperating to both Dutch and English, and the Dutch in 1650 used force to coerce them. This, though it temporarily increased /theirSB “*4- XIIDIV their ascendancy, redounded to their disadvantage in the long run, for the Persians did not forget it. The position of the English Company was strengthened about 1700 by the amalgamation with it of various competing companies and by more determined Government support, and with the turn ^fL+he century came the turning-point in their fortunes. This was signalised^* in a^ typically Oriental manner - the Shah of Persia decided to honour the British 'factory” at Isfahan with a State visit. 'Mr. Bruce, the Company's agent, and all the factory, great and small, were ordered to leave their house and chamber doors and warehouses nil , open, for His Majesty and his Seraglio companions to ramble thro', and take such things as best pleased him and his minions; and there was a table left in the * Dining Hoorn spread with the richest sweetmeats and fruit. I believe the Company was not very ambitious of having such honours conferred on them, since they were obliged to pay for them.” Twelve thousand pounds the bill came to, out, in spite of this, the Dutch tried their best to secure a similar honour from the Shah, and failed. The Shah's goodwill proved well worth the money and British fortunes forged ahead, but unfortunately it was not long before Persia entered on a period of anarchy, so that the trade declined, and for nearly a hundred lean years it seemed hardly worth while hanging on. The French, too, established themselves at Bandar Abbas, and although they never proved dangerous rivals in trade they caused serious inconvenience during the periodic wars of the eighteenth century. The Bandar ^^bbas factory was closed down in 1763 and another opened at Bushire, while, for a few years in the interval, Basra was the centre of British commercial activity. About this time the competition of the Dutch finally faded out as they tended to con centrate their attention more on their Far Eastern possessions, and since then the British have remained the paramount power in the Persian Gulf. The story of what they have done and have not done, during these hundred and eighty years must form another chapter. III. 'THE MOST UNSELFISH IAGE IN HISTOKT... In 1763, when Britain found herself alone in the field of commercial enterprise, the Gulf was in a state of chaos, uncharted and uribuoyed, and infested by pirates and the roving war-fleets of -^rab potentates. For many years relations between Persia and the .^rabs had been governed by 'The ancient law, the simple plan, That he shall take who hath the power, And he shall keep who can', and, roughly between the years 1600 and 1700, the Persians had done the taking, ^t various times they had occupied nearly all the Arab coast from Basra to Muscat, but as disorders in Persia increased, their hold on these places slipped, and from about 1700 the -irabs controlled the entire south shore and dominated parts of the Persian coast, notably the Lingeh corner. It was therefore the ; x rabs who provided the British authorities with most of their problems, and the first problem was piracy, The^men of the Persian Gulf in general and of the Pirate Coast (now Truoial Coast) in particular had long been notorious for piracy so that no ship of any nationality, unless heavily armed or convoyed, was safe any where between India and Africa. The story of the pirates will be told in tae section on the Trucial Coast, but here it is just necessary to mention that the East India Company sent an expedition against them in 1809j ajad a little later a Turko-Egyptian a my under Mohammed Ali Pasha, an Albanian soldier who had risen to become Viceroy of Egypt under the Turks and from whom the present King of Egypt is descended, advanced against the Wahhabi from the west. The Wahhabi were the followers of a puritan reformer named Mohammed ibn Abdal Wahhab, who set out to clean up Islam. They were Bedouins of central Arabia, tough, savage, fanatical, and recklessly brave, and their hand was turned as much against other Muslims who disagreed with their ideas as against Christians. They captured the port of Qatif in 1000 and their hold soon spread to the whole Arab shore of the Gulf, whose inhabitants found it convenient to / conformEB -5- XI.IDIV confftm to their tenets* Although the Vv r ahhabi were corxirindecl by their great leader the .aidr Sa• ud, ancestor of the present King of Saudi Arabia, the Egyptians overman their countly and reached the Persian Gulf at Hasa in 1818* By this time the British, who had been too lenient with the pirates after their first expedition, found themselves compelled to sena another, and they deputed one of their officers, an Irish captain called Sadleir, to secure the co-operation of the Egyptians, V/hen Sadleir reached Hasa he discovered that the Egyptians, who found ^rabia too large, turbulent and barren to hold, had already begun to withdraw westwards, but his orders were to contact them, so he followed. The farther he went the farther they retreated until, after untold difficidtrs and dangers, he came out on the snores of the Red Sea, his horse dying under him just as he arrived* His crossing of Arabia, alone and at that date, is a feat of courage and endurance which deservos to be remembered* The expedition (undertaken, of course, without ary help from the Egyptians) was successful, and a general Treaty of Peace was signed in 1820 by which the iirabs bound themselves to abandon piracy 'against ary nation whatsoever* M Britain thus won security for the ships of all nations trading to the Persian Gulf* In the succeeding years British officials applied themselves to eliminating the perpetual sea-warfare x-^vailing between the Arab tribes, and a Treaty of Peace in Perpetuity was signed in 1853* This provided for the cessation of all war/dike acts at sea, victims of aggrossion being required not to retaliate but to report the matter to the British authorities, and was an immense boon to all concerned* With what the .urabs did to each other on land Britain did not concern herself, but the peace at sea has continued unbroken to this day, Britain's next problem was the slave trade. She had herself taken a leading part in it at one time and, as was fitting, she took the lead in suppressing it, starting as early as 1772. The law of the Qur'an permits the enslavement of non-Muslim prisoners of war who refuse to become Muslims, and the law of the Qur*an is the law of the ^rab States of the Persian Gulf to this day* This condition, however, was frequently disregarded and for centuries persons other than prisoners of war were enslaved, especially persons of African origin* The Qur'an also enjoins that slaves should be well fed and clothed, given wives, and kindly treated, and that the freeing of slaves is an act pleasing in the sight of God* About a hundred years ago the JL\ rabs were accordingly importing annually in sailing-vessels from Africa perhaps as many as 10,000 African^ whose descendants may be seen to-day swarming in any port of the Gulf* In 1320 there was an anti-slavery clause inserted in the General Treaty of Peace, but it remained a dead letter in the absence of means to enforce it* Since then Britain has gradually tightened up her preventive measures by her treaties with Persia, Turkey (who controlled Iraq until 1914), as well as with the .urabs, until to-^Lay the slave trade in the Persian Gulf is virtually dead* I said the slave trade, not slavery: many oi the persons of African blood (pure or diluted) you see are still slaves, but they may not be bought or sold and oan have their freedom at any time they as a for it at a British Political agency or on board any British warship* Only those who are born of slave parents and who choose of their own iroe will to stay on in their master's house need remain slaves, but this is a large number* ^irab masters would often gladly bo rid of the idle slaves whom tradition compels them to sux&gt;port; and domestic slavery has almost entirely ceased in Kuwait, Bahrein, and Muscat, Elsewhere it frequently happens that a slave, who after a tiff with his master, has come to the Political jigent and demanded his freedom, spends a few weeks earning his living as a free man in a world of free competition, and then returns to his master, begging to be taken back into the comfort and security of slavery. ^ 1 u ^ ^P ^t ^rfnr ~ ~ p -'r th— a I ^af^ oc .Yiafrh'-thi /j odd mo»o oy legs thi? ■“Wit hIj* i nr ip n pp bnunti , rx .iniLVfr vl-■.y.u'!

During the nineteenth century a cable and (later) a wireless system through the Gulf was established linking India with Europe and providing inter^co muni cat ion between the Persian and i.rab coastal ports. At the same time the Gulf was accurately surveyed by personnel of the Royal and Royal Indian Navies and a series of charts prepared which have since proved an inestimable boon to the shipping of all nations* The same may be said of the establishment of lighthouses and the placing of buoys wherever required, and of the preparation and publication of tide tables. Public health was also a primary concern of the British y^uthorities, and statistical and meteorological information was collected. Quarantine arrangements were made at all the larger ports so that the incidence of plague was much diminished and the scourge of cholera banished the Persian Gulf. The island of Kharg (north-west cf Bushire) was occupied from 1838 to 1842 and again in 1856-^7 i n course of hostilities which broke out between Great Britain and Persia, during which the British also took Bushire and Khorramshahr (then called Muhammerah) und sent an army as far as Ahwaz. At this time the Turks, who controlled Iraq, also claimed a shadowy suzerainty over Kuwait, Hasa and Qatar* Lord Curzon summed up Britain’s position at that time in a speech to the Trucial Chiefs in 1903: 'Sometimes I think that the record of the past is in danger of being forgotten ••• We saved you from extinction at the hands of your neighbours* We opened these seas to the ships of all nations and enabled their flags to fly in peace* We have not seized or held your territory* We have not destroyed your independence, but have preserved it. We are not now going to throw away this century of costly and triumphant enterprise; we shall not wipe out the most unselfish page in history ***The peace cf these waters must still be maintained; your independence will continue to be upheld; and the influence of the British Government must remain supreme. 1 ’ Although this may read a trifle bombastically now, and we should be inclined to a modification, or at least to a less forthright expression, of these opinions, the position then was different. \/hat amounted to an international rush for the Persian Gulf was in progress* 'The French, whose status in Muscat was nominally identical with that of Great Britain, desired to secure a coaling station there in 1895; Russia, in the endeavour to enlarge her sphere of influence, sent various missions thither* ostensibly to establish a ‘worm-water port’ to serve as a constant outlet for her trade, and heavily subsidised a line of steamers from the Black Sea; Turkey assumed control of the S totes on the western litteral, claiming suzerainty over Hasa and Bahrein and even Oman, and endeavouring to bring within her orbit the long-autonomous principality of Kuwait; while Germany, in pursuance of her Oriental policy and the realisation of her dream of a through route from Hamburg to the Persian Gulf, spared no pains to obtain a solid footing under the guise of commercial expansion..*/ ^There was, at the time, a flourishing trade in madern rifles from Muscat across the Gulf to South Persia, whence they reached warlike Afghan tribes, who used them to disturb the peaoe of British India, and most of Persia and Arabia was armed from the same source. Many of these arms arrived in French ships, and the protection of the French flag was used, too, by many of the dhows engaged in the slave trade. All-these -©f nP-riotioif WGfce eradicated by t^e establishtianik of., the Entente Cordiale with France-, and rivalry with Russia abated after the •- signing- of -the- Angla^RasSfian COTftSTltigh 'oT'1907 which .spoiltntod the — Persian Gulf British sphere of influent, In 1914 a British army passed through the Persian Gulf to Iraq, where it fought a prolonged and arduous campaign resulting in the /liberationr 3 Si EB -7- XIIDIV liberation of that country from Turkish domination and its establishment as an independent ^irab State* Mest of East Persia was occupied too as preliminary to the formation of a cordon to prevent G-erman agents infiltrating from Turkey into Afghanistan with the object of instigating that country to attack India* This gave the Germans an opportunity of playing on Persian patriotism, and their agent Wossmuss succeeded in raising the 'jashgai tribe in the hinterland of Bushire and in diverting the best part of a division of British troops, an exploit which others of their agents have endeavoured to emulate in this war* It is now time to turn to the Persian Gulf as it is to-day, and, to keep the distinction clear, we will deal with Persia and the .^rab States separately, but before doing so it would perhaps be as well to explain the system of political control which has been evolved# The chief representative of British interests is the Political Lt Resident in the Persian Gulf* There are also iConsuls at Kbori^amshahr, rUlf * wit Bushire, and Bandar Abbas, with a British Consular Agent at Lingeh* On the Arab side he controls Political Agents at Kuwait, Bahrein, and Muscat, and, subordinate to the Political .tigent at Bahrein, a Political Officer on the Trucial Coast* These Political .agents c,re nothing to do with elections* They are the representatives of the British and Indian Governments in the territories to which they are posted, and discharge the functions of Consuls besides doing many things which an ordinary Consul does not have to do* As it is obviously not desirable that Europeans and Americans should have to submit to Arab Courts and Qur*anic law, all foreigners are (by treaty with the various rulers) subject to the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the Political Agent. Joint Courts consisting of the Political Agent and the Sheikh, or, for minor cases, of the Assistant Political Agent aud one of the Sheikh* s relations, are held to try cases in which foreigners and the Sheikh’s subjects are both involved* [Jis the representativ^tif Britain, and as the authority protecting nationals of all foreign countries, the Political Agent nairurally can and does influence and guide the Sheikh in many matters lying beyond the scope^of treaties* J Members of the .allied Forces should^ only have dealings with the local authorities through the Political Agent/' who is best a ole to ensure that the maximum of co-operation is secured from the Arabs while their rights and susceptibilities are respected by the Allies; ^ (or, with the^rills off, to see that/fche Arabs play ball and we don*t tread on tj^lr toes more than we hap/e to). Apart from oil, the foreign trade of the Gulf is mostly with Bombay, and the great majority of British subjects living in the Gulf are Indians* For these reasons, as well as for historical ones, the Political Officers are members of the Indian Political Service, appointed from India, and the policy they follow is the joint product of the Government of India and Whitehall* The fact that some have military rank while others do not merely shows that they entered the Service from the Arny and not from the Indian Civil Service ~ plain Mr. may actually hold a more responsible post than Major, here as elsewhere* IV. THE FGRSIaN SHORE* The Persians are an Aryan race and speak an Aryan language. This means, that their language is similar to European languages and not to Arabic and Turkish, and that the/^possibly come of the same race as European nations* Although overfrun at various times by Mongols, Tartars, Turks, Arabs and Afghans^ the Persians have never been submerged: they have kept their language, traditions, and culture alive and have always absorbed their conquerors* . Their language is a good one and has progressed linguistically much further than many European languages, but in the Middle Ages Persia adopted the Arabic writing, and with it many Arabic words. This has made Persian much more difficult for us to learn and understand, but it is still worth learning* It has a store of poetry of a high order, and some of the ancient Persian poets have been translated into mary of the languages of Europe* The Persians are proud of their origin and justly proud of /theirEB -8- XI3DIV their language and literature* Four hundred years 'before Christ the warrior-king Darius, Derd of Medes and Persians'* of Bibical fajae, led Persian arraies through o of what later became South Russia and sent arraies to attack Greece* ajnd he that stands will die for nought and home there* s no returning', and so forth* Darius also led his armies to Palestine, Syria and Egypt* During much of her history Persia ruled Iraq, the Caucasus and parts of central ^iSia. The Persian King Nadir Shah conquered Afghanistan and North India, and reached Delhi, where he held a massacre of the civil population.which is reriejjbered^ to this d ay - almost exactly three ^ “'hundred years afbe ryUT*The Persians are proud 'of“ therrgpaib nil it ary J ^ fliere ~areK&amp;dw** innjnierabl© amali things or which Persians IJre proud, such as their calendar, which is, in point of fact, more scientific and convenient than our own* I have now told you four times that Persian are proud, and it is the first point to remember when dealing with them* They are also very polite, and, although such punctiliousness may appear to us somewhat exaggerated, it is best when meeting or speaking with them to use your most ceremonious manner* They are a witty, cheerful, friendly people much addicted to gardens, flowers and picnics, and are quick to respond to appreciation of these things in others* Modem Persians hate to be thought Oriental* For the last twenty years they have been striving mightily to westernise and industrialise their country - an uphill task in which irhey have made great strides. They like foreigners to notice how much more western Persia is than most of her neighbours. “What I have said hitherto applies chiefly to educated Persians and the official class, but the Persian peasant, although he may not be so enthusiastic about westernisation, has roughly the same ideas in a modified form. He is a likeable fellow, hardy and industrious, and very much imposed upon. On the whole one does not see the best type of either on the Persian Gulf littoral: the villagers are, if anything, poorer and more down-trodden than elsewhere, and Persian officials regard service in the Gulf as a penance and do their utmost to avoid it. Persia is the second largest country abutting on the Gulf - three times as big as France in area, and with a population variously estimated at from 1C millions to 15 millions* Until August 1941 she had a Navy consisting of two sloops or gunboats and four motor patrol vessels. Her garrisons stationed in the main towns were the largest and best equipped on the Gulf, and she now has an air force* She had a strong and autocratic Shah who, riding on the wave of nationalism which wae to some extent the result of the indignities Persia had suffered in the last war, set about seeing that Persia was mistress in her own house* He subdued rebellious tribes throughout the country and reasserted Persian claims to the islands and opposite shore of the Persian Gulf* The British, bowing before the storm, abandoned their telegraph concessions and coaling stations on the islands of Henjam and Qishm* Difficulties also arose when it was proposed to establish an air-route to India along the Persian shore of the Gulf, and it became clear that the Persians did not desire the route to be administered by foreigners, while they were still not able to shoulder the responsibility and expense of administering it themselves. Further, they demanded that the route should pass through the interior. This was not considered practicable and the air-line was therefore organised to pass along the Arab shore, to which neither Britain nor the Arabs have ever admitted Persian claims. But, for the Persian Gulf, the most momentous innovation was the construction of the trans-Persian railway from Bandar Shahpur, on the Gulf, to Bandar Shah on the Caspian Sea. During the whole of the nineteenth century the main route into the interior had been from Bushire V 'The King with half the East at heel is marched from lands of morning, His fighters drink the river up, their shafts benight the air,EB -9- XIIDIV to Shiraz, and, in consequence, the port of Bttshire had flourished at the expense of Bandar Abbas* During tho last 10 years or so it has been the turn of Bushire to decline in favour of Bandar Shahpur, and, more recently 'KhorraSnshahr: which have better harbours, and the trade of Persia has beeI^ , ; concentrated at the head of the Gulf. In addition, burdensome customs regulations and the abuses of petty official done, far from the control of Tehran have made the lot of traders in the Gulf ports of Persia difficult, and the ports themselves present a dismal picture of depression and decay* Many of the merchants and thousands of shopkeepers, artisans and labourers have emigrated to the urab side, where freedom from irksome restrictions and Government control makes life easier, and they have taken much oi the trade with them# For instance, the market in pearls (the most important export, after oil, from the Gulf) has been entirely transferred from Lingeh to Dibai and other -*rab ports, which have benefited immensely* Abadan presents a vivid contrast* This island, near the head of the Gulf, houses the largest oil refinery in the world* It; receives its crude oil supplies by pipe-line from the producing fields of the interior and, in 1938, exported and sold over 9^ million tons of oil, on which the Persian Government received over £3,300,000 in royalty payments* The concession in which the oil fields are situated was granted to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Go* in 1901, ii^s lease was re/negotiated in 1933, expires in 1993* The industry is now Persia*s greatest after agriculture, and employs about 1,600 British and over 50,000 Persian personnel* Every effort is being made to associate x-’ersians more and more in the work and management of the Company, and they already fill many responsible positions* V* THE ARuB SHORE. The ^rabs are culturally and linguistically distinct from the Persians* It is not surprising that the culture they have developed in their empty, burning deserts is quite distinct from that produced £\mid^%v green fields and teeming towns; but the civilisations of which we and the Persians are so proud owe much more to Arab thought and ideas than many of us realise* The Semitic language group has given the world its great monotheistic religions -^Judaism, Christianity, and Islam*^ The idea that there could be only one God was theirs* Jesus Christ was a Semite and spoke a language akin to xorabic* They gave us other things, too* In the Dark they learnt and improved upon the scientific knowledge of the Greeks and, to some extent^of the ancient Hindus, passing it on to Europe through their academies of learning in Baghdad and Egypt, as well as Musiimr Spain and Sicily* This knowledge was the seed from which our modern science has grown* arab ideas and Arab dress are well suited to their climate, and they have the sense to reali^e^that, as they cannot change their climate, they would gain nothing by opting the habits of Europe* The ^rab has no inferiority complex vis^—vis the European* He realises, of course, that the Westerner luxe many material possessions that he has to do without, but he reflects that the Christian will roast in Hell for all eternity while the Muslim will be luxuriating in Heaven* Considering that he has the best of the bargain he feels pity for us rather than envy* ^ The ^erabs never forget that all men are equal in the sight of God and this makes them as democratio as any people on earth* There is no word for n mister' in desert Arabic - it simply is not needed* A Bedouin with a rag round his stomach and an income of a few gallons of camel’s milk per annum will address a Sheikh worth hundreds of thousands of pounds ^ is the religion founded by Mohammed^^eaSHriie followers of rtfAigjpw. are oalled Muslims* j + Khorramshar now handles a far larger tonnage than Bandar Shahpur or any other Gulf port.EB -10' XIIDIV a yotir^ or even a King^ by his first mriiej v/ithout o.ny title* airo-b ruler is intensely sensitive to public opinion, and in any ca,se will take no Important step without consulting an informal council composed of the leading members of his family, which often includes women. Succession in the leadership of a tribe does not necessarily go from father to eldest son; a generation may be skipped or a younger son chosen in place of an elder if the greybeards of tne tribe think it advisable. Indeed,^- it was possibly this custom which caused the great split in Islam between Sunnis (in ^rabia and Turkey) and Shiahs (in Persia). When the prophet Mohammed died the Arabs thought it perfectly natural to choose three of his elderly companions to succeed him in turn before choosing his son-in-law and nearest relative, 'nli. The Persians, with their rigid ideas of kingship and succession, thought that h*li was the only rightful successor. Shiahs and Sunnis have been at loggerheads ever since and the question still hasn’t been decided. i. Iraq. Iraq, like Persia, has seen better days. It was a country of 25,000,000 people when the Mongols captured Baghdad in 1097 and destroyed the system of canals by which the country lived. It has never regained its former prosperity and now has only about 4,000,000 inhabitants. Its seaboard is small, but about 75 miles up the Shatt al iii’ab river lies Basra, which at one time was by far the largest port in the Persian Gulf. + Two hundred and sixty steamers docked there in 1938, and the Basra Port authority now maintains all the buoys and lighthouses in the Gulf* Large oil reserves have been proved by the Iraq Petroleum Co. at their Kirkuk field, discovered in 1928, but the Company’s crude oil production is at present limited to four million tons per annum, which is the existing capacity of the twin pipe-lines to Haifa and Tripoli. ^Iter oil, Iraq’s largest export is of dates and these are exported from Basra. In fact, Iraq and the area of south-west Persia near the lie ad of the Gulf produce together no less than 80 per cent of the world 1 s supply of data^4 in 19U : Bf3, 000 tons were shipped from Gulf portal The trade in dates, ‘‘whi ch mostly carried in sailing boats from Kuwait, is therefore one of 'great importance locally. Great Britain and the maintain consular representatives in Basra. ii. Kuwait. In Arabic Al Kuwait means ’’the little fort, ,, and its people have always tried to maintain the State as a little fortress between its powerful neighbours, Iraq and Saudi Arabia.' Shortly after the foundation of the town about 1750 it served as a refuge for a large part of the population of Basra when the latter was conquered by the Persians in 1776, and, at the same time, much of the trade of central Arabia was diverted to Kuwait. When the ^rabs won back Basra in 1779 unary of the refugees stayed on in Kuwait, attracted no doubt by the superior climate and excellent harbour, and thus the foundation of the town’s prosperity was laid. To protect his country against Bedouin raids and minor foreign encroachments, the ruler, Sheikh Sir Ahmed Al Jabir -AL Sabah, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., has six Lewis gins mounted on trucks, 150 trained soldiers armed with *303 rifles, and 80 armed police. But every ^rab considers himself a soldier, and the town walls could probably be manned by 6,000 armed men and boys in an emergency, while larger numbers of Bedouin^tfcribesmen would come forward for the defence of the State, But against major aggression the Kuwaitis rely on the protection of the British Government and on the fact that their neighbours have promised the British to respect the Integrity and independence of Kuwait. The Sheikh comes of a branch of the Utub section of the ^uiaizab tribe of central ^rabia, to which section the Sheikhs of Bahrein also belong, It is his own responsibility to rule ■r i r f T rr- ~ ^ » mmtmmm m —^ m i ,m m« ■* ~ ^ wm ■ •m m m* .m. + Though it may well be again the largest port, at the moment Khorrdmshahr has a far larger capacity.- 11 - XI ID IV I!

Kuwait exports in return little of value except pearls, and lives on the profits of her shipbuilding industry, trade, and the earnings of her deep-sea sailors* ^*rab sailing ship 3 known as^booms' (\dth pointed stems) and !l sambuqs'(with square built the re, and some 60 of these fit for long journeys and up to 300 tons burden are normally maintained, as well as several hundred sj.ialler pearling boats. The big ships sail very fast, especially before the wind, and have been known to cover the 1,200 miles between Kuwait and Karachi m five days. The voyages of the Kuwait ships are interesting.

The difficulties and dangers of these voyages have made the Kuwaitis enterprising and self-reliant sailors as well as astute traders, and for those qualities they compare favourably with any people in the Gulf. ■ ’ k * -l -vouraoi. v . expected that, in future, the chief, export of Kuwait vvill be oil.

The ^rabs tell a story of his justice: Ono of thorn cm.n to his court reported that he had seen two bags of grain lying in the desert. 'Hot; did you know that the bags contained grain? 1 ' asked the King* 'I touched them with ny finger,” said the a.rob* 'With which finger?' asked the King* 'With this one,' the ..rah answered, holding it up. The King turned to his slaves: 'Cut it offj' he ordered. 'How often have I told you ^rabs not to touch other peopled propertyl'' The province of Hasa is governed for Ibn Saud by an ^jnir residing at Hofuf, an oasis inland of Bahrein Island, and most of the population (about 150,000) is centred between hero and the ports of Oatif and Oqair* „ It is here too that oil has been found and development is being undertaken by the Ca lifor nian ^rabian Standard Oil Company, an entirely ^mierican ■‘ v '' concern operating under a concession granted by Ibn Saud to the Standard Oil Company in 1933* Oil in considerable quantities was struck in 1938 in the Dhahrnn area, and development was just getting under way at the outbreak of war. Moout a hundred wnericans live in a well&lt;&lt;ippointed air- conditioned village at Dhahran and a xx&gt;rt is being developed at Has Tonura* /jnerican interests, in fact, hold oil concessions for nearly all Saudi Arabia - an area believed to contain oil reserves of considerable magnitude, though Ibn Saud owns no big port on the Persian Gulf his influence there is nevertheless great. Had he not promised to maintain friendly relations with Persian G-ulf States having treaties with the British Government* he would doubtless have a.bsorbed most of them before now, and their rulers, who fully realise this, have a deep respect and admiration for Ibn Saud and treat his wishes with deference. There is no Political Kgent or other British representative in Hasa, relations with Ton Saud being conducted through the British Minister In Jedda, on the Red Sea. *. * -fc ***rfcy^ Bahrein is .an island thirty miles long by ten miles broad '~ith jmT waigak giwwlwi m the world* It usea to have a ring of decrepit fishing villages round the edge and just desert in the centre. Nowadays there is an oilfield, refinery, and an air-conditioned 'camp' in the centre; the villages of Manama and Muharraq (on a separate island) have become fair—sized towns with many modem amenities; and palaces have sprung up everywhere, | ^1 h ir inh, bhe ''j.Tapf-j; The island of Bahrein, v/ith its satellite islands, is ruled by the iil Khalifa family of the Utub tribe which invaded it from the mainland of Arabia in 1783 and conquered it. To this day they number only a few hundred families and belong to the Sunni sect, whereas. their predecessors, the Baharina, belong to the opposition Shiah sect and number some 50,000 - half the population of the islands. There are 15,000 Persians of both sects, and 1,000 Indians of several religions, so that sectarian strife is apt to cause trouble. The islanders also have to adapt themselves to the presence of some 500 British and up to 100 Anericans of the oil companies* The Sheikh, who is an independent Arab ruler enjoying British protection, is Sir Sulman ibn Hamad A1 Khalifa, and to help him in his Government he employs a British adviser, Mr* G.D. Belgrave. He also has British experts to run the Customs, Engineering, Public Health, and Education Departments, and a force of 350 armed police, who are probably the best trained and /organi sed It should be emphasised that our privileged position in the Gulf Sheikhdoms derives from treaties with the various tribes and was not acquired by force*EB -13- XIIDIV organised in the Persian Gulf, Bahrein lias gone in for education in a big way. There are schools for boys, and as parents find that education increases the marriage-value of their daughters, the girls* school, which owes its inception to the keenness and initiative of Mrs, Belgrave, is also flourishing, and there are many more applicants than there are vacancies.

Under a clause in their contract the company must employ locals for Whatever skilled work they are capable of, and they have accordingly founded a technical school where the youth of the island may acquire the necessary skilljU After oil, pearling is the most important industry, and Bahrein is one of the centres of the world’s pearl trade. Unlikely as it may seem, the sea is warm enough for deep diving only from June to September, and at the end of May about 400 boats with 15,000 divers leave for the banks. No modern apparatus is used; the diver just fastens a clip to his nose, takes a mesh bag in one hand and a stone in the other, and goes down - soi.setir.ies as deep, as ten fathcis. He gathers in the bag as many oysters a.s he can find in a minute or so, and then comes u$ for a couple of minutes’ rest, hanging on to a pole at the side of the boat, .^fter about ten dives he comes out of the water for a longer rest. It is very exhausting work, particularly as only light meals can be eaten, and those not more than twice a day. In the evening the divers sit round' and open the oysters. Each boat pools its catch and every man from the captain to the cabin-boy gets his share according to old-established custom. Some of the best pearls in the world are found in the Gulf and the annual value of Bahrein’s catch is sometimes over a. million pounds st or ling. Most of the pearls are bought by Indian merchants and reTsold in Bombay, whence, in peace time, the pearls for the European i.iarket found their way to Paris, The pearl trade is so vita.1 for the prosperity of the Arabs that any iirae who prejudiced it by introducing artificial or cultured pearls into the Gulf would be lucky if he escaped with his life, v/hile the British authorities have always sternly discouraged attempts by European interlopers to exploit the pear ling-banks by using modem methods. Although fresh water fre i the highlands of central Arabia, passing under hundreds of miles of desert and under the sea, wells up in Bahrein and in the sea around it, the island grows little besides dates and lucerne, and not nearly enough of these for its require ents. Except for fish, all food and other necessities of life have to come from abroad and are paid for with the profits from oil and pearls. The island also enjoys a lucrative entreat trade, as most of the imports and exports of Hasa pass through it. Going eastwards down the Gulf the jurisdiction of the Political .^gent, Bahrein, extends to the peninsula of Qatar and to Trucial 0 :im } usually known as the Trucial Coast. Qat4T is the ’’sterile promontory” 100 miles long by 50 miles broad lying immediately south-east of Bahrein, Sheikh ixbdullah bin Jasiu A1 Thani, C.I.E., of the Utub tribe, whose capital is at Doha on the east coast, rules about 30,000 settled inhabitants and exercises a shadowy suzerainty over the Bedouin who co' c and go between the interior of his State end Saudi Arabia, The people are primitive in the extreme, end their views on world affairs may bo summed \i~ x by saying that they don’t like foreigners, and particularly the Turks, who occupied their country up to 1925, They live largely by fishing end peerl-diving, sending- Ik ~ XIIDIV out a pear ling-fleet of soue 800 boats each year carrying 13,000 divers, hut their future lies in oil. In 1933 the Sheikh granted the ^nglo-Iranian Oil Co-pamy a l^-yoox concession, which was subsequently transferred to Petroleum Development (Qataf) Ltd., a company associated with the Iraq petroletui Company G-roup. Development work began in 1937 and has resulted in the discovery of oil in what promises to be large co . .--iOrcial quant it io^s. V. The Trucial Coast The Trucial Coast begins at the south-east corner of Qatar and runs for 400 miles to the village of Sha’a . near the tip of the Has Masandam peninsula. The mountainous head of the peninsula belongs to the Sultanate of muscat; then the Trucial Coast,begins again at Dibba and runs some 30 miles south to the border of muscat territory at liurair. ^ Reading from^ west to east a.long the coa.st lie the Trucial Shoikhdoi-is of nbu Dhabi, DiD^vi, Sharja, 4j: an, Uv.m al Q^aiwain, Ras al Khaima and Kalba. Besides thesc^ there are other Sheikhablis, such as Pujaira and Hc-.riyah, which, although they liave established themselves as independent of the larger Sheikhdoms, are signatories to no truce and have no treaties with the British Government. Inland, practically no boundaries are agreed on, and the roving Bedouins pay allegiance to one Sheikh or to another - or to none at all - as the spirit moves them. To understand the rather complex position it is necessary to go back and look briefly at the exceedingly interesting history of the Coast. In the past the people of the Pirate Coast (as it used to oe called) have had four flourishing industries - piracy, slave—trading, gun-running^ and pearl-diving. The British, as the great Power most interested in the Gulf, found themselves compelled to put an end to the first three, and the Japanese nearly killed the last with their cultured pearls in the years before the war'. The history of British relations with the Coast in their early years is the history of the suppression of piracy. The piratical Arabs were then known collectively a.s Jowo.simis, from the family name of their Sheikhs, from whom the present-day Sheikhs of Sharja, Ras al Khaim and Kalba are descended. They made convincing pirates, as wo read from contemporary descriptions - 'They... are called Ja.simee; but God preserve us from them, for they are monsters. Their occupa.tion io piracy, end their delight murder; and to make it worse they give you the most pious reasons for every villainy they comit• They abide by^ the letter of the sacred volume, rejecting all commentaries and traditions, you are their captive, and you offer all you possess to save your life, they say, ’Noi it is v/ritten in the Qufan that it is unlawfuQ. to plunder the living, but we are'not prohibited in that sacred work from stxipping the dead!' So saying, they knock you on the head. But then, that is not so much their fault, fdr they are descended from a Houl, or monster, and act according to their nature.' But they had their virtues, as we read else where - 'The most undaunted bravery was certainly theirs. IX taken, they submitted with resignation to the fate they inflicted on others; and when they fell into the hands of the Persians, or any nations by which they were surrounded, they were never spared. x.fter the destruction of one oi mxr forts, several of then were brought on board one of our ships as prisoners. While uncertain of their fate, and before their wounds were dressea, it ^as asked what treat aont they anticipated. 'The sane imediate death as wo should have inflicted on you, had your fortune been ours 1 , was the stern and characteristic reply.' At first, while they plundered cAl local vessels indiscriminately, they were careful to respect all foreign shipping, and British captains had the strictest orders never to provoke them in any way; but, in 1797&gt; ^ 1 ship was forcibly detained by them for two days. When no retaliation w~.s forthcoming they grew bolder, and another British.ship (from which they had previously borrowed the powder and shot necessary) was attacked. The British put up with this sort of thing until 1806 when the pmaatc fl-ot was blockaded at Qishm end forced to sue for peace. The Jowasi -us /promisoa■ mamma EB -15- XIIDIV promised to restore cirptured vessels and 'to respect the flag and property of the Honourable Hast India Company and their subjects'; but the lesson v/as not sharp enough and the attacks soon began again, and spread from the v/est coast of India to the Red Sea* A typical case we.s that of the 'Minerva” which, after a running fight of two days, was carried by boarding 'The commander, with full knowledge of the druel fate which awaited him, attempted to blov/ his vessel up, but unfortunately failed, and the slaughter of the victims commenced* The ship was first ‘purified’ with water and perfumes, and, this accomplished, the different individuals were bound and brought forward singly to the gangway, where one of the pirates cut their throats, in the name of God*' The pirate fleet had by now grown to nearly 1,000 ships manned by over 19,000 men, and the East India Company decided to_.take activg„..measures •- against them* An expedition accordingly sailed ±i(^S0^ r ~vm .ch captured and burnt Ras al Khaima, with the pirate vessels in rfafT port# Lingeh was treated in the same way, but the lesson was soon forgotten and piracy broke out again ten years later* Another expedition v/as sent, which did the job more thoroughly, and the pirate chiefs signed a General Treaty of Peace in 1820, which incidentally included an anti-slavery clause* This treaty, however, while outlawing piracy, did not prohibit inter-tribal warfare at sea, which, in practice, was almost the same thing, and in 1855 the chiefs v/ere persuaded to sign a six-month maritime truce prohibiting all hostilities by sea. This enabled them to oarry on their pearl-diving without interruption and proved such a boon to all of thorn that they readily agreed to renew it annually until 1843 1 then for ten years, and finally, in 1853, for ever* Since then the Pirate Coast has been knov/n as the Trucial Coast, and the truce has remained substantially unbroken. The keynote of British relations with the Trucial Sheikhs was then, and still is to-day, 'You may do what you like on dry land, but you may not fight or rob on the sea.' Since then Sharja and Dibai have become refuelling points on the air route to India, various other Sheikhs have agreed to allov/ emergency landing-grounds to be constructed and used in their territories, and the Government of India has provided a Post Office and dispensary in Dibai. Most of the Sheikhs have agreed to allov/ Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., to prospect for oil in their territories, but it is as well to remember that the presence of foreigners in their country is a novelty to which the local people *iuist take time to become accustomed, and that we should take every care to make our impact on them as gentle as possible. The Sheikhs are independent Arab rulers in special treaty relations with the British Government, and they are jealous of their independence* British and other foreign interests are looked after by a Political Officer at Sharja, wuo is subordinate to the Political agent at Bahrein, and, in his absence, by an Arab official knov/n as the Residency Agent. ? VI. Muscat and Oman i^/£&gt;tate of Muscat lies, strictly speaking, outside the Persian Gulf, presents many points of similarity to the other Arab States and Th but it presents many points of similarity comes vdthin the sphere of the Political Resident. lifter Saudi Arabia it is the largest of the .^rab States in population (500,000) and in area, consisting of the mountainous promontory at the head of Ras Masandam, together with the coastal strip from Murair, 50 miles to the south, right round the corner to the x^rovince of Dhofar (capital, Salalah), half-way along the south-eastern coast of Arabia* It is ruled by His Highness Sir Said bin Taimur,!*^ 01 * Sultan of Muscat and Oman* Oman is the name applied to the nx)UiiTOinous interior, which owes allegiance to a religious leader known as the Imam of Oman, v/ho, although they both cone of the same family, is in practice independent of the Sultan and has been at war with him in the past. /TheSB -16- XIIDIV The Inon hc.s no rolations with foreign Powers, but the Sultan has coixiercial treaties with the U.S.i.., Franco and Holland, as well as with Great Britain, The people of iiuscat have had trade connections with East Africa for centuries, and the Sultan of ;iuscawt was also Sultan of Zanzibar until 1856, The two Sultanates wore finally separated in 1861, under the rule of two brothers, after Great Britain had iiTodiatod in their quarrel* ^ The capital, ..iuscat, said to be the hottest town in the world, is the residence of the Political ^gent and has a landing ground, Post Office and hospital provided by the Governncnt of India. There are good harbours, there and at the larger town of Hatrah nearby, but the Sultan spends most of the year at Salalah, in his fertile province of Dhofar* There is a trained force of 150 levies and a snail police force, as well as a large nurber of tribal irregulars, but the Sultan relies chiefly on the promise of help from the British against aggression from the interior* He has an Advisory Council, a Minister for External Affairs and another for the Interior, and Walis, or local governors, reside at most of the larger towns. Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., have acquired the right to prospect for oil in the territories of the Sultan. There is no pearl-diving except from Has Hasan dan. In 1939, the Sultan, in con-ion with the other Arab rulers of the Persian Gulf, offered all the help in his power to the British Government. VI. RELIGION :u€) xAMBRS The customs and manners of the Arabs are conditioned by their climate and religion. The less said about their climate the better, but it is important to know something about their religion. Six hundred years after Christ, Arabia, was a battleground of savage and primitive tribes who worshipped numberless aspects of the one Divine Essence, known as Al-lat, often symbolised by trees and stones. They had no universal law or code of behaviour, for neither Christianity nor Judaism had made appreciable headway among them. Then Mohammed appeared and called the people to the worship of the One, the only, God, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob - and of Jesus. After early vicissitudes, the new religion made remarkable headway, and in a few years welded the iurab tribes into one inspired whole. Their armies carried their faith to India and lialaya in the east, Hbrocco and Spain in the west, the Balkans and central Asia in the north, and to Africa in the south. And for all those countries the Qur’an, the Muslin scriptures, provided a code of law and behaviour usually preferable to any they had had before. The central pillar of Islam is that there is only one God, and the making of pictures and images of non or boasts is therefore forbidden, since man, in thus usurping the function of the Creator, cannot nevertheless imbue his creation with a soul. For this reason mosques as a rule are simple and austere, decorated only by texts from the Qur'an with geometrical motifs. Muslims must pray five times a day, and must wash their faces, han&lt;£&amp;‘|»And their feet before prayer; thev are forbidden to drink '.vine or to emt the flesh of pigs. For one month in the year (jtomdan) they may not eat, drink, or smoke between sunrise and sunset. They may hive four wives at a, time, but only the very uich can.afford to have mere iixn otii Muslims have many ritual duties lc*id upon them. They hold that Jesus Christ and the Old Testament prophets wore true prophets, but that Mohammed, coming after them, modified and purified many of their teachings and is therefore to be followed where there is disagreement. Remember, when you see Muslims praying, that they are worshipping the same God we worship, and that they are very serious about it. Never interrupt thorn or pass near them. There is a tacit understanding in xurab countries that Christians hold to their own religion, and respect that of the Muslims, and .vice versa . Zurabs arc sensitive about their religion and are quick to resent any real or imagined slight,, so one must be careful not to give offence and, unless one is on very intimate terms, it is safest not to discuss religion with then. /CloselyEB -17- XITDIV Closely bound up with religion is the question of women* ilusliiu custom enjoins that women should conceal their faces from all men except their husbands and near relations, and this injunction is strictly followed by the ilrabs* (in Persia, however, the unveiling of women was ordered by the late ^■sShah as part of his campaign to westernise the country, and the more well-to-do -Persian women have adopted western drcss^l In some eastern countries the local women mix freely with European men, but this is emphatically not the case in nrabia, and even a glance or a word may be a serious matter* The Arabs are very jealous of the honour of their women and are quick to shed blood in defence of them, so that a man who has relations with a*«tf)man who is not his wife is often killed by her husband or brother: but still more often, it is the woman who is killed by her father or brother for bringing disgrace on the family. For a Christian to have dealings with a Muslim woman is the surest way of starting trouble - and serious trouble - for the affair is looked upon as an insult from one race to another and from one religion to another* Finally, the only Muslim women who would accommodate a Christian would be the lov/est type of prostitutes, and these are riddled with all known varieties of venereal disease* Vhen meeting Arabs remember that they are generally much more leisurely than we are, so take your time when discussing business with them* Besides being unhurried, you should be quiet and dignified - boisterousness is considered very bad manners. Usually, in an Arab assembly, the seats farthest from the door are for the exalted and those nearest the door for the lowly of station* It is good manners to remember the Biblical injunction and take a lowly seat. You will then be pressed to 'go up higher' and may, with becoming reluctance, comply. Normally, the visitor and the visited confine their conversation for the first few minutes to repeated formal enquiries after each other* s health. Coffee and perhaps sweetmeats arc then brought and business may be discussed. Two or three cups of coffee must be accepted and you should then shake the cup as you hand it back to the servajit as a sign that you have had enough. Eat the food only with your right hand, never touch it with your left; among Easterners the left hand is reserved for unclean tasks end is never used for eating. You should not point the sole of the foot towards an -.irab or stretch your legs out in front of you if you are sitting on the floor. In Kuwait and Iraq it is a sign that the guests should take their leave when the .host calls for the incense to be passed round, but the passing of incense does not have this significance farther down the Gulf* It is usually not possible when receiving Arabs to arrange for all this ritual, but if a reputable *irab comes to see you he should always be offered a chair and any refreshment (except alcohol) that may be going* If you give him a meal, serve no pork in any form* Most iirabs will not eat meat unless the animal, while still alive, has had its throat cut to the accompaniment of prayer* You nay have heard that Orientals are cunning and deqeitful, and some of them no doubt are, but remember that they have no monopoly of these failings; never atteupt to employ these arts when dealing with them, or you will be in for trouble. They have come to expect good faith and straightforwardness from us, and these will pay you best* Politeness costs only a little effort and will pay big dividends in willing co-operation, and by treating the people among whom you live with courtesy and kindness and by showing every consideration for their point of view you will be doing your country a service* NOTE ON CURRENCY. 128 - 130 rials ® £ 1 (standard Rate). 1 rial a 100 dinars Bronze Coins: 3,10,50 dinars.

In the Arab estates Indian currency is used. The unit is the rupee (13-j rupees a £l) and it is divided into 16 annas. One rupee equals Is, 6d., and three rupees are nearly equal to one, dollar.

In Saudi Arabia the currency unit is the silver dollar (rial) worth about Is, 2d, but the rate fluctuates a lot. The rial is worth 22 piastres (girsh; plural, gurGsh) which are copper or nickel coins. There are silver coins representing rial and ^ rial, British gold sovereigns are also widely used and at present each sovereign is worth about 40 rials.

This is, I think, already fairly clear, except for the fact that it is written under the name of Captair Tandy who is, of course, as political Officer on the Trucial Coast, one of the Political Resident's officers.

When Captain Tandy, the Political Officer on*^*? ^ 7 ’» the Trucial Coast, was on leave here recently, he suggested unofficially that it might be a good idea if a booklet could be prepared in an easily readable form on the political status* customs and history of the people living in the Persian Gulf area. He told us that many of the service personnel, for instance, including the Americans who are now stationed in the Gulf, have no idea about the position of the political Rulers, the customs of the Arabs and so forth, and that he had offrcw been asked to give talks on the subject^a^. partiau3Q^*4y»by the American airmen at Sharjah. He said that he would be willing, if desired, to write something while he was on leave here. We discussed the matter with the Foreign Office, and we agreed that the idea was a good one. The Foreign Cffice then approached the Ministry of Information (see their letter of 11th July) who also agreed with the suggestion, and Captain Tandy went ahead and produced quite a readable and interesting pamphlet. The Ministry of Information sent this to us for our comments, and we referred it, as a matter of- courtesy part ioujarly since Captain Tandy was one of the Political Residents officers, to the Political Resident. He has now replied in his letter of the 23rd November below, which takes a rather cantankerous and tiresome line. He seems to be making altogether too heavy weather of it, anl not to have realised the purpose of the booklet. Clearly, some of the remarks might be resented by^bovernments, e.g. of Persia and Iraq, if it came into their hands, but the intention was, I think, that it should be a confidential publication, and there is no reason why the Governments in question should ever have cause to take oSf-ioiql notice of it. In any case, what is said is not particularly * offensive•The Ministry of Information have already got the pamphlet in hand? though we had warned them that we would probably have some amendments to suggest when the Political Resident’s views were received. It is now submitted that we should go ahead with the proposal and should write to the Ministry of Information as in the attached draft. l( ^ ^ jvT’A- fatw- H/i. 1 C. /'-A.. 4ct*-** ^ l^’ ^tz s. ^ s ^&lt;0% vl- &lt;. £ ~-tLL {/**&lt;* Ce *-— t u-c, j|s&gt; ' c~ C*~&lt;- I^T' ^ lM.iL. f'-t l a-w- 1 ^ i^-c (Z tZL, t ArlUc c*—H Ou~^' 'V' * * R ' C ^ vV bb (L&amp;~ Psjd.

(fc-iRfvuj (/n. Peel, Lsquire, C.B.L., L.C., The India Office, . LONDON.THE PERSIAN GULP. You mil find the Persian Gulf strange and the people stranger still. You will find it difficult to understand where one country ends and the next begins r aud who runs which. Host of all you will find the manners, customs, ana way of living odd and incomprehensible. But these people are men of like passions with ourselves, and there is much in their ways which you ;w©ul4 admire if you kn#/ them better. The places you see, although hot, barren, and quite unlike home, are full of interest if you look at them with understanding. The countries bordering the Persian Gulf have a great and growing international, importance; and, in travelling to these countries, you have an opportunity which nmury people who must stay at home would envy; but to make the most of this opportunity you must know something of what goes on around you. Such knowledge will enable you to avoid giving offence and, perhaps, making a fool of yourself. In many places the people have seen so few British and Americans that they judge our entire nations by the behaviour of the few they meet. Always remember that you are, in this sense, an ambassador of your country.^ Don’t staid; with the idea that the Persian Gulf is Persian; it isn’t. More than half its shore-line belongs to various Arab States and less than half to Persia; and the Gulx itself, although the strait joining it to the Indian Ocean is only twenty-mine miles wide, is a part of the high seas and therefore free for all beyond the limits of territorial waters, who go there earn our living either on the Persian shore or in one of the Arab States, but we tcdk about being*posted to the Persian Gulf and * serving in the Persian Gulf* rather as if we were fish; and this perhaps reflects the essentially maritime nature of our connection with the Gulf^j In the past we regarded its waters as a highway for our ships, and to-day we regaro its air as a highway for our planes: its shores we have always regarded, and still regard, as the property of those who live on them. During oho two centuries, when Britain has been the paramount Yfestera power in those waters she has ■ un n' ' ' no conquests. Not only is the Persian Gulf a highway between East and West and the front door to Persia, Iraq, and the States of North Eastern. Arabia, but it is an important racial and political frontier.* On one side of it arc the Persians, or]-2 tho other the Arabs - different spealcing different languages,mth different ideals and ways of life; and they belong to different rcligioiis sects. It is differences^ and we shall return to the subject later. Finally the Persian Gulf is important as the site of oil-fields present and future. Up to date the volume of oil from the Gulf area is small in ccmparisan with American or Russian output, but oil-fields are not inexhaustible and the time may come when the emptying of fields elsewhere may give the oil of the Persian Gulf a greatly increased significance. Properly to understand the present set-up it is necessary to know a little of the history of the Gulf, and this you will find in the next chapter. The first Europeans to oe seen m rorce an tno Persian Gulf were Greeks. Three hundred years before Christ that remarkable man Alexander the Great marched an army of Macedonians and Greeks to the conquest of India, but, finding the country larger and hotter than they liked, they decided to come home bjr way of the Gulf, Alexander, with part of the array, marched from near Karachi through South Persia to the Basra area, while another detachment, under his admiral Nearchus, sailed with the heavy equipment in 1,800 small and unsafe ships along the North shore of the Gulf.- The journey took them from early November 326 B.C. to late February 325 B.(i, and from what has been recorded of their experiences it may bo inferred that none of them were keen to repeat it. Nevertheless Alexander sent expeditions to explore the S^outh shore of the Gulf and had oraered Nearchus to try to sail round Arabia to Suez when ho died in 3^3 B.C. before ever he reached The next on the scene were the Portuguese and it was apparently pepper that brought them. Our European ancestors of the kiddle Ages seem to have had a rare fondness for pepper and other spices from the East, and for those they were prepared to pay well. Persia, India, and China also produced finely manufactured essential for one who has to live and mix with them to have some idea of th e x 4 rfvSXx -hp***) home. goods, silks, and brocades, the demand for which was possibly created by our ancestors 1 wives; the demand was certainly furious. These thing? had to fina-3- thcir way to the Mediterranean overland, through the Persian Gulf, or through the Red Sea, and the cost of transporting then was so high that it was soon realised that a f.^,une awaited anyone who could operate an ,all-sea route to India,. The Portuguese were the first on to it, and Vasco da Gama 1 s voyage round the Cape of Good Hope to India in 1498 was one of the most significant events in all the history of the East. The Portuguese then planned to send their ships to India to fetch the merchandise and to stop the traHe up the Persian Gulf and the Red sea which was, at the time, being profitably carried on by Arab merchants. The first thing the inoffensive Arab merchants knew was the arrival of the Portuguese Admiral Affonso de Albuquerque, at the head of a squadron of si:: warships, at Ras ul Hadd, the Easternmost corner of Arabia. It is difficult to improve on the oldest account of his proceedings there, * And they found there... 30 or 40 fishing ships, which were come thither from the city of Ormuz, Calayate, and all that coast to fish..,* and they burned all these ships, and on the follovdng morning set sail v/ith a. fair wind, and took the ships^oats with masts and sails’. At Quryat, farther up the coast, *He was ill received, and storming the town, not with a vigorous opposition, but entered with the death of 80 of the enemy and loss of three Portuguosesj after the plunder the place was burnt and with it 14 vessels that v/ere in the harbour. Hence he sailed eight leagues further to Mascate...’ So it went on: and we should remember that this was the Arabs first introduction to Christian Europeans. Finally de Albuquerque captured Hormuz which must then have been very different from the unimpressive ruins which may still be seen on the island of that name near Bandar Abbas. According to writers of the tiro it was, 'as bigge as Exetex' 1 , the buildings faire and spacious...* and,'doing more trade in its best days than London and Amsterdam combined 1 ; and Milton wrote of ’The wealth of Ormuz and of Ind’, During nearly a hundred years while they had things much their own way, except for some Turkish opposition from the direction of Iraq, the Portuguese built forts along the Batina coast, at Muscat, Hormuz, and Bahrain, dominating completely^ the trade and politics of the Persian Gulf, while the Pope confirmed their king in his title of 'Lord of the Conquest, Navigation and Commerce of India, Ethiopia, Arabia, and Persia.' Possibly it was too much accent on the Conquest and not enough on the Commerce which made tha prosperity of Hprouz dooline under their management /and,ana, more serious, brought upon thorn tho disapproval of one of the greatest non who ever led Persia - Shah Abbas. In 1602 ho drove then from Bahrain and in 1620 fron a position they occupied near Has ul Khaimah on the Trucial Coast, .1c in the years between he established a new port, which he named Bandar Abbas after himself, as a rival to Hormuz. During the sane years various enterprising Englishmen took advantage of the security prevailing throughout Persia under Shah sobas to Visit his Court, and the King of Spain (who had subjugated Portugal in 1580) sent a succession of priests to represent him. Shah Abbas, however, did not hold with priests and wrote to the king that 'Ho was weary of receiving Priors as Ambassadors' and asking to be sent 'sane Spanish Gentleman of Note' instead 'for he should know better how to treat with such a one, and God and His Majesty would be better served, because a religious man out of his cell was like a fish out of water'. The Shah got his Spanish Gentlemen of Note, who peremptorily demanded tho restitution ox cextain places lately conquered by the Persians and the exclusion of -he x.ngli^h and .11 other Europeans fron the Persian trade. 'This was too much for the Shah who tore up the letters and swore that, so far from restoring what he had already taken, ne would /rive the Portuguese from their fortress at Hormuz; while he ordered a Farman to be made out granting the sole trade in silks by the route English'. The Shah kept his word, but, since then, hundreds of Europeans have repeated the Spaniard's mistake. Never try, like the Spanish Gentleman of Note, to *be high-handed with the Persians# Rather typically it was a large consignment of unsaleable broadcloth that firs, brought the British to Persia, but to make the matter clear ic is neceosary to go back a little. The defeat of the Spanish Anaoda in 1588 made the English realise that there was no reason to continue lotting the Spanish and Portuguese monopolise such a good thing as the Eastern trade, and in the year 1600 Queen Elizabeth was pleased'to grant a charter to 'The Governor and Company of the Merchants of London trading into the East Indies', who proceeded to establish a trading-post or 'factory' at Surat on the West coast of India. Their object was 'by xoir means xo obtain quiet and peaceable trade' but the Portuguese saw fit to interfere and had to bo defeated in two sea-battles off Surat in 1612 and 1615. ^ so we get back to our broadcloth, which was then England's chief article of exporw. The Company their vats' end to know how to dispose of a largo consignment of it which hadarrived at Surat, and which the Indians (and you can hardly blame them considering the climate) showed no eagerness to buy. They thought they saw light when they hea:&gt;^from a traveller that in Persia they might be assured *of the vente of much cloth, in regard their country is much cold, and men, women, and children are clothed therewith some five months of the year 1 , and they established their first factory in Persia at Jask with others at Shiraz and Isfahan. The Portuguese fleet, of course, interfered again and was defeated in a hot battle off Jask in 1620 . In 1622 the British did an odd thing. The Persians, who were besieging Hormuz with a land army (Shah Abbas was keeping his word to the Spanish ambassador) and much needed help from the sea, demanded with threats and promises the assistance of a British fleet which happened to be nearby. Although Bn gland and Spain were at peace^ the 'Company agreed^ and the fleet joined forces with the Persians to drive out the unfortunate Portuguese. The Persians took the lion’s share of the loot and practically demolished Hormuz which never again raised its head; but Portuguese power in the Gulf was broken and the English opened a factory at Bondar Abb as which remained the centre of their activities in the Gulf for IfjO years* There was one relieving feature of the incident, of a nature unusual at that time. In oho words of a Portuguese historian, ’The English Captains have performed their premise made upon yield-up of the Castle, by giving two of their own ships or pinasses to carry away all the people whither they would goe, also by defending then that at no tine neither Moore nor Infidell should do there any hurt:...and more, they have given hospitality to our sick and wounded, which are neere about two hundred at the least, whom they have sustained and cured with as great care and diligence as if they had beene their own brothers’ The British, however, were far from being out of the wood: during tho succeeding years they had to compete with the far more formidable rivalry of the Dutch East India Company which had also established itself at Bandar Abbas. The Dutch proved astute and unscrupulous traders, and, as their company was run as a State enterprise with the whole-hearted backing of the government, they soon drew ahead of the English company which was a private undertaking with lukewarm government support. The conduct of the Persians was exasperating to both Dutch and English, and the /butchDutch in I 65 O used force to coerce then* This, though it temporarily increased their ascendancy, redounded to their disadvantage an the long run, for,the Persians did not forget it* The position of the English conpanj' - was strengthened aoc-t 1700 by the amalgamation with it of various competing companies and bjr more determined government support, and frith the turn of the century came the turning-point in their fortunes. This was signalised in a typically Oriental manner - the Shah of Persia decided to honour the British factory at Isfahan with a State visit* ’Mr.Bruce, the Ccmapny* s a.gent and oJLl the factory, great and small, were ordered to leave their house, and chamber doors and warehouses all open, for His Majesty and his Seraglio oenpaniens to ramble thro*, and tolce such things as best pleased him and his t minions; and there was a table left in the Dining Room spread with the richest sweetmeats and fruit. I believe the Company was not very ambitious of having such honours conferred on them, since they were obliged to pay for them’. £12,000 the bill came to, but, odd as it nsy seen, the Dutch tried their best to secure a similar honour from the Shah, and failed. The Shah’s goodwill proved well worth the money and British fortunes forged ahead, but unfortunately it was not long before Persia entered on a period of anarchy, so that the trade declined and, for 'neordy a hundred lean years it seemed hardly worth while hanging on* The French, too, established themselves at Bandar Abbas, and, although they never proved dangerous rivaJLs in trade, they caused serious inconvenience during the periodic wars of the 18th century* The Bandar Abbas factory was closed down in 17&amp;3 end another opened at Bushire, while, for a few years in the interval, Basra was the centre of British commercial activity. About this time the competition of the Dutch finally faded out as they tended to concentrate their attention more on their Far Eastern possessions, and, since then, the British, with their headquarters at Bushire, have remained the paramount power in the Persian Gulf. The story of what they have done and have not done, during these hundred and eighty years when they have had the power to do anj^thing they wished must form another chapter. III. ’THE MOST UNSELFISH PAGE IN HISTORY.* In 1763, when Britain found herself alone in the field of commercial competition, the Gulf was in a state of chaos, uncharted and unbuoyed, and infested by pirates and the roving war-fleets of Arab potentates. For many years relations between \ /Persia# -7- Persia and the Arabs had beer governed by, ! The ancient law, the simple plan, ^ That he shall take who hath the power, And he shall keep who can 1 , and, roughly between the years sixteen and seventeen hundred, the Persians had done the taking* At various times they had occupied nearly all the Arab coast Prom Basra to Mascat but^ as disorders in Persia increased^their hold on these places slipped, and, from about 1700, the Arabs controlled the entire south shore and dominated parts of the Persian coast, notably the Lingeh corner. It was therefore the Arabs, and prominent amongst them the Wahhbi^, who provided the British authorities v/ith moot of their problems, and the first problem was piracy, A AL a/ The WaJaabii were the follcrwers of a puritan reformer named I4 .j1iuu.icd1 A T Waliab who set out to clean up Islam* They were Bedouin of central Arabia, tough, savage, fanatical, and recklessly brave, and their hand was turned as much against other Muslims who disagreed with their ideas as against Christians, They captured the port of Qatif in 1§Q0 and their hold soon spread to the whole Arab shore o^llir^ Gulf, whose inhabitants found it convenient to conform to their tenets - particularly the principle of plundering persons of other religious views. This naturally gave a fillip to piracy, for which the men of the Persian Gulf in general and of the Pirate Coast (now Trucial Coast) in particular had long been notorious, so that no ship of any nationality, unless heavily aimed or convoyed, was sxfe anywhere between India and Africa. The story of the pirates will be told in the section on the Trucial Coast but here it is just necessary to mention that the Bast India Company sent an expedition against them in 1809, and a little later a Turko-Egyptian army under Mohaijed Ali Pasha, an Albanian soldier who had risen to become Viceroy of Egypt under the Turks and from whom the present King of Egypt is descended, advanced against th6 from the WOst. Although the Wa^bij/ v/ere commanded by their great leader, the jjair Sa'ud, ancestor of the present ling of Saudi Arabia, tnc Egyptians over-ran their countxy and reached the Persian Gulf at Hasa an 1818. By this time the British, who had been too lenient with the pirates after their first expedition, found themselves compelled to send ‘another, and they deputed one of their officers, an Irish captain called Sadleir, to secure the co-operation of the Egyptians. Wien Sadleir reached Hasa he discovered that the Egyptians, who found /Arabia- 8 -' Arabia too large, turbulort, ord barren to hold, had already begun to vdthdravv westwards, but his orders were to oontact them, so he followed. The further bo v-ont the further they retreated until, after untold difficulties and dangers, ho cr.o out on the shores of the Red Sea, his horse dying under him just as he arrived. His crossing of Arabia, alone and at that date, is a feat of courage and endurance which deserves to be remembered. The edition (undertaken, of course, without any help from the Egyptians) was successful, and a general Treaty of Peace was signed m 1820 by -which the Arabs bound themselves to abandon piracy 'against any nation whatsoever'. Britain thus wen security for the ships of all nations trading to the Persian Gulf. m the succeeding years British officials applied themselves to eliminating the perpetual sea-warfare prevailing between the Arab tribes, and a Treaty of Peace in Perpetuity was si^ed in 18 5 3. Tbis provided for the cessation of all var-like acts at sea, victims of aggression being required not to retaliate but to report the matter to the British authorities, and was an immense boon to all concerned. Vfith what the Arabs did to each other cn land Britain did not concern herself, but tho peace at sea has continued unbroken to this day* Britain's next problem was the Slave trade. She had herself taken a loading part in it at one time and, as was fitting, she took the lead in suppressing it,^starting -as early as 1772. throughout tha BnU i nil ilinmm-aio hed hovn -|^ a r..tAd an d th' bulu„L&gt; hud hem uI iqh? ad&gt;-»*’*■&gt; th0 laW of th ° Qoran, the buying and selling of negroes and of prisoners of war who refuse tc become Muslims is legal, and tho law of the Qoran is the law of the Arab States of the Persian Gulf to this day.

Elsewhere it frequently happens that a slave who, after a tiff with his master, has ccno to the Political Agent and demanded his freedom, spends a few weeks earning his living as a free nan in a world of free competition and then, returning to his master, begs to be taken back into the comfort and security of slavery# /^Further to interfere for the sake of appearances with this old and not inhumane institution, sanctioned, by religion and bound up, as it is, with social and econcmic noeds, would only '.rouse anti- foreign feeling while doing doubtful good to the slaves themselves^ A T o account oi the suppression of slavery in these waters would be caroplete which did not mention the untiring and selfless everts of the men of the Po 3 r al Navy and the Indian Navy who, for scores of years, under terrible climatic and living conditions, maintained the ceaseless patrol which did more than any treaty in making all efforos to ship slaves simply not worth while. During the nineteenth century a cable and (later) wireless syscem through the Gulf was established linking India with Europe and providing inter-communication between the Persian and Arab coastal ports. At the same time the Gulf was accurately surveyed by personnel of the Royal and Indian Navies and a series of charts prepared which have since proved an inestimable boon to the shipping of all nations* {he same may be said for the establishment of lighthouses and the placing cf buoys wherever required^ p* / Public health was also a primary concern of the British Author!,ties, and statistical and meteorological, information was collected# Quarantine arrangements were made at all the larger ports so that the incidence of plague was much diminished and the scourge of cholera banished from the Persian Gulf, The Island of IQiarag (north-west of Bushire) was occupied in 18^-10^2and again in l3'!-l6£ S ir the course of hostilities which broke out between Great Britain and Persia auring which the British also took Bushiro and ShuiTaashaltr (then called Muharamerah) and sent an aimy as far as Abwaz. At this time the Turics, who controlled Iraq, also claimed a shadowy suzerainty over Kuwait, Has a, and Q#tar, /Lord- 10 - I Lord Curzon summed up Britain 1 s position at that time in a speech to the Trucial Chiefs in 1903, ’Sometimes I think that the record of the past is in danger of being forgotten ••• We saved you from extinction at the hands of your neighbours. opened these seas to the ships of all nations and enabled their flags to fly in peace.

We are not now going to throw away this century of costly and triumphant enterprise; we shall not wipe out the most unselfish page in history...fhe peace of these waters must still be maintained; your independence will continue to bo upheld; and the influence of the British Government must remain supreme. * Although this may read a trifle bombastically now, and we should be inclined to a modification, or at least to a less forthright expression, of these opinions, the position then was different. What amounted to an international rush for the Persian Gulf was in pro gress. ’The French, whose status in Kuscat was nominally identical with that of Great Britain, desired to secure a coaling station there in 1895&gt; Russia, in the endeavour to enlarge her sphere of influence, sent Various missions thither, ostensibly to establish a ’warm water port’ to serve as a constant outlot for her trade, and heavily -subsidised a line of steamers frem the Black Sea; Turkey assumed control of wlli^le^states on the western littoral, claiming suzerainty ovc,r Hasa and. Bahrain ana even Oman, and endeavouring to bring within her orbit the long-autonomous principality of Kuwait; while Germany, in pursuance of her Oriental policy and the realization of her dream of a through route from Hamburg to the Persian Gulf, spared no pains to obtain a solid footing under the guise of commercial expansion,..’ “There was, at the t time, a flourishing trado in modem rifles from Kuscat across the Gulf to South Persia, whence they reached warlike Afghan tribes who used them to disturb the peace of British India, and most of Persia and Arabia was armed fren the same source, many of these arms arrived in French ships, and the protection of the French flag was used, goo,' by many of the Ahows engaged in the Slave Trade. All these causes of faction v;ere eradicated by the establishment of the Entente Cordiale with France, and rivalry vath Russia abated after the signing of the Anglo-Russian convention of 190? which constituted the Persian Gulf a British sphere of influence. In 191A a British army passed through the Persian Gulf to Iraq whore it fought a prolonged and arduous campaign resulting in the liberation of that country from Turkish domination and its establishment as an independent Arab state, 'Most of /fiast)'I pippy,!^. .^xpjipmi - 11 - East Persia was occupied too as a preliminary to the formation of a coition to prevent German agents infiltrating free Turkejr into Afghanistan with the object of instigating that country'' to attack India* This gavo the Germans an opportunity of playing on Persian patriotism, and their agent Wassrauss succeeded in raising tho Qashgai tribe in the hinterland of Bushire and in diverting the best part of a division of British troops, an exploit which other of their agents have endeavoured to emulate in this war* It is now time to turn to the Persian Gulf as it is to-day, and oo keep the distinction clear, we will deal with Persia and the Arab States separately, but, before doing so it would perhaps be as well to explain the system of Political control which has been ©volved* The chief representative of British interests in the Political Resident in uho Persian Gulf, whose headquarters are at Bushire. V^sj-j^jU the Persians he is Consul-General for Bushire and the Persian ports in the Gulf. There are also Consuls at Khurramshahr, Bushire, and Bandar Abbas, mth a British Consular Agent at lAngeh. On the Arab side he controls Political Agents at Kuwait, Bahrain^nd to cat, and, subordinate to the Political Agent at Bahrain, aPolitical Officer on the Trucial Coast, These Political Agents are nothing to do with elections* They are the representatives of the British and Indian Governments in the territorf.es to which they are posted, and discharge the functions of Consuls besides doing many things which an canary Consul does not have to do. As it is obviously not desirable that Europeans and im.erao^ should have to submit to Arab courts and Qoranic law, all foreigners are sublet to the civil and criminal. Jurisdiction of the Political Agent. Joint Courts consisting of the Political Agent and the Sheilch, or, for rinor cases, of the Assistant Political Agent and one of the Sheiih's relations, are held to try cases in which formers and the Sheikh' s. subjects are both involved. As the sole representative, not only of Britain, i u, oi all ,or^so countries, the Political Agent naturally can and does influence and guide .he Sheikh in many matters lying beyond the scope of treaties. Mergers of the Allied forces should only have dealings with the local authorities through the Political Agent who is best able to ensure that the of co-operation is secured from the Arabs while their rights and susceptibilities are respected by the allies, (or, with the frills off, to see that the Arabs pl^r ball and we don't tread on their /toes- 12 - toes norc than we have to)* Apart fron oil, the foreign trade of the Gulf is mostly \dth lambay, and the great majority of British Subjects living in the Gulf are Indians, For thes£§ as well as for historical reasons, the Political Officers are members of the Indian Political Service, appointed from India, and the policy they follow is the joint product of the Government of India aod the ^-Porei-gn-offiGo, The fact that some have rdlita^ rank while others do not merely shows that they entered the Service fron the Army and not from the/Givil Service, The rank signifies little - plain hr, may be more important than major, here as elsefvvhere, IV. THE PTIRSI,^ SHORE. Persia has a glorious past. Maybe she has a glorious future too, but you will find in her present rruoh that you want to criticise. Don’t: the Persians will never forgive j^ou. They are very sensitive about the imperfections of present- day Persia which most of them realise just as well as 3 'ou; and the ones that don’t realise are not worth telling. The Persians are an Aryan race and speak an Aryan language. This means that their language is similar to European languages and not to Arabic and Turkish, and that they possibly come of the same race as European nations. Although since then over-run by Mongols, Tartars, Turks, Arabs, and Afghans, the Persians have never been submerged: they have kept their language, traditions, and culture alive and have always absorbed their conquerors. Their language is a good one and has progressed linguistically much further than many European languages, butin the middle ages Persia adopted the Arabic writing and with it, many ijrabic words, . This has made Persian much more difficult for us to loam and understand, but j t is still worth learning. It has a store of poetry of a high order, and some of 'che ancient Persian poets have been translated into many of the languages of Europe, The Persians are proud of their origin arid justly proud of their language and literature. Four hundred years before Christ the warrior-king Darius, Lord of the ’Medes and Persians’ of Bible fame, led Persian armies through much of what later became South Russia and Rumania and attacked Greece, ’The King with half the East at heel is marched from lands of rooming, ’His fighters drink the river up, their shafts benight the air, 'And he that stands will die for nought and home there’s no returning’, /and-a3- V aud so forth# Darius also led his armies to Palestiro, Syria, and Egypt# For much of hor history Persia ruled Iraq, the Caucasus, and parts of central Asia#. The Persian king Nadir Shah conquered Afghanistan, and North India and roachod Delhi, where he hela a massacre of the civil population which is remembered to this day ~ almost exactly three hundred years after • The Persians are proud of their past military glories. There are also innumerable small things of which P?rsians are proud, such as their calendar, which is, in point of fact, more scientific and convenient than our ov/n, I have now told you three times that Persians are proud, and it is uhe first point to remember when dealing with them. They are also very polite, and, although such punctiliousness may appear to us somewhat ludicrous, it is best when meeting or speaking with then to use your most ceremonious manner. But they have their points. They are a witty, cheerful, friewlly people nuch addicted to gardens, flowers, and picnics, and are quick to respond to appreciation of these things in others. Modem Persians hate to be thought oriental. For the last twenty years they have been striving mightily to westernise and industrialise their country - an uphill task in vidch they have mde groat strides. They like foreigners to notice how much more western Persia is than Host of her neighoouro. There is a delicate point that should be touched on in preparing jrou for the Persians. In the days of Darius, we read, Persian youths were taught'to ride, shoot, and speak the truth'. These three subjects are noticably absent fron the curricula of modem Persian schools, and it is necessary to discount much of what you hear fron Persians, and to make ample allowance for exaggeration. It nay be that to tall the truth, they feel, would often be impolite or unpleasant, or, possibly, that Persians prize the truth as too valuable a commodity to be recklessly squandered on comparative strangers, r&amp;notherj Persian foible/^e should take account of is - let us face it - their Affection ior the Gomans. There are perfectly clear reasons for this and it is as well to understand them. There are two European nations of which the Persians feel that they have seen decidedly more than they want to - the Russians and the English. Advancing on Persia from two different directions they have hem*! her in during the last two hundred years and have both occupied territories which she considers her legitimate Icb^j^B* and Persia has begun to suffer from Claustrophobia. The dims* was reached in 1907 *en a convention was signed whereby At nv»'h'h-04- North Persia was agreed to be a Russian, South East Persia a British, and the Gulf wanted any part of Persia, but each feared that, if she kept out the other wou^fe walk in. Now things have been roore satisfactorily arranged by both countries agreeing to keep out after the war,) At that time units of the British and Russian armies were on Persian soil in the guise of ’Consular Escorts', and all this was a bitter blow to Persian pride* Then Germany appeared, a knight in shining armour, and, while from her distance herself presenting no threat to Persia, proceeded to attack both Britain and Russia* It seemed that Germany was fighting Persia's battles. Add to this thirty years of clever and insidious German propaganda, and the fact that Persians have seen only very few Germans and then never as enemies, and that Persia and Germany did much trade together in the years before this war, and you have the basis of the Persians' peculiar predilection. We shall never cure the Persians by patronising them or bul^dng them, but we may one day win them over by sympathy and friendliness* What I have said hitherto applies chiefly to educated Persians and the official class, but the Persian peasant, although he may not be so enthusiastic about westernisation, has roughly‘the same ideas in a mcdxficd form. Ho is a likeable fellow, i*«fj(uLdL o/lK. hardy and industrious, and very much On the whole one.does not see the best type of either on the Persian Gulf littoral: the villagers are, if anything, poorer and more down—trodden than elsewhere, and Persian ofiicials regard service in the Gulf as a penance and do their utmost to avoid it. Persia is the largest country abutting on the Gulf •* six times as big as Prance in area, and with a population of about 15,000,000 - considerably more than Canada* stationed in the main towns were the largest and best equipped on the Gulf, and she had an Air Force* She had a strong and detei^nined Shah who, riding on the wave of nationalism which was the natural result of the indignities Persia had suffered in the last war, set about seeing that Persia was mistress in her own house* He subdued rebellious tribes throughout the country and- reasserted Persian claims to the islands and opposite shore of the Persian Gulf* Persian customs officials excelled them selves in devising means of obstruction and petty annoyances, and the British, d owing shore West of Bandar Abbas a neutral sphere of influence (nitfrtljQr country, of course, Before the war she had a Navy consisting of four modem, fast, sloops. Her garrisons before the stem, abandoned the' u--*i ie islands of Hen jam and /Qishm-15- c n) Qisbn .which--they -h'gd ■ 'i!ij»ed hxd ooaliiBg—aonc, Similar difficulties wore net when it was proposed to establish an air-route to India along the Persian shore of the Gulf, anf^t become clear that the Persians did not desire the route to be administered by foreigners while not wishing to incur the responsibility and e:qpense of adninistering it themselves* Further, they demanded that the route should pass through Tehran. This was not considered practicable and the air-line was therefore organised to pass along the Arab shore, to which Britain has never admitted Persian claims. But, for the Persian G-ulf, the most momentous innovation was the construction of the trans-Persian railway from Bandar Shahpur, on the G-ulf, to Bandar Shah on the Caspian. During the whole of the nineteenth century the main route into the interior had been from Bus hire to Shiraz, and, in consequence, the port of Bushire had flourished at the expense of Bondar Abbas, During the last twenty years it has been the turn of Bushire to decline aii expoEwre of Bandar Shahpur, which has a much better harbour, and the trade of Persia has been concentrated at the head of the Gulf. In addition burdensome customs regulations and the corruption and rapacity of Persian officials far from the control of Tehran have made the lot of traders in the Gulf ports of Persia a most unhappy one, and the ports themselves present a dismal picture of depression and decay. Many of the merchants and thousands af shopkeepers, artisans, and labourers have emigrated to the Arab side, where freedom from irksome restrictions and Government control make life easier, and they have taken much of the trade with them. For instance, the market for pearls (the most important export, after oil, from the Gulf) has been entirely transferred from Lingeh to Dubai and other Arab ports, which have benefitted immensely. Abadan presents a vivid contrast. This island, near the head of the o-ulf, houses the largest oil refinery in the world. It draws its crude oil by pipe-line from the mountains of the interior and, in 1933, exported OOO/XDtens cf dl,ori which the Persian government received £ ,000,000 in royalties or ^ of the net profits. The concession on which the oil industry is based was given to the British in 190 and expires in 1993. The industry is now Persia's greatest after agriculture and employs 000 British and 10,000 Persian personnel. Bvery effort is being made to associate Persians more and more in the work and management of the company, and they fill many of the most responsible positions. It was largely with the help of the oil royalties that Persia managed to buid her railway at a coso of £30,000,000 /withoutwithout ‘borrovd.ng a penny abroad, and it na^'' safely be said that the concession has proved a boon to both Persia and Britain, The /JCohs thr;- V.

The Arab has no inferiority complex vis-a-vi s the European. He realises, of course, tho.t the Westerner has many material possessions that he has to do without, but he reflects that the Christian will roast in Hell for all eternity while the Muslim will be luxuriating in Hea\an* Considering that he has the best of the bargain he feels pity for us. rather than envy. The Arabs never forget that all men are equal in the sight of God and this makes them as democratic -as any people on earth. There is no word for ‘mister 1 lnj / p^±c - it simply is not needed.

He struck straight at his enemy's capital and was so successful that, after a series of desert wars lasting nearlj' thirty years, he built a kingdom reaching from Hasa on the Persian Gulf to A1 Hejaz on the Red Sea, and from the Great Dosort on the South to the borders of Palestine and Transjordan on the North, and containing more than 5,000,000 people.

He rules the Arabs by methods which they understand - and like. He has even stopped then stealing, an achievement incredible to those who knew Arabia before his advent. The Arabs tell a story of his justice that one of them came to his court and reported that he had seen two bags of grain.lying in the desert ’Hen* did you know that the bags contained grain?’, asked the Iving, *1 touched them with my finger.’ said the Arab, ’With which finger?' asked the King. ’With this one, ’Tho Arab answered, holding it up.

Oil in great quantities was struck in 1938 in the Dhahran area and work was just getting under way at the outbreak of war. About 1 00 ianericans live in a well-appointed air-conditioned village at Dhahran and a port as being devel oped at Has Tanura, American firms, in fact, hold oil concessions .tor nearly all Saudi Arabia - an area believed to contain reserves of oil much greater than those of Persia and Iraq ccrobined. Although Ibn Saud owns no big port on the Persian Gulf his influence there is nevertheless great. Had he not promised to maintain friendly relations with Persian Gulf statea having treaties with the British Government he would doubtless have opeorbed most of them before now, and their rulers, who fully realise this, hav® a deep respect and admiration for Ibn Saud and treat his wishes with deference*- 21 - Tho^e is no Politioal Agent or other British representative in Hasa, relations ■vdth Ton Sand being conducted through the British Idnister in Jodda on the Red Bea* ^hrain is an island thirty miles long by ten miles broad v/i^h of the t^rst climates in the v/orld.

The island of Bahrain with its satellite islands is tuiod by the ill Mhalifa fondly of the Utub tribe which invaded it from the mainland of Arabia in 1783 and conquered it. To this day they number only a few hundred fandlies and belong to the Sunni sect whereas their predecessors, the Baharina, belong to the opposition Shiah sect and number some 50,000 - half the population of the islands. There are 15,000 Persians of both sects and 1,000 Indians of several religions, so that sectarian strife is apt to cause trouble. The islanders also have to adapt themselves to M-A ~ presence of some 300 British and 100 Americans of tho oil conpanicj/. The Shoihh, ^ v;ho is an independent Arab ruler enjoying British protection, is Sir Salmon bin Hamad A1 Khalifa and to help him in his government he employs a British adviser Mr, D, Belgrave, He also has British experts to run the Customs, ungineciin^, Public Health, and Education departments, and a force of 358 armed police who are probably the best trained and organised in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain has gone in for education in a big way jMfld^here ase..boysparents find that education inomases the marriage-value of their daughters the Girls School, which owes its inception to the keeness and initiative of lirs,Belgrave, is also flourishing and there are mocy nor® applicants than there are vacancies,Hcnok 0 ;f amenities would exist v^re it not for the oil royalties^which, before the war, averaged per annum,^ ^iey are divided in the proportion of a third to the Shaikh for the expenses of his Government and the support of his numerous and exacting relatives, a thizd to the Municipalities of Manama and Muharraq, and a third to a sinking fund against the rainy day when the oil is exhausted. Oil was discovered in Bahrain in 1931 by the Standard Oil Company of California, who obtained a 55 years lease in 193A end formed tho Bahrain Petroleum Company, which va ao- is registered in Canada, Output in 1938 ms / tons, and the industry employs 75,000- 22 - 5,000 local people and is the mainstay of the island's prosper!tjp Under a clauso in their contract the. company must employ locals for whatever skilled work they are capable of, and they have accordingly founded a Technical School where the y^kh of the island nay acquire the necessary skills. After oil, pearling is the most important industry, and Bahrain is one of the centres of the world's pearl trade. Unlikely as it may seem, the sea is only warm enough for deep diving from June to September, and at the end of hoy about 400 boats with 15,000 divers leave for the banks. No modern apparatus is used: the divers just fasten a clip to their noses, take a mesh bag in one hand and a stone in the other, and go down - sometimes as deep as ton fathoms. They gather in the bag as many oysters as they can find in a minute or so, and then come up for a couple of minutes rest hanging on to a pole at the side of the boat. After about ton dives they come out of the water for a longer rest. It is very equating work, particu larly as only light meals can be eaten, and that not more than twice a day, In the evening they sit round and open the oysters. Sach boat pools its catch and every man from the captain to the cabin-boy gets his share according to old-establxsbeu custom. Seme of the best pearls in the world are found in the Gulf and the annual value of Bahrain's catch is sometimes over a million pounds sterling. Host of the pearls are bought by Indian merchants and re-sold in Bombay, whence, in peace-time, the pearls for the European market find their way to Paris. Tho pearl trade is so vital for the prosperity of the Arabs that any Arab who prejudiced it by introducing artificial or cultured pearls into the Gulf would be lucky if he escaped with his life, while the British authorities have always sternly discouraged attempts by European interlopers to exploit the pearling-banks by modern methods. Although fresh water from the highlands of Central Arabia, passing under hundiec.o ' c£ kii es of desert and under the sea, wells u P in Bahrein and in the sea around it. the island grows little besides dates and lucerne, and not nearly enough of these for its requirements.

Oil has been found and it is thought tot ihe ^mtuin out to be i large one. The Trucial Coast begins at the south-east comer of Qatar and runs for LOO miles to the village of Sha’ am near the tip of the Husandan peninsula. The mountainous head of the peninsula, belongs to the Sultanate of muscat; men tho Trucial Coast begins again at Dibbah and runs some fifty miles south to -oho ooro.r of Muscat territory at Murair. Reading from wost to east along the coast lie Trucial Sheikhdoms of Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Ita ul Qniwain, Has ul Khaimah, and Kalba. Besides these there are ot^er Sheikhdoms, such as Fujairah and Homriyeh, who, although they have established themselves as independent of the larger Sheikhdoms, are signatories to no truce and have, no treaties Vj/ith British Government. Inland practically no boundaries arc agreed on and the roving Bedouin pay allegiance to one Shaikh or to another - dr to none at all - an the spirit moves them. To understand the rather complex position it is necessary to go back and look briefly at the exceedingly interesting history of the Coast*In tho past the people of the Pirate Coast (as it used to, be called) have had four flourishing industries - Piracy, Slave-Trading, Cun-Running, and Pearl Diving. Tho British, as the chief v/estern power, found themselves compelled to out to the first throe and. the Japanese nearly killed the last with their cultured pearls in the years before the war. The history of British relations with the Coast in their early years is the history of the suppression of piracy. The piratical Arabs were then known collectively as Jowasimis from the family name of their Shaikhs, from whom the present-day Shaikhs of Sharjah, Has ul Khainah, and Kalba are descended. They made convincing pirates, as we read from contemp orary descriptions, ’They are Qf the sect of the Wahabees, and are called Joasimee; but God preserve us from then, for they are monsters. Their occupation is piracy, and their delight murderj and to make it worse they give you the most pious reasons for every villainy thej'- commit. They abide by the letter of tho sacred volume, rejecting all commentaries and traditions. If jrou are their captive, and you offer all you possess to save your life, they say, ‘NoJ it is written in the Koran that it is unlawful to plunder tho living, but we are not prohibited in that sacred work from stripping the dead 1 ) so saying they knock you on the head. But then, that is not so much their fault, for they are descended from a Houl, or monster, and act according to their nature. ’ But they had their virtues, as we read elsewhere, ’The most undaunted braverv was certainly theirs. If taken, they submitted with resignation to the fate they inflicted on others; and when they fell into the hands of thd Persians, or any nations by which thej*' were surrounded they were never spared. After the destruction of one of their forts, several of then -were brought on board one of our ships as priscoora^ While uncertain of their fate, and before their wounds were dressed, it was asked what treatment thejr anticipated. ’The same immediate death as we should have inflicted on you, had your fortune been ours’, was the stern and characteristic ' reply. 1 At first, while they plundered * all local vessels indiscriminately, they were careful to respect all foreign shipping, and British captains had the strictest orders never to provoke them in any way; but, in 1797, a British ship was forcibly detained by them for two days, When no retaliation was forthcoming thejr grew bolder, and another British ship (from whom thejr had. previously borrowed the powder and shot necessary) was attacked. The British put up with this sort of•-25- c thing until 1806 when the pirate fleet was blodcaded at Qisbrn and forced to sue for peace. The Jowasinis promised to restore captured vessels and * to respect the-^.ag and property of the Honourable East India Company and their subjects’; but thc^ lesson was not sharp enough and the attacks soon began again, and spread from the west coast of India to the Red Sea. A typical case was that of the iinerva, which, after a running fight of two days, was carried by boarding. 1 The coniiander, with full knowledge of the cruel fate which awaited him, attempted to blow his vessel up, but unfortunately foiled, and the slaughter of the victims commenced. The ship was first ’purified 1 with water and perfumes, and, this • accomplished, the different individuals were bound and brought forward singly to the gangway, where one of the pirates cut their throats, in the name of God.’ The Pirate fleet had by now grown to nearly a thousand ships manned by over nineteen thousand men, and the East India Company decided to take active measures against them, /in e;p&gt;edition accordingly sailed in 1909 which captured and burnt Ros ul Kliaimah 'with the pirate vessels in the port, Lingeh was treated in ohe same way, but the lesson was soon forgotten and piracy broke out again ten years later, x\nother expedition was sent which did the Job more thoroughly, uhe pirate chiefs signed a General Treaty of Peace in 1820 which,incidentally, included an anti-slavery clause. This treaty,however, while outlawing piracy, did not prohibit inter-tribal warfare at sea which, in practice, v/as almost the same thing, and in 1835 the chiefs were persuaded to sign a six-month maritime truce prohibiting all hostilities by sea. This enabled them to carry on their pearl-diving without interruption and proved such a boon to all of them that uhey readily agreed to renew it annually until 1843, then for ten years, and finally, in 1853, for ever. Since then the Pirate Coast has been known as the Trucial Coast, and the truce has remained substantially unbroken. -The keynote of British relations with the Trucial Shaikhs was then, and still is to-day, ’You may do what you like on dry land, but you may not fight or rob on the sea’. Since then Sharjah and Dubai have become refuelling points on the air-route to India, various other Shaikhs have agreed to allow emergency landing— grounds &lt;., j oe constructed and used in their territories, and the G-overnment of India have provided a Post Office and dispensary in Dubai, dost of the Shaikhs have agreed /toto allow Petroleum Concessions Limited to prospect for oil in their territories, but it is as well to remember that the presence .of foreigners in their countiy is a noveltjr to which the local people must take time to become accustomed, anr ^ wo should take every care to make our impact on them as gentle as possible* The Shaikhs are independent Arab rulers in special treaty relations with the British Government, and -they aro jealous of their independence, British and other foreign-interests are looked after by a Political Officer at Sharjah, subordinate to the Political Agent, Bahrain, and, in his absence, by on Arab official known as the Residency Age^t, ^ ^^®Th^state of iiuscat lies, strictly' specJcing, outside the Persian CujJ ^t ut ^ presents many points of similarity to the other Arab States and comes \m rl 'jr 0 f the Political Resident, It is the largest in population (p00,000) and in area, consisting of the mountainous promontory at the head of the hub and am peninsula and the coastal strip from Murair, 50 miles to the south east, right round the comer to Dhofar (capital Salalah) half way along the southern coast of Arabia. It is ruled by His Highness Sir Said bin Taimur sultan of Muscat and Oman, Oman is the name applied to the mountainous interior, whion ewes allegiance to a religious leader known as the Imam of Oman, who, although uno i} both come of the same family, is in practice independent of the Sultan and has been at war with him in the past. The Imam has no relations with foreign powers, but the Sultan has commercial treaties with the U.S.A,, Prance, and Holland, as well as with Great Britain, The people of Muscat have had trade connections with Bast , Africa for centuries, and the Sultan of Muscat was also Sultan of Zanzibar until I 856 , The two Sultanates were finally separated in 1861 under the rule of two brothers, after Great Britain had. mediated in their quarrel.

The less said about their climate the better, but it is important to behaviour! 1 Keither Christianity nor Judaism had made appreciable headway a,nong them. Then appeared and called the people to the worship of the One, the only God, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob - and of Josus. After early vicissitudes the new religion made remarkable headway, and carried their faith to India and i.Ialaya in the East, Korocco and Spain in the West, the Balkans and Central Asia in the Worth, and to iArica in the South. And for all these countries the Qoran, the Muslim scriptures, provided a code of law and behaviour usually preferable to any they had had before. The central pillar of Islam is that there is only one God, and the making of pictures and images of men or boasts is therefore forbidden lest ignorant men should be led astray into worshipping them. For this reason mosques are simple and austere, decorated only by texts iron the Qoran. Muslims must pray five times a day, and must wash their faces, hands and their feet before prayer; they arc forbidden to drink v/ine or to eat the flesh of pigs. For one month in the year. (Ramadan) they may not eat, drink, or smoko between sunrise and sunsot. They may have four wives, but only the very rich can afford to have more •than one. many ritual duties laid upon them. They hold that Jesus Christ and the Old Testament prophets were t true prophets, but that ■wnmh^' —coming after them, modified^many of choir •;v-iQrmri -i &lt;a -rhr&gt;vi^pQr g to oe followed Yihorc there is disagreement. uoa •cna’c we worsnxp, c.ud that they are very serious about it. Never interrupt them or pass near them. There is a tacit understanding in .erab countries that Christians hold to their own religion and respect that of the Muslims and vice versa . Arabs are sensitive about their religion and are quick to resent any real or imagined slight, so one must be careful not to give offence and, unless one is on very intimate toms, it is safest not to discuss religion pC*r in a few years*welded the Arab tribes into one inspired whole. Their armies praying, -'rkftt-they are worshipping the sameClosely bound up vdth religion is the question oi wonon. 'ihe Qoran enjoins that v;oaen should conceal their faces froa all &gt;-ien except their husbands and near relations, and this injunction is strictly followed by the -rabs. #tn Persia, however, the unveiling of women was ordered by the late Shah as part ox his campaign to westernise the country, and the more well-to-do Persian women have adopted western dress). In some eastern countries the local women mix freely with European men, but this is emphatically not the case in .irabia, and even a glance or a word may be a serious matter. The Arabs are very jealous 01 the honour of '-heir women and are quick 'to shed blood in defence of them, so tnat- a man who has relations with a woman who is not his wife is often killed by her husband or brother, for a Christian to have dealings with a Muslim woman is the surest way of starting trouble - and serious trouble - for the affair is looked upon as an insult from one race to another and from one religion to another. Finally, the only Muslin women who would accommodate a Christian would be xhe lowest type of prostitutes, and these are riddled with all known vanetes of venereal disease. when loeting Mrabs remember that they are generally much more leisurely than we are, so take your time when discussing business with them, besides being unhurried you should be quiet and dignified - boisterousness is considered very bad manners. Usually, in an krab assembly, the scats furthest from the door are for the exalted and those nearest the door for the lowly of station.

In Persia the Kran (180 Krans=£l) is the unit of currency, hut the Tenon (=10 Krans) is usually used in computing large suns. The Kran ^ K is divided into 100 Dinars . There is no coin of the value of one hr-on , the largest being worth 50 Dinars and called a nin Kran. Other coins are the ShrOfr-i of five Dinars and the Sannar of ten Dinars . There o.re notes for 5,10,20,100, etc,, Krons . In the Arab States Indian currency is used. The unit is the Rupee (13 1/2 Rupees = £l) and it is divided into 16 Annas. One Rupee equals Is 6d and three Rupees are equal to one Dollar. There are coins for 1,2,if, ond 8 annas, as well as for Pies (12 to one iinna) and Pice (4 to an iinna). Notes are for two, five, ten, fifty, one hundred Rupees, and upwards In Saudi Arabia the currency unit is the silver Dollar worth about Is 2d,DRAFT LETTER The Director of Naval Intelligence, Admiralty, Sir, Sxt.^755/44 ''Pa.

'Tou will find it difficult to understand where one country ends and the next begins and who runs which* Host of all you will find the manners, customs, and way cf 5 * living odd and incomprehensible. But these people are men of'like passions with ourselves, and there is much in their ways which you admire \f you knew them better. The places you see, although hot, barren, and quite unlike home, are full of interest if you look at them with understanding. The countries bordering the Persian Gulf have a great and growing international importance; and, in travelling to these countries, j^ou have an opportunity which many people who must stay at home would envy, but to make the most of this opportunity you must know something of what goes on around you. Such knowledge will enable you to avoid giving offence and, perhaps, making a fool of yourself. In many places the people have seen so few British and Americans that they judge our entire nations by the behaviour of the few they meet. Always remember that you are, in this sense, an ambassador of your country. ^ D on * t start with the idea that the Persian Gulf is Persian; it isn f t. More than half its shore-line belongs to various Arab States and less than half to Persia; and the Gulf itself, although the strait joining it to the Indian Ocean is onty twenty-nine miles wide, is a part of the high seas and therefore free for all beyond the limits of territorial waters. We who go there earn our living either on the Persian shore or in one of the Arab States, but we talk about being*posted to the Persian Gulf and * serving in the Persian Gulf 1 rather as if we were fish; and this perhaps reflects the essentially maritime natufe of our connection with the GiALf, In the past we regarded its waters as a highway for our ships, and to-da3 r regard its air as a. highway for our pianos: its shores we have always regarded, and still regard, as the property of those who live on them* During the two centuries when Britain has been the paramount Western power in these waters she has committed no conquests. Not only is the Persian Gulf a highway between East and West aria the ixano door to Persia, Iraq, and the States of North Eastern. Arabia, but i*. is an important racial and political frontier. On one side of it are the Persians, untho other the Arabs - different ■m-ouM'. spealcing different languages,with different ideals and ways of life; and they belong to different religious sects. It is essential for one who has to live and mix with them to have some idea of these differences,, and we shall return to the subject later, , Finally the Persian Gulf is important as the site of oil-fields present and future. Up to date the volume of oil from the Gulf area is small in camparison with American or Hussion output, but oil-fields are not inexhaustible end the time may come when the emptying of fields elsewhere may give the oil of the Persian Gulf a greatly increased significance. Properly to understand the present set-up it is necessary to know a little of the history of the Gulf, and this you will find in the next chapter. The first Europeans 4o be seen in force in tho Persian Gulf were Greeks, •Three hundred years before Christ that remarkable man Alexander the Great marched an army of Macedonians and- Greeks to the conquest of India, but, finding the country larger and hotter than they liked, they decided to come home bjr way of ..he Gulf, Alexander, with part of the army, marched from near iCajrachi through South Persia to the Basra area, while another detachment, under his admiral Nearchus, sailed with the heavy equipment in 1,800 small and unsafe ships along the North shore of the Gulf, The journey took them from early November 326 B, C. to late February 325 B,U, and from what has been recorded of their experiences it may be inferred that none of them were keen to repeat it. Nevertheless Alexander sent expeditions to explore the lowth shore of the Gulf and had ordered Nearchus to try to sail round Arabia to Suez when he died in 323 B.C. before ever he reached home. The next on the scene were the Portuguese and it was apparently pepper uhat brought them. Our European ancestors of the Middle Ages seem to have had a raie fondness for pepper and other spices from the East, and for these they were prepared'to pay well. Persia, India, and China also produced finely manufactured goods, silks, and brocades, the demand for which was possibly created by oui ancestors* wives: the demand was certainly furious. These things had to find /theirtheir way to the Mediterranean overland, through the Persian Gulf, or through the Red Sea, and the cost of transporting then was so high that it was soon realised that a fortune awaited anyone who could operate an ,all-sea route to India* The Portuguese were the first on to it, and Vasco da Gama* s voyage round the Cape of Good Hope fCb,- ; i ; . ■ . to litdia in 1498 was one of the most significant events in all tho history of ivhe East. The Portuguese then planned to send their ships to India to fetch the merchandise and to stop the trade up the Persian Gulf and the Red sea which was, at the tine, being profitably carried on by Arab merchants. The first thing the inoffensive Arab merchants knew was the arrival of the Portuguese Admiral Affonso de Albuquerque, at the head of a squadron of siw warships, at Ras ul Hadd, the /asternmost corner of Arabia. It is difficult to improve on the oldest account of his proceedings there, *And they found there ,..30 or 40 fishing ships, which were come thither from the city of Ormuz, Calayate, and all that coast to fish... and they burned all these ships, and on the following mornin'g set sail with a fair wind, and took the ships f boats with masts and sails*, At Quryat, farther up ihe coast, *He was ill received, and storming the town, net with a vigorous opposition, but entered with the death of 80 of the enemy and loss of three Portugueseaj after the plunder the place was burnt and with it 14 vessels that were in the harbour. Hence he sailed eight leagues further to Mascate...« So it went on: and we should remember that this was the Arabs first introduction to Christian Europeans. Finally de Albuquerque captured Hormuz which must then have been very different from the unimpressive ruins which may still be seen on the island of that name near Bandar Abbas. According to writers of the tira it was, 'as bigge as Exeter, the % buildings faire and spacious... 1 andi'doing more trade in its best days than London and Amsterdam combined'; and. Milton wrote of 'The wealth of Ormuz and of Ind’. During nearly a hundred years while they had things much their own way, except for some Turkish opposition fren the direction oi Iraq., the Portuguese Luilu forts along the Batina coast, at Muscat, Hormuz, and Bahrain, dominating completely the trade and politics .of the Persian Gulf, while the Pope confirmed their king in hia title of 'Lord of the Conquest, Navigation and Commerce of India, Ethiopia, Arabia, and Persia.' Possibly it was too much accent on the Conquest and not enough on the Commerce which made tha prosperity of Hormuz decline under their managementand, nore serious, brought upon thorn the disapproval of one of the greatest non who ever led Persia - Shah Abbas. In 1602 he drove then from Bahrain and in 1620 from a position they occupied near Ras ul Xhaimah on the Trucial Coastj while in the years between he established a new port, which he named Bandar .^ebas after himself, as a rival to Homuz 0 During the sane years various enterprising U Englishmen took advantage of the security prevailing throughout Persia under Shah Abbas to visit his Court, and the King of Spain (who had sub ji^gated Portugal in 1580) sent a succession of priests to represent hin* Shah Abbas, however, did not hold with priests and wrote to the king that *Ho was weary of receiving Friers as Ambassadors’ and asking to be sent ^some Spanish Gentleman of Koto* instead ’for he should know better how to treat with such a one, and God and His Majesty would be better served, because a religious man out of his cell was like a fish out of water’* ihe uhah got his Spanish Gentlemen of Note, who peremptorily demanded the restitution of certain places lately conquered by the Persians and the exclusion of the English and all other Europeans from the Persian trade, ’This was too much for the Shah who tore up the letters and swore that, so far from restoring what he had already taken, he would rive the Portuguese from their fortress at Hormuz; while he ordered a Farman to be made out granting the sole trade in silks by the sea route to the English'. The Shah kept his word, but, since then, hundreds of Europeans have repeated the Spaniard's mistake. Never try, like the Spanish Gentleman of Note, to be high-handed with the Persians^ Rather typically it was a large consignment of unsaleable broadcloth that first brought the British to Persia, but to make the matter clear it is necessary t.o go back a little. The defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 made the English realise that there was no reason to continue letting the Spanish and Portuguese monopolise such a good thing as the Eastern trade, and in the year 1600 Queen Elizabeth was pleased to grant a charter to ’The Governor and Company of the Merchants of London trading into the East Indies’, who proceeded to establish a trading-post or 'factory' at Surat on the West coast of India. Their object was 'by fair means to obtain a quiet and peaceable trade’ but the Portuguese saw fit to interfere and had to be defeated in two sea-battles off Surat in 1612 and 1615. And so we get back to our broadcloth, which was then England’s chief article of export. The Company were at their wits’ end to know how to dispose of a large consignment of it which had /arrivedarrived at Surat, or cl which the Indians (and you can hardly blame them considering the climate) showed no eagerness to buy. They thought they saw light when they heard from a traveller that in Persia they might be assured ’of the vente of much clotjo, in regard their country is much cold, rnd men, women, and children are clothed therewith some five months of the year 1 , and they established their first factory in Persia at Jask with others at Shiraz and Isfahan, The Portuguese fleet, of course, interfered again and wej3 defeated in a* hot battle off Jask ii In 1622 the British did an odd thing. The Persians, who were besieging Hormuz much needed help from the sea, demanded-with threats and promises the assistance of a British fleet which happened to be nearby. Although England and Spain were at peace^ the Company agreed^ and the fleet joined forces with the Persians to drive out the unfortunate Portuguese. The Persians took the lion’s share of the loot and practically demolished Hormuz which never again raised its head; but Pox-’tuguese power in the Gulf was broken and the English opened a factory at Bandar Abo as which remained the centre of their activities in the Gulf for 1^0 years. There was one relieving feature of the incident, of a nature unusual at that time, Ir the words of a Portuguese historian, ’The English Captains have performed their premise made upon yield-up of the Castle, by giving two of their own ships or pinasses to carry away all the people whither they would goe, also by defending then that at no tine neither Moore nor Infidell should do them any hurt:... and more, they have given hospitality to our sick and wounded, which are neere about two hundred at the least, whom they have sustained and cured with as great care and diligence as if they had baene their own brothers’ The British, however, were far from being out of the wood: during tho succeeding years they had to compete with the far more formidable rivalry of the Dutch East India Company which had also established itself at Bandar Abbas. The Dutch proved astute and unscrupulous traders, and, as their company was run as a State enterprise with the whole-hearted backing of the government, they soon drew ahead of the English company which was a private undertaking with lukewarm government support. The conduct of the Persians was exasperating to both Dutch and English, and the 1620 , with a land army (Shah Abbas was keeping his word to the Spanish ambassador) and /Dutchm Dutch in 1650 used force to coerce then* This, though it tenporaril^’’ incie^-s their ascendancy, redounded to their disadvantage in the long run, j-oi the Peisians did not forgot it. The position of the English company was strengthened ^oout X100 by the omolgonation with it of various competing companies and by more dotornanod government support, and nith the turn of the century came the turning-point in their fortunes. This was signalised in a typically Oriental manner - the Shoh of r^rsia decided to honour the British factory at Isfahan with a State visit. 'i«r.3rucc, the Conapny's agent and all the factory, great and snail, were ordered to leave their house, and chamber doors and warehouses all open, for His Majesty and his Seraglio ccapanicns to ramble thro', and take such things as best pleased non and his minions; and there was a table left in the Dining Room spread with the richest sweetmeats and fruit. I believe the Company was not very ambitious of having such honours conferred on them, since tto were obliged to pay for W. £12,000 the bill came to, but, the Dutch tried their best to secure a similar honour from the Shah, and failed. The Shah's goodwill proved well worth the money and British fortunes forged ahead, but unfortunately it was not long before Persia entered on a period of anarchy, so that the trade declined and, for nearly a hundred lean years it seemed hardly worth while hanging on. The French, too, established themselves at Bandar Abbas, and, although ddo;;- never proved dangerous rivals in trade, they caused serious inconvenience during the periodic wars of the 18th century. The Bandar Abbas factory was closed down in 1?63 and another opened at Bushire, virile, for a few years in tire interval, Basra was the centre of British commercial activity. About this tine the competition of the Dutch finally faded out as they tended to concentrate their attention more on their • Far Eastern possessions, and, since then, the British, rath their headquarters at Bushiro, have remained the paramount power in the Persian dulf. The ,tory of what they have done and have not done, during these hmrdred and eighty years when they have had the povrer to do anything they wished must form another chapter. Ill* *THE MOST UNSELFISH PAGE HI HISTORY* in 1763, when Britain found herself alone in the field of ca.mercial ca^etition the Gulf was in a state of chaos, ^charted and unbuoyed, and infested by pirates and the roving war-fleets of Arab potentatos. For many years relations betvraen-7- (ho: Persia and the Arabs had beer governed by, *The ancient law, the simple plan, That he shall talce who hath the power, ^ And he shall keep who can', and, roughly between the years sixteen and seventeen hundred, the Persians had done the* taking* At various times they had occupied nearly all the Arab coast from Basra to Mas cat /but^ as disorders in Persia increased^ their hold on these places slipped, and, from about 1700, the ^‘jaabs controlled the entire south shore and dominated parts of the Persian coast, notably the Lingeh comer. It was therefore the Arabs, and prominent amongst them the Wajj&amp;bi^, who provided the British authorities with most of their problems, and the first problem was piracy, t ^ sW** cJi The Waimbi^ were the followers of a -puritan reformer named Mwlmu.iod -ibr Abdul - Wal^ab who set out to clean up Islaj.i* They were Bedouin of central Arabia, tough, savage, fanatical, and recklessly brave, and their hand was turned as much against other Muslins who disagreed with their ideas as against Christians* They captured the port of Qatif in 1800 and their hold soon spread to the whole Arab shore of the Gulf, whose inhabitants found it convenient to conform to their tenets - particularly the principle of plundering persons of other religious views. This naturally gave a fillip to piracy, for which the men of the Persian Gulf in general and of the i Pirate Coast (new Trucial Coast) in particular had long been notorious, so that no ship of any nationality, unless heavily armed or convoyed, was safe anywhere between India and Africa. The story of the pirates will be told in the section on - the Trucial Coast but here it is just necessary to mention that the East India Company sent an expedition against them in 1809, and a little later a Turko-*Egyptian axmy under Mohamad -Ali Pasha, an /Albanian soldier who had risen to become Viceroy of Egypt under the Turks and from whom the present King of Egypt is descended, advanced against the Walfebi^ from the West* /Although the Wahabis were commanded by their great leader, the Amir Sa*ud, ancestor of the present King of Saudi Arabia, the Egyptians over-ran their country and reached the Persian Gulf at Hasa in 1818* By this time the British, who had been too lenient with the pirates after their first expedition, found themselves compelled to send another, and they deputed one of their officers, an Irish captain called Sadleir, to secure the co— operation oa. the Egyptians* When Sadleir reached Hasa he discovered that the Egyptians, who found /Arabia■ ) f - 8 - - * Arabia too largo, turbulort, a^d barrer to hold, had already begur to vdthdr^, wostwards, but his orders wore to ooutact the*, so ho followed. The ii.rthor ho the further they retreated until, after untold diffioulties and dangers, ho c^e out on the Shores of the Red Sea, his horse dying under him just as he irrivod. crossing of Arabia, alone and at that date, is a feat of courage and endur^cewhich deserves to be remembered. The expedition (undertaken, of course, &gt;athout, an, hcl fron the Egyptians) was successful, and a general Treaty of Peace was signed in 1820 by which the Arabs bound themselves to abends pira^ -against any nation whatsoever-. Britain thus won security for the ships of all nations trading to the Persian Gulf. In the succeeding years British officials applied themselves to eliminating the perpetual soa-warfaru prevailing between the Arab tribes, and a Treaty of Peace in Perpetuity was si^ed in 1853. provided for the cessation of all war-like acts at sea, victims of aggression being required not to retaliate but to p matter to the British authorities, and was an immense boon to all oonc^reed. •what the Arabs did to each other on lard Britain did not cancom no peace at sea has continued unbroken to this day, „ , qvxo Vinrl h^nsolf taken a loading part Britain’s next problem was the Slave trade, lo „ one ti- « «» •&gt;» « ^ ’' M '‘ -as early as 1772.

Only those who are bom of slave parents and who choose of thoir own free will to stay on in their master*s house need remain slaves, but this is a large number* Arab masters would, often gladly be rid of the idle slaves whom tradition compels them to support; and domestic slavery has almo^'. entirely ceased in Kuwait- Bahrain, and Muscat, Elsewhere it frequently happens that a slave who, after a tiff with his master, has cane to the Political Agent and demanded his freedom, spends a few weeks earning his living as a free man in a world of free competition and then, returning to his master, begs to. oe taken back into the comfort and security of slavery. Further to interfere for the sake of appearances with this old and not inhumane institution, sanctioned b 3 ^ religion and bound up, as it is, with social and economic needs, would only arouse anti- foreign feeling while doing doubtful good to the slaves themselves* No account of the suppression of slavery in these waters would be complete which did not mention the untiring and selfless eforts of the men of the Royal Navy and the Indian Navy who, for scores of years, under terrible climatic and living conditions, maintained the ceaseless patrol which did more than any treaty in making all efforts to ship slaves simply not worth while. During the nineteenth centuiy a cable and (later) wireless system through the Gulf was established linking India with Europe and providing inter-comrnunicaoion between the Persian and Arab coastal ports. At the same time the Gulf ..as accurately surveyed by personnel of the Royal and Indian Navies and a series of charts prepared which have since proved an inestimable boon to the shipping of all nations* same may be said for the establishment of lighthouses and the ' ; LJLc'J- placing of buoys wherever required^ A fU puf&amp;i ~ Public health was also a primary concern of the British Authorities, and, statistical and meteorological information was collected. Quarantine arrangements were made at all the larger ports so that the incidence of plague was much diminished and the scourge of cholera banished from the Persian Gulf. The Island of Xharag (north-west of Bushire) was occupied in 18. -1&amp; ‘Ogftxn in iS^-lQilin the course of hostilities which broke out between Great Britain and Persia 'during which the British also took Bushiro and Khurroj'nshahr (then called Muhammerah) and sent an army as far as Ahwaz. At this time the 'furies, who controlled Iraq, also claimed a shadowy suzerainty over Kuwait, Has a, and Q*tor. /Lord- 10 - Lord Curzon summed up Britain^ position, at that time in a speech to the Trucial Chiefs in 1903, f Some times I think that the i-’ecord of the past is in danger of being forgotten ••• We saved you from extinction at the hands of your neighbours.

We have not destroyed your indopend.encto, but have preserved it. We are not now going to throw away this century of costly and triumphant enterprise; we sha.ll not wipe out the most unselfish page in history,,,The peace of these waters must still be maintained; your independence will continue to bo upheld; and the influence of the British Government must remain supreme, 1 Although this may read a trifle boiibastically now, and we should be inclined to a modification, or at least ( to a less forthright expression, of these opinions, the position then was different* What amounted to an international rush for the Persian Gulf was in pro gress, ’The French, whose status in Huscat was nominally identical with that of Great Britain, desired to secure a coaling station there in 1895; Russia, in the endeavour to enlarge her sphere of influence, sent Various missions thither, ostensibly to establish a ’warm water port’ to serve as a constant outlet for her trade, and heavily -subsidised a line of steamers from the. Black Sea; Purkoy assumed control of «I35Wstates on the western littoral, claiming suzerainty over Has a and. Bahrain and oven Oman, and endeavouring to bring within her orbit the long-autonomous principality of Kuwait; while Germany, in pursuance of her Oriental policy and the realization of her dream of a through route from Hamburg to the Persian Gulf, spared no pains to obtain a solid footing under the guise of commercial expansion,,,’ There was, at the time, a flourishing trade in modem rifles from Hus cat across the Gulf to t?outh Persia, whence they reached warlike Afghan tribes who used then to disturb the peace of British India, and most of Persia and Arabia, was aimed frbn the same source, Hany of these arms arrived in French ships, and the protection of the French flag v/as used, too,||j bj* - many of the flfrhows engaged in the Slave Trade, All these causes of friction \.Qx\- ^ eradicated by the establishment of the Entente Oordiale with France, and rivalry with Russia abated after the signing of the Anglo-#ussian convention of 190? which constituted the Persian Gulf a British sphere of influence. In 191A a British army passed through the Persian Gulf to Iraq where it fought a prolonged and arduous campaign resulting in the liberation of that country from Turkish domination and its establishment as an independent Arab state, Host of(az.) V - 11 - East Persia was occupied too as a preliminary to the formation of a cordon to prevent German agents infiltrating from Turkey into Afghanistan with the object of instigating that country to attack India# This gave the Germans an opportunetj^ of paying on Persian patriotism, and their agent Wassmuss succeeded, in raising the Qashgai tribe in the hinterland of Bushire and in diverting the best part of a division of British troops, an exploit which other of their argents have endeavoured to emulate in this war. It is now time to turn to the Persian Gulf as it is to-day, and to keep the distinction clear, we will deal with Persia and the Arab States separately, but, before doing so it would perhaps be as well to explain the system of Political control which has been evolved. The chief representative of British interests is the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, whose headquarters are at Bushire. V^a^vis the Persians he is Consul-General for Bushire and the Persian ports in the Gulf. There- are also Consuls at Khurramshahr, Bushire, and Bandar Abbas, vath a British Consular Agent at lingeh# On the Arab side he controls Political Agents at‘ Kuwait, Bahrain, and Kuscat, and, subordinate to the Political Agent at Bahrain, a Political Officer on the Trucial Coast# These Political Agents are nothing to do vath elections. They arc the representatives of the British and Indian Governments in the temton.es to which they are posted, and discharge the functions of Consuls besides doing many things which an ordinary Consul does not have to do. As it is obviously not dosixobl that Europeans and Americans should have to submit to Arab courts and Qoranic law, all foreigners are subject to the civil and criminal ^Isdiction of the Political Agent. Joint Courts consisting of the Political Agent and the Sheikh, or, for rain or cases, of the Assistant Political Agent and one of the Sheikh &lt; s relations, are held to try cases in which foyers and the Sheikh's subjects are both involved. As the sole representative, not only of Britain, but ci all xoreigp countries, the Political Agent naturally can and does influence and guiuo uho Sheikh in many matters lying beyond the scope of treaties# Members of the Allied forces should only have dealings with the local authorities through the Political Agent who is best able to ensure that the maxima of co-operation is secured from the Arabs while their rights and susceptibilities are respected by the allies, (or, with the frills off, to see that the Arabs play ball and we don t oread /toes- 12 - toes nore than v/e have to)* Apart fron oil, the foreign trade of the Gulf is mostly vdth Aaabay, and the great majority of British Subjects living in the G-ulf are Indians* For those, as well as for historical reasons, the Political Officers are members of the Indian political. Sexance, appointed frora India, and the policy they follow is the joint product of the Government of India aoG the Foreign office. The fact that some have military rank while others do not merely shows that thejr entered the Service from the Army and not from the^Civil Service. The rank signifies little - plain hr* may be more important than major, here as elsewhere. IV. THE PERSIAN SHORE. Persia has a glorious past* Maybe she has a glorious future too, but you will j&gt;oS5'ibXi4 panefeably find in her present nuioh that you want to criticise. Don’t: the Persians will never forgive you. They are very sensitive about the imperfections of present- day Persia which most of them realise just as well as you; and the ones that don’t realise are not worth telling. The Persians / 'are atf' Aryan race^and^speak an Aryan language. This means that their language is similar to European languages and not to Arabic and Turkish, and that they possibly come of the same race as European nations. Although since then ever-run by Mongols, Tartars, Turks, Arabs, and Afghans, the Persians have never been submerged: they have kept their language, traditions, and culture alive and have always absorbed their conquerors. Their language is a good one and has progressed linguistically much further than many European languages, butin the middle ages Persia adopted the Arabic writing and with it, many .arabic words. This has made Persian much nore difficult for us to learn and understand, uuu j 1} j..,. still worth learning. It has a store of poetry of a high order, and some of the ancient Persian poets have been translated into many of the languages of Europe, The Persians are proud of their origin and justly proud of their language and literature, ryr 'Feui^hundred years before Christ the warrior-king Darius, Lord of the ’Medes and Persians’ of Bible fame, led Persian armies through much of what later became South Russia and Rumania and attacked Greece, &gt; The King with half the East at heel is marcheo from lands of morning, ’His fighters drink the river up, their shafts oenight the air, •And he that stands will die for nought and home there’s no returning’, /andw 12$) and so forth* Darius also led his armies to Palestine, Syria, and Egypt* Eor uu'ch of her history Persia ruled Iraq, the Caucasus, and parts of central Asi*a« The Persian king Nadir Shah conquered Afghanistan, and North India and reached Delhi, where he held a massacre of the civil population which is remembered to this day - almost A ' exactly three hundred years after * The Persians are proud of their’ past military glories* There are also innumerable small things of which P jrsians are proud, such as their calendar, which is, in point of fact, more scientific and convenient than our own* I have now told you three times that Persians are proud, and it is the first point to remember when dealing with them* They are also very polite, and, although such punctiliousness may appear to us somewhat ludicrous, It is best when meeting or speaking with them to use your most ceremonies manner. But they have their points* They are a witty, cheerful, friendly people much addicted to gardens, flowers, and picnics, aid are quick to respond to appreciation of these things in others* modem Persians hate to be thought oriental, roi uhe last twenty years they have been striving mightily to westernise and industrialise their country - an uphill task in which they have made great strides* They like foreigners to notice how much more western Persia is than most of her neighbours* There is a delicate point that should be touched on in preparing you for the Persians. In the days of Darius, we read, Persian youths were taught ride, shoot, and speak the truth*. These three subjects are noticably absent from the curricula cf modem Persian schools, and it is necessary to discount much of what you hear from Persians, and to make ample allowance for exaggeration. It may be that to tell the truth, they feel, would often be impolite or unpleasant, or, possibly, that Persians prize the truth as too valuable a commodity to be recklessly squandered on comparative strangers* Another Persian foible we should tales account of is - let us face it - their inordinate affection for the Gomans. There are perfectly clear reasons for this and it is as well to understand then. There are two European nations of which the Persians feel that they have seen decidedly more than they want to - the Russians and the English. Advancing on Pemia from two different directions they have hcamed her in during the last two hundred years and have both occupied territories which She considers her legitdxaate Ichensr^ and Persia has begun to suffer fra* claustrophobia. The eltoa* was reached- in' 1907 *en. a convention was si^od herebyNorth Persia was agreed to be a Russian, South East Persia a British, and the Gulf shore West of Bandar Abbas a neutral sphere of influence (ci$th$r ocuntry, of course, wanted any part of Persia, but each feared that, if she kept out the other would walk in. Now things have been more satisfactorily arranged by both countries agreeing p to keep out after the war,) At that time units of the British and Russian armies were on Persian soil in the guise of Consular Escorts', and all this ms a bitter blow to Persian pride* Then Germany appeared, a knight in shining armour, and, while from her distance herself presenting no threat to Persia, proceeded to &lt; attack both Britain and Russia* It seemed that Germanjr was fighting Persia's battles# Add to this thirty years of clever and insidious German propaganda, and the fact that Persians have seen only very few Germans and then never as enemies, and that Persia and Germany did much trade together in the years before this war, and you have the basis of the Persians 1 peculiar predilection# We shall never cure the Persians by patronising them or bullying them, but we may one day win them over by sympathy and friendliness* What I have said hitherto applies chiefly to oducated Persians and the official class, but the Persian although he may not be so enthusiastic about westernisation, has roughly the some idea^ in a uedxflod. form* He is a likeable fellow, wp4*&lt; hardy and industrious, and very much dywi j iu ui 1 OfUlb 1 1 « On the whole one docs not see the best type of either on the Persian Gulf littoral{ the villagers are, if anyohing, poorer and more down-trodden than elsewhere, and Persian officials regard service in the Gulf as a penance and do their utmost to avoid it, Persia is the largest country abutting on the Gulf ** six times as big as Prance in area, and with a population of about 15,000,000 - considerably more than Canada. Before the war she had a Navy consisting of four modem, fast, sloops. Her garrisons stationed in the main towns were the largest and best equipped on the Gulf, and she had an Mr Porco. She had a strong and determined Shah who, riding on the wave of nationalism which was the natural result of the indignities Persia had suffered in the last war, set about seeing that Persia was mistress in her own house,' He subdued rebellious tribes throughout the country and reasserted Persian claims to the islands and opposite shore of the Persian Gulf* Persian customs officials excelled them selves in devising means of obstruction and petty annoyances^ and the British, sowing i Hen jam and before the storm, abandoned thei] /Qishm rlQishn ^Tfrioh-^hey hnd' 'rtstyd—as ■ooa.ling stTrfaians-, Sirnilar difficulties were net when it was proposed to establish an air-route to India along the Persian shore of the Gulf,^ and it bocone clear that the Persians did not desire the route to be administered by foreigners while not wishing to incur the responsibility and esepense ol administering it themselves* Further, they demanded that the route should pass through Tehran* This was not considered practicable and the air—line was thereiore organised to pass along the Arab shore, to which Britain has never admitted Persian claims. But, for the Persian Gulf, the most momentous innovation was the construction of the trans-Persian railway from Bandar Shahpur, on the Gulf, to Bandar Shah on the Caspian* During the whole of the nineteenth century the main route into the interior had been from Bushire to Shiraz, and, in consequence, the port of Bushiro had flourished at the expense of Bandar Abbas. During the last twenty years it has been the turn of Bu^hire to decline at W* pyppn&amp;e. of Bandar Shahpur, which has a much better harbour, and the trade of Persia has been concentrated at the head of the Gulf, In addition burdensome customs regulations and the corruption and rapacity of Persian officials far from the control of Tehran have made the lot of traders in the Gulf ports of Persia a most unhappy one, and the ports themselves present a dismal picture of depression and decay. Many of the merchants and thousands of shopkeepers, artisans, and labourers have emigrated to. the Arab side, where freedom from iricsome restrictions and Government control make life easier, and they have taken much of the trade with them. For instance, the market for pearls (the most important export, after oil, from the Gulf) has been entirely transferred from Lingeh to Dubai and other Arab ports, which have benefitted immensely. ' Abadan presents a vivid contrast. This island, near the head of the Gulf, houses the largest oil refinery in the world. It draws its crude oil by pipe-line from the mountains of the interior and, in 1938, exported OCO/XD tens cf rrdnoa dl, or, which the Persian government received £ ,000,000 in royalties or of the net profits. The concession on which the oil industry is based was given to the British in 190 and expires in 1993. The industry is now Persia's greatest af^ter agriculture and employs 000 British and 30,000 Persian personnel, iivery effort is being made to associate Persians more and more in the work and management of the company, and they fill many of the most responsible positions. It was largely with the help of the oil royalties that Persia managed to buid her railway at a cost of £30,000,000 /withoutwithout borrowing a ponnj^ abroad, and it uafbXy bo said that the concession has ■' proved a boon to both Persia and Britain, , V. , PH3 iRaB SHORE* cka%, C**siKu&lt;*iU* V lo\a '*c*M*\ The Arabs aad -thi?

In the Dark Ages they learnt and improved upon the tu scientific knowledge of the ancient Hindus fand passed it on to Purope through their academies of learning in kuslim Spain, This knowledge was the seed from which our 5 6&lt;jLmcC modern Icnovd-^ge grew* We use in everyday English scores of Arabic words - in fact the word Britain is probably of Arabic origin* The Phoenicians, who visited Britain to buy tin, called the island Barr~ut-tanak4* which is plain Arabic for ’Land of tin 1 . Prom this name the Romans, through the Greek derived Britannicus and Britannia, whence our British and Britain. Arab ideas and Arab dress are well suited to their climate, and they have the sense to realise that, as they cannot change their climate, they would gain nothing by apeing the habits of Europe. The Arab has no inferiority complex vis^a-v ls the European. He realises, of course, that the Westerner has many material possessions that he has to do without, but he reflects that the Christian will roast in Hell for all eternity while the Muslim mil be luxuriating in Kea\an. Considering that he has the best of the bargain he feels pity for us ‘rather than envy. The Arabs never forget that all men are equal in the sight of God and this makes them as democratic any people on earth.

Indeed it was possibly this custom which caused the great split in Islam between Sunnis (in Arabia and Turkey) and Shiahs (in Persia), When the prophet Mahw-wdr*died the Arabs thought it perfectly natural to choose three of his elderly companions to succeed him in turn before choosing his son-in-law and nearest relative *Ali, The Persians with their rigid ideas of kingship and succession thought that ! Ali was the only rightful successor* Shiahs and Sunnis have been k-irLling oaoh-r-fehey ever since and the question still hasn’t been ‘ decided. , ^ A Iraq, like Persia, has seen better days. 1 It was a country of 25,000,000 people when the Mongols captured Baghdad in 1097 and destroyed the system of canals by which the country lived. It has never regained its former prosperity and now has only about 4,000,000 inhabitants. Its seabord is small but 100 miles up the Shatt al Arab river lies the port of Basra which is by far the largest in (or off) the Persian Gulf# steamers docked there in 1938, and the Basra Port Authority now maintains all the buoys and lighthouses in the Gulf. .After oil (which is taken to the Mediterranean by pipe-line) Iraq’s largest export is of dates and these are exported from Basra# In fact Iraq and the area of south-west Persia near the head of the Gulf produce together no less than ^ of the world’s supply of dates. The trade in dates, which is mostly carried in sailing boats from Kuwait, is therefore one of great importance locally. Apart from Great Britain and the U.S.i*, the following western countries maintain- consular representatives in Basra,In Arabic i'AL Ku\/ait means ’the little fort* and its people have always tried to maintain the State as a little fortress between its powerful neighbours, Iraq and Saudi Arabia* Shortly after the foundation of the town about 1750 it served as a refuge for a large part of the population of Basra when the latter ©as conquered* by the Persians in 177^&gt; and, at the same time, much of the trade of Central Arabia was diverted to Kuwait. When the Arabs won back Basra in 1779 many of the refugees stayed on in Kuwait, attracted no doubt by the superior climate and excellent harbour, and thus the foundation of the town’s prosperity was laid. To protect his country against Bedouin raids and minor foreign oncrachments the ruler, Shaikh Six' Ahmed ill Jabii* A1 Sabah k,C, I.E, C,S t I,, has six Lems guns mounted on trucks, 150 trained soldiers armed with *303 rifles, and 80 armed police, But every Arab considers himself a soldier and the town walls could probaoly be manned, by 6,000 aimed men and boys in an emergency, while larger numbers of Bedouin tribesmen would come forward for the defence of the State. But against major aggression the KifcjftVfr-Ls, rely on the protection of the British Government and on the fact that their neighbours have promised the British to respect the integrity and independence of Kuwait,^ &lt;The Shaikh comes of a branch of the Utub section of the Anaizab tribe ox Central Arabia, to which section the Shaikhs of Bahrain also belong, [it is Ids own responsib ility to rule in accordance with the wishes and best interests of his people, xor he can expect no help from abroad should they became dissatisfied with his rule and decide to turn him out. He has accordingly formed an Advisory Council of fourteen members to help him in tho government*^ In 191A again in 1939 the Shaikh placed hio 1 efforts, his men, and his ships at the disposal of the Government of Great Britain’* The state is largely desert and there is practically no agriculture, with the result that malaria is almost unknown and the inhabitants are more robust than would otherwise be the case. As a result of the winter rains 4 large area is covered with grass in the spring and early summer and the Bedouin cone in from the desert ■ uo graze their flocks on the new vegetation* Apart from the produce of these flocks nearly all food and other necessities of life have to be imported,, ^yon drinking water is brought by boat from Fao in Iraq. Kuwait exports in return little of value except pearls and lives on the profits of her shipbuilding industry, trade, and the earnings of her deep-sea sailors, Arab sailing ships known as boons (with ported sterna) /and■ i' IlC^ r -19- ajnd soinbugs (with square stems) are built there, and some 60 of those fit for long journeys and up to 300 tons burden are normally*maintained as well as several hundred smaller pearling boats. The big ships sail very fast,especially before the wind, and have been known to cover the 1200 miles between Kuwait and Karachi in five days, V^ The voyages of the Kuwait ships are interesting. They all start in the autenn when they go to Basra and load dates. These they soli in the Gulf ports, on the West coast of India, in the South Arabian ports, and on the Bast coast of .africa, where the prevailing northerly winds carry them. In the spring when the south-west monsoon brings them homo, they take back cloves and 'spices from Zanzibar, and mangrove poles for building from the Rufiji river in Tanganyika, They bring timber for boatbuilding from Malabar in Southern India, and tea, sugar, cloth, and manu factured articles from Bombay, The difficulties and dangers of these voyages have made the Kuwaitis enterprising and self-reliant sailors as well as astute traders, and for these qualities they compare favourably with any people in the Gulf, It is hoped that, in future, the chief export of Kuwait mil be oil. The Anglo- Persian and the American Gulf Oil Companies formed the Kuwait Oil Company on a fiftjf per cent basis in 1934, and the Shaikh granted the Company a concession covering the whole of his territory in 1935* Gil was struoio in 1938 and there are believed to be very large reserves. Before the war’ there were only somo hundred British and Americans in Kuwait and the industry v/as only just getting started, but it is hoped that it will, in time, bring real prosperity to the State. Going down the coast tho 300 mile stretch of low-lying desert between Kuwait and the Peninsula.* of Qatar is known as Hasa and forms a province of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia# The growths of this kingdom is a thrilling stoxy centring round the romantic * figure of King Ibn Saud# He was 4 tall, determined youth of 20 when he rode out of Kuwait in 1900 at the head of a little band of only devoted follov/ors, a penniless exile bent on retrieving the fortunes of his family# He struck straight at his enemy 1 s capital and was so successful that, after a series of desert wars lasting nearly thirty years, he built a kingdom reaching from Hasa on the Persian Gulf to A1 Hejaz on the Red Sea, and from the Great Desert on the South to the borders of Palestine and Transjordan on the North, and containing more than 5,000,000 people* He has been wounded dozens of times, has killed scores of men in battle and has wedded hundreds of women. He is new an old man and has some forty sons living, /Re- 20 - He is the greatest Arab leader since Maha^tedrf as vise in the council charifcer as he is brave on the field of battle, and has always been a staunch friend of the British# At the most critical moment of the present war, the very ebb of our fortunes, when it seemed to millions in the middle hast and elsewhere that thn Axis was bound to win, Xbn Saud made a spontaneous public declaration of support for the Allies which was of immense value in buttressing the wavering faith of the Huslim nations. He rules the Arabs by methods which they understand - and like# He has even stopped then stealing, an achievement incredible to those who knew Arabia before his advent# The Arabs tell a story of his justice that one of them came to his court and reported that he had seen two bags of grain lying in the desert ’How did you know that the bags contained grain?’, asked the king. ’I touched them with my finger#’ said the Arab, ’With which finger?' asked the King# ’With this one, ’The Arab ans , wered, holding it up# The Icing turned to his slaves, 'Cut it offi ’ he ordered 'How often have I told you Arabs not to touch other peoples’ property]' The province of Hasa is governed for Ton Saud by an Amir residing at Hofuf, an oasis inland of Bahrain Island, and most of the population (about 150,000) is centred betv/een here and the ports of Qatif and Oqair# It is here too that oil has been found and is being y/orked by the Californian Arabian Standard Oil Company, an entirely American concern operating under a concession granted by Ibn Saud to the Standard Oil Company in 1933# Oil in great quantities was struct: in 1938 in the Dhahran area and work was just getting under way at the outbreak of war. About 100 Americans live in a well-appointed air-conditioned village at Dhahran and a port is being devel oped at Has Tanura# American firms, in fact, hold oil concessions Aor. nearly all Saudi Arabia - atf area believed to contain reserves of oil much greater than those of Persia and Iraq combined. Although Ibn Saud owns no big port on the Persian Gulf his influence there is nevertheless great. Had. he not promised to maintain friendly relations with Persian Gulf statea having treaties with the British Government he would doubtless have absorbed most of them before now, and their rulers, who fully realise this, have a deep respect and admiration for Ibn Saud and treat his wishes .with deference.Thore is no Politioal Agent or other British representative in Hasa, relations vdth Ton oaud being conducted through the British Minister in Jedda on the Red Sea. Bahrain io an island thirty miles long by ten miles brood v/ith one of the worst climates in the world. It used to have a ring of decrepit fishing villages round the ^ge and just desert in the centre. Nowadays there is an oil-field, rofinezy, and air conditioned camp 1 in the centre, the villages of Manama and Muharraq have become fair« 5 izecl to\*ns with many modem amenities, and palaces have sprung up every where. b has put Bahrein on the nap. . The island of Bahrain- with its satellite islands is tuled by the M Khalifa family of the Utub tribe which invaded it from the mainland of Arabia in 1783 and conquered it. To this day they number only a few hundred families and belong to the ^unni sect whereas their predecessors, the Baharina, belong to the opposition Shiah sect and number some 50,000 - half the population of the islands* There are 15,00C Persians of both sects and 1,000 Indians of several religions, so that sectarian strife is apt to cause trouble. The islanders also have to adapt themselves to the presence of some 300 British and 100 Americans of the oil companies. The Sheilch, who is an independent ^rab ruler enjoying British protection, is Sir Salmon bin Hamad A1 Khalifa and to help him in his government he employs a British adviser is.. D. Belgrave. He also has British experts to run the Customs, Engineering, Public Health, and H/ducation departments, and a force of 350 armed police who are probably the best trained and organised in the Persian Gulf. Bahrain has gone in for education in a big way.'s**^ there eapoboys- in the oclreuis. as parents find that education increases the marriage-value of their daughters the Girls School, which owes it;s inception to che keeness and initiative of Mrs.Belgrave, is also flourishing and there are mopy more applicants than there are vacancies,Nona these amenities would exist were it not for the oil ro3' , alties ^which, before the war, averaged £ per annum*) They are divided in the proportion of a third to the Shaikh for the expenses of his Government and the support of his numerous and exacting relatives, a third to the Municipalities of Manama and Muharraq, and a third to a sinking fund against the rainy day when the oil is exhausted. Oil was discovered in Bahrain in 1931 by the Standard Oil Company of California, who obtained a 55 years lease in 193M and formed the Bahrain Petroleum Company, which is registered in Canada, Output in 1938 ms tons, and the industry employs / 5.000simple but odd-shaped^pontrivances of reeds^nd 'vvicker, end one of tjje odcwe^t thii about them is^-ttiat, if sold, they vm.ll ofton fetch consider^bl^reoro uhan^&gt;2ff } 000 eaqhi a good rule to bd&amp;e nothing and nobodvpet^ face-value in-the -^ast, . r G-oin^. eastwards down the Gulf the jurisdiction of the Political .’..gent, Bahrain, extends' .to the peninsula of Qatar and to Trucial Oman, usually knovm as the faucial Coast.

In 1935 the Shaikh .gave a 75-yoar concession to Petroleum Concessions As. ., the development company of the Iraq Petroleum Company, which i' jointly 0 5 British, American, French and Turkish interests.

Inland praotically ho boundaries are agreed on and the roving Bedouin pay allegiance to one Shaikh or to another - or to none at all - as the spirit moves them. To understand the rather complex position it is necessary to go back and look briefly at the exceedingly interesting history of the Coast.-*24- In tho past the people of the Pirate Coast (as it used to he called) have had. four flourishing industries - Pirac 3 r, Slave-Trading, Gun-Running, and Pearl Diving. The British, as the chief western power, found themselves compelled to put an end to the first three and the Japanese nearly killed the last with their cultured '’h pc axis in the years before the war. The history of British relations with the Coast in their early years is the history of the Expression of piracy. The piratical Arabs were then lx own collectively as Jowasimis from the family name of their Shaikhs, from whom the present-day Shaikhs of Sharjah, Ras ul Khainah, and Kalba are descended. They made convincing pirates, as we read from contemp orary descriptions, ’They are of the sect of the Wahahees, and are called Joasimee; but God preserve us from them, for they' are' monsters. Their occupation is piracy, and their delight murderj and to make it worse the}'' give you the most pious reasons for every villainy they commit. They abide by the letter of the sacred volume, rejecting all commentaries and traditions. If you are their captive, and you offer all you possess to save your life, the}'' say, ‘NoJ it is written in the Koran that it is unlawful to plunder tho diving, but we are not prohibited in that sacred work from stripping the dead 1 ; so saying they knock you on the head. But then, that is * not so much their fault, for they are descended from a Haul, or monster, and act according to their nature.’ But they had their virtues, as we, read elsewhere, ’The most undaunted bravery was certainly theirs. If taken, they submitted with resignation to the fate they inflicted on others; and when they fell into the hands of the Persians, or cony nations by which the}'' were surrounded they v/ere never spared, ^fter the destruction of one of their forts, several of them were brought on board one of our ships as prisoners* While uncertain of their fate, and before their wounds were dressed, it was asked what treatment they anticipated. ’The same immediate death as we should have inflicted on you, had your fortune been ours’, was the stem- and characteristic reply. 1 At first, while they plundered all local vessels indiacriminately, they were careful to respect all foreign shipping, and British captains had the strictest orders never to provoke them in any way; but, in 1797, a British ship was forcibly detained by them for two days, Y/hen no retaliation was forthcoming they grew bolder, and another British ship (from whom they had previously borrowed the powder and shot necessary) was attacked. The British put up with this sort of /thingthing until 1806 when the pirate fleet was blodsaded at Qishm and forced to sue for peace. The Jowasinis promised to restore captured vessels and Ho respect the flag and propert 3 r of the Honourable Hast India Company and their subjects’; but the lesson was not sharp enough and the attacks soon began again, and spread from^the west coast of India to the Red Sea, A typical case was that of the I j.nerva t which, after a running fight of two days, was carried by boarding, 1 The commander, with full knowledge of the cruel fate which awaited him, attempted to blow his vessel up, but unfortunately failed, and the slaughter of the victims commenced. The ship was first ’purified* vdth water and perfumes, and, this accomplished, the different individuals were bound and brought forward singly to the gangway,.where one of the pirates cut their throats, in the name of Cod, 1 The Pirate fleet had by now grown to nearly a thousand ships manned by over nineteen thousand men, and the East India Cctnpany decided to take active measures against them.

This treaty,however, while outlawing piracy, did not prohibit inter-tribal warfare at sea which, in practice, was almost the same thing, and in 1835 the chiefs were persuaded to sign a six—month maiitime • ■ i truce prohibiting all hostilities by sea.* This enabled them to carry on their pearl-diving without interruption and proved such a boon to all of them that they readily agreed to renew it annually until 1843, then for ten years, and finally, in 1853, for ever.

RELIGION .HID I ^ JETERS The customs and manners of the Arabs are conditioned by their climate ana religion. The less said about their climate the better, but it is important to know something about their religion. Six hundred years after Christ, ijrabia was a battleground of savage and primitive tribes who v/orshipped numberless ^ uA bk l ofl O^t c _ 11.

Then appeared and called the people to the worship of tho One, the only God, the God of .,braham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob - and of Jesus. After early vicissitudes the new religion made remarkable headway, and in a few years welded the Arab tribes into one inspired whole. Their armies carried their faith to India and lialaya in the East, iiorocco and Spain in the V/'ost, the Balkans and Central Asia in the North, and to iifrica in the South. And for all these countries the Qoran, the Muslim scriptures, provided a code of law and behaviour usually preferable to any they had had before. The central pillar of Islam is that there is only one God, and the making of pictures and images of men or beasts is therefore forbidden lest ignorant men should be led astray into*worshipping them. Por this reason mosques are simple and austere, decorated only by texts from the Qoran. Muslims must pray five times a day, and must wash their faces, hands and their feet before prayer; they arc forbidden to drink wine or to eat the flesh of pigs. Por one month in the year (Ramazan) they may not eat, drink, or smoke between sunrise and sunset. They may have four wives, but only the very rich can afford to have more than one. ritual duties •«***—laid upon them. They hold that Jesus Christ and the Old Testament prophets ^we^e ^tn ie prophets, but that n coming after them, modified^many of their ordinances and is therefore to be followed where there is disagreement. Remember, when you see ^uul-irr*-? praying, that they are worshipping the same God that we v/orship, and that they are very serious about it. Never interrupt them or pass near them. There is a tacit understanding in .jrab countries that Christians hold to their own religion and respect that of the Muslims and vice versa. ajrabs arc sensitive about their religion and are quick to resent any real or imagined slight, so one.must be careful not to give offence and, unless one is on very intimate toms, it is safest not to discuss religion with them.The Qoran Closely bound up v/ith religion is the question ox woricn. enjoins that wonen should conceal their faces Iron all non except their hueDanes and near relations, and this injunction is strictly xolloved oy the ^raos.

Besides being unhurried you should be quiet and dignified - boisterousness is considered very bad manners. Usually, in an Arab assembly, the seats furtnest iron tne aoor are for the exalted and those nearest the door for the lowly of station. It is gooa manners to remember the Biblical injunction ana take a lowly seam fou will Aren be pressed to 1 go up higher’ and may, with becoming reluctance, comply. Normally the visitor and the visited confine their conversation for the lirst few minutes to repeated formal enquiries after each other’s health. Coffee and perhaps sweet neats are then brought and business may be discussed. Two or three cups of coffee may be taken and you should then shake the cup as you hand it back to the servant as a sign that you have had enough. Eat the food only with your right hand, never touch it with your left;among Easterners the left hand is reserved for unclean tasks and is never used for eatings You should not point the sole of the foot towards an *,rab or stretch your legs out in front of you if you are sitting on the floor. In Kuwait and Iraq it is a sign that the guests should take their leave when the host calls for tho incense to be passed round, but tie passing of incense does not have this significance further down the gulf.It is usually not possible when receiving ^n.’a'bs to arrange for all this ritual, but if a reputable i.rab couos to see you ho should always be ofiered a chair and any refroslr.ient (except alcohol) that nay be going. You nay have heard tliat Orientals arc cunning and deceitful, and, to a certain extent, they are: but never attenpt to c iploy those arts when dealing with then or they will get the better of you. They have cone to expect good faith and straightforwardness from us, and these will pay you best. Politeness costs only a little effort and will pay big dividends in willing co-operation, and by treating the people among whom you live with courtesy and kindness and by showing every consideration for their point of view you will be doing your country a service.NOTE ON CURRENCY. In Persia the Kran (l80 Krans=£l) is the ■unit of currency, but the Tenon (=t!0 Krans) is usually used in computing large suns. The -iron ^ is divided into 100 D inars . There is no coin of the value of one kran, the largest being worth 50 Dinars and called a n_in Kra nc Other coins are the Sha&amp;i. of five Dinars and the S annar of ten Dinars . There are notes for 5*10,20,100, etc., Krans . In the Arab States Indian currency is used. The unit is the Rupee (13 1/2 Rupees = £l) and it is divided into 16 i-nnas. One Rupee equals Is 6d and three Rupees are equal to one Dollar. There are coins for 1,2,^, and 8 annas, as well as for Pies (12 to one Anna) and Pice (4 to an Anna). Notes are for two, five, ten, fifty, one hundred Rupees, and upwards In Saudi .Arabia the currency unit is the silver Dollar worth about Is 2d,MM. ' Telephone Number: EUSton 4321.

My (a) and (c) were meant to clarify the difficulty which I see about volunteering for American personnel a British text regarding the terri- tory of third parties. While I do not know the local present day background it might, from some points of view, have made it less difficult to get away with this if we could say that we were also distributing ourselves. On the other hand, to do so would involve finance from British or Indian sources. If Indian revenues cannot Pay then ’ unless y° u wa nt to go to the Treasury, you will probaoly have to try to get the Ministry of Information to produce and pay for it, and I would not rate your chances of success too high. It would seem then that the practical course would be either to persuade a British commercial concern to bring it out for you, and then present it to the U.S. War Department for use by their Army Air Force personnel, or to get the matter taken up discreetly and personally with the War Department in Washington and persuade them that there is a real need for such a pamphlet, for which we should be willing to supply the basis. (We should have, of course, to risk mutilation). There is, I should say, no chance at all of any American body - unless it were the companies themselves, locally - agreeing to distribute to American civilians, though copies of a War Department pamphlet would probably find their way /intointo civilian hands. If the second alternative strikes you as worth while you will no doubt he writing to the Eastern Department, Foreign Office, who will presumably consult Mr* Dudley of the North American Department, who handles this sort of thing. Before, however, taking the matter any further I would advise a telephone call to Mr. Waybright of O.W.I., at the American Embassy here, in order to make sure that the War Department have not already got a pamphlet such as Captain Tandy envisages. I do not, of course, agree with General Moleswortt^s minute !K Captain Tandy, -.iiio has, just returned on leave from the Persian Culf, v/hei^ he has been Political Officer on'the Trucial Coast, has suggested to me unofficially that it might be a good idea if a booliler^ could be prepared in an easily readable form on the political status, customs and history of the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Culf. ,/hat he has in mind is that it should be of value ^ particularly to American Air Force personnel and other, Americans, v/ho are now coming to tlie Persian Gulf in fairly considerable numbers, ap,d who are usually entirely ignorant of local conditions and the people there. He has six months leave in- this country and I gathet v/o»uld be glad'.to ufidertake the Job without any financial reward. He had it in mind to ask* the Americans himself ^iiether tliey would like such a booklet produced for them, but it occurs to me that there may be some Joint Anglo-American Committee whose function it is to consider the production of publications of this sort. If you think there is anything in the idea, I could discuss the matter further with him, or put him in touch with the appropriate authority*■* ■' . ^ t ftA4 ^ t C. . 7/- tZmJt ^ ^ t t ^ A uUAL lu^ iJm). ^ sLu/&lt; \/cX\ £ Irrnrfact , \ luLA, oJU^&gt; ^ far* \ A -</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000517.0x000029_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/933</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x000029</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/933</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Ext 3485/44 ‘Capt M P O'C Tandy: Book for the Ministry of Information about the Persian Gulf’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1944/1949</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-03-23T10:43:47</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (141 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 143; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains papers concerning proposals for the publication of a guide on the history, political, and economic situation of the Persian Gulf by the Ministry of Information, primarily for British and American service personnel serving in the Gulf.
