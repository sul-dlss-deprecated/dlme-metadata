It explains that the Resident has refrained from protesting in order to obtain proof of the Governor's complicity with Abdool Mahomed in establishing a monopoly on grain; it describes how grain was loaded for export while a prohibition as a result of scarcity was in force.Enclosed with the letter are copies of communications between Hajee Abdool Nubbee, merchant employed by Mr Ruffay; the Governor of Bunder Rig [Bandar-e RÄ«g]; and the Governor of Bushire. The Resident hopes that they will justify his conduct in the above mentioned affair. The item has seven enclosures:1 - Translation of a note from the Governor of Bushire to Hajee Ahmed, the Arabic Secretary to the Residency, received 12 September 1851.The enclosure explains that the ship from the Mauritius will be permitted to depart with a cargo of grain, but that other ships will not. This is in consequence of scarcity; a price increase; and the number of troops and public servants currently stationed in the locality.2 - Translation of the Resident's reply to the Governor of Bushire, sent through Hajee Ahmed, dated 13 September 1851.The enclosure explains that it is the opinion of the Resident that the loading of grain on to the ship from Mauritius should not have created a scarcity, or risk of famine in the district. It further states that the Resident can only accept a prohibition on the export of grain if it is applied to all equally.3 - Translation of a letter from the Governor of Bushire to Hajee Ahmed, in reply to No. 2, dated 13 September 1851.The enclosure is explaining that loading the ships [sic] from the Mauritius has caused an increase in the price of grain, which has alarmed the local population; the Governor is therefore willing to give up his customs duties to avoid causing them 'distress and misery'. It further states that it should be evident to the Resident that the prohibition on the export of grain is general, and that he should report anyone he finds in breach of it.4 - Translation of a note from Hajee Abdool Nubbee to the Governor of Bushire, dated September 1851.The enclosure is representing that the author has purchased grain for the Captain at Bunder Rig; a portion has arrived, but a portion remains as a result of the Governor's prohibition on exports.5 - Translation of the Governor of Bushire's reply to Hajee Abdool Nubbee's note No. 4, received September 1851.The enclosure explains that if the wheat in question belongs to Hajee Abdool Nubbee, then its export will not be prohibited.6 - Translation of a letter from Shaikh Abdoolah, Governor of Bunder Rig, dated 4 October 1851.The letter is explaining that the Governor has received instructions from the Dureya Beggee indicating that he is to take security from any merchant of Bushire purchasing grain at Bunder Rig, in order to ensure it is in fact imported to Bushire. It further mentions that permission to export grain to another destination can only be obtained from the Dureya Beggee.7 - Translation of a letter from Hajee Abdool Houssein, Zabil of Bunder Rig, sent about 4 October 1851.The enclosure repeats the content of enclosure No. 4. It also notes two boats that have carried away wheat, and returned with a cargo of that article for Bushire; it requests instructions on how to proceed.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023667520.0x000020#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
