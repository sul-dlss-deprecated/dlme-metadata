Most of the file consists of policy discussion – prompted by a letter from Colonel Alexander Stalker Lancaster, dated 13 April 1941, folios 23-31 – as to how this position should be developed considering wartime limitations, and the potential for foreign competitors to challenge Britain's position. The countries examined are Italy, Russia, Germany, France, Japan, and the United States.A small amount of correspondence related to the Afghan Government's decision to postpone consideration of the purchase of Tiger Moth trainer aircraft (folios 4-6) has also been included in the file.Most of the correspondence is generated by HM Minister at Kabul: William Kerr Fraser-Tytler and Francis Verner Wylie. Contributions from the Air Ministry, the Foreign Office, the India Office, and the Government of India are also present.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Afghan Air Force</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Military Attaché</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Landing grounds</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Afghanistan</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Afghanistan</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Military aviation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00023e#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00023e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
