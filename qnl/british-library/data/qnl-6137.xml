To ALL TO WHOM THESE PRESENTS SHALL COME, GREETING ! Whereas by a Royal Charter under the Great Seal bearing date at Westminster the Second day of September, in the fifty-third year of the reign of her late Majesty Queen Victoria (hereinafter referred to as the Original Charter) a Company was incorporated under the name of the Imperial Bank of Persia with a Common Seal for the term of thirty years commencing from the date of the Original Charter, for the purpose of carrying on the business of a Banker in Persia but not elsewhere save and except as in the Original Charter mentioned and subject to such restrictions and provisions as were therein contained : And whereas by the Original Charter the capital of the said Company was fixed at the sum of £1,000,000 sterling divided into shares of £10 each with power for the said Company from time to time by special resolution to increase the capital but so that the total capital should never exceed £4,000,000 sterling : And whereas all of such 100,000 shares of £10 each have been issued and the full sum of £10 has been called for and paid up on each of such shares : And whereas by Clause 12 of the Original Charter it was provided that if the said Company should become insolvent every proprietor for the time being of any share in the capital of the Company should be individually liable to contribute not only such part or parts of every share held by such proprietor as should not have been theretofore called for and paid up, but also such further sums of money not exceeding the full amount of the share or shares held by such proprietor in the capital of the said Company as should be requisite and necessary to pay satisfy and discharge the debts engagements and liabilities of the said Company so that each proprietor should, for the purposes aforesaid, be liable to pay and contribute in addition to the amount of every share held by him a further sum equal to the amount of such share or shares :2 And whereas by Clause 16 of the Original Charter it was (inter alia) provided that the Deed of Settlement of the said Company should provide for special resolutions being passed in like manner as special resolutions under the Companies Act, 1862 : And whereas by a Supplemental Charter bearing date the 17th day of December, 1894 (which Supplemental Charter is hereinafter referred to as the First Supplemental Charter) the capital of the said Company was reduced from £1,000,000 sterling to the sum of £650,000 sterling divided into 100,000 shares of £6 10s. Od. each and it was thereby provided that notwithstanding such reduction of capital every proprietor for the time being of every share in the said Company should if the said Company should become insol vent be individually liable to contribute not only such part or parts of the sum of £10 originally payable upon every share held by such proprietor as had not been theretofore called for and paid up, if any, but also such further sums of money not exceeding £10 per share for every share held by such proprietor as should be requisite and necessary to pay, satisfy and discharge the debts, engagements and liabilities of the said Company : And whereas by Supplemental Charters bearing date respectively the 21st day of January, 1920, the 24th day of July, 1922, the 1st day of September, 1924 and the 24th day of May, 1935 (which Supplemental Charters are, together with the First Supplemental Charter, hereinafter collectively referred to as “ the Supplemental Charters ”) alterations have been made in the provisions of the Original Charter in connection with an extension of the term during which the said Company should continue incor porated for a further period, the establishment of branch banks elsewhere than in Persia, a further extension of the term during which the said Company should continue incorporated for a further period, making a total term of fifty-nine years and one hundred and fifty days expiring on the 30th day of January, 1949, and the alteration of the name of the said Company from the Imperial Bank of Persia to the Imperial Bank of Iran : And whereas application has been made to Us by the said Company for such amendment of the Original Charter as altered by the First Supplemental Charter as will provide for the increase of the capital of the said Company from the sum of £650,000 sterling to the sum of £1,000,000 sterling in manner hereinafter appearing and will provide for the alteration of the provisions of the Originalt barter in relation to the passing of special resolutions by the said Company : Now know ye that as well upon the prayer of the said Company as also of Our special grace certain knowledge and mere motion WE DO BY THESE PRESENTS WILL AND ORDAIN RS follows ! 1. From and after the time when this Our Supplemental Charter shall have been accepted by a Special Resolution and also the amendments of the Deed of Settlement of the said Company rendered necessary by this Our Supplemental Charter shall have been effected by a like resolution and approved as hereinafter required by the Commissioners of Our Treasury the following provisions shall have effect namely :— (a) The capital of the said Company shall be increased from the sum of £650,000 sterling to the sum of £1,000,000 sterling by the increase of the amount of the existing shares from £6 10s. Od. each to £10 each. (b) The sum of £350,000 sterling out of the assets of the Company (being as to £200,000 thereof the amount received by the Company from the Iranian Government for the surrender of the Company’s note issue and as to £150,000 thereof part of the amount held by the Company by way of provision for contingencies, shall be capitalised and applied by the Company in paying up the sum of £3 10s. Od. upon each of the shares whose amount has been so increased. (c) The Deed of Settlement of the said Company shall provide for special resolutions being passed in like manner as special resolutions under the Companies Act, 1929 or any statutory modification or any re-enactment thereof and not in the manner in which special resolutions are to be passed under the Companies Act, 1862 and the Original Charter and the Supplemental Charters including these presents shall thence forth be read and considered in all respects as though nn\ reference therein to a special resolution referred to a special resolution passed in manner provided for by these presents. (d) The draft of the amendments of the Deed of Settlement rendered necessary by this Our Supplemental Charter shall be submitted for approval to the Commissioners of Our Treasury before any resolution is passed for the purpose of giving effect to such amendments, and if such Commissioners certify to us4 \ » within twelve months after the date of this Our Supplemental Charter that the amendments so approved by them have not been carried into effect, it shall be lawful for Us, Our heirs and successors, at any time thereafter by writing under Our Great Seal, to declare this Our Supplemental Charter to be absolutely void. 2. If the said Company shall become insolvent every pro prietor for the time being of any of the said shares of £10 each resulting from the increase of capital effected by Sub-Clause (a) of Clause 1 hereof shall notwithstanding that such shares are fully paid be individually liable to contribute such further sums of money not exceeding £10 per share for every such share held by such pro prietor as shall be requisite and necessary to pay satisfy and discharge the debts engagements and liabilities of the said Company but so that the amount which such proprietor is so liable to contribute shall not be increased by the increase of the amount of each such share effected by these presents. 3. The increase of capital effected by this Our Charter and the application of the said sum of £350,000 in manner hereby provided shall not increase or reduce the amount which any proprietor in the Company shall be entitled to receive by way of dividend or otherwise upon his shares, and Article 105 as altered by a Special Resolution of the said Company confirmed on the 16th day of January, 1895 shall be further altered accordingly by deleting the words added to such Article by the said Special Resolution. 4. All the provisions of the Original Charter and the Supple mental Charters, save as amended or varied by this Our Charter, shall continue in full force and effect. 5. This Our Charter shall be deemed to be supplemental to the Original Charter and the Supplemental Charters, and shall be construed and have effect accordingly.

STATEMENT BY THE CHAIRMAN. REPORT AND ACCOUNTS for the year ended 20th March, 1945. f 9 I must first express our sorrow at the loss of an old friend and colleague on the Board, Mr. W. A. Buchanan, who died on the 6th of May last. Mr. Buchanan, who was actively engaged throughout his long career in shipping and trading interests in the Persian Gulf, joined our Board in 1910. He had a vigorous and discerning mind, and much practical wisdom and sound business ability. I recall with particular appreciation his unfailing goodwill and ready helpfulness and harmonious co-operation in all our concerns. Our thanks are again due to our staff for their whole hearted co-operation and good work. It is a pleasure to us in London to see those members of our small British Staff abroad who can be spared for home leave. Our Accounts this year continue the record of expanding deposits and great liquidity. Our Deposits have increased by over 9 per cent, to ^22,100,000. Our total deposits are six-and-a-half times the amount at which they stood on 20th March, 1939. In the same period of six years the cost of living in Iran and Iraq, as it happens, has increased in much the same proportion. The increase of ^693,000 in the Bills Payable item in our Accounts is mainly in outstanding drafts and sums due to other banks. The total of Credits and Guarantees shews a moderate but welcome increase in credits opened by our offices abroad. We hope to see further expansion in this part of our business, simultaneously with the gradual return to peace-time pro duction and supply of goods. Against the continued increase in our deposits there is again a reduction of /l,000,000 in our Discounts and Advances. When money is over-plentiful, and there is a shortage of goods and transport, the trader has little need to borrow. This state of affairs is also answerable for a further moderate reduc- ✓—'“stion in the total of Bills Receivable, mainly in bills arising from the movement of goods inside Iran. As a result of increased deposits and reduced opportunities for their employment in financing external and internal commerce, there is an increase of ^3,816,000 in our Cash and Investments. Our holdings of British Govern ment securities are up by ^1,200,000. Cash and Money at Call is ^2,600,000 higher than last year, and the total of this item represents 76 per cent, liquid cover for our deposits. Our Profit shews a moderate increase. We have added £50,000 to the Reserve, and we propose to pay the same dividend as we have paid for the preceding six years. The Carry Forward will thus be increased by £5,286. The official exchange rates for sterling in Iran have been kept unchanged since May, 1942, at 128 rials buying rate and 130 rials per £ selling rate. There is still an ample supply of sterling as a result of British Government disbursements, and transactions in sterling-area exchange are not restricted. U.S. Dollars, at the official rates of 32-321 ria l s per Dollar, are in restricted supply, and the dollar enjoys a premium of some ten rials in the open market. American exports, which are in more liberal supply than British goods, are in eager demand in markets which have been starved of all sorts of imports.

The currency of Iran, which is the note issue of the Bank Melli (with recent helpful issues of silver coin for the lower values) has reached the equivalent of some ^50 millions in circulation. The considerable expansion in the cir culation since 1942 is fully covered by gold and foreign exchange. There have been substantial sales of Government gold in Teheran over the past two years, in the form of small bars and coin. The gold is bought by dealers and finds its way illicitly to Syria and even to countries in Europe whose paper does not inspire confidence or whose exchange has hitherto not been available. Sales of gold by the British Government have ceased, but sales by the Bank Melli continue. Good harvests are expected in Iran this year, and there are satisfactory reserves of wheat. Wholesale prices of commodities have been falling, but there is an appreciable time-lag in many cases before these reductions benefit the consumer. The process of reducing Anglo-American activities on the supply lines to Russia is under way. There have been several changes of Cabinet in the Iranian capital. Dr. Millspaugh has returned to the United States, but many of the Americans engaged through him remain in the service of the Iranian Government. The steep grading of direct taxation has not found acceptance to a workable degree. The range of wealth and poverty throughout the country has perhaps been extended rather than shortened. The events of the war have added weight to Russian influence in the northern provinces of Iran. Business in Iraq has been somewhat less active throughout the past year. Prices of grain for export moved to moderately lower levels after the last harvest, and the 1944 date crop was poor. Exports from India have been severely restricted. Iraq finances are in good shape, and the Government plans include the expenditure of ^4,250,000 on railway improvement over a three-year period. In January, 1945, two internal loans of ^1,000,000 each were floated in Baghdad, one for three years at 3 per cent., the other for twenty years at 2 per cent., the second loan carrying a further distribution of 2 per cent, in prize drawings. Both these loans have commanded a premium since their issue. Their object was partly the absorption of purchasing power. The proceeds are earmarked for railway and irrigation expenditure. As a result partly of these issues and of lower prices for agricultural produce the expansion of deposits and of currency in circulation in Iraq has ceased. There is extensive contraband traffic to and from Iran. Most goods entering Iraq by legitimate means are now under Government control from the time of entry until they are sold to the consumer. We opened last December a branch at Bahrain, an island centre in the Persian Gulf, which has intimate trading relations with Iran and elsewhere in addition to its oilfield and its pearl fisheries.

Mr. Spinney, Mana^ang Director of Spinney's told me on the 20th March, 1948 that he was contemplating establish ing a new company entitled Spinney's (Persian Gulf; Limited with itsl head office in Kuwait, and asked me (a) Whether the company would then be considered a British or a Kuwaiti one, (b) Whether it would be subject to income-* or other taxes, and . (c) Whether there would be any objection from the political point of view. ?• , I replied to (a) that the company would, I thought, be considered a British one, and should be registered in the Agency: and to (b) that it would presumably be liaole to no taxes. To (c) I replied that I could see no objection provided the company confined itself to supplying the Oil Company and did not endeavour to trade with the Kuwaities. 3. ^ I advised Spinney to refer to you on the question of whether it would not be better to register the company in Bahrain (it will also deal with supplies to Petroleum Concessions Limited in Qatar although mpst of its work will be in Kuwait) as the more stable and systematic form of Government there might give better protection against local interference.

The Directors may decline to recognise any instrument of transfer unless {a) a fee not exceeding three shillings is paid to the Company in respect thereof, and (b) the instrument of transfer is accompanied by the certificate of the shares to which it relates, and such other evidence as the Directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer. 23. On the death of any member the executors, administrators, or persons named as his successors by a competent court shall be the only persons recognised by the Company as having any title to such share. In the case of a share registered in the names of two or more holders, the survivors or survivor, or the executors or administrators of the deceased survivor, shall be the only persons recognised by the Company as having any title to the share. 24. Any person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death or bank ruptcy of a member shall, upon such evidence being produced as may from time to time be required by the Directors, have the right, either to be registered as a member in respect of the share or, instead of being registered himself, to make such transfer of the share as the deceased or bankrupt person could have made ; but the Directors shall, in either case have the same right to decline or suspend registration as they would have had in the case of a transfer ot the share by the deceased or bankrupt person before the death or bankruptcy. 25. A person becoming entitled to a share by reason of the death or bankruptcy of the holder shall be entitled to the same dividends and other advantages to which he would be entitled if he were the registered holder of the share, except that he shall not, before being registered as a member in respect of the share, be entitled in respect of it to exercise any right conferred by membership in relation to meetings of the Company. FORFEITURE OF SHARES. 26. If a member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call on the day appointed for payment thereof, the Directors may. at any time thereafter during such time as any part of such call or instalment remain unpaid, serve a notice on him 'requiring payment of so much of the call or instalment as is unpaid, together with any interest which may have accrued. 27. 1 he notice shall name a further day, not earlier than the expiration of fourteen days from the date of the notice, on or before which the payment required by the notice is to be made, and shall state that in the event of non-payment at or before the time appointed the shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited. 28. If the requirements of any such notice as aforesaid are not complied with, any share in respect of which the notice has been given may at any time thereafter, before the payment required by the notice has been made, be forfeited bv a resolution of the Directors to that effect. 29. A forfeited share may be sold or otherwise disposed of on such terms and in such manner as the Directors think fit, and at any time before the sale or disposition the torfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit. 3 °- A person whose shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a member in respect of the forfeited shares, but shall, notwithstanding, remain liable to pay to the Company all moneys which, at the date ot forfeiture, were presently payable by him to the Company in lespect of the shares, but his liability shall cease if and when the Company receive payment in full of the nominal amount of the shares. 3 1 - A declaration upon oath that the declarant is a Director of the Company, and t at a share in the Company has been duly forfeited on a date stated in the declaration.1 I signing any reason, decline to lid shares, to a person of whom ly transfer of shares on which nd the registration of transfers inary General Meeting in each ument of transfer unless (a) a in respect thereof, and (6) the &gt;f the shares to which it relates, y require to show the right of ninistrators, or persons named ly persons recognised by the ;e of a share registered in the the executors or administrators ised by the Company as having lequence of the death or bank- uced as may from time to time gistered as a member in respect lake such transfer of the share it the Directors shall, in either ion as they would have had in ikrupt person before the death &gt;n of the death or bankruptcy other advantages to which he share, except that he shall not, are, be entitled in respect of it i to meetings of the Company. 3. of a call on the day appointed eafter during such time as any tice on him requiring payment r with any interest which may :han the expiration of fourteen &gt;ayment required by the notice payment at or before the time e will be liable to be forfeited. esaid are not complied with, y at any time thereafter, before arfeited by a resolution of the osed of on such terms and in before the sale or disposition irectors think fit. ease to be a member in respect liable to pay to the Company ayable by him to the Company id when the Company receive Director of the Company, and date stated in the declaration, S' if shall be conclusive evidence of the facts therein stated as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the share, and that declaration, and the receipt of the Company for the consideration, if any, given for the share on the sale or disposition thereof shall constitute a good title to the share, and the person to whom the share is sold or disposed of shall be registered as the holder of the share and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, if any, nor shall his title to the share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale or disposal of the share. 32. The provisions of these regulations as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the amount of the share, or by way of premium, as if the same had been payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified. ALTERATION OF SHARE CAPITAL 33. The Directors may, with the sanction of a special resolution of the Company, increase the capital by the creation of new shares, such aggregate increase to be of such amount and to be divided into shares of such respective amounts as the resolution shall prescribe. 34. Subject to any direction to the Company that may be given by the resolution sanctioning the increase of share capital, all new shares shall before issue be offered to such persons as at the date of the offer are entitled to receive from the Company notices of General Meetings in proportion, as nearly as the circumstances admit, to the amount of the existing shares to which they are entitled. Such offer shall be made by notice specifying the number of shares offered, and limiting a time within which the offer, if not accepted, will be deemed to be declined, and after the expiration of such time or on the receipt of an intimation from the person to whom the offer is made that he declines to accept the shares offered, the Directors may dispose of the same in such manner as they think most beneficial to the Company. 35. The Directors may also dispose as they think fit of any new shares which (by reason of the ratio which the new shares bear to shares held by persons entitled to an offer of new shares) cannot in the opinion of the Directors be conveniently offered under the preceding article. 36. Any capital raised by the creation of new shares shall, unless otherwise provided by the conditions of issue, be considered as part of the original capital, and shall be subject to the same provisions with reference to the payment of calls and the forfeiture of shares on non-payment of calls, transfer and transmission of shares, lien or otherwise as if it had been part of the original capital. 37. The Company may by Special Resolution : (a) Sub-divide its existing shares or any of them into shares of smaller amount than is fixed by the Memorandum of Association ; provided that in the sub-division of the existing shares the proportion between the amount paid and the amount (if any) unpaid on each share of reduced amount shall be the same as it was in the case of the existing share from which the share of reduced amount is divided. (b) Reduce its capital in any manner allowed by law. (c) Consolidate and divide all or any of its capital into shares of larger amount than its existing shares. (d) Cancel any shares which at the date of the passing of the resolution have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person. GENERAL MEETINGS. 38. An Ordinary General Meeting of the Company shall be held once in every calendar year at such time and place in Cyprus or elsewhere as may be prescribed by the Directors, but so that not more than fifteen months shall be allowed to elapse between12 any two such General Meetings. In default of a General Meeting being so held, a General Meeting shall be held in the month next following and may be convened by any two members in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which meetings are to be convened by the Directors. 39. The Directors may, whenever they think fit, and they shall, upon a requisition made in writing by members holding at the date of the requisition not less than one -tenth of the paid up capital of the Company, convene an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company. If at any time there shall not be present in Cyprus sufficient Directors to form a quorum, the Directors elsewhere found and capable of acting (or if there shall be no such Directors, then any two members) may convene an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which meetings may be convened by the Directors. 40.

Notwithstanding the provisions of the last preceding Article, a meeting may, with the written consent of all the members, be convened by less than fourteen days’ notice, and in such manner as the members may think fit. 43. The business of an Ordinary General Meeting shall be to receive and consider the accounts and balance sheets and the reports of the Directors and Auditors, to elect Directors in place of those retiring, to appoint Auditors and fix their remuneration, and to sanction a dividend.

If a poll is demanded or directed in the manner above-mentioned, it shall (subject to the provisions of the next succeeding Article thereof) be taken at such time and in such manner as the Cha’rman may appoint, and the result of such poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded. In the case of an equality of votes at any General Meeting, whether upon a show of hands or on a poll, the Chairman shall be entitled to a second or casting vote. In case of any dispute as to the admission or rejection of any vote, the Chairman shall determine the same, and such determination made in good faith shall be final and conclusive. 50.

Such reserve may be applied for the purpose of maintaining the property of the Company, replacing wasting assets, meeting contingencies, forming a gratuity fund, equalising dividends, paying special dividends or bonuses, or for any other purpose for which the net profits of the Company may lawfully be used, and until the same shall be so applied it shall be deemed to remain undivided profit. The Directors may also carry forward to the accounts of the succeeding year or years any profit or balance of profit which they shall not think fit to divide or to place to reserve. 96. Profits of the Company may be capitalised from time to time if and when thought fit, and the following provisions shall have effect with regard to such capitalisation, namely (a) The Company in General Meeting may at any time and from time to time, upon the recommendation of the Directors, pass a resolution to the effect that it is desirable to capitalise any sum of undivided profits of the Company for the time being (including profits carried and standing to any reserve or reserves or other special account), and accordingly that the Directors be authorised and directed to appropriate and apply such sums of profits in paying up in full unissued shares of the Company of a nominal amount equal thereto, and to allot and distribute such shares credited as fully paid up and by way of capitalisation of profits to any amongst the members in proportion to the number of issued shares held by them respectively.
