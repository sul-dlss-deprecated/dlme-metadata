It is one of the earliest examples of what in later Byzantine times was called Eleousa, or \"Virgin of Tenderness.\"  The relief was likely to have been used for private devotion, in either a monastic or domestic setting, as an icon (Greek for \"image\").  Especially striking and typical of the early medieval period in Christian Egypt are the Virgin's large head, fixed gaze, and angular drapery.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1905", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/6580", "Keywords": "Byzantine art; icon; Virgin; Christ; tusk; devotion; Madonna; Jesus Christ", "Provenance": "Cologne, 1870s; M.-B.
