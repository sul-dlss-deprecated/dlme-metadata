An additional foliation sequence is present in parallel between ff 3-147; these numbers are also written in pencil, but are not circled. A previous foliation sequence between ff 3-15 and between ff 87-147, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This volume contains political and administrative diary entries filed by the Political Agent in Muscat at two week intervals. The subject matter of the entries varies greatly and covers: British political interests; local political affairs; visits of dignitaries; meteorological information; shipping; and tribal affairs. The more extensive entries narrate events that involve the Sultan of Muscat and Oman, or major political figures in Oman, and that may have political implications locally or internationally.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Political affairs</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Oman</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Visits</topic></subject><subject><topic>Shipping</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000086#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
