An additional foliation sequence is present in parallel between ff 2-38; these numbers are also written in pencil, but are not circled, and are located in the same position as the main sequence. A previous foliation sequence, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains printed reports on events in India. The series was prepared each month by the Government of India and distributed to its dominions, in this case the Political Agency at Bahrain (via Bushire before 1941).The reports, normally no more than 2 folios in length, are mostly divided into headed sections relating to a different subject (this stops in 1945), as follows:Public Order;The Provinces;Political;India and the War;The North-West Frontier;Indians Overseas (specifically South and East Africa);General.Each report is given a number in accordance with the month it is printed. Not all months are present within the file.Folios 130-31 are internal office notes.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>India</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Colonial administration</topic></subject><subject><topic>Reports</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000104#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
