CO, Recent telegrams from Bahrain and Kuwait show the difficulty of getting at the truth. This difficulty is illustrated 'by the fact that the Shaikh of Kuwait considers that Ihn Saud will never again regain con- -trol of the Akhwan trihes, the Shaikhs of Bahrain are of the opinion that he has never lost control over them and is and must continue to 'be all powerful whatever trihe may do individually and temporarily, while the Shaikh of Dehai, a very intelligent man, agrees with the Shaikhs of^ Bahrain except that he considers that in the end Ihn Saud must fall owing to his religious persecution (hut Dehai is not Wahahi] ^ S3&gt; • I see no reason to qua^L^ ^ previous appreciations. All that can he said is that there is still imminent danger of a raid for which we must he pre- -■pared until such time as we know that the danger has eva- •^rated or some meeting with Ihn Saud has taken place and perhaps cleared the situation. I find it impossihle to 'believe that he is not attempting to control situation ot that he is taking part in a wholesale attack even if cer- -tain local assistance appears to have 'been forced upon him. Money and food he must give even if only to stop raiding. RESIDENT.J) Telegram From To Repeated P. Secretary of State for the ColoniBs, London.

After compliments, I am in receipt of your reply No. ^.0. -79 dated ^rd February 1920, and wish to assure you that vhen the Muham- marah Agreement was drawn up, It was signed by my representa tive, the representative of 'Iraq and the representative of the British High Commissioner for 'Iraq, subject to ratifica- tion by the Kin^s of Najd and 'Iraq. . The copy of the Agreement in question in my possession ■ is not signed by anyone except the representatives alone # and I do not remember sisning any copy to send to 'Iraq. The memoranda which passed at the ' Uqair Conference and the t.vo Protocols drawn up at it were only to remove the defects which prevented me from signing the ;:uham..mrah Agreement. It is a pleasing fact that you quote these documents to substantiate what you say about Ibn ! ijlad in your letter Bio.6 32 dated |Cth June \'j21 and in your letter No. U748 dated 7th November 1927, whom you had already talked of as an 'Iraq subject, but eventually agreed to consider him as a Hajd subject. It is my hope that if you revise the whole question carefully you will be satisfied that the whole purpose of Article I of the 'Uqalr Protocol was for 'Iraq to acknowledge that the Dah&amp;nlshah, who are a aept of the ' Amarat , ire Jajd subjects, as they were not subject to 'Iraq at the time. You qqq that Ibn Ml jlad and all the n. .xshih Hajd subjects by the decree of the 'Uqalr Protocol before Ibn Ml ^lad was subject to me by special 'Iraq laws. Had that not been so the representatives of the British Government and tin representatives of the 'Iraq Government at the 'UqalrConfer ence would have raised the same objection to Ibn Mljlad bslni considered my subject as you do In your last letter.It may be noted toobe noted too that the Dahaaiehah have been located In my territory for a lon^ time, and have obeyed my orders and regulations.

GAMPXMS- SIT^S. A good sampiug site Is available Inside the wall wtilch surrounas the town, with aiaplo room for at least a dlvision on reasonably hard ground. I'here is also unlimited space outside the wall. WATER, The water supply of Kuwait is very limited, and the safari ty of the Inhabitants, and practically all who live near the aea, drink river water laiported from the Shatt al- 1 Arab in special boats. The price of this varies from time to time, but three pies a gallon at the boat side, or six pies deiivared In the town, is about the avera&amp;«» The Shaaiysh wells, less than a mile outside th© Centre Cats of the town, also supply a limited quantity of ^ood water, and soiae people who live far trom the sea find it cheaper to have it brought from them.If sufficient transport were available, these wells would be the obvious water supply for troops. The water is sood, but would not be safe to drink without chlorination. With the exception of a limited quantity of camel- thorn, no fuel of p,ny sort is available. All has to be imported. The town is surrounded on the land side by a mud wall ,30. ye.rd8 long, with three fc^tes and thirty two toweri at intervals along it. The ?irall between the towers is 14^ feet high, and is loopholed for rifle fire throughout the reater part of its length. Iiese towers are one-storied, with a living room on the ground floor. They, and also the gates, make excellent machine and Lewis gun posts, and with the use of sand bags can be transformed into almost ideal emplacements.The towers all project forward from the wall, and give enfilade fire along it. The ground outside the wall i s entirely open, and passable for all arms in all directions. There is a good field of fire for 2,OQC yards from the wall. Beyond this there are certain areas of oroken and dead ground, but they are not extensive, and wopld afford but little cover for advancing troops. An outpost could be established at Qasr as-Sirrah, miles outside the wall. This is a disused, and rather dilapidated,mud fort standing on a slight hill commanding the whole of the surrounding country.

He asks that this complaint may he investigated. He alludes to his former warning that owing .to aeroplane action hands were out against Iraq, and says he has ordered iim Humaid to follow the raiders and to persuade them to return. As he was still not confident he sent his relation SAUD BIN ABDUL AZIZ BIN SAUD ( N.B. usually known as SAUD AL ARAFAH, not IBN SAUD^s son), for the same reason. Owing to critical situation on the frontier Ihn Saud himself proposes to start north a^ter a few days to persuade Nejdis to suspend hostilities until a settlement is reached hy negotiation with H.M's.

Government should 'beforehand sympathetically examine Ihn Saud # s two principal demands i.e. demolition of desert fortifications and mutual surrender of fugitive criminals, and make every effort to put Clayton in a position to satisfy I'bn Saud on these two points. HAJTZ WAHAB was told that we could not express any opinion on these tow points. I do not know to what extent H.M t s.

[E 1458/1/91] No. 1. Consul Stonehewer-Bird to Sir Austen Chamberlain.—{Received March 19.) (No. 29.) Jeddah, February 27, 1928. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith a translation of a letter from Ibn Saud dated the 7th February.The letter, a summary of which was communicated to you in my telegram No. 7 of the 26th instant, is most disappointing in that Ibn Sand, while expressing appreciation of His Majesty's Government's sympathy and desire to promote an understanding, states his inability to meet Colonel Haworth. ^ ) 2. Apart from this refusal, the main interests in the letter lies in Ibn Sauds protest against the use of aeroplanes in his territory. He regards such action as a breach of his sovereign independence. . . , 3. While reasserting his friendship for Great Britain, he protests against British policy in Iraq and Transjordan, a policy in his opinion unduly favourable to the Shereefs. He instances (i) the Treaty of Mohammerah, and (2) the lack of zeal displayed by British officials in insisting on the punishment of raiders instigated by Feisal and Abdullah. 4. He maintains his attitude with regard to the establishment oi a post at Busaiyah. He was unwilling to sign the Uqair Protocol and would not have done so, had he not been convinced that thereunder free access was guaranteed to wells normally frequented by his tribesmen. In spite of his feeling ot icsentment at this breach of treaty obligations ho has restrained bis tribesmen and discountenanced Feisal-ed-Doweish's action. If he has delayed in sending a punitive expedition against the latter, it is because he has no assurance from Iraq that refugees will not be harboured 5. He maintains that the further outbreak of raiding was due to the threat to use aeroplanes against his tribesmen and to the Iraq Premier's expressed desire to send an expedition into Nejd. i--, j ■ n a 6. The dropping in his territory of bombs and proclamations had remilamed tne passions of the tribesmen and placed him as a friend of Great Britain in an impossible position. He could not hope to silence his subjects in the face of this insult to them. ^ 7. The fears of the Nejdis are further increased by information that a post is being built at Mudawara. Mudawara is in territory exclusively inhabited by Nejdis and in which the frontiers have not yet been fixed. 8. Ibn Saud sums up by a formal protest against: (1.) The breach of the Uqair Protocol by the building of posts on the frontier. _ (2.) The endeavour by Iraq officials to incite Nejd tribesmen to rebel against him. (3.) The crossing of the Nejd frontier by aeroplanes and the dropping of crossing warnings, (4.) The breach of inhabitants. (5.) The building of a post at Mudawara international law involved in the bombing ot peaceful 9. The King ends his letter with an expression^ of his confidence that His Majesty's Government will carefully study the points of his protest and will endeavour to extricate him from the impossible position into which he has been thrust by the policy pursued in Iraq.

Proof of this is that Bedouins are 'bringing ghee into town for sale and price has dropped ten dollars. Itm Saud has prohibited trade transactions with TransJordan. HASAN Q.USAIBI, just returned from Hasa, informs me however that the Akhwan are at JUEAB near BURAIDAH, where'they have 'been halted hy IBN SAUD AL AEAFAH. Ihn Saud will leave Hiadh 25th of current Arabic month, meet Akhwan chiers, including Hithlain, at BUEAIDAH and then proceed via HAIL and MEDINA to MECCA. Whole journey 'by motor.

I feel assured that Ihn Saud is even more anxious for peace than we are. Present unsettled con- -ditions contain seed of danger to him and I am certain that a mixture of sympathy with firmness will produce result that we require. But it is necessary that neither we nor he should forget that origin of trouble was the attack on Busaiyah and that he is quite wrong in his 'belief that no wells exist 'between that place and the frontier. Thus the whole groundwork of his contention is without foundation and he has no right to object to the existence of the fort or to demand its not 'being occupied. Its destruction now might he misunderstood. While we desire that Ihn Saud should rule and should control his tribes we cannot forget that he, and still more so his tribes, are Orientals and that therefore if we find it assists our object to meet him in any way ( for instance that the fort should not be occupied to enable him to show that he can control his tribes) it is necessary that he should completely realise that it is a friendly gift from our strength to strengthen him for our common object and not a concession through weakness or a desire to placate tribes of whom we are afraid. TI have 'been strongly against any carossing of his frontier for punishment of trihes until I'bn Saud himself had failed mainly 'because I considered this policy was wrong as policy unless we were forced to it 'by cognate circumstances 'but also 'because I realised that it assisted Ihn Saud to ohscure the main issue viz. his own responsib ility towards us. As long as we desire to hold him responsih- -le for Arabia it is necessary for us to strengthen him not to weaken him, hut in doing so we must pin him to the underlying groundwork of omr policy which, as far as the present issue is concerned, is his responsiMlity for the actions of his trihes. This line of argument may result in certain modifications on his stating his difficulties hut such modifications should he to a common end and he clear in their intention. It may also he stressed that raiding is largely economic and part of the normal life of the trihes, thus only man who can prevent it is Ihn Saud. I still think that a Frontier Commission of an officer from us and one from Ihn Saud ( which officer from us should not he the Political Agent, Kuwait) to watch the frontier and adjudicate would he worth the money until the frontier becomes more settled.

H-izza 1 asked for land on which to Build at Sajia in the ,aBim, (2 days Sast of Hati) but Ibn Sa'wd appeared not to be certain of the seriousness of his intentions. It was freely talked of later, however, that in the eusamer of 3LB2&amp; the Shaflr would coMnence building in Hajd and. that land had bis an allotted, to them. In those discussions it appears that Hassa 1 took the lead on the Bhafir side while 4jai®i took a relatively unimportant part. ijaiiai and iiassn* were then B%ld to be in receipt of pay at the rate of C T. 200 per annum each, md in addition they were lightly taxed. Ixs^le* of this are that all the 4ikat collected fro® 4Jaiicl was returned to them and iiantush 41 Suwait received half of his ^aysents back. The following extract from a report by the Special Service Officer, ^siriyah, dated 2m k^r, XiWf, mm to the reasons for the Dhafir visits is of interest. -Unlike.

ProM Abd ai Aziz ibn Abdurrahman al Faisal to His .ixcellenoy the British Agent and Consul, Jiddah. ft After greetings anr ! respects, e have received youa; v letter dated the 16th January, 1928, Bo t 40/40/9 and were much gratified at the friendly spirit expressed by the British Government to meet our desire to solve the difficulty between Us and 1 Iraq and some questions in the Persian Gulf. We are also glad to note that they selected Colonel Haworth, the Resident in the Persian Gulf, to discuss with Us such questions. We wish that we could meet Colonel Haworth to settle such questions, but it is regretted that the situation has changed since Our first letter and even since that to Your Excellency of the 2nd ohaaban (25 -1-28} , This was due to the precipitation of officials • 'Iraqi and British - in 1 Iraq, We therefore wish that you woulr convey as soon ae possible to His Majesty* e Government the following comaunica- tion of the injustice we have saet with through the British Government officials in 'Iraq and TranesJordan pursuing the Sherif®' policy which has produced and will still procuce the worst re suite in neighbouring; countries and in the good and friendly relations existing between ilajd and the Government of Great Britain, ie will suramarisse as follows: (1) We wish to assure the British Government that we are, before everything, true to Ourselves and u ur people and that such loyalty led Us into friendly relations with the British Government from the commencement of Our political career being confident of the fact that they are true to their promises and that they guard their interests which, we believe, do not run counter to the interests of Our 0 ountrycountry and people. have been true and firm in Our friendship as the British Gorernment well knows, W® would not allow Our confidence in the British OoTernaent to lessen in spite of doubto occasioned by the actions which we will plainly set forth in this letter. Hajd entertained friendly rslatioas with the ^riti^i Government. Bajd is, as all people and the Arab© know, the heart of Arabia, the protector of the race, its religion, character and credit and known as much to all wise Arabs. the Turks and 11 Hussein worked against i^ajd but eTerything was discovered and the menace to removed, the Arabs got in touch with l^ajd but ^ajd would not permit any intervention on the part of other Arabs lest relations with the British Government might be impaired. the attitude of the British Government with the liherifs, however, gave rise to doubts among the people Of i«iajd. These can be summarised as follows, (2) After Faisal*s arrival in 1 Iraq the treaty of iSl MuhBzamerah was forwa rded to '^s and We refused it believing that the 1 Iraq people had no frontiers behind iSs Shutt, but that all the Arabs behind Ks Shutt, Ks Dhafir and ^niza etcet era have always been in submission to the Governor of ^ajd. Th.&amp; people of 1 lrac| used to pay **1 *1 iQiawa' (tax?) to l^ajo loi crossing such frontiers both in the days of &amp;ur x ore fa they#, of A1 Er Kashid and in Our own days. At the meeting of B1 tJqair, in asking Us to recognise some frontiers they had decided upon, the British Government were considerate, sympathetic, difticult or even threatening by turns. Although unnatisfied We accepted the frontiers on cond it ion«► 3 • condition that drinking from the water shoulc be free and that building over the walls and the neighbouring places should be prohibited. The meeting left Us with the impression that Britain inclined towards the 1 Iraq side rather than to Ours. (3) Faisal in 'Iraq prepared parties of ^h-unmar and others against Us till 0 ur country was about to become a prey to thoir plunder. We protested and had a reply, but none of the guilty were punished by imprisonment, beating or warning and no robbed property was returned to its owners, Abdullah did the same thing in transJordan and there came the agreement of Bahra and Kad^a, but raids against Us never stopped, Neither did te find the British officials in 1 Iraq and transJordan so enthusiastic in defending U ur right to have the criminals punished as they were in their defence of 1 lra&lt;|, a defence which can only mean afgression of our country and homes. We, on Our part, have killed a number of Our subjects for the sake of ♦Iraq and have restored to the 1 Iraq Govern- merit part of the robbed property. Those whom *e were punishing ran away to f Iraq and where they were welcomed as the British officials saw and observed. (4) That passed, and then came the trouble over the infraction of the third clause of the Uqair Protocol, ^e protested and notified those in 1 Iraq of the consequent result^. They did not give our protest a listening ear,but delayed the reply too long so that one of Our subjects, M Boweish, started oomitting the acts that the Trans Jordan and 1 Iraq Arabs repeatedly comitted against Our Arabs right up to the time of .:d Doweish* s raids against ♦Iraq. We have restrained the people of Majd and compelled them to be patient and to hate the action of Bd Doweish who has beenha,;:- baen treated in the moat cruel manner and besieged from all direction#. The only action for punishing him .v'e u^layed is the sending: out of an expedition against him, to delayed carrying out that until we coulc come to an agreement to the effect that if a criminal rune away to f Iraq he will not be accepted there, (5) Affaire became quiet and calra, and then the British Goverm.ient threatened Ua that they will punish u ur subject® within Our frontiers. We explained to them the bad results Of eiuch action and that Wo ?/ere prepared to discuss the question of settling the difficulty by negotiation and that there was no need for -ueh action. ^he 1 Iraq Premier then declared that he wished to cause an expedition to advance against Hajd, but We gave no heed to his state aent, confident that as all those in 'Iraq well know, an advance towards i4ajd will only result in the same way as the action of the Turks when they advanced with the people of 1 Iraq and their Arabs, D&amp;ammar, Ibn Baahid and Syrian and Palestinian troops; and ilajd was surrounded from all sides, from the Persian Gulf, f Iraq, HiJaz and lexaen. The said expec ition returned by thci grace of God and with His help, fe do not think the officials in 1 Iraq will take such risks, (6) We hoard on the 9th Shaaban that aeroplanes dropped proclamations onOur frontiers warning Our subjects to withdraw four days distance from the frontiers as aeroplanes would drop bombs in that area, (?) On the 11th ihaaban wo heard that aeroplanes had dropped bombs on Our soil and on Our frontiers on calm and peaceful subjects, thus carrying out the wishes ox those in 'Iraq, satisfying their thirst for rancour and wreaking the revenge in their hearts againot innocent and peaceful people, Buch actionuch action brought about (l) aggreeeion against Our independence, (2) injury of peaceful tmd quiet people, (3) the li/htinr the fire of disturbance imew in Bajd, and, (4) caused the friend of Britain who isi trying to leceen difficulties and who is working for peace and calisness in thtf ArcMiian l eninsulrr to be placed in a falne position in the eyes of l is nation and people. The people of liajd, after such actions, began to ha ^e doubts about lis, that v ^e are (•eceivinfj them, while We are only one of them and sharer 05 their ,Joyo and sorrows. Can such resultn be considered satisfactory by our friend the British Gorermient for the sake of the hatred of Faisal ano Abdullah in * Iraq and TransJordan ? r er© fe not desirous not to ir^pair the British Government* s political procedure. We would hate actually shown them the standing of those two men among the A^fabs, Let the British Government closs their eyes a little and thej will see how the face of the Arab countries will alter after a short time. We do not wish to be exalted or to act unjustly, but We require Our religion and honour to be safe in Our country, J?or the insult which has befallen Us and the &amp;ajd people through the latest action of the British officials in 'Iraq, that disgraceful fund reprehensible action, was the greatest blow to the friendly relations between liajd and Britain, The insult that befell the Majd people through this, te are unable to induce them to keep silent on. The responsibility for the great incidents which hare occurred and will occur must rest on the 'Iraq Government and the British officials who helped to stirrinr such disturbances and who , We can only presume, became allies of the Sheriff against Us. (8) Another matter which has increased the fears of the Hajd people and their doubts too, is the fact that they heardheard that the British officials in Transjordan havo hegun to build a military post at liudawara station, A» is known to the British Gorernmsnt there are none but Kejdis around I^idawara which is situated on the bound ax i$ s upon which agreement has not yet 'been reached. -uch action has been interpreted in liajd as if the 1 Iraq and Trans j or can C-overniaentB consider i^ajd as an enemy against whom they m\|8t fortify themesIres hy building posts around him to surround him. This heinf; the case We must in these circumstances strongly protest against the following:- (1) The erection of builf int a and posts on the 'Iraq frontiers, the action which is contradictory to the third clause of the Uqair Protocol. (2) the mixing of 1 Iraq officials with some of Our Arab3 to incite thorn to rebel against Us which is contradictory to the texts of the iiahra agreement. (3) The crossing of Our frontiers by aeroplanes and dropping or warnings over Our Arabs. (4) The attacking by aeroplanes of peaceful people of Our subjects in Our territories which no international law agrees to, and for which there is no reason or necessity. (5) The building of the post at Mudawara station upon which agreement has not yet been conluded. .e would think that the friendship and mutual interests between Us and the British Government require thiit His Uajesty 1 a Government should reconsider the policy they have lollowed with the Oherifs which has produced such douots in ha jd and riven rise to such a very difiicult situation the issuits of ^mioh ; 7e cannot estimate and the responsibility for which, we con iider, should rest on those who caused it, to theBritisii Gov^xmient will carefully consider Our protest and v/ork oa their part to get their friend out of the critical position at which he has arrived, that they will cause the procedure or their official© who have followed thoae SherifB to be altered, to bring on them together with those who are in 1 Iraq the reeponeibility for the results of their actions and to pull out the seeds of the daggero which threaten the friendly relatione between Our two friendly countries, as in this lies advantage for Britain and &amp;a&lt;}d # this we wish Bis excellency the Agent and Consul to convey to the hritish Government au soon as possible and to let Us know their reply, fith best respects.

MR AMfSRY: There have been no further Wahabi raids since that of the 19th February, of which details were given in my reply to the hon. and gallant Member for Warwick and Leamington (Captain Eden) on the 27th February last.

MR AMERY; I have nothing to add to the reply given to the hon, and gallant Member for Hull, Central (Lieut.Com mander Kenworthy) on the 8th of March. I should like to take the opportunity to correct a statement that has appeared in the Press to the effect that troops have been sent from India to Kowcit in connection with the difficulties with the Akhwan, There is not a word of truth in the statement. I would add that I have no official confirmation of the report that King I-bn 3aud has declared a w Holy War' or has identi fied himself in any way with such a movement. CAPTAIN EDEK: Has the attention of the right hon. Gentleman been drawn to the sensational reports which have appeared in some newspapers ? May we regard them as unduly alarmist ? MR AMERY; Yes. I think you may. LIEUT.-CCMMANDER KKHWORTHY; Has the right hon. Gentleman any means of contact with Ibn Saud, or any means of communi cation with him, directly ? MR AMERY: Yes, Sir. We communicate either through the British Resident in the Persian Gulf or the British Agent at Jeddah or through Ibn Saud^ agent in Cairo; but the communication is not always very rapid. LIEUT.-COMMANDER KENWORTHY: Will the right hon. Gentleman consider sending a representative to the Court of Ibn Saud ?

MR DAY asked the Secretary of State for the Colonies whether any effort is being made by the representa tives of the British Governinent to get into contact with Ibn Saud for the purpose of discussion of the present situa tion in Arabia ? MR AMURY: Yes, Sir, as I informed the House on the 12th of March, His Majesty^ Goverment have, on more than one occasion, suggested to King Ibn Saud that a meeting should take place between himself and the Resident in the Persian Gulf# As, however, the King has not seen his way to adopt this suggestion, His Majesty's Goverrment have now offered to send out Sir Gilbert Clayton as a special envoy to discuss matters with His Majesty, with a view to clearing up the whole situation. MR DAY: Has any reply been received ? MR AMERY; No; if I had received a reply, I should have been glad to communicate it.

Although these documents set out in full the circumstances leading up to the present situation it might be of adrantsge to furnish you with a brief account of the principal events which haw. led to the present crisis tn the relations between His Majesty's aovernment and the King of Kejd. 4. in iieptember of last year King Ibn Saud adore aBed to the High Commissioner for Iraq a nrotest acainst the establishment by the Iraq Government of certain advaneed poliee poets. She post to which His Majesty took principal exception was one at Husaiyah, then in course of construction, which provided accommodation for some poll cepoll ce# Xh© post wa» situated at &amp; distanoe of some 75 miles from the nearest point on the Iraa-Mejd frontier# In his letter His Majesty represented that the construction of this post was contrary to the provisions of Article 3 of the Oqair FrotocoX of the 2nd of December,19^^ f which reads as follows • *fhe two aov^rrmients ismtually agree not to use the watering places and wells situated in the vicinity of the border lor any military purpose, such as building forts on taem, and not to concentrate troons in their vicinity 1 ** Some three weeks later King Ibn Saud followed up this letter with a further protest. At this point it should be explained that the construction of the Busaiyah post find similar police posts at other places equally far distant from the frontier was undertaken by the Iran Government in response to a previous complaint by King Ibn ttmd that the Government were remitting the refugee Shss^aar tribe to raid into Mejd territory through the narrow corridor connect! rig Iraq and !£r an®- Jordan# The Iraq Government heped %p $h@ establishment of these advanced police? posts to obtain early information of such raids and thus, even if unable to prevent them occurring at least to intercept the raiders on their return and inflict salutary mnishraent# ■ 5, In the latter part of Oototoer th« iU0i Commissioner replied to King Ibn Saufi pointing out that there was no foundation for the charge that the entabliehwent of the Busaiyah post was a contravention of the Uqair Protocol and sending photographs and details of the post to demonstrate that, quite apart from the fact that it could not be described as w in the vicinity of the border* (it is, in fact, the same distance from the feejd frontier as the fortified post at Butbah on the Xrans-desert air and motor route),route), itfe small aisie and limited garrison rendered any any desoription of it aa w a :fort w misleading# On HoTemtoer &amp;th, while this correspondence was in progress, a party ol Mutair raided the Busaiyah poet and slaughtered its occupants including in addition to the garrison ol 6 police an Irrigation official, 12 coolie© rmd an Iraqi woman* After this raid there followed in quick uuccesslon a number of further raida by Mutair tribesmen upon Iraq tribes. These raids were characterised by the utmost saTagerjr# Strongly worded protests were sent to King ihn Saud f hut the»e produced equivocal, replies, which, while admitting that in carrying out these raids the leader of the -'utair, -uhailch Faisal al liawish, had acted in defiance of His Majesty 1 » instructions, represented that the fault really lay with the irat ClOTemment in constructing the police post and that 1 a the police post were abandoned the raide would cease. It became increasingly obvious that the utair tribe had definitely thrown off Kim Saudt® authority and were no longer unuer his effective control; and this view was apparently substantiated by a warning which His Majesty conveyed to the Uesicient in the Per si en Gulf to the effect that a large force of Atewan were marching north contrary to hi® orders* In theBe oircumstanettS» His Majesty' a Govemtient decided that there could no long@3? be any objecticn to the Eoyal Air Force in Xra&lt;| being authorised to pursue Akh^an raiders across the border in order to inflict, if possible,- a lasting let son on them, fhis deci eion was communicated to lling Xbn Saud* In the meantime, these con stunt A5chv?en raids had had the effect of seriously unsettling the irm tribe of Anisseh one of the most powerful tribal confederations in Iraq. Towards the end of December the HighCoramiagioner reported that unless effective measures were taken to prereat further raids and to restore the oonfl dence of this tribe, there was a serious danger that they would desert Iraq and join the Akhwan. He explained that, owing to the liamense stretch of frontier and the great distance involved it was almost impossible for British aircraft to catch the raiders redhanded and to inflict mmishrnent upon them within Iraq territory and he suggested that, unless within a specified period King Ibn Saud demonstrated his willingness and ability to punish the raiders, a blockade of the Hasa Forts should be imposed in order to brin^ pressure to bear on the Akhwan . His Majesty's Gove rumen t were, however, unwilling to adopt bo serious a step, in any case until more direct action against the guilty tribesmen had been tried arid proved unsuccessful. After full consiceration they decided that, in the first instance, it would be preferable to extend air action beyond the Iraq frontier in order to deny an area of gracing grounds to the Akhwan- Early in January and after the laps© of some 2 months since the initial raid had taken place during which further raids had occurred and King Ibn Saud had taken no effective measures to restrain his recalcitrant subjects the a^tho ity for the adoption of this neasure was given and iiing Ibn Saud was notified accordingly. Advance aircraft and armoured car bases were pushed forward to the vicinity of the frontier and notices were dropped warning tribes to move out of the area which was to be deni -ied to the Akhwan* This action coupled with cons tan i air reconnaissances ^a© sufficient to restore the confidence of the Iraqi tribes, and for mme three weeks the raiding activities on the part of the Mutair were suspendedsu»p8 ,d«d. At the and of January, howevar, further raida occurred eulminating in a raid upon Iraq and Kowei t tribeanon by some 2,000 of the AJchwan who penetrated to a depth of amna 66 silee. She raiders were attaalced by British aircraft and are understood to have suffered se'ver® losses. i-ving i bn 3au4 had Iilth .erto endoaToured t-o exculpate himself and his tribes by the allegation that the Iraq OoTern-.ant had broken their Treaty pledges and * rfS ' 0 ® xeUBe i0 '*4lure to prwnt the raids and to admiai ster pubishment. He now represented that the oressing 04 his frontier by British aeroplanes was a Tielation ol his territory. These aeroplanes, he elleged, •jy bombing jjuilty and innocent alike had so outraged the feelings of hie people that he had had to abandon •leasures which he had already set in Motion for the control and punishment of the Mutair, his work of pacification had been destroyed and he could no longer control the feelings of hie people. A eonpUte answer to this allegation that innocent persons have been attacked by British, aircraft will be found in a telegram from Sir it. Kobbs dated the 19th of arch, of which a copy is attached. 8. £» response to this measag*. His uajesty'a (iOTernwent replied that in order to aBsist him to regain control ana provided that His Majesty would give asauranees that he would prevent further raids and would punish the offenders and exact full reparation, orders would be issued that no aircraft should cross the liejd frontier except in hot pursuit of raiders. At the same time. His Majesty's Oovernment repeated a suggestionsuggeeticm oremousXy made by them on several oocaelone that a meeting should fee arranged between Hie Majesty and the Bri ti eh He si dent in the Persian Oulf to discuss the Questions cl i s P^te« Hi® Majesty did not accept this invitation nor did he give the assurances for which His Majesty 1 s Govextment had asked, but merely reiterated his previous protests. Feanwfciie # rumours became current that all tae Akhwan were joining with the Mutair in a regular jihad {Holy War) against the aon-Alehwan States of Iraq, trans-Jordan md Koweit and that King Ibn Saud (himself powerless to prevent it) had been forced to associate himself /i th this movement. Later info nation, however, tends, to discredit these rumours, and to indicate that King Ibn Bend dis soeiates himself from the action of the more unruly elements of the Akhwan and has been, at least temporarily, successful in detaching the important tribe of At-ibi from, the movement against Iraq and Koweit# According to earlier rumours this tribe together with the Ajmen had decided to join with the Mutair in attacking Iraa, Trans- Jordan and Koweit# 9» throughout his letters King Ibn Baud has maintained, in the face of uncontrovertible evidt nee to th» contrary, that the establishaent of the liusaiyah poet Wd similar police posts is a contravention of the uc|/dr Protocol end has continued to nress for its abolition as providing the only solution of the present trouble. To this His Majesty has lately added a further condition, namely, that those responsible for bombirg his terrilay should be puni shed# As an example of the general ten our of King Ibn Gaud' s recent letters, X m to enclose a translation of a letter from His Kajesty dated the 8th of March. The cedents of the High Comissjoner for Iraq upon this letter will be found in his telegrsm 110.16$ of the 19th19th of March to whlcfo reference has hem made i^^&amp;rngr&amp;vh 7 above. XQm Mb MmJ osty* * Geremment are not prepared to admit that the iraQ Qorernment, in constructing thase posts, aotod othorwise than in full accord with their Treaty obligations; nor are th^y prepared to ag3r«e to the demolition of my of uheso posts. It sJiould bo wemlitG4 that Uie interest or Hi® Majesty 1 ® Government in th« maintenanco of theue posts Ooefe not arise solely out of their reftjwmsibility for the defence of Iraq. It is of the utmcst Importance for His llajeBty 1 » aovemnent to ensure the preservation of the authority of the Iraq (rovernment in the corriuor connecting Iraq and 'xrans-uoraan. If Akhwan influence were allowed to penetrate into this area, the projects of a pipe line and a railway from Haifa to Baghdad, to which His Majesty* s Government attach consider able impo^rtance, would become impracticable. The only apparent means of securing the maintenance of Iraq authority in this area is by a chain of poists such as those whi ch have been established by the ira&lt;| Government, rm&amp; to which King Ibn Baud takes such a strong exception. You will see, therefore, that .imperial as well as local issues are involved. Consequently, a solution on the lines proposed by Kl&amp;ir Ibn Baucl is unacceptable, and it remains to consider what other measures can be taken in order to provide' m satisfactory settlement of the matters in dispute and one which will offer good prospects of the cessation of further raiding and the establiehmnt of settled conditions on the Iraq-Hejd frontier. Doubtless a full and frank discussion of the questions in dispute between yourself and King ibn Baud will go far to convince Eis ajesty ( if indeed he is not already convinced) that his protests against the establishment of the Jmsaiyah post were unjustified and thatthat in this matt#r the action of the Iraq GoYernment has been correct, but # it any settlement which may be reached ia to be lasting, the question of King Ibn Sand's own position Tie a ris his tribes cannot be ignored. Ko settlement can be considered satisfactory which involTes any serious and apparent loss of prestige on his part end there fore tends to weaken his control over his subjects. In short, some arrangement should be arrired at, which, without involving any adndasi on of fault on the part of the Iraq Oovernnent or of His Majesty 's Government will serve to mitigate His Majesty 's difficulties* 11# fhe dispute, ostensibly at least, has arisen owing to a difference of interpretation of the words * in the vicinity of the border w in Article 3 of the Uqair Protocol. In the interests of both parties it is essential that some means should be found of removing the ambiguity in this phrase and thus eliminating the possibility of further dispute by the adoption of m accepted definition. It has been suggest#* that these words should be defined as meaning within a distance of (say) 2b miles from the frontier. Alternatively, it has been suggested that, instead of a definition based upon distance from the frontier the well© on each side of the frontier, the fortification of which Ib prohibited, should be specifically enumerated, the Iraq Government have agreed in principle to the latter suggestion, but consider that difficulties may arise owing to the lack of exhaustive information on the subject# Mr .Cawrallis will, however„ be furnished with a map showing the position of such wells as are known to exist. His Majesty's aovernroent consider that a definition on the basis of one or other of the above alternativesalternatives should, if possible, be adopted, but they are content to leave you t© deoide, in the light of your conversations with King Ibn Baud, and in consultation with r.Comwallis, the preoise terms of the definition to be adopted. 12. in a letter dated the 25th of January and addressed to His Majesty 1 s Agent and Consul at Jeddah, King Ibn »aud stated that, in deference to the stipulations of Article 3 of the Uqair Protocol he had forbidden his tribes to build a fortified post at Linah which is situated more than 30 miles from the Iraq frontier. It seems possible that, by encouraging His Majesty to exercise his undoubted right to construct a chain of Mejdi posts outside the prohibited sone on his side of the frontier the reciprocal nature of the arrangement would be made evident and any appearance of surrender on the part of His Majesty would be removed. With the same object in view the Iraq Government have suggested that His Majesty might be encouraged to co-operate with them in the establishment of a join post to be manned by Hejdi and Iraqi contingents in the neutral ssone. You will doubtless put forward these suggestions, if you consider them likely to be acceptable to King Ibn Baud, when a favourable opportunity occurs. In the unlikely event of King Ibn Baud proving wholly intractable and your failing to move him by argument, you may, if you see fit^indicate to him, in such manner as you may deem appropriate, that, unless some satisfactory settlement is reached which will ensure peaceful conditions on the frontiers of Iraq and Koweit, His Majesty's Government may be compelled to bring further pressure to bear upon the guilty tribes either directly'is # 5B • m tl. C T &lt; Cal* 0 •- ireotly or Indirectly through the medium of a blockade of the Persian Gulf Forte. In thin connection I am to enclose copies of telegrame from which it appear® that King lion Baud is fully alive to the latter posaiMlity and is anxious to avoid it. If it becomes evident that there can be no satisfactory outcome from your conversations with His Majesty and that their continuance would serve no usseful purpose, you should report accordingly to liis Majesty 1 s Government and await instructions, in the meantime suspending discussions* It i s not the wish of His Majesty's Government that the negotiation© should bo definitely broken off while there remains any prospect of a successful issue or without prior reference to London# l-% /».r. Oorm-'alXis wi IXbe in a position to furni sh you with details of the claims of the iracj Government to reparation for the recent ^khwan raids. You should endeavour to obtain from King ibn Baud an undertaking to satisfy these claim® after due investigation and indeed any settlement ^ith His Majesty which does not contain provision for theliquidation of these claims, and for the punishment of his guilty tribesmen would not be acceptable. 14. in a letter, a copy of which is enclosed, dated the 6th of December addressed to His Majesty 1 s High Commissioner for «gypt and presented by Shaikh Hafez Wahba, His Hajesty suggested that a special emissary should visit him to discuss certain matters of mutual concern to himself and the British Government. As you will see, the three questions in his opinion calling for discussion were - U) Italy's new position in Arabia {2} the position of the Shereefian rulers of Irac* and Trans-Jordan and (3) the position of Bolsheviks In Arabia and their conflict with British economic interests. Of these questions the second,, which really concerns the J17. the traditional hostility between King Ibn Baud and the present rulers of Iraq and Trans-Jordan, will doubtless be raised by King IbnSaud in the oourse of your discussions regarding the situation on the 1 raq-Kejd frontier. It is hoped that, with the information with which Mr. Comwallis will be able to furnish you, supplemented by the facts which will be supplied to you by the Trims-Jordan (Jovernnent, you will be in a position to reassure His Majesty that, whaterer my be the personal fee linger towards himself of King jTaisal tmd his brother the Amir Abdullah, such feelings are not allowed to effect in any degree the policy or actions of the aoremments of those two countries, Yis 4 Tis his own territories, 15• with regard to the first of the questions mentioned above, X mi to enclose for your information and guidance a copy of a despatch addressed by the Secretary of State for foreign Affairs to His Majesty 1 s Ambassador in Home* Unless King Ibn Saud himself raises the question of the position of Italy in the south west portion of Arabia you should not advert to the subject. If» however, the question is raised by Ha llajesty in the course of your discussions you should inform him that Hi© Majesty's Government are giving their sympathetic attention to the views which he has expressed and are considering the best mean® of allaying his anxieties. 16. As regards the third question mentioned in King Ibn gaud's letter I leave it to your discretion, if a suitable opportunity presents itself, yo point out to His Majesty the ill ef. ects upon the pilgrimage and consequently upon the i^xechequer if the Bolshevik activities in the Hejas are permitted to increase. You may assure His l ajesty that if he will take the matter Innhand His Majesty* s Government will bi glad to co-operate wiUi him by giving him all the infomatior that may reach them as to the presence of known Bolshevik agents or persons of pronounce** Bolshevik views proceeding t&lt; the IlejasR under the guise of pilgrims.17. AS you^are aware certain points raoied by Kini? Ibn Baud in the oaurao of/oonYersatIon b whioh you oonductad with him in the sutler of x9.'-7 in .ouneciien with the negotiation of the Treaty of Jeddsh were Xaft over for sutosequent settlement, and it is dessirable that you • sould know what action has been taken in regard to these matters by His Majesty's Oovem-ent in the interral. in pmrifigra ^h of your despatch of the 6th of June, 1537, you reported to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that King Ibn Saud had raised the question of the restoration of the Hejaa iailway. you then inforwed him that his Majesty's OOTemnent were di.cussir« the natter with the French Gorerrvnent: ais ajsaty asked to be kept iniomeu of the progress of the negotiations and said that he presumed that he would be giren the opportunity of nominating a representative to attend the oonferonee which would be held with a view to arranging a final settlonent. In .June last the French, Oovem- ent suggested that a conference of local experts should be held at Haifa but that the activities of the Conference should be limited to the discussion of tecf rical questions. In August His Majesty's Government informed the French Government that they agreed to their suggestions and expressed the hope that they would Join with Itts HajestyAa Govern-ient in informing King Ibn Saud accordingly and reoueoting hia to nominate a representative to attend the conference at Haifa. Xhough their attention was on several occasions called to the matter, the French Government did not signify their acceptance19 ♦ A copy in f4i«o an closod of &amp; d &lt;9 spat oil to ^^n-lS.XQ.gj ®»J a sty' s Acting Consul at ^ odd ah ©n tix« oubj eat of the Haramain Waff»« You will sea tliat His Majesty 1 a Govarament caanot give any generttl promise of aaoistance to King Ibn Saud in the matt ir of ^aramain -iaqf 8 f but that, subject to this reservation, they will, in thia matter as in others, alwaye be ready to consider sympathetically any request which he may make for as si stance or advice, For the reasons given in the despatch addressed to Mr* Jekins, His 'Majesty's Government are unable to comply with the specific Mng requests may by/ibn Saud to you, 20. In your despatch of the 9th of J une to the Secretary of State for foreign Affaire you reported that K-in^ ibn Saud entered into detail in regard to the particular case of the tribunals for the settlement of claims on account of raids, with special reference t© Tr^s- Jordan, and that Hi a majesty had said that, as regards past raiae, he would be willing to accept the award of an arbiter, provided that a selected British officer was appointed. Hi® Majesty also suggested, to facilitate speedy settlement in the future, the appoiateent of a British officer, experienced in Arab habits and customs, whose duty it would be to keep a constant watch aver tribal affairs and who would be the recipient of all details and information regarding raids as and when taey took place. 21» in September last His itaj esty was informed that Mis Majesty* s Government accepted his proposal for the appointment of a British officer to keep constant watch over tribal affairs on the i« a j d-t r an s - Jo r dan frontier and that t riay proposed that this officer should act as arbitrator in disputes arising from past raids. His Majesty^ Government proposed to entrust those duties toto Mr. A.3. Kirkbride, the Mir at Assistant to the British B@ aidant in Trans •Jordan. King I*bn Baud agreed to aceopt tks bindings of a British arbitrator but he made it clear that he would not agree to tue appointment of aay person connected \?ith tne Oovomments oi Palestine -rami-Jordan or Iraq, either as an arbitrator on claims arising out of past raids or as the recipient of details and information regarding future raids, af$er furtner consideration His I 'ajesty 1 a Govornmont decided in Jacenbar last (l) to inform king ibn liaud tiu ^t # if ho agreed that on$ half the cost of the s^pjintmant »ould be borne by tha Government of Majd, tney would forthwith appoint as arbitrator on claims arising out of p ^st raids an officer unconnected with the ^orernments of Palestine, Tr- ns-Jordan or Iraq and i2) to suggest to His Majeaty tliat he should discuss with the officer so appointed the best mean s of providing machinery for the settlement of any future disputes, &gt;ie iiis Majesty was then on the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf and as it seamed desirable tnat the matter should be discussed with him orally it was decided to defer further negotia tions until he returned to Jeddah. 22. His Majesty has now reopened the question. You should inform him that His l ajesty 's GoTsrnmont are pre pared to appoint a British Officer to arbitrate upon claims arising out of past raids between Trans -Jordan and Kejd and that they undertake to select for this appoint ment an officer mo has no connection with the adminis trations of Palestine, trans-Jordan or iraq, ^ou should fc.lso inform His I. aj esty that in the view of His Majesty 's G ot iromesit this officer mould adjudicate upon claims in respect of raids as far b &amp;eJc as the date of the occupation of Jauf by king ibn Baud's forces in July 1921 and that all claims, whether made by Trans-Jordan against HejdHejd or by Bejd against Trans-Jordan, should be dealt with by him» If Flag Ibn Baud agreoe tc tJbiese x&gt;roposals # His Majesty*® Creyemmsnt will appoint ' n officer to arbitrate upon the claiias as soon as po^'sibl 23* As regards the proposal that an officer should be appointed to deal with future disputes, there are practical difficulties in adopting this su ^eetion since that officer would owe allegiance to no local authority and could have no reiy clear or definite status, A further consideration is that it is mont unliiccly that the duties of receiving infomation about, and dealing with, tribal questions on the Uejd-trans-Jordan frontier would occupy the full time and services of an officer. You should therefore explain to &amp;ini£ ibn 3aud the difficulties which lie in the way of the appointment of a whole time officer for this purpose, 24. failing the use of the tribunals provided for in the Hadda Agreement the alternatives appear to be (1) the appointment of a special arbitrator as and when need arises or (2) the appointment 'by the Government s of Trans-Jordan and Mejd offrontier Officers l&gt;cm both sides, who would meet fro® time to tine and deal on the spot with such difficulties as my arise on the frontier. If the latter alternative were adopted it might be desirable, having regard to trie possibility of a complete deadlock between the two frontier officers, to provide that, failing settlement by them, any matter in dispute should be referred t© a British officer unconnected with a.iy of the local administrations. His l.ajesty*8 (*o/ernment are content to leave it to you to decide il) how far if at all. King Xbn Baud should be pressed to a^ree that future disputes and claims should be brought beiore taa tribunals provided tor in the Hadda- Agreement andand (2) failing sgreement on this point, i«fcioh of the alternative arrangements mentioned alsove should be adopted. 25, I m. to inform you that in accordimce with your suggestion, the Palestine GoTernr ^nt hare agreed to place at your disposal the services of i r» G .Antonius, , both to assist you generally in the negotiations and to advise in regard to all matters connected with Trans-Jordan, He will be fully documented in regard to recent raids and claims for reparation,and will be fully acquainted with tribal questions and the situation on the Trans-Jordan frontier.

THOMAS asked the Secretary of State for the Colonies whether he is aware that the origin of the recent trouble in Arabia is traceable to the action of the Iraa GoTemment in building a fort at the desert wells of Busaiyah; and why, in view of Article 3 of the Protocol of Uqair, the Iraq Government took this step? MR. AMSRY; I am aware that King Ibn Saud has protested against the building of a post at Busaiyah, which was merely an intelligence post armed by 13 police, and not a fort, but I am satisfied that the action of the Iraq Government in this matter has been perfectly correct and that the construction of this post in no way infringed the provisions of Article 3 of the Uqair Protocol, That Article prohibits the fortification of wells ^in the vicinity of the border**. The post in question is situated no less than 75 miles from the Iraq-Nejd frontier, and consequently does not fall within the provisions of this Article. The establish ment of this post and of similar small police posts at other places equally remote from the frontier was, in fact, originally undertaken by the Iraq Government as a consequence of complaints by King Ibn Saud that a section of the Shammar tribe, recently settled in Syria, was being permitted to raid into Nejd territory through the narrow corridor connecting Iraq and Trans-Jordan. The Iraq Government hoped, by the establishment of these police posts, to place themselves in a position to control the tribesmen and to deal effectively with any attemptedattempted raids f and in fact there have been no Shammar raids into Nejd since the establishment of tnese posts, I may further remind the hon. Member that the present trouble originated with a wanton attack on Busaiyah by Akhwan tribesmen, who massacred its occupants.1/14. Telegram p. From To Repeated UnnurnlDered.

I think it is a good thing that this last section of Armoured Oars is leaving Kuwait now, as there is little or no fear of any further trouble from the Ikhwan for the next few months* There is no doubt whatever that the Shaikh and the great majority of the people of Kuwait are really grateful for the protection which we have given them* A theory, apparently started by some 'politicians' in 'Iraq, that we never voluntarily leave a place we go to, and that our coming to Kuwait in the guise of protectors would cer tainly mean that we would take it over, found few supporters j. in Kuwait itself; and it would indeed be a pity if ideas of this sort were to gain credence through our stopping on too long* I shall be very much interested to hear whether this move means that some satisfactory news has been re ceived regarding the Jiddah Conference. Personally I shall be extremely surprised if an agreement is arrived at ~ and still more if it is kept - unless we are prepared to give Ibn Sa f ud a subsidy. The fact that Ibn Humaid and Dawish refused to meet him in Buraidah shows that he has still no • / real authority over them, and I think he is too honest a man to agree to terms* the fulfilment of which he knows he cannot enforce* In my opinion the most economical policy would be to give him a subsidy, by means of which he might regain Jregain his lost authority over the tribes. It woW tfot' :.ieed to be very large, or permanent, and would certainly De cheaper than continued Frontier operations similar to those of the last few months.. Still. I hardly think this Is a policy likely ttO appeal to His Majesty's Government* It is difficult to foretell what will happen if the 'Tiddah Conference does break down; Ibn Sa'ud will certainly avoid an open breach with us if ho possibly can.- I have heard a suggestion from Arab - or rather, from f Ira&lt;^ - sources that he will probably try intrisuing with some other European power, but I doubt if there is anything in that e As we are not likely to take any unprovoked action, it seems probable that, if no agreement is arrived at, or if Ibn Sa 'ud agrees to termg which he cannot enforce, the desert will remain quiet until the autumn, and that raids similar to those of the past spring will start again then» I consider any renewal of raiding in the near future improbable, not only because of the difficulty of noving large parties when grazing and water is scarce, but because the grazing is so bad further south that it is of vital importance to the Mutair that they be allowed to remain in peace round Hafar, etc., for the next month or two, and it would be easy I for us to or event this if active operations were in progress* i The Shaikh of Kuwait is certainly not optimistic about the future. Hot only is he very anxious to get the Machine Guns and Lewis Guns referred to in my telegram Ho* &gt;56 of 17th May, but he is strengthening the town wall, and has t/rz lust completed one new tower it, which I understand Is only the .first of several.

From this note it will 'be seen that from the first Ihn Saud was against the 'boundary idea and that he only gave way 'because of his feelings for Oir Percy Cox, the man to whom he owed so much. This would go far to explain the present situation. What I on aaud did for Sir Percy Oox ^as on personal grounds. low his original and fixed ideas have become his driving force and he has reverted to the position which he gave up only through his feeling for Sir Percy Cox. The points at issue for us are then how far rs I bn Saud f s demands % reasonable #« i « l ft*om a trihal point of view; are they possible from a modern Government point of view and if not what modus vivendi is possible. Copies of this despatch are being sent to the Government of India and to His Excellency the High Oommissioner for 'Iraq.. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant* Lieut-Col., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. JV A j ~ &gt; P.IU ITote on Bin Saud f s attitude at the it Oquair H meeting with Sir Percy Cox in Noveiriber 1922 with special regard to the question of M w ellE M existing along the proposed Nejd-Iraq Boundary . As ordeiWlDy you-1 'beg to suhmit the following note whicl I give from my memory# I was sent down to Bahrain in September 1922 from Baghdad with special instructions from the High Commissioner to get into touch with Bin Saud and persuade him to come down to the coast, with a riew to his meeting the High Commisioner. The special point for discussion and if possible for settlement was to be the Iraq-Nejd Boundary* During the preyious spring a series of raids by Nejd tribes into Iraq, territory, and an equal number of counter raids by Shammar sections, who had not accepted Bin Saud's over-lordship, and had taken refuge in the Hillah Liwa had, brought the need for some sort of 'Modus VIYMDI' 1 to the for a The first raid, counter raids, and subsequent political propaganda in Iraq were almost identical in form and method jc with what we have recently seen in the Autumn and Winter of 1927-1928* Few people realized especially certain officials in Iraq that the state of affairs was nothing new. It was only a Repetition of what had IrertKg been going on for years under th« Turkish regime, the only new item being the introduction of the word 'Akhwan'• Behind all these events Iraq Officials I think failed to recoginize the 'economic question'. This and this alone is th€ root cau-^se in my opinion of the annual clash tkat has taken place each year for the last centu^ry ^long the Southern Euphrates and has teday made willing tools of the Desert tribes in the hands of Bin Saud on the one side, and the Faisalite politicians ©n the other. It is a well known fact that the Northern and Nort-East- ern Bedouin tribes of Nejd and specially the Ajman,lfiBLtxi* Mutair, Shammar, and nearer heme the Dkafir cannot support jj 2 ^ | themselres in their own country and must, of a necessity I migrate each year during the Winter month towards the | Euphrates in order to obtain certain necessities of life. These come under three main heads, (a) To purchase dates (b) To purchase rice (c) To find grazing for their camels along the rich Zone lying South of the Euphrates from Kerbala to Zobeir. The above also applies to the Anaze tribe (Amarat) in I the North, but because of the fact that their Shaikhs own j land round Kerbala and they consider themselves an Iraq tribe no serious clash between the Reverain tribes and them selves has ever taken place. The routes and tribal sectors of the Euphrates tapped by I the Shammar, Ajman, Mutair and Dhafir in their annual market- j | ing migration have been from time immemorial as follows:- (1) Shammar more up towards Shinafiyah and Samawah. (2) The Dhafir towards Hasriyah and Suq esh Shuijukh. (3) Mutair towards Khamisyeh / Ratawi on the Hamar Lake. (4) The Ajman towards Zubair and Kuwait. i Note .The Anaze similarly come injto market on the line Kerbala -Nejaf and tap the Shamiyeh area. The methods adopted have always been to send presents in to the powerful Riverain tribes ( and to the Saadun Shaikhs when the latter were strong) to ask permission to come up j and camp near the river (usually this was about 20 miles i | away) where well water was good. From these camps they would 'Sabil' in one continuous stream up to the towns and tribal villages along the Euphrates and make their purchases. Both i 'D asoniT sides benefitted. The aeret man brought money and camels while his Euphrates counterpart got rid of his surplus dates and rice, and incidentally renewed his supplies of rifles and ammunition. (a To deny the Bedouin permission to pass the Euphrates was considered tantamount to a declaration of war and trouble^resulted. This win always be whether these tribes ^Tunder Bin Sauces control or not. The point here to .remember is that while the Euphrates towns and tribes merely welcomed the annual appearance of these Bedouin from the interior of Arabia, it is and has been an absolute necessity: for the latter to 'Sabil' up to j Iraq and necessity knows no law or boundry line, j The above observations are made from eight ^ntinuous jPolitical experience of the Muntafiq and Hillah Liwas, in jhoth of which areas I was in chief Political Charge and I am | of opinion that if a policy of welcoming the desert tribes | of Bin Saud annually up to the Euphrates were adopted, | instead of treating them with restrictive enactments and kem | measures which they don't understand, the desert raid trouble | woulc soon cease. The nwnad resents fiercely any attempt to restrict hie free movement in the desert and maps and boundaries fixed by Governiaents caases nothing for. i To my mind a political IwS? was made when a fixed bound- | ary was decided on and movments of Hejd tribes towards Iraq | were definitely restricted. A better solution I think would i have be 7Jl h p^l fij, xedup a broad r 5 ltral Zon e of say 100 ;miles wide A to Jebel Anaiza, the Northern edge of the Zone conforming icughly to the line of the Euphrates, but 80 miles oouth of it, and the Zone similarly extending round Kuwait ; territory to about where the present boundary touches the sea | I mention the above details at length as zXl the OJair i Oonference mentioned at the begining of this note,and which I was successfully brought about. Bin Saud's contention rather | followed this way of thinking. At ihe said Qonference which was attended by Bin Saud, oir Percy Cox, Shaikh Pahad Beg of the Anaze (Amarat), the Minister of Public Works (for Iraq) and Abdul Latif Pasha al Mendil of Basra (un-official adviser to Bin Saud) # Bin Saud jstarted off by insisting that the Dhafir was his tribe ; and I that and that his boundary should go right up to the Euphrates |not because he wished to control that river, but because his big bedouin tribes actually moved up annually to the Euphrates ^ J/1 S &lt;X40(.A^X\A\ AJ^vC. £r^?xJic*e&lt;i y&amp;-Tjr n r\* 4. and v/ould never be denied tiie righ.'t whicli was a question of life and aeath for them. ^Then it was pointed out by Sir Percy Cox that this claim was a ridiculous one and could'nt be discussed^ Bin Saud gave in over the T)hafir ; and adopted the more reasonable line that the line of tribal ,l, ' l,|1&gt;|11 in il 'imi! ■ . / c wells should form the boundary, as everyone was aware of these, and each tribe from the days of Abraham knew exactly which was its well and which was not. That is to say he advocated that the Southern^most wells claimed by the Anaze, Dhafir and Kuwait tribes should form the boundary, while any ■ wells known to be common property (such existed between Anaze and Dhafir, and between Dhafir and Nejd tribes) were to be declared neutral. When asked how the claims to these wells were to be pioved ( -bin ^aud retorted that the Desert ^vorld knew them as clearly as the light of day, and moreover tribal 'wosems' or marks, existed on every one of them, and in the unli£k41y i event of a dispute arising in the matter, the ' Ahl el Khibra ' or wise men Y /ith knowledge, could put the matter right. In any case. Bin Saud maintained the right of Nejd tribes to go up to the Euphrates to make their annual purchases. The Iraq representative Subhi Beg^when asked his views, on a proper frontier declared for a £ijke at least 200 miles South of the Euphrates, and insisted that Iraq would accept nothing else# Sir Percy Cox attempted the'via Media' but could not get Bin Saud to budge an inch from his 'tribal well' idea* Eventually at a final meeting at which only Sir Percy Cox, Bin Saud, Major More and myself were presen^Sir Percy Cox lost his temper at whioh he called the childish attitude of Bin Saud and we had the astonishing sight, of Bin Saud being ^Rtold off' like a naughty School Boy by the High Commissioner. This ended the discussion. Bin Saud almost broke down and pathetically remarked that Sir Percy Cox was his father and mother who had made him and raised him to what ever position he held, and that he v/ould surrender half his J!—— • A j^. \ kingdom nay the whole if he, Sir Percy ordered. 1 b2-feg6e-iii&amp; 3 1.

The chief demands which the Ikhwan put forward were:(a) the abolition of Wireless, telegraphs and telephones throughout his dominions; (b) the abolition of A the duty levied by him on supplies purchased by the tribes at all ports : - as distinct from the ordinary Oustoms Import Duty; and (c) L the demolition of Busaiyah and other Frontier posts. Although some of these were impossible of acceptance, he hoped to be able to compromise with them olper others - for example, he hoped to be able to persuade us to demolish the posts. What pleased him most, however, was that he succeed - ' ed in showing up Dawfih in his true colours to Ibn Humaid,and &lt; conveying to him some idea^ of what an arrogant and self- willed man he really is - thereby sowing the seed of discord between the two shaildis, which he hopes will germinate during the three months truce which has been arranged. Certain it is that the relations between Ibn Humaid ^ and Dawish were not so cordial at the end of the negotiations as they had been before. Moreover, it is said in Qasfm that Dawfsh's influence even over his own tribe is on the wane,and that an unobtrusive, but gradual, exodus from Artawfyah itself is beginning2^' is beginning to take place (In this connection see my memo randum No. 3 13~S dated the 29th May 1928). Some go so far as to think that Daw£sh will soon cease to be an important political factor in Arabia, and even to predict that some 'misadventure' will happen to him before long. The above is what is said in Buraidah.

I HAVE the honour to transmit, with reference to my telegram No. 61 of the 1st instant, a translation of Dr. Damluji's letter protesting against the language used by the Iraq Minister for Defence in a recent statement in Parliament. 2. The Minister for Foreign Affairs came to see me on the 1st instant to discuss this letter. I told him that I could not help feeling that the Hejaz Government were taking a most exaggerated view of the importance of Noori Pasha's statement. How could he, Damluji, possibly pretend to believe that an Iraq Minister could get up in the Iraq Parliament and make a statement representing His Majesty's Government's views ? Moreover, I gathered from newspaper reports which I had seen that his speech was not intended as a statement of Iraq policy. He was merely concerned with justifying to Parliament the expenditure voted for his Ministry. 1 pointed out to Dr. Damluji that, having no Parliament and being answerable to nobody, the Hejaz Government had the almost unique advantage of being able to spend what they liked on defence without their expenditure or their deliberations being known to the public. If he, however, were Defence Minister and answerable to a Hejaz Parliament, did he really think he could justify expenditure this year without referring in his statement to Iraq-Nejd relations ? I agreed with him that Noori Pasha's statement was unfortunate at this juncture, but I failed to agree that it was provocative either in fact or in intention. As the King had no other means of communicating with His Majesty's Government or with Iraq, I had no choice but to despatch on His Majesty s behalf telegrams embodying the protest, bat I was loth to do so as I was convinced that His Majesty's Government would feel that a very exaggerated view was being taken of the importance of the offending statement. 3. I had the impression that Dr. Damluji secretly agreed with me. Yussuf Yassin was, however, present at the interview, and the King was evidently worked up. Damluji consequently pressed me to telegraph to you asking for assurances from His Majesty's Government and Iraq that Noori Pasha did not express the views of either Government, as, if such assurances were not forthcoming, the Hejaz Government would find it difficult, in face of the general resentment aroused, to feel themselves bound by the verbal agreement recently made between the King and Sir Gilbert Clayton. , t tt- tvt • » 4.

Dr. Damluji to Consul Stonehewer-Bird. (Translation.) T 7 _ 7 oo- -w oo (After Compliments.) Jeddah, June -w , iJ^o. I HAVE the honour to inform your Excellency that I read in the newspapers the declarations made in the Iraq Parliament during the course of the discussions on the budget of his Ministry by Noori Pasha Essaid, formerly Minister for Defence in the Iraq Government. He said that the funds allotted by Royal decree to the Ministry for Defence were for the purposes of defence of the Iraq frontiers against the Nejd people and for paying allowances to Sheikh Mahruth-el-Hazal. He added that, although these funds had not been spent, it was expected that it would be necessary to spend them at the end of the present summer. • -n i Your Excellency will doubtless realise that the statements of Noon Pasha, it tHey express the views of the Iraq Government, do not give evidence of good intentions on [511 z—2]2 the part of the Iraq Government. They indicate rather evil intentions, despite the mutual peaceful endeavours exerted in a friendly and amicable spirit during the Jeddah negotiations for settling the questions in dispute. What can be the value of the peaceful negotiations and international treaties if bad intentions govern the minds of those who are responsible for the upholding^ of international treaties and maintaining amicable relations between neighbouring countries ? In view of the hostile spirit and desire for separation with which these declarations are full, my Government must strongly protest against Noori Pasha and the Iraq Government, and request from your Excellency to inform us of the real intentions of the Iraq Government. If her intentions are as declared by Noori Pashd, in the name of his Government, it is a matter to be strongly regretted, as peaceful endeavours will be in vain and the good wealth be wasted. If no official denial of these declarations is made and no definite assurance given to my Government to the effect that what was said by Noori Pasha does not represent the real views of the Iraq Government and the friendly British Government, my Government will be obliged to say that it will be very difficult to be bound by the temporary agreement concluded between His Majesty my Lord the King and General Clayton. I await your Excellency's reply in this connexion. With respects, ABDULLAH DAMLUJI, Minister for Foreign Affairs. oTeleprrara . (P) t From: Political Agent, To: Resident Persian Gulf, Shiraz.

I have Just received intimation from Messrs. the Meso potamia Persia Corporation, Ltd.&gt; Kuwait, that 'ss.'Baroda' from Basrah is due to arrive here at 11 a.nu to-morrow (Sunday) with 35 drums Benzol and 5 packages stores account R#A t P. ff , When the R.A.F. were here a considerable amount of their petrol and stores used to 'be shipped from Basrah by the B»I» steamers, and when they left they they arranged with the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation to ship their sur plus petrol back to Basrah by a steamer which was arriving that day. As a matter of fact the steamer refused to carry the majority of this owing to the tins not being in good; condition. I was much surprised, therefore, when I heard of the arrival of some more R.A^F, petrol by the last steamer; and was told on inquiring from the Mesopotamia Persia Corpora- - 1 tion that they had been asked to store it in their ware houses with that which they already held. I assumed that the consignment which arrived by last steamer had been shipped by mistake, and that whoever was concerned had forgotten to cancel a standing order when the R.A»F. were withdrawn from Kuwait. In view of this new con- signment, however, this can hardly be the case, and it looks as if the R.A.F. are forming a dump in Kuwait for use when, or if, they have to come here again. JIt this be the case, I do not know whether the Eeoident has 'been consulted; but, if not, I think he certainly ought to know, as, however convenient it may be to have a dump here it is open to doubt whether it is politically sound# It has already given rise to the rumour that the R,A»F. are coming back to Kuwait shortly, which seems a great pity, as personally I consider it most undesirable that the idea should get about that we will at once occupy Kuwait, as if it were a part of 'Iraq, If any trouble occur on the 'Iraq - Najd ^rentier* Lt*-Col.j Political Agent, Kuwait.

The Sunni, in Iraq^ are generally better educated than the Shias and therefore form the governing classes; they come between the Akwan and the Shias in their observance of religion and are disliked by both.All three from the religious point of view dislike each other and religious fanaticism is a powerful cause of strife among arabs. The tribes friendly to us in the south-west of Iraq have to send their flocks and herds into the desert for grazing* The desert tribes have a natural desire to raid and rob anyone better off than themselves; they have political reasons for disliking the British and a variety of reasons for disliking the people of Iraq» We, as the Mandatory Power, have the problem not only of protecting Iraq from big raids but the shepherds and flocks etc of the friendly tribes when sent into the desert to graze. These flocks get very scattered and are most difficult to protect; if they are raided when out in the desert we have to take immediate punitive action although of course our first wish is to protect them from being raided, Ibn Saud (if honest) wishes to keep his people (who cover an enormous area) at peace with us but on account of the attraction of raiding his people unfortunately have every opportunity of getting into a state of war with us. The Basis of Ibn Saud's original and very great power over his people was spiritual. Religion plays the first part in the lives of arabs. The Akwan while worshipping Allah pay little attention to Mahomet because Mahomet is dead and with them the dead prophet is of less importance than the Living Descendant of the prophet; Ibn Saud is a descendant of the SxkShKiK prophet and hence his power. He is however losing much of this spiritual power because he has committed the heresy of making treaties with Christians instead of making war on them. His control is also weakening because many of his so-called subordinate chiefs are themselves becoming more powerful, command large numbers of men and are jealous of Ibn Saud. Such control as he has is maintained by bribery and by never asking them to take any unwilling action. At the Clayton- Saud conference Saud admitted that he had not told his followers ofthe Iraq Boundaries because he dared not do so; the arabs cannot tolerate the idea of the desert having boundaries. They strongly object to the existence of our Police Forts Sulman and Busaiya (Approx 30 30N 44 40E and 30N 46 10E) and they refuse to give back property looted from Iraq in the past; it was chiefly on these grounds that the conference broke, down. They would agree to camps of tents for the police and would let such camps be eatablished in the neutral zone. There is now a state of truce which all parties have agreed to maintain until the conference is reopened which is due to happen in about a couple of months, Atabih (Ibn Humaid) and Mutair (Faisel Dawish) who are Ibn Sauds most doubtful upporters have agreed to this truce. A son of Dawish has just been toAl Hafar (which is his own territory; approx 38 30N 45 50 E) and emphasised the necessity for the maintainance of the truce. (We had asi armoured car post at A1 Hafar during last autumn's affairs). But if when the Clayton-Saud conference reopens the arabs do not get their way it is mast probable that raiding will recommence as socnas the desert tribes grasp the situation; the raiding if it happens will probably be on a large scale. Koweit, Sulman and Busaiya and even Shaibah and Busrah will be likely objectives. Although Koweit is not in Iraq we are interested in it because from a strategical point of view it protects the left flank of the Iraq Frontier. It has to be remembered that in many places the raiding tribes are only a days march from the Iraq Frontier and four days from Basrah itself, Ibn Saud himself is not entirely free from suspicion; he is continually trying to extend his power and influence and there are rumours thit he has been endeavouring to collect taxes in the hill country behind Muscat. When Squadron Leader Keith met opposition during his march across the Peninsula from Sohar there was some evidence to show that the opposition was due to envoys of Ibn Saud. On the other hand in what is his own proper shpere of influence he is going very cautiously and has not been trying to collect taxes lately lest he should meet with a r®bu•J ^7 No. 405-S OOMFIDEHTIAL. inii»iiijiii» I nil III—^WWPPP^I '.y- ■ t ,V-■ - - - f NG ■-•■ i I Political Agency, Kuwait. 21st July 1928. * n VL.
