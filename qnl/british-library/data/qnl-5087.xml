Mounted at 6-15 a m. We were obliged to turn out of our road, and to keep towards the Diala on account of the water left by rain. The line of Zagros, extending to the Tauk, formed the extreme boundary of our view as soon as we left Techubuk. Arrived at Deli Abbas at 9 a.m. Mounted at 5-30 a.m. We could not go the direct passage over the Hamrin hills on account of the water from the late rains. At 6-30 a.m. we arrived at the pa^s in the Hamrin hills, called Sakal Toutan. Here our road was north 10° east. At 7-30 a.m. the road to Baradan branched off. We meant to have gone to Baradan, but the Karin was reported to be too difficult to ford (April) in consequence of the rains. Our road due north. At 8-15 a.m. we left the mountain on our left hand, and reached the bridge of the Narin at 10-20 a.m. Mounted again at 11 a.m. At 12-40 p m. arrived at Kara Tapa. Excellent going all the way. Marched at 5 30 a.m. north 10° east over gravelly hills, on the western declivity of which Kara Tapa is situated; slope extremely gentle : de scended into a small valley, then over an arm of the hills, from which we descended by a long slope to the Tchemen bridge at 7-30 a.m.; thence north, to the broad torrent, at 8-30 a.m. Over a plain and by Telischan. At 9-10 a.m. entered on another elevation, also by a very gentle slope. At 9-40 a m. mounted again, and at 11 a.m. arrived at Kifri. %10 R oute No. 9—contd. No. of stage. Names of stages.

At 7 a.m. left the hills, and entered theBeiat plain, which slopes down very gently from the iifri hills to the basin of the Tchemen ; course north 85° west. At 7-30 a.m. we come to a ravine with a small stream of rain-water; thence north 80° west. At 8 a.m. north 55° west. At 8-20 a m. Kuru Chai, a broad torrent bed, with a little water in it. Halted at Beiat. Mounted again at 9 a.m. ; road north 45° west. At 9-30 a.m. Kizil Kharaba, a ruin on the road. From Kizil Kharaba, north 50° west. At 10-30 a.m. another ' teppeh,' or ruin. At 10-45 a m. large Beiat villages. At 11-30 a.m. another large village. We now lost sight of the Hamrin hills, which were on our left all day, by their running off more west. Tuz Khurmati now comes in sight, bearing north 20° west. About a quarter of an hour before coming to Tuz Kurmati, we passed the torrent ; it is called the Ak Su, and comes down from Ibrahim Khanji. On our left, and distant about a couple of hours, we saw the village of Yenijeh, which is on the present post road from Bagdad to Tauk. At 12-30 p.m., having crossed the torrent, arrived at Tuz Khurmati. Left at 5-30 a.m. Road north 15° west. At 6-45 a.m. road north 30° west. We had the gypsum hills close on our right. On our left a plain inclined down by a very gentle slope to the Hamrin hills, which were distinctly visible at the distance of between 3 and 4 hours. They appear to make abend here, or advance from the west, the nearest part to us being indented like an embattled wall, and bearing north 85° west. The Adhem stream passes the mountains half an hour below this part, and below that again is Demir Kapi, After the indented or notched part, the chain ap pears again to bend westerly. At 7 a.m. north 45 west. Here the gypsum range appears to end, but it does not really terminate, or rather it becomes a low range of gravelly hills, inclin ing towards the west.

The Hamrin just in sight on our left. At 7-20 a.m. arrived at the village of Jameila. We now began to ascend the range of hills; that is to say, the western range of the fork sent out by the Kifri hills. They run north-west to the village of Matara. We reached at 7-40 a.m. a platean, or extent of gravelly ruins. Our road north 50° east. At 8 a.m. came to other ridges of inclined strata. Road north 65° east. At 8-45 a.m. reached a spot overlooking the plain, or basin of Leilan, whence the hills slope gradually and gently to the plain. From here, Leilan lies north; the road did not go straight to the village, but bent a little. Arrived at Leilan at 10-5 a.m. From here I could see Kerkuk on a bearing of north 30° west, 10 geographical miles off. The intervening country is a perfect plain. Taza Khurmali is 3 hours off. Half a mile north is the village of Yahyawa. Left Leilan at 5-^0 a.m., road north 30° east along the Leilan stream. In half an hour we reached the hills, which here rise at once from the plain into a plateau. On ascending the plateau our course was north 70° east. At 6-15 a.m. our direction was north 25° east, and so continued for the remainder of our march ; the Leilan water on our left all the way. At 7-30 we descended into a valley formed by a little stream which rushes down to meet the Leilan. Halted for an honr ; arrived at camp at 8-30 a.m. Mounted at 5-30 a.m.; road north along the valley of the Leilan water. At 6-15 a.m. road north 40° east. At 6-30 a.m. north 55° east. At 7 a.m. north 25° east. At 7-20 north 60° east. At 7-45 north 80° east. At 8 north 75° east. We now left the Leilan and crossed the range of hills—what I call the plateau,—going about north-west. Here the streams run down to Kurdistan. At 8-50 a.m. we descended by a di rect, but not difficult, descent north 70° east, which in 20 minutes brought us to the fask landing- place. Hence we descended by an extremely gentle slope in north 45° east to Chemchtfmal, where we arrived at 10 a.m.12 R oute N o. §—-condd No. D istance in miles. of stage. Names of stages. Inter mediate.

The ravines, which are very deep, are made by innu- merable little rills. At 9 a.m. we arrived at Derbend. Left the pass, and proceeded in north 75° east. The valley soon opens, having the Bazian hills on each side. The Gudrun mountain was before us, a little on our left. Our road lay along the foot of the hills on the right of the valley. At 9-45 a.m. road east; at lo a.m. south 75 east. At 10-5. a.rn, we turned into a bianch of the valley, which is here very wide, in south 35° east to the village of Derghezin, which we reached at 10-15 a.m. Matched at 5-30 a.m. and directed our course across the valley from the western side, where Derghe- zin is situated to the eastern hills, along the foot of which we afterwards kept. At 6-30 a.m. w^e leached the direct road, and passed close on our right the village of Bazian ; the village was about 2^ miles off, under the west hills, in a direction north 60° west, our road south 30° east.

Route turns nearly due west over undulat ing cultivated country for 12 miles, then more stony, to the Zab ferry.

The route continues over level ground for 10 miles to the ford of the Khazir, ordinarily 80 yards wide and stirrup deep, gravel bottom. Then the ground becomes highly culti vated, with numerous villages; pass ruins of Khorsabad and Christian village of Burtala, finally passing the ruins of Nineveh before reaching the Tigris, which is crossed by the bridge to Mosul. With the exception of narrow bridges over the smaller water-cuts and irrigated fields, the whole route is easily passable for field guns from Bagdad to Mosul, except the hills between Deli Abbas and the hilly ground between Kerkuk and Altun Kiupri, where there would be some trouble, as also at the awkward bridges at Altun Kiupri. For the passage of the Zab boats would be re quired, as fording can seldom be depended upon. That portion of the route between Deli Abbas and Tauk is most deficient in supplies.

Barley and chopped straw are the only forage procurable. The telegraph line follows the route almost throughout. This report is taken from a reconnaissance by Lieu tenant-Colonel Gerard,C B,, C.I.H.,1882. Between Mosul and Erbil this forms the road from Suj Bulak in Persia by Rawanduz to Mosul. This is the main route from the Persian Gulf to Turkish Kurdistan, and is of great importance in consequence ; the route by the right bank of the Tigris (No. 11) is shorter but is less used, mainly on account of the Arabs, who pre} 7 on travellers. An important route runs from Kerkuk by Suleimania into Persia, and another from Erbil by Suj Bulak. The Bagdad-Kerkuk- Mosul route taken in conjunction with the Mosul-J azii ah-M ardin- Diarbekir-Kharput-M ala- tia Sivas route forms the grand trunk line of communication from Anatolia to the Persian Gulf, and is followed almost throughout by the International Telegraph line.

From here over the level alluvial plain to Tekrit. North of this the country becomes more barren, the route keeps near the river to the ruins of an ancient castle called Kala Mekrun. Beyond this the plain is perfectly level, broken up only by a few water-courses. After 25 miles leave the river on approaching the Jebel Hamrin hills, which are skirted for many miles. There are many wadies and the country is slightly undulating. After about 50 miles the Jebel Hamrin are crossed; here scarcely 150 feet above the plain, and the route returns to the Tigris near Shergut, the head-quarters of the Shammar Arab^, but in other respects a place of no importance. Beyond this there are seme sedentary Arabs who cultivate the ground; there is irrigation, and some scrubby oaks and acacia shrubs are met with. There are also some sulphur springs and bitumen ponds. Continue near the river for about 20 miles, then descend somewhat to an al luvial plain, and reach Hammam Ali, where there are hot springs ; ruins of Nirarud across the river. From here it is perfectly level, going over a grassy plain to Mosul. There are no difficulties on this route except want of supplier Water is always obtainable from the river, and the country,is practically level throughout. The people are Shammar Arabs mostly, but there are some sedentary Jebur Arabs. Some of the irrigation channels are somewhat awkward to cross. Communication could always be kept up with the river. This report is taken from one by Mr. Cameron, 1879 ; but the route is seldom used by travellers on account of the pred atory Shammars, that by Kerkuk and Arbela be- ing generally taken. From the military point of view it is, however, of undoubted importance as it^ marches with the great waterway of the Tigris. A route along the left bank of the river would cross the two great Zab rivers, besides others, which would cause much inconvenience. It must be remembered that if friendly relations were established with the Arabs, quantities of sheep and a large number of camels could be obtained along this route.■ 17 Route No. 12.

Between the Zab and Kawanduz it iseasier, but is not fit for wheels in some places, and the gradients are steep. Between the Zab and Suj Bulak this route is a good deal used, and is one of the main routes into Persia. The shortest route from Mosul to Rawanduz keeps to the south of the hills as far as possible, but crosses the Jebel Maklub. Colonel Gerard went from Mosul to Rawanduz direct by Erbil; continuing his journey to Suj Bulak, and there would not appear to be any very great difficulties in the way. Some of the valleys of the Zibar and Bahdinan district are very productive, and there is cultivation also in the Rawanduz Chai basin. Route No. 15-A. F kom R awanduz to U shnu via K alashtn P ass.

Be- yond this a country of low sandstones led to the plain of Nav-knr, watered bj the Khazir; it is bounded on the north by the Rabban Hormuz, at the fbot of which is the large village of Bagh- Idri. Reached Ain Sifin after a journey across the plain of about 4 hours, and entered upon mountainous country. Two hours' journey over the outlying hills brought us to a more lofty range of limestones and sandstones, which we crossed by a narrow glen. About 21 miles up this, ravine the valley widens and gives off two lateral and parallel valleys; that to the south contains the village of Maghei- rah ; in the central valley is that of Kathandiyah; while to the right is the northern vale, more narrow and deeply clad with wood. We turned up the valley of Sheikh Adi; the village stands on the top of an adjacent cliff. The two largest villages of the Yezidis are Bah- Ashikah at the western foot of Jebel Maklub and Bah-Idri at the foot of Rabban Hormuz A gentle ascent led to the crest of the Sheikh Adi range. Numerous vineyards occupied the hill sides, and by these we descended into the small vale of Berbets, out of which we found our way by a narrow and precipitous ravine about | a mile in length, with a bad i;oad, which leads to the fertile valley of Ghanar Su ; this valley con tains many villages. We crossed it in a diagonal direction, and in about 1| hours reached a village at the foot of the range on the north. The ascent occupied 1| hours ; the range broke oS suddenly in a steep precipice, beneath which, in a narrow vale at a depth of 800 feet, were many villages and gardens. We were obliged to alter ojir course and keep up the side of the precipice till, passing over some broken hills, we found our- selves in the valley of Chelojd, bounded north and south by narrow ranges of limestone. We proceeded to the village of Zindar, at the foot of ^ the Tura or Jebel Gharah. The road led over this chain in a tortuous manner through wooded glens ; the height of the summit was 2,137 feet. There was still a good deal of snow on the eastern slope (June 9th).4 7J 25 Route N o. 16— con/d. No. of stage. Names of stages. Distancb ii^ miles. Inter mediate. Rbmaeks. Total. A MADIA Hayis D UARI GtJN-DUK Road over a gently-undulating and well-wooded countr y to the valley of A madia, which is but sparingly cultivated ; it contains many villages, partly of Kurds of the Bah din an tribe and partly of Chaldeans. Excepting the slight elevation intervening between the watershed of the Kha- bur and Gharah rivers, the valley extends from the Tigris to the vale of Rawanduz, being, how ever, curved about 12 miles to the east of Amadia in the direction of Ziberri, and is about 5 or 6 miles wide. The town is built on a rocky terrace, and is every where surrounded by cliffs. There are two gates, one to the north-west and the other to the east. The town stands on the eastern portion of the terrace. It is principally inhabited by Jews, of whom there are 70 houses. Issuing by the eastern gate, we got into the gardens and vale north of the town. Crossed the pa^s of the Matineh mountain, called also the Geli Mazukah pass; the elevation was 5,840 feet, and there were patches of snow. From this point the extensive district of Berrawi ex tended before us; in our neighbourhood was a long valley dotted with Christian villages. Be yond it were two distinct lofty snow-clad chains of mountains - ' Tur Devehli^and ' Tura Shina.' To the west the valley opened amidst forests, rock, and arable land. The four great tribes in Northern Kurdistan are Badhiuan, Buhtan, Hak- kiari, and Eawanduz. About an hour's descent brought us to the village of Hayis (Chaldeans). An hour's journey brought us to a perpendicular precipice, about 250 feet deep, at the bottom of which rolled the Robar Elmei, which flows to the Zab. Road lay down the Robar Elmei; crossed it by a wooden bridge, passing several Chaldean villages, and then up a tributary stream to the village of Duari, the residence of the bishop. We had a steep descent from the Tara Dari and reached a valley nearly filled up with snow. The bishop's residence was 4,917 feet; the crest of Duari 5,792 feet; and the vale with snow 4,917 feet. From hence we ascended again to the ciest of the Deralini hills (5,811 feet), thence a prolonged descent of 1^ hours to the village of Gun-duk, inhabited by tributary Kurds. This deep valley reaches down to the Zab; it is bounded on the north by the great range called Karasi Tigari. The path or mule-way led round the southern slope of the Karasi Tigari; the Zab26 R oute No. 16— contd. No. of stage. D istance in miles. Names of stages Inter mediate. Total.

As we opened upon the valley of Lizan a most in. teresting scene presented itself. Before us was an alpine ran^e of limestone rock, stretching east- nortb-east and west-south-west, with lofty preci pices fronting west. There was one gap in this rampart through which the Zah found its way. There are several roads from Lizan to the Hakkiari country, but all of them have to compass the ascent of the great limestone range east of the valley. One of them is carried over the side of the Tsaria Mount, east of the Zab, but is not accessible by mules; all the rest present great difficulties. We proceeded up the valley of the Izani; passing the village of Miniani (divided into two parts about a quarter of a mile from one another); and 3 miles from the same place the village of Amrah, I mile beyond which was Zawaitha. Beypnd Lizan the valley begins to rise, but above this is a shelving portion of declivity which is everywhere cultivated. In the middle of the valley the cultivation and cottages are mostly on the south side. At Amrah we commenced the ascent of the moun tain. In one hour's time we reached the foot of the diffs, and then turned along the face of the precipices near its foot. The road was very bad; at length we reached the gap in the rocks. The crest of the Kuriki (the mountain we were now crossing), leaving Ashitah to the left (or west), was 7,652 feet in elevation. The descent was still steeper than the ascent. Reached Taraspino, a lar^e village at the foot of the mountain. The guides declaring that this was a bad village, we moved on for another range, and gained the crest^ after an hour. We then continued along the side of the hill, above the valley of the Zab, and came to a summer pasture, called Zoma iSu- warri (7,169 feet). There is a road across the mountain at a lower level than the one we were at present following, but it is only available at a short season of the year. The prospect from here was grand, the scenery bold and various. Our road still lay along the side of the mountain; snow more abundant, and the slopes often very steep. We got down to the valley of Itha by means of a glacier, or snow patch, about a mils in length by 300 yards in width. There are three villages in the valley-Itha, Pir Be'.a, and Galitha.27 Route No. 16— contcl. No. of stage. 14 Names of D istance its miles. Inter mediate. Total. R emarks. Galitha 15 16 Malotah Kiyan 17 Leihun Proceeded down the valley to Galitha, and there commenced another ascent, almost as' fatiguing as that of the Knriki. Having gained the crest, we had nothing to do but to descend another glacier. We then found ourselves in an alpine valley, at the lower part of which was the village of Malotah. This valley, at an elevation of 6,200 feet, was partly cultivated and partly covered with snow. The ascent to day was not so steep. The hills were wooded with fine oak. Gaining the next crest Warandun, we found ourselves above a pasture with a large patch of snow. The descent was steeper than the ascent, and ex tended about 800 feet. We descended another thousand feet through a thick forest to the valley of Kiyan, where there is a lead mine. There are two villages at Kiyan, the upper one Mahoraedan, the lower Chaldean. In the parallel of Kiyan, or a little below it, and at the foot of the Warandun, the Zab is divided into two branches ; the southerly branch comes from the country beyond Julamerk, the northerly from Leihun. This latter is called ' Berdizawi,' or Little Zab. A huge mountain mass, called ' Meskannah,' extends between the two rivers. After a short ascent, we travelled along the banks of the Berdizawi, sometimes over cliffs which overhang the river. In little more than an hour we came to a torrent from a snow-clad chain called ' Maranan,' , to the west, it. was 13 yards wide, by 2 in depth, and was crossed by the usual bridge of interwoven branches. Near the same point was a bridge over the Berdizawai; a little cultivation, but no village. Beyond Mar an an River to the north are two rocky ranges; the most easterly and lofty of these is called Sinaber; beyond it is the upland of Lei hun. We crossed the first and lower ranges; then, turning to the north, the path led along the foot of the cliffs, and then up rocks, like steps. On the upland of Leihun, we fourd the Berdizawi divided into 3 branches. We crossed all these streams by twig bridges. This upland is inhabited by the Kurdish tribe of Leihun under the Beg of Julamerk. Many vil lages with much cultivation are scattered about. We crossed the river and turned rather to the south-west to the village. From Leihun the direction of our travels was altered ; instead of travelling constantly north, we now turned to the eastward over the upland of Leihun, and low ranges of hills.28 K oute No. 16— contd.

Another ascent brought us in view of Julamerk, bearing north 80° east. The town consists of about 200 houses, or mud hovels, which nearly encircle the castle hill, the residence of the Beg. It is situated in a deep hollow, on the Kurdistan upland, at an elevation of about 5,400 feet. To the east is a bold rocky mountain called Shembat, about 3,000 feet above Julamerk. Around, espe cially to the north and north-west, is seen culti vation, with a few villages. We descended to one of these, called Merzin, and thence went on to the Armenian village of Pagi. Left Pagi for Bashkala. We had a gentle ascent up to the shoulder of Tur Burj-ul-lah, which lasted nearly 2 hours, and then descended to the valley, or rather upland of Kochannes, a small village upon a level upland vale, advancing over the valley of the Zab. Rode some distance along the side of Kochannes hill, having a higher range, that of Aref Tagh, before us. We then descended by a long and steep, though otherwise good pathway, to a val ley in which were many villages. We then as cended again to a cultivated upland at the foot of Aref Tagh, where were the Chaldean villages of Espin and Gharanis, both with towers of defence. Our camp at Gharanis was at an alti tude of 7,009 feet. There are two roads from Gharanis, one over the mountains, the other by the valley of the Zab. We took the latter, although the longer route. Made two slight ascents and descents and then reached some sulphur mines in the bottom of a valley; passed the Chaldean village of Kermi, and then turned off from the valley of the Zab, which was here rocky and wooded, to the north east, passing a valley with two more Chaldean villages. We followed again for some time the valley of the Zab where it winded through a marshy up land vale, at the end of which it received a large tributary, which we crossed by a bridge. Ascend ing an upland a little above the Zab, we reached the Chaldean village of Meilawa. The country towards the head-waters of the Zab beyond this quite changed its character. There are still a few mountain points, as Arghi Tagh, to the south-east, with the bold outlying 'Hock of Tiri.' But the outline of the chain is29 R oute N o. 16— conid* No. of stage. Names of stages.

Meilawa was at an elevation of 6,418 feet. Road still continued up the open valley of Zab ; 2J hours brought us where two streams met: one, from the mountains beyond Bashkala; the other' from Kanda Kilissa. We soon came in view of Bashkalah, about two miles to our left. It is a large village, built round the base of a conical hill, which supports a castle. It is said to con tain 200 houses. It is governed by an officer of the Beg of Jula- merk, and is tributary to the Pasha of Van. Keeping still up the valley of the Zab, we came to an ancient Armenian monastery. At this point the Zab is divided into two streams, one of which comes from the southern declivities of the Erdish Tagh in the district of Albak, the other from Koniyeh, Karasun, and Kashen. Kanda Kilissa is a very old Armenian monastery. We left the valley of the last tributaries to the Zab, and entered upon a hilly country with occa sional ravines. Crossed over a ridge, and descend ed by Kbani Berin ; re-ascended amid rooky hills, from whence we had our first view of the plains of Salmas bearing due east. Our descent from hence occupied 3 long hours, when we reached some basaltic cliffs, which led directly to the cultivated plain. Two more hours, amid villages and gardens, brought us to the Chaldean village of Khosrova. This district of Salmas is covered with villages, which have generally a common market, and the whole is enclosed like a fort. This place is designated sometimes Salmas, some times Dilman, but is generally known in ordinary parlance as ' Shahr.'

These routes lead for the most part through the heart of Kurdistan, and through a mountainous difficult country, in which military operations could only be conducted on a small scale. This is especially the case in the Zab basin, the routes from Amadia to Julamerk, from Rizan on the Zab to Neri, and from Amadia to Rawanduz being in many places awkward even for past transport. The upper basin of the Khabur is sunk deep among rugged mountains, and is most difficult of access from all sides. The same is the case with the upper Hazil basin. Routes across the Nestorian districts of Baz, Diz, Chab, and Oramur are extremely difficult, even for pack animals.

Beyond this the road skirts the Tigris crossing the Zozan, a large stream, HO yards wide, and the valley then contracts, and the route becomes a difficult track. There is a ferry at 4 miles from Mansuria and another at Fin ok 7 miles. The cliffs bordering the river been very steep. A little further valley opens what, and route recedes from the river, crossing grassy slopes, fertile, and a little cultivation. At 16 miles a plateau (2,150 feet) is reached, which is crossed, and there is than a bad aseent to Penduk (3,450 feet). Some cultivation and good soil, scrub on the hill-sides. The road descends again over fertile grassy hill-sides to the river at 6 miles, scrub and trees ; the bottom of the valley is followed for 7 miles then a spur is crossed ; bad route. At 23 miles, at Ghena Khan, another spur is crossed, and ronte descends to Balak in the river bed. The valley is here ^ mile broad. The road keeps up the flat bed of the river, the valley widening, and after 9 miles reach the Botan Su, which is forded. It is 75 to 100 yards wide and 3 feet deep. Near this is Til. The route follows the right bank of the Botan Su northwards; bad track at first, but improves, and the valley widens, allowing of a little cultivation. At 10 miles, after fording the Bitlis Su, there is a steep ascent out of the valley by a good pnved 10-ft. road for 800 fnet, reaching a broad tilled plateau at 19 miles, and a little further in a hollow is Sert. This route, which is taken from Colonel Bdl's and Lieutenant Maunsell's reconnaissance, is of great importance, and is the chief rnute from Mosul to the plateau land of Kurdisfan and Armenia. Between Mosul and Jazirah there is no difficulty for wheeled transport, but although guns could be got to Sert from Jazirah, this could not be done without great difficulty. The usual route from Mosul io Diarbekir is by this line as far as Jazirah. Camels are not found north of Jazirah. A very important hill route leads from Jazirah by Shattak to Van,* which would be followed in proceeding from Mosul to Van, unless a more eastern line by Amadia were taken. The route mentioned as turning off to Alk©sh is important as leading to Amadia. The hills to the right of this route, after it passes Zakho, are rugged im general, the tributaries of the Tigris issuing from deep gorges, access along which'is difficult.

It has often been proposed to make a military road from Jazirah by Sert to Bitlis, and strategically this is much needed. No very great difficulties would be experienced in engineering a carriage road from Jazirah as far as Sert. Population of Sert is variously stated at from 7,000 to 14,000. Fuel is scarce, and water-supply poor. Road from Sert is an up-pnd-down track over ridges and ravines with some steep gradients, but a good mule-path. The hills are huge undulations with no wood, but plenty of small streams. Ja- viersur is a small village. Road descends by 1-foot track, then becomes very steep (i), then over ridges and valleys.

Ascend to Amadia. Leaving Amadia, Ainsworth's route seems to have been the same as Colonel Bell's and Mr. Binder's to the first col, and thence to Duari (4,900 feet), the chief place of the Nestorian district of Berawi. Then cross over into another \alley, in which is Gunduk, good pasture. Then over hills above the Zab, which runs in a deep, inaccessible ravine, descending into a large-valley, in which close to the Zab is Lizan, a large Nestorian village. The Kurdish village of Jenan is on the other side of the river. Route turns west up the Lizan valley, cultiva tion and villages for 4 miles to TJmra. Then turn north, and cross a range (7,650 feetj, de scending on the other side to Taraspino, in another valley. Cross out of this into the Itha Yalley, which is descended past some villages to Galitha, after which there is a Northern range to be crossed to Malotah, some cultivation (6,200 feet). Another range is then crossed to Kiyan, and the route descends into the valley of the Berdizawi, which is followed up for some miles, and then crossed, the route turning east to Leihiin is an upland pastoral country, many vil lages, and much cultivation. The route then runs east, and passing Eshaya crosses the range between the Berdizawi and the Zab, and de scends to Julamerk. The first part of this route is from a re port of Colonel Bell, V.C. From Amadia to Jula merk is from Ainsworth. Below is given an alter native route from Amadia to Julamerk, which makes a detour across the Zab.

The left bank of the Zab is then followed up for 6 miles to a wooden bridge over it, which is crossed, and the route then takes up through a side ravine to Julamerk. From Julamerk there are two routes to Bashkala ; that usually followed crosses the hills for 4 miles to the head of the valley of Kochannes, the same as the route to Van, and keeps over the high hills that here separate the Zab Valley from the Bhotan Su to the Nebunar Yaila at the head of the valley of the Gerjanis Su. The right side of this valley is followed in a northerly direction for 5 miles, v here the stream is crossed, and its left bank is followed in an easterlj direction down to Manjenan. Several villages here in the valley. Gerjanis is 2 miles lower. The route then crosses over into the valley of the Sarishkhan Su near Sanshkl-an, and thence northwards, crossing another valley to Banhkala. This is a most difficult route throughout till close to Bashkala and quite impracticable for wheels. Between Amadia and Julamerk it is larger and quite as difficult as route No. 18. From Julamerk there are two routes to Bashkala, that described and one nearer the Zab,which appears to be equally bad. The Zab itself, below the junction of the Nehil Cliai, running in a very deep gorge very difficult to pass. Bad as is this route and No. 18 they are made use of by great numbers of Kurds, Nestorians migrating from Albak and Gavar toBahdinan and Mosul. This report is taken from routes of Colonel Bell, Mr. Binder, and Mr. Devey. Colonel Bell went direct from Bashkala to the Thai Valley. Mr. Devey has reported on a route from Amadia by Beit-es-Shabab on the Khabur basin to Sher- nakh, but this traverses very difficult country and seems to be little used.

The route continues over easv country, with cultivation and villages, between the Kuidistan hills and the Kara Su, past Zilket (8 miles) and Mamik (13 miles) to Nurshin, a Turkish village at the head of the Kara Su basin, near which is the large Kurdish village of Gotni ; the route ascends on to the plateau between this and Lake Yan, and runs 5 miles across this south-east to a ruined Khan, where the route from Bitlis to Akhlafc crosses it. The usual route from Mush to Bitlis is that above described, turning otf south-west at this point, as described, the reverse way. This plateau, known as Rahwan, is of import ance as defending the head-waters of the Bitlis Su, and the best routes from the north and from Mush to Bitlis, and thence by Sert to the Tigris. The route now turns north-east and descends to Lake Yan at Ortab. Up to this point there would be no diffi- cnlty for troops of all arms moving from Mush. From here the route runs close to the lake shore 1| miles to Tukh, where there is a stone bridge over a stream fordable in summer. This route then runs for 4 miles along the shore and then crosses a promontory to Klsmali. From here the route runs inland be tween an extinct volcano and the hills to the south, descending into a valley where there are four villages, the principal of which is Vanik. A difficult route from Bitlis joins in here from the south-west. The route continues near the lake past the village of Khazeh to the har bour of Surp, a small land-locked bay, the village of Surp on the north side. From here the track crosses the hills to the plain of Gollu, 3 or 4 miles from the shore, and reaches Gollu. From the plain the track ascends steeply about 1,000 feet, and after rough ascents and descents traverses a ridge high above the lake forming the water-parting between it and the Tigris basin. It then runs inland, past Narrigus to near Pelo. Here a route from Sert from the south-west joins in. This is 12 miles from41 R oute N o. 25 — concld. D istance im- No. miles. of Names of stages.

The route now runs along low ground between the hills and the lake, passes a monastery after 4 miles, and then, after crossing a spur, passes Yostan. From near Yostan a route crosses southwards to Mukus, reaches the village of 10 A tanan 13j 97 Atanan. The route now runs north-east, and after 2 miles crosses the Khushab River near its mouth. There is a rickety hurdle bridge of one span, but with low water the river, which is 20 yards wide, is fordable. There are also two bridges higher up. The plain of the Khushab is fertile, well cultivated, and thickly populated. 11 E ngl 6 103 Engl, a large Armenian village of 80 houses.

The road turns east up this valley for 7i miles to where it crosses the river near Zernak by a high single-arched bridge 10 feet wide. The valley has been narrowed and the route now runs along the hills that rise on the left bank for 2 miles, then the valley opens some what ; the route crosses some spurs and reaches Mahmudiye, or Khushab. An alternative route to Bashkala runs sonth-east over the hills from Mahmudiye. Here the road again crosses the river by a good stone bridge of three arches, 10 to 12 feet wide. At this point the valley of the Khushab is very narrow. The route, difficult in places, runs up the valley and recrosses to left bank by a ford at 4 miles, village of Kasir, a little further up valley, which the route now leaves, striking up a minor valley south-east to Shushnamerg, a Kurdish village : continues risin&lt;* steeply in places to a pass (9,100 feet), where it crosses the watershed between the Khushab and the Zab rivers; the pass is often blocked with snow.

This valley the track desends 3 miles to the village of Mirawur, where the route turns south out of the valley over the hills past the villages of Helisan, and over some spurs, past Alalian, to Bashkala. From here the route runs S.S.E. past Eesulan over the cultivated plains for 2 miles, then descends into a ravine, which it follows down to Kilagorn, and a mile further it reaches the Zab, or Albak Su as it is still called here sometimes, which is crossed by a bridge (5,800 feet) of stone, two arches, 6 feet wide, which here runs in a valley southwards, sunk 50 feet to 70 feet below the sloping plateau of Bashkala.

The route runs south-east over hillj country, passing the Kurdish villages of Khak- karavok and Biz Deran, and at 13 miles descends steeply into the valley of the Nihaila Gavari, a stream running north-west into the Zab. The track is here very bad, the valley, which is rocky and narrow, is followed up, the track running along the right bank to Muhammed Agha Kiupri, where there is a good stone bridge over the Gavari. The route keeps up the right bank, the valley opening out, and some distance further is Kaprel, an Armenian village at the commencement of the level plain of Gavar. This plain is 20 miles long from north-west to south-east by 10 miles broad at its widest part; it is quite flat and contains many villages, but is swampy in some places in the centre. At Kaprel a route from Kochannes joins in. The route leaving the stream which flows through the centre of the plain, skirts the hills on its north-east side to Diza (5,800 feet). From Diza there is a route to Urumiah in Persia, and difficult roads run south wards. Start north form Diza ascending from the Gavar plain, pass villages of Sakeran and Nudian, then up a narrowing grassy valley to Sheikh Amir, a Kurdish village of 60 houses. Soon afterwards the stream down the valley is forded, easy route, ascending gradually to the Delasi pass (7,000 feet). This is the watershed between the Zab basin and that of the Nazlu Chai, which flows into Lake Urumiah. Eoute descends east into the Baradost Chai Valley, pass ing Surian, and arrives at Barsan, a wretched village. Continue descending the valley, narrow in some places, to Bazirga. This is the Turkish frontier post and is a miserable village. The route continues down the valley, passing the frontier after 2 miles, and 2 miles further issues on to the Baradost plain, which it crosses east to Gangachin. From here the route runs by Masta- kar and Hassar (21 miles) to Urumiah. This is an important caravan route and would be followed going from Bashkala to Urumiah, and is easy throughout; although not used for wheel, it is practicable for field artillery. Carts are used between Urumiah and the Baradost plain. Sup plies are not obtainable between Diza and the frontier; water plentiful.

The river runs through a wide and fertile valley forming the district of Haiazo, in which there are many villages. Instosh, a large Armenian village. Eoute runs south-east, and after 4 miles ascends out of the valley by steep zigzags, crosses a ridge, and descends for a short distance steeply, then gently to a stream running south-west to the Botan or Satak Su, which is forded. A mile further on is Aghje Kala, a Kurdish village to the left of the road, which continues south-east over undulatin ground, descending to a plateau, in which some deep ravines of streams going to Botan Su to be crossed. This is the beginning of the Mur- duz district. Eventually the road descends to the valley of the Botan Su, which here runs south-west in a deep ravine ; the river is crossed close to the junction of the Sekunis Su, the val ley of which is followed up to Sekunis. There is a bridge here over a stream which curves, running north-east near this point. The route keeping to the left of the Botan Su now ascends gradually over upland pastures for 10 miles to a pass (9,800 feet), which marks the watershed between the Botan and the Zab, and descends into the Nestorian valley of Berinar, through which flows the Upper Bardawa Zab in a general south-westerly direction, and passes near the villages of Hadalanis and Kobanis. There is then a steep ascent and another pass is crossed, 9,800 feet above the sea, and the valley of Kochannes is entered ; the route skirts the upper end passing about 2 miles from Kochannes, the seat of the Nestorian patriarch. From Kochannes a difficult route runs down the valley east to a ford over the Zab, which is pass able only in summer, and thence over the hills to Diza ; it is rough and difficult and there are no supplies.

Mr. Devej deFcribes a somewhat different route between the Khushab ■ and the crossing of the Botan Su, apparently going more to the right.

Although this route is not used for wheels, it tra verses easy country, and there are few points between Yan and Kotur that could not be tra versed by field artillery. Supplies are scarce after leaving Erchek, but water is plentiful ; little fuel. This report is taken from a reconnaissance by Colonel Bell, 1885. It is not necessary to go as far north as Sarai, although that is the usual route followed ; a route runs almost due east from Mulla Hassan, reaching the Kotur Chai Valley, near Tup on the route from Sarai to Albak, and this is some miles shorter than that taken ' by Colonel Bell, which was also taken by Millingen. The Millan Kurds are found about the upper valleys of the Kotur Chai and of the Mermid Su. It should also be noted that the shortest route from Erzerum to Khoi would be by Kara Chobau- Agantz.Peregri-Sarai,* and that artillery eould pass by this route very nearly as easily as by Alashkert and Kizil Diza.

At this point the route to Kotur turns oft to the east. 3 miles further across level ground (near the Erchek lake after fording the Mehmejik Su) is another Armenian village of 120 houses, Kharagonis. The route then quits the lake and ascends steeply to a plateau ; this it crosses and descends to Pirsolau, on the Mermid Su, several small villages ; the route continues for 2J miles to the Kurdish village of Ak Bulak, and then ascends out of the valley, crosses a pass (7,250 feet), and descends steeply to the plain north-east of Lake Van at Adzort, an Armenian village. Then crosses the plain to Peregri. The route runs up the Bendimahi Valley, crossing to the right bank over easy country to near Bayazid Agha,, a Kurdish village. Beyond this the stream is forded at the plain of Abagha, peopled by Kurds, and near this a route runs over the hills direct to Diadin.

This route would be practicable for field artillery, although it is not used for carts. This is taken from a report of Captain Clayton, 1882, compared with a later report of Mr. Devej. It would of course be possible to take the shore road from Van to near Peregri, and by this means avoid all difficulty as to water, besides going by a better road. From Van to Peregri by this route would be about 53 miles, and the whole distance to Bayazid, going round by Kizil Diza, would be 107 miles. From Kizil Diza to the passes over the Russian frontier to the north is about 20 miles. Another route from Van to Bayazid would be by Sarai and thence to Peregri, but besides being a great detour, this line crosses little-known country at considerable elevations.

From here the road runs eastwards over easy country with some cultivation, descend ing to cross the D^delu Su, and then crossing another ridge before reaching Koz, descends to a valley to Haspisinek, whence to Agantz. Here it meets the route along the shore of Lake Van from the south-west. Agantz is the point whence routes cross the Ala Dagh moun tains to Kara Kilissa and Diadin. Beyond Agantz there is a good carriage road, which runs near the lake. At 6 miles village of Haidw Bagh is passed, and a little further the stream of the same name is crossed by a stone bridge of one arch (stream fordable). The road continues to Arm's, a miserable village, another close by. From here the road crosses a plain for 2 miles to Kara Khan, near the north-east corner of the lake, a Turkish village of 40 houses ; the village of Feregri is about 5 miles to north-east. The route now runs south to the Bendi-mahi River, which is crossed by a stone bridge 60 yards long of two arches, 10 feet roadway; the river can generally be forded in summer ; 3 miles further the road passes Shukembul, beyond which the country is level for 4 miles to a promontory at the end of the Peregri plain keeping near the lake. The road ascends somewhat to Merek, a village some 600 feet above the lake: from here there is a direct route to Van.

This re port is taken from reconnaissances by Captain Clayton, R.A., 1881, and Colonel M. Bell, U.E., in 1885. From Agantz this route is the post route from Erzerum.

During the late war the Turkish Armj occupied, the position, and constructed some field-works thereon. From a piactical point of view the position is essentially defensible : inapproachable on the left flank, it can only with difficulty be attacked from the positions dominating its right flank. The road from Eizertm (the line of retreat of the Turks) passes by the right flank of the position. It is 7 miles distant from Erzerum, and is a dreary, cold, iiihosp itable place. In descending, the road follows an easy slope, and after 3 miles a small rivulet intersects it.. I'he route now lay on the plain, and skirted the hills forming the southern boundary of the Passin Valley. From this point branch oif two roads which lead, the one to Kars, the other to Van and Mush. On approaching the village of Ertef, the port of Hassan Kaleh was on our right, Ertef is a little Armenian village situated at the entrance oB a narrow valley which penetrates into the mountains. As far as Ertef we followed a kind of road, but from here it was a mere track wind ing up the steep ascent, and often skirting deep ravines. After a succession of more or less steep ascents and descents we came to the small village of Eiubler. From Ertef the road had been very steep and trying; 4 hours of steep ascent. The chain of mountains which separates the basm of the Araxes from the valley rf Fassin must be between three and four thousand feet above The road from Eiubler to Kulli is a continuation of the steep aseent frokn Ertef. . On leaving EiUbler the path skirts some high ridges bordering a deep, long ravine. After an hour's march our road took a more southerly direction, i.e., to our right, and reached the culminating point of the Tek Dagh chain, where we found several small plateaux. The descent is much shorter, and consequently much steeper than the ascerit on the other side. Its declivity must be 48° or 55°, so that in many places we had to walk. Kulli is only about two hours from the top ot the chain. A vast cemetery stretches along the north extremity of the village along the slope of the range.56 Route No. 34— No. Names of stages.

The river is scarcely 100 yards wide, but is a violent and boisterous stream • crossed over by a ferry made of inflated skins ' On emerging from the steep banks of the Araxes our road was over an undulating ground, which gradually rises to the Ak-Dagh, which divides from the bar,in of the miles from the river which connected two point of junction be- a long the valley of the A raxes Euphrates. At about'7 we traversed a plateau ridges of hills, and was a tween two lateral vallej's. On emerging from the pass we beheld valley, bordered to the north and south by two ranges of hills, the Ennis running in the middle. The road skirts the ridge of hills bordering the northern side of the valley till it reaches the village of Koslu. From the mountain pass to^ Koslu the distance is calculated to b^ some thing like 3| hours, the pass being considered as lying half-way between Kulli and Koslu. Koslu is a small village, not exceeding 20 houses. From Koslu our road was south-east. On the right was nothing worth mentioning, while on the^ left three villages were to be seen in the plain ; the first was in the middle of the plain, about two miles off ; the second on an elevation which sloped to the river ; the third, on the left, was called Kara Choban. Ihe mouth of the Ennis is 3 leagues fi'om Knra Iviupri, a small town on the banks of the Ennis, inhabited by Armen:ars. We followed the road which leads to the ford ; the water was rather deep. On the other side of the Ennis we had a small flat tract of country to cross ; the road then lay through a series of hills which run between the Euphrates and the Ennis. Karaghil is a small village inhabited by Ar menians. Frona Karaghil to the Euphrates is about 1,000 yards. To the left, in the plain, was the large borough of Kopp ; further up, close to the river, were situated, Sultanieh on the left and Kara Choban on the right bank. The right bank of the Euphrates, in this portion of its basin, is lower than the left bank. In many places a muddy bottom is to be found along the right shore. The Euphrates is here about 160 yards wide; we crossed on ' keleks,' which are much used in these parts.57 8 Route No. S i—conld. Names of stages. D istance in miles. Inter mediate PlEUN nazik Total.

Kazmuk Tadvan Oetab After crossing 1 we proceeded in a due easterly course, and gradually rose until we reached a small elevation, on which is the small village of Tegut, distant about 3 miles from the Euphrates. From this point the road which leads to Bitlis takes a southern direction. The general route of caravans from this to Van goes by the northern shore of the lake, passing through a level and easy country. The parting point of the two roads is at the landing-place on the Euphrates. We went bv the road along the southern shore and proceeded to Pirun, 3 hours distant from Tegut, and situated in the midst of broken scenery, formed by rocky hills and narrow val leys. At a short distance from Pirun the mountains which separate the plateau of Lake Van from the basin of the Euphrates rise abruptly, afford ing access only through narrow and difficult passes. Following the descent on the further slope of the mountains and skirting along the banks of a rivulet we reached Nazik. It is at the southern shore of the lake, where the beach is low and flat. The water is clear and sweet. The lake is richly provided with fish, the village of Nazik is on a neck or promontory, which projects from the eastern shore into the lake. The lake is of an oval form ; its greatest length from north to south is about 10 or 12 miles. From Nazik we directed our course towards a valley, the prolongation of the one we had fol lowed on coming to the lake. After crossing a rivulet, the road ascended to the end of the val ley, where the ridge divides the lake of Nazik from the basin of Lake Van. Fmm the ridge a beautiful panorama presents itself ; to the north, the Subhan Dagh; to the south, the Hakkiari mountains; to the east, the surface of the water is lost in ihe horizon.

Ortab is situated in a little plain surrounded by mountains. Road at first over marshy ground, then over mountains ; from the mountains it is difficult, down a steep descent. Surp stands on an elevation close to the mainland and appears almost bidden in a thick forest of chestnut trees. Timo taken from Ortab, 5 hours. , Eetraced our steps for some way, and re-mounted the steep hills above Snrp, until we rejoined the direct road to Van ; then, turning to the left, eastward, we came in sight of a bay. The road here gradually descends towards the lake and skirts in many places its shores. Passed the village of Shemzenan. Nusheh is a small hamlet of 40 houses, and is situated on the skirts of a small and narrow valley. Road through an easy and picturesque country ; the mountains of Van visible in the distance, also the islands of Akhtamar and Sein. Skirting the extremity of a small bay, passed within a short distance of the villages of Aghau- ank and Vostan, the latter lying at the foot of a hill, the ruined castle of Vostan dominating the village. Engl is situated on the banks of one of the most important tributaries of Lake Van, the Hoeh-ab River, a wooden bridge over it. Engl has a population of 1,000 souls, entirely Armenian.

The depth of water varies. I found a depth of 84 feet at a distance of 2 miles to the west. The water is saltish and very disagreeable to the taste. The northern and eastern shores are generally low and flat; the southern shore is, on the contrary, abrupt and rocky. The princi pal rivers and streams that pour their waters into the lake are 11 in number. The lake is 5,500 feet above the level of the sea. The navigation on the lake is scarcely worth men tioning. If steam navigation existed on the lake, a shorter and more convenient route to Erzerum and the Black Sea would be ensured : and in the event of war between Russia and Turkey the trade of Persia would find greater security by following this route.— (Millingen.) A town, capital of the Province of Van, Asiatic Turkey, south-east of Erzerum, south-west of Bayazid, west-north-west of Tabriz, north of Mosul, east-north-east of Diarbekir. It is situ ated in a large plain, said to be 43 miles in circuit, -studded with villages and gardens. The imposing mountains of Warak, Sipan, and Erdoz are in full view, bounding the plain on the north-north-west and south-east, while to the west lips the beautiful Lake of Van, dis tant one mile and a half. The Rock of Van is a most striking object. It is shaped somewhat, like a camel's back, rising in the centre and falling at both ends. The ridge runs east and west, and is about 600 yards long, divided into three parts, each of which is about 200 yards in length. The rock stands alone without any other hills in the vicinity, and is therefore more remarkable in its appearance. The mid dle and highest part is separated from the two ends by dykes, which are cut through the solid rock, so that each part is a separate fortifica tion, the capture of either extremity by no means ensuring that of any other portion. The middle division is about 120 feet in height and perpendicular on the south side : on the north it is formed in part of a very abrupt60 K oute N o. 2&gt;i-~concld. No. of stage. Names of stages.

Then continue across plains for 9 miles to ford of Nebi Chai, here at times a wide-flooded stream. Reach Hassan Kala. From Hassan Kala there are two routes of some importance, one leading north east to Neriman ; the other, crossing the Neb- Chai by a bridge, runs southward over the plain to Khinis and Mush. Owing to the narrowing of the plain at Hassan Kala the position is impor tant. From this point the road continues east wards over the plains, passing numerous villager; gradually the level ground contracts till it is only a mile wide at Kiupri Keni. A mile beyond this village is reach ed the Choban Kinpri or bridge over the Araxes (here also called Bingueul 8u), just below the point where the Nebi Chai joins it. The bridge is of stone, with six solid arches, and is 90 yards long, the left bank being considerably higher. The river is here a broad clear swift stream, sel dom, if ever, fordable ; it runs in a depression 150 feet below r the plateau on either side and | to 1 mile wide. The road, still running eastwards, crosses a plateau practicable in all directions ex cept in wet weather. There are some steep places at the crossings of the small streams. The vil lages of Omrakom, an important Turko-Persian place, Minduvan, and Kumatser (a large Christian village) are passed and the road reaches Yuzveren, an Armenian village with 40 houses, w here there is a bridge over a small stream. From Omrakom and Yuzveren carriageable routes lead over the hills to the south into the valley of the Sharian Su turning the Eshek Elias or Delibaba pass. Beyond Yuzveren the ground becomes much more hilly, several streams are passed, and the Delibaba valley is entered, the road turning south-eastwards to near Delibaba. The village of Delibaba is 1| miles north-east of the road. From here an important track leads to the frontier post of Kara Kilissa on the Araxes.

The road now turns eastwards along the high ground form ing the norlh side of the Shavian Su Valley, and about 2 miles from that river are grassy hills. There are several good positions hereabouts com manding the passages from the Sharian Suto the Araxes valleys. There are a few villages and some cultivation. Zeidikan. The higli ground between Zeidikan and Delibaba is during the summer time much resort ed to by nomad Kurds who bring their flocks to pasture. Zeidikan is important as being a point from which many tracks diverge. Of these one runs to Toprak Kalaby Mulla Suleiman ;from both M ulla Suleiman and Toprak Kala routes run over into the Ataxes Yalloy ; the telegraph runs by Toprak Kala to Kara Kilissa. Another nmch- frequented route crosses the Sharian Su at Khau* ser, leading over into the Murad Su Valley. The road from Zeidikan crosses the Alashkert plain, which is fertile and well cultivated, with numerous villages. The soil is alluvial. The road crosses several small streams, and in wet weather is muddy and difficult. The road passes through the village of Chalkani and reaches Kara Kilissa. Kara Kilissa is the meeting point of many routes. In this part of the countiy there are few^ Turks, the population consisting almost entirely of Kurds and Armenians. Jieyond Kara Kilissa the road keeps to the northern side of the Murad bu Valley to opposite the Persian village of Gerger, which is at the end of the Alashkert plain. It is on a knoll overlooking the Murad Su on its left bank. To the north are bare uplands rising to the Kizil Kara Dagh and Sineh Dagh. On the south the valley is wider.

The Murad Su is near this point spanned by a bridge, over which runs an important route to Van (see Route 39). After leaving Uch Kilissa the hills to the north recede and the road runs across a plain, swampy in places near the Murad Su, to 12 Diadin 10 145 Diadin, the upper part of its course being from south to north. The road now crosses some stony high ground which forms a watershed between the Murad Su Valley and that of the Baluklu Su at the hamlet of Kotcha, 5 miles off. This is a good military position ; it then descends into the plain of the Baluklu Su to 13 K izil Diza ... 15i 160 J Eizil Diza, when it crosses a stream flowing in a hill valley from south-west to north-east to join the Baluklu Su.

The Bayazid road makes a detour to- the north, remaining on level ground from about 5,300 feet above the sea, ascends for the last mile to 14 Bayazid ... 11 1711 Bayazid. This important road is throughout prac ticable for wheeled military transport. It is being improved and relaid out, and is in some places metalled. A line of telegraph runs along the-road, except between Zeidikan and Kara Kilissa. There- are two wires as far as Hassan Kala, where one branches to the right to Mush. The worst part o£ the road is between Delibaba and Zeidikan, but in rainy weather some of the torrents crossed swell up and might be troublesome, and the Passin and Alashkert plains are in places liabe to inundation. The above itinerary is chiefly taken frcm a report by Colo nel Chermside, R.E. The route is well known and is being constantly traversed by Europeans, but most of the traffic turns off at Kizil Diza crossing into Persia.61 tho 0. f ge. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Route No. 36.

They traverse a country very likely to form in the future a theatre of military operations on a great scale, and which, hilly as it is, will as a rule admit of the employment of troops in all directions. This country is but imperfectly known as yet, and only partially surveyed, and it is in some cases difficult to reconcile routes followed by different travellers with each other.

Up to this point the road has been regularly engineered. Artillery might with difficulty be taken over the pass ; it is blocked in winter. Descend gradually south-east over bare, undulating country, to stream running north-east of the Upper Nebi Chai; this is crossed by a ford (2 feet deep in July). Boute continues to Madrakh, a Kurdish village ; supplies very scanty. Over grassy downs, 4 miles to village of Tashkese. A stream running south-west into Upper A raxes.

Route continues past Deniz and Semi in a deep valley, descending to the ford, of the Araxes, 3 feet deep in summer* The river runs in a deep valley. Chauvma (6,645 feet), a small Kurdish village, 1 mile beyond the ford. Route continues south east over spurs for 8 miles to Korsi, where it joins the route from Mejidlu, where it turns south. ^The route crosses a ridge (7,200 feet), the watershed between the A rales and Murad Su valleys, which would make a good position against advance from north, and descends into a fertile valley. Aghveranj a large village, where supplies are abundant. Route runs south, across a level plateau. At 54 miles across deep ravin6 with village and stream, good ford; 2g miles further another ravine; and 2 J miles further, again, descend into another ravine, in which is Khinis Kala.

The stream is considerable, run ning north-east, but is generally fordable here ; it is the boundary between the vikyets of Erzerum and Bitlis. The road now runs south- south-west and crosses a range of hills, ascent steep. The crest (7,700 feet) is passed at about 5 miles, and there is then an easy descent over grass uplands, till it reaches the Murad Su Yalley into which there is a steep descent. Charbukur on the Charbukur Su, which is crossed by a bridge. The route by Allun from Erzerum joins in here. The route now descends the right bank of the Murad Su in a deep, cultivated valley, the river being fordable in some places when low to Sikana, where the valley opens out into the plains of Mush. The route runs for 6 miles over the fertile plains to the bridge over the Murad su. Originally there were 12 stone arches, but now all except three have broken in, and spars take their place ; the roadway, such as it is, is about 10 feet wide. The bridge is about 150 yards long and 30 feet above the water of the river, which is quite unfordable, A little further the route fords the Kara Su and runs on to Mush (4,830 feet). This route is practicable for wheeled guns, although the part between the Palan Dukan pass and Mudrakh is difficult. The track from Delider by Kulli to the bridge over the Araxes is that usually followed, but is about 4 miles longer than that given. The route by Altun is shorter, but not so good. Supplies would be generally obtainable, except between the Araxes and Erzerum ; there is no lack of water, but fuel is very scarce. This report is taken from one by Captain Clayton, R. A., of 1882. The route is one that is much followed by travellers, and is pbout the best from Erzerum to Bitlis; from Khinis Kala the route to Van turns off, passing by Kara Choban to Agantz, and from Kara Choban a route runs southwards to Akhlat, which would also lead to Bitlis, or a mora western route might be taken through Bulanik by Gop.

Near this the route crosses that from Mush to Van south of Lake Van. The route from Bitlis to Mush turns off short of the Khan. The route runs north-east across a level plateau with some ravines approaching the lake to Tadvan, a Christian village of 50 houses on the shore ; good water-supply from a stream. Fire wood is shipped here from the Nimrud Dagh for Van. Route skirts lake by level track, cross one or two spurs of the Nimrud Dagh (8,000 feet high) and reach Khizvak, a village of 60 or 70 houses, cultivation and water. Route continues across an undulat ing plain, high ground on the left receding. Pass villages of Zaag and -Agash, the latter at about 7 miles. Then cross two streams, each about 15 feet wide, and reach the collection of villages extending 2 or 3 miles called Akhlat. The country is well tilled here ; there are gardens^ and plentiful water-supply ; soil good. Akhlat is the seat of a kaimakam, and has a con siderable population ; there are some old fortifi cations A route runs north ; plenty of supplies should be obtainable here. The route continues skirting the lake, and after 2 miles a stream InQ yards wide is ford'-d.

The route now runs inland near the foot of the Sipan Dagh for 5 miles, cr()ssing a promontory to Arinkar. Aftt-r this the route for some distance skirts the lake, a good road, passing Dagh Dagb, and then turn up over the hills to Eksuraf, a Christian village of 1,000 inhabitants. Fruit is grown and supplies are plentiful. From here the route runs over well-cultivated undula tions for 9 miles to Urana, where the Erishat Su is crossed by a bridge 50 yards long and 3 or 4 feet wide, partly stone, partly piles.

This route is generally practicable for arahas, but at certain points guns might find it difficult. The country is, however, generally easy and the road could often be left. Supplies fairly plentiful, and fuel is to be found on the Nimrud Dagh. Near Adeljivas, where the slopes of the Sipan Dagh in places rise direct from the lake, is the worst part of the route. This report is taUen from a reconnaissance by Colonel M. S. Bell, R.E., 1884. The route, turning off north at Akhlat, is that most usually followed from Bitlis to Erzerum, meeting as it does the Erzerum-Van route at Kara Choban. The distance is somewhat less than the route by Mush and Khinis Kala. Moreover, this route from Akblat as far as Gop would generally be followed going from Bitlis to Alash- kert ; beyond Gop the route would be by Melas- gird and the Murad Su Valley. Going from Bitlis to Bayazid on to Igdir the lake shore would probably be followed to Agantz ; and summer the difficult track to Diadin would taken, otherwise it would be necessary to go Peregri. in be to From Peregri the route is the same as No. 29 Bayazid. Agha. Near this village it turns off in a direction W.S.W. and fords the Bend-i-mahi after 3 miles at a difficult place ; the water is generally over 2 feet deep and over 50 yards wide. The route then skirts the Abagha plain, passing some mineral springs and some cultiva tion, with a few scattered villages to Kaehan, a well-built village at the foot of a detach ed hill. All this district is occupied by sedentary Haideranli Kurds ; from here two routes pass into Persia. Then over some swampy meadows to Selakhana village ; then ascend for 5 miles in direction south-west over bare rolling hills, which are traversed, to Guljezin, a hamlet of the Takuri Kurds, in a boggy depression. Then over undulating country passing at some distance Nursha and Chibukli, descending gradually to the level country at the head of the Mermid Su Valley, a stream is crossed after 7 miles. The route now runs due south, and, crossing the gentle hills between the vari ous affluents of the Upper Mermid Su, reaches Sarai, where it crosses the route from Van to Kotur.

This is an important village of the Millan Kurds, with 400 inhabitants, on a stream joining the Kotur Chai at Razi. Then a steep ascent of over 1,700 feet to the Kara Hissar pass (9,100 feet), which forms the watershed between the Kotur Ghai and the Albak Sn, or head of the Zab. Some cultiva tion very high up ; bad going. Then a long but not dilficult descent to 17 Zebkev 14 193| Zerkev, on a small stream joining the Albak Su. From here the route runs south to Deyr on the Albak Su, here already a stream of some size. From here the route runs south-east by the de pression of the A1 ak Su, but receding gradually from from the stream. At first the country is level, intersected by some deep ravines, but becomes more broken after 10 miles, finally there is a slight ascent to 18 Bashkala. 211 Bashkala, This is a considerable detour. The shortest route from Peregri runs direct south-east, meeting that here flescribedin the Mcrmid Su Valley. This reduces the distance to Sarai to about 25 miles. The most direct route from Sarai to Bashkala, but a more difficult one than this, runs by Salan Kala in a branch valley of the Mehmijik Su and avoids the Kotur Chai basin altogether. Except the Kara Hissar pass there is little difficulty at any point between Peregri and Bashkala by the route detailed. Between Peregri and Sarai the country is generally only gently undulaiing ; but there is little eultiy$.t ion and the cold in winter is intense with 6 feet of snow, lasting well into spring.

Reached the foot of the hills by a gentle ascent all the way fvom Suleimania at 4rl5 a.in. and immediately began the ascent, first in the dry bed of a torrent for a few minutes, and then on the steep face of a hill ; at 4-50 a.m. reached the summit by a very steep path. Before us was the plain of Suarojik and Shehr Bazar, terminated on the south by a defile. Our descent was north along the east face of tbo wall-like hill; it took one hour and ten minutes. The rest of our journey was north 50° east. Halted for half an hour at Benawilli; at 7-30 a,ra. descended a steep hill and arrived at the village of Gherradeh. The G-iozeh is the most southern pass that leads over the chain, or wall, of bare hills. Next to it on the north is the Azmir road, which goes to the site of the old city of Kara Choban, and further north is another called the Gavian road. Started at 4 a.m.; our course due east to the hills, or rather mountains. At 4-30 a.m. road north 50° east, on a ridge with a -small dell on the left, and a very deep and large glen on the right. Road gradually ascended. At 5 a.m. we reached the hills at an opening in them ; now descended by a steep road, and kept winding in a defile of the mountains. General direction north 50° east. Road for the rest of the way north 80° east. At 7-20 a m. crossed the Tengazhi River, and ascended by a steep path, which occupied thirty minutes. On our right was the river. The descent, which commenced immediately (for we had crossed a ridge), occupied half an hour, but was more gradual than the ascent.

We now left the mountains, and stretching across the plain, came to a line which branches out east from them. Crossing this we saw a vab through which a river runs ; a similar line of hills bounds it on the other side. Tne river is called Tatan r or the Bistan River. Keeping the mountains we had just crossed on our right we arrived at 7-30 a.m. at Bistan. Bistan lies north 10° east from Ahmed Kulwan, and Banah north 10° east of Bistan, 5 hours. Left Bistan at 5 a.m. and, riding through the plain of Tatan or Bistan, crossed the hills which surround it, and descended into that of Ahmed Kulwan ; crossed jt easterly., and arrived at Panj- win at 9 a.m. From hence Ahmed Kulwan bore north 55° west, distant one hour. Caravans go in 8 days from this to Hamadan and to Sehna in 4 da^ys. Set out at 5 a.m. and at 6 a.m. entered Persia; the Kizilji Hiver soon disappeared to the right, behind the hills that now separate the plain which turns more south. Our crurse hitherto was about south 70® east. Hence to Kai Khosru Beg's tents it bore south. At 9-15 a.m. we arrived in camp. The bare precipices of Avroman bear due south, and extend westward, overlooking Shehriznr, whose plains are separated fiom us by hills which come down from Ahmed Knlwan to Avroman. Between Avroman and Zagros is a narrow valley, through which runs a direct road to Kermanshah. Its direction is south 35° east. The plain of Zagros is bare and high.

Hence north 70° east; at 12-15 p m. north 50° east. At 12-55 p m. we struck out of the high road up a narrow valley, and at 1p.m. arrived at Jenawara. Started at 5-30 a m. and proceeded south 50° east till we reached the road in half an hour. The general direction of road south 80° east. At 6-50 a.m. passed an artificial mount in a narrow valley. After having ascended almost all the way from Jenawara, we descended about a quarter of an hour and arrived at the foot of the descent at 8 a.m. Immediately rose again by a very steep ascent, of whic &gt; we attained ti e summit at 8-30 a.m. The descent was inconsiderable. At 9-10 a.m. arrived at Barodar in a narrow valley. Off at 5-30 a.m., and soon after leaving the village crossed a pretty high hill. Our road all the day wound through very narrow valleys among the hills, through which ran a little stream whose course was easterly. At 8 a.m. we halted, and at 8-40 proceeded on again, and at 9-40 a.m. arrived at the village of Dowizah. Sehna bears south 10° east of Dowizah, and is distant about 12 or 13 miles. The country is more open.
