The complaints centre around their pay, allowances and leave entitlements, following their transfer from Government of India to British Government service under Foreign Office terms and conditions in 1948 (as a result of Indian Independence in 1947). The two petitioners are the subject of the bulk of the correspondence in the file, conducted between: the Political Agent at Kuwait; the Political Resident and his Secretary at the Persian Gulf Residency in Bahrain; and the Establishment and Organisation Department of the Foreign Office in London. Also included in the file is a list of all locally engaged, temporary staff working at the British Political Agencies in Bahrain, Kuwait, Muscat and Sharjah in 1948, showing their name, role, grade, pay and allowances.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office, Establishment and Organisation Department, London</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Kuwait Political Agency</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Abdul Mohsin</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Israel Kadoo</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Personnel</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00016b#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00016b#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
