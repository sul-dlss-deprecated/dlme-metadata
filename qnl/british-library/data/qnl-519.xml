The extract notes that there have been 'irregularities' against the Maritime Treaty committed over time, and that Kemball's has adopted 'the proper course' in these offences. However, the extract notes, Lieutenant Tronson's conduct in proposing the punishment of 'a dozen lashes' to the crew of an offending vessel was inappropriate, and that Tronson was 'properly warned of his error' by Kemball.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051555.0x000030#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
