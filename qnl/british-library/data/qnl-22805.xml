H. B. M!s Political Agent Bahrain. April 8th: 1944 Dear ^V\ fyclu* Ltflcrcu* / Re: TRACHOMA IN BAHRAIN I would be most grateful if you could furnish me with any advice on this subject. I enclose a recent report on the Boys* Schools, as this is the most fruitful area for preventative work. The problem we are up against is the length of time of the treatment, which is extremely stringent and puts the eye out of action for a long time especially as regards school work. MacCallan who spent years in Egypt at this work,and who is the President of the International Organisation against Trachoma, has to confess to slow measures. The schools in Egypt used t© show 98/£ trachoma, most children being infected during the first two years of life. Flies, smoke, dust,over crowding ,purdah and poverty are all factors, and particularly the close proximity of an infected mother with its baby. The home life in the early years of the child is really the source of the trouble. A certain amiunt can be done in the schools to allay the infectious side of the disease. No campaign can be con ceived as yet t© precue* wholesale cures. Propaganda may help. Wakelin has implanted a fair standard of hygiene, and this is all to the good, as certainly personal cleanliness cuts down the trachoma incidence. Can you advise further?

In all schools, the first stage of the disease is most predominant 4 I.E. 44^. , 6. This stage is the most amenable to treatment. 7® This treatment involves 3-6 months unremitting attention mostly by a doctor. 8. The boy would have to be at least 3 months from his school work. 9® There is no Ither alternative treatment.. 10. The question is - how can this be carried out ? 11 ■'V'Trachoma is the biggest scourge of Bahrain. Copies sent to: - er— STATE MEDICAL OFFICER, Bahrain. The Adviser to The Bahrain Govt: The Directer of Education. The Officer-in-charge of The Technical School.no.iofrj - 2 / 19 . Political Agency, Bahrain, 12th April 1944. Thank you very much for your letter regarding Trachoma. 2. I have two suggestions to make and they are as followss- (a) That you start special treatment centres for all boys with Trachoma attending school during the vacation which I believe lasts in the simmer for about two months. This should enable you to at least check the disease in advanced cases and possibly in early infections effective cure. Naturally you know more about this matter than I do but you have asked for my advice. (b) That every endeavour be made to exclude flies from the school buildings. At the present time in a good many of the schools no effort whatever is being made and in particular at Suq-al-Khamis the children*s eyes are a disgusting sight. Al though wire-gauze may not be available fishing net is,and small meshed net stcetched across windows is effective in excluding flies from the room especially if you make full use of the supplies of Flit and Imshi which are now available in the town. 3lreat the children*s eyes during the holidays and prevent fresh infections during the school year.
