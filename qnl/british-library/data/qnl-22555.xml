I think it will mean a saving if we get the pants and coats made in Karachi but before placing an order I would like a comparison of the costs between Karachi and Bahrain. The tailoring charges (as quoted by Messrs. Gangaram) amount to approximately &amp; 8/8 for a coat and pant assuming that 3^ yards will be required for a suit, see Please^how much on the average we have been paying to our Agency tailor. If Karachi is cheaper, please say how many pants and coats will be required and also send complete measurements for each. If making the pants and coats in Karachi is not worth while, we shall buy the cloth alone in Karachi. 10/9/41 The farrashes use their clothing eo roughly that the tailor thinks sample 'A* would not last long* They get winter clothing once in three years and therefore he recommends sample which appears thicker and stronger# We have been paying Rs*9/- per suit^ Rs#6/- for coat and Rs.3/- for a pair of trousers* The tailor (Fazal 1 Mohammad) who has been 9 according to him, preparing the kxs liveries in the Agency for the last 14 yearsy says will ' A* charge eight annas less than Karachi i*e« he will stich one suit for Rs.8/- as compared with Rs*8/8 at Karachi.
