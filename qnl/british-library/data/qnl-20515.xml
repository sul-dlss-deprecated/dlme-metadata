Ho. 1948 Ify dear Colonel, I wtite to confirm our conversation regarding t3ae impending despatch of a Geologist (G.M.Lees, M.C., IKP.G.) to Maskat territory in accordance with the D f Arcy Explorat- -ion Company's Agreement of May 18 1925. It is intended that Lees should leave Muhammerah 'by slow mail on October 11th arriving at Maskat about October 18th. I will wire the precise date as soon as possible. We should like him to proceed from Muscat Horth- -wards to Sohar, and as much beyond that place as possible making excursions Westwards wherever conditions admit to the coastal range. We hope to send a Mohamedan surveyor of the Survey of India with him who will also make a rough re- -connaissance along the route taken on 1/4 inch scale: he will, if need be, be left behind after Lees has gone on elsewhere, to complete a 1/4 inch survey of such areas as m are accessible. I believe Arban knows this district, at all event! as far as Sohar: if he could be retained at Muscat until Lees' arrival and could accompany him on his northern trip I as far as and including Masandam we would gladly meet the cost of his salary for the period involved - about two months and all his travelling expenses would of course be paid. Could you see your way to suggest this to the Government of India 7 WhenWhen Lees has got as far Horth as he can he should either charter a dhow and go up the coast to Malcoifem \! and Eltihinstone Inlets, or should return to Sohar or Maskat and charter a dhow thence. If any of H.M's. ships are available and could without inconvenience ferry him to Malcolm or Elphinstone Inlets we should of course be very grateful. If conditions admit we should like him to cross the Mas and am Massif from Dibah to Fujairah Shinas or Sohar ■ - but this need not be arranged for at the moment: we should however, be much obliged if you could collect any informat- -ion re current political conditions for our guidance when the time comes. May we also ask you to be so good as to arrange for hired transport for the party from Maskat Horthwards; mules for riding and camels or donkeys for kit. I will wire precise composition of the party and amount of trans- -port required later. I presume that H.H. the Bultan will provide all necessary guards on payment by us under Article 7, 2nd schedule of the Agreement. As regards Bhofar. I understand from you that H.M.S.''Triad' would be leaving Bombay for Dhofar about January 11th and that you would ask the S.H.O. to be so good as to permit Lees to go in her to Dhofar with his party - viz. Indian surveyor, interpreter, and probably 2 or 3 servants. Wb We would probably leave the surveyor at Dhofar to make a 1/4 inch reconnaissance of such parts of the hinter- -land as are accessible and return to Maskat in the ^Triad' after a cursory examination of the locality. Should he find it necessary to stay longer we would send a tanker to pick him up later. Am3 As regards M aslrah . We have received,as you know, vague reports of oil shows in this locality; it is of great importance to us and to H.H. the Sultan that it should he examined;as explained hy you the local trihes do not at present owe allegiance to the Sultan : if it were possible for arrangements to be made hy you with H.H. the Sultan and the Haval, Civil and the S.N.O. for £ees to examine this locality cursorily - the 'Triad' lying off the mainland whilst he is doing so - it would he of immense assistance to us and would he deeply appreciated. I can see no other way at present of getting this locality examined. The discovery of oil would he of such import- -ance however alike to ourselves, to the State of Muscat and to H.II's. Government that 1 hope the authorities may see their way to lend us assistance in the direction indi cated• These two trips, Muscat-Masandam, and Bomhayf -Dhofar-Masirah, will conclude our programme this year so far as Maskat territory is concerned. I am writing to you separately as regards Lees' subsequent movements. Please treat this letter as official should you so desire. I enclose three spare copies, one of which I would ask you to be so good as to send ataonut to Thomas. with renewed thanks for the assistance given and promised to us in connection with our examination of Maskat territory.

Date b CONFIDENTIAL HfOOflM. l&amp; Sep t&gt; 11th .19,25.. j,5y dear Colonel, On his return from Dhofar ure should like Lees to visit the Giatar peninsular crossing at least once from west to east or east to west preferably at its higheat point. The immediate object of this examination is not so much to ascertain whether or not we desire to apply for a concession in Qatar, as to which we have had previous correspondence with your office, as to correlate the geology on the southern side of the Gulf with the known facts as to the geological conditions on the Persian side. Should it transpire as a result of these investigations in Qatar, or elsewhere on the Arab coast that geological conditions are such as to warrant the expenditure of money on prospecting or in sinking wells, we should, of course, make application in the usual way We are also very desirous that Lees should visit the islands along and of the Trucial coast in-L . 1.1,....5..,...,.19.25 -2- 1 including Hafeul, Sibu Haair, Dalmah and Yas, and if by any means possible we should like him to make a cursory inspection of the outstanding geological features along the coast itself, e.g. at Khorfi-Al-Odaid and the hills south of Yas island, and i in the neighbourhood of Abu Dhabi. It will be very difficult for him to do this without j the assistance from one of His liajesty's ships, and I write, not without much diffidence, to ask you to be so good as to approach the S.I.O. when next you meet him personally (i.e. next December) with a view to ascertaining whether it would be possible for him, consistently with the exigencies of the service, to send Lees to • visit some or all of these places on one of H.M's ships after his return from Dhofar, that is to say about the middle of February. Some of these places mentioned are probably difficult of access for a man of war, and the S.H.O. may not wish to ex pose his picket boats or crews with the risk of inconvenience of frequent landings. To overcome this we should, of course, be very willing to charter a small native dhow which could perhaps ■ be towed around for landing purposes with a native crew so long as required. You will realise, of course, that I put this suggestion ■forward without any knowledge as to how far, if at all, it would(p ) ...19.25. would appeal to Captain Leip or his successor. He may wish V to defer answering till he has had met Lees, n We have, of course, no concessional rights over Qatar or the Tnicial coast, and have already explained that our primary object in making this examination is to correlate the geology of the Trucial coast with that of the Persian side of the Gulf. If, however, we should find that conditions justify it we should, of course, apply in the ordinary way for concessions. Whether there is any reasonable prospect of oil being found or not it would doubtless be very inconvenient for His Majesty's Government to be confronted by an application for a concession from some Company not wholly British, or not approved of by the Colonial Office, ^ Yours sincerely.

It appears to me that your sending a geologist i anywhere outside the limits of J&amp;iscat State would practically I amount to your taking the advantages of what is termed an 'Exploration License', without the same having been granted by the Arab Chief concerned. If this view is correct,it seems to me that the Colonial Office will have to be consulted as to whether the , Arab Chiefs concerned should be approached regarding the passage of your party without a proper Oil Concession being first negotiated with each one on the lines of the Muscat Concession. 1 fully appreciate the endless delay which would be occasioned if we were to try to get separate con- -oeseions from each and all of the petty chiefs concerned. If the Secretary of State for the Colonies rules that regular concessions are required from each Chief, will you then be prepared to undergo the trouble of getting these petty concessions ? The r A. T. Wilson, K .C.l .E. , etc., General Manager, Messrs. The Anglo-Persian Oil Coy., Ltd., Muhamraerah.2 The same conditions appear to apply to your proposals regarding qatar, and here again, a proper concession involving an Exploration License would appear to be necessary before your geologist enters that tract because, when all is said and done, the travelling of your geologist through that territory in reality and technically amounts to 'exploration'. If you do not intend pressing matters to the extent of procuring concessions perhaps you will be willing to allow these expeditions to lapse ? Alban is very keen to accompany Lees in his Muscat trip and 1 am approaching the GoTernment of India about this. Alban considers your proposals regarding iiasirah quite feasibly and anticipates no difficulty regarding Bhofar.'4 T-l 'kl. + COS FIPEHTIAL . D. 0.

There is no reason to think that Lees will not be able, whilst on the Trucial Coast, to keep confidential the object of his enquiries. He is a keen naturalist and entomologist, and he will have attached to him a collector of the Bombay Natural History Society, formerly employed by Major Cheesman on behalf of Sir P. 2. Cox. He could do almost all that he required, except in the Masandam and Qatar peninsulas from a ship without going inland. If it were possible for Alban to accompany lees along the Trucial Coast we should of course be glad to pay his salary: he would obtain some useful experience and could perhaps obtain informa tion of value to the Sovernment of India.

He mentions that similar reconnaissances were made in Bahrain and ^uwait before the war 'by his Company; also that Eastern and General Syndicate were allowed to visit oil show in Kuwait. He urges that so much permission may be granted before question of Exploration License is considered. He thinks that object of visit can even be camouflaged as geologist will be accompanied by naturalist- -entomologist. I am decidedly of opinion that no Trucial Chief^ at present will consider any grant of license; also that most j of them will refuse permission to walk inland. Examination of islands can easily be made; also possibly a march along the coast and even across Qatar. Manager knows that negotiations for lease in Qat a r must not be initiated. If H.M's. Government accept the view that these journeys can be made without reference to the Chiefs for license, I will endeavour to arrange, for the journey across m Musandam at once.

Secret- -ary of State for the Colonies, London, a copy of which was submitted by post to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department under Residency endorsement Mo. 392 -S., dated the 23rd October 1925. / /f i' * &amp; i y 2. The Right Hon'ble Mr. Aery's reply (copy now attached), was received on the 16th December 1925. 3. I had a short time previously heard from the Hesidency Agent, Shargah, that on their way down to Muscat, three geologists of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company — Messrs. Lees, Gray and Williamson — had visited Shargah on the 19th October in the Company's steamer 'Khuzistan', which, I understand, also landed a consignment of kerosine oil there. The geologists proceeded in this vessel to Has el Khaimah and Khasab (Muscat territory, at the foot of the Ruus al ^ a ^ ai massif ). In Bas el Khaimah, with the Shaikh's permission, they spent one day visiting the foothills. At2 8. At KhasalD, whither they took a son of the Residenny Agent, they spent three days and climed in various directions. (* The ♦'Khuzistan' then proceeded direct to Muscat, where the geologists spent ten days 'before they coimnenced touring in the Sultan's district of Batineh, accompanied by Captain Eccles, who was deputed 'by His Highness 1 Government to take care of them. 4. Before addressing the Government of India in accordance with the instructions contained in the Colonial Office telegram, I decided to visit the Trucial Coast and C^atar myself in order to discuss matters personally with the Residency Agent and to see for myself the attitude of Shaikh Abdallah 'bin Jasim of Qatar. 5. I 'beg now to submit the following observations and views. Yrucial Coast . 6. It is impossible for any European to land and start on a journey of exploration in any 4jf the Chief ships without the previous consent and support of this Residency. Probably the only non -official Europeans who have slept a night ashore on this coast in the last century are Medical American Missionaries and commercial or shipping Agents who have been recommended to the Residency Agent. Mone of such persons can at present obtain permission to live on the Coast. 7. The Residency can obtain the Shaikh's consent to Geologists making excursions —- say of 30 or 40 miles —- into the interior H in order to correlate the geology on the 'southern side of the Gulf with the known facts as to the geological conditions on the Persian side H , but there is no likelihood at present of any of the six chiefs issuing to any one an Exploration License in connection with a concess- -ion to bore for oil.8. With regard to the Islands, which are nearly all uninhabited, the position is different. As in the case of Abu Musa and its red oxide concession, the Chief concerned will probably jump at any proposal for a concession. 9. Until the probablf existence of oil in any part of the mountainous Ruus al Jabal has been discovered under the Muscat Government's concession it does not seem likely that the minds of the Trucial Chiefs will be disturbed by propos- -als from either the Anglo-Persian Oil Company or the Eastern and General Syndicate, which is now installed at Bahrain. Qatar . 10. The potentialities of oil here seem greater. The conformation of the peninsula may not be dissimilar from that of Bahrain. I have been told by Major Holmes, the Syndic- -ate's Agent and Engineer, that artesian wells can probably be sunk in Qatar as successfully as in Bahrain. 11« I saw Shaikh Abdallah bin Jasim on the 9th January. He told me that he had had no cause to complain against Ibn Baud's Governor of Hasa during the past year and that he was in friendly correspondence with His Highness. IShen I mooted the question of the geologists walking over his country t his only scruple was on the score of security. I think that this, when the time comes, will probably be arranged satisfactorily. 12* As regards the bringing into H^iKxsdctoK effect of the partial operation of Article VII of the Treaty of 1916, 1 gathered that the Shaikh was still averse to having Hindus in his jurisdiction. This is because he is, himself, the chief pearl dealer in Qatar and he does his business with India through an Arab merchant in Bahrain. He does not welcome the competition of Hindus. 13. If the Chief should ever come to an agreement with an4 an Oil Exploration Company there is no douM that not only Article VII but also Articles VIII and IX of the Treaty will of the results of the visit which the Anglo-Persian Oil Company contemplate making next month to Dohat al Bida'. The fact that Ibn Saud has given the Eastern and General Syndicate an oil concession right up to the southern border of Qatar and has materially assisted them to obtain the Bahrain concession is likely, I think, to influence Shaikh Abdallah in favour of the ^riglo-Persian Oil Company. 14.

Sir, I am directed by the Secre tary of State for India to say that be bas bad under bis consideration tbe correspondence in connection witb tbe agreement between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and tbe Sheilch of Qatar, copies of which were forwarded under your letter of 18th October, No.98116/32. 2. Under Article 7 of the Treaty of 3rd November 1916 between the Sheikh of Qatar and His Majesty's Government the Sheikh is precluded from granting any monopolies or concessions 'to anyone whomsoever. «•••• •without the consent of the jlj.gh British Governiuent 11 ■ For the reasons given below i^ix SaKme 1 Hoare is in favour of the grant of formal approval to the agreement now under consideration. But he weald suggest that (\\ the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, in conveying to the Sheikh approval of it, should remind him of the terms of Article V of his Treaty and should make it clear that he is not in a position to grant any concessions save with tbe consent cf His Majesty's Gcvernment, and should suggest that he woxld be well advised in future to inform the local political authorities before actually entering into any such agreement. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company might also perhaps be informed demi-officially of the position and advised in their own interests to keep the local political authorities and His Majesty's Government in close touch with any action they may wish to take with a view to obtaining fresh oil concessions here or elsewhere in the Arab Principalities of tie Persian Gulf. 3. Sir Samuel Hoare, as Sir Philip Gunliffe-Llster is m\ aware, attaches Importance to securing that any concessioi taken Uader-Secretary' of State, out/ Colonial Office, S. W. 1.5./ out in this area shall not be of a merely blocking nature, but that the concessionaire shall definitely intend to develop tlB field, ani that the terms shall be reasonable frcm tlB point of view of the Sheikh. He is broadly speaking c£ opinion that exception need not be taken to the present agreement on either of these grounds. The one question of importance which then arises is the extent to #iich consideration needs to be gjvm.. to. the fact that the Eastern axxi General.. Syndic ate are known to have displayed a certain interest in the question at securing an oil concession in Qatar# The Secretary of State appreciates the delicate nature of the position in regard to the Government of the United States of America as regards oil deposits in the Gulf. In the present case, however,- ; 'the exclusive right which has been granted to explore for oil fcr two years is expressed as a renewal and extension of a previous permit; the Eastern and General Syndicate have shown no signs of following up the tentative enquiries which appear to have been made by them, ) the agreement itself is one yfcich may be regarded as suitable from the point of view of the Sheikh; and ths Secretary of State is of opinion, therefore, that, quite apart from the general desirability of securing exploitation of these deposits, if they exist, by a British Company such as the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, there is no obligation on His Majesty's Government to withhold approval frcm the exploration licence now granted on the chance that the Eastern aixl General Syndicate might desire to compete. Difficulty ought not, in his vlaw, to be anticipated in furnishing any necessary explanatiai on these lines to the United States Government, if any representations in the matter should be received from that Government.5 # On a minor but important point, the grant of any such concession to a fcreign company direct or through the Eastern and General Syndicate, would clearly make it of great importance that mail arrangements at Qatar should be under British control; that some arrangement as regards jurisdi ction over, and the protection, of foreigners should be negotiated between His Majesty^ Government and the Sheikh, and, probably, that seme local representative of His Majesty 1 s Governaient should be appointed. If hOY^ver approval, as now suggested, is given to tte agreement negotiated between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Sheikh, the matter will be of less immediate importance, and Sir Samel Hoare would agree generally wiiii the Resident 1 3 vie?/ that it would be unnecessary formally to draw His Ssoellency 1 s attention to iorticles 7II f 7111 aM IX of the Treaty of 1916. 6.

Dear Flood, With reference to the draft despatch to the Politiccti Resident Persian Gulf, concerning oil concessions in the ^ Persian Gulf, enclosed with your letter of 5th October, 1932, the Admiralty have the following observations to offer i- (i) In view of the fact that the agreement between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Sheikh of qatar has actually been concluded, the Admiralty presume that paragraph 2 of the draft will either be deleted or drastically altered. (ii) As pointed out in Admiralty letter M. 01686/32, paragraph 7, to which no objection was raised at the Meeting on 15th September, the Admiralty attach the greatest importance to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company bringing the Persian Gulf area within their sphere of control. In view of this fact and the discussion which took place at the Meeting, the Admiralty feel that paragraph 3 of the draft hardly reflects the opinion of the Meeting and therefore suggest that this paragraph should read ♦♦On general and strategic grounds it would.^but it is always necessary, for reasons of international|policy, that each application should be handled with great care and that no excuse should be given for an accusation against His Majesty f s Government of unfair treatment.

The Hon'ble the Political Resioent in the Persian G-ulf, Bushire. Sir, 1] I have the honour to refer to the fifth paragraph of I»Ir.Walton's letter No:P.Z.7118/32 dated the 1st jYnuuy' (which formed an enclosure to your Printed Letter No:77-S dated the Hard January 1933) regarding the Agreement between the Anglo- Persian Oil Company .uimited and the Shaikh of Qatar,and to our conversation an the subject of the 8th February 1933. 2. It seems that His Majesty's Government contemplate the possibility of having to establish,even if not immediately,a c onsiderable measure oi control over Qatar. The suggestion nas far reaching implications (for example,how far we should be prepared to carry our protection of Qatar in the event of hostilities between Sa'udi Arabia and Qatar)and would need care ful examination before any action was taken. 3. To some extent the matters touched on in Mr.Walton's letter are governed by the terms of the Treaty with Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim Qatar dated the 3rd-November 1916,and the subsidiary letter of the same date from the Hon'ble the Political (2)(3) Resident to Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim. 4. In the meantime,the presence of the explorers of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited,and the possibility that prospecting may follow,mean that,whether it is agreeable to us or not,our relations with Qatar must become closer and our responsibilities in various directions will increase. 5. I feel,therefore,that it is of importance for me to visit Qatar from time to time and to endeavour to establish friendly personal relations between myself and the Shaikh before I am called upon either to enter into negotiations for objects which cannot but be distasteful to him,or to help,or settle matters arising out of, the operations of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company Limited. I shall be assisted to some extent by the fact that I have already met Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim al T'hani in the far past: indeed,! was present at the final handing over of the Treaty,but I am anxious to pay him more than one* visit,at fairly long intervals,without demanding anything from him. 6. I regard it,moreover,as essential that,in the beginning at any rate,my visits should be paid in a leisurely and dignified manner on board one of His Majesty's Ships. Indeed,though I fully appreciate the value of air travel and the courtesy of the Royal Air Porce in placing Flying Boats at the disposal of the Political Agent,I fear that,owing to the hasty circumstances in which the request for the use of a landing ground at Dohah was made and to the consequent rebuff which was administered to us,it would handicap me from the outset,if I were to travel to Qatar by air. The Senior Naval Officer was kind enough to say tnat he would try to arrange for me to go there in a Sloop,and I request that,if there is no objection,he may be asked to do so in the near future. 7. I have already paved the way for a visit by taking .. Shaikh Abdullah a suitable opportunity of recalling to iaaa the pleasant occasion4 0 3. on which I met him in Qatar before; and he has replied that he too remembers it and hopes that I will pay him another visit.

Haji Williamson ained with me on the night of the 3rd March 193 .3 and told me that affairs were proceeding satisfactorily in Qatar. He,however,told me that Shaikh Abdullah had refused to allow them 10 use their wireless set. He (Haji Williamson) had explained to the Shaikh that it was part of tneir equipment just as were their tents and motor cars. The Shaikh was,however,adamant,saying that ne nad just refused a request of the Government inspite of tue fact that Oflicers nad come to make it and that he could not exceed to a somewhat similar request from a Company. 3. As it happened,some thing occurred a few days later, and the Shaikh asked if they would send a wireless message to Bahrain for him. They,however,replied tnat the wireless set nad oeen packed up and sent away and the Shaikh's son rounded on uis lather and said 'you see what a convenience you nave lost through your refusing permission to use wireless' J. 3. This is a petty matter but it may interest you to xnow it as it supports our view that it is foolish to 'rush' matters in places like Qatar.

Please refer to oorrespondence ending with your letter Ko. 72-D, dated 20th May 1933, regarding your pro- -posal to send Hajl Williamson to the Shaikh of Qatar to prepare the ground for coauuencing negotiations for an oil ooncassion. 2. I agree that this method of approach is the most suitable. 1 do not consider it necessary to seek the prior approval of H.M's. Governaent for this prelimit- -ary step and authorise you to send Mr. tilliamson. 3. In order to emphasise the principle that the Shaikh should not enter into any discussions without the prior approval of the Political Hesident I think it desirable that Mr. Williamson should carry a letter from me to the Shaikh. 1 enclose a translation of the communication I propose to send. It is of an informal nature and 1 do not think it will render the Shaikh nervous or aby of entering into negotiations later. The original will he sent to the Political Agent, Bahrain, for Mr, Williamson to pick up. I note that the draft you propose to present to the Bhaikh later will he on the lines of that presented at Kuwait. I think, however, that the general approval of H.k's.

Sir, 4°' nc /V With reference to correspondence ending with my telegreon Ho.12, of date, I haTe the honour to sub mit the following ohserrations on the draft agreement 'between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited and the Shaikh of Qatar. Article 1 « This comhines the rights of exploration, prospecting, and mining instead of the rights at each stage being specified in separate Schedules. Article 2 . The agreement contains no provision for the selection and specification of limited areas for mining purposes. Article 3 « The agreement contains no provision obliging the Company to commence drilling operations within a specified period, or to declare within a specified period that oil has been found in commercially exploitable quantities. In this connection I would invite attention to the view expressed in paragraph 3 of India Office letter Ko.^.2.7118/32, dated the let December 1932, to the Colonial Office,/ Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies, The Colonial Office, LOroOHeOffice, that any concession taken out in this area should not be of a merely f 'bloclcing , nature® The necessity for the insertion of such provisos will, however, to some extent, depend on the payments which are agreed on under Article 4 # Ayticle 4, Mr. Hkington has informed me that the Company is unable at present to furnish parti culars of the payments conteiaplated under this Article as these are a matter for negotiation. Article 10. This provides for the enjoyment throughout the period of the concession of the privilege of exemption from customs duty. The privilege is also wider than that enjoyed 'by the Bahrain ^etroleum Company under the Bahrain Oil Con cession of 19S5 in that it covers 'furniture, foodstuff and clothing' required for the use of the Company's empldyees, ^ytiqle 1^» This confers the right of assignment to any Company, irrespective of its nationality, ahle to fulfil the duties and obligations of the agreement. I presume that it will not he possible to insist on the insertion of a 'British Nationality' clause in the terns of paragraph 3 of Colonial Office despatch No. Confidential A, dated the 19th June 1928, in view of the fact that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited are bound to assign the eoncession,/concesBion, when obtained, to the 'Iraq Petroleum Company ( vide your telegram No.5, dated the 86th May 1933) which, though technically a British Company registered in Great Britain, is owned by .American, French, and Butch intereets as well. I presune that the draft agreement will he scrutinised in detail by the ''etroleum department and note from your telegram Mo.5 of 86th May 1933 that the Anglo- Persian Oil Company Limited have been informed that the question of 'safeguards* will need consideration.

Pinal record of a meeting held on 26th toy 1933, In Mr. Parkinson's room, Colonial Office. The following were present Mr. Parkinson ... (in the Chair) Mr. Rendel ) Mr. Warner ) ... Foreign Office. Mr. Starling ... Petroleum Department. Commander Hivett-Camac Admiralty. Mr. Grombie ... India Office. Mr. Blaxter ... colonial Office. Mr. Heam ... Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Die meeting was called together to consider the situation which has arisen in connection with an application hy Mr. Sampson, an official of the Iraq Petroleum Company seconded to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, for permission to visit Qatar. Mr. Heam stated that Sir John Cadman, during his recent visit to Persia, had made a careful study of the position in the Persian Gulf, and had come to the conclusion that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company would he well advised to go ahead at once and negotiate an oil concession with the Shaikh of i^atar. Ihey had, therefore, decided to send out Mr. Sampson to open negotiations with the Shaikh, and he was at present held up at Abadan owing to the intervention of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Mr. Heam explained that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company were only acting as agents of the Iraq Petroleum Company in this matter. The ^atar area cams within the agreement made between the various constituent groups of the Iraq Petroleum Company and by that agreement each/each group had undertaken not to seek concessions individually in certain areas which included Qatar. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company could not, therefore, take up a concession themselves. They proposed, however, in agree ment with the Iraq Petroleum Company, to obtain the concession in their own name, and then assign it to the Iraq Petroleum Company. He thought that if the Anglo- Persian Oil Company did not move quickly there was danger that Major Holmes and his associates would forestall them and obtain a concession for American interests. He was anxious to avoid the same situation arising in Qatar as had arisen in Kuwait. Mr. Rendel observed that His Majesty's Government had originally thought that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company were seeking a concession for themselves, and he pointed out that the fact that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company were merely acting on behalf of the Iraq Petroleum Company made it desirable, in his opinion, that His Majesty's Goverrment should consider at once what their position was in the light of this new information. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company were an all-British concern, whereas the Iraq Petroleum Company, though it was registered in Great Britain, was an international concern. While the Foreign Office would certainly raise no objection to the Iraq Petroleum Company obtaining the concession, there had been a good deal of difficulty in the past about non-British concepis obtaining oil concessions in the Persian Gulf, and it woula be unfortunate if, after His Majesty's Government had agreed to Mr. Sampson negotiating a concession with the Sheikh with full knowledge that the concession was to go to the Iraq Petroleum Company difficulties were subsequently to be raised over, for instance, such questions as the so-called 'safeguards'. Mr. Starling/Ml t Stai'!Ing said, that as far as tHe Petroleum Depart ment was concerned, he saw no objection to Mr. Sampson hetag allowed to proceed to Qatar and negotiate with the Shaikh for the concession. It would he most unfortunate if iajor Holmes were allowed to extend the sphere of his activities to Qatar. Commander Hivett-temac enquired whether the Anglo- Persian Oil Company could not invite the Burma Oil Company to take up the concession. Mr. Hearn . however, said that this would he out of the question, as it would he regarded by the Iraq Petroleum Company as a breach of faith. Compgrnw fiivett-Carnac then stated that if it was impossible for an all-British Company to have the concession, he thought that the Admiralty would undoubtedly regard the Iraq Petroleum Company as preferable to the American interests working with Major Holmes. Mr. Hearn was asked whether a copy of the draft concessin which Mr. Sampson was taking with him could be supplied to His Majesty's Government. Mr. Hearn explained that certain alterations would very likely be made locally in the draft which was sent out from London. He was, however, quite agreeable to the Political fiesident asking for a copy from the local General Manager of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The meeting agreed that a telegram should be sent iffifflediately to the Political Hesident, inforniing him that, unless there were other objections of which they were not aware, His Majesty's Government saw no reason why Mr. Sampson should not proceed to Qatar. It was explained to Mr. Hearn mat His Majesty's Government would wish to advise upon the draft concession in the same way as they had offered their advice to ttie Siaikh of Kuwait in connection with the drafts for a concession in that territory. At the same time mention was made of the safe guards which His Majesty's Government wished to see inserted ^ oil concessions granted to non-British companies over areas in/in the Persian Gulf. Ihsse were part of a proposed change of policy for allowing foreign controlled oil companies to operate in British Territory, which had been discussed in general terms with sir Jonn Cadman and other British oil interests am accepted by them. But if applied in the case of the Iraq Petroleum Company, Mr. Hearn was apprehensive that th-ere would he serious difficulty with the foreign groups of the Iraq Petroleum Company, in particular the French. He mentioned that no such safeguards had been required in the case of the Iraq Petroleum Company's concession in Iraq, it was, however, pointed out to him that conditions in Iraq were not the same as in the Persian Gulf and that the whole circumstances in that case were different. Commander Rivett-Carnac tentatively expressed the opinion that the Admiralty might prefer the Iraq Petroleum Company to have the concession, even without the safeguards - although he had thought that the Company snould find no difficulty in accepting them - rataer than that the concesston should go to purely .American interests even with safeguards. It was agreed that nothing coula be settled in regard to this matter at the present time, but that the question of safeguards would have to be considerea further at a subsequenti stage, and that as Mr. iiearn was now aware of the possible demand for safeguards, there ras no occasion to send any written conmmication to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company on the subject.CONFIDENTIAL.

I took an opportunity on another occasion of advising Mr.Sempson to keep clear of the Western coast of Qatar,so far as might be.

'he ^rench, in particular, might see considerable difficulty about any right of pre-euiption in the event of war. 7. I said that, while I did not know what had taken place in the previous discussions, it v/as only fair to say that, so far as could be judged, the question of safeguards in respect of the Q^atar area was likely t o be of great import- arce. Having regard to the position of the Shaikh, his treaty commitments and possible difficulties about juris diction, it would be unfair to hold out any hope that they were likely to be easy to surmount. A different position might arise, indeed, if the A-P.O.C. v/ere to develop the Qatar concession, foreign companies having a distributing interest only and all personnel, etc. being British.

It will be necessary to provide a safeguard m respect of this. Article We should agree with the Resident s views# Article/ Starling Esq.*, Petroleum Department, Mines Department, Dean Stanley Street,S»W.1-Article 6« The wording of this Article seems very extensive and I think it would he desirable to make some provision to safeguard the rights of the Sheikh or limit those of the Company under it# Article 7* The first sub-paragraph is very wide indeed in its terms. As regards the second sub-paragraph there ought, I should have thought, to 'be some provision to safeguard a little more than the draft does the rights of occupiers# Article 8. In iine 4, after the words 'area and' I should he disposed to insert 'subject to the same proviso'. Article 9. A similar proviso to that contained in Article 8 seems desirable# Article 10* We should, I think, quite agree with the Political Resident 1 s criticism of this Article as it stands# We might grant exemption from customs duties for not more than 10 years in the first instance (this was a point which gave rise to considerable difficulty at an earlier stage in connection with the draft concessions submitted by the Anglo- Persian Oil Company in respect of Bahrein and Koweit), leaving it to the Company to raise the matter again shortly before the expiry of that period in the light of experience*/experience^ I do not think there is any case at this stage for a longer exemption. I also agree that it is not reasonable that furniture, food stuff, and clothing required for the use of the Company 1 s employees should 'be exempted. Some provision may also he desirable in respect of harbour dues, etc# Article 11» This is, again, stated in very general terms and will probably require modification. Article 18. We should, I think, entirely agree with the Admiralty as to the desirability of pressing for a British Nationality Clause* We should also agree as to the desirability of considering safeguards to cover pre-emption, refining, etc. If the Company is to have the right of forming one or more subsidiary companies for the working of the concession, the agreement should specifically provide that the terms (including British control, &amp;c.) on which such subsidiary companies are to be formed, etc# shall be subject to the prior approval of His Majesty^ Government and of the Sheikh. Article 15* Sub-paragraph 1. It is for consideration whether the Company should not be made specifically liable to make/4* make good any damage in the event of its removing its buildings, etc. Article 15. In the interests of the Sheikh I think there ought to be some provision that the question whether or not the delay on the part of the Company is satisfactory should be subject to the approval of e#g* the Political Resident. Article 16. There is something to be said for eliminating this elaborate provision for arbitration and leaving any matter in dispute to the arbitration of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. We will look at the agreement more closely, but I think it well to send these provisional notes at once.

The Shaikh originally requested us to return our representative to Qatar on about the 10th October, but now that H.M's Ships are visiting him on 13th October I feel that it would be advisable for us not to aonear on the scene until his naval visitors have left. So Chisholm will probably leave Bahrein for Qatar about the 15th, depending on the news our clerk brings from the Shaikh and any advice received from you. I trust that you are keeping fit after such a strenuous summer, and that I may have the pleasure of making your acquaintance at some not too distant date. / Yours sincerely. Lieut-Col.

If you desire us to alter these arrangements in any way we shall be obliged if you will inform us accordingly. Mr. Chisholm will call on the Political Agent on arrival in Bahrein.

ADMIEALTY, S.I. 29th September, 1933 M. 02517/33. My dear Laithwaite, y 9 uv' May I refer to Warner's letter E,4794/156/91 of the 29th August, dealing with the Qatar oil concession 2. In view of the difficulties which have arisen, we have thought it desirable to attempt to expound more fully what the Admiralty had in mind when our official letter M.02064/33, dated 14th August, was written. 3. In the case of Bahrein, it was proposed that the following clauses which now appear in the concession should be perpetuated in the Mi ning Lease:- (1) The Assignee Company is to be registered in Great Britain or Canada. (2) The Company's office in Great Britain is to be in charge of a British subject. (3) One director of the Assignee Company is to be persona grata to H .M. Government. (4) The local representative is to be approved by H.M. Government. (5) As many employees of the Assignee Company as possible are to be British, or subjects of the Sheikh of Bahrein. In addition we proposed that the lessees should enter into certain covenants based on the Model Mining Lease; in brief, they should erect a refinery and that the Sheikh should have rights to pre-empt the oil and take control of the works, etc., in war. 4. With regard to Qatar, the Admiralty, recognising that the concession must be assigned to the Iraq Petroleum/ Laithwaite, Esq., India Office, S.W.I.8./ Petroleum Company, proposed that safeguards to prevent a further assignment to a non-British Company should be inserted, together with the remaining safeguards for British interests on the model of Bahrein. The idea was, therefore, to apply the precedent of Bahrein, modified only so far as is essential because of the assignment to the Iraq Petroleum Company. 5. The logical consequence, therefore, is to amend the concession now under discussion in such a manner as to permit the assignment to the Iraq Petroleum Company, but to foroid further assignment, to any company which does not come within all the restrictions given in paragraph 3 above. 6. Should, however, the Anglo-Persian Oil Co. dislike the idea of writing all of the safeguards into the concession at this stage, we should regard it as important not to press the point too hard. American interests have already secured Hasa and Bahrein and may also secure Koweit, and we are therefore anxious to avoid still further American penetration and do not wish to frighten the Iraq Petroleum Company out of Qatar. 7. We should therefore suggest the following as a second line of defence ) 1^3 (l) Article 12 of the draft concession to be amended to provide that, in the event of assignment by the Iraa Petroleum Company, the Assignee Company should be registered in Great Britain or Canada, and that the terms of any assignment should be submitted for the approval of the Sheikh. (2) When the draft Assignment is received, efforts to be made to include in it as many cf the safeguards mentioned above as may be possible, having regard to the constitution of the Assignee Company,8. I trust this letter will make our position clear. 9. I am sending a copy to Eendel of the Foreign Office. lours sincerely, (Sgd). E.A. SEAL. ff[, / ^ w' i i n i$ &amp; C's. P.

It was not, however, possible to reach a final conclusion, as certain points arose v/hich had to be referred to our London Principals for examination and decision, and it was therefore agreed with the Shaikh to refer these points by telegram to our London Principals and to convey their reply to him as soon as possible, with a view to early conclusion of these discussions. The Stoaikh extended every courtesy and consideration to our representative, and appears desirous of concluding an agreement with us at an early date. lis It has now been decided that Mr. Chisholm must visit London for discussion of the remaining points out standing between the Shaikh and ourselves, leaving Basrah hy Imperial Airways on 9th November. We are sending our Mirza Juma to Qatar to inform the Shaikh that our resumption 0 f discussions with him will therefore be slightly delayed, but that we look forward to their resumption, and hope for a successful conclusion, at an early date. We have the honour to be. Sir, Your obedient servants. For ANGLO-PERSIAN OIL CO., LTD., ^ ^ /J~V ' general manager .My dear Fowle, I enclose my official letter to you on the latest stage of our negotiations with the Shaikh of Qatar. In view of the Shaikh's recent visit to Riyadh it has been sat: sfa.c t ory to find that,he shows no signs,. of wishing to Keep us out of his territory until after August next, when, on'the conclusion of our current agreement with him, he might be able to invite other parties, such as the Hasa Concessionaires, to Did for his concession. dated Zth Iv ov em ber S.

This was that before commencing discussions in Dohah on 16th October, the Shaikh showed to Chisholm a letter Wfiic i he hau receivea u fe« uaya be fore- from the Political Resident con cerning his rii-rotiati ons. This letter simply aaviseff^the Shaikh on behOT^^-inErrS. that there are certain points in our proposed draft Concession which must be altered, .ne ohaikh professed to be perturbed at such a letter, which, „»o re J 5Sed - t0 him ' a PP ea r'ed to imply that he had done something ront,, and requested Chisholm to inform him whether he(the Shaikh) was making an agreement with H.M.G. or the Anglo-Persian Oil ompany. Chisholm advanced the view that the purpose of the letter was purely to remirid the Shaikh that, in consequence of a ? reeni ^ n1: ' s with H.M.G., no agreement between himself and finfiiS- . other Company) for a Concession, could be whst u b ^ nd;Ln S until it had been approved by and that tpJi s ? u -'- a he ^done was for the Shaikh and himself to agree ariJf 3 ' It P^sible, which would be binding if H.M.G. did not .

If it is possible for me to be informed of what such alterations are, I should be very pleased to receive them. I should be most grateful also if you could let me know how, under H»1 .G' s existing relations with the Shaikh, we stand in re gar a to the following points raised by him. (1) ^ If we operate in Qatar, we shall require to engage from the Shaikh, certain guards an d wat chmen, some of'' whom will be armed. I imagine practically every man in Qatar has a firearm of some sort, but the Shaikh has requested, if he has not sufficient arms for guards required by us, Aether we can supply the necessary rifles and ammunition. Could you inform me if we are tied in any way in dealing with such a request? (2) have asked that the prevailing text of any agreement with the Shaikh should be the English text; the Shaikh objects to this, and states thatTTF^ag^ ments with H.G. are in Arabic only, or that the^ Arabic prevails. Is this correct? (3) ^ The Shaikh wants it defined that, if operating in^Qatar, the Company will remove■any emp1oyee who is objectionable to him, and that any'dispute between a foreign employee of the Company and one of his subject should be referred to him for settlement. We are anxious to meet these requests as far as possible, but I should like to know what, if any, agreements he has with H.M.G. regarding jurisdiction over British nationals or foreigrers generally before committing myself.

Please refer to your letter Io.72-D/7, dated the 19th Hovamber 1933, regarding the Q^tar Oil negotia tions. 2, The letter at which the Shaikh of (iatar was perturbed was issued 'by order of His Eajesty's Govern ment. We don't want to interfere in the negotiations but, as you know, the ihaikh is hound hy Treaty not to grant any oonoessions without our approval, and certain safeguards have to oe inserted in any concession from the point of view of His Majesty's Government. Chis- holm's explanation stated the case correctly and I am glad that it left the Shaikh satisfied. I visited him from here on the 12th instant and explained matters to him personally, so I presume that things are all right now. If, after Ghisholm's return any misunderstand.- iags ariss regarding the Shaikh's obligations to His Majesty's Government, you can let me know and I will explain them away to the Shaikh. 3. With regard to the points raised in the concluding paragraph of your demi-official letter of '7th November 1933. (1) Under Article XI of the draft con cession/ '^Ikington Is^uire, General I-anager, Anglo-Persian Oil Company Ltd., A b a d a n.godosss I oq 'th.c responsibility for protscliion is on th.© Sbai ^li and I tliink it would be undesirable for the Coa. any to supply any arms or atetmition to the SLaikli. The latter can always purchase arms from India or elsewhere under a 'No Ohjection'statement from me, (2) As far as I am aware, the Treaties with iatar and the Trucial Chiefs were apparently made only in Arabic, As long as a very careful Arabic text is prepared difficulties should not arise. (s) This raises some important issues and I will let you have a reply as soon as I can. 4. By the way, the obaikh made one curious remark in the course of ooovorsation on the 12tht He said 'Supposing some other Oompany not the Anglo- Persian oil Oompany finally get the conee3sion, do I have to inform His Majesty's Government after all my terms with the other Company are arranged, or directly the other Oompany approaches me' 1 . 1 replied, of course, that he should inform His Majesty's Government directly any other Company approached him - if they ever did. One such 'other Company' likely to he especially interested in Qatar is I imagine the group which has got the Hasa Concession. Qatar would doubtless round off their area conveniently. But I have heard nothing whatever of any such movemert.

E, The points raised by the Bhaikh for definition are avlcward ones, or at least the second one is. The first - remoTal by the Company of any employee objection able to the Bhallch is comparatively simple* If the employee in question is a Qatar subject, the '^ha 1 kh can of course do -what he likes with him, and if a foreigner, i.e. a non-Qatarl, the Company will presumably arrange for his transfer elsewhere, or for his dismissal. 3. The second point, however, that any dispute between a foreign employee of the Company and one of the Shaikh's subjects should be referred to the Bhaikh for settlement, i s more difficult. As far as jurisdiction of the Bhaikh over foreign subjects is concerned, the Shaikh is in the same position as his colleagues of the ^rucial Coast* For that area no Order In Council of course exists, (as for Muscat, Bahrain and Kuwait), giving ertra- terrltorial rights to British and foreign subjects^ and arranging for these to come under the jurisdiction of the Political Agent, ''here is no machinery, for instance, for settling the claims for debt of British Indian subjects against/ ^aittomite Esquire, The India Office, LOHDOF.against the local inhabitants, and all the Political Hesiiient car? do, vihen approached on the subject by the creditors, is to try to arrange some sort of com^ro^ise tbrongh the Residency Agent, and^bring presrure to bear on the Bhallch - if it is practicable to bring that 'pressure* Similarly, there is no Machinery for settling criminal Matters, and, theoretically, British subjects in Qatar and the Trucial Coast presumably coiae entirely under the jurisdiction of the local Hhaikh, and could, for instance, be imprisoned by hira. In practice, however, as far as I know, no such case has ever arisen. The Shai khs have never claimed judicial authority over British subjects in their territories, and we have always assumed that they cannot do so* 4» The BhaiMi of Qatar will, I think, lay special stress on this second point, as doubtless he is afraid ??ith the coming of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, (which is regarded on the Arab Coast as a semi-official concern), that his authority will be encroached upon, and that Clatar will become a sort of quasi-British possession# Dven if he does not fear this, but wants to give the Concession to a rival concern, he will ma Ice play with this objection in order to create difficulties# I talked the matter over with Loch and we agreed that if the Shaikh persisted in raising this pointy an answer on the following lines mi^it be given him. In case of such disputes, as are con templat ed, the matter might be referred to the Shaikh, who, in consultation with the local representative of the Company, would endeavour to settle it in an informal manner. If, however,/&amp; however, this procedure failed to compose the dispute, and the matter was a serious one, it could he referred to a Joint Court (such as exists in Bahrain) compOBed of the Bhailch and the Political Agent, Bahrain^ to meet the case, you might let me have a brief telegram to this effect, and I will talk it over with Elkington, whom I am hoping to see soon* You could also discuss it perhaps with the Anglo-^ersian Oil Company's representatives in London. 6» By the way, it had heen rumoured that the Shaikh of Qatar/soifje time recently paid as tribute to Ihn Baud the large sum of £ 10,000/-« The truth of the matter appears to 'be that some years ago the Shaikh was foolish enough to lend His Majesty a large sian, whether as much as £ 10,000/- or not I do not know, and one of the objects of the Shaikh's visit was to try and extract the repayment of the loan. In this, as might be expected, he was unsuccessful; apparently all that he got out of Ibn Baud being a hospitable recerrtion, soft words and a gift of some secondhand cars. In fact Ibn Baud's usual treatment of importunate creditors. (You will remember that the Shaikh of Kuwait some years ago in a weak moment also lent Ibn Saud money for me of his military expeditions, for which I believe he is still waiting)« I am sending a copy of this letter to Metcalfe.

I am more than pleased to find that you approve of Chlsholm's explanation to the Shaikh of Qatar regarding the letter which had given rise to some misunderstanding in the Shaikh's mind, and also that you, personally, have had an op portunity of making clear to him his position vis-a-vis his obligations to His Majesty's Government in these negotiations. There should now be no further difficulties on this score. h 1*^0 Whilst on this subject you will remember that in my D.O. letter of the 7th TTovember I asked you if it would be possible for me to be Informed what the alter ations are that His Ma j esty 1 s Government require to be made In our proposed draft concession. I understand that our London Office Is still ignorant 'concerning the alterations which have to be made and, as Chlsholm is exoected to proceed to Bahrein by air from London, arriving at Bahrein on the 14th December and at T )ohah on the 15th December, I should be extremely grateful for any Information which you are able to give me on the subject. If the alterations are of more than ordinary Importance, perhaps you would be kind enough to telegraph the gl st of JLtham to me on receipt of this letter, so that I may give Chlsholm any Instructions necessary before he resumes negotiations with the Shaikh on the 15th December. I shall be making contact with Chlsholm at Basrah on the 13th Instant. I am very pleased to have your opinion on the fi rst ^ wo points raised in the last paragraph of my letter of the 7™ ^ovemBer and we will be guided accordingly. With regard the third point, I note that you will let me have a reply as soon as possible. If you are not able to do this before ^e 13th December, i Presume that we shall be acting in accord- ^ce with H.M.G's wishes, if we oualify any clause which we may- 2 - find it necessary to include in the draft concession re^ardine the Shaikh's jurisdiction over British or foreign nationals by adding a^few words to the following effect;- ' as lone- as sjch .jurisdiction Is In no way contrary to any a^reeinent wTMeh the Shaikh has with His Majesty's Government.' I am not altogether surorised to find that the Shaikh questioned you with regard to his position should any other Conroaijjr approach him for the purpose of obtaining the concession, although up_to the present he has made it obvious that he really wished to give the concession to us and that he had no desire to give it to any other ComDany. I much appreciate your reply to the Shaikh's ouestion and if you are at any time able to give me any further inform ation bearing on this subject, I should of course be very Dleased. A As you say ' '^e 'other Company 1 is more than likely to De the group ?/hich obtained the Hasa Concession, but it is 4 possible that the Arabian Development Syndicate, which was registered in London lasTTmonth, may^OTTo be interested. o I hope that Chisholm will return from London with good prospects of concluding an agreement with th e Shaikh and on hi s reuurn t rom Dohah I will lose no time in acquainting you with the latest developments in the proceedings.

Further to previous correspondence regarding our nego tiations with H .E. th e Sh aikh of Qatar we now have the honour to report the latest stage in these negotiations, which is as follows. Mr. Chisholm arrived in Dohah on 15th December, and discussions took place with the Shaikh on 16th, 17th and 18th December. It was explained that as the result of our previous discussions we had redrafted the general terms of our proposals so as to cover various points which the Shaikh wished to have included in them, and we had also decided to offer him cash terms considerably in excess of those previously offered. At the Shaikh's request Mr. Chisholm gave him an Arabic trans- • lation of our proposed new general terms (as forwarded to you /under cover of our letter GM/1327 of 15th December) omitting Article 4 which concerned only the cash terms; as regards the cash terms Mr. Ghisholm also communicated to the Shaikh the figures which we were now prepared to offer. The attitude adopted by the Shaikh however was, while admitting the length to which we had gone to meet him as regards both general and cash terms, to refuse any offer which did not emh^oyjto the full the very large demands made by him at our Q ^obe r^ aiscuss lon &amp;l He made quite plain his opinion that, if we would not accept his terms, there were other parties who would be ready to do so on the expiry on 25th August 1934 of our current agreement with him. As the Shaikh could not be persuaded to abandon this attitude, Mr. Chisholm suspended negotiations and returned to Abadan on 21st December. The Shaikh, while expressing regret that agreement could not yet be reached, and stating that unless his demands could be accepted in full it was unnecessary for our representative to revisit Qatar, said that he would be glad to receive and consider any communications received from us. We have reported on this situation to our London Principals and will inform you in due course of any further developments.

As these represented a very long step forward from our previous proposals, and indeed embodied practically everything which the Shaikh had asked for in October, it appeared obvious to Chisholm that some new factor must have changed the situation since his last visit. \ And bearing in mind the indication given in Section 4 of your 4 letter C/192 of ^4th November to me, and also taking into account various blunt references by the Shaikh to the approaching end (in August next) of our current agreement, he suspected that the Hasa Concessionaires had been making overtures to the Shaikh. This suspicion unfortunately proved well grounded, as subsequently Chisholm was shown a letter received by the Shaikh in November from the Standard Oil of California's chief representative in Hofuf, stating that he had 'been asked to inform Your Excellency that if at any time you should be ready to correspond with the Standard Oil Company of California they will be ready to deal with you. They will be pleased to give your proposals consideration'. It appears therefore that, with this letter in his hand and the profitable nature of similar tactics pursued by the Shaikh of Luwait in his mind, the Shaikh is now contemplating waiting until August next and then introducing an Anglo-American competitive element to his own advantage. tho iu 1 shoulci a(ici 'that the letter was not shown to Chisholm by - ne Consequently we have no official cognizance of it, although the chances are that the Shaikh meant Chisholm to see it.

Mr. Laithwalte recalled that the meeting had been arranged at short notice to enable Departments to consider what amendments were desirable in the redraft of the Qatar concession, of which copies had been circulated by the A.P.O.C. at the meeting at the India Office on 11th December. It was proposed that it should be followed the same afternoon by a further meeting between Messrs. Praser and Hearn of the A.P.O.C., It which Mr. Starling and Mr. Laithwaite, in the light of the views expressed by the Departments, could indicate in general terms the directions in which it was desired to amend their draft. It would of course be impossible to commit H.M.G. in any ?vay on the major question of assignment. Neither on this question, nor, indeed, on the details of the draft, had instructions yet been taken from higher authority. But if amendments not raising points of principle, but representing improvements from our point of view, could be secured in the draft in the course of discussion with the Company's representatives, no difficulty would presumably t'e seen. h y- y XwfThe otner Departments concerned expressed their general agreement, in particular as to the d V U i-u.

The Petroleum Department drew attention to thetact that I the article as revised gave the Company the exclusive right to 'carry away' the substances which it was entitled to secure, but saw no objection to this. Mr. Laithwalte said that the Government of India had sent a reminder to the Political Resident on the question of the boundaries of Qatar.

In reply to a question Mr. Lalthwaite as to the probability of any special .Admiralty/&amp; 3. Admiralty interest developing In connection with hsTooursj Gciptciin King expressed the opinion tiint it was unnecessary to rrake special provision for this at the present time. (h) It was not clear whether the words 'any such normal extensions thereof' referred to extensions of buildings, though this was presumably the case. It was agreed that tne Company should he asked to make the position clear, out that no objection need be raised if the assumption stated was correct. Co) The phrase at the end of sub-paragraph 1 'and W subsequent extensions thereof' appeared dangerously wide. We were dealing with a period of 75 years and it was conceivable that difficult political problems might arise if the sheikh or one of his successors were, e.g., to conquer a portion of Saudi Arabia or,to take an extreme case, to occupy Bahrein. It was agreed that the Company should be invited to omit the words. (d) period of agreement . No objection was seen to an agreement for 75 years, although this period was longer than that of the Bahrein and Persian concessions. (e) The Petroleum Department said that it was unnecessary to specify areas for mining purposes under this article now that it was proposed to tive the Company rights over the whole area of the state* (f) Attention was drawn by the India Office to the fact that in a semi-civilized area such as Qatar it would be necessary for the Company to walk extremely warily in anything which might offend religious susceptibilities. We should find ourselves faced with responsibility for safeguarding their interests in the event of serious trouble breaking out and it would be well/4. well to impress upon them the delicacy of the position. Bie meeting agreed and thought that this might he put to the Company as a general point in connection with the concession. article 5.. Tne Petroleum Department suggested that it would he desirable further to safeguard the interests ol the Sheikn oy amplifying this article on the general lineb of Articles 12A and 13 oi the A»P«0»C«'s Persian concession. The effect would oe to require the Company to preserve the deposits of petrol, if any, and to utilise the latest scientific methods in their operationr It was agreed that this should he put to the Company. Article 4 . This article was likely to he/of the greatest importance to the Sheikh. The Foreign Office expressed the view that, subject to consideration of our own interests and those of the Sheikh, it was desirable to meet the A.P.O.C. so far as possible in view of the undesirability of bringing In American Interests if this could be helped. The petroleum Department agreed, and the Admiralty said that they thought their higher authorities would probably also agree, subject to the reservations in question, as did Mr. Laithwaite. Mr. L8.ithwaite said that the Company had already inade it clear that they did not wish to disclose their bargaining figures at the moment and we could not very well press them to do so. On the other hand, it would te material, in considering the terms to be accepted, that under the present concession they were to receive an exclusive licence in respect of the whole area of Qatar . some 3,000 square miles. Mr. star 1 inp said that the use of the phrase 'exported from or sold for consumption in' raised an Important point. This formula was one which had been ^sed in the Persian concession. The effect would De to make/make It possible for the Company to use locally, to waste, or to lose in refining locally, as much oil as they mifeht think xit. He had. regarded the point as so imterial tiiat he hctd taken ths instructions of higher author!oy on it. As a result he expressed the opinion that it was,unnecessary to take exceotion to it, so lone I inane iai ' u xuu &amp; as the/terms offered by the Company proved adequate, though it seemed desiraole that tne sheikh should fully understand what was involved. Article 5 . In the light of Mr. Starling's statement on Article 4 it was agreed that no Question neea oe raised as to the use of the words 'exported from or sola for consumption in' instead of some phrase such as 'produced'. Article 6 . (a) It was agreed that it would be^ desirable to make the provisions of this article the specifically subject to/compensation provisions of Article 1 (as in the case of Article 2 of the revised draft). (b) Considerable discussion took place as to the risks involved in giving the Company an absolute righ t, as in the terms of the article, in any circumstances, to construct communications, railways, refineries, etc. The meeting were reminded of the difficulties which had arisen in Hasa in connection with the provision of landing grounds for aeroplanes, and elsewhere in Saudi Arabia in connection with wireless. Local prejudices and the danger of inflaming the Bedouin had been alleged by Ibn Saud as a reason for postponing action or refusing concessions. If similar difficulty wose in ^atar our position, if it proved necessary for us to intervene in support of the Company, might be difficult/C§d) 6. difficult. On tiie ooiier hand, the Company would clearly Xiha. 't require soiiiB clBar uiicl6rsijd.riQing/tli6y.Ji^d. 1 ib8rt&gt;y to ©rsct such buildings, etc. as were essential for their purpose, e.g. . refineries, pumping stations, harbours, pipelines, workshops, etc. The meeting was incline a to think that Hie slmplsst course might be to draw a distinction between constructions of tnis nature and comnunications taken in a broad sense - wireless, roads, railways, etc. - and that in discussions with the Company we should aim in the first place at making the Company's rights under the first sub paragraph of tne article subject 'to the agreement of the Sheikh which shall not be unreasonably withheld', and if endeavour to this proved Impossible to/make a special exception in respect of communications and wireless, putting them on a different footing from the technical buildings required by the Company. It was thought that here, as in the case of Article 2, the importance of aslking extremely carefully, having regard to local conditions might be impressed on the Company. Agt^wlgJ. (a) It was agreed that the desirability of specifically safeguarding the position of any aerodromes acquired by us in qatar should be considered in connection with this article. (b) Attention was drawn to the possibility that 1 considerable areas might be in the possession,not of the Sheikh, but (as appeared in the past to have been the case elsewhere on the Arab littoral) of the Jowasimi Arabs. 'I^at was, however, a point for the Company. (c) The second sub-paragraph was too widely stated shd did not sufficiently safeguard private possessors against expropriation at the request of the Company. It was agreed that the Company should be invited either to adopt/(g) 7. adopt a wording on uhe general lines oi Article 4(b)( a ) 01 their Persian concession or to revise the first sentence 01 tne sub-paragraph to run as i'ollows:- «myother lanas, houses or buildings required by the Company may be bought or leased by it with the of_and on conditions to be arranged with the proprietors Ulereof, but the of K , ]nh ^ lease shall not be in excess...' (d) The phrase, 'such land shall at all times be less than the whole area of ^atar' caused some surprise, tut was assumed to have been inserted at the request of the Sheikh. Article J,. It was agreed that the Company should oe Invited to insert in the second sentence of the first suD-paragiapn the words 'subject to the same proviso'. Article 10 . (a) Some discussion took place as to the desirability of fixing a maximum period during which the general customs exemption granted to the Company should run. The general feeling of the meeting was, however, in favour of letting the article stand, particularly now that the Company had to some extent met us by agreeing to pay duty on food supplies, personal goods, clothing and general merchandise imported by It ior the personal use of its employees. (b) The question was raised of the desirability of giving the Company complete exemption in respect of harbour dues. The meeting felt that as any harbours made would be developed by the company, it would be treasonable to request them to pay harbour dues. On the other hand it would be worth ensuring that they would a gree to the free use of such harbours by the Sheikh. Goods imported by private individuals through such harbours/8. iiartours would of course be liable for any ordinary import duty charged, but it would be unreasonable to give the Sbelkh the right to charge harbour dues in addition in respect of the importation of such goods. iii'ticle 11 . Attention was drawn to the correspondence which had taken place between the Political Hesident and IvSr. Klklngton, ana also to the fact that under Article 3 of the Qatar Treaty of 1916 the Hneikh was precluded from obtaining arms, save under arrangements therein defined, to be made and approved by it was agreed that the Resident's view in the matter, as expressed in paragraph 3a) of his letter dated 24th November to Mr. Elkington, should be accepted. — u: '- c ^ e assignment, it was recognised that this aiticle raised fundamental questions ana that no decision cou ld be tak en on it except after reference to higher : n , authority, on the other hand it seemed desirable so far as possible to clear the ground with a view to exploring how far the Company were in fact prepared to go and what their intentions were in the matter. It had throughout Dev&gt;n appreciated that as the A.P.O.G. were conducting £is agents negotiations in Qatar only/on behalf of the I.P.O., which fes Itself an international Company containing only a relatively small British element, it would not be possible to p.dCtlce to insert lull British safeguards or provision j - 01 j-Ull British control in the concession granted. gea.]_ said that the Admiralty were of opinion that rfoula D8 desirable to insert the following safeguards An any assignment: (a ) The assignee company to be registered in Gr3 at Britain; (b) The Company's office in Great Britain to be ^ D y a British subject; (c)/f 9. (c) British director; (d) Chief Local Representative to be persona g-rato to and a British subject. Of these, they would like (a), (b) and (a) to appear in the concession itself. Mr. Starling suggested thatwe might provide that the Company should be and renain a British Company registered in Great Britain, having its plfe.ce of ousiness in Great Britain and a British Ggairnan, on the same lines as the I.p.c. Mr.Laithwaite said that might be possible, but that he thought the India Office would be content (if this was found to be and woula ease matters) sufficiently legally watertight/to cover certain of these points in an exchange of letters with the Company, particularly the point about the Chief Local Representative. It seemed desirable also to provide that the Sheikh should approve the conditions of transfer. Mr. Seal said that the Admiralty were anxious that they should be in a position to acquire or buy the oil produced in time of war, and he was anxious therefore that there should be no reassignment to American interests. Mr. Starling drew attention to the difficulties of entirely safeguarding the position when we were daling with an international company such as the I.P.C. Mr.Seal agreed that it was desirable to make provision that the consent of the sheikh and approval of the conditions of assignment should be included. Mr. Warner suggested that + v . in so many words Me simplest course might be to meet the Company/as regards transfer to the I.P.C. if that was the point which they had principally in mind in the first sentence 01 the article and then make provision to safeguard our Position in the event of any reassignment. After considerable further discussion it was agreed that the Company should be Invited to agree to a redraft of/(SS&gt; 10. of the first sub-paragraph of this article on the following lines: 'The Company shall he and remain a British Company registered in Great Britain, having its principal place of business in Great Britain, and the Chairman shall at all times be a British subject, subject to these conditions wia to the approval of the Sheikh and on conditions to be laid down by him, it shall have the right to transfer this agreement to another commercial company etc.' it was also agreed that Mr. Warner's suggestion might be put to the Company• The meeting then considered the second sub-paragraph of Article 12. Mr. Laithwaite said that it seemed most important that the terms on which the subsidiary commercial companies should be formed should be subject to the prior approval of 1 agreed. H.M.G./ Mr. Starling suggested that (following the example of the British Gil Development Concession) we might Insert the words 'under its own control' after the words 'subsidla^' commercial companies' and might also provide that any such companies should enjoy the rights and privileges and assume the engagements of the parent company. It was agreed that this should be put to the A.P.O.C. Cn a general point Mr. Laithwaite said that it might be desirable to emphasise to the A.P.O.C. representatives that while we were prepared to regard their draft concession as generally satisfactory (subject to their meeting us over assignment, etc.) they were not to assume that if a egotiat ions between the A.P.O.C. and the Sheikh broke down we were in any way permanently committed to these terms. If other competitors came into the field the competitive offers put up would have to be considered one against another. The meeting agreed. Article 13-7 11. It was agreed tiiat the Company should be asked to sub-paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 to Insert provision that producing wells or borings shou ld be handed over in good order and repair and fit for furth er working. article 15 . The India Office suggested that to the interests of the Sheikh it might be desirable to reword this to run, ' a period of such aelay, together with such period as may be reasonably necessary in the view of the Political .Resident'. It would of course be open to the oheikh uo go to aroitrcition on the point, but something less uIciborate seemed preferable. The meeting agreed. Article lo . Mr. Laithwaite said that the India Office on general political grounds regarded it as undesirable uhat the third aroitrator should be nominated by the Court of International Justice at The Hague. They would much prefer the Political Hesident (on whom this responsibility had devolved to the original draft). meeting agreed that this should be put to the Company. Article 17 . (a) It was pointed out that this gave us no guarantee as to nationality of any non-Asiatic foreigners who might be introduced. Secondly, that serious political difficulties might well arise if the Company were to import, say, Bahreinis or Iraqis, to operate the Qatar concession, on the ground that the wages demanded locally were unreasonably high. It was agreed that the Company should be Invited to consider the omission of the words 'or demand unreasonable wages'. On the Question of nationality of non-Asiatic employees, Mr.Eraser had already made it clear that they could not cormiit themselves and it seemed difficult, important as the point was, to do more than had been done in Bahrein and endeavour to secure that as large a proportion as possible should be British. (b)/Mr. Laithwalte saia that 12 * (b) / tii is 8,rtTcTe~ raised the difficult question of jurisdiction, ihe Company had niacie it clear that they C were not ^Pared to accede to the Sheikh's request that disputes between its employees and his subjects should be aecided by him and iu would probably be necessary to reach some agreement with him over the cession to H.M.G. of his jurisdiction over foreigners, though this was likely to be by no means easy. Mr» Warner said that here, as in the case 01 Articles 2 and 7, it was necessary to bear in mind the possible responsibility with which we might find ourselves burdened in connection with the protection 01 J-Oi^isn employtses etc. in Qatar, and the contingent risk of foreign interference if we proved unable to safeguard their position adequately. Mr. Laithwaits expressed agreement and said that if the concession ¥/as developed it seemed likely that we might have to consider some time in the future trie appointment of a political officer to Qatar. Article 18 . A similar article appears in the A.P.O.C Persian concession and it. was agreed that its meaning was obscure it was unobjectionable. Ar^i£l^_^£. 'The Political Resident had expressed the opinion that a careful Arabic text might at a pinch suffice. Hie Foreign Office Intimated that the point was probably of less general importance to them than if we had been dealing with the question of a treaty, but it would be well that we should not finally commit ourselves to the Company upon it. INDIA OFFICE. I5th December 1953.■ . ■Tndla Offi ce COJTOENTIAL P.Z. 8066/33 yi nal Record of meetlnc- held at the India Office on the Tith December to discuss oil in Ko-weit ' anri Q^tar. There were presents- Mr. L.D.Wakely in the Chair, Mr. GoW.Rendel ) Mr, C.F.A. Warner ) Foreign Office. Mr. K.R* Johnstone ) Mr« F.G.Starling5 Petroleum Department. Captain King ) Admiralty Mr. Seal ) Mr *J.C.Walton ) Mr.J.G. Laithwaite ) India Office. Mr. G.E.Crom'bie ) Mr. Fraser ,., Deputy Chairman^ Anglo- Mr. TTcv q-v*ri Persian Oil Company. Mr. Hearn Anglo-Per si an Oil Company Mr, Wakely said that Mr. Fraser and Mr, Hearn, of the A.P.O.C. had, he understood, 'been good enough to offer to attend | meeting at which they could explain to the interested departments lie position and policy of the A.P.O.C. in the Gulf, The Company were of course aware of the general position, which was that the Sheikhs concerned were precluded from granting any oil concessions without the prior concurrence of H.M. G. who had, while paying iSpecial attention to the interests of those Rulers to consider applications for concessions from all points of view. A statemsnt pom the Company would, he felt, be of much assistance, Mr. Fraser explained in the first place that in Qatar pe A.P.O.C. were precluded from acting on their own behalf and puld act only as the agents of the Iraq Petroleum Company since fetar was within the area covered by the I.P.C.Convention. Any pnoession would, however, if granted 'by the Sheikh, be in the name of the/ ^1^-, ^ hthe A.P.O.C. They had reason to believe that the Standard Oil Company of California, a purely itaerican Company who had already obtained a footing in the Gulf at Bahrein and at Hasa, were also interested in Qatar. The Sheikh of Qatar had entered into an agreement with the A.P.O.C. expiring in August 1934 during the currency of which the A.P.O.C. had the right to apply for concession giving them sole rights to work oil in Qatar and the Sheikh had undertaken not to consider the grant of an oil concession to anyone other than the A.P.O.C. This would not prevent the Standard Oil Company of California from making suggestions to the Sheikh meanwhile and thus making things difficult for the A.P.O.C. in their negotiations. Those negotiations had proceeded some distance this autumn, and Mr.Chisholm, the A.P.O.C. representative, had returned home to report progress in November.- The Sheikh had, however, now suddenly and quite spontaneously intimated that he wished to see the A.P.O.C. representative by the 14th of this month for the purpose of further discussion and Mr.Chisholm was already on his way out to Qatar by air with a revised draft concession. The Political Piesident would, of course, be consulted regarding the terms of the concession but the A.P.O.C. were anxious if possible to avoid the delay which would result if the Political Resident had to refer home for instructions on every point which might arise during the negotiations• Mr.Praser suggested that a great deal of time might be saved if H.KUG. would consent to give their blessing in advance to the general terms of the revised concession subject to any reasonable modifications which they might desire to make, and which could be the subject of infomial discussion here, praserMr. Fraser then circulated copies of the draft concession which Mr. Chisholm was taking out to Qatar. Mr. Wakely that the draxt could best be considered department ally in the first instance, and this was agreed, Mr. Fraser, howeTer, emphasising the anxiety of the Company that it should be dealt, with as expeditiously as possible. Mr. Fraser then turned to the activities of the A.P.Q.C. in Koweit• Here the position was different since Koweit was outside the area covered by the I.P.O. Convention# For some time past the A.P.O.C. and the American Gulf Oil Company had both been negotiating for a concession in Kovfeit, but hitherto the A.P.O.C. had been unable tq reach any agreement with the Sheiidi. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company were most anxious that there should not be a rival foreign oil concern in Koweit on the flank of their own operations in Persia and this was why they had themselves wanted to obtain a concession in Koweit. They had all along felt themselves at a great disadvantage in negotiating at Koweit in competition with the Gulf Oil Company, a very wealthy concern, owing to the danger that by granting too favourable terms to Koweit they might involve themselves in difficulties with the Persian Government who might also accuse them of frittering away their energies outside Persia. Kiey had therefore considered it desirable to endeavour to make an arrangement with the Gulf Oil Company* An arrangement ox a nature which fully safeguarded the interests of the A.P.O.G., to work jointly with them for a concession through a new Company to he formed on a 50/50 basis, had been signed, and now only awaited ratification, a decision as to which was expected this week., ^he negotiations with the Sheikh if the agreement in question was ratified would be carried on by Mr* Gass, acting on behalf of A.P # o .C ., and assisted by Major Holmes, on behalf of the Gulf4, Oil Company. He pointed out that the Gulf Oil Company was one of the parties interested in the I.P.C. through the American portion of the shares of the latter, while the Standard Oil Company of California was not# On this point Mr. Fraser explained that the A.P.Q.C, felt that they had a legitimate grievance against the behayiour of American oil interests in this area since the ?/ar. When, after the Yfar, the Americans and the French. ?/ere admitted to participation in the I.P.C, the A.P.O.C. had understood that the American oil interests would then be satisfied with their share in the I.P.C. This, however, had not he en so, since the Standard Oil Company of California, had later appeared and obtained oil concessions in Bahrein and Hasa; they now threatened to come in also at Qatar. The Standard Oil Company of California (now established in Bahrein and Hasa} was an entirely different Company from the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey (interested in the Iraq Petroleum Company) but there were occasions -when these large American groups appeared to work in sympathy with one another. Mr. Fraser suggested that the position would be very much simplified and delay avoided if the same procedure could be followed here as he had suggested in Qatar, i.e. if H.lvI.G. would be good enough to examine the draft concession at this end and make suggestions before it was presented to the Sheikh. He sincerely trusted that the Company could look for the support of His Majesty's Goyernment. Mr. Praser then offered to give further explanations/explanations on any points in connection with either Qatar or Koweit which the meeting might wish to raise, ii/r» vvakely said tnat subject to the opinion of* the meeting he thougnt tnere might be advantage in informal discussion such as the Company had suggested of the terms of draft concessions. This procedure had been adopted with advantage in the case of Bahrein, But it was important not to short-circuit the authorities in the Gulf. Mr. Walton and Mr. Laithwaite said that H.M.G. and the Resident both felt that they had been kept rather in the dark regarding the details and the course of the A.P.O.G.negotiations with the Sheikh of Qatar. In particular they had no clear idea of the financial terms which were 'being offered to the Sheikh for the concession. Mr» Eraser said that it was difficult to arrange the financial terms at this end and thought that this side of the matter could best 'be settled in the negotiations 'between their representative and the Sheikh of Qatar, He could assure the meeting, however that the financial terms were likely to be not ungenerous to the Sheikh. They might indeed have to be rather too generous from the A.P.0.C.point of view, since the Standard Oil Company of California had paid a very large sum for their concession in Hasa and this could not be without effect on their own negotiations. Mr. Starling said that the Petroleum Department would favour the adoption of Mr. Eraser ? s suggestion for informal preliminary discussion in London of points arising out of the &lt;iraft Qatar concession but that if .they were to give their opinion about any concession whether.in Qatar or Koweit they would of course have to have some idea of the financial terms since in some cases it was impossible to form an opinion whether the terms of a concession were fair without having this information. Mr. Hearn (A.P.O.C. ) rein inded the meeting that Ramazan started/started on the IVth December, ihe a. P.O.G representative was flue to arrive m getar on the 14tn so tnat Ij . the Sheikh really intended, to niake progress with the negotiations for a concession there would be very little time to spare. Mr. Laithwaite said that it was relevant that the Company's application for a concession in ^atar raised certain polioi cal issues which coulu not be dis'oosed of without consultation with India and the Hesident, which would take time, e.g. the issue of jurisdiction, which with the Company the sheikh h&amp;d already raised/ and the bringing into force of certain dormant articles of trie sheikii 1 s Treaty kr. praser said the Company had no intention of agreeing to the exercise of Jurisdiction by the Shaikh over their employees. Mr. rtenuel suggested that on this point it might help the A .P.O.C. in their negotiations in Qatar vis ! -a-vis the standard Oil Company of California or any other competitor if His to Majesty's Government were now/point out to the sheikh that certain conditions as regards jurisdiction over employees would apply in the case of any concession which he might grant. Mr. He am said that the A.P.O.G. understood that tte Sneikh haa lately asked the political Hesident about the procedure to he followed if a second Company came along in search of a concession, which seemed to imply that there was a real danger of the standard oil Company of California coming in at Qatar. . M; • Walton referred to Article 12 of the draft concession circulated by Mr. Praser which provided for the transfer of the concession from the A.P.O.C, to another party and asked what the position was as regards assignment and what the Company had in mind. Mr.Praser explained that this provision had been inserted because any/ I ll7. any concession would have to be handed over to the I.P.C,, (in which British interests were represented Dy tne A*Psnd dy the 3riti sli element in ixis sh-Qll group). If a subsidiary company were then formed the A.P.O.C. would claini and woula have a percentage of interest in it not less than the percentage (23f} of their interest in the Iraq petroleum Company. Such a company might, indeed, contain a larger British element than the I.P.C. if, for example, the French interests represented in the latter aid not wish to share in the new operations at Qatar. The A.P.O.C. of course wanted any new company to he as British as ■ possible and ne reminded the meeting that the alternative, that is the standard Oil Company of California, was a purely American Company. He mentioned that nobody knew how the standard Oil Company of California intended to market the oil which it obtained from Bahrein or Hasa, since tho various Standard groups had nover yet been known to compote with one another in marketing ^.3. Tie Petroleum Dopartmcnt state that there tire several standard G-roupjB/^ Mr. Laithwaite asked whether, if tne Qatar concession were handed over to the Iraq petroleum Company the exploitation of the concession would still be British. we attached much importance, both on general grounds and because of the difficult question of jurisdiction that might arise, to keeping exploitation here (and in Koweit) wholly in British hands. Mr. Praser .said that the personnel of the I.P.C. in Iraq was mostly British, since this had been found convenient by all parties concerned, though in theory the other participants in the I.p.C. could insist/insist on personnel in proportion to their share interest in the Company. He mentioned that over 52% of the material for the Iraq Petroleum Company pipe line had been ordered from the United Kingdom. He suggested that there was in practice no need for apprehension on the point. It would be better to avoid making specific provision in the concession, since that might lead other nationalities represented in the I.P.C. to claim the percentage to which their holdings entitled them. Turning to Koweit. Mr.Wakelv said he understood that the A.P.O.C. and the Eastern &amp; General Syndicate had first of all been negotiating against one another for a concession and that the latter had resigned their interests to the Gulf Company. The position now was apparently that the A.P.O.C. had entered into an agreement which was signed and merely awaited ratification to obtain and work a concession jointly with the Gulf Oil Company on a 50/50 basis which would extend to exploitation as well as to distribution, Mr. Fraser said this was the case and that his Chairman, Sir John Cadman, had particularly asked him to emphasise at the meeting in case any criticism was raised that this 50/50 arrangement with the Gulf Company had specially received the blessing of H.M.G., before the Company had entered into it. Mr, Wakely said that the India Office had no knowledge of any such approval having been given. Mr.Rendel said he understood that the A.P.O.C, had had discussions with certain members of the Foreign Office but that the Foreign Office had understood that the 50/50 arrangement was to cover distribution of the oil only and not exploitation, Mr.Praser reiterated that the idea/9. Idea of a 50/5 0.arran gement to ex tend to exploitation had been speollcal^ approved by H.M.G. he woula if necessary write a letter giving furtner details if desired. The arrangement wluh tao ^ulf oil Company h^d been forced upon the A. P.O.G. because it was embarrassing for them to offer large sums of money m Koweit (where perhaps there was no oil) in view of possible reactions on the Persian Government. Mjreover they understood that the sheikh himself wished for an international Gompany. He added that the A.P.O.C. had^also found that throughout their negotiations'the uulf oil Gompany through whatever source were kept informed of all thp a p n n + e -d.r.0.0. Oilers to tne Sheikh and had in their possession full copies of the correspondence that had passed, while the A.P.O.C. i^c^Vou no similar information about the offers made oy the Gulf oil Company. In answer to a question from Mr. Wakely, Mr.Fraser said that if they succeeded In reaching an agreement with fee Gulf oil Company the latter might easily alio, the personne l at Kowe it to bo even British, but that it would not be politic for the A.P.O.C, to suggest any arrangement about personnel to the Gulf Company at this stage, since it woulo only lead to a counter claim on their part. The A.P,O.C. (as in the ^ase of tar) thought it oest to have no provision about personnel in their agreement with the Gulf Company. With regard to the employment of Jwajor Holmes, wlio, he understood, was not entirely personaa to h.te.G,, Mr. Fraser assured the meeting that their own representative, Ivor. Gass, would take the chief part in the/10. the negotiations with the Shaikh ana that Iviajor Holmes, who would bs uselul on account ol his local knowledge and Influence with the Sheikh, would merely assist. He would de well looked after dy the A.P.O.C. representative and in any case the alternative to Major Holmes would he an American. Mr. Laitnwalte said that it would be necessary to consider this Question separately, it would, he thought, be desirable that all negotiations at Kowelt should be conducted solely through the Political Agent. This procedure had now been laid down In Bahrein in the negotiations between the Bahrein Petroleum Company and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company on the one hand and the sheikh of Bahrein on the other. Mr. Fraser said that he hoped this procedure would not be insisted upon in Qatar and Kowelt. Indeed he thought that under these conditions the sheikh of Koweit would refuse to negotiate for a concession at all. The A.P.O.C. would of course gladly keep the political authorities fully In touch with what was going on. Mr. Lalthwaite said that there was no Political Agent at Qatar and that so long as this was the case there could be no objection to direct negotiations between the A.PtO.G. .and the Sheikh, but he reminded Mr. Fraser that this would also apply to any competitor who appeared in Qatar, ana that we coula not discriminate in favour of the A.P.O.C. In Kowelt, where there was a Political Agent, the position was different and he did not see that American Interests could object so long as we did not u ibcrlminate against them. Direct negotiations ml^ht lead to serious difficulty on certain points. He reminded Mr.-Praser that the Sheikh was not able to grant/■(TS^ 11. grEUt 8. concession without th6 conssnt of jki&gt; eraser said that hitherto the Americans and the Sheikh had been allowed to negotiate direct and that if that policy were now changed it would have an extremely had effect both on the Gulf oil Company and on the Sheikh. Mr. Wakely said that H.M.G. could not commit themselves on this point and that the Departments concerned would have to consider the matter. tor, felton asked whether, when the arrang ements with the Gulf Oil Company had been completed, the A.P.O.C. would inform H.M.G. of the position. fer. Eraser said that if Mr. ! /valton meant that the A.f fC 1 «o. should show H.M.G. a copy of their agreement with the Gulf Oil Company the A.P.O.C. would have no objection but he thought that this might be embarrassing for H.M.G., who, as Mr. Wakely had explained, had to consider the interests of the Sheikhs. In making their agreement with the Gulf Oil Company the A.P.O.C. had had in mind the protection of their own interests (in which they had, he thought, tie en very successful) and not those of the Sheikh of Koweit and it might embarrass H.M.G. in advising the Sheikh if they had previously seen the agreement reached between the A.P.O.C. and the Gulf Oil Company. From our standpoint it would no doubt be satisfactory if the Sheikh received a substantial yearly sum, irrespective of whether the concession was actively operated or not. Any draft oil concession would, of course, be shown at once to H.M.G. In conclusion Mr. Fraser again emphasised the anxiety/&amp;&gt; 12. anxiety Ox tlie A*P.O.O, that nothing should, if posoihle, he allowed to delay their negotiations at Qatar, and asked wnether the Departments concerned coulu give an opinion aoout the revised A.P.O.C. drait concession as soon as possible. He hoped that H.ift.u., subject to any reasonable amendments that might oe agreed here, would feel able to instruct the Resident to regard it with a favourable eye. Mr. Wakely. said that certain major points had been raised which would have to be carefully gone into; Out this would be done as' expeditiously as possible. Every effort would also be made to examine the revised draft Qatar concession without delay. Ihe amendments desired by the Departments concerned could then oe discussed with Mr. Fraser by the Petroleum Department and xndia Office. He wished to repeat that it was the concern of K.M.G. to safe guard tiie interests of the Sheikhs; but that subject to this and to consideration of their own special interests and obligations in the Gulf they were naturally anxious to give any assistance properly possible to British concerns. Mr. Fraser expressed uhe hope that all possible assistance would be given to the A.P.Q.G., and added that he was anxious that the discussion which had taken place should be treated as strictly confidential. This was agreed. It was i »lso agreed that the Company should cable Mr.Ghisholm to give a copy of the revised Qatar concession to the Political Agent, Bahrein on his arrival there, and to arrange that a copy should go by mail to the Political Sesident.

P.Z. 7601 /33. oth Deceirfoer 1933. iy dear Starling, Ivjy letter of 17th August, P.Z.5002/33, gave our provisional conansnts on the Qatar oil agreement put forward by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. I now write to say that, save on the points helow, we have nothing at this stage to add to the criticisms contained in that letter, but that we suggest that it would be desirable, if the Petroleum Department could let us have their general observations in the light of comments of the interested departments and of the Resident before that date, to try to have a meeting before the end of this week, perhaps on Friday, 8th December. Would this be possible for you? 2. our only supplementary comments are on the point raised in paragraph 2(i) of Foreign Office letter of the 29th August, No.E.4794/156/91, which was further discussed in Seal's letter of 29th September, No.M.02517/33. It is, of course, the case that what we had in mind when my letter of 17th August, P .Z.5002/33, was written, was a clause C. Starling, Esq., Petroleum Department which/ Mines Department, Dean Stanley Street, S.W. 1.which would preclude the Iraq Petroleum Company from reassigning the concession to a non-British controlled company, we shall have to consider at our meeting to what extent, if at all, we should endeavour to secure in the present agreement the inclusion of a statement of the conditions subject to which alone we shall be prepared to agree to any further assignment. 3. The main alternatives seem to be as follows:- (a) To provide in the concession that no reassignment shall be permissible (or that no reassignment shall be permissible save with the prior approval of the Sheikh and subject to such conditions as he may lay down). The effect of this would oe that the concessionaires, if and when they wanted to reassign, would have formally to submit an application to the Sheikh in reply to which they could be informed in detail of the conditions subject to which alone we should be prepared to recommend the sheikh to agree to an assignment. (b ) To set out In. detail in the concession the conditions subject to which alone reassignment will be permitted. If we adopt this course (and we should, of coarse, have to bear in mind the point taken in paragraph 6/5 of Admiralty letter of 29th September) there would, I think, he much to he said for improving on the conditions of assignment to which we were forced to agree in the case of the Bahrein concession, the circumstances of which were, of course, quite different, ana to endeavour to secure, e.g. that any assignee company should be registered in Great Britain (and not in Great Britain or Canad a) ana possibly that a given percentage of the Board should be British; that the Chief Local Representative should be a British subject, persona grata to H.M.G., and appointed only with their prior approval, and perhaps that the lessees should be required to undertake to refine locally and to give rights of preemption to the Sbeikh or H.M.G. Ihe disadvantage of embodying our desiderata in detail in the concession is that in the first place we may conceivably frighten off the A.P.O.C. or the I.P.O. (though given the active interest in oil in the Persian Gulf which is being manifested at present I should rather doubt if the risk was a very serious one if reasonable financial terms coula be agreed between them ana the Sheikh); secondly that we show our hand as regards in particular a British control clause and the right of preemption. I do not know how far consideration of the general/' 4 ' general oil policy of wtiicli we understand has been under consideration for some time, has progressed. But it is conceivable that it would be no less embarrassing, by a detailed description of our desiderata in a concession such as the present, prematurely to disclose the principles at the establishment of which we were aiming, than it would have been to have done so in the discussions about Koweit oil which took place during the summer of this year. (c) The third course as I see it is something on the lines of paragraph 7 of Seal 1 s letter of the 29th September, slightly modified, the general line of the provision in the agreement being that no assignment shall be permissible save to a company registered in Great Britain, on terms to be approved by the Sbeikh and with his prior approval. 4. It is, I suppose, quite impossible to safeguard ourselves against a repetition of what took; place in connection with the Eastern and General syndicate's concessions in Bahrein and Koweit, e.g. by providing not merely that any Sissignment entered into in violation of the stipulation referred to in (c) of the preceding/- 5 - d, but that it preceding paragraph shall be null and shall void the whole concession? 5. I do not know H; you are/^et in a position to give us material to reply to Powle's telegram of the 17th November, of which copies were sent to you and to Warner and Ivbore under my letter of 20th November, P.z.7476/33? The Sheikh's attitude, as illustrated by the correspondence received under Bushire despatches of 29th October, 176i-S, and 0^138 of 15th November, is not, I think, altogether isfactory. 6. , I am sending copies of this letter to Warner 1/ of the Foreign Office and Seal of the Admiralty, Yours sincerely, J.G.

ARTICLE 1. sub-para graph (1^ This adds the right to refine. As the Resident pointea out on the original draft,this sub-paragraph combines the rights of exploration, prospecting and mining, instead of the rights at each stage being specified 3n separate schedules. It is for the petroleum Department to advise whether this is objectionable. Sub-paragraph (jj) is new. ARTICLE 2. Provision should be added to safeguard the position of aerodromes. The phrase 'such normal extensions thereof as may be indicated by the Sheikh from time to time' is unsatisfactorily vague and might be made more precise. The boundaries of (^.tar are at present indeterminate. A reminder is being sent to the Resident on tills point. The Resident commented that the agreement contains no provision for the selection and specification of limited areas for mining purposes. Article 1, of course, grants exclusive rights over the whole area of the State. The Petroleum Department might advise whether it is important to specify areas for mining purposes. Article 3/AHTICLE 5 . The provision tiBt the Sheikh shall he kept informed of the operations of the Company is new and satisfactory. ARTICLE 4 . This has heen substantially modified. The figures to he inserted are a natter for negotiation between the Sheikh and the Company. Note that tnere is no definition of the commencement of commercial production (which is presumably the same thing as 'the commencement of exports of these substances'. If the royalties finally agreed under the article are sufficiently substantial this is perhaps less important^ The Petroleum Department might advise. ARTICLE 5 . Line S . The phrase 'exported from or sold for consumption in' is presumably deliberate and preferable to some more general phrase such as 'produced'. ARTICLE 6 . We previously commented that the terms of this article were very wide. It must presumably be read with the compensation provisions of Article 7, but it might be desirable to specify this. In the fifth line of the article the words 'as it may require' appear to have been omitted after the word 'works'. The second sub-paragraph is new and to _ the good. ARTICLE 7 . Tne first sub-paraKraph is as before. We need not take exception to it so long as our aerodrome etc. requirements are safeguarded by a separate clause. The/Ttie second sub-paragraph , while it specifies that purchase or lease shall he 'on conditions to he arranged with the proprietors thereof' rather suggests (particularly In view of its last sentence) that the Company is anxious to acquire a guarantee from the Sheikh that it shall he allowed to expropriate any individual on reasonable financial tems. This goes rather far, hut perhaps we need not object? AaTICLS 8. suh- paragraph (1) . Secona sentence . ? insert after the words 'the Cpmpany' the words 'subject to the same proviso'. Sub-paragraph (ii ) is perhaps harmless and does not amount to much. AHTIGLS 9 . The proviso is reasonable. AfiUGLa 10 . This has been very substantially revised. The Company are prepared to pay the duty on foodstuff, clothing, personal goods and general merchandise imported for the use of their employees. On the other hand, they are anxious for exemption in respect not only of material for the purposes of the or technical operations and for office equipment, but also for 'household furniture'. This is a point which is in dispute in Bahrein, but it is not perhaps of vital importance. It is for consideration whether some proviso should not be added in respect of harbour dues. The/The second suli-pura.-rao!i is aesigned presumably to safeguard, the Company from attacks on profits or Income. It is, however, very widely expressed. ARTIGLS 11 . Protection . Mr. Elkington has informed the Political Resident that the Sheikh has requested ' if he has not sufficient arms for guards required 'by us, whether we can supply the necessary rifles and ammunition. Could you inform me if we are tied in any way in dealing with such a request?' The Resident has replied that unaer the draft the responsibility of protection is on the Sheikh 'and I think it would be undesirable for the Company to supply any arms or ammunition to the Sheikh. The latter could always purchase arms from India or elsewhere under a 'no objection' statement from me.' We may agree with the Resident. ARTICLE 13 . Reassignment . This raises a major question for consideration. As the Company will operate on behalf of the fraq petroleum Company, which is not under British control, we can hardly press for a British nationality clause. But a decision on the point must await interdepartmental discussion in consultation with the Political Resident and the Government of India. se cond sub-naraKra'ph . The agreement to provide that the terms on which special subsidiary companies shall be formed shall be subject to the prior approval of HJVi.G. and/5. arid the Sheikh. We haci better ascertain in the same connection what arrangements the Company piopose for representation in Qatar. Their concession is to run for 75 years and it may well prove necessary to consider establishing a British Political •^ent In tnis area in the xuture» Particularly having regard to the international character of the I.p.C. it might be well to provide that once the concession has been granted (if the Company are allowed up to then to deal direct with the Sheikh) they shall thereafter, if ana. when a British political representative is appointed in Qatar, deal with the Sheikh only through him and that their Chief fiepresentative in Qatar shall at all times be a British subject, persona srata to H.M.G. ARTICLE 13 .- This has been substantially modified to the interest of the Sheikh. ARTICLS 14 . No observations. ARTICLE 15 . ? insert, in the interests of the Sheikh, provision that the question vh ether or not delay on the part of the 1 Company is satisfactory should be subject to the Resident's approval. ARTICLE 16 . We should, I think, see strong- objection to reference to the Court of International Justice, and ought to press for/±ov tJie rostoration of 'tiiG provision in the original draft agreement that the third, aroitrator, falling agreement between the two arbitrators appointed by one Sheikh and by the Company, shall be chosen by the Political Resident. Aui rj-iH,—17_. Hi is is all right so far as it goes, but we ought to secure by an exchange of letters from the A.P.O.G. some understanding as to the nationality of personnel imported from outside. Mr. Praser yesterday seemed optimistic as to the possibility of securing a fairly substantial British element. jjiti ICLa 18. The i ir st sub - Dars.gra Ph is very general, but we need not perhaps take exception to it? ARTICLB 19 . No comments. ARTICLE 30 . Language. This question has been raised by Mr. Slkington with the Political Resident, who replied that so far as he was aware 'the treaties with Q,atar and the Trucial Chiefs were apparently made only in Arabic. As long as a very careful Arabic text is prepared difficulties should not arise.' The sheikh has also asked the A.P.O.G, to undertake, in the event of their obtaining the concession, to remove any employee who was objectionable to him, and/and. to agree that any dispute between a foreign employee of the Company and one of his suojects shall be referred to him ior settlement. This raises an important general Question which will have to 'be lurther considered with the Resident and the Government of India before a decision can De taken on it. It is not, however, of immediate urgency in connection with the drafting of. the agreement. INDIA OFFICE. 12th December 1933 /CONFIDENTIAL. No. 19R1-S of 1933, % 622?
