Both places had been no more than habitual resorts of the King's ships since they were called upon to police the Persian Gull in the course of the nineteenth century. Basidu a village at the western end of the long islan of Kishm. has been so used since 1823. wl ;e n the piracies of the Gulf Arabs and of their Wahabi allies had compelled the Government of India to protect the traders and pearl hshers o Bombay by energetic measures. When sails gave way to steam a coal depot was established there. The naval connexion with Hanjam island dates from 1868. Four years earlier an effective telegraph service between India and Europe hai. been opened by the laying of cab e from Karachi to Fao at the head of the Gull. he Telegraphic Department of the Government of Bombay, and afterwards that ol ^he Govern ment of India, took over the service • Hanjam became a cable station and was regularly visited by British men -of-war; the Basidu coal depo was transferred there in 1911; but even the pro vision of a recreation-ground did not make his malarious and torrid isle an ideal port oi call. Now that the Persians, reorganized by a st rong ruler, can police their own waters there is no reason why the British Government should con tinue to follow a custom that grew up when the Sh\h possessed no fleet. The Bahrein islands which the Navy will use in future, are a British Protectorate. They are well governed by their hereditary Sheikh; they are the centre ot the pearl-fishing industry in the Gulf ; above * ' they lie on the route used since 1932 by tnc Imperial Airways machines on their way to India, and the island of Muharraq contain, the finest natural aerodrome between England and India The recent discovery of oil in these islands has increased their importance and has incidentally added to their amenities, crews of the four British sloops that are stationed in the Gulf will find Bahrein far healthier and far more attractive than levensh Hanjam or monotonous Basidu.

WILSON (Hitchin, U.) asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether British sovereignty, which had been main tained over a portion of Basidu Island, in the Persian Gulf, for over 100 years, had now been formally abandoned, and, if so, what, if any, steps had been taken to safeguard the Bridsh cemetery at Basidu, wherein many Bridsh seamen of all ranks had been buried during the past century. SIR J. SIMON (Spen Valley, L.Nat.).—The regular use of the station at Basidu, on the Persian island of Qishm, by his Majesty's ships has, hcf.q discontinued since 1911. The local i climatic conditions are unhealthy, and the place w&lt;M not British territory. His Majesty's Govern- me.&gt;t recently decided that British interests in the Persian Gulf would best be served by the transfer of the station to Bahrein, on the Arab side of the Gulf; and, in accordance with this decision, the station at Basidu is now being evacuated. Arrangements are under discussion with the Persian Government for the proper safeguarding of the British cemetery at Basidu. SIR A. WILSON.—Is it not the fact that for more than 100 years the British flag has been flown there, and that repeatedly there have been statements made that this was, in fact, British territory; and has that position not been frequently pointed out to the Persian Govern ment ? SIR J. SIMON.—I think that the terms of my original answer show that the place has not been regarded as British territory. SIR A. WILSON.—Why is it that news about the abandonment of a British naval station should reach us from Delhi instead of by an announcement of the Government in this House, having regard to the very ancient connexion which the right hon. gendeman has just explained ? SIR J. SIMON.—I cannot answer that ques tion. 1 did not know that the announcement had reached the hon. gentleman from Delhi. SIR A. WILSON.—In view of the unsatis factory reply and the importance of the issue involved, I give notice that I shall raise the ques tion at the earliest opportunity on the motion for the adjournment. CLAIM TO BAHRAIN ISLANDS SIR A. WILSON asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether the Persian Govern ment had now finally abandoned their claim to sovereignty over the islands of Bahrain. SIR J. SIMON.—The Persian claim to the islands of Bahrain, which has frequently been advanced in the past, has not, so far as I am aware, been abandoned; but his Majesty's Government, who have been in close treaty relations with the rulers of Bahrain since 1820, do not regard, and have never regarded, that claim as possessing any validity whatever. r j 4i _ DURRANT'S PRESS CUTTIMGS St. Andrew 's House, 3! t.

PERSIAN Guip^ NAVAL STATIONS REMOVAL TO ARAB SIDE from our delhi correspondent It is announced that the British naval sta tions on the Persian side of the Persian Gulf are being transferred to the Arabian side. With the concurrence of the Sheikh of Bahrein Great Britain will remove to Bahrein the stations hitherto existing at Hanjam and Basidu, which are being relinquished. Great Britain has had long-standing relations with the independent rulers of various States on the Arab coast and has developed special respon sibilities towards them. But the question of the location of these stations has been brought to the forefront lately in conseqiience of the transfer of the British air route to the Arabian side and recent commercial developments in the region. The Iranian Minister in London, in a letter to The Times, states that the Iranian Government have never recognized a British Protectorate over Bahrein, and still consider those islands as forming a part of the territory of Iran.f ort Cutting from issue dated. )l« #*liuiww Telephone'.

Truth Buildings, Carteret Street ; Cutting from issue dated ........193 Policing the Persian Gulf. The decision that the warships of the East Indies Command which patrol the Persian Gulf shall no longer use Hanjam and Basidu is purely a political matter. These bases are on the Persian coast at the entrance to the Gulf. Bahrein, on the Arab side, is in future to be the local headquarters of the British sloops. This is a better and more pleasant anchorage, and the fact that it is a less dominant position for 'traffic control is not very material, since suspicious dhows cannot be ' controlled by ships at anchor in any case. The suggestion is that the change has been decided upon in consequence of the transfer of the British air route to the Arabian side. But naval men who are, or have been lately, serving in these waters know that this is only a part of the story. Persia is developing a navy of her own. For some years past she has had two or three sloops, manned by people with a great sense of nationalism ot the brand that afflicted the Persian Government two years ago when it proposed to confiscate the Anglo- Persian oilfield. So seriously is the Persian Xavy taking itself that several rather irritating incidents have occurred, culminating in the arrival ol a sloop to challenge our eighty -year-old right to use Qishm Island. So we are now 'going over the way by friendly concurrence of the Sheikh ot Bahrein. Some day the Persian Navy may prove itself competent to undertake the policing duties now performed by British vessels, but at present there is no more evidence oi a desire to suppress the slave traffic than there is on the part of the Chinese Navy to stop piracy.

The Secretary of State ior India in paragraph 3 of his letter No.P.Z.2877/34 of 1st May 1934 accepted the proposals in Colonel Loch's letters quoted above. Moreover in Shaikh Hamad's letter of 16th April x934,in which he formaliy ratified the sale of the land to His Majesty's Government, he granted the use of the foreshore for building piers 'tetc., but stipulated that any damage done to any fish trap belonging to his subjects should be compensated for. 2 # Of the 6 tra^s belonging to Shaikh Abdur Rahman /Bahrain file puc 7/1 p*120. 4 a\ -2- Rahman Mr. Belgrave states| subject to Turther cont'irmation, tfeat ^robably only 2 are affected by the pier in its present site at site C. He is unable to say without further enquiry what the value of the 2 particular traps affected is, but anyhow the balance of compensation assessed for the re aining 3 fish traps will be available for meeting the claims of the owners of new fish traps who are affected by the pier being built actually et site C. d» The Senior Naval Officer in ^ragraph 10 of his letter No•23/0426 of 8th July 1936 asked my opinion as to whether the Admiralty or the Government is liable for compensation. This is really outside ray sphere to answer, but it is indisputable that His Majesty^ Government as a whole took on the liability for compensa tion and so some Government Department will have to stump up. However - vide paragraph 4 of India .Oi^ice P.Z. 2877/34 of 1st May 1934 -^the^Mmiralt^will have to make good the loss. 4* ir. Belgrave suggested to the Senior Naval Officer that the Bahrain Government should ^ut up a Notice, saying that all owners of fish traps who wished for condensation should put in their claims within one month from the date of the Notice, after which no claims will be considered. The Senior Naval Officer approved of this procedure and telegraphed to the Commander-in-Chief - vide his No.884 of 26th June 1936 - that it should be carried out, but the Commander- in-Chief in his reply. No.931 of 30th June 1936, made no reference to this proposal, asked that my views may be obtained and seemed to be under the impression that perhaps compensation for fish traps could not a be uphold against His Majesty's Government.

No. 501/33. i7\ y 1 - 1935 Dear Cole, When Colonel Fowle discufesed the Jufair fish trap question with me during his last visit he asked me how many of the eight traps whose value had previously been assessed were affected by the pier. I replied that I could not say definitely but T thought probably about two were affected. He then sent a letter on the subject to, I think, the Admiraltv. I now find that most probably claims for co^Bnsation for four or five of the eight fish traps will be made and those near the pier which are most affected are the most valuable ones. It will therefore be impossible to assume that the amount of money which the eight traps were assessed at will be sufficient to cover the compensation to owners of the other traps on the other side of the pier as well. I think perhaps this mistake should be corrected. Yours sincerely. Captain G. A.

Bahrain. Dated, Rajab. 30. 1354 October 28,1§35. jtom The Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain. To Sir, His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, Bahrain. Subject:- Jufair fish traps. I have the honour to refer to the question of the fish traps on the shore adjacent to the land at Jufair which was purchased last year from this government by the British Government. The foreshore on which the traps are situated was not sold to the British government. 2o The fish traps on the Jufair shore are ov/ned by private individuals, and in some cases by the Shia Wakf department, an organisation which deals with and controls religious endowments, This government is satisfied that the ownerships of these traps is establishedo 3. When the building of the pier at Jufair was started tenants and owners of fish traps com plained to this governmesit that the pier would injure their traps. I suggested that a proclama tion should be issued calling on fish trap ownersowners whose traps were damaged to complain in writing to the governmait within a certain time. A proclanBtion to this effect was issued on n s % months after the building had started. A number of complaints were received. 4. On //- 7'SU the owners appeared in C4 /0- the government office and each man described why and in what way his trape was damaged. I en close a note giving a list of the traps and the nature of the damage. The chief complaint of the owners is that the pier has affected the currents and therefore stopped the fish from 1 following their usual course, but they also complain that the passage of boats scares the fish and broke the traps. Another universal complaint is that the men who work the traps no longer have access to them. They are for bidden to enter the walled area at Jufair and in order to reach their traps they either have to go round the North shore or they have to climb over the pier which is difficult when carrying a load or driving a donkey. They ask that they should be allowed to enter the walled area in order to reach their traps by day or by night, in order to collect their fish, other wise they ask that the traps should be taken over from them at a valuation. Liany of the traps are not now being worked and some which have been abandoned are no longer visible because their fences have gone. 5. The government of Bahrain, in order to verify the eomplaints which were made, appointed a special committee of persons who are known to-3- known to be experienced in fish traps, and who are frequently employed by the Bahrain courts, under the presidency of Haji Yusuf bin Abdurr rehman Fakroo. The comniittee spent two days at Jufair examining the fish traps under various tidal conditions. Their report is enclosed. 6 t In this loatter there are two categories of people to be considered, the owners, who claim compensation for permanent damage and the tenants who claim compensation for the loss which they have incurred since the pier was built. The tenants especially are in an unfortunate posi tion, they are Babarna and very poor and they make their living by the sale of fish from the traps Wiich they hire. 7. Certain traps, which are marked on the enclosed list, are owned by the heirs of the late Shaikh Abdul Kehman bin Abdulwahab al-Khalifah, a member of the Ruling Family. These heirs owned property at Jufair which was bought from them by the Bahrain government and at the time of this transaction they were given a written guarantee regarding their fidi trapso It was agreed that if the catch of their traps was impaired by the building of jetties etc. or by the constant coming and going of launches their traps should be paid for at the price at which they had recently been assessed by the Bahrain Court. The traps were j v assessed at Rs 7^^ when the estate of Shaikh Abdul Rehman bin Abdulwahab was wound up. This matter is dealt with in the following letters:- Letter Ngu C/115 of 11th April 1934, from Adviser to the Political Agent, p ^ \&lt;C Para 10 'Letter No. 0/396-7/1 dated lEth April 1934 from the Political Agent to the Adviser. 8. The position of fish trap owners^other than the heirs of Shaikh Abdul Hehman bin Abdulwahab whose case is specially provided for, is guaranteed by the letter which was written by His Excellency on 16th April 1934 addressed to you. In this letter which was written on the completion of the whole transaction, His Excellency agreed to allow the British Government to use the foreshore for construct ing piers etc., 'provided that if any of the fish traps which are owned by our subjects are affected the British Government will pay compensation to the owners. tt 9. When the amount of compensation is con sidered I ask that the cases of the owners and the tenants should be dealt with separately. I also matters might perhaps be followed. In the case of property which is raidered totally useless com pensation would be fixed at the rate of ten times the annual rent of the current year. suggest that the practice of the Bahrain in such a Adviser to the GovernmentT* TRANSLATION.

I think that for suclAn a^ree aent to De in perpetuity is unusual. It is impossible to visualise conditions in Bahrain after twenty years and 1 do not think that the Government can bind itself to maintain a line to Jufair in perpetuity when possibly the demand for electric power might in the future be reduced to a very small amount, in which cjise the (government would have to^keep up an expensive line at a loss, 'fhe life of a pole in Bahrain is not more than £0 years, approximately. 1 suggest that tne agreement shoula be for Z0 years on the lines of yourletter that it should include a clause stating that all the ^ower and lighting requirements for Jufair should he obtain ed from the Bahrain Government during this period. ±o illustrate future possiuilities, by an extreme example; it would be possible for the naval authori ties to use power from the electric department for one single li^ht for which the iiahrain Government would ■£ have to maintain the present low tension line from Wanam to Jufair unless some such cota^ring clause was included: I v ' y\ LzJl LAND REGISTRATION DEPARTMENT. tWlO-iO 2^ 14M of 1354.

Request confirmation of this. 4.- I assume that the maintenance and repair of all electrical fittings inside the buildings, at Jufair beyond the main switch or switchboard are the responsibility of the naval authorities, either to renew and repair withwith their own appliances or to pay for any renewals or repairs effected by Bahrain electric department. Request confirmation of this. 5.- It is understood that the telephone system complete is the property of the Bahrain Government and that definite rules for repairs and maintenance of all items in the system are in force, and were accepted by the naval authorities when telephflne^were installed. 6.- as regards the apllication of (a), (b) and(cj of paragraph 3 to that portion of the power system between sub-station and the various buildings, the lighting of the pier and flagstaff and various road lights in the grounds, 1 am uncertain of the usual procedure and would be glad to have your views. 7.- assuming paragraphs 2,3 and 4 to be as stated I would suggest that the electric department of the Government of Bahrain should assume responsibilities as in para.3 (a), (b) and (c) for the portions mentioned in para.6 up to, in the case of building, the main switch or switchboard of each building, and that in other cases all light brackets, bulbs, switches etc. should be the responsibility of naval authorities. That, in return, all poles, wiring and other material /archased by admiral ty for use between main power station and the sub-station at Jufair should be handed over in perpetuity to Bahrain G-overnment who would then be in a position to utilise the poles up to capacity for any further lighting or telephone services they might desire. Mo.8I I I 1-3- 8.- if agreement in principle is reached on these proposals 1 would propose to obtain admiralty conf inaation, on receipt of which i would sugge st a formal ajreement^ should be drawn up between us, and that this should he Ope rative indefinitely and not for a specified term of years. od/ Y.3.Butler, CAPATAIN, SENIOR NAVAL 0FFIC3R, PERoLiN GULF.D.O.No. 503-3/22. iBth February 1936.

Shoreham. $ Fish-traps a t Jufair and compensation claims. Sir, I have the honour to refer to the question of Fish-traps at Jufair and compensation claims. 2. . The question has been considered by the Bahrain Government, who issued a proclamation on the 11th August 1936 calling upon any owners whose fishtraps had been damaged to submit representations within a t certain period. A Committee of persons experienced in the subject was then appointed by the Bahrain Government to investigate complaints and the result of their enquiry has been communicated to me by the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, who has given me a full list of claims, a copy of which is attached. 3. It appears that the traps on the Jufair shore are privately owned, in some cases by a religious organization dealing with endowments known as the Shi*ah Waqf Department. The Bahrain Government have satisfied themselves of the ownership of these traps• 4./U- t i r 1 - 2 - 4. When the building of the pier was commenced tenants and owners complained to the Bahrain Government and their claims were investigated as stated in paragraph 2 of this letter. During the investigation the owners complained that the pier affected the currents and obstructed the usuel course of the fish. They also complained that the noise of the motor boats frightened the fish. Another universal complaint was that owners were not able to obtain access to their traps owing to their being forbidden to enter the walled area at Jufair. 5. There are two categories of people to be considered, the owners and the tenants who claim compensation for loss incurred since the pier was built. 6. It has been suggested by the Adviser to the Bahrain Government that compensation should be calculated at the value of the trap at ten years 1 rent assessed on an average, of the last five years and paid in proportion to the damage down. This would not apply to the claim of the heirs of the late Shaikh Abdul Rehman bin Abdul Wahab al Khalifah which has been dealt with separately. 7. I consider that it would be advisable to discuss the matter with the Adviser in the first instance in order to arrive at a decision regarding the method of assessment and if you agree suggest that Saturday the 18th would be a suitable date. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, 'i i Lieutenant-Colonel, Political Agent, Bahrain. t.D.O.No.1011 -3 /22 10th April 1936.

My dear Butler, You will remember that you mentioned to me during your last visit that you would like to invite &gt; the personnel of the Hoyal Air Force who visit Bahrain from time to time on their way up and down the Gulf to use the recreational facilities at Jufair. As arranged I asked the Shaikh whether he had any objection to the British personnel of the Royal Air Force having drinks with your British personnel in the Canteen at Jufair after using the recreational facilities there. The Shaikh readily agreed to their doing so t provided that no drinks are taken away* 2^ I am sending a copy of this letter to the Adviser to the Bahrain Government.

As arranged with the Senior Naval Officer, I mentioned the question of the Royal Air Force personnel using Jufair facilities including the Canteen to the Shaikh (Assistant Political Agent and Shaikh 'Abdullah were present). I explained that the men of the Royal Navy had a swimming bath and played football and hockey; that the Senior Naval Officer would like his men to offer these facilities to the personnel of the Royal Air Force who come through from time to time; that after playing games they would naturally like to give them a drink at the Canteen; that His Excellency had made the condition that no outside people were to be given drinks except occasional guests; that the Senior Naval Officer would like to treat these Royal Air Force personnel as guests if His Excellency had no objection. His Excellency and Shaikh 'Abdullah said that that was perfectly all right provided that they did not carry drinks away. I said that I was sure that they would look at it like that, but wished to ask them before doing so. 29-4-1936.No. 1093-3/22 The Political Agent, Bahrain, presents his compliments to:— The Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain- and has the honour to send him a copy of the undermentioned document (s).

To, H. B. LI f S. Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to inform you of the following facts in connection with the question of Jufair fish traps. On examining all the claims it was found that only two of the traps had been erected oy the tenants during last year therefore the question of compensation to the remaining tenants does not arise. The two in question are a. al I.Iushlakha, tenant Juma bin Haji Abaullah of Ghraifa who will be satisfied with Rs.70/- as full compensation. b. al Tenazah, tenant Mullah Abdel Hussein Din Abdullah al Ghrefi who will be satisfied with Rs.50/- as full compensation. I have not appointed a committee to report on these two traps as under the circumstances it was unnecessary. Regarding access it has oeen explained to owners and tenants that they are at liberty to use the shore in order to reach their traps but that tney must not cross the naval land. They appear to be satisfied with this arrangement. I request that the local authority should be iniormed of this arrangement.

These amounts appear reasonable. It is desirable that the compensation to the tenants should be paid without delay as they may make a demand, which would not be easy to resist, for compensation over the period during which the question has been under consideration# 10. I am most anxious that none of the local people, and especially the poor, should have any grievance over losses sustained by the establishment of the naval base at Bahrain, as any such grievance would afford a valuable handle to mischiefmakers and this view is shared by the Senior Naval Officer and the Adviser to the Bahrain Government. I hope, therefore, that you will feel able to recommend to His Majesty^ Government these proposals which have been framed with great care and consideration for economy. 11.

You may now have seen the Residents express letter of the 6th June, No. 4878 of 1936, of which we sent a copy to you on 2nd July. You will see that as a result of careful consideration by an expert committee, whose conclusions were subsequently considered in a meeting attended by the Senior Naval Officer and the Political Agent, the Resident recommends that the sum of Rs.10885 (to owners) plus Rs.l2C (to tenants) should be paid in compensation. I presume that if you agree you will now have to obtain Treasury sanction. You will, of course, note that the local authorities are particularly anxious that the payments should be made as soon as possible. Please let me know if you would like an official letter, otherwise I will assume that you are dealing with the matter on the basis of the copy of the Resident's letter and will let us know directly we can give Fowle the necessary authority. I am sending a copy of this letter to Brenan, Pirie and Hale, and a copy of the Bushire Express letter to the Treasury. Yours sincerely, (Sgd. ) M .J.Clauson.

Z. 4 d!L4/56 of the 5rd July to Seal atout the payment of compensation for fish traps damaged by the Naval pier at Jufair, I write to say that we have now received Treasury approval to make the payment recommended. The Treasury have however drawn our attention to case No.22 on the list enclosed with the Political Agent's letter of the 28th May which is peculiar in that ccmpensation is recommended although the trap was not damaged. We can find nothing in the papers to account for this reconmendation. In authorising the Political Resident to make the payments, would you therefore instruct him to satisfy himself, before payment is made for No.22, that the compensation recommended in this case is really justified ? If he considers that it is, we should be grateful to know the reason. I am sending copies of this letter to Brenan, Pirie and Hale. Yours sincerely, C . G. Jarrett.

MEMDRAFDUM: Reference the registration of the traps at Jufair, the compensation has now been paid to the owners for traps totally spoilt and for those partly injured. Thejjbitle deeds of the traps which were rendered useless and for which full compensation was paid have been cancelled and new title deeds are being issued to owners of partly damaged traps. A copy of these title deeds will be sent to youfj 2. Tn this connection I would point, out that ownership of a fish trap consists of the right to erect a specified number of fish traps within an area described by certain boundaries. The sea within the boundaries mentioned in the title deed of a fish trap is not the property of the owner of the fish trap but no other person is allowed to erect a fish trap within that area. The owner has no rights over the protection area described in his title deed and, for instance, he has no right to reclaim any portion of it or to erect any permanent buil ding on it, it serves only as a description of the situation of the trap and a protection area.

In reply to your letter No.166-3/22 of 19th instant calling for a report on the taking of photographs by one of our employees at Jufair, we would report as follows: Yours very truly, Four of our British employees Messrs.Heffer, Martin, Wardrop and Grant hired Taxi No,106 on 16th January, 1937 for the purpose of having a drive round to see what they could of the Island, During the course of this tour they entered the base at Jufair, and, not seeing any guard on the gate, did not give any thought to the fact that the taking of photographs in any Service Establishment is forbidden. In consequence Mr, Grant got out of the car and took a photograph or two. He was just preparing to return to the taxi on the way back to Camp when he was asked for his name by someone who apparently was the Clerk-in-Charge, He gave his name and address, and returned to the car, which was then driven back to the Bapco Camp, The four men concerned have expressed regret at the occurrence and requested permission to interview you personally in order to apologise and explain the circumstances. They would also bring the photographs taken to place than at your disposal. We have told them that we will endeavour to make this appoint ment for them and are accordingly trying to do so, in addition to writing this report. V/e trust that the above explanation will prove satisfactory, and would advise that the orders forbidding the taking of photographs in Service Establishments will again be posted on the Company Notice Boards and included in the regulations handed to all employees on their signing their contracts.

It appears that the fish trap which was known as Um Ratal was assessed for compen sation at two-thirds damage ^nd thi^ sum of money was paid. 3.

It appears to me tliat this particular fish trap is not causing inconvenience to the Yaval authorities and that they would probably be un illingunwilling at this stage to complete the pu ^hase.

Weigbtmari, Esquire, I.C«3.| Political Agent, Bahrain. To The Senior Kaval Officer, Persian ^Xilf Division, K. 3. Shoreham. Sir, I have the honour to address you on the subject of the Umm-Rattal fish trap, which was one of those examined by the committee of experts and was reported as being 2/3rd3 damaged (cf. paragraph 2 of your letter 490/1 dated the 8th January 1937). Compensation at the rate of two -thirds damage was assessed and duly paid through the Adviser to the Bahrain Government. 2. In paragraph 2 of your letter No. 490/13 dated the 23rd January 1937, you stated that the remains of the fish trap UmnwRattal had been satisfactorily removed. The Adviser to the Bahrain Government, however, in his letter No. 977 dated the 18th February 1937 stated that this fish trap was still standing and that it had been leased for Rs. 150/- for the season. In his letter No. 630 dated the 6th Cctober 1937 the Adviser now infoms me that the owners of the trap have agreed to s ell to His Majesty's Government the remaining undamaged one- third of the trap and has asked me to remit to him the sum of Rs. 1333-5-4 for payment to the owners. \ 3. It is evident from the above that there is consi- \ derable confusion about this trap. If it has been wholely destroyed/- T Idestroyed or if in your opinion it is necessary entirely to remove it, then it will be necessary to pay the balance of compensation amounting to a sum of Hs. 1333-5-4• If on the other hand one- third of this trap still remains but does not cause Inconvenience to the Maval Services then presumably it is unnecessary to buy out the remaining one-third and the matter can be dropped. 4# Will you be good enough to inform me of your views on this matter?

Srd December 1937. l, y Dear u, CJ With reference to your No. 2397-3/2E of 2511) November on the subject of the fish trap called Umd Rattal, from records in 'SHOREHAW 11 , the situation appears to be as follows. 2. Your predecessor's letter No. 3137-3/2B of 26th December 1936 addressed to The Political Resident stated that two thirds compensation had been paid for this trap. 3. Your predecessor's No. 182-3/22 of 21st January 1937, addressed to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, however, stated in paragraph 5 that arrangements were then heing made to pay full compensation, and this was confirmed hy the Adviser to the Government's letter No. 851/6 L.D./ 1355 of 24th January, also addressed to Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf. As these two letters were subsequent to your predecessor's letter of 2eth December 1936, I concluded that, in fact, compensation in full had been paid. 4. The situation at present is that the trap is not in existence and I confirm my predecessor's letter of 8th ^ January 1937, No. 490/l, that its re-erection should not be permitted as it would interfere with service requirements. &gt;i V)' H.

FISH TRAP 'UM RATAL'. : * ta ,• i Witb reference to your letter No.2619-3/22 dated --- -^LJoOtb December 1937. At the meeting arranged on 12tli January between the Superintendent, Land Department, Bahrain, and my Staff Officer, it was stated hy the former that there were no records in Bahrain of the accurate position of this fish trap. The estimated site was then inspected at low water and no signs of a fish trap were seen. ■A 2. In order to regularise the situation, it was then arranged with the owner and the Superintendent, Land Department, that the former should marK out with stakes the sites of 'Um Ratal ,, and also of 'Maqsusa', the only other unpurchased trap to the southward of the Naval Area, and to the East of the Pier. 3. This was done and the sites were inspected hy me on the 15th January in the presence of the Superintendent, Land Department. 4. As a result of this inspection it became apparent to me that there is little control eicercised as regards the delimitation of the sites of fish traps generally, the sites of 'Um Ratal' and 'Maqsusa' in particular hearing no relation whatever to those marked on the tracing in my possession, which, it is understood, was made out by the Superintendent, Land Department, himself. 5. The sites of 'Um Ratal' and 'Maqsusa 0 as inarKed out by staKes are such that the re-erection of traps in these positions could not possibly he permitted as they would seriously interfere with service requirements. Assuming that the position of the stages marljs the legal limit of the sites, it would now appear necessary to complete the purchase of these two traps. From such information as I have, it seems that one-third compensation will he required in each case to complete the purchase in full. I would he glad if you would taKe the necessary action to effect this. 6. With regard to the fish traps to the West of the Pier, I have observed that the positions of these are • gradually....FISH TRAP 'UM RATAL'. S.N^O.P .G 's No. 490.B of 191* Jan 38. gradually moving closer to tl^e Pier, and it is clear that any further movenient of these traps in an Easterly direction will seriously interfere with service requirements. This was pointed out by me to the Superintendent, Land Department who agreed that it would he reasonable to restrict any further movement nearer the Pier. I would he glad, therefore, if you would communicate with the proper authorities with a view to an understanding being reached as regards this. I am prepared to drive staKes to marK the limit beyond which these fish traps should not be moved. 7. When the above questions have been satisfactorily settled, there will be no fish trap sites remaining unpurchased to the Southward of the Naval Area and to the Eastward of the Pier, and there will thus be no necessity for any person to cross Admiralty land to reach any fish trap. I would therefore be glad if you would arrange with the Adviser to the Bahrain Government to withdraw from the owner of the traps 'Urn Ratal' and 'Maqsusa' the brass disc which was issued to him as a pass to cross Admiralty land when necessary, and to confirm that no other person is in possession of any such disc.

The Bahrain Government has no objection .. a to the purchase of 'Um Ratal' and 'Maqsusa' vo ^ although the owner is most unwilling to sel^ . The owner will be informed that he should not erect the trap at present. Since the question of the sale has been discussed the trap has not been erected* With reference to the traps on the west of the pier, the owners according to local custom have the right to put up thei^ traps at any position within^their boundaries, which are usually wide. If t he suggested line of , r demarcation is not within the boundaries of any ' - 0 r oTTne traps it can be put' up without reference to the owners of the traps concerned. If however the traps immediately west of the pier have boundaries which will be reduced by demarcation of a line tne owners should be con sulted and it is possible that they will demand some compensation for losing part of their area. A With reference to the Senior Naval Officer's letter, para 4, the Bahrain Government has never exercised any control regarding delimi tation of fish trap sites. The name of the trap is registered with a description of the boundary in the case of fish traps which have documents mentioning boundaries. No plans of fish traps are made nor do Government title deeds for fish traps contain plans ar maps as in the case /p* of land property. The tracing referred to was a rough sketch, without measurements or scale which was made during the discussion about the fish traps to enable the people who were dealing with the question to get an idea of the whereabouts of the fish traps. Refi/r' 2. 7 of the Senior ring the las^few days I Reference s ^letter have received complaints from the c.vner of two fish traps called Moharramia and Ummul Jamajam on the shore adjacent to the naval base, roughly opposite to Officers Club to the effect that nobody will lease the traps as tenants find it difficult to work the traps without passing along the shore on the edge of the naval area. The naval area is defined in the title deeds which they acquired when they purchased the ground and it does not include the foreshore. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant.

Sir, I have the honour to rotate that the Senior ? r aval Officer recently na e a request that it should be arranged to complete the pu chas ^ of two fish-traps n?3mely 'Urn l^atal* and ' laqsusn', since their existence interferes with service re uirenents. Both these traps were included in the list attached to my predecessor's letter No. 1446-.V22 ated the 28th ay 193b ( serial numbers 2 and 4), and it will be noted that in regard to^nn Ratal*it was stated that it has been wholely damaged. Subsequently it was reported that it had been c anaged only to the extent of two-thirds an; accordingly two-thirds conpensation amounting to Bs 2666-10-9 was paid as compensation. ( ,, namage ,, to fish- traps does not necessarily mean constructional damrge but may - and usually (-oes mean damage to utility by diversion of currents etc ). 2. The present position is that the owner of these two traps is anxious to rec- nstruct them, and that the &gt;enior ' aval Officer has the strongest possible objection to this 'or service reasons. In these circumstances the only course open, in my opinion, is for the Admiralty to provide the funds required or the outright purchase of both traps. In the case o 1 m ^atal 1 a further sum of fts 1333-5-3 will bo required ( this sum was actually refunded.— 2 — i.xo vide ny predecossor's No. 3137-3/22 dated the 26th Uevefftber 1936) : and for'Maqsusa 1 a further sum of ; 266/- wlll be needed. 3« Pending final s^ttlanent the owner of the traps has been forbidden to recons ruct them, but it is obviously desirable that the matter should be settled without delay.

In regard to the traps Moharramia and Umnul Jama jam it appears that both of these were included in the original list of traps said to have been damaged and that one of them at lea&amp;t was said not to have been leased2-2-2-- 28- leased for two years previously# TT o compensation was actually suggested for * difficulty of access' in e ther case • The present complaints therefore seem to be without serious foundation, in any case would it not be prefectly possible for* the owners or lessees to approach then from the north, thus avoiding trespass on the naval area ?.

This spar was being used as a fender at the steps at the end of the pier and was supported in place hy two chain slings. The slings were not taken. 5. This spar was formerly used as the spare mast for Rear Admiral Creagh's Dhow and it is therefore thought possible that it may have heen taken by a Dhow owner who required another mast. 4. The description of the spar was length approximately 33', worn in middle and has several scars on it. 5. The Clerk in Charge states that he will be able to recognise this spar provided alterations have not been made. 6. It is requested that the Police may be asked to make enquiries concerning this matter. CAPTAIN. SENIOR HAVAL OFFICER, PERSIAN GULF.

J • * s s' ^ / x ' JZ/i. On the 9th December 19^5 I discussed the fish trap question with the Adviser (l!r. Belgrave). We shall have to ask him to get certain further information:- (a) ve need to knov. the value of items 10, 11, 12, lv , 2yj and ?v, ; , and (b) which traps on the list are used by owners and which are let to tenants. The essential point is that all ask that they may be given ^ree access to the fish traps through the Naval area. ♦ This will need careful consideration but possibly the S. ,7 .0 may be prepared to let the fish trap ovners pass through with a pass of some kind. •' 7 . / number of fish tr ^ps mentioned in the Adviser's list are those belonging to the heirs of the late Abdul vahaian bi i Abdul V'shab. '^'hey have been romised that they vill receive compensation and in the Adviser's letter ^o: l?/6.Ij.r dated the 0 lst April 1334 the value of the traps vas assesser 1 at ^s. 7,600/-. '^'his is vastly more than h? s been suggested by the Committee and it is desirable that we should find out whether the heirs v.ere given any romise ss to the amount of the compensation. It is probable that the ^igures of the assessment are merely those at which the fish traps were assessed for the purpose of dividing ap the estate. 4, In general terms I am in favour of compensating the tenants as well as the owners for the following reasons, ^he owner, 1 think, would sry that he is buing deprived of his r&gt;. , , frUury ' isn trrp nnc t .at - ^ - ■ t x»ent merely represents the compensation to him for his loss of property; the man who ^ r 1 trap has more or less completely lost that3/22 2^ sourfte of iiqv^kuo and he should, therefore, be coit .^ enscite^. The amounts are small and I v/ould suggest that the tenants should receive one or tvo years 1 rent in order thft there might be no ^celing on the subject and because the tenants are mostly poor mem This viev is perhaps not completely logical but I think that it is suitable from the political point of viev. h Ad-;eA Memorandum i.o* ^'30 uat^u 7ia Ltc m^r - .&gt;3 g ii-oa S-N.o.

It was decided that the Adviser would ascertain esactly wno,of the tenants, had difficulties in getting to their traps and shd Explain that they would be permitted 'to cross the land end of the pier and also to move freely along the reef and beach hut not on the land/ (except that bit Just by the pier) .

Owing to the construction of the NpvpI pier -i c .t Juffair £ certc in number of traps owned by venous 1 ^ i individuals were demgged.The tenants of the fish traps at Juffair complained to the Mvispr,Bahrein Governmnt, of this incident and demanded compensation for the damage dene to the fish traps, / committee of experts in fish traps was appointed by the p ahrein Government to exrmine the complaints and to assess compensation for the damages dome to the fish traps(pages 91,95 and 96). / communication to the Political Resident, Bushire,was addressed to on the above subject with a view to recommend to His Majesty f s Government that the compensation of Rs.10,885/-so assessed by the committee .should be sanctioned and the amount be paid to the tenants of the fish traps without delay(pages 124,129,133-134)• The payment of the compensation so assessed wfs sanctioned by His Majesty's Government(pages 139-142,144),and the amount of compensation was forwarded to the /dvier for disbursement to the tenants vide pages 146-150 pnd 153. ' The /dviser while making payment of the compensation noticed that the fish trap w Um-Rattal w h8s been shown by the /gency as 'Wholly damaged' while in the list of fish traps sent by the /dviser to the /gency the trap in question was described xs by the committee as being 2/ord d£maged(page 71 and 129).The Adviser therefore refunded to the /gency the balance cost of l/3rd undamaged fish trap(pages 154-155).The sum of Rs.1,333-5-4,so refunded by the Mviser to the /gency w?s credited to Government (page 156). In February 1937,the /dviser was again asked by the /gency to stfte whether the fish trap 'Um-Rattal' was wholly destroyed or partly destroyed,if former being the case the balance so refunded by the /dviser will have to be paid to the owners(pages 173-174).The /dviser retried that l/3rd of the fish trap is still standing and the owner does not wish to part with it (page 180).In October 1937,the Mviserj^rhrein Government, informed the /gency that the owners of the fish tr?p 'Ura-Rettal' heve now pgreed to sell to His M?jesty*s 'Government the remaining 1/Srd of the fish trap and asked the /gency to send him Rs. 1,333-5-4,for payment to the ovners(page 201). The Political /gent,referred this matter to the Political Resident,Bushire, and pointed out that is the fs fish trap 'Um-Rattal' is not causing any convenience to the Naval authorities perhaps they would be unwilling to complete the purchase at this stage.He further suggeste that the matter may be referred to the S.N.O.Persian Gulf and his opinion sought as to whether the naval authorities are desirous of bjiying out the remaining l/3rd share of the fish trap 'Um-Rattal'. The Political Resident gave his approval to the above suggestion vide p.u.c.below.

' T ith e view to regulrrise the posit ion ti p. he n 1 Superintendent asked the owner of the fish traps o rark xiSxtxxactodseGX with stakes the sites of' f Ura-Ra + al f ' nd 'Vaasusa* the only oher unpurchased fish trap. This wrs done and as a sresult of inspection by the S.N.O. it was discovered that the sites marked with stakes hr -ve no relation whatever to those marked on the tracing prepared by the Land Superintendent. further assuming that the sites so marked are correct the 3.N.O. considers that the re -erection of these 2 fish traps cannot be permitted as it would inter with the service requirements.He therefore considers that the fish traps may be purchased completely. The S.N.O. further observes that the positions of the fish traps to thw West of Pier are moving gradually ts closer to the Pier and any further movements in the Easterly direction would seriously interfere ith service requirements. He proposes that steps may be taken with the proper authorities to come to rn under- standmgg that the movements of these fish traps sksmMx towards the Pier Should be restricted.If any so-t of understanding is agreed upon the S.N.O. is prepared to drive stakes to mark the limits ^eyon^ 'hicn fish traps should not be moved.
