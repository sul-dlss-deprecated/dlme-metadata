Minute Paper Department mi JUDGMENT AGAINST A BRITISH CONSUU UNPRECEDENTED CASE AT BILBAO , FROM OUR BILBAO CORRESPONDENT The village magistrate of Lujua on June 16 condemned the British Consul at | Bilbao to pay a claim amounting to 997 | pesetas (about £20) to a peasant named i Justo Aurrecoechea for carriage of earth ' and stones in connexion with work alleged to have been executed for the British cemetery. The Consul denied having em ployed the plaintiff as alleged. Judgment was first given for the plaintiff against the Consul, then Mr. Rees, on October 26, 1932, and an appeal was rejected by the Court at Bilbao. Mean while Mr. Rees had been appointed to Mexico and the case was brought anew against his successor. Mr. Bernard, when the same village magistrate confirmed the original judgment and imposed costs on the defendant in view of “ his temerity and , bad faith.' The case lias sonic unusual features, and is arousing considerable interest in legal circles. It is unprecedented for a magistrate of tnunicipal , status to judge the representative of a foreign 1 and friendly nation, for the Consul was not act ing in a private capacity, but as representative ' of the cemetery interests vested in the British Government since Queen Isabella granted land for the burial of British dead in Bilbao in 1860. It is understood that the British Ambassador in Madrid has made representations to the Spanish Government. The British colony at Bilbao take particular exception to the magistrate’s accusa tion of “ temerity and bad faith ” against the British Consul. The original British cemetery occupied a valu able site on the banks of the Nervion, and was sold in 1927 to the harbour authorities, the dead and monuments being transferred to the new cemetery, which is outside the town and is probably the finest of the British cemeteries in Spain. _ IfNPEXED A Tn any further communication on this subiect.-please quote »-&lt;&gt; esx I.S (-SSA 34 - / and address —not to any person by name, but to— fhe Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1.

(7) Judgment issued by the Court of Appeal of Kermanshah in the ease of Reuben Lalesar against His Majesty's Consulate, Kermanshah. 1935). This day, the 28th of Rsfand, 1311 (March 19th In the matter of the complaint on appeal of Agha Reuben Lalezar Parahmandian against the British Consulate in connection with the 'gharar* issued by the Court of First Instance of Kermanshah. The Appellant originally filed a suit in the abowe-mentioned court on the evidence of a paper dated 13/6/19 sealed by the British Consulate in Kermanshah and signed by the head of the Chancery of the same Consulate and other papers of the same Consulate claiming Tomans 660 as fine and Kraus 7666 as compensation for losses incurred on account of delay in refunding the original sum. The Court in question issued a 'gharar* (or interim judgment) after the completion of the preliminary ceremonies fixing the time for a session and the examination of the case, to the effect that the claim did not concern the defendant; for particulars, vide the decision already cited. This 'gharar' was served on the 2nd Axar Hah, 1310 (November 24th, 1931) on Reuben Lalezar, the Appellant, who appealed against it within the legal time limit. The case was therefore presented to the Court of Appeal of the Vestern Districts. The first section of the Court of Appeal convened a sitting, therefore, on the 28th Esfand Mah 1311 (March 19th, 1933) composed of the following two persons$ (Mirza Seyed Abdullah Khan Agha«2adeh, and Mlrza Seyed Hussein Khan Khatun»Zadeh), and considered the original /dossierdossier together with the dossier concerning the appeal case on the request of the appellant and the Counsel for the respondent (Dr. Musharraf Ifaficy) and returned the following judgment after due deliberation: Although by virtue of the circular published in Issue 16 of the Official Gasette, Consuls are not entitled to diplomatic privileges, the measures they take in the discharge of their duties and by direction of their respective Governments cannot be considered as their personal transactions which would justify the establishment of a legal case against them. Such a case would lie against their Governments and it would be settled through diplomatic channels. Hence, the claim of the appellant, concerning the actions of official duty of the Consul of the British Government 13 years ago does not lie against, or concern the person of Mr. Hoyland, the present British Consul. The claim should be settled through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs just as It has previously been prosecuted through that channel. The ’gharar’ against which the appeal haa been filed is therefore hereby corroborated. (Signed) Abdullah Agha-Sadeh. (Signed) Seyed Hussein.perform personal transactions such as purchase 9 sale, hire, letting, borrowing or lending money, etcetera. If a claimant alleges that as a result of the actlTities connected with the unofficial occupation of the said Consul hs has suffered certain losses, he can prefer a claim against that Consul in the local courts, and the circular of the Ministry of Justice published in Issue 16 of the Official Gazette of the Ministry recognises the competence of the local courts for dealing with such cases. But if, on the other hand, the action to which objection Is raisea by the claimant refers to the exercise of the official duties of the Consul or is occasioned because of tnls exercise, the claim cannot be taken up by the local courts because the case evidently concerns the Government of the Consul. If such a case Is heard in the local courts it would be tantamount to those internal courts having examined and judged actions and activities of a foreign Government and this procedure would be incompatible with the principle of independence and integrity of Governments, and International Laws have prohibited such a proceeding. Bearing the foregoing considerations in mind we must say that if Reuben Lalezar claims that in consequence of the personal actions of the British Consul in Kermanehah he suffered certain losses, he should prefer a claim against the person of the said Consul who in 1919 caused the losses, in which case my principal, Mr. Hoyland, the present Consul in Keraanshah, cannot justly be a defendant in the case.

It has unfortunately come to light that the fine was credited not to the Military authorities but to the garden fund of the Consulate, which was then under the Government of India. Although the garden fund appears to have been a self-balancing item supported by the sale of garden produce and from fines imposed by the Consul, I do not think we can now refuse to share the expenditure involved in the law-suit. We could not very well ask the Foreign Office to accept instead a share of the fine (5800 Krans at the 1919 rate of exchange), which would probably be cheaper! We have not heard yet the result of the reference to the Appeal Court. The case was to have been tried last September, but I understand from the Foreign Office that it was postponed and that they have not yet heard the result. They will send us any relevant papers which we have not had. It will be necessary now to ask the Government of India for their views on the question of sharing the expenses of the law-suit. Do you concur in the draft? Political Secretary . The papers below indicate that the fine was paid into the garden fund. But since this was a self- supporting fund, I do not think that the payment can properly be said to be a contribution ”to the maintenance of an establishment which is a joint charge on Imperial and Indian revenues”. Thus the fine uoes not appear to/ /ill to have relieved Indian revenues in any way, and so I think it is true to say that no part of it was credited to Indian revenues. Consul Hoyland says as much in his letter dated November 21st, 1932. Further, it is observed on page 23 of the enclosure to the Foreign Office letter that the military authorities demanded compensation for loss of their mules and were given it. It is not known from what Fund this compensation was paid or how much it amounted to, but it seems safe to say that ultimately the military authorities reaped the benefit of the fine. In view of this,and since the fine was levied on behalf of the military authorities, it would appear that the general attitude adopted in our letter No. 5023/32, to the Foreign Office was the correct one and, subject to any observations India may offer, I think we would be justified in maintaining it. *Minute Paper. politi gal Departm ent, I have discussed this with the Financial Department. Paragraph 7 of the Consul’s despatch (page 2) is not conclusive eviuence that the garden was wholly kept up oy the sale of produce and hy fines and in any case it must he admitted that the proceeds of the fine were applied hy an Indian Political officer to the upkeep of property for which the Government of Inaia were partly responsible. Also, I am not convinced that Lr. Greenhouse’s letter (page 23) is good evidence that the military authorities actually received part of the fine in view of what Itr. Hoy land says in paragraph 6 of his letter (page 2)^ or that the fine was only paid into the Garden Fund in the first instance and later paid over in mole or in part to the military authorities. Nevertheless I agree that on the whole it will he best to consult the Government of India, as the Financial Department suggest, without giving them a lead. It is just possible that the Government of India may have papers dealing witri^disposal of the fine as the Foreign Office suggest. Papers which explain the circumstances in which the hearing of the case in the appeal Court was pootponed are now attached (P.2.833/2 7 1t 1212 5C00 9.321401 5000 1132 P.Z.529/33. pol i ri GrtL Department Draft Paper.

Sir, With reference to your telegram No. 80 of August 5th, approving the retention of a Tehran lawyer of good standing to appear on behalf of His Majesty’s Consul at Kermanshah at the hearing in the Court of Appeal at Ramadan of the suit brought against him by Reuben Lalezar, I have the honour to report that Dr. Naficy proceeded to Hamadan on September 22nd, the appointed date, only to find the Court in the process of moving to Kermanshah. The circumstances are set forth in the note to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs of which I enclose a copy. 2. The expenses incurred by Dr. Naficy on this abortive journey amounted to Rials seven hundred and eighty, which I have naturally refunded to him. I should be glad to learn whether you would approve of my suggesting to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs that they in their turn should refund this sum to the Legation. I do not suppose that they would ever pay, but the demand might encourage them to be more careful another time. 3. The transfer of the Court of Appeal from Hamadan to Kermanshah was ordered by the Minister of Justice in the course of a recent tour of inspection. He apparently indicated that it should take place at once, but I do not suppose he intended it to be taken so literally that current work The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, Q.C.S.I., etc., etc., etc. The Foreign Office.work was not disposed of and no warning sent to litigants, 4, I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Consul at Kermanshah (No, 65).

Monsieur ]e Gerant, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that in the month of May last, Mr. Hoyland. His Majesty’s Consul at Kermanshah, received a notice informing him that a suit brought against him by a certain Reuben lalezar would be heard on appeal by the Court of Appeal at Eamadan on September 22nd, 1932 (31st Shahrivar, 1311). 2. Arrangements were accordingly made for Mr. Eoyland to be represented at this hearing by an advocate, and the advocate in question. Dr. Mucharraf Naficy, proceeded to Hamadan on September 21st and attended the Court of Appeal at the appointed time on the following day. 3. On arriving at the Court building, however, he learned that the Court had received instructions to transfer its seat to Eermanshah, that most of the archives had already been sent there, that the appeal of Reuben lalezar could not be heard that day and that the hearing would probably take place at Kermanshah some time in November. 4. I may mention that Dr. Naficy had heard privately before leaving Tehran that the Court of Appeal had received instructions to move from Hamadan to Kermanshah and had endeavoured to ascertain whether the Son Excellence Mirza Eassan Ali Khan Ghafferi, Gerant du Ministers des Affaires Etrangeres.the hearing would take place on September 22nd (£lst Shahrivar) as arranged. He could not, however, obtain any information on this point sufficiently definite to permit of his taking the risk of the suit being heard in his absence. At Kamadan Dr. Naficy learned that a telegram advising him not to come, sent in reply to a telegram despatched at his own request by the Ministry of Justice, had been delayed owing to the disorganisation caused by the move in the offices of the Court, and must have reached Tehran after his departure. 5. The fact to which I desire to draw Your Excellency’s attention is, however, that at no time either before or since September 22nd (21st Shahrivar) has Mr. Eoyland received any notice of the alteration in the time or place of the hearing of the case. Leaving aside Mr. Hoyland’s official capacity, I cannot but feel that in failing to warn one of the two parties to a lav^ suit of a change in the date fixed for the hearing of the suit, to say nothing of a change in the seat of the Court, the Hamadan Court of Appeal acted with great lack of consideration, and presumably without regard to the regulations on the subject. The omission of the Court to warn Mr. Hoyland has led to much inconvenience and unnecessary expense, with regard to which I am reporting to my Government. Meanwhile I shall be glad if Your Excellency will cause the attention of the competent euthorities to be directed to the irregularity that has occurred and to the gross discourtesy with which a British Consular Officer has been treated.6 • I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurance of my high consideration.

I consider it preferable, therefore, that you should refrain from raising with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs the question of a reimbursement of the sum spent on Dr. Naficy’s abortive journey to E&amp;madan.

J &lt; 'T* &lt; &gt; CL O o 2. It will be seen that, on the evidence of documents recently discovered by Mr. Hoyland in the archives of His Majesty’s Consulate, the fine levied on Lalehzar was not credited to the Military Authorities, but was paid into the garden fund of the consulate, and hence contributed to the maintenance of an establishment which is a joint charge on Imperial and Indian revenues. 3. Major Weir, as an officer under the direct supervision of the Government of India, rendered to them his accounts for the relevant period. It may be inferred, therefore, that the Government of India were cognizant of the manner in which the fine was disposed of. 4. In the light of the foregoing considerations, I am to express the hope that Sir S. Hoare may now see his way to approach the Government of India with a view to the sharing of such expenditure as the lawsuit may involve.

Sir, With reference to Foreign Office letter No. E 3908/ 43/34 of the 6th August enclosing copies of telegraphic correspondence with His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran regarding the engagement of a Persian advocate to defend the interests of His Majesty’s Consul at Kemanshah in the case brought against him by a Persian subject named Reuben Lalehzar, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to request you to draw the attention of the Secretary of State for India to paragraph 2 of Foreign Office letter No, E 6048/4062/34 of the 29th December 1931, in which it was stated that it might later prove necessary to consider the liability of the Government of India to bear the whole or a part of any expenditure incurred as a result of legal proceedings. 2. As Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare is aware, His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran was instructed in Foreign Office despatch No. 683 of the 19th November to ascertain if possible in what way the officer of the Indian Political Service who held in 1919 the post of His Majesty’s Consul at Kermanshah had ’ ' Krans. 5,800 disposed of the fine of five thousand, eight hundred krans received from Reuben Lalehzar, and in particular whether it could be shown that this sum, or part of it, had been credited to Indian revenues. In due course His Majesty’s Consul at Xejsm^nshah furnished a report ENCLOSURE IN WEEK V LETTER NO 234. in letter '°- from t cretary, POLITICAL ano SEGCE1 CEPf. IN CH* o r fiQE The Under Secretary of State, India Office. , a copy of.which was enclosed E 1163/43/34 of the 23rd March, to/4 to the effect that a part of the fine had been collected by the Sub-Controller of Persian Transport, that the remainder of the fine was not shown in Major Weir T s accounts, and that it was therefore probable that the part of it which had been collected by the Consulate had been paid over at the time to the military authorities who had collected the other part. It has since been verified that no part of the fine was credited to this Department in Major Weir’s quarterly accounts, and further that, as far as it is possible to ascertain, the accounts rendered by the India Office to the Foreign Office in connexion with the shared expenditure in Persia contain no mention of the fine. 3. It seems reasonable, therefore, to assume that no part of the fine was ever paid in to the revenues of this Department. If it was not eventually credited to Indian revenues, it was in all probability disposed of by the military authorities then in occupation of Kermanshah. It appears, however, that in 1917 a proposal was advanced, and subsequently approved, that fines imposed on hostile Persians at Kerman should be used in indemnifying friendly Persians. There is thus the further possibility that^if this practice became general, the part of the fine collected by His Majesty’s Consulate at Kermanshah was used on the spot for some such purpose and never brought to account at all. 4. From the foregoing account of the position it will be clear that there is but little prospect at this date of ascertaining with certainty in what manner the amount of the fine was eventually disposed of; and in these circumstances it would appear equitable that any expenditure which it may now be necessary to incur in connexion with the lawsuit m question should be borne in equal proportions by Imperial and Indian Revenues./Revenues. I am therefore to enquire whether the Government of India are prepared to share any expenses which it may be necessary to incur in this connexion. 5.

(T.4179/44/373) Cir cular. Foreign Office, May 17,1932. Diplomatic Immunity of His Majesty^ Hepresentatives Abroad and Members of their Staffs. Sir, CASES having arisen which suggest that members of the staffs of His Majesty 1 s Missions abroad are not uniformly aware of their position in regard to litigation in the courts of the foreign country in which they may for the time be serving, it appears to be desirable that the matter should be made clear to them for their guidance henceforward. 2 . I shall be glad if you will accordingly inform all the members of your staff that the diplomatic immunity which they enjoy from the local jurisdiction, being derived from the position which they occupy under you as Head of the Mission, must not be waived without your explicit consent, whether for the purpose of bringing proceedings against other persons or of defending actions commenced against them, or of giving evidence. 3. It is unnecessary for me to remind you that your own immunity as the King T s representative, from which that of the members of your staff flows, is really the international right of the Sovereign, and should not therefore be waived, whether on your own account or on that of a member of your diplomatic staff, without special authority in each case as it arises. Every such case should therefore be referred to this Office for instructions, with a sufficient statement of the facts to enable me to give it proper consideration. Gases which may arise as regards your clerical and domestic staffs need not in ordinary circumstances be referred to me. His Majesty 1 s Representative at Kabul. I4. I would add that the practice of His Majesty 1 s Government in the United Kingdom is not such as would allow them to support in a claim to diplomatic immunity any member of your official staff (e.g. a clerk or typist) who may be a subject or citizen of the country in which you are accredited and he or she is employed. This consideration does not, however, affect persons employed as servants, between whom no distinction is made by His Majesty’s Government according to nationality, though it may ol course be made by the foreign Government concerned, there being no complete uniformity of practice in this particular respect. 5 . The members of your staff are not entitled to claim diplomatic immunity for their own servants. I am, etc. JOHN - SIMON.X No* 110 Tehran , March 3rd, 1932.

Sir, With reference to my despatch No. 699 of December 13th regarding the suit brought by Reuben Lalezar against His Majesty’s Consul at Kermanshah, I have the honour to transmit to you, herewith, copies of two further despat ches from Mr. Hoyland. 2. You will observe that Mr.Hoyland cannot furnish any precise information as to whether the fine was eventually credited to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom or the Government of India. It seems probable that it was credited to the transport department of the military forces of occupation. 3. Mr.Hoyland furnishes copies of his communication to the Governor of Kermanshah asiced for in paragraph 7 of your despatch No. 683 of November 19th (E5399/4062/24), 4. In the decision which the President of the Court of First Instance dismissed Reuben Dalezar’s suit (see the encloaade to my despatch No. 699) mention was made of two circulars of the Ministry of Justice. 5.

The second circular, of which I also enclose a copy, directs that suits against persons mentioned in the first part of the earlier circular (Ho.326), that is to say members of the diplomatic corps, should be referred to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. This circular is numbered 17U27 (not 17077 as mentioned in Mr.Hoyland's despatch reporting the Judgement). 7. It appears, however, that Circular No. 17077 was issued in substitution of a circular issued a fortnight before which directed that suits against all persons mentioned in Circular No. 326 should be referred to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. This circular is No.13783 and I enclose a copy for purposes of record. 8. The fact that a corrected form of the circular directing that suits against members of the diplomatic corps should be referred to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs had to be issued probably explains why the President thought it necessary tQmention this circular at all. It seems possible that he read the circular in its original, uncorrected, form and thought that as the suit was brought against a Consul he had to refer it to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs : but at the same time quoted, rather inaccurately, it is true, the number of the second, correcting, circular. 9.

I am now waiting to hear from Mr. Hoyland v/hether there have been any further developments, hut in the meanwhile I venture to enquire whether I may assume that His Majesty’s Government will meet any legal or other expenses which Mr. Hoyland may he forced to incur in connexion with this suit and especially that they will compensate him in the event (I hope unlikely) of execution being enforced upon his private possessions whether within the Consulate premises or outside (for instance - the seizure of a motor-car). 3. I should also he glad of instructions as to the extent to which either this Legation or Mr. Hoyland can legally protest in the event of an attempt being made to enter His Majesty’s Consulate for the purposes of execution.

With reference to Mr. Lascelles’ despatch No. 29 of July 26th, regarding the claim of Reuben Lalezar, I transmit to you, herewith, a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs setting forth the legal position of Consular Officers in suits of this kind and indicating the course which you should follow. 2. In accordance with these instructions you should make every effort to prevent the case coming into Court hy explaining the situation to the local authorities as suggested in paragraph 7 and using the arguments adduced in paragraphs 5 and 6. It may be preferable, however, for you to postpone these steps until further attempts are made at service or a date is actually fixed for the hearing of the suit. 3. If notwithstanding your efforts, the case comes on for hearing, you should repeat the arguments adduced in paragraphs 5 and 6 to the local Court, through an advocate who may also make use of the arguments in paragraph 4. Should the Court, despite these arguments, decline to non suit the plaintiff, you should withdraw from further participation in the case, as indicated at the end of paragraph 7. 4. Should the Minister for Foreign Affairs address me on this subject I shall also reply in the sense of paragraphs 5 and 6. 5. I also enclose a copy of a despatch which I have addressed K.A.D.

I shall he glad to learn whether there have been any further developments in this case and whether the suit has been brought against the ’’Consulate*', as you state in paragraph 3 of your despatch No. 43 of July 10th, against the 'Consul” or against 'Mr. Hoyland'.

Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Despatch No. 41 of the 19th ultimo, with enclosures, relative to the claim of Reuben Lalezar. 2. The summons in this action is issued against 'the British Consulate' as defendant, service of the documents being ordered upon 'the British Consul' at Kermanshah. 3. I ascertained that the documents were still at the Adliyeh and it appeared that the central authorities to whom my refusal to accept service had been reported had instructed the court to obtain my reply in writing and if necessary forward the papers to Tehran. 4. I therefore addressed a communication to i-he Governor General of Kermanshah in the terms given in para.2 of your despatch under acknowledgment. The latter then suggested that I should sign the summons in the action as I had no right to refuse the service. I de clined to adopt the course and it was agreed with the Rais-i-Adliyeh that I should endorse the summons, over my signature, to the effect that 'this case does not 'concern me and I have furnished the necessary explanation 'to the Governor General in my letter No. 23 dated 7th 'Mehr 1310 (30th September 1931) which will be duly brought 'to the knowledge of the Adliyeh', when the Rais-i-Adliyeh His Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires etc., etc., etc., British Legation, Tehran. stated* i\ ) stated he v/ould refer the case and documents to the central authorities. 5. As this action did not appear to me to affect the case, whilst safeguarding against the necessity for legal expenses and possibility of execution, I have complied with the request. 6. I should add for your information that the at mosphere of the case has been a heavy one throughout, the authorities considering that I had slighted Persian sovereign rights by my initial refusal to accept service of the documents.

Sir, With reference to Mr. Do&amp;dCs despatches Kos.510 and 592 of Septemher 19th and October 17th, regarding the suit brought by Reuben Lalezar against His Majesty’s Consul at Kermanshah, I have to inform you that the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury have been approached with regard to the reimbursement of any legal or other expenses which Mr. Hoyland may be forced to incur in this connexion, and regarding the possible necessity for compensating him in the event of execution being enforced upon his private possessions. Their Lordships have also been asked for authority to incur such reasonable expenditure as may be necessary in connexion with any legal proceedings which may take place in the local courts. R.H. Hoare, etc. , 2. In paragraph 7 of my predecessor’s despatch No.495 of August 27th, it was stated that, if it should prove impossible to keep the matter in the inter-governmental sphere and to keep it out of the Persian courts, His Majesty’s Consul should, if necessary, explain the situation to the local authorities including the local court, after which he might properly disregard the process. I am now advised ohat, if it should unfortunately prove impossible to prevent the proceedings from being continued in the Persian courts, it will be preferable for His Majesty’s Consul to be represented during the proceedings and to contend that the action is in any case misconceived, seeing that he is in no way responsible for, and cannot be sued in respect of, the acts of his predecessor. If he were simply to ignore the proceedings, as previously proposed, Esq. , C.M. G. , etc., etc., Tehran.(TTo) proposed, there seems an increased likelihood that judgment will he given against him. It may moreover, he decided eventually to present a Claim to the Persian Government on the ground that any judgment holding Mr. Hoyland responsible is a denial of justice, seeing that, whatever the merits of the dase against his predecessor may he, there is no legal ground upon which he can he made personally responsible for his predecessor’s &lt;i.ctj and it will he more difficult to claim that the judgment is a denial of justice, if Mr. Hoyland has not first put forward his contention in the Persian courts. 3. I shall not fail to inform you when Treasury sanction has been obtained for the expenditure involved in defending the case before the Persian courts, and, in case of the contingency arising, in indemnifying Mr. Hoyland. 4. Mr. Dodd further enquired, in his despatch Ho.310 of September 19th, the extent to which a protest could legally be made in the event of an attempt on the part of the Persian authorities to enter His Majesty’s Consulate for the purposes of execution. I am advised that, if legal proceedings were to result in a judgment against the Consulate and an attempt were made to enter the premises for execution on the Consul’s private property (as distinct from the property of His Majesty’s Government^, a protest could only be made on the basis of the general lack of equity involved in proceedings against Mr.Consul Hoyland, in view of the fact that he ought not to be held responsible for the actions of his predecessor. It might be difficult for His Majesty’s Government to protest merely against the entering of the Consulate for execution, since for the reasons explained in paragraph 4 of my predecessor’s despatch No.495 of the 27th August, under the municipal law of this country0 country only the consular archives are regarded as inviolable under international law and custom. 5. It is perhaps a question whether, in order to avoid the likelihood of further difficulties and probable expense arising from this claim, it is desirable to authorise His Majesty’s Consul to endeavour to settle it out of court, if he finds that he can do so by merely handing over to the claimant the amount of the fine originally inflicted upon him by the British military authorities. This solution, if it could be arranged, would at first sight appear to have much to recommend it, particularly as it appears doubtful whether the imposition of the fine in 1919 by the British military authorities was in fact justifiable. At the same time, there are certain possible objections to an endeavour to reach a settlement on these lines. In the first place, the Persian Government have long been unwilling to settle the claims of any British subjects, however well-founded they may be, and there is still, therefore, considerable force in the view indicated in paragraph 5 of Sir Austen Chamberlain’s despatch No. 41 of February 2nd, 1925, when it was decided to delay a settlement of this claim on the ground that, if there are some Persian claims outstanding against His Majesty’s Government, there will be more inducement to the Persian Government to agree to some comprehensive claims settlement. Secondly, it is possible that Krans 5,800. the offer of five thousand, eight hundred krans, the amount of tne fine, may merely stimulate the claimant to press on legal proceedings in the hope of obtaining the full amount claimed, Krans 23,995. viz. twenty-three thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five krans. Thirdly, the settlement of this claim, merely bectuse the claimant has brought an action against His Majesty’s Consul in the Persian courts, may lead other claimants to enter actions against His Majesty’s Representatives in Persia on account of similar claims. The claims, also on account of fines imposed during the war, entered by certain Parsee traders of Kerman against\ * against Brigadier-General Sir Percy Sykes, which formed the subject of Mr.Dodd T s despatch No. 456 of August 25th, might, for example, be pressed against His Majesty’s Consul at that ^ town, if there were reason to suppose that this course might be remunerative. I shall be glad of your observations on this aspect of the question, but you will appreciate that no attempt to reach an out of court settlement, even if you consider this desirable, should be made before Treasury authority has been requested and obtained. 6. a further point to be considered is the possible liability of the Government of India to bear a part of the cost involved in connexion with this claim or with the action in the Persian courts. The fact that Major J.L.R.Weir, who was His Majesty’s Consul and Political Officer at Kermanshah during 1919 and who seems to have been concerned to some extent with the imposition of the fine, is an officer of the Indian Political Service, may h:-ive some bearing on this point. I shall, however, in the first place be glad if you will endeavour to ascertain, if possible, in what way His Majesty’s Consul disposed of the Krans. 5,800. fine of five thousand, eight hundred krans received from Reuben Lalezar in 1919, and in particular whether it can be shown that this sum, or a part of it, was credited to Indian revenues. 7. I shall also be glad to receive a copy or translation of the written communication made by Mr. Hoyland to the Governor- General of Kermanshah, as reported in paragraph 4 of his despatch No. 63 of October 6th. I am, etc., (Signed) G.W.Rendel. (For the Secretary of State)FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1. 16th December, 1931. Copy. No. 745. (E 6048/4062/34) Sir, I have to inform you, with reference to paragraph 3 of my despatch No. 683 of the 19th November, regarding the suit brought by Reuben Lalezar against His Majesty’s Consul at Kermanshah, that, the necessary sanction having been obtained from the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, I authorise you to incur such reasonable expenditure as may be necessary in defending any legal proceedings which may be taken against Mr. Hoyland in the local courts. Such expenditure will only be necessary if, in spite of all the action which is taken to prevent the case being entertained by the Persian Courts, and in spite of the explanations given to the Governor-General of Kermanshah in connexion with the service of the documents, the proceedings are admitted by the Persian Courts. Mr. Hoyland should confine his defence to the point that the action complained of is that of his predecessor for which he is not responsible, (see paragraph 2 of my despatch No. 683). He should not defend the case on its merits. His advocate may however, on his own responsibility as a Persian lawyer, argue that a British consul is not justiciable in the Persian Courts in respect of acts done in his official capacity (see paragraph 4 of my predecessors despatch No. 495 of August 27th). 2.

Sir, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to transmit to you, to be laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, the accompanying correspondence regarding the claim of a Persian subject named i euben Lalszar against His Majesty’s Consul at Xermanchah in respect of fines levied by the British military authorities in 1919, at a time when British troops were in occupation of the district* 2* Their Lordships will observe that the claimant la now endeavouring to sue Mr. Consul Hoyland, the present incumbent of the post, in the local Persian courts. The claim is one which had previously been raised by the Persian Government through the diplomatic channel, and every endeavour will accordingly be made by the British authorities concerned to keep the matter in the inter-governmental sphere. At the same time, it is impos/ible to ensure that the proceedings shall not be continued in the Persian court j, and it is therefore necessary to take into account the possibility that judgment may be given against His Majesty's Consul, a possibility which may be the more likely if His Majesty's Consul merely ignores the proceedings. 3. As regards the merits of the claim, the Secretary of State was definitely advised in 1925 that, if the ca come before a claims coramis;ion, it appeared probabl information available, that judgment would be given 1 His The Secretary to the TreasuryHie Majesty* s Government and that compensation would he awarded to the claimant. Although, however, the claim was thus considered to he reasonably dound in itself, it was decided to postpone a settlement, in order that it might form part of a proposed general settlement of all claims in dispute between the two Oovemments. The Persian Government had not for some time settled any claims brought against them by His Majesty 1 s Government on behalf of British subjects, and it was held that, if there were some Persian claim or claims of this nature outstanding against His Majesty’s Government, there would be more inducement to the Persian Government to agree to the establishment of a claims commission. 4. It is now a question whether, in order to avoid the likelihood of further difficulties, and even expense to His Majesty’s Government arising from the forthcoming proceedings in the Persian courts, it is desirable to authorise His Majesty’s Consul to endeavour to settle the claim out of court if he finds that he can do so by merely handing over to the claimant the amount of the fine originally inflicted upon him by the British military authorities. This solution, if it could be arranged, would at first sight appear to have much to recommend it, particularly as it is dotibtful whether the imposition of the fine in 1919 by the British military authorities was in fact justifiable. At the same time, there are certain possible objections to an endeavour to reach a settlement on these lines. In the first place, the Persian Government are still unwilling to settle any claims of 1 ritieh subjects, however well-founded they may be, and it is still desirable not to remove what might prove to be an inducement forKrans 5,80f^ Krans 25,995♦ Krans 6,800. * r for them to agree to aaoae general settlement. Secondly, It is pos ible that the offer of five thousand eight hundred krans, the amount of the fine, may merely stimulate the claimant to press on legal proceedings in the hope of obtaining the full amount claimed, viz. twenty three thousand nine hundred and ninety five krans. Thirdly, the settlement of this claim, merely because the claimant has brought an action against His Majesty’s Consul in the Persian courts, may lead other claimanta to enter actions against His Majesty’s Representatives in Persia on account of similar claims; and it has already come to the notice of His Majesty’s Legation that at least one such claim exists. The Secretary of State proposes, however, to consider this aspect of the question further in consultation with His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. 5. It is not clear, from the information at present available, whether any part of the cost involved in connexion with this claim or with the action in the Persian courts should properly be borne by the Government of India. The fact that Major J.L.R. Weir, who was His Majesty’s Consul and Political Officer at Xermanshah during 1919, and who seems to have been concerned to some extent with the irapesition of the fine, is an officer of the Indian Political Service, may have some bearing on this point. The Secretary of State proposes, in the first place to instruct His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran to endeavour to ascertain, if possible, in what way His Majesty’s Consul disposed of the fine of five thousand eight hundred krans received from Reuben Lalezar in 1919* unless, however, it can be shown that this sum, or a part of it, was credited to Indian revenues, it may be necessary to regard any/V any expenditure now incurred in consequence of the fine then imposed toy the military authorities as part of the war expenditure chargeable on Imperial revenues. 6. His Majesty’s Representative at Tehran has now enquired whether it may toe assumed that His Majesty's Government will meet any legal or other expense* which Mr. Hoyland may toe forced to incur in connexion with the suit entered against him in the Per lan courts, and that they will compensate him in the event of execution toeing enforced upon his private possessions, whether within the Consulate premises or outride. In the opinion of the eoretary of State, it is clearly necessary that Mr. Hoyland, who has thus found himself in a most difficult position for which he is in no way personally responsible, should toe indemnified for any such expenses and also for any loss which he may suffer personally toy reason of the execution upon his private property of the judgment of the courts. Although in this event His Majesty’s Government might present a claim to the Persian oovemment on the ground that any judgment holding him responsible is a denial of justice, seeing that whatever the merits of the case against his predecessor may toe, there is no legal ground on which Mr. Hoyland can toe made personally responsible for his predeceBSor’s act, nevertheless Mr. Hoyland’s right to toe indemnified personally toy His Majesty’s Government % should not in any way depend upon the issue of the claim against the Persian Government. I am to add that, with regard to the expenses which Mr. Hoyland may toe forced to incur in connexion with this suit, the Secretary of »tate is advised that it will probably toe desirable for him to toe represented during the proceedings and to contend that the action is in Hi anyany case misconceived, seeing that he is in no way responsible for, and cannot he sued in respect of, the acts of his predecessor. If Mr* Hoy land does not put forward this contention before the Persian courts it might he more difficult for His Majesty’s Government afterwards to claim that the judgment against him was a denial of justice. If on the other hand he succeeds in this contention and if the action is dismissed, some pert of the cost incurred by him would pre umably be recoverable from the plaintiff, but he ia clearly entitled to indemnification fro® public funds to the extent that he may be out of pocket as a result of the proceedings. I am therefore to enquire whether Their Lordships agree that His Majesty’s Representative at :ehran may be Informed that his assumption, as stated at the beginning of this paragraph, is correct, and I am to request Their authority to incur such reasonable expenditure as may be necessary in connexion with any le ;al proceedings which may take place in the local courts.

British military transport officers detained a portion of the goods in Kerind and the remainder at the customs depht in Kermanahah, where I was fined Ts.6 for each load, the total fine amounting to Ts. 580. moreover, during the detention of the goods their marketable value depreciated owing meanwhile to a fall in prices which involved me in a further loss on the sale of the goods of Ta.1839. When my claim for compensation waa referred to the Kargosar in Kermanshah for adjustment with the party concerned, he took the matter up with the British consul in Kermanshah who replied that, ae I was having my goods transported by a muleteer who was under a contract with the British transport officer©, the fine of Ta. 580 was imposed to reimburse them in the cost of hire of other mules to replace those which the muleteer waa employing on ay work. This reply I understand has been supplemented by a similar one from the British Minister at Teheran, to whom my case had been reported. I am compelled to say that the explanation offered by the British representatives is very far from being satisfactory to me, it being obvious that the responsibility in the matter should rest with the muleteer who undertook to do my work, and not with me who engaged him.

FOR’I an OFFICE, £,*♦ 1 (E 8401/5815/34) 2nd February, 1925. /S Sir, With reference to Mr. Ovey’s despatch No. 437 of September 11th last, relative to the claim of Reuben Lalehzar against the British military authorities, I am advised that the evidence at present available is insufficient to enable a judgment to be formed regarding the validity of the claim. 2. There are two elements involved in this claim. The first is whether the conditions existing in Persia in 1919 justified British military officers interfering in any circum stance with Persian nationals. If they did not, the facte of the case are irrelevant. The second element consists of the facts of the case, that is to say, whether Reuben Lalehisar had bribed the muleteer to transport his goode, whether the muleteer was under contract to the British mili tary authorities, and whether the claimant Tcnew that he was interfering with the British military arrangements. 3. To pay this claim as a good claim without indicating to the Persian Government the precise reasons which have impelled His Majesty’s Government to do so, would weaken the whole British case as to the right of the British military authorities to protect the British forces in Per&amp;im by such interference with local jurisdiction as they felt obliged to assume, rhe British case for military intervention in Persia rests upon the proved inability of Persia during the war to protect her own neutrality from violation by the enemies of Sir ercy Loralne, Bart., O.K. ;., GreatGreat Britain, and particularly by Turkey- 'rhis attitude it will b© nece eary to maintain. If, therefore, the claim is to be paid at all, the payment should be made in auch manner ae to make it clear to the Persian Government that Hie Majesty's Government, after careful consideration, have reached the con clusion that the British military authorities in imposing this particular fine were mistaken as to the facta of the case. 4. As rerarda the facts of the case, however, further elucidation is retruired, nor does it seem satisfactory that, although the incident took place five years ago, no attempt has apparently been made to collect and put on record in a form suitable for production before a claims commission the evidence without which it would be impoaeible to defend the non-payment of this claim before such a commission. The regulations described in part 2 of chapter 22 of the Consular Instructions apply in principle as much to claims by foreign ers against His Majesty's Government as they do to claims by British nationals against a foreign government. It is observed that Major eir in hie report enclosed in Mr. Monson's despatch Ho. 3o0 of July 28th, 1923, states that further Information might be available in the Consular Office at ^ermanahah from the records of the local transport office there at the time when the claim arose. I shall therefore be glad if you will cause a careful search for such records to be made by His Majesty's Consul at Kermanshah in order that all available information with regard to this claim may be collected. If the records produce any material evidence and therethere le no other means of establishing it on oath, the consul in charge of the records should swear an affidavit saying that he finds these records among the archives, it being the evidence relating to the claim in question* An affidavit to that effect by His Majesty's Consul would give the relevant papers some appearance of authority, and would pro!.* ,ly lead a claims commission to accept them for what they are worth. o. Unless, however, further evidence can be obtained, it appears improbable that His Majesty's Government will ultimately be able to resist payment of the claim of fceuben Lalehzar. In the event of the question ariain of the setting up of a claims commission between His Majesty's Government and the Persian Government to decide upon the numerous claims in dispute, it may prove of use to hold out the possibility of settlement of a claim of this nature as an inducement to the Persian Government to a ree to establish such a commission* If, however, you see a prospect of a satlBfactory settlement of the whole question of British claims against Persia without the establishment of a claims commlsolon,it might well become desirable to authorise you to settle this claim* But in present circumstances it appears preferable to delay the settlement of this claim, even if it is a good claim, until such time as the Persian Government show a willingness to arrive at a general settle ment of all claims in dispute between the two governments. MeanwhileKeanwhil© steps should he ts&amp;en to collect any further evidence which may he available* 6* Generally, in view of the possibility that resort may be had to a claims commission for the consideration of all outstanding claims, I desire to invite your attention to part 2 of chapter 22 of the Consular Instructions, and to remind you that much trouble, time and expense will ultimately be aavdd if claimants are given clearly to understand that they must prepare their claims in a form which would be suit able for presentation to such a commission, should it be set up* I am, etc., (For the Secretary of tate)1 British Legation G u 1 h e k July H6th # 1931.

A copy of iir.Hoyland 1 s despatch on this subject is enclosed herewith. 2. It will be recalled that in your despatch Ko. 41 (E8401/b815/34) of February 2nd, 1925, you instructed Sir Percy Loraine to cause all the available evidence existing in the archives at Kermanshah to be collected for eventual production before a claims commission. Mr* consul Cowan was la due course inatiucted to carry out the necessary search, but for some reason which is not clear from the files on the subject he appears not to have been able to reply until October 1928. A copy of his despatch Ho. 58, dated October 5th of that year, is enclosed herewith. From the tenour of this despatch it would appear that Mr*Cowan had been unsuccessful in his iearoh for evidence, since he confines hi self to gen railties. Major Greenhouse, who was Major heir’s successor at Kerm&amp;nshah in 1928 occupied a post on the Tehran ! taff of the -^nglo-Pereian oil Company, was next approached on the subject, and gave it as his opinion that the ease must have been sumEiarily dealt ?/ith and The Eight Honourable Arthur Henderson M*P*, The Foreign Office.I Offl i • F • A * i^Tcrn^n - To M.F.A. %y;'Tri&amp;zr; From &amp;•¥.*,.

In these circumstances it was decided by ilr.parr to await further developments on the Persian side. Copies of the correspondence with the Ministry for foreign Affairs which was exchanged during the course of the year 1929 is enclosed herewith. 3* On various occasions during this period the desir ability was considered of iratimating to|i the Persian *Aovern- nent that it would be useless to pursue the case further through the diplomatic channel, and that the matter must be reserved for settlement by an Anglo-Pereian claims commission. It v/as, however, decided that such a course might conceivably Jeopv*rdize the settlement through the diplomatic channel of British claims then being pressed by the Legation, and temporising X’eplies of the kind so freely indulged in by tne Persian Government were therefore returned* Apart, however, from the partial settlement of a claim against the Persian Government by looter -Lincoln, His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Mohammerah, it is, I believe, no exaggeration to say that no single monetary claim, put forward on behalf of a British or ’Iraqi subject by this -rogation during the years since Reuben Lalolzar’s case arose, has been admitted by the Persian Government; and in such circumstances there no longer seems any reason to delay the proposed reply* The Persian Government-3- Government have, moreover, at last consented in principle to the establishment of some sort of claims coraaission in connection with the General Treaty settlement -(see in this connection Sir Robert Clive’s telegram No* 238 of September 29th last). That bein# ao, find in view of the considerable number of ^itish claims outstanding, they could not reason ably take umbrage if a demand for the settlement of Lalah- zar’s claim were to be met by a proposal that it should be dealt with by the future claims commission* “ub^ect, there fore, to your approval I propose to reply in that sense if and when the Persian Government again approach this Legation on behalf of Lalehzar* 4. I am not altogether clear as to the legal issues involved in the attempt made by the Kermanshah 'Mlieh' Department to serve the documents relating to the suit on His 'Majesty’s Consul. impression is that a forei^a consular representative cannot be sued in respect of acts committed by his predecessors, and that if it is desired to redovor damages from such a representative, application must be made direct to the Government which he represents, settlement being effected through the diplomatic channel^ if possible, and by recourse to arbitration if that fails. I should be grateful for a ruling on this point as soon as possible: pending its receipt I am informing Mr.Foyland that I approve his action, and that for the present he should continue to resist all attempts to Involve the Consulate in a local suit, such a negative course should not prove difficult, but I consider it not altogether impossible, in a country where ignorance of international custom£ custom is reinforced by arrogance and extreme nationalism, that instead of again approaching this Legation the Persian Govemitont iruuj aacifle on ome form of direct retaliation against His Majesty 1 8 Consul : perhaps a temporary suspen sion of official relations between him and the Governor, possibly even the withdrawal of his exequatur. For this reason, while I realise that such forebodings may well prove to have been unduly gloomy' I shall be glad to be armed with more precise information regarding the legal aspects of the o&amp;ae. 5* A copy of my repl£ to Mr. Consul Hoyland, trans- fo Kermanshah Ko. ^‘3. m itted to you for purposes of record, forms the last enclos ure to the present despatch, of which a copy (with copies of the relevant enclosures), is being sent to Kermanshah* I have the honour to be with the highest respect.

British Consulate* Kermanshah, October 5th*1928 Sir* With reference to your despatch Ho. 44 of September 14th I have the honour to inform you that in the spring of 1919 Reuben Lalezar, through his agent at Qasr-i-Rhirin, Herun Casri, seized 86 donkeys which were under contract to carry petrol for the British troops* and had them loaded with his ovm goods* On arrival at Kerend the contractor reported the matter to his superior offlcei’ there, and the loads were stopped until a t fine of iir&amp;ne 50 per load, in all &amp;rano 4*3000, was paid* I am not quite clear who gave the order for the fine, but it was paid to Major Weir, then His ila4esty , s Consul here* X understand that lalezar clrdrae not only a refund of the fine but compensation for Iocs of profit owing to a fall in the price of Sugar* Moreover he states that it was not he who seized the transport, but his agent Harun. , 1 o this Major Weir replied that Lalezar hoped to make his extra profit by seizing transport under contract, while more honest merchants were looking for animals which were not engaged* As regards the responsibility of Harun* if I.alezar'o statement was correct* his remedy lay against him. In the circumstances Major Uoir refused to consider L&amp;lezar’s claim, and his successor Major F•S•Greenhouse did likewise* Myown opinion is that the fine wan justified and it certainly acted as a deterrent, as I have found no trace of any similar cases. Had punishment been foregone in this instance, there is no doubt that other merchants would have followed Lalezar’s example, and transport conditions would have Raymond rarr Esq*, Charged’ Affaires, Tehran* become impossible for our troope- 2 - troops* Whether restitution should be made to Lalezar is a matter of opinion, but I would point out that it would probably open the door to a flood of claims against the British troops for punishments inflicted in respect of other offences.

His Hritannio Majesty’s Legation presents its compliments to the Imperial Ministry for foreign Affairs and with reference to the honourable Ministry’s Note Verbale No. 3627 of June 13th, regarding the claim of Reuben Laiezar of Kermanshah, has the honour to point out to the honourable Ministry that this merchant’s agent at ()asr-i-Shirin, Farun Qasri, seized eighty six donkeys which were under contract to carry petrol for the British troops, and had them loaded with his own goods. This caravan was accordingly stopped at Kerend and was not‘ allowed to proceed until proper compensation had been paid by Laiezar for his high-handed action in seizing animals v/hich were already under contract to the British Government. If Balezar’s agent acted without his employer’s orders, then Lalezar’s remedy clearly lies against him. His Britannic Majesty’s Legation is unable to admit that Laiezar has any claim against His Majesty’s Government and the Imperial Government will no doubt agree with this view.Enclosure Ho. 5 in Tehran despatch Bo. 391 dated the 26th July, 1931.

The Imperial Ministry for Foreign Affairs has the honour to acknowledge the receipt of His Majs sty’s Legation’s memorandum of iChurdad 20th last (June loth 1929) Ho. 217, in connexion with Rouben Lalezar’s complaint. It is imagined that Hia Majesty’s Legation has not completely paid attention to the precedents of the case : 'because the gist of the memorandum under reply was formerly intimated 'by the Legation and sufficient remarks purporting to the illegality of the action of the British troops in their confiscating the goods belonging to Reuben Laiczar and their receiving money from him were conveyed to His Majesty’s Legation in this Ministry’s memoranda of 29/7/1301 and 29/9/1301 (October 22nd and December 21st,1922) Hos. 1697 and 5252 respectively. After due reference to the above-mentioned memoranda, the Legation Authorities would evidently agree that the responsibil ity of transporting others’ goods with animals under contract of the troops in question will fall on the owners of the animals jraxiansful who have broken their contract and that there remains no lawful reason by which goods belonging to Reuben Lalezar could legally be confiscated or money exacted from him for the so-called losses. While inviting the attention of His Majesty’s Legation to the above circumstances, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs trusts that appropriate steps would very kindly be taken as soon as possible with the authorities concerned with a view to paying the money belong ing to, and the losses incurred by Reuben Lalezar, so that the settlementsettlement of this question and the vindication of the rights of the man may not he delayed any further.

Fauohille (Droit International Public), after stating that in France,Germany and many other countries foreign consuls are amenable to the 'jurisdiction repressive' of local tribunals, says: 'II en est toutefois autrement si le 'consul a agi dans sa quality official'. The Pevue General# de Droit international Public (Vol.19.p.362) remarks that it is generally admitted, 'en jurisdrudence comme en doctrine' that consuls, not possessing a diplomatic character, cannot therefore claim the immunity from civil and criminal jurisdiction enjoyed by diplomatic officers, 'a moins toitefcia 'que le fait a raison duquel il sont recherches ne se rattache 'directement a I'exercice de leur mission offioielle'. 2. A case supporting these general statements occurred in Prance in 190C when the French courts refused to enter tain a suit brought against the British vieo-consul at Depp# for slander, the defence being that the remark# complained of were made by the vice-consul in his official capacity and in the conduct of consular business. The following were among the principles laid down in the case. (1) Les consuls doivent jouir d ? une certain© immunite personnelle tant qu'ils restent dans les limites de leurs fonotions officielles et que I'ordre public n’est pas compromis. fii) II nd s’agit pas la d , une exemption de juridiotion, mais d f une immunite essentielle qui procede de 1 * institution meme des consulats et qui est com mon dee par les regies de la courtoisie internatiom le.

A eonsHi's immunity frasooriminai Jurisdiction was one of the questions discussed by the committee of experts, set up under the auspices of the league of Nations, for the progressive codification of international law, on© of the conclusions of this committee was that consuls enjoyed iaasmnity from civil jurisdiction only In connexion with the exercise of their functions* As regards criminal immunity there was difference of opinion, rhe Italian and German representatives, for example, were of the view that a consul should enjoy criminal immunity in respect of acts performed in ttx* exorcise of his functions. The British representa tive considered that the existence of a crime committed in the exercise of a consul's proper functions was inconceivable that there was no criminal immunity for a consul, but that it would be desirable for governments to grant bail in suitable oases if the consul was arrested. The rinoiple that consulsdid not onjoy Immunity In criminal affaire was accepted by the committee by a majority vote* 5* There appears therefore to be no universally accepted principle in international law regarding the criminal immunity enjoyed by consuls* but many states have agreed between themselves* by consular conventions* upon the extent of immunity to be granted* The following examples deal with conventions concluded by Germany and France* 6* Germany-i tonla* 19£5 * State Authorities may only execute legal warrants in the consulate with the consent of the chief consular officer* except for the prevention of or prosecution for a crime or offence punishable under the laws of the country with imprisonment for not less than 1 year (Art*6)* Consuls shall not be subject to the jurisdiction of the state in which they reside officially as regards the carrying out of their official duties (Art.10): G vmtmj -Uuasla» 19^5 . Consuls-general* consuls and vice-consuls shall not be amenable in respect of the performance of their official dutiea to the jurisdiction of the country in which they have their official residence (Art.10).

(Art.11). Germanyirfcrmagy-Balkariaa 19II &gt; Gonaule are not sublet to the jurisdiction of the state in which they reside in respect of their official action (Art*3)* When a consular officer is a subject of the contracting state by which he ha© been ap. ointed, he nay not be subjected to preliminary arrest, provided that the oase does not relate to an offence punishable by death or penal servitude (Art*9)* 7* Franoe-Lat^tft^1950 * B article S consular officers !, n© ©eront pas justiciables de© autorites judiciaires et M administrative© de l f £tat de residence b raison des actes (&gt; de leurs fonctions acoomptea par eux dan© les limitea des 'attributions (i.ui leur ©ont reoonnues par la present© con- ’ l vention• ,, By article 4, consular officers de carrier© A u ne pourront §tre mis en etat d'arroatation preventive, 1f sauf pour lea infraotions punisables d’apres la legislation 'locale d*un emprisonnement d'un an ©u moin©.' The same principles are embodied in the conventions consluded by Fiance with Poland (19f5) and Yugoslavia (1929). 8. France, therefore, appears to have n cognised, both in her jurisprudence and in consular conventions, the immunity of foreign consular officer© from local jurisdiction in respect of acts done in the performance of their official duties* Germany and certain other countries grant the same privilege by consular conventions* 9# A© regards the attitude of His Majesty's Government, e case occurred in this country in 1927 in which the Greek consul was involved and had judgment give against him for £2,600, and in connexion with which the Gx'eek Minister expressedexpressed, the opinion that something ought to be done to protect consular officer® against anj r ©laim in the court© conoerni^ acts or omieeione in Vrie fulfilment of tlieir Official duties* After investigating the case, the Foreign Office wrote a letter to tho Greek Minister in which the following' passages appears- 'No foreign conaular officer in England can be made liable in an Kaglish Court unleac. he transgreaBee in some the law of this country, . The law of this country does not oomamnd that any foreign consul should perform the duties entrusted to his government, oo that it does not appear possible that a foreign consul could be liable in the English courts for any omission of any part of his consular duties * Uor Is tliio case any warrant for the view that any act honestly done in the ordinary course of consular duties could be contrary to English law# It is ~—- the practice of governments not to Impose dutie© on , their consular officers which would be inconel a tent witli the law of the country where they live and ear** fully to frsrae their inatmctiona accordingly# M The Qfr&amp;e Was considered to afford no ground fox* any appro— hencsion© on tlie ccox'o of a foi*ei| 3 tt consular officer in linglsnd being made liable in an iinglish Ooui't to pay dmiagee in respect of ea^-' act genuinely and properly per formed in fulfilment of the official duties usually per- formed by eons^ilar officers, 1 • The diecuaeions at Oeneva of the committee for t&gt;ie codification of international law ©how that the immunityor conmile from local ^Juriadiction for rote don© in their official capacity is not a universally accepted principle.
