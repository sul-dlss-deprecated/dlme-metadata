(E 4015/4015/91) Dear Morris, \\ v Glutton has passed to me your letter I,Mi5334/41 of the 2nd July about the export of tobacco to Arabia. Though smoking is contrary to the tenets of Wahhabism, it is fairly general in the Hejaz and is increasing in Nejd. But I do not suppose that the cessation of the export of tobacco from the United Kingdom to Saudi Arabia will cause any great hardship to the inhabitants, few of whom,except in the larger towns, can afford tojbuy English cigarettes. In view of their principles, the Saudi Arabian Government could not object if we decided to discontinue exports. The Persian Gulf and Aden are the concern of the India Office and Colonial Office respectively. I ai? therefore sending copies of this Jetter and of your letter under reply to Curson at the India Office and James at the Colonial Office, who will no doubt let you have their views• Yours sincrely, W.A.Morris,Esq., (sd.)

Dear Glutton, 2md July 1942. hs I think you know, the exports of manufactured tobacco from thisbountry have fallen heavily, partly because Malaya and other important markets have disappeared, and partly because we have got the trade to cease exporting to India, South Africa and various other countries that can supply themselves. One of the principal remaining destinations of our exports, is Arabia and the quantity going either through Aden or into the Persian Gulf is greater than before the war. \. The maintenance of commercjaL exports of manufactured tobacco costs us dollars and shipping to bring the leaf here, and we are anxious that no unnecessary export shall go on. I have heard from the trade that wartime conditions bring increased propperity to many of the inhabitants of Arabia, who thereupon seek to spend some of their new purchasing power on British Cigarettes. This may be a sufficient explanation of the increased demand, but I am doubtfulfchether there is any need for us to continue to export these large quantities, and I shall be glad to know whether, in your view, there will be any objection to our telling manufacturers that they must stop exporting to Arabia, except cigarettes and tobacco for the troops, and possibly, normal quantities to Aden.

S-324(l), dated the 24th September 1940 on indents and delivery dates, the following revised instructions are issued for the guidance of indentors with regard to the procedure to be adopted for indicating or franking the Priority on indents. ~ (a) Every indenting authority for goods and services will be fntitled to mal^ his order or application 'Urgent 1”. 'Urgent 2' or 'Urgent 3'. This relates only to demands within --the Department itself and authority to mark orders Urgent 1 or 2 will be restricted to certain individuals whose names will be notified. 'Urgent 1' will be confined, to matters which have an Immediate operational significance, and implies despatch by the quickest methods. 'Urgent 2' to those which are so important that it may be desirable to hold up other ord.ers and 'Urgent 3' to those which should be completed with the utmost expedition. This last category will not apply to orders placed in the nonnal course of provisioning. If the indenting authority has reason to consider that the departmental grading described above will not be adequate and that his demands will clash with those of another depart ment or organisation under its control, he may apply for the necessary priority. He will do this stating the reasons which necessitate his action, through the Principal Supply Officer and Deputy Principal Supply Officer, Secretaries to the Government of India, Directors General and Deputy Directors General in the Supply Department, as the case may be, who, in their turn, will approach, if necessary, the superior priority authority. The application should pass through the supplying agency in order that the superior priority authority may have the information required on which to base a decision. The superior priority authority or administrative officer concerned will at his discretion, after consulting the various autho rities concerned, including if necessary the Secretary, War Pesources Committee of Council ? meet the wishes of the indentor as far as possible. The superior priority authority is alone competent to issue instructions to the supplying agency as to the relation of any parti cular demand to others that have been, or may be, made. On no account will subordinate officers, not authorised In writing to do so, issue instructions as regards priority either to the local representatives of other departments of Government or to manufacturers. ' (b) When the Department concerned is unable to accept the decision of the superior priority authority, it can appeal against it to the Executive Council if the issue is comparable to those which would normally be referred to Council, or to the War Resources Committee of Council in the normal case. In the latter event, the Secretary should be notified and will be responsible for carrying out any preliminary enquiries necessary before the matter comes formally before the Committee. 2. A chart showing the complete organisation for the control of priority policy is enclosed for your information. i 3. A list of Controllers and other Administrative Officrs executing priorities is also enclosed. 4. Comdbiin^fc are being received that indentors do not give definite delivery dates, but still use such terms as 'immediately', 'as early as possible' etc. This may result in storesr not being made available to the consignee at the time they are actually required by Mo. 8-43(601).

The Government of India do not appear to appreciate the difficulties of their gazetted and non-gazetted staff stationed in Persia and the Persian Gulf. Hitherto we have, apart from the first year of the war, obtained the imported goods in question from India. This has been necessitated since none of these goods are stocked by shops at Khorramshahr, Bushire ? Bandar Abbas and Keraan and only rarely and in limited quantities at Muscat, Kuwait and Bahrain, fruit and vegetables, except for poor quality 'brinjals' and I^dy*s fingers', are unobtainable at all these places for several months in the year. 3. There are the following strong objections to our importing the goods in question from the United States of America or the United Kingdom. (a) Since it would be clearly in-advisable for any member of the staff to place an order in the United Kingdom or the United States of America before being posted to a station under the control of this Residency he would have to remain without the various stores in question for a period of not less than six to twelve months depending on the shipping situation. (b) Officers holding Consular posts in Persia are entitled to import goods into Persia free of duty only during the first nine months of their tenure of office. After the expiry of this period they are liable to pay very heavy customs duty. The enforcement of the new order forwarded with External Affairs Department endorsement No.l5(3)-W/43 dated the 16th October will mean that any officer whose period of customs franchise expires before June 1944 will almost certainly have to pay Persian customs duty since he cannot expect to obtain the goods from the United Kingdom or the United States of America within six months. (c) I understand that as British subjects on principle at least, we are not supposed to have dollar credits and if this view is correct I am unable to see how we are expected to make purchases in the United States of America. (d) Even if the view expressed in para 3(c) is incorrect it is not fair to ask members of the staff (who have no trade connections with the United States of America) to pay heavy insurance and freight on small consignments, to run the risk of losing them and in any case to wait for between six and twelve months before they reach the Persian Gulf. (e) Presumably Indians existing quota of the imported goods in question has been fixed with reference to Indians imports in previous years. Since the latter must have included the goods re-exported to members of the Residency staff in the Gulf it would only be reasonable for us to continue to obtain our supplies- from India. 4. Por the reasons explained above I strongly recommend that the orders forwarded with External Affairs Department endorsement No.l5(3)-W/43 dated the 16th October, 1943, be waived in the case of the staff under this Residency. Owing to the very high cost of living, difficulties in communications and the increased hardships caused by the war to those stationed in the Persian Gulf it is necessary that they should be able to obtain the essential stores from India. I understand that the Anglo Iranian Oil Company have been permitted to obtain such stores from India and if this is correct it would be more than ever anamolous for Government of India servants to be prohibited from securing the same facilities.- •' , DEPARTMENT OP COMMERCE NOTIFICATION Commerce—-War New Delhi, the k}5th March 1944 No. 91-C.W.

RESOLUTION Tariffs New Delhi, the 3rd November 1945 No. 218-T(55)/45. —In the statement on industrial policy issued by the Government of India on the 23rd April 1945, it was announced that, pending the formula tion of a tariff policy appropriate to the postwar needs and conditions of the country and the establishment of ipermanent machinery for the purpose, Government would eet up machinery for investigating claims from indus tries, which have been started or developed in war time and which are established on sound lines, to assistance or protection during the transition period. A press communique issued on the same, date invited industries to address their claims to the Secretary to the Govern ment of India in the Department of Commerce. '2. Several industries have accordingly applied for assistance or protection, and on a preliminary examina tion of their claims, the Government of India have come to the conclusion that applications submitted by the fol lowing industries call for a detai’ed examination: — (i) non-ferrous metals, including antimony; (ii) grinding wheels; (ni) caustic soda and bleaching powder; (iv) sodium thiosulphate, sodium sulphite anhydrous, sodium bisulphite; (v) phosphates and phosphoric acid; (Vi) butter colour, aerated water powder colour; (vti) rubber many fa'••in res; (viii) fire hose; (ix) wood screws; (x) steel hoops for baling. Other applications are under the consideratiou of Gov ernment, and further action in then’ case will be taken in due course. 3. In addition to the industries which have applied for assistance or protection, there are certain industries the starting of which was considered essential by the Gov ernment of India under conditions created by the war. Early in 1940, Government announced that specified in dustries promoted with their direct encouragement during war-time might feel assured that, if they were conducted on sound business lines, they would, by such measures as Government might devise, be protected against unfair competition from outside India. In accordance with this decision, the following industries have been given an assurance of protection against unfair competition after the war:— (i) bichromates; (ii) steel pipes and tubes up to a nominal bore of 4 inches; (iii) aluminium; (iv) calcium chloride; (v) calcium carbide; (vi) starch. Of these industries, only those engaged in the maiy^ facture of bichromates, calcium chloride and starch h^'. so far applied for assistance or protection during cne transition period. The Government of India consider that the applications submitted by these three industries also call for immediate investigation. 4. For the purpose of these and any subsequent investi gations, the Government of India have decided to set up a tariff Board for a period not exceeding two years, in the first instance. The Board will consist of: — President Sir R. K. Shanmukham Chetty, K.C.I.E. Members Mr. C. C. Desai, C.I.E., I.C.S., Prof. H. L. Dey, D.Sc. (London). The Board will include one more Member whose name will be announced shortly. Mr. Desai will act as Secre tary to the Board in addition to his duties as Member. 5. The Tariff Board is requested to undertake, in such order as it thinks fit, the investigation of claims put forward by the industries specified in paragraphs 2 and 3 above. In the case of each industry the Board will, after such examination as it considers necessary, report whether the industry satisfies the following conditions: — (1) that it is established and conducted on sound busi ness lines; and (2) (a) that, having regard to the natural or economic advantages enjoyed by the industry and its actual or probable costs, it is likely within a reasonable time to develop sufficiently to be able to carry on successfully without protection or State assistance; or j».

(File No. 60-E.I(5)/45) New Delhi, the 8th November, 1945. Subject : REVISION OF THE EXPORT CONTROL NOTIFICATION . Consequent on the termination of war, the position regarding export of various controlled commodities has been examined in detail and it has been decided to decontrol a number of items which it was considered unnecessary to control any longer and also to liberalise the export of commodities which were subject to severe restrictions hitherto. A revised export control notification has accordingly been issued in the Gazette of India Extraordinary dated the 3rd November, 1945. A copy of the notification in question, together with a copy of the Press Note, issued on the subject is enclosed for information. 2. The basis on which' the export of the commodities newly included in Part D of the revised schedule to the Export Control Notification should be regulated is under consideration and detailed instructions on the subject will follow snortly. In the meantime, full particulars of any applications that may be received in respect of these new commodities may be forwarded to this office in the form of a monthly statement in duplicate. The first statement should reach this office before the 25th of this month. No exports of such commodities should be allowed by the Export Trade Controllers pending instructions from this office. The export of the commodities that have continued to remain in Part D should be allowed on the basis of existing instructions until further order*. 3. This circular is intended for official use only and should not be reproduced verbatim in any trade notices and copies should not be given to members of the public. But there is' no objection to the issue of suitable trade notices based on the instructions contained in the circular. Sd. K. Srinivasan, Assistant Chief Controller, for Chief Controller of Exports.

OBJECTS OF WAR-TIME CONTROL Export Control was established during the war for the following purposes s 1. Conservation of supplies required for the prosecution of the war; 2. Prevention of essential or key commodities reaching the enemy; and 3. Conservation of essential consumer and other goods in short supply in India. Although with cessation of hostilities the first two considerations have lost tneir importance, the third continues to remain as valid as at any time, at least in respect of a large number of commodities which are in short supply. Moreover, some items continue to be scarce all the world over and the distribution of these has to be regulated carefully with a view to ensure an equitable distribution of available surpluses among importing countries. NEED FOR LIBERAL EXPORT POLICY Nevertheless, Government have felt the time has come for a comprehensive review of the Export Control policy with a view not only to rebuild the old export trade but also to capitalise the present opportunities and develop old markets and cultivate new ones. The object is not only to revive the pre-war trade in agricultural products but also to market abroad, particularly in the adjoining countries, the products of industries that have developed in the country during recent years. As a result of this review, numerous items have been freed completely from control and it is proposed to allow exports of many others much more freely than hitherto. In certain cases, even in regard to relatively scarce commodities, limited exports will be permitted if, on general grounds, such a course is considered necessary for maintaining contacts with Indian natural or old markets. ONE HUNDRED COMMODITIES ALTOGETHER DECONTROLLED More than one hundred commodities have been removed from the list of controlled items. They include natural indigo, a number of chemicals and chemical preparations, scientific instruments of indigenous origin, certain classes of containers when used as containers, pyridine, cashew nuts, certain gums and resins, kapok, lac, cigarette and jewel cases made of wood, articles mainly or wholly made of mica, animal oils, many essential oils, perfumed spirits, soapnut and bilawan nuts, talc, cigars, cigarettes of indigenous manufacture and unmanufactured2 #r tobacco including flue-cured tobacco, toys and requisites for games and sports if not wholly ana mainly of rubber, fibres for brushes and brooms, hairs of all kinds, and animal bladders, guts and casings, furs and fur SKins}. a number of metals and ores (aluminium ore, antimony ore, chrome ore and metal, iron ore, maganisite, manganese ore and manganese, zinc ore, etc*), raw cotton, Turkey red oil, essential oil seeds, spices of all sorts excluding pepper and cinnamon and condiments and curry powder. COMMODITIES UNDER COMMERCE DEPARTMENT CONTROL More than 20 commodities, the export of which was hitherto totally prohibited, have now been transferred to control by the Chief Controller of Exports who will small quantities to be exported. This category includes agar-agar, bees wax, certain classes of buttons, candles, cinematograph films, cutlery, glue, and raw materials leather manufactures including footwear and suitcases, ink, spectacle frames, Vitamin A preparations, Pashmina shawls, carpets, and floor rugs. Advantage has also been taken of this opportunity to transfer some commodities controlled by other Departments to the Commerce Department. These items include many kinds of drugs, Hops and Hop products, abrasives, bitumen, carbon black, some chemicals, many instruments, apparatus, rubber shoes and liquors. In respect of these and other items a more liberal export policy has been formulated and will now be applied. Copied. G.A.M.No.285-36/1(a) POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN. DATED 24TH JANUARY, 1946.

According to the instructions contained therein, an export permit is not to be insisted upon in respect of personal Jewellery and it would be sufficient if the passengers are advised to obtain a permit from the Reserve Bank where such a permit is necessary. It is now stated for your information that this decision applies equally to passengers proceeding to Middle East, Persian Gulf and Ceylon. / 2. The Reserve Bank have drawn attention to the fact that there is a tendency amongst the Export Trade Controllers to mark export permits of passengers carrying jewellery M subject to permit from the Reserve Bank of India”, without considering whether or not a permit is really necessary in each case and that this practice throws unnecessary work on them. It is, therefore, requested that you should ask the passenger to obtain a permit from the Reserve Bank of India only in those cases where a Reserve Bank permit appears to be necessary in the light of their regulations us set out in their circular letter No. E.C.948/68-45.G dated the Slst May, 1945.

Copies of this Notification and subsequent amendments can be purchased from the local Export Trade Controller of the Manager of Publications, Civil Lines, Delhi• It is important to note that commodities not scheduled therein ao not require any'export licence and can be shipped without reference to the export control auihorities . 3. The Notification, it will be observed, is divided into four parts and the authorities to whom applications for export should be made are indicated in the superscript of each part. The following coimnents may be of use to the public : - PART 'A' 4. Tills includes articles the supply position of which is very tight and, therefore, no export licences are granted as a rule. • • • •page 2 PABT 'B” 5* Exports of food items are severely restricted. Commercial exports of grains, pul/rfses and flour, vegetable product, fodder, bran and pollard, sugar including molasses are prohibited. Cattle and poultry are also prohibited for export but a very small quota has been set apart for goat and sheep to Ceylon which depends on India entirely for her supplies. Small quotas have also been set apart for onions, garlic, fresh vegetables and fresh and dry fruits to the neighbouring countries but export of other kinds of fruits and vegetables is not allowed. Factories are permitted to export fruit products up to 10 % of their production; other miscellaneous items of provisions and oilman stores are allowed to go up to the 1941-42 level except pickles, chutneys and vinegar which are permitted to go freely. Dry fish is permitted to go in limited quantities from the various ports. All spices except pepper and chillies have been de-controlled but chillies are permitted to go In restricted quantities. Export of pepper is centrally controlled by the Food Department and it is regulated by a special procedure, line position detailed sbove is not static but is constantly changing. t'AEl' “C' C. Articles wjrich are important from the point cf view of Government supplies ere grouped in this part and most of the items included therein are such in which there was no appreciable export trade in the past and therefore, applications for the export of limited quantities ere considered by the Directorate General of Industries and bupplies on merits. Intending applicants would be well advised to state whether they are past exporters or ir^a nufecturers of the commodity aFplleS for of have'fulfilled an y contracts with inat Department during the pe r iod of ffar . i m i oi 7. From the point of view of India's export trade the commodi ties mentioned in this part are most important. Items in other parts arc constantly reviewed and transferred to this part as and when supply conditions permit, The necessity of meeting the essen tial minimum requirements of countries dependant on India fer their supplies, as also the need fox developing new or maintaining old export markets are the main factors governing the regulations of trade in commodities included In this part. Tliese can be grouped under the following categories t - 8. Commodities for which applicants are allotted export quotas with reference to their previous exports during a particular basic period are called ^uota Items. They are such as apparels, Glue- stock, hides and sxlns, Paints, Oilseeds, oils, footwear, cotton, waxes, textiles, soap, etc. The quota period is generally 3 years ending March 1939/1941 in the case of exports to 2urope/Far East anu 1941-42 in the case of other destinations. Intending exporters should, tnerefore, apply to the Export Trade Controllers at the port of export for export licences for these comodities only if they have exports to their credit during the appropriate basic period supported by full documentary evidence. 9. Commodities for which applications are considered on individual merits without insistence on exports during any basic period usually comprise articles the production of which has been developed during the war period and which ere either surplus to internal requirements or fer which export markets should be found to develop the nascent industries. Chemicals and Chemical pre parations, drugs and medicines, instruments, apparatus and applian ces, lamps, matches, are instances of the kind. In respect of such commodities ••••4. . . .. page 3* II I 111 commodities applications should be submitted to the Export Trade Controllers stating the extent of production in the past year, the quantity consumed internally, previous exports (if any), and the extent to which demands for their products exist in overseas markets. 10* Commodities, the supply position of which is found to be so tight as to warrant a total prohibition on exports for the time being, are reviewed periodically and restrictions re-imposed or relaxed wherever possible. /large 11. With a view to stimulating export trade, a^number of commodities are being de-controlled periodically. Lists of commo dities thus de-controlled are published in the Indian Trade Journal. The last list was published in the Indian Trade Journal of the 20th June, 1946. A Supplementary List is enclosed.

EXPORT TRADE CONTROL A BRIEF INTRODUC TION. {Received from the Chief Contt otter of Export*, New iJelhi.) Enquiries are often received from Chambers, Associations, firms and individual exporters asking for detailed information about the regulations relating to export control, ft has not been found possible within the short space of a letter to furnish detailed information on the subject. For full information reference should he made to the local Export Trade Controller or to the Manual on Export Trade Control. Copies of the Manual can be had from the Manager of Publications, Civil Lines, Delhi. The following note is only a brief introduction to the subject, but no part of it should be considered as authoritative interpre tation of any regulations, 2. A list of articles subject to control is given in the schedule to the Commerce Department Notification No. 91-CW(l)/45, of 3rd November 1945. A revised copy of this Notification was published on 27th April 1940*. Copies of this Notification ami subsequent amendments can be purchased from the local Export Trade Controller or the Manager of Publications. Civil Lines, Delhi. // i* important to note that commodities not scheduled therein do not require any export licence and can he shipped without reference to the export control authorities. 3. The Notification, it will be observed, is divided into four parts and the authorities to whom applications for export should bo made are indicated in the superscript of each part. The follow ing comments may be of use to the public :— * Part “ A ”, ^ 4. This includes articles the supply position of which is verv tight and. therefore, no export licences are granted as a rule. Part “ B ”, ij 5. Exports of food items are severely restricted. Commercial ft exports of grains, pulses and flour, vegetable product, fodder. [/ bran and pollard, sugar including molasses are prohibited. Cattle and poultry are also prohibited for export but a very small quota has been set apart for goat and sheep to Ceylon which defends on India entirely for her supplies. Small quotas have also been set apart for onions, garlic, fresh vegetables and fresh and drv fruits to the neighbouring countries but export of other kinds of fruits and vegetables is not allowed. Factories are permitted to export fruit products up to 10 per cent of their production ; other miscellaneous items of provisions and oilman stores are allowed to go up to the 1941-42 level'except pickles, chutneys.and vinegar which are permitted to go freely. Dry fish is permitted to go in limited quantities from the various polls. All spites, except pepper and chillies, have been decontrolled but chillies are permitted to go in restricted quantities. Export of pepper is centrally controlled 'hv the Food Department and it is regulated by a special procedure- file position detailed above is not static but is constantly changing ' Part “ C ”. 6. Articles which are important from the point of view of Government supplies are grouped in this part and most, of the * ,S'«&gt; the Indian Trade Journal, dated the 27tli June li1 4 &lt;1 , pa^en 143 . 4 $ items included therein are such in which there was no appreciable export trade in the past and. therefore, applications for the export of limited quantities are considered by the Directorate, Genera) of Industries and (Sup^ies on merits. Intending applicants would In well advised to state whether they are past exporters or wannfac- fu/ers of the commodity applied for or have fulfilled any contracts with that Department during the period of War. Part “ D ”. * i&gt; From the point of view of India's cx|jort trade' the commo dities mentioned in this part are most important. Items in other |)aits are constantly reviewed and transferred to this part as and when supply conditions permit. The necessitv of meeting the essential minimum requirements of countries dependent on India foi their supplies, as also the need for developing new or main taining old export markets are the main factors governing the regulations of trade in commodities included in this part. These can lie grouped under the following categories :— 8. Commodities for which applicants are allotted export quotas with reference to their previous exports during a particular basic period are called Quota items. They are, such as, apparels, glue- * stock, hides and skins, paints, oilseeds, oils, footwear, cotton, waxes, textiles, soap, etc. The quota period is generally 3 years ending March 1939/41 in the case of exports to Europe/Far East and 1941-42 in the case of other destinations. Intending exporters should, therefore, apply to the Export Trade (Controllers at the port of export for export licences for these commodities, onlv if they have exports to their credit during the appropriate basic period supported by full documentary evidence. 9. Commodities for which applications are considered on in dividual merits without insistence on exports during anv basic period usually comprise articles the production of which has been developed during the war period and which are either surplus to internal requirements or for which ex|&gt;nrt markets should be found to develop the nascent industries. Chemicals and chemical preparations, drugs and medicines, instruments, apparatus and appliances, lamps, matches, are instances of the kind, fn respect of such commodities applications should be submitted to the Export Trade Controllers stating the extent of production in the past year, the quantity consumed internally, previous exports if any), and the extent to which demands for their products exist in overseas markets. 10. Commodities, the supply position of which Is found to be so tight as to warrant a total prohibition on exports for the time being, are reviewed periodically and restrictions reimposed or relaxed, wherever possible. -'ll. With a.view to stimulating export trade, a large number of commodities are being decontrolled periodically. Lists of commodities thus decontrolled are published in the Indian Trade Journal. The last list was published in the Indian Trade Journal2 of the 20th .Tunr 1040. A Supplementary list is piven below. The list is neither exhaustive nor anything contained in it should be construed t* override, the provision of the Export Control Notification No. 91-C.W.(l)/45, dated the 4rd November 1945, as amended from time to time.
