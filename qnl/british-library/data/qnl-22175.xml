Arabian Mission to write to the Political Agent asking if there was &gt;any objection to their goiag to Qatar or elsewhere and the Politics 1 A. cut used to reply that there v.as no objection, ot was, as the case might be (in practice no objection was, as far as I know, ever raised). £.

The doctors of the Arabian Mission, usually being Americans, would have to pay &amp;•£?/- for a visa. If this fee were to be levied it would be difficult to refuse to make th~ visa v?. lid for any number of journeys within one year, but I should much prefer th: t the doctors of the Arabian Mission In the past it was customary for the doctors of the should ask2 should ask me on each occasion and should not have a lenex’al visa for one year vfoich v/ould enable tneni to wander about mox*e or less at their own free will* On the other hand it would hardly be reasonable to charge 13.27/- each time for a single journey, 5. It might be possible to give them the visa for any number of journeys in one year on the distinct understanding that they isrote in and ashed on each occasion of proceeding to a Trucial Coast place or to Qatar, but this might lead to difficulties. It is easier to refuse a visa than to cancel one already given, 6. On the other hand it is difficult to insist on imposing these hi ;h visa fees (even though punitive N . The doctors receive requests from the local Rulers to go to see their families and if they were to complain to the Rulers of the high rates of the visa fees, it might place us in rather an embarrassing position as we issue the visas as the representatives of those Rulers, 7, In all the circumstances I would suggest that in the case of the medic:, 1 (but not the evangelical) personnel of the Arabian Mission proceeding to &lt;*atar or the Trucial Coast at the written reruest to the Political Agent of the Ruler, a visa should be insisted upon, but that it should be given gratis as for professional services rendered, 8, The question has arisen over an urgent request by Shaikh 1 Abdullah bin Jasim ui Tiiani of Qatar to Doctor Thoms of the Arabian mission (Shaikh Abdullah wrote to me also) to go to ^oha to vaccinate his family.

MEMORANDUM. /T 7 Subject:- Visas for Doctors of the Arabian Mission. Reference your letter Ro. C/479-IA/7 of the 14th NoTember, 1936. With regard to your various suggestions, hven if no visa fees are charged and such visas are issued for one journey only, this would only ensure that the doctors had to approach you for a visa each time they wished to visit the Trucial Coast: it would not put you in a position to refuse these visas since they would be applied for on humanitarian grounds. 2 . i think therefore that visas will have to be issued good for any number of journeys for one year with the usual charge - if the applicant is an American - of Rupees 27. I concur that you could not in practice charge this high fee and make the visa valid for one journey only. 3 # x think however that we can insist that before a doctor of the Mission visits any Trucial Coast Sheikhdom he should have a letter from the Ruler of that Sheikhdom to make that particular visit: this will at any fciMt rate tend to stop any thing in the nature of a roving commission 4 0 yife can base this proviso on the fact that we / «- » n v /2 - we are responsible through, the Sheikh for the safety of travellers on the Trucial Coast, whether doctors or others, and therefore cannot let doctors visit any Sheikhdom unless its Ruler, by issue of the letter mentioned above, has made himself responsible for his visitor 1 s safety* 5 # With regard to the evangelical personnel of the Mission (vide your paragraph 7) we can I think, if the occasion arises, definitely refuse any such application on the grounds that evangelical work will not be welcomed by the Sheikhs, and no humanitarian considerations are involved.

In Tiberias Dr. Sacki and his wife became Christians and he was compelled to leave the Jewish Hospital, since when he and his wife have been living in the Scottish Mission there. He is now said to be seeking a Palestinian passport. 3.

My dear Doctor, Your letter of 13th October has been be fore^me for some time, but having nothing to suggest i was waiting to see what turned up. It now happens that there is an Austrian doctor, a Christian, who is anxious to do mission work, and seems of the right type and outlook. I am sending you a copy herewith of his' qualifications. You will see from thau that he is no ordinary d.octor, but what we would ca— m this country a specialist. He says he is not primarily concerned about ioney as his own needs are simple and he is not marriea. 'he only responsibility he has is that his father ana iother will be refugees in England, and he will have oo send money to support them. As soon as he heard about this opportunity for service he showed great keenness that something should ^ome of it. He is prepared to come at^once. Tne dix-i- •'ultv is that he has a German qualification, and i am vondering whether that will be any drawback to working ,vith you'in Bahrain. I do not know what the^rule is there, but in India an English qualification is required, ana in Africa only if one is engaging in private remunerative prac tice 1 think if he is coming into the service oj. an ac-^ credited mission such as yours, and you obtained the sanction of the Resident in Bahrain, there should be no difficulty.

Cppikofer, I resident of the Ear, Hose and Throat Hospital, University Clinic of the Municipal Hospital. To the pass ort Department of the British Consulate. Sir, In confirmation of our telephone conversation of today, I have pleasure in committinr my remarks concerning Dr Friedrich SCHITXMANH, aged B9, to paper. 1 . His character. Dr SCHTJHMAKIT, of German birth, brought up in the Protestant faith, has been since 2.1.36, Assistant doctor in the Ear, Hose and Throat Department of the Municipal Hospital, Basel (Buergerspital, Basel). I value him as a clever, diligent and reliable doctor; he is well thought of also by his fellow Assistants, at whose disposal he has invariably placed himself readily and cheerfully. 2 . His Medical Qualifications . He is the Senior Assistant doctor of the hospital and has done four years specializing, in fact he was ready to set up as a specialist. Since the mobilisation of Dr Labhardt, the second doctor in command of this hoepitel, Dr Schurmann has been able to relieve me of difficult cases and to take ever responsibilities from me. Our Clinic is at present very much dependent on his services as out of a total of five Assistants, almost one half are absent owing to Military Service, see no reason to expect any improvement in this situation in the next few months and therefore on 2”.12.39 I wrote to the Directorate of the Municipal Hospital asking them to make a specific request to the Police for the extension of Dr. Schurmann's permis de sejour here; this was done on 31.12.39, and I have not as yet receiv ed any answer from the Police Department. (Aliens Department). 3 . His political or ientation. Dr SCIFJKMANF, as I and his fellow Assistants know for certain, loathes the present German regime and has no intention of back to Germany. He was therefore grateful when the post of Assistant doctor in Bahrein was offered uo him in September 1939. fd/ Irof. E.

CONFID'EN'llAL BAHRAIN PERSIAN GULF. DO/CA. 5/3662 11th March, 1944 \ My dear Major Hickinbotham, You may have heard that Dr. Chandy, the Indian doctor at the American Mission hospital, is leaving shortly for special train ing in America. He has been associated with the treatment of our Indian and local staff for some years and has consistently gone to endless trouble in looking after them. I thought it would be appropriate if the Company gave him a present and approached Dr. Harrison with the idea. Dr. Harrison put up the view that any money ^e proposed to send might with advantage form the basis of a fund which would help to meet his expenses while under training, he suggested that Hamah bin Daghir should approach some of the people who have benefited from his treatment. The response has been much greater than was anticipated and has reached Rs.3000/- odd. A proper list is being kept and the money will be handed over to Dr. harrison for presentation to Dr. Chandy. It struck me that you might be interested in the scheme now that it has reached such unexpected proportions. I presume that there is nothing irregular in it and we can proceed to hand over the money to Dr. Harrison. If you would like to see the list we will send it along. Yours sincerely, Major T.

I note what you have written concerning bringing out other missionar ies from U•3•A• to help me. I can understand your viewpoint of decaying my plan of ouiluirg, a meoical mission until af.uer this war. t assure you their salaries will be guaranteed by our Board from America. However, please allow me to ask you all to reconsider your decision concerning the nurse Miss Bdna Barter. She has had for nearly three years a f, no objection' certificate to come to Sahara. But since no passport was granted uo her or any other lady from U. 3 .&amp;. to leate the country she has been delayed from coming, rsut just now Cur Government has because she is a nurse, granted her a ‘special concession to journey over here. I should mention that her permit to enter here, was 0 iven me by H.H* the sultan of Muscat in 1941. I ask you all if you will please reconsider^your decision for two chief reasons, e’irot. She is now aoout tnirty two years and you know it is high 'time she o 6 - 3 nere to study this language for at least two years be tore she can under taKe Mission work. &lt;ve all know from experience the Arabic is not an easy language and the younger a person is the easier it is tor tnem to acAnire it* ^ Secondly, my Board has been very deeply concerned about my livin 0 here alone. I am no longer young and if any sickness attacks me I have no one near to help me. So 1 plead with you to allow just one more person to come with me to Kaiba. I have sent word uO the regent of Kalba when his messenger arrived here in a lorry April 2nd or tnird with the news that I was permitted to live there, I could not now come until after I returned from India the First of Octooer. I shill appreciate a reoly from you as early as possiole so I can send the word to Miss Barker before she leaves U.3.A. I think the safest way to send your letter will be to Karachi as I pian uo leave here the first of June. I shall enclose the address in Karachi.

S.No:19. setter NosC/lOS of 11th February 1935 to Dr. Dame. ?*. k- rc ?■*- H- ’ ^ -A. Dr. Dame and Dr. Storm came to see nie this morning. About a year ago Dr ^ame said he had promised the Shaikh of Shariah that he would spend two or three weeks in Sharjah doing medical work. Three weeks ago when Dr. Dame thought that his visit to Riyadh would be delayed he wrote to the Shaikh of Sharjah and asked him if it would be convenient if he went to Sharjah this month. Two days ago (11/2/1935) Dr Dame received a letter from the Shaikh of Sharjah to the effect that the Shaikh would be glad to see him at any time. No letter was written to us and I gather that the letter written to the Shaikh Dp. Dame was somewhat vague*and Dp. Dame wanted to know if Dr. Storm could go to Sharjah by the boat of the 17th February. I asked him to wait until you returned and to see you then ; and he said, rather naivel}^ that he was sure it would be better for both you and Dr. Storm if your visits did not coincide. He then tried to find out where you were on this present tourOn the 17th February 1935 Dr. Dame and Dr. Storm came to see me. After some discussion of Dr. Dame*s forth coming trip to Sa’udi Arabia he broached the real object of their visit. 2. Dr Dame said that a number of people from Sharjah had come through on the Hajj (though this was rather vague). It seems that he wrote to Shaikh Sultan and received a reply the exact nature of which Dr. Dame did not state, but the result was that they wished to send Dr.Storm to Sharjah. If he can be spared he would like to go down there shout in about a fortnights time and to stay for about two or three weeks. 3. I said that I would like to consult the Resident about this but that my personal attitude was that^naturally medical vrork fell in a different category to ordinary visits to the Crucial Coast r in view of the Air Station and the general development along the Trucial Coast we had had to tighten up the giving of visas. I said, here again speaking personally, that I should want to get Shaikh Sultan to put the matter to me in writing so that I could call him to account in the event of anything happening. I said that, of course, in these days the likelihood of anything happening was not the same as in the past but that at the same time I should want to put the responsibility definitely on the Shaikh. I said that the Political Resident would be coming back on about the 20th February and that I would speak to him then. 4. I said to Dr. Storm that I hoped that if he was given a visa for Sharjah that it would not mean his going off into the interior like in Dhufar, at which they both smiled, and Dr Storm assured me that he would not go into the interior but would remain in Sharjah (of course, the first visit would only be the thin end of the wedge!).yu. 5 (I A l &lt; 5. I thought that the conversation gave me an opening and I said that I hoped that if he was given a visa for Sharjah that he would be most careful to keep out of anything political. I instanced what 1 meant ^ a to Dr Dame that when he and D r Thoms had been down to ^atar he had been represented to me/as 33 'Oil Agent'. I said that knew him well enough^but that it was not so much what was actually said or done as what people represented any European or American as doing. Dr Dame told me that he was careful not to mix himself up in anything and said that people ask questions and one could not avoid answering questions about oil in Bahrain and so on. I also mentioned the case of the sons of ’Obaid and he said that he had not ,told them that he would tell the Political Agent about their / case, but had been quite non-committal. He had on the other / hand told the Syrian doctor that he would tell the Political Agent about him. 6. I also took the opportunity of saying that for some time we had had the intention of arranging for a doctor to work on the Trucial Coast but that unfortunately the financial depression had made it impossible to do so. I said that there seemed to be some hope of the position improving and I added that at any rate the 5% cut was to be withdrawn. I said that I did not know whether it would be possible to do anything of this kind but that I had made a start by taking Dp. Holmes with me and hoped to do something of the same sort with a similar Medical Officer from Bushire. Dr Dame asked me where he would be likely to have his head quarters and 1 said that probably at Sharjah as the Air Station was there. He asked me whether he would do quarantine w%k and I said that was looking too far ahead. I said that I had no idea that Government would give money for such an object but that I had always felt (and I knew Prior also feltthe same) that the ^racial Coast was badly of/In the matter of medical work: I said that I hoped that there would be no overlapping in our medical work if they were to go down and that we should have to take counsel together in the matter. ^r Dame said that he was sure there would be no need for overlapping and asked whether our man would be a surgeon. I replied that his qualifications would depend on how much money I could wring out of Government for this object. ?• I think on the whole that the conversation has done good and may enable us to work ourselves into a position of controlling to some extent the activities of the Mission in that area, though it is probably impossible to keep them out of it. 17-2-1935.
