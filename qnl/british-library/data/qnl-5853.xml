P n Kuwait-Saudi Blockade Conference rt My dear FowXe, On the principle of keeping you au fait of all that has been happening here where the conference is concerned, I write to say that this morning (6.7.35) Abdulla al Onsaibl, returned by air to Bahrain and Shaikh Klalid ibn al Walid and Shaikh Hamad al Sulaiman, called on me preparatory to leaving for Riyath tonight by oar. 2. Both Khalid and Hamad al Sulaiman took pains to tell me that they hoped X would bear witness to the pleasant spirit in which the recent Conference was held; They stated that it was with real regret that they were returning to Nejd without having affected a settlement and trusted the conversations that had been held woula oe the beginning of later ones to come - To use my simile they said the door had been opened slightly, and some day En Sha Allah it would he opened wide - Lastly,that while A* in Kuwait they bad seen and heard a very great deal whidh^ made them deeply sympathetic towards Kuwait (They referre to the IBA^ Government’s smuggling accusations). 3. Then while Shaikh Khalid al Walid was conversir with Mrs. Dickson, Shaikh Bemad bin Sulaiman confided to in an The Hon’ble Lieut-Colonel T.C.W.Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf2- in an undertone that what had really made the King so 'sticlp^g' about the 'Guarantee' business was the fact that he saw with great indignation that the IRAq Govern ment was making no effort at all to guard the IRAQ-Kuwait frontier, and that such hopeless state of affairs made it impossible for him (the King) to come to terms with Kuwait, 'If you Colonel Dickson', he said 'could only get the IRM Government to patrol their borders properly, as Saudi Arabia was doing, opd.y then you would see a change in the demeanour of Bin Saud, he would talk business! 4. Shaikh Hamad added that the King’s sympathies were all with Kuwait in the smuggling trouble with IRAQ., and that he resented fiercely the attempts that were being made by IRA£ to try and force Kuwait to do her dirty work for her.

Note regrets that incident of little iraportance should be given undue significance, and magnified hastily, in the way which Kuwait reported it. It reiterates that no hostile act by armed forces was committed, asserting that incident was ordinary and did not merit protests It recapitulates in substantially same terms earlier explanation of movemaats of the four men, and after alleging that retainers were not treated with courtesy customary between two countries and ruling families, it goes on to state that this is not the first instance where precipitancy has led to erroneous information dwA emating from Kuwait,and quotes an incident k concerning a claim by Kuwait against certain AWAZIM tribesmen in December 1929, liquidated bv IBN SAUDe 1 /22/ by Ibn Saud punishing the tribe as sheep raiders (Political Resident’s telegram No, 1302 December 29th 1929 &lt; and related correspondence appears to refer to this). Legation note 92 appears to indicate that H.M.G. consider Ibn Saud was attempting to exercise authority in Kuwait. Saudi Government deny that there is warrant for this, and add that should H.M.G. and Shaikh maintain that view they would be compelled adhere position regarding movement into respective territories indicated briefly in Jedda telegram No. 121, unless some mutually agreed modus vivendi to eliminate misunderstanding can be devised. The Note asserts that Saudi Government desires to promote friendly relations with H.M.G. and Shaikh, and (apparently disregarding last para Legation Note of June 9th) hopes to learn their views, as to whether present frontier practice should continue or new arrangement^ be sought. Meanwhile Saudi Government request that Kuwait will prevent its subjects and officials from entering Saudi Arabia without previous permission, they for their part undertaking to observe like attitude. &amp; 2 2/British Legation* No.1750/226/103* ( 3 &gt; Jedvi.a* 23rd, July 1935.

His Majesty^s Government are gi^Ld to infer that the messengers in question did not belong to the King’s organised forces but were merely retainers of His Excellency whe Governor oi Hasa. It is nevertheless clear that they belonged to a party sent by tnie Governor in the first instance to chllect ciik&amp;t. If they entered, the Shaikh’s territory simply intending to go to Kuwait for the purpose of sanding messages to Haoa, as indicated by 'four Royal highness, they exposed themselves in the opinion of ny government, to grave misunderstanding by staying two days at Sucaxhiya and by diverging from the usual route to visit Jehra, it could only be inferred from these facts and irun tne language held by them to the tribes that their mission was to put pressure cn them while still in Kuwait. His Britannic Majesty's Government hope that steps will be taken to prevent recurrence of such action which s Royal Highness presents The Minister for Foreign Affairs.presents at least the appearance of an attempt to exercise authority in the Eing*s name outside his territory. At for the rest neither His Majesty*e Government nor the Shaikh wish to interfere with any existing practice as regards the crossing of the frontier for legitimate purposes. On the contx*ary they warmly welcome the assurance of the Saudi Arab Government *s strong desire to promote the restoration of economic relations which have long been interrupted. It was because they shared this desire that they did not on their aide in any way conn*ect the incident of May 6th //ith arrangements for the proposed conference between the Governments of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. .Vith highest respects* A.C.

THE SHEIKH said that in 1929 he had received a letter from H.M.G. concerning his trade with hejd, Aziz. His Excellency had carried out his part and had even fought with A1 huwish’s people, 'but H.M.G. , for their part, had as yet failed to make any progress towards a solution of the blockade. A Saudi deputation of 83 persons had recently visited Koweit, but His excellency thought that no good had come of the conference which had taken place. HR.LAITHWAITE said that for some time H.M.G. had been trying hard to reach a solution of the Dlocxade question with King Abdul Aziz, and that, as tne Sheikh would remember the proposal for a conference regarding iu, which had now materialised, had originated with the late Sir Hugh Biscoe. He reminded the Sheikh that matters had been held up for more than a year owing to a misunderstanding about certain correspondence between His Excellency and the King of Saudi Arabia. After briefly recalling the proceedings at the recent Conference at Koweit, he said that H.M.G. regarded it as satisfactory that the Saudi delegation had gone so far as agreeing even on the principle of a system of manifests and Customs posts. H.M.G. entirely agreed that the Saudi demand for a guarantee as a condition of agreement on this basis, that not a single Koweit smuggler would cross the frontier was quite unreasonable. The India Office and promising t. that if His Excellency would prevent help being given to Eaisal al Duwish, H.M.G. would endeavour to reach a solution of his trade difficulties with King Abdul Foreign/10 . Foreign Office had already made strong representations to Fuad Bey Hamza regarding this guarantee in which they had emphasised that Koweit was however prepared to give an honourable undertaking to do all in its power to suppress smuggling. They would continue to do their utmost for Koweit in the matter. MR. REFTDBI said that only that morning he had again spoken to Fuad Bey Hamza and that Fuad Bey had telegraphed on the subject to King Abdul Aziz.

Ministry of Foreign Affairs, T&amp;if. 1.0th 'tahi ath- r -ianl 1354. 11th July 1935. fhe Honourable Charge &amp;*Affaires, I have received your note ifo.92 {1366/226^3) dated 9th June, 1935, explaining the views of the British Government in respect of my note to Sir Andrew Ryan Ifo.9/i/4 dated 26th Safar 1354 ( 29th May), and regret that such a small unimportant case should assume such important proportions in the exchange of these communications and correspondence. I'his is due only to the haste of the authorities at Kuwait in describing this incident in a form other than its real one, so much so that Sir Andrew Ryan in the course of his conversation with Bheylch Yusuf Yasin used the words w the occurence of an assault on Kuwait by armed forces**, while it finally appeared that there was neither attack nor hostile act, but that the indident was an ordinary and trivial one not meriting a protest. The case was that four persona of the servants of the Amir of rasa entered Kuwait territory where they passed on their way by Jubaihiya and Jahra not in order to enforce foreign authority in Kuwait territory, but to telegraph to their Amir in respect of the bednin, and perhaps they might have informed the beduin themesIves In a special manner that certain well© had been left for them in the territory of H.M. King Abdul Asia, and it was possible H.B.M«Charge &amp; f Affaire s, /for J edda.for them to have access to them whenever they wished to go t’nere to pay Zakat. These efforts were made by the messengers themselves by way of personal information and not otherwise» and, had there been any intention to exercise jj the influence of the Saudi Arab Government, they (heduin) would have been asked to pay hakat while they were in their (tribal) territory, and not by ©ending only four persons to them. The British Government will therefore gather from this, that the incident was described in a form other than its true one, and that the treatment extended to the said messengers had nothing of the usual courtesy between the two countries and the two ruling families. Moreover this i® not the first time that haste ha® occurred in the iransmissioz of new© from Kuwait inaccurately, and if the British Government refer to (the incidents of) Ha^ab, 1346 (December 19119) they will find that the Government of Kuwait once pretended that a party of al Awazim had become their subjects. The British Government then wrote a note to our Government through the Consul at Jedda to the effect that the Aw&amp;aim had become subjects of the Amir of Kuwait, but after we informed them of the true facts, they investigated the same, and found, that there was no proof to show that the above mentioned (Awasim) had adopted the Kuwait nationality, and that this was obviously confirmed in the note of the Assistant Political Agent in the Persian Gulf at Kuwait to K.«. the King dated 2nd hha’aban 1346 (2nd January 1930), and it then appeared that the wasira entered Kuwait merely to rob a number of sheep there. B.M* the King was therefore compelled to punish them, and to recover the sheep which they had stolen, and to return them to the Sheykh of Kuwait. Prom this and previous instances the British Government /will ..21 /&lt;5) will gather that haste in communicating incidents in a form other than their real one always gives rise to the occurrence of misunderstanding and the disturbance of friendship from time to time* It appears from the terms of certain paragraphs of your note under reference that the British Government still consider that this incident was an attempt to exercise authority in the name of H.M. the King in other than his territory while our Government do not share this viewt ®nd that it has not been proved to them that any act took place which could he interpreted as the exercise of the authority of our Government in Kuwait territory, but if the British Government* and the Government of the 8. eykh of Kuwait insist that this incident be held to be a sort of interference in the authority of the other Government» our Government will therefore find themselves compelled to adhere to their position which 1 have already indicated in my note No* 9/i/4 dated. 26th Safer 1354 (29th Fay 1.935), namely to prevent their officials and subjects frov entering Kuwait | territory either amed or not, except upon permission being obtained from the Kuwait Government, and also to request that subjects and officials of the Kuwait Gove mm nt should refrain from entering the territory of the Saudi Arab Kingdom without permission, whether carrying arms or other wise, until a definite procedure 1© devised which we all shall adopt, and which will not give rise to mi sun&amp;erst&amp;ndiiu* to which Colonel Dickson alluded in Ms letter Ho* /15Q dated 15th Safar 1354 (iBth May 1935) addressed to Abdullah al Hafisi» KM. * s agent at Kuwait, and wMeh shall not causa any displeasure or complaint such a© that which Sir Andrew Ryan indicated in his conversation with Yusuf Yasin on the i5th Fay 1938, and confirmed in hi a note Ho* 75 (l2? 2/B/22/H ) dated 19th May 1935* During the (^present) time, my Government look forward to carrying out on their /side7^ side the greatest part in the endeavours to confim the * friendly and economic relations with the British Government and with that of Kuwait, they expect to learn the views of the two Governments in respect of the method to be followed with regard to movement between the two countries, as to whether the previous (system) should be followed as before, or whether they desire to conclude a new agreement in this respect* fending the conclusion of a clear and explicit agreement, my Government request that the prevention of any subjects and officials of Kuwait from entering the territories of his Majesty, before obtaining permission, should be observed* The same (attitude) will be followed by our Government until an explicit agreement is concluded on the subject between the two parties. itli highest respects, (S f d) Feysal.CONFIDENTIAL.

I July 5, 1935. Section 1. [E 4218/318/25] Record of the Fourth Meeting with Fuad_ Bey Hamza at the Foreign Office on July 5, 1935. THE following were present:— Mr. Rendel. Sir A. Ryan. Mr. Laithwaite, India Office. Mr. Ward. Mr. Malcolm. Fuad Bey Hamza. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba. I. The first subject to be discussed was the question of the eastern and south eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. Mr. RENDEL said that no further progress appeared for the moment to be possible, and that it was now for each side to consider the arguments put forward by the other. His Majesty’s Government, for their part, would await the statement which Fuad Bey had promised at the last meeting regarding the dir as or tribal areas of the three and a half tribes claimed by King Abdul Aziz, with particular reference to the southern sector of the boundary proposed by His Majesty’s Government. Mr. Rendel said that it would be paiticularly useful it Euad Bey could accompany this statement with a map which could show roughly (in say, gradations of shading or colour) the areas claimed as exclusively, predominantly or only partially inhabited, or wandered over, by particular tribes. FUAD BEY HAMZA explained that he would have difficulty in meeting this latter request, but that he hoped shortly to have ready a list of over 150 names of wells, water-holes, &amp;c., showing to which tribes and sections or sub-sections of tribes they were regarded as belonging. Mr. RENDEL expressed the hope that the statement might be available as soon as possible; but he explained that it would, of course, have to be referred to the British authorities in the Gulf and at Aden, so that it might be some weeks before His Majesty’s Government could reply to it. II. Mr. RENDEL then said that he wished to speak to Fuad Bey about the Saudi blockade of Koweit, or rather, since Fuad Bey did not like that term, about the problem of the economic relations between Saudi Arabia and Koweit. He began by outlining to Fuad Bey the information contained in the latest telegrams from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf regarding the position reached in the local conference which had recently been taking place at Koweit between the delegates of the sheikh and those of King Abdul Aziz. It appeared from these telegrams that, while the King was ready to adopt the Sheikh of Koweit s suggestion of a customs and manifest system, he had instructed the Saudi delegates to insist as a condition that the Sheikh of Koweit should give a guarantee that no single smuggler from Koweit would be allowed to cross the border. In the event of this guarantee failing on more than three occasions to prove effective, the Saudi Government would terminate any agreement reached. This guarantee the Koweit delegates had naturally been unable to give. They had, however, promised to give instead an undertaking on Koweit’s honour that Koweit would do her best to stop smuggling. At this stage the Saudi delegates had explained that they had no authority to go beyond the King’s orders. They had consequently closed down the negotiations and returned to Nejd. [456 e—1] b /2 Mr. Rendel pointed out that there was no legal obhgation on a country having low tariffs to prevent smuggling into a country whose tariffs weie g . The problem was one of frequent occurrence and, to take an example on a very much larger scale, had occurred between His Majesty s ^°\ e / n .^ n States Government in the days of prohibition m the United States. On that occasion His Majesty’s Government, though under no legal obligation to prevent the export of liquor to the United States, had, m the interests of good relations, voluntarily agreed to come to an arrangement under which they co-operated to check liquor smuggling. In a small way the position was analogous m Koweit, where the sheikh had now offered to co-operate for the purpose of checking smuggling into Saudi Arabia. But it was quite impossible for any countiy, e\en the most highly organised, to guarantee not to allow a single smuggler through, The Saudi Government’s demand could therefore only be described as unreasonable. Mr. Rendel regretted that the conference should have broken down in this unsatisfactory manner when agreement appeared to have been leached on the main problem. He wished to repeat that this question of Koweiti-Saudi relations was one to which His Majesty s Government attached particular importance. It was one of the main objects of His Majesty’s Government to ensure that Saudi relations with Koweit should now be regularised and set right on the same lines as had been so successfully followed in the case of Saudi relations first with Iraq and then with Transjordan. He hoped, therefore, that Fuad Bey might be able to arrange for the conference to be resumed. Mr. LAITHWAITE also stressed the desire of the Secretary of State for India and the Government of India to see this result achieved and the great importance which they attached to the disposal of the question. As regards the Saudi Government’s insistence on a guarantee, Mr. Laithwaite said that it seemed 1 clear from the history of the last few years that the Saudi Government were in a position to impose an effective blockade on the land frontier of Koweit and to deal with any persons who might be caught smuggling across that land frontier. That being so, a demand on Koweit for a guarantee such as had been suggested would seem, to say the least of it, superfluous. He drew Fuad Bey’s attention to the fact that if the Saudi Government’s demands were to be made public they could not fail to show King Abdul Aziz in an invidious light, and indeed might well give the impression that he was not really seeking a settlement. Mr. Laithwaite added that the Saudi delegates’ difficulties in negotiating, even with the help of the telegraph, were of course understood by 'His Majesty’s Government, but he reminded Fuad Bey that Koweit was ready to promise on her honour to do her best to stop the^ smuggling, and he made it clear that His Majesty’s Government for their part would do all in their power to ensure that this undertaking was observed. He trusted therefore that Fuad Bey would be able to suggest some way in which the Saudi Government could be induced to relax their insistence on an absolute guarantee. FUAD BEY HAMZA, in reply, explained that, while the Saudi Legation had received some information as to the progress of the negotiations at Koweit, they were not yet in possession of full details as to the points on which those negotiations had broken down. The information now given to him helped to make the position clearer. Lie now understood that the following proposals had (a) A system of customs posts through which trade would be canalised. (b) A system of manifests to be operated in conjunction with the system of customs posts. u) An honourable undertaking by Koweit to do all she could to prevent smuggling across the Saudi border. This having been confirmed, Fuad Bey undertook to make enquiries by tele graph of his Government and expressed the hope that he would shortly be in a position to make some statement on the matter. J At this point Mr. Laithwaite withdrew. III. The meeting then proceeded to discuss the future of the Treaty of Jedda aband0 “ * Hls Ma ^’ s3 L- 3 %k : ^ the «■ Onj on to pi oodreati ^-operate as in | 0I ! cii|| countn f describe! broken •• ^ reachei boweiti-l ^d partic rovernmei and sett; audi relat hat Fuad' J of State md the p i-S regard; that it * ernment ? er of fo w Fuadl re tohei ons ligltj r a settk otiatinga lis Majee ly to pi i it cleat: wer to ei ad Bey i be into indi Legi ns at Ko? i which:: tim helptl proposals: tanalisei h the sj* Id to pK' dries by : iortl) rl)ei jtyf 1 ? ;is Maf Mr. REND EL said that he wished first of all to dispose of a misunder- standing to which Fuad Bey had given expression in conversation with Sir L. Oliphant on the previous day. It appeared that Fuad Bey had gained the impression during the conversations which were held in London in September 1934, that His Majesty’s Government had declared their willingness to renew the Treaty of Jedda in the manner now proposed by the Saudi Government, but that Fuad Bey had now found, to his surprise and regret, that they had since changed their minds. Mr. Rendel said he was satisfied, and had confirmed from the records of the 1934 conversations, that Fnad Bey was under a misapprehension on this point. His Majesty’s Government had never taken any decision about the future of the Treaty of Jedda,and had not gone back on anything that had been said to Fuad Bey 'on that subject last year. He cited once more the three possibilities which had been discussed in 1934 and which had again been quoted by Sir A. Ryan at the meeting held on the 2nd July. Of these three, the negotiation of an entirely new treaty covering all points at issue and drawn up in &amp; accordance with present conditions naturally seemed the most workmanlike. This could, however, only take place when the major questions now outstanding had been settled, and as it now looked as though a settlement of these questions mi°’ht take longer than had at first been anticipated, the conclusion of such a new comprehensive treaty might in consequence be delayed foi a considerable time. This being so he could see no objection in principle to the prolongation of the present treaty in the way suggested by Fuad Bey Hamza, if agreement could be reached in regard to any modifications of the provisions oi the Jedda settlement which it was desired at the same time to introduce. Mr. Rendel reminded Fuad Bey that it had been agreed at a previous meeting that the principal topic to be discussed before the Jedda settlement could be prolonged and amended m this way was the question of slavery in relation to His Majesty’s right of manumission. He drew attention once more to the strength of public and parliamentary opinion in this country on the subject of slavery, and of the important influence ot the anti-slavery societies. It was therefore essential that His Majesty s Government should be able to justify any decision which they might reach to abandon their rio-ht of manumission, on the lines contemplated in the original exchange or notes, bv being able to show that a new situation now existed in Aiabia which rendered the maintenance of that right inappropriate or unnecesary. He added, speaking personally and unofficially, that the draft anti-slavery regulations which Fuad Bey had communicated privately to Sir A. Ryan seemed to him to provide a hopeful basis for further discussion. It had not yet, however, been possible to submit the details of these proposals to the Secretary of State and it would be necessary, before any undertaking could be given to the Saudi Government, to submit to Sir Samuel Hoare a detailed statement showing the precise scope of the proposed Saudi regulations. It was only thus that Ministers would be able to judge whether the new arrangements would be sufficient to enable them to make an adequate defence in Parliament for the abandonment by His Majesty s Government of this important and well-known right. _ Mr. Rendel suggested that it would be of great assistance from the point of view of further progress if Fuad Bey Hamza could give a firm undertaking that King Abdul Aziz would, when the time came, be ready to promulgate regulations on the lines o± tiose now under discussion. SIR ANDREW RYAN then explained the progress which he had been able to make on the previous day in a conversation with Fnad Bey Hamza (see separate record in E 4163/325/25) and gave it as his opinion, subject to one or two difficult points, that a promising position had now been reached as regards slavery. There were, however, other points which needed consideration m connexion with the future of the Treaty of Jedda, some of which had already been raised by the Saudi Government. He mentioned the question of the arms traffic as an example. He pointed out, however, that, if only m view of the close questioning which His Majesty’s Government must be prepared to race, ie problem of slavery was the most serious. FUAD BEY HxAMZA again pressed for an assurance that His Majesty’s Government would in principle be prepared to prolong the Treaty of Jedda. Mr. RENDEL replied that, while he was not yet authorised to give a formal assurance to this effect, he did not think that His Majesty s Government won [456 e—1] B 24 be likely to raise any objection in prinapb Jedda amount to a declaration that neith P y sa - (1 be f ore; agreement could be reache^on any Sificatira in the provisions of the settlement which the Saudi Government wished to take this opportunity to secuie. The discussion then reverted to the question of slavery and manumission. FUAD BEY HAMZA explained that this question could only be pursued on a bast of complete confidence between the two parties He realised that His Maiesty’s Government would require to have advance knowledge of the anti- slavery legislation which the Saudi Government intended to promulgate. He doubted however, whether the Saudi Government wou d be wil mg to communi cate the exact terms of the proposed legislation to His Mamsty s Government. He suggested that His Majesty s Government should be content with am understanding as to what should be covered by the legislation and leave the actual drafting to the Saudi Government. Fuad Bey again emphasised the impoitanee of avoiding any impression that internal Saudi legislation was being carried out at the dictation of His Majesty’s Government. Mr. RENDEL explained that His Majesty’s Government fully realised the importance of avoiding this impression. On the other hand, they must be in a position adequately to defend their abandonment of the right of manumission, and this could only be done if the legislation, in consideration of which the right of manumission would, in fact, be abandoned, could be regarded as satisfactory. They could not, therefore, give any undertaking about the eventual abandonment of their right without precise knowledge of the provisions of the contemplated legislation. It was, however, just as much in the interest of the Saudi Govern ment as of His Majesty’s Government that the legislation should be actually enacted before His Majesty’s Government abandoned their right of manumission, since if His Majesty’s Government could say that new legislation had been voluntarily enacted by King Abdul Aziz and that a new situation had thereby been produced, and actually existed, which justified them in abandoning their right of manumission, it would look far less as though a bargain had been struck than if the right of manumission were abandoned simultaneously with, or in advance of, the promulgation of the legislation in question. FUAD BEY HAMZA explained that the Saudi Government must have a private guarantee that if the legislation were passed His Majesty’s Government would then abandon their right of manumission. SIR A. RYAN restated the procedure, which he himself had had in mind and which, if adopted, would involve three stages, viz., (1) a private but binding agreement that, if the Saudi Government promulgated legislation on certain lines, His Majesty’s Government would renounce the right of manumission; (2) the promulgation of the Saudi legislation; and (3) the public renunciation of the right of manumission as part of the suggested arrangements for prolonging the validity of the Treaty of Jedda. Mr. RENDEL saw no difficulty in regard to the private guarantee suggested by Fuad Bey provided Flis Majesty’s Government were satisfied as to the nature of the legislation. Indeed, if they were not, the position would be impossible, as they would not then be able to make an adequate defence before Parliament of their abandonment of their right. Although the exchange of notes might not actually need ratification, and Parliament was not technically concerned with ratifications, it would be necessary for any new agreement to be laid before Parliament, and it would never do if parliamentary criticism could not be adequately met. On the other hand, if His Majesty’s Government were supplied with full and piecise infoimation as to the contemplated legislation Ministers would then be able to judge whether that legislation would enable them to meet parliamentary criticism and to carry Parliament with them when the right of manumission came to be abandoned. The question whether the modification of a treaty instrument which had been ratified would itself need ratification- %.e., whether he proposed exchange of notes would have to be subject to ratifica tion was a question somewhat outside his province, on which the necessary technical advice would be obtained. ece3'2- 5 at ctoii ^ Sai mission, be puri that | ^ the ai ulgate, | ;0 conuii^ ^overnii ^t with, ^etheaci ; importat : carried i nust be ii lanmnissit ich the ri| satisfaete Lbandoni; :onteinplafc ,udi 6oTec be actaal lanumissic )n had k had fa: ioning the i beensti with, of. must hai( Govern! md in i but binl fertainlif ion; (2)' : ation oft prolong ee suggest a the natt' Qpossible 1 irliamentf s might i ^erned ^ laid juld m*: 3 re supr j Mini*’ ienit«i* ie ri# 1 lificaW' itifiot'f tor# FUAD BEY HAMZA then said that if His Majesty’s Government, rather than prolong the Treaty of Jedda as proposed, preferred to wait until an entirely new treaty could be negotiated, or for any other reason did not wish to prolong the treaty in the manner now proposed, the Saudi Government would not object. In that event, he suggested that the question of slavery and manumission could be simply dealt with in a separate exchange of notes without bringing in the Treaty of Jedda at all. Mr. RENDEL pointed out that this was an entirely new suggestion, and doubted whether it would be a satisfactory one. In practice the Jedda settlement, i.e., the Treaty of Jedda and notes attached thereto, had always been treated as a whole. There might well be serious objections to any attempt to deal with the settlement piecemeal, and he thought that His Majesty’s Government would probably prefer Fuad Bey’s original suggestion, that the Treaty of Jedda should be prolonged and agreed modifications introduced by an exchange of notes covering all the ground. This led to a further discussion of the prolongation or modification of the exchange of notes (Nos. 5 and 6) regarding purchases of arms by the Saudi Government. Mr. RENDEL suggested, and FUAD BEY agreed, that this was a point of form rather than of substance. There was no question of His Majesty’s Govern ment treating the Saudi Government in a less favourable way than any other friendly country in a similar position. The question of arms traffic was not dealt with in his department, and he would have to consult the competent authorities before saying more than this. By the words £C in a similar position ” he meant there were certain countries where, in the interests of the Governments concerned, it had been internationally agreed that arms should only be supplied to the Governments themselves or to importers specifically approved by those Govern ments. The intention of this arrangement had been to prevent arms being used by rebel tribesmen, and he cited the revolt of Ibn Rifada as one where the limitation of the import of arms to approved importers operated to the advantage of King Abdul Aziz. If then there were some such general international limitation applicable to countries in the same position as Saudi Arabia, he did not think any difficulty need be caused by provision being made for it in any arrangements between His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Government. It would be time enough, however, to decide what were the most suitable arrange ments on this point when agreement had been reached on the main question of the prolongation of the Jedda settlement and of the abandonment of His Majesty’s Government’s right of manumission. An allusion was also made to the question of the prevailing language of the treaty. Mr. RENDEL said that this was also mainly a formal and technical point on which the competent authorities would have to be consulted in due course. At the conclusion of the meeting SIR A. RYAN undertook to produce a single comprehensive statement of the position reached in his discussions on slavery with Fuad Bey, showing the lines on which the Saudi Government might be prepared to legislate. Steps might also be taken, he thought, to consult other departments of the Foreign Office regarding the arms traffic and the technical questions of form that had been mentioned. oTelegram R.

He asserted that-dues were levied at gates of Kuwait itself on goods leaving town which everyone knew were to be smuggled i i.e, smuggling received official countenance. - 2* Ibn Saud had decided to take strong measures but I was being informed for information of His Majesty’s Government and Kuwait before they were introduced# In future until customs dispute was settled -ny Kuwaiti entering Saudi Arabia would be regarded as ’’criminal” and severely dealt with and tribes harbouring trespassers would be punished* Yusuf Yasin said that note embodies above mut he ishowever mis, sie. 3, I replied that I much regretted view I had now heard. 1 expressed emphatically Kuwait had made sincere attempts to arrive at settlement recapitulating their proposals and His Majesty’s Government’s willingness to support Kuwait in carrying out an honourable undertaking* I described demand of Ibn Saud in regard to prohibition of smuggling as one no government could accept or carry out (as Fuad was informed /V 2 - 1 -4 informed in London). I expressed the opinion that if smuggling was unfortunately on the increase acceptance of Kuwait suggestions would be best calculated to check it. In stressing importance attached to whole question by His Majesty’s Government I said that action now m&amp;ki in preventing free movement over frontier ignored views of His Majesty’s Government and Kuwait expressed in two Legation notes. 4. Yusuf Yasin said I saw Saudi reply I should gather that Ibn Saud subscribed to principle of freedom of movement over frontier as was age long practice. Present restrictions were provisional. 5. He continued that he was authorised to discuss question further with me by personal exchange of views.

Your Royal Highness, After Compliments, I have the honour to refer to the communications which have passed between the Saudi Linistry for Foreign Affairs and this Legation regarding the Kuwait conference, ending with the telephone message from As 1 ad 3e w . al Faqih of the 7th July last, informing me that the Saudi delegates had returned to Riyadh upon the breakdown of the conference. 2. Your Royal Highness is, of course, aware that this question was recently the subject of further conversations in London between the departments of His Lajesty r s Govern ment concerned and His Excellency Fuad Bey Hamza, who, as a result, undertook to refer the matter again to the Saudi Government for their consideration. I am now instructed to enquire whether Your Royal Highness’s Government are in a position to place me in possession of their views on this question, in the light of the renewed consideration they have doubtless given to it consequent upon the London conversations. 3. I feel impelled once more to draw the attention of Your Royal Highness to the importance which my Government and the Government of Inaia attach to the settlement of this question and I would strongly urge the Saudi Govern ment to agree to the proposals put forward by tne dele gation of His Excellency”the Shaikh of Kuwait at the recent conference. For their ^art, I assure Your Royal Highness / Royal Highness The Minister for Foreign Affairs.0 - 2 - Highness, as His HxceHSixCy Fuad Bey Hamza was similariy assured inLondon, my Goverment would do all they coula to ensure the fulfilment of the honourable undertaking offered by His dxcellenc^ the Shaikh, which in their view is all tnat can reasonably be demanded.

His Majesty Government consider that Saudi Govern- -ment demand for guarantee from Kuwait that no smuggler shall ever cross frontier is unreasonable and they regret to observe that no consideration has apparently been given to your note of August 12th. 5 !

Saudi Government have no desire to revert to armed incursion incident concerning which sufficient has been said. 3. As to responsibility of present situation Kuwait and not Saudi Government must be ?blamed as latter had not asked to interfere in Kuwait affairs, that they (Saudis) should be responsible for losses caused them by Kuwait. Saudi de*iand(s) of Kuwait were below (limit) and were reasonable as far as it was possible to go. Offer made by Saudi representatives (mut) ed loss to Saudi commerce and government regretted that these sacrifices which they had been prepared to make in their desire for an understanding were characterised as unreasonable. 4. Whenever Kuwait is prepared to guarantee prevention of smuggling on the basis mentioned by Yusuf Yasin to me an agreement will be possible but not unless an2 - an absolute guarantee of entire prevention be given. - CHARGE D * AF.FAIBSS - Copy given to Political Agent, Kuwaitg!

Attitude of Sa’udi Government which is apparently still that by which they deliberately torpedoed Kuwait Conference is most disappointing. 2. S&amp;aikh on my return through Kuwait again appealed to me most earnestly on question of blockade, /s the result of his conversations in England he has evidently high hopes that Ris Majesty’s Government mean to implement their assurance on the subject of the blockade and failure to do so now on our part even though circumstances may be difficult t vail mean that his trust in our good intentions towards him will receive a severe and most undesirable shock which will hve repercussions in the other &gt;rab States of the Gulf. 3. I quite realise the importance of treating Bin 3a’ud liberally bbt I have always felt (see for instance # my telegram He.T.112 of 8th June) that the Kuwait Blockade should be made the acid test of the desire of the sa’udi Government for our friendship. 1 venture to suggest there fore whether, in view of the persistent unfriendly attitude dfche sa’udi Goveraaent over this poirt, it would not be practicable / Telegram From To Repe&amp;t edBy Air Mail. uT V 0 v.z.-i^rz 19 INDIA OFFICE, LONDON, 2 5 0CH955 Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political Department, India Office.

(Ends). 2. Yusuf Yasin informs me that wording of Saudi note at this particular point is that of Ibn Saud himself. He added that although it was not clearly stated passage should be interpreted | to moan that Koweit 'and those who interfere in her affairs' must bear responsibility.

Request by Ibn Saua that the Bedouin Camel Law of 'Arafa' should be mutually accepted and worked as between Kuwait and Oaudi Arabia subjects. Sir, I have the honour to forward translation of a letter with Mulhaq from H.M.King Ibn saud to His Excellency the Sheikh of Kuwait dated 6 th November 1955 and which the latter has sent me for information. 2 . As will be seen the King asks that the well known Bedouin Law of 'Arafa' applicable to lost and stolen camels, which are subsequently claimed by owners, should be recognized by both States,and worked in friendly consultation. 3 .

It is well known to you, my Brother, that the two countries are one and the same, and that there always happen to be claims for camels lost both by your tribesmen against ours, and by our t ibesmen against yours. The owner of the camel lost usually comes from your side and says: 'This is my camel which I know very well'. ^hen we make enquiry from the person in whose custody the camel is found, the latter says that he has bought it from the Bhamriar, Dhafir etc. Likewise some of thera say they have bought the camel in Kuwait; others in lassa and so on. This makes matters very difficult indeed. If you approve of it, the best thing for us and our subjects will be to act as follows: ^uay camel that is taken from tribesmen of Kuwait an&lt; is sold to our tribesmen or in our territory, (which in real ity belongs to Kuwait persons) and when the purchaser of such camel cannot say or gi /e the name of the man from whom he bought the animal, then such camel shall be restored to its owner. further the man with whom i t is recognized shall be bound to search for the seller himself. Similarly, should a Nejd subject recognize his camel wi th a Kuwait subject, and the latter soy he does not know the seller, the camel shall be restored to the owner, and it shall belen be up to the Kuwaiti to find out who the seller was. For, now, thanks to God, there are no hostilities: there is an understanding between us and the people of Iraq, ^yria, Palestine and Transjordan, that all looted properties should be restored, should you consider this suitable, then all depend on God’s decision and yours.

You Majesty stated that it was your considered view in regard to camel losses (between the subjects of both States), that wheij the owner recognized his property, the same should be taken from him (the holder) and restored to him and that the holder should then go and search for the seller (loan from whom he bought), as hostilities no longer exist, arid full arrangements to restore all spoils liive been made between Your Majesty and other (adjacent) countries.

I, your btee&amp;*» brother, am pleased with anything that Your Majesty proposes, because^ our* two countries and peoples are one and the same, .md by your safe existence they will Insha ’Allah remain in peace and tranquility for all time. As to the question of camel losses, I, your brother, have been enforcing this Code (nrafa law) since a long time: So that when the owner comes with or without a letter, gives evidence as to his nationality and proves his ownership, the camels claimed are restored to him, without further references. The holder is then told to go and search for the seller (man from f whom he bought) • In my letter dated 9th Ha jab 1354 (7.10.35) forwarded with your servant Ghazi al-Hafta, I informed Your Majesty about the said servant’s camel, that when the latter recognized it with al Charika, and the latter proved his having purchased it from Al Ha trash, who could not produce the seller, I took the camel from him and restored it to your servant: Ha trash is still searching for the seller.

The first consigiment, recorded at paragraph 145 of the Jedda Report for May, arrived by the s. s. “Alavi* about the middle of May and consisted of Rupees 400,000. it was followed on June 10th by a second consignment of an unspecified quantity of specie by the s.s. ^Jahangir*, and in September by a further shipment also by the s.s.^Jahangir*, of rupees 120,000, to Mhich a reference was made in Jedda Report for that month, paragraph 290, and by a consignment of twenty- five cases containing silver coins, estimated to amount to about Rupees 100,000, by the s.s. “Islami* on the 8th October.

Please refer to your letter No.C-319, dated the 19th November, and your telegram No.339, dated the 2nd December. in which you informed me that the Shaikh had told of which you are sending to me. 2. The Shaikh has acted quite correctly in showing Ibn Saud r s letter, and his reply, to you. This is what he promised to do when the question of his corresponding with Ibn Saud was raised by His Majesty's Government - vide paragraph 11 of your letter No.C-125, dated the 6th April 1934, copy forwarded to Secretary of State for India and the Government of India under my Printed letter No.358-S, dated the 20th April 1934, 3. I trust, however, there is no ulterior motive behind Ibn Baud's friendly advance. I have forgotten the little Latin I ever knew but a few tags remain one of which runs 8 Timeo Dana os etc. Since the ,, Arafa M law, as you point out in paragraph 4 of your letter, has been in opera tion since the time of Abraham, it is not clear why Ibn Saud should now raise the question in A.D.1935. You will remember that on a former occasion (vide my letter No.43 of 17th September 1932 to the Colonial Office, copy forwarded to the Government of India and His Majesty's Minister at Jedda under my Printed Letter No.673-S of 19th September 1932) the Shaikh, disregarding a warning from us to be on his / ut.-Colonel H.R.P.Dickson,C.1 .E., Political Agent, Kuwait- 2 - his guard, in connection with classes of claims fell into a trap laid for him by Ibn Saud v/ith most unfortunate results.

YOU will shortly be the guest of King Abdul Aziz at Riyadh. While there, i will be engaged in further negotiations on the subject of the eastern and ith-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia, and on the subject of slavery, on both which matters you have already received full instructions. 2. Though it is to be expected that these topics will occupy a great part the time available for political discussion at Riyadh, nevertheless I request ' it you will not fail at the same time to use every endeavour to secure an equate settlement from King Abdul Aziz on the subject of his blockade of )weit. As you are aware, this blockade has now been maintained for more in ten years, and as long ago as 1929 His Majesty’s Government promised the eikh of Koweit, in return for his co-operation which was loyally given in the terests of Ibn Sand during the Ikhwan rebellion, that they would do their best secure an honourable settlement of the question. During his visit to London is year the sheikh received assurances, to which he attaches the highest value, the interest of His Majesty’s Government in his affairs. I enclose a copy of telegram from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (No. 892 of the th October, 1935), which emphasises how unfortunate would be the reactions Koweit and in the Persian Gulf generally of any failure to secure a settlement the blockade question in the course of the Anglo-Saudi negotiations now in Dgress. On account of the political and strategic importance of Koweit (both :ual and potential) His Majesty’s Government are anxious to strengthen their endly relations with its ruler. For this and for other reasons they are bound pursuance of their promises to him to make every effort to secure a satisfactory flement and to defend his legitimate interests vis-a-vis his powerful neighbour. 3. You will recollect that the conference between Saudi and Koweiti legates, held at Koweit in the early part of the summer, dispersed without Sieving a settlement. From the series of letters exchanged by the delegations, which I enclose copies for your convenience, you are aware that King Abdul dz was ready to agree to the proposed method of controlling Saudi-Koweiti ide, namely, that trade should be directed to one or more customs posts on the ,udi side of the frontier and that all exports should be provided with manifests iued by the Sheikh of Koweit. You will recall, however, that His Majesty tached to his acceptance the condition that this arrangement should be auto- itically terminated if, after its institution, a single Koweiti was detected niggling. This demand the sheikh could not, of course, accept; but he offered, an alternative, a guarantee on his honour that he would do all in his power to ip smuggling and would severely punish offenders. King Abdul Aziz then dared this offer to be inadequate and instructed his delegates to break off the gotiations. . 4. The matter was then taken up in London during the conversations last mmer with Fuad Bey Hamza, the Saudi Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, which you yourself were present. It was explained to him that the Saudi 3vernment’s demand was most unreasonable, since no State, not even the most ghly organised, was in a position to give a guarantee that not a single case mid occur of its regulations being evaded, and he was informed that if King bdul Aziz would accept the sheikh’s alternative offer of an honourable under king His Majesty’s Government for their part would do all in their power ensure its observance. Fuad Bey, before leaving London, promised to look to the matter. 5. After some time had elapsed His Majesty s Charge d Affaires at Jedda, ting on my instructions, invited the Saudi Government to give him their views t the matter in the light of the consideration which it had doubtless received [531 hh—T] b2 in consequence of the conversation with 1 uad Bey Hamza in London. Mi\ Calvert drew the Saudi Government’s attention once more to the importance which His Maiesty’s Government and the Government of India attach to a solution of this problem and reiterated the willingness of His Majesty s Government to do all in their power to ensure that the honourable undertaking oilered by the sheikh should, if accepted, be observed. . i u a 6. Of this communication, which was dated the 12th August, no mention was made when the Saudi Government informed Mr. Calvert in a note dated the 1st September that in view of the increase in smuggling which the Saudi Govern ment alleged had taken place since the breakdown of the Koweit conference (but which was denied from Koweiti sources) they intended to enforce an even closer blockade and virtually to prohibit all movement across the Saudi-Koweiti frontier The Saudi Government were, therefore, reminded on the 16th September that a reply to Mr. Calvert's previous representations was still outstanding and thev were warned that if they insisted on demanding impossible conditions from Kovveit they would assume the sole responsibility for the present unsatisfactory situation. Copies of these two notes are enclosed. 7. On the 15th October the Saudi Government addressed to Mr. Calvert a note in reply to the above-mentioned communications. From the summary telegraphed by Mr. Calvert, the Saudi Government appear to have asserted that they had not sought to interfere in the affairs of Koweit and that responsibility for the present situation and for the loss which had been caused to Saudi Arabia thereby thus rested with Koweit and (as it would appear from oral explanations furnished by the Acting Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs) with His Majesty’s Government. They maintained, moreover, that the demands made by the Saudi delegation at the Koweit Conference might justifiably have been severer but that they were none the less reasonable in that they would have entailed loss to Saudi commerce and represented the utmost sacrifice which could be made. The Saudi (Government expressed regret that such sacrifices should have been characterised as unreasonable, and their note concluded by asserting that agreement on the matter would only be possible if Koweit were to give the required guarantee absolutely to prevent all smuggling. S. Such arguments are unacceptable to His Majesty's Government, who can only regard this note as evidence of an unsatisfactory and indeed obstructive attitude on the part of the Saudi Government. In particular, insistence on a literal acceptance of the condition which King Abdul Aziz seeks to attach to ai ^ 1 eemen t is manifestly unreasonable. I shall accordingly be glad if you will draw the serious attention of King Abdul Aziz to the matter at Riyadh. 9. You should begin, as on previous occasions, by reminding the King of the unremitting efforts which His Majesty's Government made to improve and consolidate relations, first between Saudi Arabia and Iraq and then between k au i Arabia and Transjordan. These efforts proved successful, and have led o settlements winch have been to the great advantage of all the parties concerned. ±iis Majesty s Government are now most earnestly desirous of bringing about a similar improvement in the case of relations between Saudi Arabia and Koweit.

I tiust that these arguments will not fail of their effect but if they do, you may use your discretion to inform King Abdul Aziz that His Majesty’s Government regard this matter as a test of his desire to establish \ndo-Saudi relations on an even more cordial basis than at present, and that it w ill increase the beneficial effects of your visit to His Majesty if it results in a happy solution of this long-standing and dangerous dispute. 12 . There is one further argument of which you may find it possible to make sonl e general use in conversation with King Abdul Aziz or with his Ministers. In his despatch No. 256 of the 10 th September, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires mentioned that Sheikh Muhammad Tawil, the Saudi Director of Customs in Hasa, had expressed himself to a member of His Majesty’s Legation as being in favour of a radical reduction of Saudi customs dues, a policy which he professed to have recommended to King Abdul Aziz. There appears to be little doubt that such a policy, if applied, would remove the cause of much of the smuggling which is now carried on into Saudi Arabia from Koweit, by reducing the disparity between the Saudi and the Koweiti customs dues. This policy would also encourage importers to land their goods on the Saudi coast rather than at Koweit, and would thus tend to promote one at least of the objects for which it is understood the present Saudi blockade of Koweit was instituted. I fear that it would be too much to expect that King Abdul Aziz can be easily induced to see the unwisdom of maintaining his customs duties at an almost prohibitive level, but I consider that, subject to your views, there may be advantage in explaining this aspect of the matter to him. I am, &amp;c. SAMUEL HOARE. , Enclosure 1. (becret.) Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to Secretary of State for India. (No. 892.) (Telegraphic.) Risher, October 25, 1935.

Sheikh, on my return through Koweit, again appealed to me mos earnestly on question of blockade. As result of his conversations in England he has evidently high hope that His Majesty’s Government mean to implement their assurance on the subject of blockade, and failure to do so now on our part, even though circumstances may be difficult, will mean that his trust in our goo intentions towards him will receive a severe and most undesirable shock, whic will have repercussions in other Arab States of the Gulf. , T 3.

Also that should this happen more than three times, His Majesty s baudi Govern ment should have the right to cancel the agreement. lrj At the same meeting we replied to you that the Koweit Government would give you their word of honour to do all in their power to prevent smugg _ x that should any smuggling be discovered (within her territory) e ^ ment would inflict the severest of punishments on the evl . . oel * _ntion As regards the “ guarantee ” insisted on by you wi e - t ^ reason _ taken and every goodwill, we say this cannot be realised. f able of you to make such a condition.

In order to impress on Ibn Saud the importance of this question in the eyes of His Majesty’s Government I put it secondonly to the eastern frontier question, when informing Euad Bey and later the King himself, of the subject I wished to discuss during my visit. 4 . You will observe that my conversation with Eaad Bey on November 26th was generally unsatisfactory. I think that he had already seen for himself that the not-a-single-case- 6 f- srauggling condition was absurd, but was mortally afraid of his master. By the next day, he had evidently persuaded the King to be more reasonable. 5. I consider that Euad Bey’s suggestions regarding the control of persons carrying goods require very careful scrutiny. I did not press him to define more precisely what he had in mind, because, while anxious to appear sympathetic 2 . I may mention that on the occasion of my first visit once / ?he Right Honourable Bir Samuel Hoare, GCSI.,GBE etc., etc. e etc. • &gt;!% - 2 - once I had gained the main point, I thought it better to wait and see how the suggestion, as stated in general terms by Fuad hi 1 1 ’ SlH Id: BP nsl! ’ 9 ho ill lii (ii i,; Oi [h ooi 18 800 s 1 J i: bIjb ^ 1 fe Bey, would strike the authorities in Kuwait from the point of ^ -- r view of practicality. 6 . I need hardly say that, if it should be at all possible to meet the views of the Saudi Government as now modified, I hope that the Kuwait authorities will do so and suggest practical arrangements. I think it would be best to continue the negotiations through this Legation, rather than suggest a resumption of the local conference. The great thing, in my opinion, is now to advance as soon as possible to an exchange of notes, in the hope that Ibn Saud may then relax his blockade measures, and to see over a period of six months or a year how the new arrangements work. I think that Ibn Gaud was greatly impressed by the argument that his attitude hitherto has been inconsistent with his professions of friendship for His Majesty’s Government. 7. I ventured to discuss with Colonel Fowle and the Political Agents, quite privately and without in any way pre^judging your views, a suggestion of my own that it would strengthen the position vis-a-vis Ibn Saud in discussions affecting Kuwait (and Bahain), if means could be found to confer upon the Shaikh (and on the Shaikh of Bahrain, for similar i-easons) the title of*His Highness”* As I explained to the Political Resident, I am well aware that this guggestion may present difficulty from other points of viev, but I have long felt that, in correspondence with the Saudi Government, in which I have so often to impress on them the importance attached by His Majesty’s Government to the position of the Shaikh of Kuwait (and that of the Shaikh of Bahrain) as an independent ruler, I should have to use the title of M His Excellency”, which, however respectable, is normally borne by subjects andwhich, moreover, / sfir v - In rrty preliminary buginens oonversation with Fuad Bey on November 24th, the day after ray arrival, I put this second which Ibn Baud had demanded and to the Shaikh’s counter proposal that he should give his word of honour to do all in his power to prevent smuggling; the readiness of His Majesty*s Government to back this; and to their difficulty in reconciling the King’s attitude with his repeated professions of friendship towards themselves* 2* I mentioned the subject to the King at the outset of my first business audience cn November 25th, but had no _ opportunity of pursuing it then or at aray second business &gt; audience next day, as the only subject discussed in detail was that of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers. In the event, as will be seen , I found it better tactics not to tackle His Majesty at all about Kuwait but to apply pressure Mf through Fuad Bey. 3. Fuad Bey broached the subject at luncheon on Movernber 26tn and stressed the importance of manifests. After luhcheon I proved to him that this was provided for in tne letter from the Kuwait delegation to the Saudi delegates at Kuwait ol June 17th, 1935. I gave him the translations of that and the ensuing papers in the Foreign Office print enclosed in Foreign Office despatch No.317 (E. 6419 / 206 / 25 } of October among the questions which I particularly wished to discuss during my visit. I outlined the views of His Majesty’s Government referring to their strong desire to get this question settled, as the Iraq and Trans-Jordon questions had been settled; to the impossible character of the 'guarantee 31st to Jedda. Fuad Bey then developed the argument that ,Kuwait / L-^iKuwait could not do without smuggling. I demurred to this on the ground that the main advantage which such a place derived from being an entrepot was that its merchants handled trade. I denied that smuggling was essential to the prosperity of Kuwait as he had'suggested, though I admitted that the temptation to indulge in it was great in cases such as the present when there was so enormous a disparity between the Kuwaiti and Saudi customs duties. (I had already tried to draw him on the question whether the Saudi Government intended to reduce their duties - see paragraph 12 of the Foreign Office despatch already quoted - buthe professed complete ignorance on this subject). 4. Fuad Bey, who was not I think very conversant with what had passed during his absence from this country, tried to make out that the 'guarantee* demanded by the Saudi delegates at Kuwait was not in fact a guarantee that not a single case of smuggling should take place. I demolished this suggestion, whereupon Fuad Bey, making no attempt to defend the guarantee, which had been asked for, suggested that other guarantees would be i necessary. He outlined a system of passports or identity certificates for persons carrying goods. I said that something might be done on those lines but I rejected a proposal of Fuad Bey*s that I should forthwith draft a note embodying not only the two formulae in the Kuwaiti delegates* letter of June 17th but a system of further precautions against smuggling. I pointed out that I could not draft anything except i n consulta tion with the authorities concerned and that, if the Saudi Government wished for further guarantees, it was for them to say what they wanted. Replying to a complaint of his that the Kuwaiti delegates had made no counter-proposals regarding guarantees, I said that they had had no opportunity of doing so.as the Saudi delegates had taken them by the throat and had made acceptance of the form of guarantee demanded by them a condition sine qua non of continuing negotiations. 5. I defending his suggestion that I should draft a note, Fuad Bey let fall the incautious remark that he had no interest in the matter and that it was I who was pressing for a settlement. I told him that he certainly ought to be interested. Kuwait was the natural source of supply for the adjoining parts of Saudi Arabia and it could not be to the advantage of the Saudi Government to maintainvis-a-vis of their own subjects a system to enforce which smuggling had been made a capital offence. Fuad Bey rejoined that the Saudi Government were the best judge of how to treat their subjects. I invoked general principles of sound administration and then said that, in any case, his Government had one very strong interest in a settle ment. His Majesty f E Government, I said, attached the utmost importance to the question. I bn Saud assured them at every turn of his friendship. But, in this particular case, his attitude was inconsistent with his professions of frienobhip for His Majesty’s Government, who were bound to uphold the interests of the Shaikh of Kuwait. 6 . In the end I again pressed Fuad Bey to tell me definitely what the Saudi Government wanted. Fuad Bey replied that he had no authority to make any suggestions and we left the subject. 7. When Fuad Bey called again on November 26th, I had re-read my papers and was better prepared for him. I attached him all along the line, pointing out that the Kuwait delegates had in fact offered an alternative guarantee to that demanded by the Saudi delegates. They had offered a pledge by the Shaikh to use all his endeavours to prevent smuggling. his Majesty’s Government had since offered to back those endeavours by their own. /f/OH /T&gt; -4- own* Fuad Bey asked ♦hat form the action of His Majesty’s Government would take. Would the Political Agent be responsible? I said^ that, if His Majesty’s Government gave a pledge it would be for them to judge of the means of giving effect to it, but that doubtless any action that they took would be taken through the Political Agent. 6 . Fuad Bey drew me out as to what I considered would meet the case. I said that in my view all that was necessary was an : 4 exchange of notes incorporating heads (l) and ( 2 ) in the Kuwait delegates’ letter of June 17th plus the Shaikh’s pledge and the assurance that His Majesty’s Government would do all they could to ensure its fulfilment. I added that, while I had no instructions about a time-limit and did not know how my Govern ment would view the suggestion, I should be prepared to recommend a provision in the exchange of notes, similar to that in the recent Bahrain transit notes, enabling either party to terminate the arrangement by an agreed short notice. This would give the Saudi Government a remedy, if smuggling became in fact ^ serious. 9. During this first part of the conversation, I told Fuad Bey that he had shocked me by two of his statements the day before, when he had said that he had no interest in the settle ment of the question and later that he had no authority to make suggestions. As regards the first, I xp repeated trhat I had said previously. As regards the second, if the effective Minister for Foreign Affairs of the country told me he had no authority, I could only lay the natter before the person who possessed it, i.e. the King. 10. Fuad Bey resorted to one of^his favourite devices and begged me to be practical. He then came into the open, having evidently /■Ml m evidently got the King’s consent to a partial surrender. He said that four points had already been put forward, viz. He said that the King had now decided to a tendon the condition proposed by the Saudi delegates at Kuwait but considered that, in addition to the above safeguards, means should be found to control persons engaged in trade with reference to whether 11 . I agreed to submit this proposal for consideration, k£±ng making it clear that in my opinion it would be necessary to ^ define clearly what persons should be covered. I pointed ^ out that different classes of persons crossed the frontier for different purposes, regular traders, persons wishing to supply their own aaac needs and others e.g. sportsmen. I did not exclude the possibility of control on the lines suggested of persons engaged in trade, but I understood it was in accordance with local custom that movements generally across t. frontier should be as little restricted as possible. 1 had been told tn Kuwait that movement for the purpose of hawking, for instance, was considered quite a special thing, which should be free. 12. Fuad Bey reverted to the questions of manifests. Gould they be given in all cases? And what would happen, if a man (1) Manifests. (2) The Shaikh’s pledge. {?&gt;) His Majesty’s Government’s assurance. (4) My personal suggestion regarding time-limit they were (a) Subjects of Saudi Arabia coming from Hejd. (b) Subjects of Saudi Arabia resident in Kuwqit. (c) Kuwaiti subjects. (d) Subjects of third powers, like Iraq, Iran, etc. took /- 6 - took out goods, professing to be bound say, for Iraq when his real intention was to import them into Saudi Arabia ? He thought that the Kuwe.it authorities themselves might find it embarrassing to have to supply the Saudi agent, An Nafisi, with all manifests* He considered that there should be stringent penalties for false representations as to destina tion* 13. Fuad Bey added two further suggestions. Fixed routes, should, he said, be specified, fhe provision for them implied in the word 'guiding” in the Kuwaiti delegates* letter of June 17th was not in his view sufficient. Secondly, the manifest system should extend to dhows, as goods might be embarked in dhows for the Saudi coast. 14. Fuad Bey assured me that the King was animated by tiosx no spirit of hostility. I thanked him for his assurance and said that I was quite willing to have all his suggestions examined. I said that in view of what he had told me I no longer considered it necessary to trouble the King personally• ANDREy RYAN. Riyadh.

My dear Walton, You will have seen from the copy of Jedds/ despatch ao. 352 of the 10th December enclosed in our official letter, numbered as above, of olst December, that Ryan did his utmost at Riyadh to make the Saudis see reason about their blockade at Kuwait and was apparently able to make considera progress towards a settlement. The supplementary* instructions which were sent to him in our despatch No.324 of 7th November (please see our official letter E 6475/206/25 of the same date) were evidently useful and it is satisfactory to know that Ibn Saud seems at least to have realised that we feel strongly on the subject. 2. Our first impression is that the general basis at which Ryan arrived with Fuad Hamza for a resumption of the negotiatioa is promising, and that we can give it our blessing in principle, subject, of course, to the views of the authorities in the Gulf and to satisfactory arrangements being found possible for the system of control on the Saudi-Kuwai t frontier envisaged by Fuad Hamza. 3. As regards the particular points in Ryan’s despatch, we think that there is much force in the suggestion in paragraph 6 that it would be preferable to resume negotiations through the Legation at Jedda, since we feel that this is likely to lead to their being conducted in a calmer and more reasonable spirit than would be the case if they were left to another local conference between Arab delegations. 4. I am not sure whether I entirely agree with the suggestion / J.G.Walton Esq.,CB.,MCfof Kuwait and Bahrain should have the title of w Highne8s M I conferred upon them. It is not so much that suggestion itself which I question as the motive on which it appears to be based. It seems to us that there would be considerable risk in doing anything to emphasise the importance of these Shaikhs 'as independent rulers', since, although we wish to emphasise their independence of Saudi Arabia and of Iraq, I think you will agree that we certainly do not wish to weaken in any way their dependence on His Majesty’s Government. On the contrary I think we are all in agreement that we should aim at tightening up our control over the Shaikhs; and it is surely as part of this policy that we have so long been insisting that all political correspondence between them and I bn Saud must pass through us. Apart from this general i consideration might it not be very difficult to accord a rise in dignity to the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Bahrain without doing likewise to the Shaikh of Q,atar, whose reputation and conduct seems very far from meriting such a distinction ? Moreover, the lesser Trucial fry would probably also begin to agitate for a rise in status. 5. The only renaining individual point upon which we wish to comment at this stage is that of a time liirit for any eventual agreement with the Saudi Government, which Ryan raises in paragraph 8 of the record of conversations enclosed in his we naturally would not wish to encourage the Saudis to denounce any agreement that we were eventually able to put through, we feel it is impossible to expect the Saudis to tie despatch. We think that Ryan’s suggestion may prove a useful inducement to the Saudis to conclude an agreement, and while themselves /theme elvee down to an agreement of a perpetual character, fou will remember that a provision of the nature suggested by Ryan was inserted in the Bahrain Transit Dues Agreement in deference to the wishes of the Bahrain (lovernment, and we do not think that we can consistently deny the same privilege to the Saudis if it was to their advantage in the present case* f y 6. The question now arises of the procedure for pursuing the negotiations further. You vifill remember that when we saw Powle’s express let ter i*o.958-S of the 10th December (a copy of which was enclosed in your official letter P.z. 9042 of 18th December), in which he proposes to instruct Dickson to approach the Shaikh of Kuwait immediately the full record of Ryan , s conversations reached him, we suggested to you that it would be desirable to hold up local action in the 'klf until we had had an opportunity in London to examine the results of Ryan’s negotiations, and to prepare a preliminary expression of the views of &amp;&amp; His Majesty’s Government. ¥ ou agreed with our suggestion and sent your telegram Wo.4088 of the 24 th December to Fowle, warning him to delay the/approach to the Shaikh until receipt of the comments of His Majesty’ s Government. //**&lt;* if} ^ ication Fowle giving him a preliminary expression oft lie views of His Majesty’s Government and instructing him to go ahead with the consultation of the Shaikh of Kuwait. If you agree generally with the view I have expressed in paragraphs 2-5 above, I suggest for your consideration that the best course might now be to prepare in the first instance a draft express letter or telegram to Kowle, in which you would no doubt give us an opportunity of concurring. Obviously any views expressed on the Saudi proposals could only be general and preliminary in character, an we diall have to leave it to the authorities / /3 / 6 7. We have, therefore, now to concert a communication toBOnHHHBBaHEME -4“ / V r '/ii authorities in the Gulf to make detailed criticisms and suggestions for the necessary arrangements for putting them into effect, if possible, TBut, if you see no objection, we should like to take up the. three individual points mentioned in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 abov e.

That one copy of the manifest would be given to the caravan leader, a second to the Saudi trade Agent here, and a third kept by the Kuwait Gover- ment - Lastly that the Saudi Government must trust to Your Excellency*s word of honour, to play fair, and see that all other caravans proceeding to Nejd, that happened to come in without documents, travel or otherwise, would be given mani fests and treated as if they had docj^ pn±^ T At the end of your talk with the Political Resident Your Excellency made it quite clear that the manifest system proposed could and would only apply to organized caravans carrying goods for trade purposes to Saudi/OojJX.

There should only be a watch kept for what goods he would take, and a full des cription of such goods should be given in the manifests issued here.

Sir, In continuation of my telegram iio.77, dated the 29th February 1936, I have the honour to say that His Sxcellency the Shaikh of Kuwait has agreed in principle to the proposals put forward by the Saudi Mrab Government to K-ir iindrew *yan at Biyadh with a view to a settlement of the Kuwait Trade Blockade. 2. I enclose copies of letters on the subject exchanged by this agency yd th the nhaikh. 3. It will be seen that His excellency delayed nearly a month in replying to this agency letter. This was due partly to the visit of King .ubdul *zlz partly to the fact that at this time of year the wh&amp;ikh necessarily spends some time in the desert and outside Kuwait at his country residence, but also because he was obliged to consider carefully where agreement to the proposals would lead him.

He further informed Your hccellency that as a result of Sir Andrew Ryan’s discussions the haudi Government had put forward the following- proposals:- (1) That Your Excellency should institute a system of manifests as suggested in head 2 of the letter dated 16th Rabi Auwal 1354 (17.6. 35) from Your Excellency’s delegates at the conference, on this question held at Kuwait. The ,„audi delegates wish this manifest system system to be extended to goods carried by dhows. (2) That customs posts should be established as in head (1) of the Kuwait delegates letter referred to above, and that fixed routes should be specified.

Your views on the above proposals were as follow si ll) Your Excellency agreed to the issue of manifests as already proposed, also Your Excellency agreed to extend such manifest system, to goods carried by dhows. (2) Your Excellency agreed to the establishment of customs posts, as proposed, also that fixed routes should be specified on the manifests. (3) Your Excellency agreed to give the pledge referred to. (4) Your Excellency stated that while the ^audi Government were entirely at liberty to issue any special permits which they chose to caravan leaders, such as issuing of certificates of Identity, authorizing them to proceed to Kuwait and purchase supplies up to certain limits, or pass through certain customs posts on the inward journey to Kuwait, you your soIf must definitely decline to issue any fom of Certificates of Identity, or other control documents at the Kuwait end for out,ping caravans or individuals, as there would neither be need for such action nor would it be practicable seeing that caravans exporting goods would come in from isejd and go out again, and no Kuwaiti caravans would be engaged in such trade. Your Excellency further stated that all you cou agree to was to issue manifests to caravan leader giving particulars of goods carried, as well as ordering them (the leaders) to proceed to such and such customs posts. That one copy oi the id fest would be given to the caravan leader, a s to the Eaudi trade Agent here, and a thira ke the Kuwait Government - Lastly that trie Eaudj Government must trust to Your Excellency’s *- b - trust to your iucoellenoy’ s word of honour, to play fair, and see that all other caravans proceeding to Kejd, that happened to come in without documents, travel or otherwise, would be given manifests and At the end of your talk with the political hesident Tour Excellency made it quite clear that the manifest system proposed could and would only apply to organized caravans carrying goons for' trade purposes to ^audi .^rabia, and that on no account could Your excellency agree to the issue of manifests to poor Badawins coming tup to Kuwait to buy their daily bread and meagre necessities of life. That suen form of snap ping was known as Tt musab&amp;iah' ( , and was a privilege which could not be denied to the unfortunate tribesmen under any circumstances. Your .Excellency added that should the naudi Government consider that the petty daily food require ments of the poor tribesmen (whether they lived in Kuwait territory or just across the hejd or Iraq border came under the category of smug .ling, then the responsibility for stopping such must lie with the daudi Government, not with you, for you feared God.

After Compliments, In continuation of my letter Ko.K-4/3384, dated the 28th Dhil .^a f dah 1554 (21.2*56) , I beg to inform you that the points comprising what I discussed with the Hon’ble the Political resident in the Persian Gulf on 24.1.56 on the subject of the Gaudi trade Blockade of Kuwait, and which you reported in your letter No.C-31, dated the 25th January 1936 - that all the views that I have proposed to the Resident, as given in your letter mentioned above, from para 1 to para 5 are in consistency with my desires. I only except one thing: it is the limitation to of the goods that a trader would take according/the permit he holds, as proposed by the ^-audi Government. This question I do not consider to be suitable. My view in this connection is that the trader who, for instance, holds a permit to \ buy ten loads of commodities, and who at this end thinks of taking more, or vice versa - that such a trader should not be prevented from doing so. There should only be a watch kept for what goods he would take, and a full description of such goods should be given in the manifests issued here. This method X consider as suitable for the convenience and the interests of both sides* As to the question of promise, as I have pointed out to you in my above letter, I give my word of honour to do all assistance possible in the interests of both sides.

Thanks, Usual Ending.Please refer to my official letter No.0-80 of today’s date about the Kuwait Blockade. I am not quite sure how the matter will now be dealt with but I suggest from whet is already clear to me after talking to the Shaikh that it might be a mistake to use the material of Agoncy letter No.G-31 for a camuunication to the ^aucii Arab Government as the Phaikh is apt to make exceptions and suggest amendments already. He does this in no carping way but with a view to covering all the various difficulties which may arise. If therefore the details already mentioned are used we might find that different constructions were put on them by the Shaikh and the w&amp;udi Arab Government and that when it came to embodying them in an article of agreement or regulations, one or the other/kecused the other party of going bade on his word. 2. I fancy that as far as the Gaudi Arab Government is concerned beyond the agreement in principle to the proposals, it would be best to keep them in the dark until we are ready to present them with a draft Kuwait regulations for the control of caravans which with its explanatory letter from the Ahaikh should show in a clear fashion how the proposals would work out in detail. 0 r ^*4-**-o M '' (UfA Uhe Hon’ble Lt.-Colonel T.G.i’owle, C.B.G., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B U G H I K A .CONFIDENTIAL.
