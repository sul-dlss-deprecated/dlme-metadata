The principal correspondents in the file are the Political Agent in Bahrain (Hugh Weightman); the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Geoffrey Prior).The file begins with a letter from the Political Agent to the Resident, dated 5 November 1939 (f 2), expressing concern that the Government of Bahrain’s recently acquired ammunition supplies are of First-World-War vintage, and not suitable for modern guns. The Political Agent asks if India might be persuaded to make a present of 100,000 rounds to Bahrain, given that ‘Muscat is getting rifles and ammunition for nothing’ and with the Government of Bahrain having given £30,000 to the British Government as a contribution towards the costs of the war. The remaining correspondence relates to this gift of 100,000 rounds, sent during 1940 in two consignments of 15,000 rounds and 85,000 rounds, in June and July respectively. A letter from the Political Agent to the Ruler of Bahrain, Shaikh Ḥamad bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah, dated 1 April 1940, informing him of the gift (f 19), and Shaikh Ḥamad’s reply, dated 3 April 1940 (f 20) are included in the file.The file notes (f 44) indicate that the file contained correspondence up to October 1945, however the items of correspondence from 1945, as indicated in a note written in the margin of the file notes, were moved to file 4/25. As a result, the latest date of correspondence in the file is 25 January 1941.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Ammunition</topic></subject><subject><topic>Gifts</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00002f#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00002f#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00002f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
