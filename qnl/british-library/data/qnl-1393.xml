I No. 1579, dated 8thNovember i i i j j • i i j.r. i p ii • 18tW&gt; nave been led to examine closely the records ot this office, in order that before the British Government enters upon any fresh arrangements with the Murrees or other Khelat subjects, it may have before it, an historical outline of the principal events which have occurred from the commencement of the present Khan's reign to this time. 2. It is solely from a deep sense of the national importance of the questions under discussion that I would thus subject the occurrences of the past year in the Khelat State to the test of previous history; reading them in the light which that history throws upon them as continuous events inseparable from it. o. The opinions expressed arc offered with the greatest deference ; in a spirit of fair enquiry. I find that there is nothing new in the generality of them,. for though formed from personal observation, and br,«r, F&lt;!

As Political Superintendent on this Frontier, I both have carried out, and will continue to give effect to, whatever orders may be issued, I however solicit that the evidence of the records now produced may receive consideration.

November 1869. ^| ie p ron ^ er | 0 r eview the exact state of our rela tions with the Khan, his Chiefs, and people. The followinof abridired narrative of those relations from the commence- O O ment of the reign of Khodadad Khan to the present time is drawn up for the information of Government, in order that the causes of the distracted state of the country may be traced with the view to their being remedied. 2. Our original object and intention in entering upon the Treaty of tlie 14th May 1854 will be briefly stated, in order that an opinion may be arrived at as to how far those objects have been realized, or are likely to be so under a continuance of the internal disorders which convulse Beloochistan throughout from the Bolan to the Mekran Coast. 3. Public documents only will be quoted, so that if fuller information be required upon any point separately, it may be gathered from perusing the original of any of them. 4. When Brigadier General Jacob offered the Treaty of May 1854 for the acceptance of the late Khan of Khelat, he endeavoured amongst other matters to impress the following upon the mind of the Khan. 'From the first day of my receiving charge of the Frontier of Sind, I ,, have exerted every effort in my power to brino- about Extract from General Jacob s ' • J 0 t Heads of Conference with the the establishment of order and cfood o-overnment in Khan your Highness' neio-hbourino- dominions. But I %} o o o labored to little or no purpose, because 1 was always secretly thwarted by your Highness' officers.' * * * * « 'My sole object and that of my Government in this business is that there maybe a strong and friendly Government established ..flkSr' h0S ' mty 0f K1,elat throughout the dominions of your Highness. To bring this about, it is necessary that the officers of your Highness should be faithful, active and united.' * * 'Justice should be strictly administered to all men. Cultivators and traders should be encouraged and protected, roads made safe and easy, and no private transit or such like exaction should be allowed to either great or small. All this cannot be accomplished without exertion, but if your High ness attend to this advice and act on it, the State of Khelat will, under your Highness' rule, by God's blessing, become rich, powerful, respected; but( 10 ) wltuout some such arrungement and efforts from no amount of external assistance alone will make it really strong and flourishing * * Such measures only can lead to the happiness and prosperity of your Highness, your nobles, and your people.' About 2 years after this. Major (now Sir Henry) Green was appointed Major Henry Green's report ]&gt;olu,eal ^ ent at Khelat, and he commences his re- dated 4th Decemder 1858. poi t, quoted in the margin, by saying that he formed a very high opinion of His Highness Meer Nnsseer Khan, hut not of his advisers, one being a Merchant by name Faiz Mahomed, and the other a Bunyah named Gungaram. He first joined him in December 1856, but in January 1857 had to leave to join the Persian Expeditionary Force, and did not return to his Khelat ap- pointment until Xovember 18.37. Tn those few months the old Khanazad Darogali, Gool Mahomed, the bitter enemy of the British Government, beino; unable to ^ir Henry Greens report of • ^ # 0 4th December 1858. gain over JN usseer Kuan to liis traitorous desio-ns, conspired with the 13eebee Cudjiss, the mother of the present Khan, a woman of low birth and infamous character, to murder his half-brother Nusseer, on the understanding that he (the Darogah) should be the confidential adviser of his successor Khooda Jad. Tn May 18.57 the Meer Nusseer Khan was travelling from Gundava to Conduct of Khelat Khanazads Khelat ; ™^OUt tlie middle of the Moolla Pass simultaneously with the out- was seized with an attack of the maladv from which hivak of the mutinies. i i • i • i , ' lie surteicd, viz, stone in the bladder. He was however inipioNing in health, and marched on to Angera, where he received a packet of letters from the Darogah Gool Mahomed by the hand of a confidential ser- \aht of the Darogah s, a barber by trade, who also brought some medicine for 11.^ Jl ighness. ihis barber administered some of the medicine, when alone with the Khan, after which he left.

The Darogah Gool Mahomed's first object was to sow distrust between the young Khan and his Chiefs, who were then encamped outside the walls of the city, and also to set them against each other by means of bribery, &amp;c. This was gradually accomplished, and when the Darogah ,f considered ' that every thing was ready for a coup d'etat, he suddenly and without warn- ' ing at daybreak on the morning of the 17th September 17th, 1857.

' mediately to open fire on the camp of the Chiefs. The Khan's mercenary Troops. ' The Chiefs were totally unprepared, and having ' but few of their retainers with them, could offer ' but little resistance, and were driven from the valley with loss !' ' Those who happened at the time to be on the side of the Khan felt ' themselves bound to remain so. Thus father and son became opposed to ' each other. The Darogah thus repeated the very same act which he had ' performed upwards of 40 years before in the days of Mehrab Khan.' ' The young Khan (Khoodadad) was informed that these men were plotting ' to dethrone him, and the Chiefs enraged at their treatment, assembled with ' their retainers at Sorab, about 40 miles south of Khelat, to the number of ' .3 or 6,000 men ; but not finding provisions there, they returned to Khoz- d:ir, one ot the Khan's granaries, which they plundered ; and where they levied taxes on the Bunyaha and shopkeepers. They were here also joined ' by Azaud Khan of Kharan. It was at this crisis that, on the request of the Vakeel of the Khan residing at Jacobabad, Lieutenant Macauley (now Major) was despatched by Major (now Sir William) Merewether to Khelat. On his arrival at the top of the Moolla Pass he was met by a messenger of the rebel Chiefs, forwarding a petition to the British Government. This messenger Lieutenant Macauley ' sent back with an answer that he would . neither receive letters from, nor hold communication with men in arms against their King, and if they wished him to receive their petition, it must coir.e '■ through the Khan. Lieutenant Macauley then proceeded to Khelat and £ ' joined the Khan ; the rebel Chiefs and their retainers dispersing.' Affairs were at this stage when I joined His Highness in November 1S57. The Chiefs not held to be 1 ^ tl ' at 1 f 0nl,ed a hi S h OP in 'O n of His rebels by British Officers on the Ilig-hness. I had much conversation with Lieutenant dpot. ® Macauley, and requested His Highness to introduce( 18 ) mo to the rebel Chiefs. Lieutenant Macauley appears to think that then no alternative hut to have acted as they had done, that they were most respectful, and pointed out that none of their lives would be safe, nor could the country even be quiet, if the young Khan were to retain such advisers as Gool Mahomed and Gungaram. Sir Henry Green now turned his attention to the best mode of ridding Sir Henry Green's report of Ith the Khan of the muiderer Gool iVEahotned, and (rllll- December 1858. ram, as his chief advisers, and it was ultimately arranged that the Khan should proceed to meet the Commissioner, Mr. Frere, who at this time (December 1857) was at Jacobabad. Paras. 40 to 53 of Mr. (now Sir Bartle) Frere's letter to the Bombay n . . , r v . Government No. G4 of 1858, dated 19th Febru- The Commissioner, Mr. Frere s, . ' report to Government, February ary, gives a complete account of all that took place 1858. at Jacobabad on that occasion. Notwithstanding the arrangements then made, viz: the exclusion of Febmary 1858 Darogah Gool Mahomed and Gungaram, and the selection of Shagassee Wullee Mahomed for the post of Wuzzeer which he now holds, Sir Henry Green after his return to the Khans Mahomed was not in- cam P at 0undava says ' soon after my return,! stalled regularly for many perceived that the former evil influence was at months. . i i t i work again, and that little advice of mine was at tended to, and that the Khan had taken a personal dislike to Wullee Mahomed.' By the 27th April (1858) the heat at Gundava became very great, and a move to Khelat was commenced by the Khan, the Political Agent march- Tlie Chief Sirdar of Beloo- ing to Chutter. That evenino- Sirdar Tai Maho- chistan. , 1 i • p i . med, the chiet of Jalawan, who was in rebellion against the Khan for the reason before stated, called upon Sir Henry, and after some conversation said ' if order be not restored in the country, and the rights of the Chiefs of Beloochistan attended to, harm will come to '• you. I asked if he dared to threaten me, a servant of the British Govern ment, and told him that he had better lower his tone and leo.ve my tent before harm came to himself. He immediately apologised, saying he was &lt;c a rough mountaineer and meant nothing wrong.' Sir Henry then proceeded towards Khelat, and the Khan joined him at Sorab on the 13th May. His Highness begged, through Shagassee Wullee Mahomed, that ho might be helped in his difficulties, and Sir Henry then addiessed Sirdars Paj Mahomed and Moolla Mahomed, reminding them that Khoodadad Khan was their legitimate Sovereign, and advising them to tender their allegiance and be true to him. The Sirdars replied that, notwithstanding their wrongs and the treache rous treatment they had received in the previous September, they would follow( 19 ) Sir Henry's advice, and at once manifested their loyalty by proceeding against some refractory Chiefs in Mekran, whom they punished and brought to Khelat to be disposed of by the Khan's Government. Notwithstanding this obedient conduct on their part, as desired by the Political Agent, the Khanazad Darogah Gool Mahomed, who had reasserted his intiuence over the young Khan, succeeded in sowing the seeds of discord between him and his Chiefs. On this subject, Sir Henry says « it was clear to me that I stood on ' most treacherous ground ; that while a pretender to the throne was close to the Capital, and also that the Khan was disliked by his Chiefs on account of ' Gool Mahomed, that my proceedings would be most closely and zealously watched by the Sirdars, the real strength of the country, and that I must be ' mcst careful neither to do injustice to them, by siding with the Khan, or to ' him, by taking part with the Chiefs against him.' Associated with Gool Mahomed was a man by name Shere Khan, holding the position of Commandant of the Khan's Infantry regiment, 'a Punjab Mus sulman by birth, and who formerly served in the 4th Punjab Infantry, from ' which he was dismissed in disgrace, and then proceeded to Candahar, taking The character of Shere Khan, ' 6ervic e there, and again dismissed. He then the leader of the mercenary ' came into the service of late Nusseer Khan Toops. « i i i • i • t • • who kept him at his distance in his proper posi- ' tion. His men were composed of about 100 scoundrels of sorts, deserters from our Belooch Regiments, Pathans and Affghans, with men from all parts ot Central Asia. The Darogah saw that these men were regularly paid and ' cared for, they were permitted uncontrolled license, and were a scourge to — ' O ' the country around.' ' These men were ready to commit any crime and, if necessary, had mere- ' ly to proceed across the Prontier to Affghanistan to Khelat men are n0W in POWer at ' esca P e the consequences. The Darogah's two sons, ' Atta Mahomed and Mahomed Ali, of course sup- t£ ported their father.'' H &lt;£ Reports now began to spread of something desperate being about to be c&lt; undertaken by the Darogah. I was warned to be careful. I could see that my ' men were uneasy. I observed that when I went up to the Citadel to visit the {&lt; Khan, that if I were five minutes later than usual in returninof, the men of ' o 7 '■ my escort were assembled in clusters about my tent, and that as soon as they ' saw me returning, they dispersed.' ' The Darogah had some time before sent me a plate of Apricots, but I was ' advised not to touch them, and did not. Shere Khan, the Commandant of the Khan's Pathan Infantry, I had desired never to be allowed to enter ' my Camp.'( 20 ) ' Some few days afcerwards I was informed that Shere Klian, the Com- cc mandant of Infantry, had been seen coming at midnight to the lines of mv ' escort for the purpose, as I ascertained, of trying to tamper with the men ' of the Sind Horse/' * * 'The Chiefs of Beloochistan were now within a couple of marches (on their ' return fromMekran referred to above), and I strongly advised the Khan now ' that they had proved their fidelity in his service beyond a doubt, to receive ' them worthily ; to reward them; and to forget that they had ever been in ' rebellion against him. ' ' On their arrival I complimented them on their fidelity to the Khan, and Treatment of the chiefs by the 'before him presented the principal Chiefs with T'ohticul Agent, ' slight presents to show my appreciation of their ' services. This took place with the sanction of, and in presence of, the Khan. ' 1 had hoped that he would follow my example, but in this I regret to ' say I was disappointed. The Chiefs however The treatment bv the Khan. , , , n . i ,111 r i^r ' behaved very well, they thanked me tor what 1 was ' trying to do for them, kc., &amp;c.' ' Generally from the Ciilefs of Beloochistan T have received the greatest ' assistance, in fact had it not been so, it would have been impossible to have ' kept the country quiet. The Chiefs are a wild hot-headed race, but 1 found &lt;£ that patiently reasoning with them had its full eliect.' In addition to the above fact, which show the present ruler of Khelat and his noble Chiefs in their true colors respectively, the No. 217 of 1858, 21st Mav. . . „ -n/f-r' ' i. j. following extract irom Mr. ^ re res report to uo- vernment, as per margin, is prophetic of all that has since occurred up to the present time. ' With regard to the Khan s character, I fear there can be little doubt ' that it is unpromising in the extreme. Not that lie is without some good ' traits, probably in an inferior position as the petty Chief of half a dozen Hc Villages he might pass through life unnoticed and unblamed, but even Major ' Green who would gladly have taken the most favorable view of his character, ' is drawn to the conclusion that he is mean and low minded ; wanting in ' courage and openness, and totally destitute of that frankness and spirit &lt;£ which are the first requisites in the ruler of so many half wild tribes, and ' which would, if he possessed them, atone for a multitude of grave faults. ' I would not have reiterated my opinion on this subject, were it not ' necessary to explain one of the great difficulties The remainder of this para is ^ • • i i i c moat important and sound. ec ot Major Ore en s position, and the hopelessness or Air T \f ' our getting from His Highness in return for all that we do for him, any, but negative results.( 21 ) In 1858, Sir Henry Green described his policy as follows :—' During the No. 712 Of 1858, dated 29th ' time I have been in the country, my policy has December. « ^ 0 , distinctly side with neither party, but to ' faithfully and scrupulously act for what I considered the good of the whole. ' To allow myself to be biassed by no party feeling, or to enter into or acknow- ' ledire any intrigue.' o o Again, at tlie end of May,. Mr. Frere wrote ' my own impression is that tt t &gt;. tc x n- ' 0Lir fi rs t object should be to set ourself right with H. R frere Lsq. to Govern- J 0 ment No. 232, of 3ist May the Chiefs ofBeloochistan, and let them see that it ' is- no part of our wish or policy to support a bad or deservedly unpopular ruler.' * * * * {t I need not remark that when left to themselves they have a very sum- ' mary way of correcting mis-government.' * * ' But my hope of His Highness voluntarily following the good advice- ' given him by Major Green has daily diminished, and though it is even less &lt;c practicable now than it was six months ago to withdraw our influence which alone preserves some kind of order ; and even more impolitic to leave the ' coast clear for Azaud Khan and his Persian allies, I am convinced that our ' first care ought to be to obtain some assurance before we further,support ' the Khan, that his future Government shall be such as to give reasonable ' satisfaction to his Chiefs and subjects.' After proposing to assemble the Chiefs, Mr. Frere would point out to all in his His Highness' presence 4&lt; that we have supported His Highness as the ' lawful heir to the throne, deliberately recognised as such at his accession by ' all the great Chiefs, and that our only object in all we have done has been ' the peace and good government of Beloochistan ; that we are prepared further ' to support His Highness if we have only reasonable ground for hoping that 4 he will justify our support by governing well, according to Belooeh customs ; ' and I would let the Khan and his Chiefs clearly understand that we will not '•'again be deluded by promises of reformation, to be evaded as soon as the ' crisis has passed.' Lord Elphinstones' Government replied to-the above letter in para. 3, &amp;c., as follows :—The Right Honorable the Governor in 1858' 22r)0 ' 0f 14th Janua17 Council is of opinion, and he believes that it is in accordance with that of the Government of India, and of the Home Authorities, that we should interfere as little as possible cc in the concerns of our Belooch and Affghan neighbours,, and that we are tc more likely to acquire the influence over them which we wish to possess, if ' we leave them to settle their domestic affairs to their own liking.' (4.) ' In the present case the Bight Honorable the Governor in Council ' fears that we may be going further than we ought in supporting a Iluler who ' does not appear to possess the respect of his subjects, and 1 am desired toc£ state that His Lordship in Council fully agrees with the remark of your '• letter of the 31st May, that our first object should be to set ourselves right il with the Chiefs of Beloochistan, and let them see that it is no part of our &lt;c work or policy to support a bad or deservedly unpopular Ruler.' (9.) 'If Khoodadad Khan is the worthless man that he is rcpre- ' sen ted, the Right Honorable the Governor in Council considers that the ' sooner we leave him to his fate, the better, but I am desired to request that ' you will have the goodness to instruct Major Green to make a last effort ' to rouse him to a sense of his duty, and if this fails, that you will instruct ' Major Green to return to Jacobabad. The Right Honorable the Governor &lt;£ in Council cannot think that we should be justified, even in the event of ' the Khan's promising reformation, in authorising Major Green to take any tc measures which seem to him necessary to defend Khelat, and to defeat the ' designs of the rebels. His Lordship in Council considers that this would ' be in fact identifying ourselves with the cause of Khoodadad Khan, and ' this Government I am desired to state is not prepared to recommend such a measure to the Government of India.' (Part of para 11.) ' The Right Honorable the Governor in Council con- siders that unless Major Green can succeed in the very unpromising task of ' bringing the young Khan to a sense of his duty, and of rallying the great ' body of his Chiefs around him, the sooner Major Green leaves him the ' better.' In March 1S59 Sir Henry Green proceeded with the Khan on his expedition into the Murree Hills, and in April dated 14th f J uu ^ isbq 0 ' ^ ^ again proceeded via the Bolan Pass to Quetta and Moostung, at which last place he arrived at the middle of July 1859. ' During my stay at Kanar I had several Interviews with Sirdar Moolla ' Mahomed, who is the principal Chief of Beloochis- Sirdar Moolla Mohomed. . . tan, and a most intelligent young man. He quite ' agreed with me as to the necessity for the Khan's going to Mekran, stating ' that unless he did so, the whole of that country would fall into the hands ' of his enemies.' The report then goes on to show that, owing to the influence of a Kandahar Vukeel, and some of those by whom the Khan was surrounded, the project of going to Mekran was thwarted, as they ' from selfish and inter- ' ested motives were greatly opposed to British influence being exerted over ' the Khan.' ' Nothing therefore was done until the winter had set in, when His ' Highness informed me that the whole of his Chiefs had refused either to ' accompany him, or furnish their contingents, and begged me to assist him.'( 23 ) ' Sir Henry Green explained to Sirdar Taj Mahomed, the Chief of Jala- ' wan, what was required, and he readily offered every assistance ; at the same ' time explaining that from the Khan's conduct to the Chiefs and people, since ' his receiving the Khanate, he could expect no hope for better assistance from ' them.' Both Sirdar Taj Mahomed and Sirdar Moolla Mahomed obeyed Sir H. Green's summons, and under their help the expedition was carried out- (Para 35). ' On our return to Khelat, I seriously pointed out to llis ' Highness the absolute necessity of his earnestly turning his attention to the &lt;c affairs of his country, and that he must no longer look to me for assistance ' beyond advice. I only wish I could hold out hopes that he would rule his ' country as it ought to be ruled.' The following is an extract from the letter which Sir H. Green wrote to His Highness on this occasion :— Khelat, Gth April 1860. AJter compliments, In the year 1854 the late GeneralJacob, in the name of the British Govern ment, made a Treaty with your brother, by which he was to receive for the exemp tion of certain transit dues, and for securing the safety of the roads and mer chants travelling through your dominions to the British Frontier, the yearly sum of llupees 50,000. When I arrived in your country, I soon perceived that this sum of money was the cause of much discontent amongst your Chiefs, who believed that they had a right to a certain share of it. After your return from the Murree campaign, I read the Treaty to you and the principal Chiefs, and pointed out that this money was solely for your use, and that they had no claim to any part of it. I however wrote to the British Government to place another llupees 50,000 at my disposal. This was done, and I had hoped that if I also placed this sum at your disposal, you would see the necessity of being generous towards your Chiefs, and to come to some satisfactory arrangement with them, without the necessity of my bringing the matter to your notice. You are in the position of a father of a family, and as you prosper and grow rich, so your family hope to share a portion of your riches ; but in this respect you appear to think differently, and that however rich you may become, your people must remain poor and hungry. I have pointed out to you this state of your country. I will now state what steps I consider necessary to remedy the pre sent evils. You are aware that it has been the custom for ages in your country for a register to be kept, in which the name, position, and wages of each Chief is distinctly laid down. This book, with many others, was destroyed when Khelat was taken by a British Force. I now propose that another should be written out, so that each Chief may know the exact position and account of wages, and to assist you in carrying this into effect, I am prepared to place at your disposal from the extra Rupees 50,000 allowed by my Government what ever sum may be deemed requisite for the purpose. This I hope will put an end to the bickering and trouble caused by your Chief in making constant( 2^ ) claims for wages. Whatever remains I will either present to you or dispose as I consider best for your welfare and that of your countryThe Us. 50,000 which you receive by Treaty, you will continue to- receive, provided you carry into effect the articles of that Treaty, the substance of which are that the roads between Shawl and the British Frontier, both via the Bolan and Khelat, bo kept clear and safe for traffic, and tliat only the taxes laid down in that Treaty be allowed to be exacted from merchants. In arranging the wages for your Chiefs, I would recommend the following stipulation being agreed to i— 1st. That any Chief misconducting himself should, after proper enquiry, forfeit the amount of his wages and be otherwise punished as may be deemed suited to his crime. 2nd. That on their services being required, the wages of those not attend ing should be forfeited for the year and divided amongst those who do. I would further recommend that you firmly establish Shagassee Wullee Ma homed as your Wuzzeer, making him the usual present on the occasion ; place the collection of your revenues in his handstand in every way assist him in supporting your authority. 3.rd. That you daily, or not less than three times during the week, sit in open Durbar for the purpose of listening to, and settling, disputes amongst your subjects and dispensing justice. If you think fit to keep up a small force of regular sepoys as a guard of honor to enforce your orders, I see no objection, always bearing in mind that a force of this kind requires the strictest discipline, otherwise it merely becomes, a tool for oppression. You should place o-ver this force a respectable man, and not the disrepu table person who has been dismissed in disgrace from, the service of the British Government. I would advise this force to consist of— 29 Native Commissioned, Non-Commissioned Rank and File of Artillery. 100 Cavalry. 267 Infantry^ Total 39G. Should you consider the above arrangements for your benefit, I would advise that you at once proceed to carry them into effect. Should you consider otherwise, it will then be unnecessary for me to solicit from the British Go.- vernment the extra Rupees 50,,000.( 25 ) A British Officer is not placed in my position roerely for the purpose of protecting you against injury from your own subjects, caused by your own misgovernment. The friendship of one individual is of little service to the British Government, but that of a contented and well governed country on its Frontier is of the utmost service. * * * * (Signed) Henry Green, In March 1861, Major (now Sir William) Merewether wrote to the Officer Commanding in Sind, para. 9—' Having a friendly power steadily growing ' strong next to us, admits of this Frontier and Upper Sind being held by a u weak Brigade, instead of a Division being required. If that power become ' hostile to us, or unmanageable from internal dissensions, we should have to ' defend the Western Frontier of Sind, not against a few hundred Belooch ' robbers as is sometimes supposed, but against thousands of most hardy and ' determined enemies, viz. the whole Brahoee nation. And again, when they ' by these quarrels and divisions had fallen to pieces, the Affghans would only too readily take advantage of their weakness to possess themselves of their &lt;£ country.' In 1861 Sir Henry Green went on leave,, and Captain Dickinson replaced him on the 21st of May that year ; the following are extracts from Captain Dickinson's report dated 23rd January 18G2. On the 18th June, having made the 3rd march within the Moolla Pass, I received intelligence that Sirdar Taj Mahomed Zehree, the Chief of Jhalawan, had assembled his tribe and was intending to plunder the country. The character of this- Chieftain, the second in rank in Beloochistan, h&amp;d been described to me by Major Green as hasty, headstrong, and inclined to intrigue ; he was one of the Sirdars who rebelled against the Khan shortly after his accession, and has never since been on very good terms with the Ruler, but the Khan having demanded his daughter in marriage, it was hoped that by means of this alliance a more happy feeling might be induced. This expecta tion was however defeated by the act of His Highness, who disregarding his betrothal immediately after his return to the hills, and during the short period that he was separated from the influence of the Political Agent, married the widow of his brother, the late Xusseer Khan who, although the sister, is inimical to the Jhalawan Sirdar, This act on the part of His Highness was regarded by the Brahoee tribes as dishonorable and insulting, and several of the Chiefs were prepared to take up the quarrel of their compier ; and even the Khans personal adherents admitted that their master had by such an act given deep reason for resentment. On the 20th June I received a letter from the Khan's brother-in-law, Sirdar Syud Khan, informing me that the Jhalawan Attempt to embroil us with nw r • u i rv • . • .l the Chiefs. Chief was in revolt, and offering to assist me with the force at his disposal. I declined his offer, and( 2G ) requested that such might not be repeated, as I considered it likely to aggra vate a matter already sufficiently serious. On the 21st a messenger from Taj Mahomed arrived in my camp bearing apologies from his master for not personally meeting me, which he was unable to do, in consequence of the assembly of the tribes. On the following day, I received a letter from the Sirdar, a translation of which is appended. On arrival at Khelat on the 2nd July, I visited His Highness the Khan, and he returned the ceremony on the following day. -On the latter occasion I caused Sirdar Taj Mahomed's letter to be read to him. He candidly acknow ledged that he had deeply injured the Sirdar, and said that his fate caused him to do so, and with the view of avoiding discussion, he constantly harped on the injury which lie considered himself to have received in some of his grain having been plundered by the Sirdar's followers. Ultimately, His Highness agreed to concur in any measure I might propose, after consultation with the Wuzzeer and Sirdar Moolla Mahomed, the Chief of Sarawan. Subsequent enquiry convinced me that His Highness' complaints regarding the injury done his granaries by the Sirdar's followers were greatly and designedly exaggerated. On the 5th July I had an interview with the Wuzzeer and the Eysanee Chief, The former is the Khan's best and most trustworthy servant, he said that he deeply deplored the rash step his master had taken. Sirdar Moolla Mahomed, the Sarawan Sirdar, also said that so deeply did he feel that his brother Chief had been deeply injured, that he felt quite prepared to side with him. After much discussion it was determined that the Chief, accompanied by the Akhoond and another officer, should proceed to the Jhala- wan Sirdar and try to adjust matters amicably. They did so ; the assembly of the Zuhree tribe was broken up, and Taj Mahomed returned to his village, where he has since quietly remained. It cannot however be disguised that a feeling of hatred still exists on the part of His Highness towards the Sirdar, and he openly professes vindic- tiveness to an extent perhaps incredible to one unacquainted with his charac- This was about six months ter ) and so lately as the day before yesterday, he declared to me that, were it not for English restraint, he should immediately carry matters to extremity, and, to quote his own words, ' By the assistance of God and the Frophet, he would quietly extermi- The threat was fulfilled after- nate an enemy whoyi he would trace even though waids - they were to meet before the judgment seat of their Creator.''» ( 27 ) The Sirdar likewise has not forgotten the injury ; his letters display a captious and querulous spirit, and so great is his resentment that, when His Highness on his inarch down to Cutchee in November last encamped for several days in the vicinity of Zubree, he could be induced by neither persuasion or advice to pay his respects to the Khan, and now only remains quiet in deference to the Political Agent. Report No. 60, dated 29^ January 1863. (5.) The relations which have existed between the Government of His Highness the Khan of Khelat, and that of the British, have been of the same v cordial nature as heretofore, every effort has been made by him to meet the wishes in all subjects, and more particularly with regard to the Electric Tele graph line now in course of construction through his dominions on the coast of Mekran ; at the same time I regret to be compelled to state that his relations with his Chiefs still remain in an unsatisfactory state, and open rebellion is with difficulty prevented by the presence of a British Officer at his Court, and the personal influence exerted by him over the Chiefs and people. Much of the ill-feeling towards the Khan is doubtless caused by his capricious, unstable character, but his Chiefs by the unreasonableness of their demands, and in solence of their conduct towards him, render any permanent settlement of their differences most difficult; his power over them is slight, and although their lands are held by feudal tenure, any attempt made by His Highness to enforce even the extradition of a culprit, leads to their banding together and defying his authority. The above has been for years the state of the country ; and the position of the Political Agent at the Court of Khelat, situated beyond the British border amongst barren mountains, and surrounded by so many elements of discord, is a most difficult one; he stands between Iseutrality of the Agent. i i • ^ i i r-n . the Khan and his feudal Chiefs, both parties look to him to listen to and redress their grievances, and he must keep a just equili brium between the two parties, and to his personal influences gained by his reputation amongst those semi-barbarian tribes for courage, unscrupulous good faith, and justice, much of the tranquillity of this part of the British border depends. I can with pleasure, however, state that the individual character of an Englishman stands so high amongst these wild races, that the life and property of a single officer amongst them is safer than in the most civilized countries in Europe. Within the last few months an European Merchant proceeded from our border with several camel loads of valuable silks across &gt; Cutchee and through the Gundava Pass to Khelat, he was totally without any guard, and merely held a letter from the Political Officer on the Erontier to the Khan, and one or two Chiefs, through whose country he would pass ; he met throughout with the greatest civility and kindness, sold his merchandize, and returned through the whole length of Beloochistan to Kurrachee, at the time there was no Political Officer residing at Khelat. Report No. 19, dated kth Januai-y 1864. (8.) My great object has been apparently to interfere as little as possible in the affairs of the Khelat State, and to leave every thing in the hands of the( 28 ) Chiefs, at the same time using all my personal influence to guide them in a right course, and maintain peace. I felt and knew that to oppose the popular will at the commencement of the rebellion would have at once placed the British Government in an antagonistic position to the whole of the Belooch nation, I therefore temporarily withdrew the Political Agent from Khelat. (9.) During the past month an emissary from the Candahar Chief arrived at Khelat, and proposed to the present Khan support, on condition that he should makeover the valley of Shawl (Quetta) and Mustoong, as well as the town of Dadur, to the Affghan nation. This would have given them entire command of the Bolan Pass. The Brahoee Chiefs at once refused their consent to such propositions, and the Affghan returned to Candahar. (10.) It is with great satisfaction that I have to report the great assistance that I have met with from the principal and most influential Chiefs in Beloo- The present Khan chistan, as well as from Meer Khoodadad Khan, the deposed Prince. This young man has steadily refused all assistance from Poreign powers, and on my pointing out to him that his attempting to maintain a hopeless position with a few followers, would be hable to create disorder on the Frontier border, he at once dismissed his retainers, and cheerfully accepted a place of residence close to the British Frontier, and has never failed to assist me with any influence he may still retain to maintain peace. Shere Dil Khan, who was elected Khan, and who has since his election resided in the strong fortress of Khelat, but with whom I have as yet declined to hold communication, at once left his strong position, on hearing that I had expressed a wish to see him.

(2.) \ou are fully aware that almost from the date of the accession of His Highness Khoodadad Khan, to the throne of Khelat, constant quarrels and dissensions have taken place between himself and the Chiefs of Beloochistan. (3.) The cause of these quarrels may be traced in a great measure to the Khan himself who, relying on foreign support and The present Khan and the ,1 . oit . ^ o ni 1 , origin of his quarrel with Taj the fidelity of a few so-called regular troops, had ^1 Jomed who went mto rebel- invariably treated the Chiefs of the country with neglect, almost amounting to contempt, and ou( 29 ) one occasion committed a very great insult on the family of the powerful Jala- wan Sirdar, Taj Mahomed, who would have avenged it at the time, had not the influence of the English Officer resident at Khelat prevented him ; but the feeling of revenge lias never left him, and to this I mainly attribute the disturbance which occurred at the commencement of the year 18G8. (4.) I must here recall to your remembrance the incessant remonstrances of yourself, whilst Political Agent to His Highness, both verbally and in wri ting, as to his bearing towards the Chiefs of the country, and your constant warnings of the catastrophe which, did he not change his conduct towards them, would ultimately lose him the throne. (10.) At the end of April 18G3, having recovered from his wound, Kho- dadad Khan moved through the Gundava Pass to Kozdar, and there- collected a small force from amongst the Southern tribes, and in June advanced towards Khelat ; was deserted by the greater portion of the army when within two Sirdar MooQa Mahomed, the arches of the place, and finally reached the Mus- benefactor of the present Khan toong valley, where he was hospitably received and in his adversity.. i • 'i i /&gt; treated, with the lew adherants stdl with him, by Sirdar Moolla Mahomed, the principal Chief of Beloochistan, under whose guidance the revolution was, and is still, progressing. (11.) In November last Khoodadad Khan, accompanied by Sirdar Moolla Mahomed, and a few adherents, arrived in Cutchee, and he has since been resi ding at Xusseerabad, a small village in His Highness' territories, distant about 10 miles from Jacobabad. (16.) There now remains to show the state of the country at the present time. Although the most influential Chiefs- and pJ^YtheUonfed^'' 6 88 Tribes adhere steadil y ^ Shere Dil Khan, there exist a small party who still acknowledge the deposed Prince Khodadad Khan as the proper ruler of the country ; it has therefore been proposed by the Chiefs, with the view of finally settling and securing the peace of the country, that there shall be a Conference held, and that each Chief shall give his vote and opinion, and should the majority shew themselves in favor of Shere Dil Khan, he should be elected accordingly. o j (17.) I have now the honor to bring to your notice the loyalty towards the British Government which has characterized the proceedings of all parties in Beloochistan, from the time Khodadad Khan w T as wounded in March last to the instant of his arrival, under the care of Sirdar Moolla Mahomed, at your camp at Shahpoor in November, and to the deference shewn to the wishes of (irovernment in obtaining your concurrence previous to his taking up a posi tion so near the British Frontier. You are already aware that, although the \ I Article of the Treaty between the British Government and Khelat has been for some months suspended on the part of the former, no instance has( 30 ) occurred or attempt made to use this fact, as an excuse for departing- from the original terms of the Treaty ; and by increasing the Vide letter in Political De- _ 0 . . . ^ partment No. 2304, dated 22iad transit dues on merchandize passing through the ' ,ul - v 1M, ■ 5 country to India, to raise the revenue to the same amount as it was previous to the Treaty being entered into, and thus save the country from the state of bankruptcy to which the late disturbances have almost reduced it.

Report JSo. 30, dated Januanj 1866. 4. His Highness the Khan of Kelat has been employed during the year in settling the affaiis of his country after the confusion of the year 1863-64, and for this purpose, he remained during the past cold season at Kelat. An attempt to create disturbances was made in July by the Jam of Beyla and Nooroodeen, the Chief of the powerful Mingul Tribe, but the forces were met by those of His Highness the Khan, near Kozdar in Jalawan, and totally defeated ; both the Jam and Nooroodeen were captured in the retreat, and have since resided under surveillance at Kelat. Report I'iih April 1868 from Sir Henry Green, 1. I have the honor to submit a report of the political state of the Sind Prontier and adjoining countries for the year 1867-68. 2. As reported by me, in my letter under date the 1st Novemer 1867, No. 1407, disturbances broke out in Beloochistan in October last, caused by the return of Sirdar Moolla Mahomed, the Eysanee Chief, to the country, from Candahar, where he had been residing in exile since his flight from Beloochis tan in 186.3. The object of his return was, there can be little - doubt, to cause a rebellion in the country, and on his presence being known, he was joined by three of the minor Chiefs, by name Adam Khan, Bungulzye, Aladeena Koord, and Mahomed Khan Lehree, with about 200 of their immediate follow ers ; they were however met by His Highness the Khan with most energetic measures, he having at once despatched Shagassee Wullee Mahomed with the small regular force which His Highness has at his disposal, and the differ ent tribes as they were collected. The Shagassee at once attacked and dis persed the rebels wherever assembled, and after a few efforts to maintain their( 31 ) position in which they were not joined by the people of the country, they fled for refuge to the Murree Tribe, begging from them an asylum and assistance ; the former was afforded according to the ideas of honor entertained by all semi-barbarians, but all assistance in prosecuting these rebellious intentions was refused. 3. During the month of January last, T proceeded patrolling, accompa nied by the 2nd Sind IXorse^ and skirted the Murree mountains, visiting the province of Cutch-Gundava in the territory of His Highness the Khan of Kelat ; while there, I received a message from Sirdar Moolla Mahomed and the Chiefs who were with him, begging me to intercede in their behalf with their master the Ivhan, and to allow them in the meantime to reside near the British Frontier, or in any place that I might name. I however declined to interfere in any way between them and His Highness, except at the latter's loquest, in which case both parties must agree to abide by mv decision, they on their part consented to do so. I then wrote to His Highness the Khan who was at Kelat, pointing out that these Chiefs had received severe and well- merited punishment at his hands, and suggesting that it would be for his benefit and for the well-being of his country, if they were forgiven and allowed to return to their homes. In due time I received a reply from His Highness, sjiying, that he placed everything m my hands, and that he would agree to any arrangement I might suggest. I then informed the Sirdars that they were at liberty to reside at Seebee, the N. E. corner of Outch Gundava, until I had leisure to meet them j and at the same time I informed the Shagassee that thev were not to be molested, on which he dismissed the assembled tribes to their homes. This occurred in February last, and I felt confidant that no attempt at disturbances would be made by the Chiefs, until I could attend to their business. 9. On my return to Jacobabad on the above date, I sent a messenger to Shagassee Wullee Mahomed, His Highness the Khan's Wuzzeer, or principal adviser, as also to Sirdar Moolla Mahomed, requesting their attendance on the 10th of the month. I may here mention that w r ith both these individuals I had become intimately acquainted during a residence of four years as Political Agent in Beloochistan. The family of the Shagassee Wullee Mahomed had held from time immemorial confidential posts near the Khan of Kelat, and his brother Noor Mahomed had died sword in hand by the side of his master Mehrab Khan at the storming of Kelat by the British in 1839, an act since proved to have been of questionable justice, while the females of his family were destroyed at the same time according to Belooch custom, to prevent them from falling into the hands of the victors. He himself escaped from the Citadel in charge of the son of Mehrab Khan, the late Khan and brother of the present one, and was the principal instigator and actor in the rebellion which dethroned the Khan-Sha-Newaz, elected by the British Government after the death of Mehrab Khan, and caused the election of Meer Nusseer Khan and death of the Political Agent, Lieutenant Loveday. Shagassee Wullee Mahomed( 32 ) durinoe tlie many years in which I have been acquainted with him, has never failed to offer the best advice to His Highness the Khan, in all matters, and to his firmness and loyalty towards the British Government, and influence amongst the Chiefs and people of Beloochistan, I mainly ascribe the peace which prevailed on the Sind Frontier during the worst period of the Indian rebellion, and when the Khan, then a boy of 15. years, was being urged by Persian and Affghan intrigue to side against the British power and create disorder on its frontier. 10. Sirdar Moolla Mahomed, the Chief of Sara wan, and the head of the llysanee Tribe of Brahooees, fled in 1865 from Beloochistan to Candahar, owing to his implication in a plot, the object of which was the assassination of the present Khan, and in which the late Sirdar Taj Mahomed was the Chief insti gator; this latter Chief, the most powerful in Beloochistan had, on a former occasion in 1862, more suscessfully led a rebellion against his master, in which the latter was severely wounded by his cousin Share Dil Khan, who was elect ed Khan, and his victim sought refuge close to the British border; the usurper did not long retain his position after. For a time being made the tool of the Chiefs who plundered Kelat, he was murdered in the Gundava Pass by some men of the Zehree tribe, of which Sirdar Taj Mahomed was the Chief, and who at the time was close by, being beyond a doubt again the prime mover. 11. The present Khan then again resumed his legitimate position, but it may well be understood that he placed little confidence in his Chiefs, more particularly in Sirdar Moolla Mahomed and Taj Mahomed. As before stated, these two Chiefs again leagued against him, but this time he was beforehand with them, and the Zehree Chief was seized and confined, whilst the Chief now under notice fled to Candahar. These occurrences happened in the month of February 1865, and from that date up to the time of the events now under report, Beloochistan enjoyed a period of profound peace. 12. In August 1867 Taj Mahomed died at Kelat while in confinement, and reports were spread of his having been assassinated at a feast, but these were utterly false ; and other means were employed to cause the death of the Chief my most minute enquiries have failed to eclucidatc. One thing is how ever beyond a doubt, that a more desperate intrigue or a greater traitor did not exist in any native Court in Asia, and so long as he remained at large. His Highness the Khan's position could never have been sale. 13. As reported in the month of November last, Sirdar Moolla Maho med returned from Candahar, with the view of again creating a rebellion ; but his former companion was no longer ready to aid him, and in the mean time His Highness the Khan had done everything in his power to strengthen his position. I knew of this Chiefs intentions, and having a regard for him, which I had gained from frequent intercourse on sporting excursions in ^ie Belooch mountains, where I had on many occasions partaken of his hospitality, T warnedhim to desist from Lis intention; the result of his not doing so have been shown in my 2nd para. 14. At the appointed date, the Wuzzeer and Chief attended at Jacobabad, each escorted by a small party of retainers, and after hearing the complaints of both parties, I was enabled so to adjust the differences as to remove all chance Sirdar Moolla Mahomed went of a renewal of hostilities between His Highness to Seebee and waite.l there until and his Chiefs, and on the return of the former to the time for making the perma- j i i • nent arrangement here referred the plains next winter, a more permanent arrange- to, arrived. . i ment can be made. Sir Henry Green was succeeded as Political Superintendent on the fron tier of Upper Sind by Colonel Phayre, who arrived there in the month of August 1868. On the 14th October, it was report ed that the Khan of Kelat, whom the Political Superintendent had expressed a wish to meet in Cutchee for the pur- With the Jam of Beyla on the.point pose of discussing the affairs of the of again rebelling he could not well Khanate, would not move down from do so.

W. L. M. On the 8th February,'in the first instance under instructions received by telegram from Bombay, but not gazetted till March. lie however entered on the duties in February. Captain Harrison had served on the Frontier for 11 years, and having been at Kelat with Sir Henry Green, was already personally acquainted with the Khan and some of the Chiefs. W. L. M. ' It is certainly scarcely to be won- ' dred at that, when in addition to the ' deprivation of landed property, ahso- ' lute want of the nesessaries of life ' affects men of rank and influence ' like Sirdar Moolla Mahomed, and ' others, some such effect to relieve ' themselves as that hinted at by the ' Vakeel, should develop itself.' Captain Harrison was appointed Political Agent at Kelat in March 18G9. One of the first matters ho was requested to undertake being to re concile Sirdar Moolla Mahomed, the Jam, Noordeen, and others, with the Khan. The Jam and Noordeen had been out in rebellion at the end of 18G8, but Sirdar Moolla Mahomed had not join ed them under promises from me that, if he remained quiet in his place of exile at Seebee until Captain Har rison could present him at Kelat, his case would be represented in a proper manner. No specific causes of grievance had ever been elicited from any of the Chiefs ; one of the first measures there fore which I adopted was to write down everything as expressed in the following letter to Sir W m . Mere- wether, dated 23rd March 1869. ' I received your telegram regard- infj Sirdar Moolla Ma- Colonel Phayres 0 letter of 23rd homed and his follow ers late last nio-ht.' ' My first plan regarding him wns that lie should go to Kelat with35 ) Harrison, but as Harrison did net appear to like that, it was abandoned. I then proposed the same plan that you now suggest, viz. that he should to go Kelat direct, arriving a few days after Harrison.' To this, Moolla Mahomed replied that he would do just as I might de cide, but that as this is a matter that nearly concerns the whole of the Bra- liooe Chiefs and people, whose rights and very means of livelihood are at stake, he wished to join the Council of the Confederacy which was to meet In Jhalawan, to draw up a petition to the Khan representing all they had to say.'' ' I replied to Moolla Mahomed that according to the original and proper organisation of the Kelat State, the assembly of a Council of Chiefs was unobjectionable, and that under all the circumstances of the case, I would not object to his going, as he wished to do so ; but I told him, and also wrote to the Jam of Beyla, that a respectful representation to the Khan of all reasonable grievances would meet with support from the Political Agent, Captain Harrison, but that violent measures would injure their cause.' ' Sirdar Moolla Mahomed quite as sented to this ; he said moreover that were he not to go, it would place him in a most awkward predicament with all his own people, inasmuch as they would conclude that he had secretly abandoned their cause under promises from us.'( 36 ) Note hy Colonel Note hy Sir JF.

' Xow as we have given him nothing whatever for all his seivices, and as he and his people have gone through an immense amount of actual want du ring the past 2 years, and remained silent by our advice, I did not feel authorised under our present policy of non-interference, to throw the apple of discord between him and his own people.'' Military Confederacy can scarcely be correctly applied to the Khanate of Kelat, no more than to England in the time of The Khan is clearly a Sovereign, and the Chiefs possess lands and rights on feudal tenure. W. L. M. It can scarcely be said the Khan was alone in fault, as this would con vey. The Khanazadas had held office about the Khans in previous reigns, but it was reserved to the reign of the young and weak ruler Khodadad to see the development of struggle for power between the Khanazadas and Kobles. The formation of a mercenary force was the necessary sequence. W. L. M. ' I have gained a good deal of infor mation lately which quite confirms our views as to the sinister aims of the Khan at the orio-inal orofanisation of o O the Khanate as a Military Confede racy, which is the form to which we wish to restore it, if possible, but which cannot be carried out without speak ing very plainly and decidedly to the Khan, and showing him that in return for our support of him as Ruler of the State, and securing the throne to him and his successors, we look for the ful filment on his part of the objects we have always had in view from the first, as communicated to him by Jacob.

It has since been settled by the death of the Khan's son. W. L. M. ' -ith. They object to the innova tion of the Khan's appointing his own infant son as heir to the Chief tainship of Jhalawan, the appoint ment being by right and ancient privilege in the hands of the Jhala wan Sirdars themselves, subject to confirmation by the Khan ; and that a son of the Ruler is not eligible to the position, and that such a measure cannot fail to perpetuate the pre sent divided condition of the Kha nate.'

M, ' 1 beg to enclose copy of a letter I have addressed to the Khan on the subject of the affairs of the Khanate generally, which are in a much worse condition than We supposed them to be, whilst labouring under the dis advantage of communicating only with the Khan himself and his Aofents.' 'For instance, I have only now ascer tained from the Sirdars that what the Khan calls his Regiment has swelled into a standing force of 2,000 infantry, 300 horse, and 3 or 4 guns, which cost the State nearly 2 lacs The Mercenary l c o i Brigade. ou ' : 0 * a revenue oi 3|. That this force is mainly a body-guard quartered at Kelat; that it is composed of a set of lawless Mekranees, Puthans, &amp;c. who are under no wholesome control whatever, and commit fearful tyranny in the country. At my earnest remonstrance with the Khan a few months ago, regarding the insecure state of the hkdi road from O the Sind Frontier to the Bolan, he sent a detachment of 60 or 70 men of this body to Bagh, which is utterly useless for the purpose for which it was detached, never attempting to do anything against the Murrees or other border plunderers, but as usual with such rabble, tyrannising over the poor( 40 ) This depends on whether the feudal system can be restored on a sound and safe basis.

' It will be in your recollection that the former Commandant of this body, when it consisted only of some 700 or 800 men, murdered the last Khan (Shere Dil Khan), and there can be no doubt that unless measures are taken gradually to get rid of, or con siderably reduce it, it will sooner or later, give us a good deal of trouble. It is in fact the nucleus of a similar force to what the Hohillas under the Nizam have now attained, and I res pectfully submit that I The Mercenary Brigade. can conceive no more dangerous or mischie vous element than this, which has crept into the administration of the Khan ate of late years.' ' The Sirdars affirm that, were it not for the evil influence of this body guard, they would all be holding their proper places in the State. That Sir dar Taj Mahomed would not have been murdered, and that their own lives and property, and those of their children would not be in constant danger.' &lt;c Thus, in order to arrogate all power and concentrate it in himself at Ke- lat, Khodadad Khan has taken Kha- nazads for his advisers and deputies, and a lawless ribald Soldiery for his body-guard, with whom he lias shut himself up in the Fort of Kelat. His districts are never visited. His Sirdars cannot approach him for fear of their lives.'{ 41 ) Mekran is lield by a firm ruler, Xaib Fukeer Mahomed, wlio refused to join the discontented Nobles. W.

' With regard to the immediate combination of the Sirdars for coercive measures against the Khan, I have so repeatedly impressed upon Sirdar having originated Moolla Mahomed and all, that they or authorised the will get nothing by violent and in temperate conduct, that I have every reason to hope and believe that noth ing of the sort will take place.

Unfortunately this course was not followed, and Moolla Mahomed afterwards at Kelat under that evil influence rejected most liberal and just terms, which the Khan offered him. W. L. M. '•'I enclose copy of a letter that I hate addressed to the Jam of Beyla in re ply to one recently received from him.' ' I have heard all that the Sara- wan Sirdars have to represent, and without pronouncing an opinion upon any specific case, or accepting all to he as stated by them, yet I of fer your Highness the sincere advice of a friend, that it would be for your own good, that all these differences should be settled, in accord with the established rules and customs of the Khanate.' ' One complaint of the Sirdars is, that some of their possessions have been confiscated, and that a body of foreign mercenaries is maintained by your Highness with the proceeds. If this be true, it is not accordant with the usual custom of any King or Ruler.' ' Amongst the objects of the British Government in originally entering upon a Treaty of friendship and support with the ruler of Beloochistan and Kohistan, were these :—' 'That the just and reasonable rights and privileges of every Chief and ryot should be respected, and justice gene rally be administered ; also that life{ 13 ) i and property sLould be secure ; yet at this time, the principal Sirdars of the Khanate affirm that throuarh your O %' Highness' unkindness in this respect) they are driven to stand aloof from you. ' I hope your Highness may resume your kind way of dealing with your Chiefs, that they may all become loyal and obedient subjects. Thus, in the midst of a contented people, your Highness will not need many, if any, foreign mercenaries, and your own Sirdars and people .would then do good service against border plunderers.'

He at once wrote the following letter to the Khan upon the subject:— ' Bhagicana, 22)1(1 April 18G9. From, Captain Harrison, To, H. H. the Khan. After Compliments. ' It should be known to you that when the Sirdar Moolla Mahomed llysanee and other Chiefs left Jacoba- bad, a man who o^ave his name as Mairab Jumalee, an inhabitant of Door-Mahomed's-Gote, stated to the Sirdars that he had a petition to make to your Highness, and solicited their permission to accompany them to Kelat. His petition was not only complied with, but he was treated as a iniest, and went with them to Bevla. O ^ f On the night of the l7th June, when o 7 every one was asleep, Mairab took the sword of a man who was asleep, and proceeded towards Sirdar Moolla Ma homed's tent ; hut seeing a sentry alert, he went to Sirdar Alia Dinna Koord, and succeeded not only in wounding the Sirdar and his two son^, Kubbee Buksh and Yusuff Khan, but unfortunately killed his second son Janee Khan. from the above, your Highness will . , , perceive that the work rsot an act of 1 personal malice. 0 f this assassin COllld not have been from personal enmity, but must have been done at the instiga tion of a third person.

C. H. Harrison. In reporting this event to the No. 703, Of 27th Commissioner in Sind, April 1869. the p 0 ii t i ca i Superin tendent observed as follows— ' 3. Under these circumstances I would solicit a review of the events connected with the causes of dispute between the Khan and his Chiefs, dating from my letter No. 1222 of 14th October last, from which it will appear that the deliberate outrage now reported, has so intentionally widened the breach between the two parties, as to render it very difficult for us to mediate successfully as we had reasonably hoped to do ; for, on the one hand, the Khan will of course repudiate all knowledge of the act, whilst the Sirdars on the other will as strenuously uphold their view, quot ing it as an additional evidence of their oft-repeated charge, viz. that Khodadad Khan is step by step, and year by year, destroying the constitu ted form of Government of the Khan ate, for the purpose of establishing despotic power in his own person and family.'( 40 ) ' Against this tyrannical invasion of their Civil and Political rights, the Chiefs naturally, and I believe justly, claim our protection, asserting that the Treaty of alliance and friendship on the part of the British Government The Treaty is clearly and distinctly is with Khodadad Khan as head of with the Khan of Kelat as ruler of the Confederacy of Eeloochistan, not the country, and the course followed with Meer Khodadad Khan Ahmedzye by previous Political Superintendents as a despotic Prince ; and they urge has been strictly in accordance with with truth that, excepting on the that view, as being the policy intended strength of the British alliance, and and ordered by Government. the power and status which it has W. L.

'These Sarawan Chiefs have, as you are aware, been living in exile and actual want for more than two years, but under the hopes held out to them by my predecessor.

In this he has been signally defeated, and he is now a fugitive in British territory. W. L. M. 'I would therefore respectfully sub mit for consideration, what course it would now be desirable to pursue. On the one hand, our relations with the47 ) Khanate, both in Mekran and on the Sincl Frontier from Kurrachee north wards, are so intimate, that we are pre cluded from withdrawing our support from it's Euler, even temporarily ; and yet, on the other hand, we cannot per mit him to use the power derived from that support in a way that we never intended and that we cannot justly countenance, consistently with the wel fare and interests of the nobles and people generally,' 'Whilst these matters are under con sideration, Captain Harrison and I will do our utmost to pacify the Chiefs and prevent them having recourse to arms. I would submit, however, that without other means at our command than friendly advice and persuasion (which in consequence of hope deferred have well nigh lost their power), it is quite impossible to foresee what men of rank and influence in the country with many thousands of discontented retainers may not be driven to do, under the exasperated state of feeling occasioned by this fresh outrage under report.'' R. PlIAYRE. Sir W. Mcrcwether replied as fol lows :— ' T have to express the regret with No. 266, dated which I have heard of 1st Ma\ 1869. ^| ie unfortunate occur rence which took place at Beyla.' 'While fully sympathising with the sufferers from this dastardily act, and equallyfeelingwith you the importance that may be attached to it by interest ed people, I must caution you to be most careful, how you accept or appear to accept even, any statement intended( 4S ) to involve tlie Khan in this outrage. When a llnler and his influential subjects are at variance,any act against any of the latter would at once be set down both by them and their followers as originating from the source whence they consider all their trials to come from. It is manifestly therefore the more necessary that any report re ceived from them should be accepted with most extreme caution. Moreover, Ineed hardly remind you, that it would be highly unbecoming and most un suitable, for us to allow that we could for an instant give credence to so grave anddishonouring a charge against a Kulcr of a country, and that it would require the most conclusive evi dence before such an accusation should have tiie slightest countenance.'

I was in the Fron tier Districts in February &amp; March. I left them on the 11th March from Kusmore. Colonel Phayre^ did not ' The statement made by the dying assassin, as communicated by Moolla Mahomed llysanee to you, cannot be considered of any weight whatever, and bears the stamp of untruth on it clearly. The man, residing as he did previously at Noor Mahomed Jumalee's Village near llojan, could not have re ceived any orders from the Khan di rect, the latter being at Kelat, and if any evil-disposed person ventured to instigate him to the deed, as one which might be approved of by the Khan— and his dying words would seem to have had reference to that—I need scarcely point out to you how unjust and unseemly it would be, to hastily consider the Khan personally impli cated in the deed. Direct information received here from Beyla mentions that the assassin was a known mad man. Be this however as it may, I consider that we are bound to indig nantly scout the idea of His Highness( 40 ) have bis interview with Moolla Ma homed till his re turn to Jacobahad after that. On the 26th March, ac cording to Colonel Phayre's letter of thatdate, the route to be followed by Moolla Mahomed was decided to be to Kozdar, not Bey)a.

' fc I must now advert to the principles generally shown in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th paras, of your letter, and in the first place, I must disagree with you as to your estimation of our political relations with the Government of Kelat. It is true that His Highness the Khan is the Head of a Confederacy, but it is as such only that we have to do with him, and that in reality we have no business to interfere in the least be tween him and any of his subjects, whether Baron or peasant. I must therefore request that in all your pro ceedings with reference to that Govern ment, you will carefully bear in mind, that our communications are strictly speaking to be solely with the Khan, and that as regards the mode of go verning his country, he alone is res ponsible, and to him alone we must look.' &lt;£ From long connection w r ith the Kelat Government and earnest desire to assist in establishing it on a firm0 ) and secure basis, we have been In the habit of freely giving the best advice we could, but the acceptance of it, and acting upon it, rests with the Khan. Should he obstinately refuse to accept our good offices, it Would then become a matter for consideration, whether the Political A^ent should not be withdrawn from the Court. tf Tor some time past there has been Ho British Officer resident with him, and until Captain Harrison arrives at his Court, we are only in a position to judge by hearsay of what his motives have been, and what his present course of action is likely to be ; of what has occurred for the last year or two, we are mainly dependant for direct infor mation on the statement of those who felt themselves aggrieved, rightly or Wrongly we are not in a position as yet accurately to judge, and under that sense of wrong attempted to obtain by force of arms what they considered their rights, but which His Highness for reasons of his own, which we have yet fully to learn, found himself unable to grant. They failed in their attempt, and had to suffer the privation and exile you allude to.' &lt;£ It will be manifest to yott from what is above written, that the policy I would wish you to follow, is that of friendly counsel to His Highness the Khan, as the sole person in Beloochis- tan with whom we have any right or reason to communicate. That we are in no way entitled to interfere directly between him and his nobles and sub jects ; and to carry out this policy fair ly and justly, it is above all things most important that it should in no way be shown that we are meddling' in the affairs of the country, by identi fying ourselves openly with the cause51 ) of those who are acting in opposition to him.' 'I have in conclusion to request that you will strictly adhere to the princi ples herein set forth, and that you will forward by the quickest means a copy of this letter to Captain Harrison for his guidance.' W. L. M erewether. On the 4th May, Colonel Phayre re plied as follows :— 'Advertingto your 4th para. 1 would snbmit that there has been tio other interference on my part between the Khan and his Chiefs than has been occasionally carried on by my pre decessors, whenever they deemed it to be emergently necessary.' ' In the present instance^ this inter ference has merely con- K otk .—I did • i i • ' n ' ii this ill several sis ted in giving friendly letters One is ac | v i ce to the Khan, ex- given above; pressiVe of the hope that he would for his ow T n, and his country's sake, listen to what his Chiefs had to represent to him; and to the latter, my invariable advice has been that they should submit a res pectful representation of their griev ances to His Highness, wait patiently for redress, and on no account what ever have recourse to arms.' ' This timely intervention allayed their excitement, and inspired them with a hope,which, as all acknowledges, saved Cutchee from being plundered last December, and also restrained such of the Jhulawan Chiefs as had assembled at Bhagwana for hostile operations against Kelat.' 'Thus, up to the present time, such efforts have fully answered their ob-2 ) ject, having had &lt;1 most beneficial efTfct upon our own interests, as well as those of the Khan and his people ge nerally, and I trust that as, ere this r the Sirdars have met Captain Harri son at bhagwana, His Highness will accept our mediation regarding them as originally arranged.' '' £ For the future, however, under the instructions contained in the 7th para, of your letter under reply, no direct communication will be held with the Sirdars as heretofore for pacific or any other purposes, and Captain Harrison will be directed to consider His Hiodi- O ness the Khan as his sole medium of correspondence with them or any one else in the Kelat State.' H. PllAYRE. These orders reached Captain Harri son about the 10th May, about which time the Sirdars, whose minds were very ' unsettled ' owing to the at tempted assassination of the Sarawan Chiefs, had arrived. Captain Harrison then reports on the 13th May from Camp Zooroo :— ' On the 13 th and 12th instant I met the Sirdars, and clearly impressed on their minds that the English Go vernment had satisfied itself that there w T as no truth whatever in the report that had been spread regarding the as sassination of Sirdar Alia Dinna Koord's son.' I also informed the Sirdars that I had come to meet them, as the mutual friend of the Khan and themselves, and that if they had to make any re quest to His Highness, it must be made by themselves in a respectful manner, and that I would use any influence I might have with His High-53 ) Note hy Colonel Fhayre.

Whatever good intentions Moolla Mahomed may have had, and from previous personal acquaintance with that Sirdar, I be lieved him however fully capable of forming them; they would certainly be modified, if not en tirely set aside, when he joined the Jam and his party. Por this reason T wished he should fjo direct to Kelat, following Captain Harrison.

The Sirdars as you are aware met at Beyla. They did not come as you an ticipated in a friendly manner', far otherwise; they have come,accompanied by a considerable force of about 3,000 men, and have one fixed determinations viz. to demand the dis missal of the Shagassee Wullee Mahomed, and disband ment of His Hiffhness' .Regiment. I o o told them that His Highness and the English Government had a verv O «■ high opinion of the Shagassee, and that I did not think their request a reasonable one. Kegarding the Hegi- o o c ment, I said I had no doubt it would be reduced when they (the Sirdars) showed that they had the interest of their Khan and country at heart. In the mean time I recommended that they should rest satisfied if their es tates, &amp;c., were restored.'' The Khan had about 7,000 Troops present at Khelat at this time. ' I left Bhagwana this morning, and the Sirdars have gone to Zeree and intend waiting there until the Khan intimates his wishes to them.' 'From the above you will see that I have been placed in a most unenvi able and critical position. 1 shalli ) however use my best endenvours fo avert hostile proceedings on the part of the Sirdars, and shotv them that though asked to a friendly meeting,- there is no intention of taking part with them against His Highness,' C. H. IL vrutson'. On the Isth May Captain Harrison reached Kelat, and thus reports what occurred there. * ' ' 1 paid a formal Visit to His Highness on the 21st 8thYun6im d I'ltimo. I had a long interview with him, du ring which he gave me a brief sketch of the conduct of the Sirdars, and then asked me if I could conscientiously state that it was for the benefit of him self and country to receive them back into favor. I was obliged to say that they had no claim to his kindness or consideration, but as they had suffered three 3'ears exile and privation, he might find clemency on the present occasion not misplaced. His Highness then of his own free will wrote to Sirdar Moolla Mahomed in the kindest way, stating that he was prepared to restore all hereditary rights/' *' The next thing that was heard of the Sirdars, was, that they were march ing with their full force on Kelat. Shagassee Wullee Mahomed came to me with an urgent request that I would write to the Sirdars in such a way as to prevent further encroachments on their part. 1 demurred at this, as I had received positive instructions on the subject ; as however both His Highness and the Shagassee thought I was bound to act in the matter, I ventured to depart from the rule laid down in Commissioners letter No- 2GG. The spirit of the order however( 55 ) &lt; -- may be considered to have been car ried out, as no letters have been sent ■without being perused and approved by His Highness and the Shagassee.'' ' My letter was to the following effect. That they (the Sirdars) were to move at their peril another step towards Kelat. That they would be allowed two days leave either to come in with 300 followers, or go back to their respective homes. That should they advance, it would be looked upon as a declaration of hostilities against His TI iofhness.' O 'The answer to this was that theV did not feel safe coming in with so j&amp;mall a party. I then, with full con currence of His Highness, sent a Na tive Officer of my escort and 12 men, inviting them to tender their alle* giance, and stating that I would hold myself personally responsible for their safety. They were also distinctly or dered by His Highness tiot to go to Cupota. The Sirdars re- t ioi T aol id te J? fu8e( ^ tbis invitation, and told the Jemedur all they wished was that I would remain neutral, and allow them to settle their differences by force of arms. This message was only a reiteration of what the Sirdars had written.' ' Tn spite of the Khan's expressed wish, and all the injunctions the Sir dars had received not to move, they marched on Cupota and took up a strong position on two hills, running up walls and small bastions at the weak points.' ' Under these circumstances, the fol lowing arrangements were made. Part of the regular troops and levies were sent to Iskulkole to prevent a surprise( 5C ) from that point, the rest of the troops and levies accompanied me to Zaweh. I left them there, and marched to Cu- pota and sent for the Sirdars.' ' As they had behaved so badly, I did not hesitate to tell them in very plain language what I thought of their be haviour, and what they might expect if they did not change their mode of proceeding. Seeing that matters had gone too far, and that I was deter mined not to be trifled with anv longer, O 7 ihey asked permission to consider over what I had been saying. After an hour they returned, saying that they did not wish to moot the questions re- • garding the Shagassee and the liegi- ment,and they had given upall intention of fighting for what they wanted, as they appeared to think that His High- ness might make further concessions if properly represented by them. I agreed to meet them the next day, and marched back to the Khan's Camp.'' ' On the folio win of morninof we re- o o assembled at Cupota, and I could get nothing definite settled until five in the afternoon. Sirdar Moolla Maho med then agreed to return to Kelat with me with 50 of his men.'' ' On the following day T went with Sirdar Moolla Mahomed to call upon II is Ilifdmess, and arranged for a bu- q 7 ry siness interview on the following morn- rJ ing. At the particular request of the Sirdar I was present, and the Khan insisted upon the conversation being carried on in Hindustani, so that [ might understand the rights of the case.

O The Khan kept his temper admirably and fjave an answer to everything. o c O' and when these various points had had been settled, His Highness briefly defined his intentions, viz : that if they (the Sirdars) expected to get any thing, they would have to behave in a becoming manner, and that he would then restore all hereditary rights. Free grants made by himself were declared forfeited by rebellion, and only restor- able, when they had shown by future good conduct that they were worthy of these tokens of regard.'' ' Compensation for defunct Sirdars was positively refused ; two having died a natural death in confinement, and the rest having met their death fairly when fighting against him.' ' In conclusion, he said thatif they be haved well, the}'' would have no reason to regret it. On the other hand, if com pulsion were attempted, he would not give them a farthing, and was quite prepared to defend his rights and assert his position. Considering the behaviour of the Sirdars all through this business, I think liis Highness deserves the greatest credit for having consented to restore hereditary lands, supplemented with a promise that their interests would be further at tended to, if they showed themselves worthy of further favor.' ' After this interview, Sirdar Moolla Mahomed returned to Capota, and as the Chiefs would not make up their mind one way or another, I wrote to them at the request of His Highness, saying that the force at Zara had finished all the grass and water, and would be obliged to march on CapotaI ( 5S ) the following morning, so that if tliey (the Sirdars) wished to avoid coming into collision with His Highness'troops, they had better fell back and march on their homeward route. To this a speedy reply was sent, asking me to come alone and have half an hour's conversation with them, and (hat they would then either return with me or go peaceably to their homes.' ** I accordingly requested the Sha- gassee to delay his march until I had given the Sirdars one more opportu nity. On reaching Capota all the Sirdars came to see me, except Az^ad Khan, and he did his utmost to com promise the Sirdars beyond all hope by sending repeated messages, saying that the Khan's Army was in sight and close upon them. I told the Sirdars that I could see what Azaad Khan intended, and that they might rest assured that as I had told them I would come alone, the Khan's Army would not move a step until they heard the result of my present visit.

' Being aware that I knew on what grounds the Jam framed his preten^ sions, as also the rule in Beloochistan regarding intestate estates, His High ness asked me to write to the Jam from himj with the view of avoidiog all further disputes for the future.

' From all that has happened 1 see that until the dispute regarding the Village of Kummul Khan is settled, that there will always be dissension between the Khan and yourself. His Highness has therefore asked me to Write to you on the subject, and to settle the case from my knowledge of the circumstances.' ' 1 st. You say that you are entitled to the Village by right of your mother.' ' 2nd.

This His Highness positively denies,''GO ) ' Howard ins: these claims one slultl- o o fies the other.

' In the time of the great Nusseer Khan, at the request of all the Sirdars in Beloochistan, the Mahomedan law regarding the right of females to in herit property was cancelled, and as this Bclooch law is still in force, I do not see how you can have any claims through your mother.'' ' The statement that you hold the property in the late Nusseer Khan's time, and during part of His Highness' reign, was distinctly denied by the Khan in presence of Sirdar Moolla Mahomedjand that Sirdar was directed to invite you to come in person and prove whatever claims you might have, and that if the proofs were sa tisfactory, further opposition on his part would be withdrawn. It is ge nerally known that His Highness at the end of last year allowed you to receive charge of the Village, only however on this proviso, that you would come at an early date to Kelat and substantiate the claim you say you have,' ' As you have declined both invi tations, it can only be considered that you have voluntarily resigned your pretensions. Under these circumstan ces I think it would be advisable for you to withdraw any agent you may have placed there, and consider the Village as belonging to His Highness, the lawful heir, until such time as you feel disposed to prove your right to the same.' C. H. H aiuuson.CI ) A On the Srd June Sir AY. Merewether conveyed liis approval of Captain Harrisons proceedings* as above re- ported, as follows :— ' Capt. Harrison s proceedings have my fullest approval and nnreserved commendation. In a position of great difficulty and delicacy, he has shown admirable firmness and sound judg ment. The interference he was called upon to engage in, was forced npon him, and I cannot too strongly express my high opinion of the coolness, firm ness, and excellent tact he displayed throughout. Though actively inter fering, he did so in a thoroughly sys tematic manner; always working with, through, and for the Khan, and for the best interests of the country His Highness has to rule over. It will afford me great pleasure to bring his valu able services to the notice of His Ex cellency the Governor in Council. ' w ' ' The sole object of my letter of 1st May and subsequent correspondence was to caution you against what ap peared to me—unintentionally I con ceived on your part—a too active in terest in and partisanship with the Sirdars, whose tale you had heard, and with whom your generous feelings were leading you to join against the Government with whom alone we really had to do. The events that have taken place clearly establish the cor rectness of the opinion formed as to the desio-ns of the recusant Sirdars, O and I cannot help adding that had you adhered to the same course you so aptly adopted last October, in ad-( 02 ) This is an assumption and not a fair one. The truth now appears to be, that the Jam's troops and follow ers, it is said by his order, plundered Bey la before the Shagassee eould reaeh it. When he did, he set to work to restore order. W. L.

The Jam himself has taken refuge with some of his followers in the hills between Beyla and our border, west of Sell wan, where it is supposed the Sha- gassee will not attempt to follow him. Having thus brought the narrative of the leading events in the reign of Khodadad Khan down to the present year, I woidd respectfully offer the following remarks regarding them.( 03 ) The terms of the Treaty have been * on the whole -well adhered to hv the * Ivhan. The advice given hy General Jacob is a separate thing. Close atten tion to it has been as much if not more defeated by the misconduct of the Chiefs, than by faults of the Khan. W. L. M, Afterwards removed from power and since dead. AV. L. M. Of this weakness the Chiefs showed an early intention of taking advan tage. W. L, M. It appears the original intentions of Government as ex- dS7 b a Passed in the Treaty, strong friendly ail( j explained l)v Ge- Government. 1 •' neral Jacob personally at the Conference with the Khan which preceded its ratification, have not been fulfilled up to the present timCj so far as concerns the protection of life and property in the Khanate ; tlie protection of cultivators and traders; safe and easy roads; and final ly the administration of justice to all—• nobles and people. Any honest attempt to establish a ' Strong friendly Government' on such a basis would be indeed worthy of our support, but instead of that y We find that no sooner did Nusseer Khan—who was the sincere friend of the British Govern ment, and beloved by all his Chiefs and peo ple—show an honest de- termination to act up to the Treaty, than he incurred the implacable hatred of the Chief Khanazad, the Daroga Gool Mahomed. This enemy of the British Govern ment finding that British influence was stronger than his own in the Councils of the Khan ; and perceiving that his master's mind could not be moulded into their treacherous designs towards us ; resolved upon, and final ly accomplished his murder in the manner related by Sir Henry Green. Sir Henry Green's report dated 4th De cember 1858. May 1837. Wo then learn that the present Kuler Khodadad Khan, ' a youth of 10 of weak intellect,'' was taken from the harem in Kelat, where he had been confined up to that time, andbecame the helpless tool of this fac tion of household slaves who, from This was only the case in the time that moment, have marched steadily of the Daroga Gool Mahomed and to power, secretly yet surely thwart- Lunnia Gungaram ; and has ceased ing every one who has opposed them, entirely since 1858. commencing with General Jacob and W. L. M, Sir Henry Green. The said-to-be perpetrator has long since disappeared. W. L. M. A fair review of events and later acts show the contrary. the course of of the Sirdars W. L. M. The time and circumstances under which the foul murder of Nusseer Khan was committed ought never to be forgotten, because there can bo little doubt that it had some connec tion with the general outbreak which occurred in Ilindoostan during that time, the primary object of the Da- roga being to retrieve his lost power, at The Khanazads a m oment when he fer- during the mu- vently hoped that the tinies. . . British power in India would be crushed for ever. The fac tion therefore that revolutionised the country at that critical moment, de priving us of a real friend, and Be- loochistan of a beloved Sovereign, O * would no doubt repeat this act, were a similar opportunity to occur again. The Sarawan and Jhulawan Chiefs on the other hand were staunch and loyal to us, as their murdered master had been ; cheerfully obeying Colonel Green's calls upon them, in spite of the bad treatment they had received from the new Khan Khodadad's party. In deed, with the single exception of the Jam of Bey la, their conduct contrasts most favorably with that of the Kha- nazad Government throughout the whole of the period under reference. Sir Henry Green relates how the Treacherous firSt act of tho faction, attack of Sep- alter the accession of tember 1857. the new Khan, was to Sirdars Moolla Mahomed and Taj Mahomed during the Mu tinies.I ( 05 ) At this time even tlie Sirdars com menced preferring unreasonable de mands. W. L. M. The whole circumstances should he taken into consideration in forming a judgment here. W. L. M. There is nothing to show they are allowed uncontrolled license now. Were they, much more would be heard of them than is the case. A late re port from Captain Harrison points to the contrary. It has arisen in conse quence of the disaifection and mis behaviour of the Chiefs. W. L. M. The circumstances do not bear out this conclusion. W. L. M. make the base and treacherous attack upon the unsuspecting Chiefs, who had assembled at Kelat to eleet a head, and were at that time encamped outside the walls, with only a few of their retainers. This diabolical act laid the founda tion of all the fighting and mischief that has since occurred, by sowing the seeds of eternal feud between Khodadad and his Chiefs, nullifying at one stroke all that General Jacob had worked so hard to establish. The cowardly deed was effected by a fine, which then upheld and still consti tutes the strength of Khanazad Go vernment. In 1857, Sir Henry Green characterised it as a Khanazad ideas of a ' strong Go- u band of about 400 ' scoundrels of sorts; de- ' sorters from our Belooch Regiments, ' Patans, and Afghans,with men from ' all parts of Central Asia.' This permanent force has now grown into a Brigade of upwards of 2,000 men, and if the original 400 of these ruffians were, as Sir Henry says per- ' mitted uncontrolled license and were a scourge to the country around,' what, we may ask, must not a Bri gade of 2,000 of them be ?' In it we have the mainspring of the Ivhanazad Government of Kelat, and it may readily be believed that the Chiefs and people of Beloochistan only suffer it to exist, owing to the unqualified support which we give to the present Kuler, through which they are intimidated.( &lt;5G ) The proceedings at Kelat have been very carefully watched and well un derstood for many years past. W. L. M. Very different in many respects. The Government officials of Kelat have been very different to what they were before 1858, as good as could be, and in spite of very adverse circum stances the Government now promises to be stronger than it has ever been. The severe course pointed out by Lord Elphinstone's Government, here alluded to, was in consequence of most unfavourable opinions passed on the Khan himself bv all the authori- ties in Sind; such is not the case now. W. L. H. I doubt if the real character and unquestionable tendency of this sys tem has attracted the attention ^vhich it deserves. The circumstances now are precisely what they were in 1858, excepting that all is on a far larger and more serious scale. The whole of the despatches to and from Lord Elphinstone's Government in 1858, from February to December, show what was going on. Those of June are particularly applicable to the pre sent time. That is, only of the Chiefs and some few others, who are distant from the scene. W. L. M, That the Khan himself soon imbibed the spirit of his Khanazads, is clear from his vindictive speech regarding Taj Mahomed to Captain Dickinson, which showed beyond denial what he was capable of; and we know, that a spirit of that sort, laying hold of the young Ruler of a semi-barbarous State ' of weak intellect' is not easily extinguished, and therefore, in the words of Mr. Erere's despatch, above quoted, ' I am convinced that our ' first care ought to be to obtain some ' assurance before we further support ' the Khan, that his future Govern- (&lt; ment shall be such as to give rea- &lt;£ sonable satisfaction to his Chiefs and ' subjects.' The murder of the good Nusseer Khan; the treacherous attack on the Chiefs of September 1857 ; the repu ted murder of Taj Mahomed ; the at tack on the Sarawan Chiefs of last spring; are all attributed by public opi nion to the Khanazads, and there cer tainly is a consistent aim and conse quent action observable in all, that( 67 ) The acts of the Sirdars, since the commencement of the present Khan's reign, have certainly not helped to remedy this state of affairs. W. L. M. The appointment of a member of Taj Mahomed's family has been ar ranged for. W. L. M. The Treaty entered into by General Jacob had reference to the prevention of attacks on onr border by subjects of the Kelat State, and protection of Merchants. He gave his advice freely and soundly besides to the then Khan, and that his advice has not been followed, is due as much to the mischievous behaviour of the Chiefs, as to the system of Government they permit in attacking without reason, and complaints against which they always bring forward. W. L. M. It would be expedient first of all to establish clearly that such is the case, and next to learn what amount of interference Government considers it right to adopt in the matter of the Government of an independent Sove reign. W. L. M. Sir Henry Greens opinion referred renders it difficult to contravert the assertion of the Sirdars, that Khoda- bad Khan desires to exterminate them and to usurp their rights and their property. The Khan last year ap pointed his infant son to the vacant Chieftainship of Jhulawan, in viola tion of all rule; but the child died and Jhulawan is yet without a head. Had Sirdar Moolla Mahomed been killed last spring, Sarawan also would have been without a head. Now indeed it virtually is so, Moolla Ma homed having been obliged again to flee the country. I respectfully submit that nothing could be further from the objects and intentions ol General Jacob's treaty than a Government like this. Our ob ject was, and still is, to civilise, re form, improve, and thus attach to us a grateful contented people who, in the hour of need, would take the hono rable and faithful part in the defence of the empire that these noble races are capable if, well led and properly han dled ; yet, instead of such results, after eleven years of work of the Khanazad system of Government, nothing but anarchy, confusion, discontent, and indeed all the natural fruits of the crimes with which the reign was inau gurated, prevail. Thus, apart altogether from higher principles, it would be well, as a mat ter of mere policy to remonstrate with a power which, having in the first instance treacherously drawn the No bles to save their lives by measures of self defence, has persisted in calling them rebels, and confiscating their estates ever since. Again, in another point of. view, if Sir Henry Green has rightly cha-( 08 ) to tlie first levy—12 years ago. It by no means follows that opinion should he applicable now, and recent reports show it is not. Moreover, Sir Henry Green latterly changed his views en tirely with regard to the entertain ment of the mercenaries, considering it now necessary for the due mainte nance of order. W. L. M. ractcrisedthe Khan's force—and it was only 400 strong when he wrote—it is scarcely to our interest, or that of the country either, that a Brigade ot trained though utterly licentious soldiery should be the Vanguard of British India upon the left flank of the most important face of the Frontier. It has first to be proved that the system is a bad one. No Government with a lot of ambitious Chiefs lighting Looking at the accompanying sketch map, which shows the whole Frontier from Peshawar to Kurrachee, the stra tegical and political importance of Be- loochistan are too apparent to require comment here. Apart therefore, as I before remarked, from higher princi ples, it can hardly be to our national interest to support the Brigade of mer cenaries in Kelat, and the system which they upheld in such a manner as to incur the odium of the 30 or 40,000 for power, would indeed be a danger- Brahooes outside ; w T ho, with an equal ous matter in the country next to us. number of Belooch, constitute ' the AY. L. M, real strength of the country.' Supposing, for argument's sake,that war had broken out with Russia or Persia, or both, one of our first anx ieties would be the safety and inde pendence of that long weak line of Indus valley communication for 300 miles between Kurrachee and Sukkur : broken only by a weak garrison at Hydrabad, which has its own respon sibilities to protect. It is therefore the more necessary there should be a strong Government in Beloochistan under one head, and not that the country should be parcel led out amongst a number of uncer tain Chiefs. Note hy Colonel Phayre. The Jam of Beyla has just taken refuge in these hills. R. P. W. L. M. Note hy Sir W. Merewether. This Jam of Beyla has been at the bottom of all the mischief in Beloochistan for the last 12 years. W. L. M. The whole of that tract as far as Jacobabad is flanked by a rugged hilly country, inhabited by Brahooes and Belooch, the subjects of Kelat, many of whose Chiefs have been and still are in so-called rebellion against the present Khanazad Government.( 69 ) Quite so, If there was not a respon sible ruler to prevent such. W. L. M. It is with the view of avoiding this, that the power of the Khan should not be destroyed, and the country left to the chance fancies of a number of factious Chiefs. W. L. M. This is most true, and has always been borne carefully in mind by me, and Is so still. The letter from which this is quoted, was written by me in reply to a reference from Government, whether It was advisable or not to re tain a British Officer at Kelat, and I strongly urged the necessity of it, and am of the same opinion still. W. L. M. To this I do not assent, as shown in all my above remarks. W. L. M. This is not sound doctrine; is a very dangerous course to follow ; and con trary to the principles laid down by Government. W. L. M. Note hy Colonel Pha yre.

I respectfully submit that the first part of this apprehension is in danger of immediate fulfilment, unless we step in to prevent it. Internal dissensions are fast reaching their eulminatiner point, as the events of the last few months prove. It is quite as much our right according to Treaty, as it is to our national interest, to separate the factious, and do for them, what they cannot do for themselves. Again, looking at Kelat in another strategical point of view, as an impor tant centre with reference to the Eolan and Moolla passes on our frontier ; and to Persian Mekran, Persian Seistan, and Kandahar on the opposite border. Is it not a dangerous position In which to nurse such an element of weakness to ourselves, as a mutinous mercenary Brigade, composed partly of the scum( 70 ) Mercenaries on our Frontier, E. P. Note hj Colonel I* hay re* It is stronofe r than the Jacoba- bad Field Force. Fv. P. purpose it is used. If to strengthen a friendly Govern ment and main tain order, its value would be be great. Colonel Phayre's supposi tion that it is for the contrary is, I think, a mistaken one. Papers on this point are ap pended. W. L. M. Note hy Sir IF. Merewether, The Jacobabad Field Force num bers :— Cavalry 1 ,479 Infantry .4. 713 W. L. M. of our armies, and partly of Persian and Central Asian spies and emissaries ? No one seems to know anything about this force, or how it has quintupled itself since 1857. It has always been represented that the Khan was so poor, that he had to live from hand to mouth, and yet this costs a considera ble amount of ready money annually ! I The Chiefs complain that theyand their children have been robbed and im poverished to maintain it; and if that be true, it is a serious matter, because it can only be done in the strength of our support. Sir Henry Green fixed it at 400 strong (in 1857) yet it now outnumbers the Jacobabad Field force, and would infallibly be made a bad use of in the time of war, as seen in 1857. General Jacob's object was to see a good and strong Government formed in Beloochistan, and gave the best advice to that efiect. That it did not happen as he proposed, was owing to the force of circumstances, and to none more than to the misbehaviour ol the leading Chiefs of the country. W. L. M. Neither the Treaty nor its accom paniments warrant direct interference. But our best advice, as was given at I am the more earnest upon this point, because it cannot be denied that the fewer Sittanas we have upon this frontier, the better. I respectfully submit, without fear of its being controverted, that this force and the system of whicli it forms the basis, constituted no part of Gene ral Jacobs policy, sanctioned by Lord Dalhousie s Government in 1854. It was intended by that policy to mould both Brahooes andBelooch to our pur pose, through their affections ; never by the harsh mode of treatment into which theKelat Government has drifted. I merely solicit with the greatest defer- Policy advo- ence the princi- cated - pies of the Treaty and its accompaniment may be quiet ly .but consistently inculcated and( 71 ) the time of the Treaty being first made (and it should be borne in mind that the accompaniment was not the Treaty, or part if it, as inferred by Colonel Phayre) should always be readily accorded. W. L. M. Quite so—but to do that, by forcing refractory Chiefs on the Euler, would not be in accordance with the views of Lord Elpliinstone's Government, of justice, or of sound policy. W. L. M. When penning this, the events that occurred at Kelat in May last seem quite to have escaped Colonel Phayre's recollection. His Ilighness the Khan then acted as Lord Elphinstone's Government &amp; Sir Bartle Pre re would have desired. In spite of extreme provocation, he readily lis tened to the advice of the Political Agent, showed great toleration and moderation, but his clemency was in solently rejected by the fractious Chief of Sarawan. W. L. M. All depended on the ' if,' and nei- supported, without alarming the Khan or his advisers. No faction should be allowed to predominate in the State, whether Khanazad or aristocratic. Our object and our desire is to see justice done to all—nobles, as well as people. 'VYe may be sure that, to use the words of Lord Elphinstone's Government in 1858, ' to right ourselves with the ' Chiefs and people of Beloochistan' is a step in the right direction, and that each step gained in advance on that basis, and properly used when it is gained, will soon allay all the revo lutionary fermentation that now dis tracts the country, unsettling every thing, and everyone connected with it. I need scarcely say that had I known the whole of the facts now produced, before assuming the task in March last of trying to reconcile the Khan with the Jhulawan and Sarawan Chiefs, and to obtain justice for them, I should not have attempt ed using the ordinar}'- means of re presentation for that purpose. I should have been convinced, as the Commissioner, Mr, Frere, expressed it ' of the hopelessness of our get- ting from His Ilighness in return ' for all that we do for him, any but ' negative results,' by such means, and I should have asked for permis sion to give Captain Harrison the same orders that Lord Elphinstone's Government issued for Major Green's guidance, in para, 4 of their letter No. 2265 of 1858, already quoted above. Para 9 of that letter runs as fol lows :— ' If Khodadad Khan is the worth-( 72 ) ther Sir Bartle Frere, General Jacob, ' less man that lie is represented to be, myself, or Sir Henry Green, found it ' the Right Honorable the Governor expedient or just to carry out the in Council considers that the sooner extreme measure Lord Elphinstone's ' we leave him to his fate, the better ; Government pointed out as dependant ' but I am desired to request that on that' if.'

It was so long as three years after this very distinct command had been given, that the Khan unconeciously unveiled his real character, when he ventured to say to the British Agent This Chief was afterwards proved at his Court regarding the 2nd Chief to be an inveterate intriguer and de- in the Khanate whom he had done all termined enemy of the Khan, which he could to drive to desperation, that would account in a great measure for ' by the assistance of God, and of the the Khan's feelings against him.

I think this brother resigned it and went home ; was a mistake, as the presence of an because I do not believe that, under English Officer with the Khan, ready the present tone maintained at Kelat to afford advice at the moment it is on the strength of the Brigade of needed, is of the first importance. I_ mercenaries, the Political Agent with a do not share Colenel Phayre's doubts Troop of Cavalry for his escort, is in a as to the Agent being independent, sufficiently independent position, lie( 73 ) Though reported of ' weak intellect' when he first came to the throne, the Khan has greatly improved in this respect; and no one now knows better than he does, the advantage of having a British Officer at his Court, or the danger to himself and his country that would be involved in his with drawal. W. L. M. This was when the Daroga was working against him, and for the time all powerful. Such a state of affairs no longer exists, nor is likely to recnr. Should it, it would then be time enough to consider the advisability of withdrawing the Agent. W. L. M. Nor has he now. W. L. M. most certainly is not, ifhe should hap pen to be charged with orders to insist upon an unpalatable observance of the Treaty, in regard to doing justice to all, as already adverted to. Sir Henry Green himself describes that, when the mercenaries were only 400 strong, he was not independent, until his brother reached Kelat with about 200 of the Sind horse; consequently, now that the same body numbers upwards of 2,000 men, the position is more unten able than ever, with a small escort ; and I feel sure that, whatever may be the orders of Government as to the future, none but ' negative results' will be obtained, unless we manage to put a stop to the practice of hunting down or exiling Chief after Chief, aa is now the case. In describing the difficulty of his position at Kelat, and the relief that followed the arrival of a strong escort, Sir Henry Green says ' the Detach- ' ment arrived at Kelat on the 1st ' August, much to the delight of the ' poor, the merchants, and lovers of peace ; but to the disgust of the ' evil-minded. I now felt that I had ' gained sufficient influence amongst ' the people and Chiefs, and backed by ' 200 Sind horse, I could take a higher ' stand with the Daroofa.' O * We here see what stress Sir Henry lays upon his having the Chiefs and people with him, when about to strike a blow for them, by getting rid of the Head of the Khanazad faction. In those days the Khan was not strongly enough backed by Military force to accuse Sir Henry of heading rebellious subjects, whilst merely ad-{ The clrcumstanceB last spring -were totally differentj as the events clearly show.

But even their sympathy is limited, for, on the first occasion of the Sirdar taking refuge with them, &gt; they i refused to give him any assistance in his projects, and would do so still. The Boogtees, ) Hinds, Dhoomkees f Miigzees, and other Belooch have little sympathy with him. W. L. M. The Sirdar's late flight to the Mur- ree Hills was quite unnecessary. He was in no danger at Seebee. I believe his object in going to the Murrees was the hope of, through them, getting again to the British authorities. AV. L. M. Since writing the above,' I have learned from Captain Sandeman that the Murrees have addressed him on behalf of Moolla Mahomed. W.' L. M.

This scene illustrates precisely what I aimed at last spring, without my having known what had occurred in this and other instances of a similar kind. The whole of the Belooch • the Mur rees in particular ; sympathise with the cause of the Jhulawan and Sara- wan Chiefs and people, and I respect fully Urge that it is not wise or politic to ignore the existence and secret effect of such sympathies amongst an excitable and impulsive population, such as this is. Even whilst I am writing, I have received a report, which may bring about serious complica tions. I allude to the fact of Sirdar Moolla Mahomed, with his family and nearest relatives, having thro' fear of the Khan, taken refuge in Kahun, the Head Quarters of the Murree tribe ; and we know that those mountaineers will protect them to the utmost of their power. Had the original cause of quarrel with the Khan been an -act of their own, we could have justly told the Sirdars that they had brought all their misfortune on themselves ; but Sir Henry Green has shown clearly that the original cause of all, was the O ' treacherous attack of September 18.'37, followed by gross insults ; since which the Khanazads, have, in their own interests, used the implacable charac ter of the Khan, as an effectual bar to any lasting accommodation being brought about.I t o ) The correspondence will show that this restriction became necessary. It was most reluctantly put in force, and would only apply to the Sirdars, who were deliberately plotting against their Sovereign, with whom it was unbe- cominof that the British authorities c5 should hold communication, or give any countenance to, while they were behaving in the way reported at the time. W. L. M. Captain Sandeman has no Political relations with the Government of Kelat. His direct action with the There is therefore I would -.sabanit a natural opening for us to interpose with our good offices. In the correspondence we see that the Political- Superintendent on this Frontier and the Political Agents at Kelat have always been allowed.to exercise their own . judgment as , to Whom they would receive, and whom not. This Was in fact the only safety- valve which the Chiefs had. The ex tracts of correspondence show that Sir Henry Green, Major Macauley, Captain Dickinson and Major Malcolm Green, always received the Chiefs, even though they were in so-called rebellion ; heard what they had to say, and recorded their petitions for the information of Government; but now, this privilege, which the Chiefs themselves called ' the last door of hope' has been closed to,them by recent leu—S 01 &lt; lfcrs . which. I respect- fully solicit may . be modified, so as to leave it optional with the Political Super intendent to act according to circum stances. Under its action the Kelat Politi cal Agent is reduced to v the position of a mere partisan of the Khan's, and it has operated prejudicially to my own authority and influence in the vicinity of Jacobabad, being opposed to the free action observed towards the Murrees and Boogtees by Punjaub Officers; indeed, without this freedom, Captain Sandeman could never have gained the confidence of those tribes, and laid the foundation of their recla mation, which the Punjaub Govern ment, the Government of India, and the Home Government have so fully eulogised and supported. dated 1st May 1860.( '6 ) Murrees and Boogtees has been ap proved; but as soon as proper arrange ments can be made, in conjunction with His Highness the Khan, for the proper management of those Tribes, it will be unquestionably proper that all communications with the Murrees and Boogtees, including Captain Sandeman's, should only be through the Political Superintendent on the Prontier. W. L. M. This opinion is formed on altogether wrong premises, as shown in marginal notes above. If the course involved in it was followed, an amount of inter ference with an independent Govern ment must take place, such as was never contemplated by Government, or the country would be given up to a state of anarchy and confusion as would lead to most lamentable results. W. L. M. On this frontier, from Peshawur to Kurrachee, we are in the presence cf Foreign powers, who are accurately informed of all that is going on at certain important centres, of which Kelat is one. Nothing could play into their hands more completely than any system which would alienate the affections of the bulk of the people from ns; and therefore I am humbly, but strongly, of opinion that it is low ering the British prestige that its representatives in Beloochistan should be expected to see, hear, and speak, solely, under the inspiration of a lac- tion of household slaves, who, as the records of the last few years prove, have unjustly seized the reins of Go vernment. The natural effect of this will be, that in a very short time, instead of our moulding the Khan and the pre sent Government to our purpose as we want to do according to Treaty ; we shall be inevitably moulded to theirs ; and when the hour of need comes, the real strength of the country will be against us. Instead of weakeninor it would O 7 really strengthen the Khan's Govern ment, if uuder our good advice and( ' ) influence it can be brought to govern on enlightened principles; because the people of the country would then feel and see that we do not intend ouV powerful support to be used against their proper rights any longer. We may rest assured that Belooch and Brahooes will never submit to a harsh rule, and it is an undeniable fact that the present rule would not stand for a day, were our support withdrawn from it. Hence our res ponsibility for its character. This was pointed out in 1858, and since that, matters have become worse. No one doubts it for a moment, and We ought to bear in mind that if Colonel Phayre has an opportunity— both Belooch and Brahooe Chiefs dis- as I hope he soon will have—of dis- cuss these matters much more clearly cussing these matters more generally and reasonably than many give them with the Khan and other Sirdars of credit for.

Napier and Lord Melville. It was not till after General Jacob went to the Frontier in 1847, that attention was much drawn to the adjoining State. He was appointed Political Superintendent in February 1848, but it was only after the visit of the Wuzzeer Moolla Mahomed Hoossein to Jacobabad on the 11th W. L. M.( 78 ) March 1851, that Kelat affairs began again to command any marked atten tion. W. L. M. AVe held Kelat for about 6 months in 1811, during which, one or two brother Officers and myself were on terms of personal friendship with several of the Brahooe Chiefs of that day, who showed us excellent sport with their well-bred greyhounds, which we returned by inviting them to rifle matches at our Camp. Colonel Stacy of the Bengal Army was the Political Agent at Kelat at that time, and it was under the genial influence of his treatment of the Chiefs as gentlemen ; which as a rule they are, naturally as well as by birth ; that the cordial relations to which I allude existed ; giving a tone to the young Khan's position, which lasted up to the hour of his sad fate, as record ed by Sir Henry Green. A careful study of this reign is One and all—Belooch and Brahooes, necessary for Government to arrive at Chiefs and peasants—declare how just conclusions. During the first part, happy they were under the ' strong the Wuzzeer MoollaMahomedHoossein friendly Government'' of this Prince, was all powerful, but conspiring to be The reason was that his rule had the Khan himself, his treachery was ex- paternal and patriarchal elements in it. posed by General Jacob to the Khan, Nusseer Khan had a just regard for the and he was imprisoned.

L. M. British Government and its interests. I would submit that the whole question admits of being summed up in a very few words.( 79 ) The Khan has only lately shown every desire to be tolerant and mer ciful, but his offers were rejected. The Khan shows no desire to act against our remonstrances. It would certainly not strengthen his power to support fractious subjects against him. &gt;Y. L. M. Alluding to Mahomed Hoossein, the Wuzzeer, who was removed. Since the removal of the Daroga and Gungaram in the subsequent reign, there has certainly been no thwarting by Officers. W. L. M. Yet it was never found necessary or right to carry out the alternative mentioned by Lord Elphinstone's Go vernment, nor is it now. The friend ship of the people of Beloochistan will be best secured by giving them order and quiet which, owing to ambitious dissensions, they have not hitherto enioved. W. L. M. On the one side it is sought to esta- . Wish a ' strong Government'' by un qualified support of the Khan, irrespec tive of the character and popularity of his rule. This policy secures the Khan himself and his Khanazads, but is gra dually alienating the Chiefs and peo ple from us. On the other hand I advocate the support of the Khan also, but would make him strong by acting upon those principles of Government which our Treaty provides for, viz. support in sound and good measures, but remon strance against such as are faulty and bad. This was General Jacob's policy, for when ratifying the Treaty in 185i, he says ' from the first day of my ' receiving charge of the Frontier of ' Sind, I have exerted every effort in ' my power to bring about the esta- ' blishment of order and good Govern- ' ment in your Highness' neighbour- ' ing dominions, but I laboured to ' little or no purpose, because I was ' always thwarted by your Highness' ' Officers.' This was also the policy of Lord Elphinstone's Government in 1858, and was communicated to Sir Henry Green for his guidance, and acted on by him ever since, because he repeat edly shows throughout his reports that the Khan's friendship must not be purchased at the expense of his people's ; which is the sum total of all that I contend for.( 80 ) The cause or causes are simple and plain enough. Since March 1865, the Jam of Beyla has been unceasing in his attempts to overthrow the Khan's power, also aided hyAzaad Khan. Un less absolutely called for, the Khan would have been unwise to leave the capital of his kingdom, which was centrally situated, and nearest to his greatest enemies. W. L. M. We should not blind ourselves to the significance of the fact that Kho- dadad Khan has shut himself up in his citadel of Kelat since 18G5. He moved out with a force for a month or six weeks at the end of last year, for a short distance against the Jam, but he remained several miles away from the scene of operations. There must be a cause for his thus shrinkino- from visiting his districts for such a length of time, and I submit that we ought to be fully satisfied as to what that cause is, whilst giving unreserved support to a rule which engenders such an unmis- takeable sign of unpopularity and in deed fear of his subjects. Captain Harrison reports also that the Jam was doing his best to tamper with the Khan's followers and adhe rents, but it does not at all follow that they would have joined him, though he might have thought it worth while risking- the chance of their doinsr so. o The easy way in which the Jam was overthrown in October last would lead to the conclusion that his cause was not favored. W. L. M. Many circumstances warn us not to make enemies of the Chiefs and people. For instance, when the Chiefs were at Kelat last May with 3,000 armed followers, there were altocrether 7,000 men with the Khan ; and yet Captain Harrison reports that the Chiefs expressed the wish ' that I ' Avould remain neutral, and allow them to settle their differences by ' force of arms. This message was ' only a reiteration of what the ' Sirdars had written.' It is scarcely possible, I think, that such a request would have been preferred in the face of double num bers, had not the Chiefs been assured that if a melee had ensued, a portion at all events of the Khan's levies would have joined them.e \ ( 81 ) These Eraliooe levies ' were the &lt;c Chiefs and their followers.'

I would therefore during the present time of peace anticipate them by re moving their grievances and settling the country as soon as possible through the medium of their riofhtful Sovereign.
