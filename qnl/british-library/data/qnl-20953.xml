From—M ajob P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Government of India in the Foreign Department. our new Agent - 1 I have the honour to submit the question of the status of Bahrein. 2. As Assistant Political Agent Captain Prideaux ranks lower than he did four years ago as Pirst Assistant Resident, Bushire? lower than any Vice- Consul, and -h fortiori much lower than Lieutenant Shakespear, His Britannic Majesty's present Consul at Bunder Abbas. 3. When it was decided to modify the arrangements for our representa tion at Manama, it was, I think, the wish of Government to make the post one of superior status from all stand-points ; and especially in view of the frequent relations which he will have with His Majesty's ship^ it is advisable that the incumbent of the Baurein appointment should carry with him suitable precedence among officers of the Navy. 4. Referring to despatch No. 74 of 31st March 1904 from the Govern ment of India to the Secretary of State and to your subsequent telegram dated 16th August 1904, I gather that all idea of our having Consular representation at Kateef or El Katr is for the time postponed ; on the other hand, there may be technical objections to the addition of another Political Agent's appointment to the list of posts under the Poreign Department. I trust, however, that it may at all events be found possible to gazette Captain Prideaux as holding the local rank of Political Agent, or Consul, and solicit the early consideration of this question by the Government of India. .

That did not s-trilte me because I thought we had put the term aside as unsuitable, when we were talking over it at Bahrein. Apart from the effect of the change of designation on your local standing, I have al ways regarded it as having a further signification and justifying a somewhat different treatment of your official -correspondence to what would be usual in - Captain P.B.Prideaux, I.

Thus,in an the case of Assistant Resident and an Assistant a ; Political Agent, I do not think the Resident would be expected or called upon to forward the officers' views in original to Government if he for an3^ rea- son did not see fit to do so. On the other hand when they give their representative enhanced rajik I ha/ve taken for granted that G-overniuent Wish to- hear his views and have not considered myself jus tified in withholding them, without giving him^ v ^ good reasons, even though I might not necessarily 111B m m agree with them.

If then tkte officers on List B ar&lt;* tke pick of their service tkey cannot aent worse treatment than tke Military officers of the same class introduced fror. the Punjab. ^5) Another aspect of the case is one which may at first sight seem trivial but vrhick is, nevertheless, one which, \ may be submitted, rev^uires very careful consideration. Is it not possible and mdoca highly probable that tlu influence■BHPPH % which the Military officers in the Departnent have up to aovr been able to exercise in the discharge of their duties in the Native States ana Kls#wk»re will be lessened just in proportion to the amount that their statue has been lessened as conpared with the recainnig officers who coa~rise the Department? Is it to be supposed that a native of India, than whom none is . A uicKer to note and compare the status of two officers will not note the fact of an officer who is aanifestly tho junior of another officer in point of age - and service being'given a higher status? And if he should note the fstCt isj hs likely to let it pass without eosmeftt? It nay be further noted that tke terns of the Resolution were not confidential ana the fact that differential treatment would be in the future accorded was published Xn the Press). 5, I* conclusion your petitioner would hunbly pray ta) That he may oe given equality of treatment in the 7 - f ^ ■ &lt;.v j .

Your petitioner submits that the tirindples of the ■jCheiae of Reorganisation as outlined in the 8nd Parafrraph of the above—mentioned Resolution, while merely sectirinp to the Military Officers introduced item the Punjab Com mission tJ-ie privileges they already possessed in their own Province, have tslaced your petitioner in a most humiliating position, in view of the fact that his uay '' m r- ' '*- T ' 1 and. pro ape o ts are so rouoh v/orse th^ji are 'thoae of the mnjab Idlitary Civilians vrho have been drawn from exactly the saae class as hir^xself. •3 # Your petitioner notiaes that in the Civil Cadre there are at least 16 ofxioera# with less Civil service than hiiiiaelf # praded in higher Glasses, one of whom is a r'olibiaal Afrent 5rd Glass (Provisional) two others are- officiating Political Apents of the 3nd Class and the remainder arcs ofiiciatinp Political Apents of the 3H| Class, while your petitioner cannot hope to rise to a hipher - omciatinc appointaent thnr. that of Political Arent i r * &gt;■ if ; . ;• i ;• ■I i 4 I i4th Class until 20 of his seniors on the General List have made wa^r for him by leaving the I/epartment. 4. Your petitioner submits that the chief reason for the slowness of ^ronotion amongst the Military Officers of the old Political department is the fact that so many gentlemen have been introduced at a comparatively late stage from other Services, accelerating as a rule the promotion in the Provinces or Departments which they have % left# while causing the utmost xaortification to the officers of the •'most varied and responsible service in the world* f whom they supersede. m 5. In your petitioner's case there are 16 officers who have thus been graded over his head on the old depart mental List# and if t,he services of all these gentlemen were indispensable on particular and special grounds, he subtests that an invitation xnifirht have been issued to the officers superseded, in turn, to transfer their services to the Department from which the intruder was being brought. In the oases of introductions from the i-'unjab and mrma Commissions there seems little doubt that such an invitation wojild have readily been accepted durinp the past few years by junior members of the Political Lepart- ment. 6. Your petitioner thereiore humbly prays (a) That he may be given equality of treatment in the Department with members of the Indian Civil Service as has bsen given to Military officers transferred from the J^unjab Commission. (b) That, if all the officers of the Department are to be brought on to one list, they may be classified strictly according to the date of their Civil service, and all further recruitments may be brought in at the bottom of- the list. But that, if two lists are to be maintained, your petitioners position on Dist B may be so improved as to bring him into the its: 1500/- grade and thus make him Eke. equal of his contemporaries in Civil service on List A, and to effect this last he can only sugrest that:-(i) the appointraents in 'the various grades may be redistiributecl # (ii) officers who have been anperseded by others in- troctuced from outside laay be given the option of tr^jisfer into the intruder's provincial service^ being graded according to the length of their service in Civil employ# (iii) enhanced pensions may be offered to induce officers* to retire before their time, ^or ivhich act of graciousness your petitioner v/ill^as in duty bound^ ever pray# m ■rn^m Hxtrr.c-c xrf.r. a ci-osci ..-iivorc- by Lor4 Cursor, at Sinla or. the 30tli S -Dtcr.bor It05, at 503 and 504 of 'Lord Cursor, in India' by ^ A.

Tlie question of the r\ppliccition of similar rules to the Political Depart ment lias been under consideration, and the Secretary of State has now decided that it should be definitely announced as a condition of service in the Political Department that he reserves to hiiaself the power, on the recommendation of the Government of India, to remove from service in the Department any officer who is proved to be unfit for fur they advancement. TUe amount of pension to be granted in each case of compulsory retirement will be determined by the Secretary of State with reference to the inerits of the particular case ; but it will ordinarily correspond, in the case of members Of the Indian Civil Service with the scale of invalid, annliities admissible to officers of that service who are forced to retire prematurely on account of ill-hcaUh, and in the case of military officers with the amount of retiring pension which an officer may have earned at the time under the regulations, ^o uniform method of procedure will be followed in all cases in which compulsory -retirement is proposed, but the essential condition of security of tenure will be secured by the following provisions (i) No officer shall be retired until he hns had full notice of the grounds on which inefficiency is alleged against him, and an opportunity of being heard in his defence. (2) No lower authority than the Secretary of State for India shall power to 'emove an officer from the service. have (3) Before the compulsory retireraeiTt of a military officer who is not on the supernumerary list is recommeniied to the Secretary'of State, lie shall he given the option of reverting to military duty, provided that the Comm vnder-in-Chief is willing to receive him back. 3.
