His Highness has raised some objection to the reply given to him on the ground that the aerodrome in question was built primarily for Imperial Airways. He stated in conversation that he had only referred the matter to me as a matter of courtesy and that he hoped it would be possible to modify the reply given to him so as to leave him free to permit T.V..A. to use the aerodrome regularly should they wish to do so. He added that the Royal Air Force would always 'have priority” in his territories and that he would not permit the use of Shinas by foreign air lines, to interfere with the right of the Royal Air Force to use it as an emergency landing ground as before. 3. From my records there appears little doubt that the Shinas landing ground was constructed for civil purposes. The Political Agent's letter No.C/169 dated the 22nd July, 1933, requesting formal permission for its construction v/as referred by the Council of Regency to the Sultan. The latter replied in letter of the 8th November 1933, to the Political Agent: 'You have not mentioned in your letter whether it is required for Government or some other Companys aeroplanes. I will send you an answer as soon as I hear about this point from you.' r The following is an extract from the Political Agent's letter No.C/216 dated the 23rd November, 1933,^ in reply. 'As regards the Shinas landing ground, this place is primarily intended as a forced landing ground in case of emergency for any mail aeroplanes of Imperial Airways Company that during adverse winds in the monsoon season cannot reach Shargah from Gwadur. Such use would of course only be made in case of grave emergency as Shinas itself is considerably to the south of the direct route of the Gwadur-Shargah line and the landing ground itself is very small for the use of the big aircraft used by Impierial Airways.' In this connection reference is invited to the enclosures to Residency printed letter No.904-S dated 24th July, 1933.► - ki - c uo /ould suggest 10. 4. In these circumstances I for your consideration!that a fMrtherj communication be sent to His Highnes^y—seating that there is no objection to the use of the Shinas landing ground by T.V..A, provided the Royal Air Force continue to enjoy the right to use it for emergency purposes as before. It is assumed that we are not interested in this landing ground for civil aircraft.\ jb •* - - m - 'T 1 6T30 Telegram From To G.T.C. i Political JtTesident, Bahrain. Political Agent, Muscat. No.1041.

I have today received the following message from His Highness the Sultan, (sent to me in cypher telegram by the Muscat Agency office). 'Following for Political Agent from Sultan begins : We have received a cable from American Consul, Dhahran stating that T.W.A. plans proving flight in about three weeks to India using route to be our territory (mutilation). He requests that at Shinas, if feasible, to investigate situation there and other possible air ports in our territory and whether Shinas will be usable and ? date (mutilation) or whether other landing area preferable. To enable us to answer him shall be pleased if you will let us know if there is any objection existing to Shinas ground being used according to above request. For our part we have no objection to their request. Of course if they decide that flights and landings are to be regular in our territory an air agreement will have to be drawn up afterwards. Said. Ends.' 3. I have not the relevant files with me to show whether the Shinas landing ground was constructed for Royal Air Force or for civil purposes, but assume that in either case we now' have no interest in its development.

'when I approached His Highness for the required facilities he immediately expressed suprise that the Government of tne United States had not seen fit to address him on this subject and stated that it would be very difficult for him to give any answer, especially in view of the reply he had given in regard to a similar approach made to him concerning the operations of an American survey party last year. Being certain that, given time, His Highness* good sense would lead him to a more satisiactory attitude, i contented myself with observing tnat as tne request for air facilities was being made on behalf of the United States Government, who themselves had no representative at Muscat, i could see no particular grounds i or his concern over the method of approach and that i hoped he would give the matter his consideration. Pour days later His Highness visited me at the Agency to discuss the matter further and asked my advice on the reply he should give, his only reference to the method of approach being an enquiry as to whether 1 saw any objection to his drawing attention to this in his reply. During tne interview His Highness expressed his intention of following the general principles in regard to international Avia,tion, agreed upon at the Chicago Conference of 1944. His Highness asked for time to xni study the Chiaago Agreements witn the result that ms reply was not received until yesterday. 3. iesterday a party of American officials, which included a Vice-Consul from their uhahran Consulate, arrived at Muscat by air for discussion with His Highness concerning the disposal oi American equipment at lias ir ah and Salalah and it is possible, ^ though^ i think improbable, that His Highness may have mentioned tne suoject to the American Vice-Consul. it may be of interest ^ to note that in recent conversation with me, His Highness stated ^ - that until Mr. Parker Hart, tne American Consul at Dhahran lnforraed him verb ally on the 14th April tn is year that Muscat l faY'W'ir was ^ nG l u( ^ e( i i- n bis Consular area, he was under the impression that the .American interests in Muscat were in the charge of the American Consul at Bombay.

With the concurrence of the Foreign Office and the Air Ministry, the local Political Authorities were authorised to re-open negotiations with the Sheikh on the lines approved on P.Z.3902. The negotiations were conducted by Captain T. Hickinbotham, the Officiating Political Agent at Bahrein, and he is to be congratulated on having succeeded in ootaining all the facilities required on the minimum authorised terms. Captain Hickinbotham 1 s report on the negotiations, together with (a) the text of the Agreement, and (b) copies of letters exchanged with the Sheikh in connection with the recognition of his independence, form enclosures to Colonel Loch's letter of the 21st September. (P.Z.7109/36 - flag B). The Agreement itself contains six clauses, viz. 5,6,7, 10,11 and 12, which were included at the instance of the Sheikh. In his covering letter Colonel Loch states that he considers that these additional clauses are not harmful, and this opinion is endorsed by Colonel Fowle in his Note o^ the 7th September (flag C). {JUMMAto, (/o reason^for dissenting from the viev/s expressed by these officials and it is submitted that the action taken by Captain Hickinbotham be confirmed. So much for the Agreement. With regard to the exchange of letters, it will be observed that in consideration of the recognition of his independence the Sheikh has furnished a written undertaking to observe the terms and conditions /*e scribed in the Treaties and Agreements at present binding on the Sheikh of Sharjah and other Trucial Sheikhs. Here again Captain Hickinbotham is to be congratulated on having obtained the Sheikh's/Sheikh's undertaking within the terms of his instructions. The gift of ammunition which is referred to in paragraph 4 of Captain Hickinbotham 1 s report need not be objected to. The Sheikh attaches particular importance to the grant of a gun salute, and in his telegram of the 21st September (P.Z.6830/36 - flag F) the Political Resident recommends that he should be granted a personal salute of three guns, which should be fired as soon as possible in order to show the local world that we have, in fact, recognised his independence. The proposal to grant a gun salute was approved in principle on P. Z. 3902/36, and, with the approval of the Foreign Office and the Admiralty, a draft submission to the King is submitted for approval. The Political Resident suggests that the question cf making this salute dynastic should be taken up later as there are various local considerations which must be taken into account. yuUAlllfo l jfib SodutT of lUtUAs)u \/icA*a.

Lord Zetland presents his humble duty to Your Majesty and has the honour to submit that Your Majesty may be graciously pleased to approve that the Sheikh of Kalba, in the region of the Persian Gulf, may be granted a personal salute of three guns. Kalba is situated on the Eastern coast of Trucial Oman and is about half my between Bahrein and Gwadar on the direct air route to India; considerable importance is attached to the establishment of an emergency landing site at that place. As a result of recent negotiations the Sheikh of Kalba has consented to provide facilities for this purpose and in consideration of the recognition of his independence he has undertaken to observe the terms and conditions prescribed in the Treaties and Agreements at present binding upon other Sheikhs of Trucial Oman.

Permission for the air facilities required - that is to say for a landing ground, beacon, two moorings, a petrol store and a shelter for passengers - has been obtained. 3. Clauses 5, 6, 7, 10, 11 and 12 have been included at the instance of the Shaikh. They are not harmful and I think that, had the Political Agent not accepted them without hesitation, the success of the negotiations would have been prejudiced. 4. I am asking the Air Officer Commanding, British Porces in ♦Iraq, to arrange for the eleven rifles mentioned in Clause 13 of the Agreement and (see paragraph 4 of the Political Agent*s letter) for two hundred rounds of ammunition for each rifle / £E@d.

There is no mention that I have heen ahle to trace of the Shaikh of Sharjah being informed of this decision. Prohahly he was hound volume that Kalha and the other Jowasmi Settlements on the Oman Coast were, at one time, part of Sharjah. In the course of the 19th century the ruling Shaikh of Sharjah alienated these dependencies, giving Dihha to one of his brothers and Kalha to another. The children of these brothers succeeded their fathers in the course of time, holding their possessions piiiiiaiArngijfFy in fief, hut the influence of the Shaikh of Sharjah has decreased in the course of time and they are, therefore, to all intents and purposes independent. The fact that Kalha v/as originally subject to the Shaikh of Sharjah is not, I think, necessarily a reason for refusing to recognise the independence of the Shaikh of Kalha at the present moment. Ras-al-Khaimah v/as also at one time part of Sharjah, hut this has not prevented us from recognising the independence of its Shaikh. If it is advantageous v/hether of Muscat*Government of India decided in favour not. It is clear from Sir Percy Cox’s minute in the2. for us to recognise the independence of Kalha I doubt vestiges of Sharjah sovereignty. We should, however, clearly draw the attention of the Political Resident to the matter, withparticular reference to the assurance given in the covering letter to the Sharjah Air Agreement and we might, perhaps, also add a sentence to the draft letter to the Air Ministry saying that the Political Resident will he consulted in the matter. if M UcJiyiA* Ati ^ cl* V) )yviX oJLJr'tt . A 'Ctto, hft- whether we need te deterred -fay the rather shadowy K f&gt;'/ Minute Paper POLITICAL Department. 'V In connection with the establishment^ of Arab air route, Imperial Airways anxious to secure an emergency landing ground on the East side of the Musandam Peninsula. Kalba v/as fixed upon as the most suitable point, and overtures were accordingly made to the Sheikh with a view to obtaining the desired facilities. The Sheikh’s response was, however, unfavourable and he refused to enter into any agreement, with the result that up to now no facilities have been obtained. Attention is invited to the papers immediately below on the file from which it will be seen that the Sheikh's attitude has changed and that he has at last agreed to grant the desired facilities. These consist of a landing ground, petrol store, a house for airmen and passengers, mooring for flying boats and a beacon. In return he has formulated certain demands, some written and some verbal. He is clearly out to make the most of his opportunity, and, with the example of Sharjah before him, his demands are likely to be high. As Colonel Fowle points out, our requirements at Kalba, with the exception of the house for airmen and passengers, are similar to those obtained from the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi: see the Agreement at P.Z.1471/35 (permission to construct a beacon at Abu Dhabi was obtained subsequently without further payment). The sum of Rs.400 per mensem in respect of rent of landing ground, petrol store, mooring,^ beacon aiid/gil/ards would therefore seem to be reasonable, % whether it is paid comprehensively or divided into | separate items for rental and guards. The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi was paid, in addition, a lump sum of Rs.5000, This payment v/as described in the Agreement as a token of 3939 5000 7/35 friendship/! r r friendship and good will, but it was actually payment of arrears in respect of a tank at Yas Island which had been installed four years previously, so the need for a similar payment in the case of Kalba does not arise. On the other hand, in the case of Kalba construction will presumably be necessary in order to have the house for the passengers and pilots, and the Sheikh will presumably expect an additional rent in respect of these buildings, and possibly some advance payment for their construction. Tnere is further the question of a subsidy which is demanded on the analogy of Sharjah. The extent to which the Air Ministry are prepared to meet the Sheikh's demands presumably depends upon the value which they attach to tne facilities obtained, and it seems therefore desirable to consult them in the first instance. U JlS re S ar&lt;is the remainder of the Sheikh's demands, which are concerned with assurances rather than with finance, ^he lolitical Resident's suggestion that we should give a written undertaking on the lines of that given to the Sheikh of Sharjah appears to be suitable, we have no desire to interfere with the domestic affairs of the Sheikhdom, and we can presumably promise to assist him in the event of serious attack. There does not seem to be any strong objection to recognising his independence. Kalba * •'** ^ ; was, admittedly, recognised ■ in 1903 as belonging to j Snarjah, but it is not clear whether this ruling was ever communicated to the Sheikh of Sharjah, and, in any case, the latter has never had any effective control over the region for some years. As regards the gun salute, the Political Resident's suggestions in para. 4 of his telegram below seem suitable. A draft letter consulting the Air Ministry on the various aspects of the question is submitted. ^ 1Minute Paper. Department. All the proposals appear to he in accordance Y/ith precedent, i.e. the Sharjah and/or Ahu Dhabi cases, except of course the proposal to recognise the Sheikh of Kalba as ''independent”. The fact that we have teen negotiating with the Sheikh of Kalha is in itself a kind of recognition that he is independent, and it appears that in practice the Sheikh of Sharjah has no control. On the other hand, the fact that Kalba was recognised as part of Sharjah in 1903, coupled with the assurance in / paragraph 2 of Colonel Dickson’s letter of 22nd July 1932 to the Sheikh of (P. Z. i|.664/32 in the bound volume) might on the face of it give the Sheikh of Sharjah ground for asserting that in recognising the independence of the Sheikh of Kalba we v/ere violating the 1932 assurance. It might be well to say, in any telegram of approval to the Resident, that we assume he is satisfied that this is not a practical possibility. The commitment involved in an agreement to support Kalba in any attack from his neighbours would, of course, be a fresh commitment, and might (e.g. if he were attacked by his neighbour of Fujairah) involve coercive action either from the air or the sea. But , it must clearly be faced. It v/ould, of course, be confined - as in the case of Sharjah - to attack arising out of the Agreement now entered into* Jt Lk? lriu\ farH /) Ctfvv% U* fay /yUa/SA*-? &gt;» OA/htiA* ^ // ^ CLcy^yitu** (du* &lt;d~ ^ ^ 3939 5000 7/35Minute Paper.

The outstanding questions are those mentioned in paras. 6 and 7 of the express letter of 22nd Lay (addressed, rather curiously, to the A.O.C.) and in the telegram of 6 th June. Perhaps the most important of these is whether we should recognise the 'independence' of Kalba. As regards the position of Kalba vis -a- vis Sharjah, please see Lord Hood’s separate note of 17th June below. We have ascertained that Col. Fowle is satisfied that there is no objection to recognising independence , notwithstanding the 4 ^-vAy ^ p£ assurance given to the Sheikh of Sharjah in para. 2 of Col.

It will be observed that the Sheikh of Kalba is now more favourably disposed towards granting the air facilities desired by the Air Ministry, and that the Political Resident is accordingly pursuing negotiations v/ith the Sheikh with a view to concluding an Agreement m the near future. It is understood that Mr. Hickinbotham and a R.A.F. officer are visiting Kalba to confirm the facilities required and discuss with the Sheikh the question of payment in respect of rental and guards, x ~ 4 oi A I am to enquire whether the^Air Ge^n^iir agrees that the Sheikh may be informed as proposed in para. 2 of the Pol.

F.O. and A.M. v/ould propose to deal as follows v/ith the remaining questions raised m paras. 6 and 7 of the Pol. Resident’s express letter of 22nd May and in his telegram/telegram of 6 th June. There would seem to be no objection to authorising the Resident to address a letter to the Sheikh dealing in the manner suggested with the points mentioned in para. 6 of that express letter, so far as they have been raised or may be raised by the Sheikh. H.L. further sees no objection to making a gift of rifles to the Sheikh, should they be asked for; and he agrees with the Pol. Resident as to the attitude to be taken towards the Sheikh’s request for a gun salute. Lord Zetland also suggests that recognition of the independence of the Sheikh might be conveyed to him either orally or in the letter suggested above. It has been ascertained that, in view of the fact that the Sheikh of Sharjah has for many years had no control over Kalba, Col. Fowle is satisfied that there is no objection to this course, as the assurance given to the Sheikh of Sharjah in para. 2 of Col. Dickson's letter of 22nd July, 1932, could not be held to apply. Another point, however, which seems deserving of consideration is whether recognition of the independence of Kalba should not be made conditional on the Sheikh accepting m terms all the treaty obligations at present binding the Sheikh of Sharjah, for instance, the Exclusive Agreement 7IS • Draft Paper. 4794 5000 5.36 Department.

To - The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Landing Ground at Kalba . Sir, XXX XX XX 2. After the usual exchange of calls I explained the requirements of His Majesty’s Goverminent to the Shaikh. He asked if I was informing him of the whole of the requirements because he said when negotiations were first considered a petrol store and landing ground were the only requirements and the beacon and moorings etcetera were additional. I assured him that as far as I knew I was giving him a complete list of the facilities that His Majesty’s Government hoped to obtain. The Shaikh then stated that there was no objection to these facilities being granted. 3. xx x xx xx XXX XXX X It is desirable to mention that the Shaikh is an old man who has not been into the world. He has performed the pilgrimage which has been his only excursion outside his own area as far as I could ascertain. He was very nervous and obviously afraid of committing himself in any way. He was shy and most unwilling to discuss any point or give any answer without consultation with his friend Haji Ahmad, xxxxxxxx X X- 2 - It would be tedious to describe the course of the arguments, but after prolonged conversations he gave his terms as stated in his letter. In addition to his written request he made several Verbal requests which I have noted below. The Shaikh's written requests are for:- (a) guarantee for non-interference in his domestic affairs and the government of his country, (b) constructions to be his property (he has introduced this on the analogy of the Sharjah agreement;, (c) rent for ground and moorings, (d) a charge for buildings. In addition to the written terms noted above the Shaikh mentioned the following conditions verbally: ^a) Recognition of independence and a gun salute. (b) Guards. (c) Assistance in the event of a serious attack. He is particularly desirous of being recognised and having a salute fired when he visits a warship. I gathered that he was afraid of being absorbed by Muscat. x x x x ^ ^ In regard to the guards. I do not think that a large demand will be made because things are fairly quiet now, but at the same time although the Shaikh is not afraid of a definite attack he is afraid of pilfering of Government property for which he would probably be neld responsible. The Sharqiyin are not actively aggressive and the Shaikh is averse to taking any definite action against them for minor misdeeds. He would rather pay them to leave him in peace. 5. I consider that it is desirable to have the details of the air facilities required as soon as possible i.e. the /)X&gt; -3- the position of the beacon, type of accommodation for passengers, size of petrol store, and the number and position of seaplane moorings. The seaplane moorings may be difficult to arrange as fishing rights will have to be considered. Severe winds blow, the coast is quite open, and there is often a heavy swell which may make moorings impracticable. The advice of an officer of the Royal Air Force is essential as it will be a waste of valuable time to negotiate for facilities which for practical reasons will be useless. 6. I left with the understanding that I would return in three weeks* time, possibly with an officer of the Royal Air Force, and that the terms would be finally settled. In the meantime the Shaikh will consult Haji Ahmad and in order to facilitate the consultation I have instructed Khan Sahib Husain bin Hasan Amad to send him to Kalba. I have also told Khan Sahib Husain to point out to the Haji that the Shaikh’s demands must be reasonable and that the more reasonable they are the more likely are they to be acceded to* 7. In conclusion I wish to mention how very helpful Commander C.F.B.Bowlby of His Majesty’s Ship Deptford has been in assisting the negotiation in every way possible. Medical facilities were provided and several serious cases were treated by Surgeon Lieutenant Cooke and drugs and medical supplies were given to the Shaikh. I have the honour to be.

With reference to our conversation of yesterday, I have informed you that the Government require permission for: (1) A landing ground (2) Godown for petrol C3; House for airmen and passengers (4) Moorings for flying boats (5) A beacon. You informed me verbally that you would agree to the construction and erection of the above in your country. I have asked you to let me know the terms you wanted and you mentioned verbally that you cannot give me a definite answer in the absence of Haji Ahmad bin Hasan but probably you may require:- ! 1) Rent for the buildings 2) A subsidy for yourself 3j Guards 4) Protection if anything unusual happens. You cannot also say the amount of money and the number of guards required by you in the absence of Haji Ahmad bin Hasan. I understand that you have another thing which you mentioned to me verbally. I have also understood that il I return after three weeks you will have discussed the matter with your friend and you will be ready to settle it. I shall be glad to know if I understood the things correctly. Usual ending. sd.

Hickinbotham, Political Agent, Bahrain. After compliments, I have received your esteemed letter and understood contents. With regard to our conversation of yesterday in connection with the Government object to construct for the aeroplanes as necessity arises namely Landing ground, godown for petrol, house for passengers when alighted from the aeroplane, a beacon for aeroplanes guidance at night, moorings one or two through which no damage is sustained by us. There is no objection. I woula agree if you agree to the terms which I require from the Government. That a certain charge should be paid for each thing. As for money and arms this will be agreed upon later. That Government should leave us in our liberty and independence and not to interfere in our country’s affairs. That all constructed on our ground would be our property and under our control. This will be governed by other terms which will be mentioned in the presence of our friend Haji Ahmad bin Hasan because he was the man who entered into negotiation with me in this connection. He should be present also you and Khan Sahib Husain bin Hasan Amad. If the terms are granted then the matter will be settled in your presence and those mentioned above after three weeks from this date. Usual ending.COSTOffiSOAL. GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. Department.

As regards Kalba and Chinas, while we do not wish to press the point if you and the A.O.C. feel strongly about it, we should, I think, in the interest of giving the Resident a comprehensive schedule which will place on record information as to the importance from the civil and strategic standpoints respectively of the various facilities required, be disposed, until we have got the facilities we want at Kalba to omit in the case of that site, the reference to Imperial Airways in Col. 5 in the amended list enclosed in your letter to Johnstone of the Foreign Office dated 11th October No. 3.32395 (copies of which were sent to India and Bushire by the Air Mail of 24th November and 1st December respectively) retaining however the existing reference in Col. 6 of that list. In the case of Shinas we would for the present retain the existing references in Columns 5 and 6.

It will be remembered that difficulty has arisen about the provision of an emergency landing ground at Kalba. Last September (P.Z.5602/33) the Political Resident reported that the P.A. Muscat suggested as an alternative Shinas, in Muscat territory, where 'there is flat ground, close to Wall’s Port.' The Air Ministry at that time thought that Shinas was too far south ana that its acceptance would involve too great a diversion from the normal route. From their letter of 14th July, on P.Z.4162/ 33, it will be seen that, in view of the delay in obtaining emergency facilities at Kalba and of the difficulties (largely, I understand, due to the use of an unsuitable type of aeroplane) with which Imperial Airways are faced owing to the absence of any intermediate emergency landing ground between Gwadur and Shargah, they are now anxious after all to use Shinas. They have given an undertaking that this will not involve (cf. Air Ministry letter of 18th July attached) flights across any part of the Mussandim Pens insula south of the line Dibba : Ras-al-Khaimah. 2. The Air Staff have urged privately that we should give any assistance possible in this matter. Apparently for strategic reasons there is much to be said for the provision of the necessary landing ground. 3. I submit that we may telegraph to the Government of India and the Resident as In the draft attached. * L CtA (X ^ ^ ' Uf . xj-U .33rz ^UL li 7 Copies to A.M.

I received an assurance from him that his Company fully appreciate the strong objections to any flights across the base of the Mussandim Peninsula.

In some cases aircraft had only been able to make Shargah from Gwadar with a few minutes petrol left in the tanks. Will you please, therefore, as a matter of urgency ask the India Office to get the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to have the ground at Shinas made available for use in emergency.^ 2.

The attached mutilated message was received from the Political Resident, through the Political Agent, Muscat. Captain Alban, however, was able to put me ’au fait* with the situation. Negotiations have been proceeding for some time with the Sheikh of Kalba to establish an emergency Landing Ground and Petrol Dump, lor Imperial Airways, just outside Kalba. Several visits have been paid to the Sheikh of Kalba (H.M.S. 'BIDEFORD' visited Kalba on 4th September with Captain Alban) and on each occasion the Sheikh has refused to have ar&amp;thing to do with the matter despite being offered a subsidy. Fujaira and Kalba are always on unfriendly terms and the former claim all the territory round Kalba (at present owned by Kalba and where the proposed site for Landing Ground is situated). It was considered by the Political Resident that the visit of a Sloop to Fujaira, whose presence could be clearly seen by Kalba, might force the Sheikh of the latter place to agreeing to the proposed Landing Ground. 15. 'BIDEFORD' arrived at Fujaira at 0900 on Wednesday, 23rd November. Interpreter was sent ashore on arrival and proceeded to Fujaira (which is situated 2^ miles inland)• The Sheikh is 85 and a very sick man. He is practically bed-ridden. At 1600 I, and two officers landed and rode on donkeys to Fujaira to call on the Sheikh. He was very pleased to see us and gave us a courteous reception. No mention was made to him of the reason for our visit. I merely/merely told him that I had dropped in on my way from Muscat to Henjam. 16.

'( it will be remembered that Imperial Airways are anxious to secure an emergency laming ground (which they I think it might be necessary to use so rarely as perhaps once in a year) on the east side of the Lussandim Peninsula. Kalba, in the territory of an independent Sheikh, has been fixed on as the most suitable point and it has proved impossible to find any really satisfactory alternative* Our original approaches to the Sheikh for the necessary facilities were well received, but when it came to concluding a definite agreement he took fright (or else pressure was brought to bear on him, as seems likely, from the Trucial Sheikhs) and refused to grant any facilities whatsoever* It was decided that the objections to coercing the Sheikh were very strong am that we should continue to endeavour to win him over by peaceful means. The failure of our second effort is reported in the Political Resident*s telegram of 20th January on P.Z.426/33. 2 * We may agree with the Resident and the Government of India as to tne objections to employing force against the Sheikh. I understand from the Service side of the Air ministry that they would see no very strong objection to leaving matters as they are at present in the hope that in the near future the Sheikh may adopt a less intransigent attitude. It appears that an air liner in real emergency could always land if necessary at Kalba, where there is a |Stretch of sand which requires no preparation, and I i gather that a report has been received to the effect that/that Lurair (last paragraph of resident's telegram) is quite unsuitable, the ground being too soft to bear any heavy weight, while 3hinas is considered to lie too far out of the track of Imperial Airways. We may, however, find the Civil side of the Air Ministry pressing for further action to overcome the Sheikh's reluctance to meet us. 3.

I have the honour to refer to correspondence ending with Inaia office telegram No.2538 of 1st October 1932, ana to report tnat I have taken action with the object of obtaining from tae Shaikh of Kalba the required emergency fanning grouna in his territory. in Iraq, Baghdad, that Captain Lackuy, the Royal Engineer Officer in charge of the builaing of the Rest House at Chargah, more conciliatory uttituue with re gum to granting the air facilities requirea from him. It woula have been open to me to possible - to make mre that he woula not receive a second missions to Arab Shaikhs, with requests for air - or other - facilities, only to have their requests refusea, while on further negotiations more difficult. The Shaikh in question gets wina in the heaa from the fact that he has been able to Hum aown' a British officer, ana having done so not unnaturally his attituae hardens. He finds it difficult to retreat from the position he has taken up, ana will only ao so - unless under threat of compulsion - unaer cover of exorbitant 2 . I received a telegram from the Air Officer Commanding particular grounds such a contra temps only serves to render emends. Unfortunately two cases of such rebuffs to officershuve occurred in trie lc*st two months: to the Political Agent, Bahrain, at Qatar, ana to the Political Ajent, muscat, at Kalha. 3. In oraer to avoid, if it is practicable, such incidents in the future I propose, when air - or other - facilities are required from Shaikhs, to adopt a procedure used with some success in ureas outside trie Gulf where I have served; to find out beforehand oy means of unofficial - or demi-official - 'representatives’ 1 what reception the Shaikh concerned is likely to give to the proposal. An Arab Shaikh is more likely to reveal - in the first Instance at ail events - the tortuous workings of his -frabian mind to a fellow Arab than to a British officer. Once these preliminary soundings have been taken, ana I am more or less au fait with what is the Shaikh’s attitude on the subject, as well as that of his relatives ana tribesmen, the question of sending a Political officer to open official negotiations can be considered. These methods may seem protracted but with the Arab often ’’the longest way round is the shortest way home', ana it is obvious that when an officer finally visits ct Shaikh, after this preliminary reconnaissance has been made, he aoes so with the decided advantage of knowing previously how the land lies. 1 would xhave liked to adopt these methods in trie case of .„atur ana before the Political Agent's first visit to Kalba, but time aid not permit, ana of course if on any future occasion long notice is not possible and no preliminary sounaings can be taken, a political officer will have to be sent in a hurry to open negotiations ana tame the risk of a rebuff. 4. In tne present instance after receiving the information from the air Officer Commanuing in Iraq noted above, ana confirmation from the Secretary of State for India that Kalba was still required as an emergency landing round, I instructed the Residency Agent, Snargah, to ask the shaikh of that place, wnoin I oelieve to have some influence with the3. (3 Shaikh of Kalha, to send a trustworthy representative to the latter with a view to sounaing him on the subject. The representative auly starteu overlano. for Kalha hut unfortunately coula not 0 et tnrougn owing to some Beaouin inter-tribal fighting, ana had to return to Shargah. Hie Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, has very kinaly arranged that he should he taken by a sloop to Kalha in a few days. I would have preferred the representative tcjhave proceeded by himself under no official auspices whatever, hut it is certainly much better that he should reach Kalha somehow than not at all* On the receipt of the representative’s report I will consider the matter of sending the Political Agent, Luscat, once again to Kaiha.

TIT r\T3-n» Mr 0 Laithwaite circulated an alternative draft telegram to the Government of India and the Political Resident which had been prepared in the India Office. MroRendel explained that the meeting had been convened as the simplest method of dealing with the departmental differences which had disclosed themselves on the question of the action to be taken in regard to the proposed emergency landing ground at Kalba 0 The general views of the Foreign Office had been set out in his demi- official letter of 13th September to the India Office of which copies had gone to the interested Departments© To these views the Foreign Office adheredo While they were ' less strictly concerned with this question than the other Departments present they regarded the matter as one which called for careful handling, and for this reason had felt hesitation about the original draft 0 The further India Office draft appeared, broadly speaking, unobjectionable from the Foreign Office point of view,, but it seemed questionable ./aether we might not do better to have a rather fuller survey of the case with a view, if possible 0 to securing a site for tne landing ground in Muscat territory CoIoEo 0 OoBoE© Air Ministry© Captain J©HoD©Cunningham Director of Plans M 0 V© 0©,RnJJ© Admiralty 0 Mr 0 JoGoLaithwaite India Office© CaptainCaptain Cunnln^haTn said that the First Lord had not originally appreciated that it would be necessary to enter into conmitinents with Sheikhs other than the Sheikh of Shargah and that there had been no specific reference to K&amp;lba in the conclusions in M*E,M.15 which had been approved by the Oabineto The Air Ministry moreover had emphasised in paragraph 20 of that paper that the aeroplanes to ba employed should have sufficient reserve power in emergency to return to their Sheikdom such as Shargah. Apart from this he wished to point out that the Admiralty were being asked to keep a sloop at Shargah for some four months after the landing ground there came into use; that the Sheikh of Qatar had recently indicated that he wished for the support of His Majesty's Government against his relations, and the Sheikh of Kalba might now make a similar request. The Admiralty were not very easy at the extra commitments superimposed on the normal routine of the Gulf sloops which there seemed to be some risk of our taking on, and would much prefer that the proposed emergency landing ground, if the necessity for it was accepted, should be in Muscat territory, where the problem of protection would be easier. The Air Ministry doubted if Kalb a would in faot represent a real additional commitment. But in any case the problem of an alternative was a serious one. The situation of Dibba was excellent, but the technical objections to it appeared insuperable. Between Dibba and the tip of the /j/ Musandim Peninsula there was no possible site. The farther south one went the greater the diversion from the normal route and so the less the practical value of any facilities secured. This was a substantial objection to Shinas. The Air Ministry were definitely of opinion that Kalba was on the whole the best place for a landing ground. They were equally clear that in the interests of tho safety of the passengers by the starting point or land either at some safe emergency landing ground such as Yas, or on the coast within some friendlyair route it was desirable that an enorgency landing ground of the nature now under consideration should be provided on the east side of the Musandim Peninsulao It was not contemplated that it should be frequently used ^ in fact. It miglit be used so rarely as once a year 0 But It was necessary that it should be there 0 In reply to enquiries the fforeIpn Office intimated that while they would much prefer that aircraft in distress should not make forced landings on Persian soil, in view of the possibility of difficulties with Persia, and had In fact in the course of the previous discussion laid considerable stress on the possibility of such difficulties, the risk of such landings haring to be made on Persian territory in cases of real emergency had always been contemplated, and it had been agreed that it would be necessary to accept it if the Arabian route was to be adoptedo fflTo Lalthwalte sail that it appeared from certain remarks made by the Air Ministry representative that they conten 5 &gt;lated that tne civil air route should cross the Musandim Peninsula and not fly around it 0 fie desired formally to reiterate the very strong objection seen by the India Office to flights of this nature in any part of the Peninsula &gt; an objection based on the political difficulties in which we might find ourselves involved in the event of a crash in the hinterland in an area amenable nei ther to our control nor to that of the Sultan of Mascato There was the further difficulty that if we ourselves flew across the peninsula, it would be difficult ultimately to refuse permission to do so to foreign aircrafto Beference had been made to the question at the interdepartmental conference of 19th July, and it was important that there should be no misunderstanding about ito Captain Cunningham raI that the Admiralty had consistently assumed that there would be no flights across the Musardim Peninsula, to which they wouldsee strong objection. The Air Ministry representatives said that they had not been aware that the point had fomed the O, subject of previous consideration. It was agreed after discussion that as it did not arise directly in connection with the present telegram it was unnecessary to consider it further for the moment. After further discussion the meeting agreed (in the case of the Admiralty subject to the concurrence of higher authority) to a draft on the general lines of that circulated by the India Office, subject to verbal modifications proposed in the second paragraph by the Foreign Office.

The Foreign Office were very reluctant to concur in the draft instructions, though these were acceptable to the Air Ministry (see Mr. Rendel's d.o. letter of 13th September) and the Admiralty also found themselves unable to agree to the acceptance of a policy which might result in the necessity for adopting coercive measures against the Sheikh of Kalba ( without ministerial approval. As the result of informal discussion with the Departments concerned a revised draft telegram was prepared and considered at an interdepartmental meeting held at the Foreign Office yesterday. Draft Minutes of this meeting are flagged. The Foreign Office and the Air Ministry concurred in the draft and the Admiralty have since telephoned that they also concur. I submit that it may be authorised for issue. It avoids any threat of compulsion and gives the Government of India and the Resident an opportunity of commenting on the attitude to be adopted if we are unfortunately unable to secure our desiderata by peaceful methods.

(S 4GS0/96/91) FOMIGN OFITICB, 3.W.1 13th September* 19 32 Bear Donaldson, On return from leave I have just seen your letter of September 9th to Baxter about the suggested emergency landing ground at Kalba. your meeting at the Air Ministry on September 9th, I confess that we do not feel at all easy about the line suggested in the draft telegram you enclose. I realise of course that you are to some extent leaving the decision to the Government of India* and that part of the object of the proposed telegram is to mahe it clear to the Political Resident that His Majesty's Government do in fact attach serious importance to obtaining the desired facilities at halba. On the other hand, the telegram definitely says that His Majesty’s Government, notvjith- standing the recommendation of the Resident to the contrary, While we do not know exactly what passed at li.p* Donaldson, lisq2 ol- ««&gt; contrary, as expressed in Ills telegrani No.54:9 of* September 5th, consider that the Sheikh of Kalba should he pressed, and if necessary compelled , to agree to the establishment oi the emergency landing ground* The telegram in fact implies that His Majesty*s Government for their part, (although subject to the views of the Government of India) are pre pared to adopt a policy towards this question wnich will very likely involve forcibly coercing the Sheikh, with all its attendant political risks and consequences. These consequences will fall more within your province and that of the Admiraloy tnan within ours, out we have been so closely concerned with the whole question of the development of the Arab Air Houte that I do not hesitate to express quite freely our misgivings, ^ore especially as you have now kindly consulted us about the draft telegram which you propose to send to India. The consequences of embarking on a policy possi bly involving coercion may be extremely serious. Once we have committed ourselves to demanding the desired facilitiesfacilities from the Sheikh, it will hardly he possiole to draw hack without considerable loss of prestige, not only at halha, hut on the whole Trucial Coast. If there fore we are to take the proposed line at all iu seems clear that we must he prepared to see it through. This may mean 'bombarding a fort or even a village, and it is difficult to see where such measures would end, particu larly as we shall he acting not, as we were in ohe case of Khasah and in other previous cases, merely to re-estahlish the authority of a legitimate ruler, hut in order to secure a special concession for ourselves xor which we have no strict legal right to ask. Surely any attempt wo obtain by force the concession we require from the Sheikh might lead to considerable difficulties elsewhere on the Trucial Coast, since we know that the majority of the Trucial chiefs are already very suspicious of our intentions in establishing the Air Boute, and they may easily regard forcible action against the Sheimh of Kalba as the prelude to similar action against themselves, and thus he led to adopt an even more hostile attitude thanr than they have adopted hitherto* Ought not all theoe points to he very fully re-examined before the Government of India are given so strong a lead (as you propose to give them in your telegram) in favour of forcible action. The matter has not yet been submitted to our oecrecj-ry of State but I question whether Sir John Simon would be prepared to concur in the policy advocated without a reference oj&gt; the whole matter to the Cabinet, or at ...east to the Ministerial Middle East Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence. A second point is this, are we on really safe ground in ruling out so categorically all possibility of an alternative site in Muscat territory, where we should of co’arse be in an infinitely stronger position politically to obtain any reasonable concessions which we might desire? My definite recollection is that at the meeting ac which we discussed the question of the Dutch enquiry about facilities for the Dutch air service along the Arabian Coast, Laithwaite laid some stress on the importance, from the point of view of the India Office and of the Government ofof India, of all civil aircraft (including those of Imperial Airways) flying round the point of the Oman peninsula and not cutting across its base. My impression was indeed that the Air Ministry's representatives had said that there were teclinical objections to flying over the mountains of the peninsula. If the Air Boute is to go round the peninsula, is not Kalba too far South to be of real value as an emergency landing ground, and is not what is required something in the piece of Muscat terri tory lying to the North of it? If, on the other hand, the present intention is that Imperial Airways should fly across the Oman peninsula at its base, would it not be possible to find a point South of Kalba and on the Muscat coast (which in this area appears to have considerable stretches of flat country) which would be eaually suitable? As far as I can see from our maps, the Muscat frontier is only a few miles Soutn of Kaloa, and, as I have said above, our political position vis-h-/is the Sultan of Muscat is infinitely more favourable than our political position vis-a-vis the Trucial Sheihhs. V/hilePs V/hile this is priraarily a technical question I cannot help feeling that further local investigation might show that our information on this aspect of the matter is not yet absolutely complete. The fact that Imperial Airways* although they were by way of having investigated the whole matter last winter* have only now, a few weeks before the new route is due to start operation* found that a further landing ground is necessary, suggests that the technical aspect of the question has not yet been adequately examined. Might it not then be well, before His Majesty*s Government commit themselves to a forward policy of coercion at K&amp;lba, for a further reconnaissance to be made over Muscat territory South or North of that place* in order that we may at least be sure that there really is absolutely no practicable alternative to taking so drastic a line as that suggested - or at any rate implied - in your draft telegram?

We are in agreement with your draft, out I n^ve one small suggestion to offer in connection with lines 9 and 10 of para. 2. It is only in the very unlikely event of the Sheikh digging in his toes and offering resistance that ooercitive measures will be required. Normally, I think that if he is told firmly what he has got to do, he will do it. It seems to me, therefore, that if lines 9 and 10 are re-worded as follows: 'measures which might ultimate ly become necessary should he prove obstructive' it would perhaps make this point clearer^, /a/- E.P.

Please see minute on P.Z. 4820/32 and the telegram from the Political Resident oi 5th September, reporting that the attitude of the Sheikh of Kalba when interviewed by the Political Agent, Muscat, was unsatisfactory, and that, unless an alternative site can be selected in Muscat territory, compulsion will be necessary to overcome the Sheikh’s objections. Mr. Crombie and I attended a meeting this morning at the Air Ministry, at which this question was discussed with representatives of Imperial Airways and the Air Ministry. The conclusion of the meeting was that the site at Dibah was definitely unsuitable, and that it would require a great deal of work to prepare a landing ground which would be of service even in emergency. For the reasons given in Colonel Fowle’s telegram, a site further south in Muscat territory also appeared to be out of the question, since it would mean % an unjustifiable diversion of the route, and no suitable spot had been reconnoitred. The meeting concluded that the only alternative would be to apply pressure to the Sheikh, whose refusal to discuss the question of a landing ground was considered to be due, ir. all probability, to fear of trouble from his neighbours, notably the Sheikh of Fujairah, who is a more powerful chief, and might be expected to make trouble if Kalba should acquiesce in the proposal without consulting him. The Air Ministry accordingly asked that a telegram should be despatched to the Political Resident, asking him. unless he saw strong objection on political grounds to the application of compulsion, to take such steps as he thought fit, in co-operation with the local Naval/Naval and Air authorities, as will convince the Sheikh that we mean business. It was also pointed out that the emergency landing ground, which is required chiefly for the Imperial| Airways service, would also be of considerable advantage dump of petrol was an essential to the safety of the air route. necessary to use would naturally be left largely to his discretion, but it was suggested that it would be an advantage if he were himself to proceed in a warship to Kalba and arrange, if possible, for a simultaneous demonstration by Service aircraft in the neighbourhood. We promised to draft a telegram to carry out the intention 0 of the meeting, and to circulate it to the Departments interested for concurrence.

They consider that Sheikh should be pressed to agree unless there are strong political objections to the coercive measures which might then ultimately become necessary (in which case will Resident and Government of India please telegraph again). Details of approach to Sheikh would be left to Residents discretion but it is suggested that he might himself proceed to Kalba in a warship and inform Sheikh that facilities desired, for which small annual payment will be made, must be provided, and that he will be held responsible for security of petrol dump, which will be supplied by A.P.O'.C. from Muscat, and of any aeroplanes which may land at Kalba. During Fowle's visit it might also be arranged that aservice aircraft should land at Kalba and mark out landing ground. 3.

Kalha is on the east side of the Musandim Peninsula. Its status is rather uncertain, 'but according to the Persian Gulf pilot it is under the government of the Sheikh of shargah.

Sir, I ara coramanded by the Air Council to refer to previous correspondence on the subject of the forthcoming operation by Imperial Airways Ltd. of their air service to India via the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf. In this connection I am to state, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, that the Company still consider it desirable that an emergency landing ground should be provided on the stage between Gwadar and Sharjah in order particularly that westbound aircraft may on occasion make an intermediate landing when necessary for the purpose of refuelling. The Company consider that Kalba, on the east coast of the Oman Peninsula, approximately 40 miles south of Dibah, offers the best facilities and it has been ascertained that with a certain amount ol labour a landing area about 900 yards x 550 yards could be provided there. As regards accommodation all that would be required would be suitable storage for petrol. From enquiries which have been made it is thought that the local Sheikh would offer no objection to the use of Kalba by aircraft of Imperial Airways Ltd. subject to payment for the facilities provided. The Council will be glad, therefore, if the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf may be instructed by telegraph to visit Kalba as early as convenient and to 30PY SENT B The Undifer Se report upon t he possibili ty nf-unjtnhln fff-rangements being ^n^e with the '^hb use'of Kalba. ihe jCtA- ?

Copies sent to Government of India and Political Resident Bushire by air mail of 6th August). 12. Kalb a . - This villagpwas visited on the afternoon of 5th April. The district is controlled by an independent Shaikh who was very friendly and personally conducted Commander MacGrath and me over the proposed site. He said ^ he had no objections to visits by land planes but would require compensation. He was told that no visit would be made until he had had an interview with the Political Resident. 13. The area was reported on in my Signal W.l of 5.4.32. A good site already exists immediately South ofthe village. The ground is hard, firm shale, there are no signs of flooding. At present there is a clear piece of ground five hundred yards by five hundred with good approaches. This site could be used now, care only being required to avoid landing short or overshooting into rather rough ground- boundary marks would eliminate this risk. With abouo a fortnight to three weeks’ work the landing area could be extended to 900 - 1,000 yards by 550. A few small mounds and depressions required grading. Labour can be made available and material exists for building the Rest House. 14* A disadvantage to the site is that the prevailing winds blow from the South West and North East, across the landing ground, they are however usually strong and it is thought that 500 yards with no obstacles to clear, should be sufficient for the Hannibal. 15. The coast is exposed and there is no seaplane anchorage; Khor Kalb a, about 3 miles South of the village, was investi- ; gated, but it is too narrow and shallow. The holding ground for/for ships is bed and a heavy surf is frequently experienced on the coast, for this reason a depot ship could not be used. Difficulty would certainly be experienced in landing heavy stores, petrol etc. Water is plentiful and sheep can be obtained. 16. The weather conditions are generally good and the area l|is well clear of the hills. The place is not recommended limainly on account of its isolation and its doubtful security.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0001f5_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/1963</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0001f5</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/1963</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 5/17 ‘Air Route to India (Arab Coast): Landing grounds at Kalba, Shinas, and Dibah’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1932/1947</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-12-20T23:41:35</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (235 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence for this description commences at the inside front cover with 1, and terminates at the last folio with 236; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.

This includes material related to negotiations between Tom Hickinbotham, the Political Agent at Bahrain, and the Shaikh of Kalba (Shaikh Said bin Hamad) in August 1936: a copy of the agreement reached can be found on folios 63-64. In addition, the file contains correspondence discussing the terms that the British Government are prepared to accept for the use of Kalba. It therefore covers the following: the facilities required, the amount of rent to be paid, the provision of a gift of rifles and ammunition, the necessity of offering the Shaikh of Kalba some level of British protection, and the desirability of formally recognising his independence via the grant of a personal three gun salute. A discussion over the appropriateness of using force following the Shaikh's initial refusal in 1932 is recorded in some detail, as is the consideration of alternatives; this includes a proposal for the establishment of an alternative site at Shinas in 1933.The file also briefly covers a request from Trans American Airlines in 1946 to fly over the territory of the Sultan of Muscat, and a request that they may be permitted to use the emergency landing ground at Shinas.The main correspondents are as follows: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Trenchard Craven William Fowle and William Rupert Hay), the Political Agent at Bahrain, and the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat (Ralph Ingham Hallows). The file also contains correspondence between officials of the Admiralty, the Air Ministry, the Foreign Office, the India Office, and personnel stationed at RAF Hinaidi (Iraq).The volume includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the volume by year.
