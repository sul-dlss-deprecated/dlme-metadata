Taweret is a protective deity, particularly connected to pregnancy and birth. Amulets in the shape of Taweret became popular in the Third Intermediate period. \r\n\r\nThis figure is large for an amulet and displays the goddess wearing a long wig and modius (calathos) with uraei (cobra serpents) on her head. While the standard posture of Taweret is with her arms hanging down beside her body, this figure shows her right arm resting on her belly. And the glaze is almost gone. It is very difficult to read what the original color of the glaze was.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1930", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/37415", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Maurice Nahman, Cairo [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1930, by purchase; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "early Ptolemaic Dynasty", "Reign": null, "OnView": 1, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:13:40.063", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_48.1539_3Qtr_DD_T08.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_48.1539_3Qtr_DD_T08.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_48.1539_3Qtr_DD_T08.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_48.1539_3Qtr_DD_T08.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_48.1539_3Qtr_DD_T08.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "3193", "Images": "PS1_48.1539_3Qtr_DD_T08.jpg, PS1_48.1539_Back_DD_T08.jpg, PS1_48.1539_Fnt_DD_T08.jpg, PS1_48.1539_LftSide_DD_T08.jpg, PS1_48.1539_RtSide_DD_T08.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Centre Street: Second Floor: Egyptian Art"}
