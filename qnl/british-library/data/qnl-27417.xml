(Received 26th, 10.30 a-m.) Clear the line. (? 8976.) t ribes in Hillah Division are getting out of control of their own Chief, and position at Kerbela is delicate. I have sent Fakhri Kanmna (who is known to Sir P. Cox of old) to Kerbela in the hope that he may be able to restrain rowdy element in the town and explain to the Ulema the urgency in their own interests of doing all in their power. Saiyid lalib Pasha arrived this morning from Basrah. I discussed situation at length withliim. He was very emphatic as to tlie impossibility of starting an Arab Government in Mesopotamia at an early date on the lines desired by llis Majesty’s Government, and apparently despaired of any practical assistance in this matter from Baghdad notables, of whom he said that one half had brains and no stomach and the other half were conversely endowed. He made much of the fact that they had been, unable to agree as to who should go to London on their behalf or to what they should say when they got there, nor as to who would meet tiie expenditure involved. He was willing, nevertheless, to take the risk involved to his life by taking a leading part in local politics on the lines desired by us, provided that we guarantee him personal protection and support for himself and for his sons somewhat on the same lines as the guarantee we have given to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, accom panied, I gathered, with some promise of financial support, as he is a man with practically no private means, f promised to refer this to His Majesty’s Government. I should be glad of instructions as to what reply 1 should give him. He blamed me for not taking drastic action during or before Ramadhan against Baghdad subjects, vide your telegram of 18th June, last sentence, but seemed to agree that it was too late to take action now, unless we had force, to suppress any demon stration that might result, which is not the case at the moment. He urged very strongly that now that we have a policy we should bring back the best Baghdadi element from Syria, particularly J afar Pasha. In this connection please see your telegram dated 8th July last in reply to my telegram of 3rd July, No. 8039. 1 do not know whaf is in the mind of His Majesty’s Government, but f venture to urge once more that 1 be given the desired permission. Had I been able to take this step before anti not after serious trouble arose on the Euphrates and in Syria we should be in a stronger position than we shall be now towards these persons.

In August, September and October of 1914 the ^ Resident Bushire was in touch with S&amp;yid Talib through the Shaikh of Mohoxaerah, and in conjunction with the arrangements made with the latter for his participation in military operations against the Turks it was proposed to enlist if possible the cooperation of Sayid Talib. On the 14th of September the Resident Bushire telegraphed to the Government of India for of their sanctior/the draft of a proposed letter to Sayid Talib offering him in return for his cooperation with the Shaikhs of Koweit and kohomerah the following terms: - (1) Exemption from revenue on his date gardens between Fao and Gurnah. (2) Guarantee against reprisals by Turks. (3) Safeguarding of hereditary rights and privileges of his family in Basrah. 4. On Octoner 28th the Resident was informed that : pending the actual outbreak of war the proposed terms could not be communicated to Sayid Talib in writing but that he might be told informally that 'upon the degree of his influence and the extent to which he ! uses it in our interests will depend his eventual position &lt;x) (t5fc8l)U) Wt.

Up to this date (October 28th) the Shaikh of M oh on or ah % had been in constant communication with Sayid Talib^, more or less on our behalf, as may be inferred from the following telegraphic report of the Consul Mohomerah dated the 29th October. 'To-day the Shaikh communicated some proposals from Sayid Talib, but admitted they were preposterous. He is going to see the Sayid again on the subject. It apoears, however, that a guarantee, that Sayid Talib should be recognised as Governor of Pasrah under our protection, rather on lines of Koweit, is, at present, a sine qua non'. That previous negotiations on these lines had taken place may be inferred from the telegram of the Government of India Ko.8992 of October 28th in which it is stated 'Sayiti Talib cannot be recognised as Shaikh or Amir of Basrah under our protection'. ^.e ie no direct record of the course if any which negotiation with Sayid Talib pursued after the outbreak of war to the date of his arrival at Koweit (November 1^ 7 ’ xt wou l d appear however, from Viceroy»s telegram to Secretary of State dated 30th November, that Cox had made Sayid Talib a friendly offer which the latter had refused. This may refer to the teams previously mentioned in para.2. B. On or about November 15th Sayid Talib decamped from Koweit to the tents of Bin Sauri. 9- On the 26th Sir P.Oox contemplated allowinp Sayid Talit to return to Eaerah and cmplia^tia as a sort of personal Political attache', and ultiraately, if he should prove satisfactory, o E A rah attache to the/GdvornmentMinute Paper Department at Basrah.

On the 13th January Sir P.Cox reported that Sayid Talib realised Basrah was no place for himself and was anxious to find a haven elsewhere under British protection. It was decided to send him to Bombay temporarily os a State guest. 11. Please see P.7513 and P.7656^. Cairo on the 16th of October/suggested the return of Sayid Talib to Basrah.

I have discussed vzith Lieut.Colonel Gordon Talker, Political Officer at Basrah, possibility of permitting return of Seiyid Talib before peace is signed. The Political Officer considers we can now allow him to return provided he undertakes to play no part in local politics and to live, at all events for the present in retirement. Whatever his sentiments may be, we cannot at present, in view of local dissensions, hold out any hope of giving him a seat on the local divisional Council, on which his family is already well represented. His children and servants may accompany him. It is, however, desired that his return should, if possible, be deferred until the New Year in order that the Political Officer may have time to explaim the matter informally and privately to the leading member of the Basrah divisional Counci).

Sir With reference to the correspondence ending with Mr. Bray's endorsement No. 1060-W. dated the 12th November 1917, I am directed to enclose herewith a copy of a note of an interview between Shaikh Salim al Khayum and Sir Percy Z. Cox at Bombay on the 31st July 1918, and to state that the Government of Bombay have sanction' ed the payment of an allowance of Rs. 600/- UST PlSAS-gl- to the Shaikh with effect from 1st July 1918. I have, etc., Sd/- J.E.C. Jukes, Deputy Secretary to Government.Interview between Shaikh Salim al Khayum and Sir P.Z. Cox, Bombay, July 31st 1918. Being informed when halting in Bombay on route back to Mesopotamia that Shaikh Salim was anxious to interview me regarding his affairs, I met him by arrangement at the Office of the Commissioner of Police on above date. The Commissioner of Police and Mr. Griffiths, Deputy Commissioner, were present at the interview. Previous to Shaikh Salim's arrival they had informed me that the position was that though he was not to the best of their knowledge and belief conducting himself in any way viciously, he was living in a style and in circles in which it was not really possible to live in his present allowance of Rs. 250/- per month. Incidentally they mentioned that Shaikh Salim's ordinary means of conveyance was a motor car and he was keenly interested in racing. He did not, so far as was known, keep any racing ponies but he did a certain amount of horse coping. As there seemed some doubt about Shaikh Salim's status in Iraq, I explained that he was simply Shaikh of the small riverside settlement of Chibaish on the Euphrates between Kuma and the Hammar Lake. The Shaikh who succeeded him, and his neighbours of similar stand ing, receiving from Government personal subsidies of percentage on revenue collected, varying from Rs. 150/- to Rs. 300/- per mensem. EUring the time of the Turks Shaikh Salim held the post of Yuzbashi, or Lieutenant of Gendarmerie and received 80 Idfras per month for the upkeep of a certain number of water police on his section of the river; the 80 Liras representing their pay. No doubtdoubt Salim, in controlling tbls district and collect ing revenue tm tor Government, made some pickings but so far as is fcxmEK known he does not personally own any private property. In fact, during his absence in India, I have been gi-ving his fam£ly a subsistence allowance as they had no other source of income. If he, Shaikh Salim, does really own landed property in this district he should fce able to produce land registration documents, but this he has hitherto failed to do and apart from such documents it is not possible to verify his claim until a complete record of rights :i can be worked out. This probably will not be possible during the war. It must be assumed, therefore that there is no private income of which Salim, or anybody else on his behalf, can or does get the enjoyment and that for the present purposes, at any rate, he and his family are dependent on what Government are pleased to give them. | He was deported for continuing to intrigue with the Turks long after his fellow Shaikhs of the neighbour hood had made their submission to Government and immediately after his deportation his successor was murdered under circumstances which leave hardly any doubt that Salim instigated the crime. There is not the least reason, therefore, why he should receive over generous treatment. He is fortunate in not being interned and the most that he can reasonably expect is that we should give him enough to live quietly as an Arab gentleman. It was agreed in principle between myself and the Commissioner of Police before Salim entered the room that his allowance should be increased to Rs. 500/- to 600/- per mensem and that if Salim did not feel able to live within this amount he had betterbetter be interned. Salim then came in and after exchange of greetings had a friendly discussion with myselfaa and the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner of Police. I found him looking very well physically. I told him that Mr. Vincent had informed me that he wished to represent that the allowance which he now received did not suffice for his expenses and I asked him to detail to me briefly the main heads of his necessary expenditure e.g. house rent, gharry and motor hire, servants and food. The figure which he totalled to a few Eupees under Bs. 300/- per mensem and that left nothing for entertainment and miscellaneous expenses. I reminded him of the^expont&gt;ee for which he hadjbeen sent out of Mesopotamia and explained to him that he could not reasonably expect Government under the circumstances to give him such allowance as would enable him to keep a mo.tor car and go in for racing and that he must cut his coat according to his cloth. I said I was glad to find from the Commissioner of Police that they had no complaints to make as to his manner of life apart from the fact that he was spending more than his allowance and that I was in agreement with than that he needed more and was prepared to arrange for an increase to Hs. 500/ , st any rate and to Rs. 600 /-/| S limit, but if he could not live within that amount the only course would be to transfer him to Bellary or to some place where he would be open to less temptation to spend money. On the other hand he seemed contended here and if he could make up his mind to live quietly wilthin that amount there would be no need to disturb present arrangements so long es he conducted himself to the satisfaction of 'them -j Commissioner of Police. He replied that he was in our hands in this matter though he would like the allowance mademade up to Rs.ipOO/- if possible and that if the authorities did not see their way to go beyond Rs. 600/- h«&gt; begged that they would lend him Rs. 400/- per mensem to be recovered frtm him in the future. I explained that this was not practicable politics as there was no source, so fa» as I know, from which to recover it. On the other hand, if his relations really had any money or were getting any income, he could arrange with them to send him Rs. 400/- per month and I had no objection. It was settled finally that he should receive Rs. 600/- pdr mensem from the 1st July inclusive. He then prayed to be allowed to return to Mesopousnta for two months. This proposal I expressed my inability to undertake under any circumstances and told him he must resign himself to remain contentedly in India until the end of the war and I added that his young son Paleh had been put in as nominal Shaikh of Chicaish under our supervision, and provided that he, Salim tehaved to our satisfaction till the end of the war we hoped that it would be possible for him ultimately to return to Chlbalsh, but that depended entirely on hi&gt;s satisfactory behaviour. I told him that If he wisned to send any letters back to his relations by me I should be happy to take them and we then parted. July^ist 1918. Sd/- P.Z. Cox.

AUZ ov^~ i ^To^ixAr-' The internal political condition of Turkish Iraq in the spring and summer of 1913 and 1914 was more disturbed than it had been for Some years. Though there could not be said to have been anything approaching to an organized Arab movement in 'this province a certain number of Arab 'nationalists' existed and were actively working in co-operation with Syrian Nationalist ♦ i Societies against the existing Turkish system o# government . Basrah took the lead in this movement under the guidance of Saiyid Talib a member of the most venerated Sunni family on the Shatt-al-Arab that of the Naqib. After a brief flirtation with the Committee of Union and Progress he discovered that its Ottomanizing policy left no scope for his ambition^which was nothing less than the establishing of a s^mi-autonomous province with himself as its ruler. His aims brought him into conflict not only with the Commitoee but with the powerful Sac’dun family who controlled the Lfuntafik Arabs. The Ottoman Government,jealous of the influence of Sa’ dun Pasha,the paramount chief, used Saiyid Talib to delivar im into their hands, an action which earned for Saiyid Talib the undying hate of 3 a’dun’s son’Ajaimi, and threw the latter into the arms of the Committee as an opponent of the Liberal Party, Saiyid lalib’s organization. In the apring of 1913 the Wali of Basrah attempted to counter Saiyid Talib’s growing influence with the help of Munja^fik forces under ’Ajaimi* but Saiyid Talib was too quick for him. He put Basrah into a state of defence against the Mun^^fik threat, caused the Turkish Commandant, a staunch adherent of the Committee^ to be assassinated in the public street, cowed the authorities and forced them to issue a programme of reform, ^hile complying outwardly with Saiyid Talib’s demands the CommitteeComitteft were resolved on Tils overthrow. He got wind of their intentions and immediately before the war enured into negotiations with us through the Shaikh of ?'uha/anerah but the pretensions he put forward were immoderate. Feelin;- his position at Basrah to be dangerously unstable lie took r-fuge in Central Arab‘S and afi*r the outbreak of war came in to us at Kuwait and consented to retire into voluntary exile . in India.Let: 2 v Dated Receiv i.'o. 7 89 H SEP 1817 j (59) 1Q17 2 Telegram f*;; No. 180-S., dated the 6th February 1917.

Sir Arthur Hirtzel, In the papers you had sent to me and also in others which came to me officially in Kuwait I have noticed that Sayid Talib of Basra seems to be regarded as a 'deus ex machina'' or solver of all local ills in Arabia and Mesopotamia. I cannot understand how he has acquired this position, or rather how he has managed to maintain it in 'th© report© of our own officers. The man is a strong, wilful, utterly unscrupulous character usually heavily in debt and consequently importunate. He has a dozen or more murders to his credit and holds Basra in the hollow of his hand by means of a band of armed men who occupy his house there like a fort, issuing thence to execute their master's behests in the matter of replenishing his exchequer when required. No H/ali at Basra is ever able to carry on his administrative work unless he first agrees to be the willing tool of Sayid Talib. Bin Baud, Sheikh Mubarak, and Sheikh Khazal all subsidise him with a regular ^nthl^^r^ua! salary solely to protect themselves from continual/demands accompanied by threats. Not one of these Chiefs however would trust Sayid Talib with any negotiation on their own behalf. Sayid Talib generally induces the Central troveinment to depute him as their envoy for the solution of their difficulties in Mesopotamia, the local Wall generally being his strongest supporter for the simple reason that unless Sayid Talib is allowed some of the pickings always available on these occasions, matters usually come to a deadlock through his instrumentality. 26.6.1914.

To Bis Bicellency ^ord Chelmsford, Viceroy of India. lour excellency, I nave the honour to Bring to lour excellency 1 s note the following facts regarding myself. I Belonged to the party of Bui tan Abdul ilamid v/hom the Young Turks deposed. I had never oeen iriends with ^ue Youn^, Turks. A little before the war broke out they wanted to make peace with me. Then I gave my word of honour that I would ao nothing against them. At the same time they were uound no u to do anything against me. khen the war did break out I oould not actively help the English. Bhen Bassra was taken by the English/Turkey seems to have thought it was due to my help. The English thought because I did noc render any help to them that my leanings were towards Turkey, under these circumstances I thought it was not safe for me to remain m Bassra and requested that I may be sent to any place under the British. The English Government also thought that it would be b ood to me and good to the Government also that 1 shoulu leave Bassra. I took the suggestion and at once left Bassra for Bombay, ^er since I c^ie to India I have had nothing’ but kindness at the hands of the good Government of India, and I am highly grateful to it. How things have happened in Arabia which release me from the word I had given to Turkey. An Aptian newspaper - A1 Makatham - published in Cairo gives in its issue datea 12th July 1916 (page 5, paragraph 3) copies of which may he had in Delhi, the names of a number of Arabian noblemen who have been, under the Partial Law, ordered to he executes, imprisoned or deported by the Young Turks. I find my name in it. They have issued a Summons asking me to he presentia tlie Court within 10 days from the date of ouimnons to explain why I should not he punished for helping - the English, iou know I did not help the English; nor did I do anything against the Young lurks. If I did not present myself within the 10 days they have issued orders to hang me when they cutcn me. i».ey n^ne uung many noblemen in i&gt;yria. Till now they have hung 250, imprisoned bout SuO for a period iron 5 to 15 yeart, and uapoioeu thousands. It must be more than 2 months since the order against ua has been issued. The news is given in kliakatham dated 12th July. It is difficult to obtain news from nyria; it must have taken a long time for this news to reach agypt from iJyria. I am glad that Turkey has taken the initiative in freeing me from the word of honour given to her. As she has broken faion with me I am free now to help the English Government. With a clean conscience I could help the British in kecca, Jiddah and other places in Arabia. The Bheriff of kecca is right in having revolted against the tyranny of Turkey. I know the Sheriff well; he is a good friend of mine; he would not have done anything against Turkey unless there were very good reasons. The ioung Turks who may be termed a set of anarchists would have harmed the Sheriff if he had not tried to protect himself with an army and rise against them.

The family of the Nakibs of Basrah claim to be descendants of the great Muhammadan saint, Sayyid Ahmad er Rifai, whose tomb stands in the centre of the Jazira, half way between the Albu Darraj territory and the Hai* He was a purely Sunni saint and is held in no honour by the Shiahs# Large tjacts of land from time to time assigned to the Nakibs for the upkeep of the tomb of Sayyid Ahmad er Rifai and also for that of the less will -known saint, Sayyid Shaban, whose tomb lies between Bastfah and Zobair# These lands werejfproperly Mulhaqa Waqf, the Nakib of the time being Mutawalli- and the naqibs were bound by religious laws to spend the proceeds of the lands entrusted to them on the upkeep of the shrines# The latest Nakibs have been:- Saiyid Talib (from Mendeli) \ succeeded his brother in law Abdul 1 Rahman• 7 \ r '•v Saiyyid Abdur Rahman. Sister# Sayyid Muhammad Said. (died 1874 childless) (died 1896 having resigned in 1890) Sayyid Rejeb. Sayyid*Ahmed, (present Nakib appointed in 1890) (died^ 1904) 1 y— Sayyid Ha shim, -y Sayyid Talib. Sayyid Yusuf# Hamad. It appears that about the year 1890 the present i^akib, *^ayyid Rejjeb, under the influence of his brother, Sayyid Ahmad, who had made much money by gun-running, managed by bribery and other means to get the various lands held by him as Liulhaqa *.aqf re- ist.roc by the Tapu Dept# as the private property of himself and his brother# This was to the advantage of Sayyid Ahmad, as otherwise the Laqf property would have descended to the elder branch as mutwaj-li^s. There happened to be in Basrah an exceptionally honest ali, uamdi Pasha# He got wind of this transaction and began moving to prevent the fraud. Thereupon Sayyid Rejjeb used his influence at Constantino** pie^ Hamdi Pasha dismissed* ai Pasha was again appointed ali at Basrah and ^hto conflict with the Nakib, Sayyid Rejjeb. The Nakib, moil with Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait, who also disliked Hamdi firm . 4 ± , . . . . Pasha and who was a/friend of the Nakib's family owing to their joint participation in gun-running, sent Sayyid Talib, his son, to Consiantiiofiie to Represent that all troubles with the Shaikh of Kuwait was due to Hamdi Pasha. This was the first occasion of Sayyid Talib’s entry into Constantinople politics. He succeeded in getting Hamdi Pasha dismissed and in procuring the appointment as Wall of Muhsin Pasha, Military Commandant who was friendly both to Shaikh Mubarak and to the Nakib* Owing to this success and the support of the new V.ali, Muhsin Pasha, and of Shaikh Mubarak, Sayyid Talib now became a powerful personality in Basrah. His next step in the year 1900 was to^secure the support of Shaikh Khazal of Muhanmerah by the murder of Effendi, Rav;anduzi(Kurd), the particular enemy of Shaikh Khazal. Ths valuable Basra date gardens of the Muhammerah family stood in the name,, of Muzel, elder brother of Shaikh Khazal. Muzel was a Turkish^sub and so was allowed to hold land. When Muzal was assassinated m yi ; Muhammerah, Shaikh Khazal took steps to ha* the date gardens . ^ transferred bo his own name. Rawanduzi, telegraphed to Const^opla , pointing out that Khazal was a Persian subject and could not under the law hold land in Turkey. He claimed 10 % of the value of ^ , j land as informer. Thereupon Mirza Hamza, the Shaikh's agen^coryrre with Sayyid Talib, who had the Rawanduzi shot in bbejtr^ y •****■' by two of his men. Frightened by this demonstration, the SurHsh . authorities gave way and allowed the properties to be reared ; Shaikh Khazal's name. Sayyid Talib was thus instrumental in **t«*S^ Shaikh Khazal acknowledged as owner of the Basra prepare*— ^ this time onwards Sayyid Talin yearly received largo ^ *** ?• 1 Shaikhs of Muhammerah and Kuwait to induce him to lo^ &amp;fid* th9ir1 L*. interests in Busrah. About 1902 Sayyid Talib, using the powerful support of the Wali and of Shaikh Mubarak and Khazal, was appointed Mutasarrif of sa, but his regime there was so cruel that he had to be speedily removed and returned to Basrah. Sayyid Talib, with his uncle Sayyid Ahmad, now set up in Basrah as a regular bully : levying blackmail on all the rich men and plundering any one who refused to serve him, by means of professional robbers whom he kept in his house. Among others he openly robbed Abdur Razzak, son of Haji Taha. His career vvas checked in 1904 by the dismissal of his friend, the Wali Muhsin Pasha, and the appoint ment of a strong man, Mukhlis Pasha, Mukhlis kasha surrounded the house of Sayyid Talib and Sayyid Ahmad and arrested their whole band of hired blackguards. Sayyid Ahmad died of chagrin at the end of 1904; and the next Wali, Fikri Pashajf in the beginning of 1905 got Sayyid Talib removed to Constantinople where he was made a menhir of the §araj Dowla. d ere he made friends with Sayyid Abdul Hidr and Prince Izzeddin who was lately assassinated. When the Committe of Union and Progress was first formed in 1909,Sayyid Talib returned to Basrah and tried to be recognised as leader of the new party in Basrah. But they feared him and, in order to get rid of him from Basrah, sent him as a Deputy to ConstantinopUj There he made friends with Sadik Beg, and together with evolved the J idea of the -Hurr-i-Mutadil' or moderate liberal movement, which ,| practically became the name of the policy of the ycun* Arab party. He returned constantly to Basrah oppose the Unim-jm* P^gresa— Partv there, and earned the approval and frienship of the late J Grand Vizier, Kiamil Pasha by so doing. His chief partisans in Basra j were Arif Bey Mardinli,(now in Constantinople), Ahmad es Sanaa . ..« Qhnikh Ibrahim of Zubair. His Pasha, Abdul Latif Mandil, anc. ohaiKn loran principal opponent .at W«» advocated anbeervienc. to the Co-ittee oi »nion and Pnegno... E 5 M Talin destroyed earl, in UU * decoying M* «•*. l *4 1 1... Q^) power Ox e after the Muntafiks had rebelled against him# Sayyid Talib thus earned the lasting enemy of Ajemi, son of Sadun. When Kiamil Pasha became Grand Vazier in 1912 he advised Sayyid Talib to make advances to the British* In pursuance of this policy Sayyid Talib visited Egypt at the beginning of 1912, made friends with the Khedive and met Lord Kitchner, and on returning from Egypt went up to Simla with letters of introduction from Mr* Crow,British Consul at Basrah, and saw Lord Hardinge* On his return from Simla in 1912, ^ayyid Talib, secure in the support of the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Muhammerah, and, as he probably thought, of the British, seems for the first time to have definitely conceited the idea of governing the Basra Yilayat him self and becoming Shaikh or Amir of all the Arabs of Basrah. He seems to have abondoned at this stage his former ideal of democratic government by local Arab assemblies, and to have substituted the ideal of a great confederation of Arab Shaikhs and Amirs, each of them autocratic in his own dominions, but banded together to carry out general Arab aims under perhaps the nominal suzerainty of .die Sultan. The conflederaoy would apparently have consisted of the Sharif of Mecca, the Imam Yahya in Yemen, Sayyid Idris, I bn Rasnid, Ibn Baud, the Shaikhs of Muhammerah and Kuwait, and Sayyid Talib as Shaikh or Amir of the Basra Yilayat* How the great x-ribes of Baghdad were to be represented is not clear; but the Kurdish chiefs were to be allowed to join the movement* The first step necessary for Sayyid Talib was evidently to make himself paramount in the Basrah Vilayat. This he attempted In secure by cultivating friendly relations with the Araara Shaikhs through the Shaikh of Muhammerah, and by influencing the grant of leases to those Shaikhs at the Basra Headquarters. Simultaneously he tried to get hold of the Muntafiks by winning over Abdullah el Faleh, the rival of Sadun Pasha and of Ajemi and one of the claimants to the headship of the Muntafik tribes. This ^ayyid _C M ' © Talib did through Ahmad es Sanaa Pasha* e finally induced the * Y/ali to support Abdullah el ^aleh against the recalcitrant tenant of Muamer, Haji Neghaimish, and to put the Faleh family in 1913 into possession of this very valuable estate which had long been use less to them# Having now temporarily secured all the Arabs of the ^asrah Vilayet, Sayyid Talib proceeded in April 1913 to get up a public protest against the new Vilayat Law and threatened to use force against the Wali# His proceedings were suddenly interrupted by the arrival of Ajemi with a considerable force outside Basrah, who appeared openly as the supporter of the Y/ali and of the Committee of Union and Progress against Sayyid ^alib. Simultaneously the Wali of Basrah (Ala-ud-Din Bey) and the Military Commandant (Firid Bey) seemed to have received secret instructions from Constantinople to help Ajaimi and to murder or capture Sayyid Talib. Fights began In Basrah between the adherents of Abdullah el Faleh and Ajaimi; more and more of Ajaimi f s men drifted into Basrah,with the connivance of the Wali and Commandant; and Sayyid Talib’s position seemed exceedingly precarious when on the 19th June Ul- his adherents assassinated the Commandant as he was landing from a ooat in the Ashar Greek, and mortally wounded the Mutsarrif of the Muntafik who was with him. This frightened the Turkish Government. The Wali was dismissed, an acting Wali Izzat Bey as appointed and in August 1913 a programme of reforms was published which made many concessions to the Arabs. This does not seem o have sa^isfiv.d iho Arab Committee, who at ttee^eirtl^of SupsXdistributed among the troops and Arab tribes a long address aalling all men of Arab race to rise and throw off Turkish tyranny by asserting the independence of Iraq. Enver Bey, who was now in power, ordered the Military Commandant to arrest Sayyid Talib, but the Commandant reported that he was powerless# In December 1913 Sayyid Talin sent a second threatening address to Constantinople# Enver Bey then telegraphed to him w Ling advar 5 «?s and saying th?* he had ordered the Walls ofof Basrah and Baghdad to consult him about everything. The Sultan conferred a high order upon him and Sayyid Talib issued in January 191t a manifesto saying thatfall differences were removed between -him and the Turkish Government and that he would in future do all that lay in him to promote Ottomem unity. Finally in May 1914 Sayyid Talib seemed to have reached the zenith of his power. The Minister of the Interior telegraphed offering him the choice between the posts of Ambassador, Wali, or member of the Senate and in July Talaat Bey informed the Britiih Ambassador that Sayyid Talib was to be made Wali of Basrah. In the meanwhile Djaved Pasha, Wali of Baghdad, seems to have had secret instructions to arrest Sayyid Talib. He tried to induce Subhi Beg to do so, and failing, started down in October 1914 towards Basrah himself for the purpose with a considerable force, arriving just after the outbreak of war with Great Britain. Sayyid Talib had news of his intentions and withdrew to Kuwait, ostensibly with the purpose of negotiating to bring Ibn Baud in against the British. Sayyid Talib was still in Kuwait when the British occupation of ^asra^ took place. He mad.© extravagant demands as ^o the price of his assistance and, when these were refused,voluntarily withdrew to India. It is said that the Shaikhs of Muhammerah and Kuwait no longer desire his return, since their estates in Basrah territory are now safe and he could be of no use to t-hem. Basrah, July 19th, 1916.

From—The Hon’ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.S.I., K.C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Hon’ble Mr. A. H. Grant, C.S.I., C.I.E., Foreign Secretary to the Govern ment of India, Foreign and Political Department, Delhi. I have the honour to refer to Foreign Department letter No. 2354-\\dated 9th December 1915, forwarding for an expression of my opinion a translation of a petition^ from Saiyid Talib Bey to His Excellency the Viceroy. 2. I attach a copy of the letter which I wrote to Saiyid Talib on the e've of his departure for India. It will be remembered that he was translatad from Bombay to the Madras Presidency on the motion of the Commissioner of Police, Bombay, (vide Foreign Department Endorsement 322, dated the 17th Febmai) 1915). From my point of view there is no objection to his living in Bangalore or Lahore, if it is not inconvenient to the Government of India and if he can so order his life as to give the Police authorities no reason to object to his presence ; bu I imagine that he would be a great nuisance to the Government of India if he were to live in Delhi. But I am of the very decided opinion that Saiyid Talib cannot be allowed to return to Iraq for a considerable time to come, and that at present it is no possible to name or contemplate any particular juncture or date when his return could be safely permitted. It seems therefore hardly possible to give him complete liberty, but the climate of northern India is undoubtedly more akin to that of Basra than is that of the Madras Presidency, and if the Government of India can see their way to give him a change of residence to Lahore or Pindi or some other town m the Punjab, I think that course would meet the case, and would therefore recom mend it for favourable consideration.7 Dated Bellary, the 24th November 1915. From— Saiyed Talib, Nakibzada, Basra, To—His Excellency the Governor-General and Viceroy of India. ‘ After tendering the necessary respects and (offering) prayers for the prolonga tion of Your Excellency’s greatness and the preservation of the dignity of our mighty British Government, may it not be hidden from Your Excellency that I am neither a German nor a Turk, but rather an Arab, the son of an Arab, whose pedigree goes back to the highest of Arab genealogies. For nearly six years I was engaged with the Turks in political strife, the cause of which was the deposition of the or-Sultan and their desire for taking vengeance on his men, of whom I am one, and, if they could encompass my death, they would not delay in doing so. During that period I visited Lord Kitchener when he was in Egypt; he gave me a letter to Sir MacMahon when he was Foreign Secretary at Simla in Ird a. This document was merely a letter of introduction. He (Lord Kitchener) directed me to give him (Sir MacMahon) whatever information was essential. When I met the said gentleman I gave him the letter and he was pleased. I put off communicating the information, however, until another day, but, unfortunately, the intensity of the cold, the suddenness of the change, and the damp I experienced there bfought on high fever which resulted in pneumonia. I was, therefore, obliged to leave Simla without (again) seeing Sir MacMahon. I referred to the Consul in Basra, Mr. Curvin, and to the ambassador at Constanti nople and sought to connect Basra with our present Government in order to avoid the tyranny of the Turks and to help it (the Government) in everything essential. But the answer from all of them was “ Our existing relations with the Turks are excellent and the present time is not favourable to any change in them.” Now, when we despaired of appealing to this great ai d mighty Government (Great Britain) we were obliged to arrange our affairs with the Turks. The lurks, percenmg the difficulty of the situation endeavoured to treat us well. This was a few months before the declaration of war. So 1 was obliged to personally assist them in the so- lution of many political problems around Basra and Baghdad, suclias tlieco- operation of the Amir of kajd, Abdul Aziz as-Saud and other Arab chiefs. They wished to compensate me for my past services and mahe me Governor of Baghdad, or Syria, or Ambassador at Teheran, or a Commissioner in Egypt. But, fearing their treachery, I rejected all these. # Ten days before the declaration of war with the Turks their Secretary for ttar Enver Pasha, proposed to me that I should become War Minister (lit W ar thief) and proclaim to the Islamic world in general that this is a religious war (lit. a religious Tehsdl and therefore it was incumbent upon every Muslim to draw the sword and seek martyrdom viz., death. Meanwhile they set Javid Pasha, the Governor of Baghdad who had subsequently committed the shameful act of running away and bolting back to that city after the affairs of Al-Kurna of which you are aware and I perceiv ed that according to their usual practice, their recent dealings were treacherous and that the situation involved two dangers. Firstly, if I fell in with the views of the Turk it would be tantamount to proclaiming hostility against you. Secondly, Sfdid not agree with ^m they would have accounted me as a f ^and^e me prude'nUoleavt Basra and its’envfns and make it appear to them that I was going to NeTd to wTn over (Ut. to draw) ’ Abdul Aziz as-Saud and so I went forth from StXthe^yW^^ mg arguments. Now, my departure ] diglike of ' the TurkS) i n spite rXzr and had actually given him ten and establish my My personal object was to preser a ll this and I received his rights with you. 1 C° Xrn to Koweit remain there for a short time, reply to tbe effect that I should retu ’ r. *. 0 Basra. I replied and that I should there receive instructions reffiir ■ d t Bombay and live that, better than staying in Koweit would be for me to pioceeu y8 there in gratitude under the shadow of the British flag as there existed between me and the Governor of Kow'eit a kind of personal ill-feeling and, for that reason, 1 did not like him to act as intermediary in anything Therefore I willingly committed mvself to this Government which is sincere and kind in its treatment of its people, as if tl-ev were its children. My father also shared my opinion and directed me to go without hesitation. I also informed Sir Percy Cox t hat whenever lie considered mv presence necessary in Basra, and things had settled down and perfect security prevailed there, he believed in my veracity and sent for me, I should deem it an honour to come and that probably, by means of certain political plans which the exigencies of that time demanded, I might be able to render our mighty Government some important services in preventing the shedding of the blood of innocent per sons He (Sir Percy Cox) replied that my departure for Bombay was more bene- ficiai both in my own interests and in those of the Government and that I should wait there for an answer. I immediately assented and proceeded to my destin- o f inn Forty days after my arrival your august commands issued for me to proceed to Bellary where I arrived in obedience to orders. My house was near the treacher ous Germans who have been the cause of this w r ar, set the world on fire with their mischief and villainy, and deluded the Turks until they made them partners in their iniquity. Now the reason of my troubling your noble ears with these feeble lines is not to request permission to return to Basra, but to ask for the restoration to me of the liberty of which I have been deprived and for the loss of which I see no reason. I hope you will believe what follows and be assured as to my nobility and the no bility of my ancestors, that I am your sincere well-wisher in all matters, and ready to labour in vour interests, even at the cost of my life. In like manner I hope you will regard me with the eye of kindness and compassion and have pity upon me and my sick children for we are continually taking medicine; for the last four months we have been suffering from divers diseases and in addition to all this, 1 am afhicted with rheumatism. If you know that our stay in this place will be prolonged, please order our residence to be changed to a large town where the climate is good and the mind may obtain some consolation in exile. But the best arrangement would be for us to be under your protection at Delhi, Lahore, Bangalore, or Bombay, or wherever you think proper. In case you should wish to speak to me face to- face in order that I may give you some instructive explanations with reference to Iraq in regard to Baghdad, Mosul, and Diar-i-Bakr, I am at your service and awaiting your commands to me and to W. J. Prendergast, Esquire, B. Litt (Oxon) so that he may act as interpreter between me and you, for he is the first man in India with a thorough knowledge of the Arabic language. In any case, my Lord, it is for you to command. Purport of a letter dated January 12th, 1915, from Sir P. Z. Cox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to Saiyid Talih. I duly received your letter dated January 1st through Sulaiman Faizi, and now to-day he has told me that you have actually arrived at Jahara. There is no vessel ready at my disposal at the moment in which I could pro ceed to Koweit to have a talk with you, and it is thus impossible for me to meet you now personally. But you know Colonel Grey and will be able to speak your mind to him as you would to me. I I am convinced that it would be altogether contrary to your own interests as well as to those of the British Government if you were to come over to the Shatt- al-Arab now and therefore what I want you to do is to proceed to Bombay direct by the next mail steamer and to* remain there for the present until you receive further news from me or from the Government of India. I enclose herewith a passport which will save you any inconvenience on arrival.V y In the meantime I will communicate with Government and make o • such recommendations in your favour as seem to be necessary for safeguardi g interests of Government and your further welfare. Ttefore closing I take the opportunity of asking you not to entertain the idea that our friend Shaikh Mubarak has spoken of you unfavourably to me m any wav I assure you it is by no means the case. He has always spoken to me as vour good friend; but I quite understood in present circumstances your wish to deal with officers of Government direct and not through intermediaries. Wishing you a pie sant journey to Bombay. Passport. to remain there for the present. ( 22 ) No. 110-W. (Confidential), dated Delhi, the 26th January 1916. Ftom-J. L.

Butter worth, C.S.I., Chief Secretary to the Governr ment of Madras, To—The Political Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. I am directed to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with my telegram, dated the 6th May 1915, regarding the detention ,at Bellary ol baiym Jlalib Bey, lately of Basrah.3 2. The original orders of the Government of India were to the effect that Saiyid Talib Bey was to be treated as a State guest, but that unobtrusive surveillance would be necessary. It was subsequently explained in your letter No. 531 W., dated the 19th March 1915, that his position as a State guest is limited to the receipt by him from the State of a subsistence allow ance. 3. I am to point out that, in the absence of more definite instructions as to his treatment, some doubt is felt as to the amount and character of the control to be exercised over him. Recently he attempted to communicate in a clandestine manner with two of his friends in India, but the letters were intercepted, and although they contained nothing material, this Government decided to censor all correspondence received by him and issued orders to that effect. Thereafter he complained that he was not in good health and asked for a change, preferably to Bangalore, but this Government said that it was not possible to allow him to go there and asked the District Magistrate, Bellary, to make fresh proposals for a change of dwelling. Talib Bey now wishes to go for motor excursions about the Bellary district and to stay a few days at Ramandrug. He also proposes to invite a man called Abdul Ha q Haqqi Baghdadi, Professor of Arabic at the Aligarh College, and, presumably, a Turkish subject, to stay with him for a month or more. Talib Bey had an interview with this man at Bellary in April last, and there is some ground for suspecting intrigue. This Government are instructing the District Magistrate, Bell ary, not to give any facilities to Saiyid Talib Bey to leave Bellary, and the Government of the United Provinces have been asked to supply the Governor in Council with information as to the character and position of Abdul Haq. In view of these various incidents the Government of Madras would find it convenient to know whether Talib Bey is to be regarded as a person under suspicion and liable, therefore, should the need arise, to close supervision and jestriction upon his movements.

In reply to your letter No. 1125—5, dated the 1st August 1915, I am ^directed to state, for the information of the Governor in Council, that Saiyid Talib Bey should certainly be regarded as a person under suspicion. I.am to add that, as Saiyid Talib Bey cannot be trusted to keep aloof ffrom political intrigues, he should not be permitted, under penalty of losing his liberty and his allowance, to receive visitors with regard to whose motives the Government.of Madras entertain any suspicion.(Copy) Political Department.

In conseouence of the Eutropion, the eyelashes were rubbing on the eyeballs and would have led to irttceraticn and destruction of the eyesight. In all such cases an operation Is imperative, 2, The reasons why the Sheikh was not sent to the hosnltal were (a) that there is no orivate ward in the hospital and he objected very strongly to going into a general ward with other oatients and (b) that he could not effectively be kept under surveillance in the general wards of the hospital without putting a regular guard of Police constaolee over him, which the Bombay City Police could not spare Wfing to shortage of men, aijd which, considering that he was a political dit#nu t wa8 not thought desirable, 3.

On the 12th instant, a Sidi giving the name of Salim Mubarak was brought by the Sheikh to Inspector Khan Saheb M.P Taki of the C. I. D. The Sheikh said that the Sidi was one of his men and that he had sent him back to Ohibaish, when he himself was under arrest at v^uruch, to fetch money and certain articles of clothing and that after many wanderings the Sidi had just run him to earth in Bombay. According to the Sheikh, when he was arrested at Griibaisii and brought down to *uruch, he was accompanied by five body servants. With the permission of Sir Percy Cox, the five servants went back to Chibaish to fetcn money and clotnin^ for their master. The servants in due course returned from Chibaish to ^uruch, only to find that their master nad been spirited away no one knew whither. They proceeded to Basra, where they were told to try Mohammerah. There they were advised to enquire at Abadan. At Abadan they were told the Sheikh was at Fao, so they returned to Fao. At Fao they decided to split up; four of their number proceeded into Persia, where they are doubtless still searching for tneii master, while the fifth set out to draw Bushire. This man was Salim Mubarak and luckily for the Sheikh, he retained possession of the clothes and some of the money, naving swindled out of £ 40/- by an Arab named Syed Hamid at Mohammerah who promised, for that sum, to take him to his master. At Bushire an Arab named Abdul Aziz promised to help him for £ 20/-, and took him to Karachi, where he took him into a ship for Bombay, saw him landed, took him to BhendyBhendy Bazar and there deserted hiun After wandering about the city for one day, the Sidi met some one who could understand his language, and sc he found his way to Shoikli Salim’s house. He still had the Sheikh's clothes, hut of the £ 100/- he started with only Rs. 50 remainedc w Yours sincerely, Sd. S. M. Mwardes. P. S.

In reply, I am to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of the report received from the Commissioner of Police, No*1946-M-158, dated the 23rd April 1915, in which he strongly advocates that the treatment accorded to the Sheikh should remain as at present and that he should not be placed in close intern ment. The Government of Bombay are unable to accept in their entirety all the arguments and anticipations con tained in the report. At the same time, however, it is 3 clear that for the present, at any rate, the Sheikh is not likely to be able to do any harm in Bombay under the | conditions in which he is living there. It may be admitt ed that there appears to be a reasonable likelihood that the Sheikh may become attached to the British cause, and as he is a man of influenece in his own country his conversion might be of value in the future. The Governor in Council would, therefore, propose that he may be n in Bombay pending further developments If India, Foreign SecretaryIf, however, he'should he found to he guilty of any intrigue.

Then you ordered it to return to Suk-es-Shuyukh, I don’t know why. Afterwards we asked you to place with us 2 guns and some rifles for the defence of the Euphrates. But you have not yet ordered this. This means either that you are not thinking about us, or that you don’t want to protect us. VVe fear that the enemy will approach Kurna and that you will leave the Euphrates without defences, and that our lives will be in danger. “ We hav e plenty of Mujahids, but our armament is unimportant. Therefore, please send quickly either arms and guns, or else the gunboat “Marmaris.” ' We are waiting for an immediate reply.” AWr.—This looks as if it was expected that the “ Marmaris ” could navigate the Euphrates. IV. Telegram from Salim-el-Khayy 00 m, Chief of the Beni Assad tribe, to Javid Pasha, dated QUth December igij. “ Unfortunately, it is undesirable, at the present day, to use threat or affront to any Muhammadan, for that will lead him to treachery and deprive him (of the privilege of) helping the Islamic religion. So, if it is your intention to see any treachery on my part, I will not use it, by God, even if I be disappointed in every respect. I am a Muslim and my fidelity is proved since the times of my father and grandfather. How do you presume that I will change fidelity to perfidy ? By God, I shall not flinch from helping the Islamic religion and my dear Govern ment even if I am burned up. As to my cowardice, this is contradicted by the history of the Muslims, because the help afforded by the Beni Assad to the Islamic religion and their bravery are recorded since ancient times; and, now, if you observe justice and uphold conscience, you will, too, testify to them. When we discussed in the Naval Commander’s place, l asked Your Excellency to keep the troops on the battle-line till morning (saying) that I and my tribes men would then resume the battle; and I undertook to safeguard the country. You withdrew the force at night-time, however, and the enemy entered without our knowledge. Again, when l was with you on board the ship during the day and requested you to land guns for Basreh, saying that I would undertake to protect the place and that you should go where you liked, you answered :—“ It is not desirable for you to remain in your place” and you ordered the man-of-war to remain with me for protecting the Euphrates. I ask you, by God, to say if this was not so. How did I then prove cow’ard? ” As to your desire for my presence at Gurneh, 1 ask you, by God, whether I did not explain the treachery of its tribes to your Government and whether the annoyance given by them to the soldiers was not explained to us by Subhi Bey in a communication? I went to them personally and spoke to them and admonished them, but in vain. I represented this at that time to Subhi Bey and the communication is extant in original. I represented the question in detail to your Government through Subhi Bey; but now you describe me as having been in common with them in treachery and address me in this way. I also submitted a communication to yourGovernment through the aforesaid individual and requested them to send two officers, two guns and two mitrailleuses, (saying) that l would proceed directly to Basreh by the marshes; but your Government gave us no answer. A copy of the communication and of the telegram (from) Zia have been forwarded to you by me and 1 hope that you have received them.“ As regards your statement that I have seized the arms of the soldiers accord ing to the representations of the Commandant of Nasiriyeh, Saleh Bey, our complaints against him are still extant. Does your conscience accept this (as true;? You should first ascertain as to how many tribes there are between my place and Basreh, and as to how I will seize (the arms) and give no intimation in that connection. By God, if what you allege is true, there is sign of Islamism with me. There are only 6 rifles with me which have been left by Lieutenant Kbedher Effendi and for which 1 have given a receipt. There is, with them, a letter to the Division, which I will have to deliver. They are with me at the time of writing. These are the facts. (: As to your remark that I am a traitor, God forbid this. If such be the case, not a single tribesman will remain under control, while this attitude is adopted towards us, who induce and attract the people and undertake to help in opening the way to Basreh. Although you have overlooked us and considered us as insignificant, you should see us, God willing, (in the true light) when in action and shall notice our sense of honour immediately when we will carry out our desires and will see us how we proceed to take up the defensive against the enemy.” V. A translation of a telegram from Sabri, the telegraph clerk at Chubaish, to the Commandant at Suk-es-Shuyukh, dated 2gth December /330, or 8th January igi5- “Yesterday at 8 o’clock two big men-of-war with 4 gunboats reached Hamar and, after taking Salim Khayyoom on one of the gunboats, went towards Suk-es- Shuyukh, the remainder staying here.

In regard to the future, I am of the opinion that the only course that we can safely take with reference to him is to require him to live in India until the war is ended and civil administration firmly established.

From—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department, Bombay, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. The Bombay Government have held in abeyance orders contained in Foreign and Political Department telegram No. D. S.-218, dated the 19th February 1915, regarding Shaikh Salim Khayyum because the Shaikh is suffer ing from both his eyes and an operation has become necessary, and there must be a lapse of some days before he has sufficiently recovered from the operation to be removed. This Government would be glad if the orders of the Government of India for his internment would be reconsidered on following grounds : (1) Shaikh can scarcely be blamed if information was given to the Turkish authorities prior to his arrest, in view of the fact that he was drawing hi salary from the Turkish Government. The same thing would have been done by any decent patriot no matter to what country he belonged. (2) Shaikh’s action, the Government of Bombay are inclined to con sider, does not deserve any more drastic punishment than that which has already been awarded to him, viz., sudden deportation to foreign city, complete abandonment of house and home for the time being, in addition to surveillance by agents of Foreign police force both by day and by night. (3) Life under constant surveillance in comparatively confined quarters must be a distinct punishment to a man who has been accustomed to full freedom of desert and head of a numerous tribe and it might seem unduly harsh to emphasise his downfall by putting him in camp at Burma, unless ic is proved conclusively that he has acted outrageously since his arrest. In the circumstances it would appear advisable before finally deciding to intern Shaikh, to await the receipt of the detailed report. Up to now, Shaikh has shown himself well disposed and the Bombay Government do not appre hend any danger from his residing in Bombay under arrangements made in accordance with which he is accommodated in a building part of which a trusted Muhammadan Inspector of police occupies. Moreover, his comparative lenient treatment here has had a very beneficial effect on local Arabs and other Musulmans and a promising effect on Shaikh himself and his attitude to us.

The Government cf Bombay have, however, suggested by telegraph that no further measures should be taken against him, on the following grounds. Firstly, he cannot be moved for some days as he has had eye trouble which will necessitate an operation. Secondly, he has suffered sufficiently for his past actions, which, in view of the situation in which he found himself at the time, were perhaps excusable. Thirdly, our lenient treatment of him has favourably impressed other Arabs and he is showing himself amenable and well-disposed.

Tam directed to refer to your telegram No. 74-D. S., dated the 21st Tanu- I am direct t i ral ^ ^o 68-D. S., dated the 19th January 191o. arj ^2 ^ Arrangements havl been made in Bombay for the residence of Sayyid Talib Bey referred to in your telegram of the 21st January, for the internment of Hamid Nusrat and Majid Nusrat, and for the residence of Salim Al Khayyum the“ast three of whom are referred to in your telegram of the 19th January 3 I am now to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a cony of a memorandum by the Commissioner of Police, Bombay, dated the 5th February 1915, dealing with the two men, Sayyid Talib Bey and Salim A1 Khayyum The Government of India will observe that in the opinion of the Commissioner of Police Sayyid Talib Bey is a dangerous character whose removal from Bombay is most desirable. The grounds upon which he has based his opinion are clearly stated in his memorandum and are entit ed to great consideration. The Arab and other Muhammadan population in the City ol Bombay have throughout the present crisis behaved with great discretion and loyalty to the British Government. It would be most unfortunate if, owing to the presence in their midst of an intriguing character, they should become restless or disaffected. There are a large number of Arabs in Bombay, and it seems wise that an intriguing personage such as Tahb Bey should not be im- mediately accessible to them. 4. The Governor in Council would, therefore, request that the Govern ment of India may be moved to issue orders for the removal of Talib Bey from Bombay to another station outside his jurisdiction, as for instance, Madras. 5. The proceedings of Sheikh Salim A1 Khayyum will be closely watched, and it is not improbable that through the influences which the Commissioner of Police is able to bring to bear upon him, he may become a sincere friend of the British Government, Copy of a memorandum dated the 5th February 1915 by the Commissioner of Police, Bombay. So far as we are at present acquainted with the two men, Talib Bey and Sheikh Salim A1 Khayyum, we decidedly prefer the character of the latter. According to Talib’s dependents he is given over wholly to wine and women and was very corrupt in his administration. This estimate of his character is borne out by Arabs, now resident in Bombay, who regard him as a first class “ badmash.” Curiously enough Talib Bey is known to Sub-Inspector Martirosi of the Criminal Investigation Department, who spent two years in Basrah, and this officer reports that he is treacherous and cruel. He states that it was Talib Bey who had Colonel Earid Bey assassinated in Basrah, about the same date that Mahmud Sheoket Pasha was assassinated in Constantinople. Lastly the Pir of Baghdad has sent me a private message to beware of Talih. I think, therefore, on the information given above and on the opinion which my Musalman Criminal Investigation Department officers have formed of him that Talib Bey is the real “ badmash ” and that we should do ourselves no harm if we have him sent to Madras, where the Arab population is compar atively trivial I recommend this course for the further reason that Talib Bey is giving the Pir of Baghdad a good deal of trouble and annoyance. He turns up at the Pir’s house at all hours of the day and night and orders dinner for himself, even if the Pir Saheb is out. The Pir is afraid that he may turn up one day in a drunken condition and disgrace himself, and therefore the Pir also, before the Memons and Arabs who are on visiting terms with the Pir. As I have3 practically held myself responsible in the past for pressing the Fir’s “izzat” so far as a police officer can, I am not anxious that he should be worried by Talib Bey. ^ And taking a survey of the whole situation I do not think it would be a bad plan to give Talib Bey marching orders for Madras, and let him live there. Now as regards Sheikh Salim A1 Khayyum, our impression is that he is a hot-headed child of the jungle. He is absolutely and strictly orthodox praying- five times a day, and is apparently perfectly content to live quietly’ As an Arab he is, I believe, straight. In the hearing of a third party (not a police officer) yesterday he forbade Sheikh Abdul Bahiman to discuss the war or Gulf affairs with him. He has never seen a motor-car, nor a train, nor electric li»ht and fans ; and I consider that we have a very good chance, if he is allowed &amp; to stay here, of completely exercising by friendly treatment any bitterness that may be rankling in his mind against us. I should like to try the experiment and I propose to begin by inviting him to my bungalow on Sunday for an interview. He has left the house of Inspector Khan Saheb F. M. Taki, and we have taken suitable quarters for him in Faiz Manzil, Grant Boad, one floor of which is occupied by a Criminal Investigation Depart ment Sub-Inspector, Sheikh Bahauddin, who is a collateral relative of the Chief of Mangrol. He and Inspector Taki will be responsible for A1 Khayyum’s education, and aided by local Mahommedans, who are well affected towards Government, will, I believe, be able eventually to instil into A1 Khayyum’s mind a clear appreciation of the value of British Buie. He is not, so far as we can tell now, likely to be in the least troublesome, and I certainly think we shall be able to make more of him, if he is left in our charge than if he is exiled to the Deccan and placed under the formal surveillance of the District Police. There is some grounds for thinking that it was on a report or information supplied by Talib Bey that Sheikh Salim was carried off by the Gulf authorities and sent down here ; and considering Talib Bey’s past history and the reputation that he has among the Arabs and the Jews of Basrah, that report may well have been exaggerated, if not wholly false. Anyhow the pair are atjdaggers drawn— the only difference being that Sheikh Salim refuses to slander Talib Bey behind his back. I w^ould therefore suggest that the Sheikh may at any rate for the present be left to us and we will try and make a pro-English Arab of him. I should be glad to see the last of Talib Bey, and so also would the Fir of Baghdad. 4' Telegram P., dated the 16th February 1915.

It is proposed by the Government of India that one Sayyid Talib, lately a man of position in Basrah, who has been sent to India by Sir Percy Cox for political reasons, be transferred to Madras from Bombay. His presence in Bombay is, the Government of Bombay report, undesirable in view of the large Arab community in that Presidency and they therefore urge his removal. The Sayyid receives for his maintenance the sum of Rs. 1,200 a month as a State guest and should therefore be treated as such, but kept under quiet surveillance Arrangements should be made for suitable accommodation if the Governor in Council has no objection to the proposal. Your telegraphic reply is awaited. a / Telegram P., dated the 19th (received 20th) February 1915.

He held rank of Captain under Turkish regime and received salary of H. 80 per mensem as Commander of local river guardl on that section of the Euphrates. He is well known as a clever intriguer and firebrand and, since our occupation of Qurnah, he has been active in endeavouring in association with others to excite tribesmen under his influence on Ihat side to give us trouble. He having neglected specific opportunity afforded him of coming into us and it being certain that until he was eliminated unrest would prevail in that neighbourhood, I was authorized to effect his arrest with a show of force, and this was done. This man is not a criminal and, X think, might be allowed to live at large at Bombay or Poona subject to police supervision. He would need an allowance of about Es. 250 a month which could be sent to him direct by Chief Political Officer recoverable eventu ally from revenues or other sources. He would be Jallowed to return under suitable guarantees at end of War or when firm establishment of our adminis tration admits of it.

It is reported that for political reasons he has been deported from Basrah. Nothing* is known about Nuri Bey. According to his own statement he was a military cadet at Constantinople and friendly with Aziz Ali Bey, who was sentenced to death prior to the declaration of war by young Turkish party but reprieved at ins- tance of British Ambassador. After leaving Constantinople Nuri Bey went to Basrah to stay with Talib Bey, whom he describes as pro-British in sentiment later of the young Turk and a Turk of the old school. Information has been received by the Commissioner of Police that although pro-British, Talib Bey is an unscrupulous villain who is feathering his own nest and with a band of cut-throats was looting indiscriminately. Arrangements have been made to feed and accommodate Nuri Bey who has no money and to treat him in the same manner as Salim A1 Khayyum.

With reference to your telegram No. 68-D. S., dated the 19th instant, regarding the three Arabs sent from Basrah on the S.S. “ Varsova,” I am direct ed to make the following report:— 2. The two brothers, Hamid Nusrat and Majid Nusrat, have been interned in the Byculla Jail in Bombay.4 3. Arrangements have been made to house Shaikh Salim al Khayyam in a suitable manner. On the arrival of the Transport \ arsova seven sovereigns belonging to the Shaikh were handed over to the police officer who went on board to take charge of him. This amount represents all the funds the Shaikh is in possession of at present. He has written a letter in Arabic to one Saleh Al Hajjaj at Basrah, a free translation of which I am to enclose m for the information of the Government of India. 4. Arrangements will be made to house him suitably in some up-country station. Dear Sir Saleh Al Hajjaj, After enquiring your health, I wish to state that after starting from Fao on Thursday, I reached Bombay on Tuesday. On my arrival here Govern ment sent their officers in motor cars to receive me and I was landed with utmost honour and due respect and was treated with great humanity and provided with lodgings, servants, and all necessities. This is due to the writings of the British Agent at Irak, so I thank both parties. At present I am in excellently good condition and liberty. I wish, by the grace of God, that their kindness should continue till I return safely to my native country and then to render them good services for what they have kindly done towards me. I hope you will convey my report of safe arrival here as also of my happy • state. It would be better to send Ahmed Az-Zib with a servant accompany ing him, and also to send some thin (light) “Bashoots” (robes), for the climate here is very warm and which should suit the climate here. And if they wish to send any money, they can do so by Hundi or English pounds. It is not necessary for me now to insist on you the sending of this letter on to them. I have already instructed Yoonoos and Ali when I was at Basrah, and they should not make any delay in the matters I spoke to them and they should always be at the British Agency. They should not be anxious about me. I am here much pleased with the treatment of Government. I ask you all to look after my house and the family. If they want to send any servant, money, or letter about health, they should consult or do so through Colonel Cox, the British Agent; so do I through Government when writing to them. Compliments to each and all friends. (Sd.) Salim-Al-Khaytttm. 2 U /&lt;?- No. aio-W ^ dated Delhi, the 4th February 1915. 21d Endorsed by Foreign and Political Department.

Since his arrival, Nuri Bey has struck up a friendship with a large number of Arabs, and is also on terms of intimacy with Saiyid Talib, whose removal from Bombay has been suggested to Government of India. A Police officer has seen Nuri Bey surrounded by a number of Parsis on a road side and explaining to them with map of war in his hands. On seeing the Police officer Nuri Bey deposited the map and walked away. This Government is not sufficiently sure of Nuri Bey’s bom fides to be able to risk possibility of intrigue with Arabs and others and his removal to an up-country station, j selected by Bombay Government, is recommended.

T nm directed to refer to your telegram No. 74-D. S., dated the 21st January 1915, and to your telegram No. 68-D. S, dated the 19th January 1915 2 Arrangements have been made in Bombay for the residence of Saiyid Talih Bey referred to in your telegram of the 21st January, for the internment of Hamid Nusrat and Majid Nusrat, and for the residence of Salim A1 Khayyum, the last three of whom are referred to in your telegram of the 19th January. 3 I am now to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a memorandum by the Commissioner of Police, Bombay, dated the 5th February 1915, dealing with the two men, Saiyid Talib Bey and Salim A1 Khayyum ‘The Government of India will observe that, in the opinion of the Commissioner of Police, Saiyid Talib Bey is a dangerous character whose removal from Bombay is most desirable. The grounds upon which he has based his opinion are clearly stated in his memorandum and are entitled to oreat consideration. The Arab and other Muhammadan population in the City of Bombay have, throughout the present crisis, behaved with great dis cretion and loyalty to the British Government. It would be most unfortunate if owino- to the presence in their midst of an intriguing character, they should become restless or disaffected. There are a large number of Arabs in Bombay, and it seems wise that an intriguing personage, such as Talib Bey, should not be immediately accessible to them. 4. The Governor in Council would, therefore, request that the Government of India may be moved to issue orders for the removal of Talib Bey from Bombay to another station outside his jurisdiction, as, for instance, Madras. 5. The proceedings of Shaikh Salim A1 Khayyum will be closely watched, and it is not improbable that through the influences which the Commissioner of Police is able to bring to bear upon him, he may become a sincere friend of the British Government.Copy of a memorandum dated the oih February 1915 by the Commissioner of Police, Bombay. So far as we are at present acquainted with the two men Talib Bey and Shaikli Salim A1 Khayyum, we decidedly prefer the character of the latter. According to Talib’s dependents he is given over wholly to wine and women and was very very corrupt in his administration. This estimate of his character is borne out by Arabs, now resident in Bombay, who regard him as a first class “ badmash.” Curiously enough Talib Bey is known to Sub-Inspec tor Martirosi of the Criminal Investigation Department, who spent, two years in Basr»h, and this officer reports that he is treacherous and cruel. He states ; that it was Talib Bey who had Colonel Parid Bey assassinated in Basrah, about the same date that Mahmud Sheoket Pasha was assassinated in Constantinople. 1 Lastly the Pir of Baghdad has sent me a private message to beware of Talib. I think, therefore, on the information given above and on the opinion which my Musalman Criminal Investigation Department officers have informed of him, that Talib Beg is the real “ badmash ” and that we should do ourselves no harm if we have him sent to Madras, where the Arab population is comparatively trivial. I recommend this course for the further reason that Talib Beg is giving the Pir of Baghdad a good deal of trouble and annoyance. He turns up at the Pir’s house at all hours of the dav and night and orders dinner for him- self, even if the Pir Saheb is out. The Pir is afraid that he may turn up one day in a drunken condition and disgrace himself, and therefore the Pir also before the Memons and Arabs who are on visiting terms with the Pir. As I have practically held myself responsible in the past for pressing the Pir’s “ Izzat ,” so far as a police officer can, I am not anxious that he should be worried by Talib Bey. And taking a survey of the whole situation I do not think it would be a bad plan to give Talib Bey marching orders for Madras, and let him live there. Now, as regards Shaikh Salim A1 Khayyum, our impression is that he is | a hot-headed child of the jungle. He is absolutely and strictly orthodox, ) praying five times a day, and is apparently perfectly content to live quietly. As an Arab he is, I believe, straight. (Jn the hearing of a third party (not a police officer) yesterday he forbade Shaikh Abdul Bakiman to discuss the war or Gulf affairs with him. He has never seen a motor-car, nor a train, nor | electric light and fans ; and I consider that we have a very good chance, if he is allowed to stay here, of completely exorcising by friendly treatment any bitterness that may be rankling in his mind against us. I should like to try the experiment, and I propose to begin by inviting him to my bungalow on Sunday for an interview. He has left the house of Inspector Khan Saheb P. M. Taki, and we have taken suitable quarters for him in Paiz Manzil, Grant Hoad, one floor of which is occupied by a Criminal Investigation Department Sub-Inspector, Sheikh Bahauddin, who is a collateral relative of the Chief of Mangrol. He and Inspector Taki will be responsible for Al Khayyum’s educa tion, and aided by local Mohammedans, who are well affected towards Govern ment, will, I believe, be able eventually to instil into Al Khayyum’s mind a clear appreciation of the value of British Buie. He is not, so far as we can tell now, likely to be in the least troublesome, and I certainly think we shall be able to make more of him, if he is left in our charge than if he is exiled to the Deccan and placed under the formal surveillance of the District Police. There is some ground for thinking that it was on a report or information j supplied by Talib Bey that Shaikh Salim was carried off by the Gulf authori- ^ ties and sent down here: and considering Talib Bey’s past history and the reputation that he has among the Arabs and the Jews of Basrah, that report may well have been exaggerated, if not wholly false. Any how the pair are at dagger drawn, the only difference being that Shaikh Salim refuses to slander Talib Bey behind his back. I would, therefore, suggest that the Shaikh may. at any rate for the present, be left to us and we will try and make a pro-English Arab of him. I should be glad to see the last of Talib Bey, and so also would the Pir of Baghdad.Telegram No. 253-B., dated (and received) the 13th February 1915.

Your telegram of the 23rd instant, Arabs i/i Mesopo- amia. Information regarding Turkish intrigues with Bin Sand, and their esult and latter s intention to attack Bin Kashid was conveyed in our telegrams of 15 th December 1914 and 13th January 1915. Before re port hm fm t ier as to Bin Sand’s attitude 1 was awaiting result of telegraphic corres pondence uith (ox regarding proposed conclusion of treaty with Bin Sand a )ou wik 1 shall very shortly address you. In this connection Cox telegraphed, 16th January \ llltiinatel Y disappointed of our intervention in his behalf in April Jdl 4 he was obliged to come to an understanding with Turks sufficient to secure his immunity from their aggression. His hopes of material support were somewhat revived by intimation in October 1914 that Captain s! was being deputed to him with message from British Government, but without possessing a definite treaty with us he could not in any case have responded in a direct way to our later request that he should advance on Basra even had there been time. Failing that, however, he endeavoured to take such a me ol action, as would indirectly further our policy without bringiim him irrevocably to a rupture with Turkey. . “ Neither can he now commit himself any further until he possesses a signed treaty giving him a solid guarantee of his position under the cvgis of Gloat Britain. He is already embarrassed by difficulty of his present position. If the treaty is not soon concluded he fears force of circumstances may drive him to give some overt demonstration of his intention to side with lurks. On the other hand directly it is concluded he can be depended on to come off the fence and use all his resources and influence on our side.” Bin Sand is reported to be on his way, personally, to attack Bin Rashid and hopes to round him up by the end of January. Shakespear remains with him. Our assurances to Bin Saud were conditional on his cooperating with Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammera in capture of Basra, or failing thab on his arranging to prevent Turkish assistance reaching Basra and safe guarding European lives and property there. ' He did not fulfil these conditions and assurances are no longer operative without the conclusion of a further treaty with Bin Sand. As regards Sayyid Talib, Cox reported on 15th January that he was now entirely submissive and realised that Basra was not the place for him and was anxious to find haven elsewhere under British protection, (’ox considers his presence on Shat-el-Arab at present undesirable.

It is better to leave matter entirely in hands of Sir p. cox who will soon see Talib. rJANIQlS^SKYYBD TALIR hf.Y. Seyyid Talib Bey, aged about 40, is the youngest son of Seyyed Rejeb Bey, Nakib of Basra. The family have been established in Basra and Bagdad for some seven centuries and are Arabs. I do not know their origin. Nakib (lit. Herald in Arabic) is an old feudal title given to the chief of the landed gentry. I understand it has also some religious signification. There is a cousin of the same family who is Nakib of Bagdad. They may be regarded as the leading and most important family of Basra, and Seyyed Rejeb is a rich man with considerable landed property near Basra. He does not mix up much in politics himself, nor do his other sons, one of whom Seyyed Yusuf or Hashim owns the property occupied by the German Consulate at Basra, Seyyed Talib Bey however is the spoilt boy of the family and has, since the Constitution, posed as the champion of Arab reforms in Mesopotamia and headed the so- called Arab liberal movement in Basra in opposition to the ruthless Turkifying policy of the Committee of Union and Progress. His house was the rallying point for all Arab mal contents, who were dissatisfied with the proceedings of the Committee Government. As regards his previous history he was Mutessarif of Hassa in 1902 and made money. There is no doubt that he used his official influence to this end and many complaints were made about him by other wealthy Arabs whom he mulcted. When the Constitution was proclaimed he became ParliamentaryParliamentary deputy for Basra and retained his seat in all subsequent elections until he resigned it last year owing to his enmity with Talaat Bey, Minister of the Interior. His local influence enabled him to engineer the parliamentary elections as he liked, and the Basra deputies at the last and previous election were all Seyyed Talib Bey's men. He was an ardent supporter of the liberal party as opposed to the Committee and has of recent years been in bad odour at Constantinople owing to his extreme views on the subject of Arab reform. He tried hard to induce the Central Government to grant the Arabs some measure of independent administra tion and had several splits with Talaat Bey in regard to the formation of the National Council. The Committee who practised the cult of assassina tion appeared to think it worth their while to get rid of him and I ha,ve good reason to believe that a determined attempt was made to assassinate him in 1913. But he was too clever for the Turks and, taking time by the forelock, adopted measures which rendered the scheme abortive; and Perid Bey, the Military Commandant of Basra, who was entrusted with the task, was killed un expectedly without accomplishing his mission. ^ Seyyed Talib Bey made his influence felt with all Turkish Valis who were changed thirteen times in as many years. A new Vali soon discovered that he could not get on without him and latterly he was the virtual ruler oi Basra. He is an intimate friend of the Sheikhs of Mohammera and Koweit and the former frequently gave him moneymoney end lent him men to cope with his adversaries for he was often in difficulties. At the same time the Sheikhs mentioned endeavoured to restrain hi® ardour and advised him to curb his ambition, expressing the opinion that he was riding for a fall. Of recent years Seyyed Talib Bey frequently appealed to His Majesty’s Government through me for assistance in his schemes for Arab emancipation, and I think his idea generally was to transform Basra into a sort of autonomous Pashalik on the Lebanese pattern with himself as the'central figure. His Majesty’s Government however discouraged him and, acting on Embassy instructions, my invariable reply to his repeated requests for our help and intervention was to the effect that, as a British official, I could not interfere in the internal politics of Turkey. Personally I have sometimes doubted whether he possessed as much real influence among the Arabs as he led me to suppose. His influence with the rich at Basra was based rather on fear than affection for he had a way of his own in working his will. But he had the devil’s own luck and usually accomplished his purpose. If friendly appeal for money failed he did not hesitate to resort to com pulsion and was not hampered by a scrupulous conscience. On the other hand he was beloved by the poor and his own retainers, whom he treated magnanimously, and most people found out sooner or later that it was better to be on his side than against him. I consider him no more sincere th an any ot her Arab and he has, of course, his own axe to grind. But the conditioncondition of things in the Turkish province, and notably in Basra, after the advent of the Conirnittee to power, was unexampled and the Arabs were sorely tried by their Turkish rulers. he certainly stood up boldly for them and broke many lances on their behalf. His own life was constantly in jeopardy and he had little fear. His argument to me used to be that, with British help, the Arabs could emancipate themselves but not otherwise. He may very well have told the same tale to the Russian Consul, mutatis mutandis, but I have no proof of it. He is mixed up in the usual blood feuds and family intrigues common to all Arabs of distinction and was K latterly on bad terms with Ajeymi, the tioVtific chieftain, owing to the death of Sadun Pasha, Ajeymi’s father at the hands of the Turks in 1911. Ajeymi appeared to hold him responsible for the event and charged him with having deliberately betrayed his father to the Turks but, as far as I could gather on my return to Basra, for I was absent when it occurred, the accusation was unfounded. In any case most of the recent disturbances in Basra were primarily due to Seyyed Talib Bey's quarrels with the Moat ific faction. It is rather difficult to summarise his character. His chief characteristic was his versatility. He was certainly the dominant factor in Basra politics during my tenure of office for 12 years and was quite the most interesting personality I met there. I should call him restless - a stormy petrel - but shrewd. He has undoubted intelligence and knows how and when to seize his opportunities. AsAs a maxi he was head and shoulders above his compatriots but the Basra riverain Arabs are the scum of Asia and I may have formed an exaggerated opinion of his mentality by comparison. He has the Arab temperament, fierce and boastful, but he seemed to me to act where others only talked, twisted the Turkish officials round his fingers and had the courage of his convictions. He has, of course, the usual limitations of his race and class. He is generous with a purpose and, although he had no wealth, generally managed to raise money by fair means or foul but always with humour. Seyyed Talib Bey drinks heavily, is fond of women and cards and is generally a bon-vivant but, for an Arab, he is young and active for his years and has immense energy. His energies, if rightly directed, might, I am con vinced, prove a valuable asset in the regeneration and development of Mesopotamia under happier auspices. I cannot help admiring him as an ambitious man who held his own in the face of great difficulties and fierce opposition for many years, but I am unaware whether recent events have caused him to modify his attitude towards us. Mr. Bullard will no doubt be able to supply more recent information as I left Basra in May 1914. (Signed) P. E. Crow. His Majesty’s Consul, Basra.

From—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London, To—His Excellency the Viceroy (Foreign and Political Department), Delhi. A scheme has been formed by Asiz Bey el Masri to start revolution backed by small force well equipped in Mesopotamia, nucleus of which force would be procured from Mesopotamian army which has been tampered with already. Arab Chiefs could rally round this centre and ultimately Aziz Bey el Masri hopes to recruit forty thousand or fifty thousand men, but will require a guarantee from us of funds, arms and warlike material for these eventually. In the meantime Cheetham has been instructed by the Foreign Office to offer Aziz Bey el Masri help of £2,000 and send him there to organise. Foreign Office desire action to be taken by His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah on the following telegram from Cheetham dated November 16th, which is as follows :—As the result of an interview Aziz Bey says that before he can formulate a definite plan he must be in communication with his friends in Mesopotamia in order to ascertain the actual state of affairs. It is sug gested by him, as regards mode of communication, that Consul at Mohammerah should be instructed to find out whereabouts of a certain Arab Turkish officer whose name is Nuri-el-Saad. If Consul is not able to do this he should make endeavour to trace one Doctor Abdullah or a certain civilian named Muzahimel Amin. If they cannot be traced their whereabouts will be known to a certain Talib Bey of Basrah, but they will in all probability be found at Basrah or if not there at Kowait or Mohammerah. They should be informed that. “ friends of theirs staying in Egypt ” desire to correspond with them by telegraph in order to learn the actual state of affairs.

S. and D. S.-I02 dated the 22nd and 28th November, respectively. I have got in touch with, and had a confidential interview with Nouri Saeed. Muzahim El Amin is also in Basrah. Doctor Abdulla has gone to Bin Sand and so has Sayyid Talib u a ter stopped on his way at Koweit and undertook to advise Bin Saud in accordance with British interests, and apparently satisfied Political Agent and m e l 1 that he was only going there in order to save his face with Ur's. ou ri Saeed, who appears to me to be primarily a visionary socialist, fi 6 ? Arab youth of about 25 years of age, suffering from some affection chest, and is highly Europeanised. The scheme of himself and his ass cm es seems to be mainly to raise to better things the Arab nation generally, and at orar having occupied Basrah he expressed delight on the ground that3 Arabs would achieve their ideals more easily under liberal British rule than any other, ^ouii Saeed said that it was in the hope of inspiring the Arabs of Irak with national ambitions of his party that he had come to Basrah and they had entered into relations with Sayyid Talib for the reason that some of them had met him in Constantinople and were of opinion that he would be able to put them in touch with tribal notables. In reply to question as to what his present plans were, and if and how he wished to co-operate with us, he stated that he thought that if we intended to advance farther in the course of time he might be able to help by converting and detaching from the army some of Djavid Pasha’s officers, also that if he travelled in Euphrates vallev he might in the course of time be able to win over some of the tribal Sheikhs to his ideals, and persuade them that under British rule they were more likely to achieve them and should accept it accordingly. I regard scheme as visionary and impracticable. 1 am sure that in the backward condition of the tribes and Sheikhs with whom they w^ould have to deal the “ young Arabs ” and their propaganda would not have the slightest effect on them. 3 In any case they might do more harm than good and would be of no immediate use to us. I recommend that, until situation has cleared, Aziz El Masri be overawed from leaving Egypt. The foregoing observations envisage possibility in near future of advance on Baghdad. Keeping in view the same contingency, the immediate situation appears to me to be as follows. We are on the point of attacking and occupy ing Gurneh, which in any case must, for effective security of Basrah, be held permanently. It is probable when we have accomplished this, that remainder of Basrah force wffiich is now at Ezra’s tomb with Djavid and “Marmaris” will retire to Kut El Amara. We might in that eventuality expect to gain without bloodshed and by negotiation possession of Amara and so on by stages to Baghdad : our communications being made good as we go. We have nothing to fear from populace of Baghdad and there is good reason to hope that once we are in control over Baghdad and river and telegraph to Basrah, tribes in Euphrates valley over whom influence of Mohammerah, Koweit, and other friendlies will have meanwhile been exercised will accept our regime automa tically. The tribes on Euphrates route are multitudinous and warlike, and any use of that route would inevitably involve shedding of good deal of tribal blood w r hich will not soon be forgotten, besides being a big and difficult undertaking. There does not appear to be any likelihood that they would go so far as to come over to Tigris to oppose us, or that if they did so they could trouble us much. Interesting comment on situation is afforded by the fact that argument is already being used by our supporters that the tribes will certainly come under Russian control from north of a much less benevolent character if they do not accept our control from south. 8 Telegram P., dated the 4th (received 5th) December 1914.

Please refer to Foreign and Political Department telegram No. D. S-77, lated the 22nd November; which owing to line of telegraph being down reached me very late and very much mutilated. By occupation of Bussorah situation seemed to me quite changed and I thought that if still necessary any enquiries for the individuals mentioned would have to be made there. Sayyid Talib is at Koweit and so iar as I know none of them have been at Mohammerah. In the circumstances I beg to say that I am unable to make any useful report. I communicated with Sir P.

El Mazri. A reference is invited to your telegrams of 19th and 27th November, respectively. Of friends in Mesopotamia mentioned by El Mazri, Er. Abdulla has joined Bin Saud. Nuri Saad and Muzahim el Amin are in Basra. Sayyid Talib has also gone to Bin Saud and is utterly untrustworthy (please see my tele gram of 20th November 1914). Sir P. Cox has interviewed Nun Saad and reports that he is a delicate Arab youth of about 25 years of age apparently a visionary socialist, and highly Europeanised. The ultimate aim of his party is to raise the Arab nation to better things which they think will be achieved more easily under liberal British rule. In reply to questions as to what his present plans were, and if and how he wished to co-operate with us, he stated that he thought that if we intended to advance further, in ^ course of time he might be able to help by converting some of Ejavid Pasha’s officers, and also that if he travelled in Euphrates Valley he might in course of time be able to win over some tribal Sheikhs to his ideals. This scheme I regard as unlikely to materialise both owing to quality of leaders and because those Sheikhs and tribes which are concerned are too backward to pay attention to “ Young Arab ” propaganda. Much of course must depend on attitude of Bin Saud. In the event of Arab revolution under his leadership appearing imminent and spontaneous, I think we should assist it with money. But until situation declares itself more clearly I consider our co-operation premature at the present juncture. 12 Telegram P., dated the 8th December 1914.

General Officer Commanding and I did not consider proposal could be seriously entertained. He is now anxious to proceed to Baghdad where he says his parents are ; as he is known to Turkish ^ authorities it is obviously only possible for him to proceed there as a Turkish subject and Turkish officer, and for this reason I doubt whether he would be of any use as a spy. If however he cannot be allowed to proceed there we must give him some allowance against letting him remain at large here.

Reference your telegram No. 69-B., dated the 16th January 1915. With a view to sealing Bin Saud’s allegiance to us the Government of India agree that conclusion of a treaty with him is urgently necessary. A detailed treaty however on the lines that are suggested by Bin Saud himself and is commented on by you is fraught with many difficulties, e g-, jurisdiction over Moslem British subjects, boundaries, dynastic guarantee. Is it not possible for a preliminary treaty to be concluded somewhat on the lines of the treaty with Afghanistan to the following effect:— (♦) British Government recognise Bin Saud as independent ruler of Nejd, Hasa and Katif. (ii) In event of unprovoked aggression on his territories by any Foreign Power, British Government are prepared to aid Bin Saud, to such extent and in such manner as may appear necessary to British Government, in repelling it. (in) In return Bin Saud agrees to have no dealings with any other power or to grant concessions to the subjects of any other power except on the advice of the British Government which advice he will unreservedly follow. (iv) Further the British Government and Bin Saud agree to conclude as soon as this can be conveniently arranged a detailed treaty in regard to other matters which jointly concern them.2 The Government of India propose, if you agree, that a treaty on these lines is advisable and Bin Sand is likely to accept it, to make recommendations accordingly to His Majestv’s Secretary of State for India. Ho you consider it desirable that we should make a present of money contingent on conclusion of treaty as earnest of our friendly intentions?

Cox, K.C.I.E., C S I, Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf, dated the 17th Muharram 1333 (5th December 1914). After compliments. Let it not he hidden from you that some days ago Sayid Talib-an-Naqib came to me here at Buraidah. His coming is due to the state of Turkish affairs and to the high-handed treatment that he had received at the hands of the Turks during the last two years, and then to the arrival of Javid at Basrah, and the fact that under the guise of warlike measures the Turks started pursuing their personal motives against him—motives which it is difficult to explain except verbally at interview. Placing his trust in the old relations subsisting between us and his family generally and particularly between him and myself personally, Saiyyid Talib managed to secure a mission for himself from the Inspector of Turkish War affairs some 20 days before his departure, and this mission enabled him to leave Basrah and afforded him from molestation by any body. He is now in my company and we are proceeding to your side. I have received a letter from my friend Captain Shakespear asking me to see him, and I have written him a reply appointing a place for our meeting. On our meeting I shall explain to him matters wdiich no doubt he will report to you and which concern the interests of the Arab race and the confirmation of the old relations between us and the high British Government. We still abide by our old relations and nothing will change our attitude but things that may be harmful to our religion and the Arab race. You are the best of people with regard to this matter and avc hope from you every good. As regards the dealings of Saiyyid Talib with us and with you, they are not accord ing to what has been made out by mischievous people from motives of self- interest. The truth will become apparent, and he is one of the people who deserve respect and consideration. We have now arrived at a place called Mustavi, and have heard of your arrival at Basrah and of the occupation of the place by the British troops and of the just and good treatment and consideration you have shown to the populace. This makes me all the more thankful. As I have (at Basrah) my trusted people deserving of respect like Abdul Latif-al-Mandail and his family, I thought it fit to make this known to you. I shall he thankful if you will kindly keep in mind there and all my subjects belonging to Nejd and now residing in the districts of Basrah and Zubair. Complimentary ending.3 Enclosure No. 2, Serial No. 4. Translation of a letter to Amir Abdul Aziz bin Abdur Rahman Al Faisal “ Bin Saudf dated the 29th Muharram 1333, corresponding to 17th December 1914. After compliments —Your honoured letter of 17th Muharram 1333 has reached me in a fortunate hour here at Kurna, by the hand of our friend Abdul Latif ibn Mandil. I was very glad to get it and also to receive your expression of satisfaction at learning of our occupation of Basrah and the Shatt-al-Arab, and of the contentment of the inhabitants. Since then our troops have occupied Kurna. The place is conveniently situated for defence, and up to a certain point the Turks fought their guns well, but ultimately they gave up the fight, and nearly 1,200 of them were made prisoners, and altogether upwards of 20 guns have so far been captured from them. It is not hidden from you that the British Government had no wish to go to war with Turkey, but her hostile actions, resulting from the intrigues and incitement of Germany, were so intolerable that we had no alternative. But as we have explained to the people of Basrah and Kurna, it is the” Government of Turkey only with which we are at war, and we have no object against the people of the country and the Arabs. On the contrary we wish to be their friends and supporters and hope that under the British flag they will enjoy the utmost freedom and justice both in regard to their religion and their secular affairs. Especially in regard to religious matters you need be under no sort of apprehension. It is not hidden from you that the British Government has more Muhammadan subjects than any other Government, and you will have seen from the Proclamation, of which I enclose a printed copy, that we have expressly undertaken to respect and preserve the holy places of pilgrimage both in the Hejaz and Mesopotamia. As for yourself I hope that as the result of what has happened your affairs will prosper more than before, because your territory will become free from that annoyance and interference on the part of the Turks from which you have suffered hitherto. As regards your friend Saiyyid Talib, I met his esteemed father at Basrah and told him what was in my mind regarding his son, and it was to this effect. Up to the declaration of war he did not cease to make claims to us which were not possible of acceptance, and did not agree to the favourable terms offered to him ; yet the British Government is forgiving, and though Saiyyid Talib has been ill-advised and misled yet neither the Government nor I, its representative, have any ill-will against Saiyyid Talib. But what I thought was necessary in his case was that, for reasons which you will unaerstand, it would be better that he should not return to Basrah for a time until the affairs and the inhabitants of the town had settled down. A little later I shall be quite ready to see him and talk over his affairs, with him, and if then his attitude is satisfactory and he submits to the wishes of the Government, may be able to recommend his being allowed to return to Basrah on suitable terms. I hope by the time this reaches you our friend Captain Shakespear will be with you, and he will inform me of what passes between you, and you may be sure that they will he regarded by myself and the Bnfash Government wrth all sympathy. In the meanwhile, inshallah, we shall not fail to show consideration to your friends and dependents such as Ibn Mandil in Basrah and Zubair. Enclosure No. 3, Serial No. 4. Translation of a letter from Abdul Aziz bin Sand, dated the 22 nd Muharram 1333, corresponding to the 10th December 1914. After compliments .— I have already sent you a Ifer informing you that I am on my way to this side and that I am awaiting Captain Shakespear s4 arrival for a meeting as desired by him. I also informed you regarding the comma- 0 f Saiyyid Talib Naqib to me, and his good intentions which are for your interests and not in any way opposed thereto. I informed you that at our meeting I would explain to you what it was necessary to explain. The reason ^ for comm* was to strengthen the foundation of friendship and sincerity and to ^ explain the facts about the said Saiyyid for whom I have a great regard, and in whose sincerity and right-mindedness, which is the result of his knowledge and friendship with you, X place confidence. And because the said Captain has not arrived here up to now, X am obliged to await him here as I do not know what time he might come. I have therefore found it necessary to send you Haji Sulaiman Eaizi with the letter and have asked to explain to you my own and Saiyyid Talib’s views, and I tell you with all clearness that Saiyyid Talib has been a friend to you for a long time. He has also known my views and has con stantly warned me against the Turks and urged on me the necessity of relations with you and of friendship with you. Now as regards his intercourse with the Turks during the war, which was assumed out of fear lest his family and depend ents should suffer from their treachery and deceit. This will no doubt be forgiven him just as he will not be forgiven if after your occupation of Basrah he be guilty of any act against you. Believe me that if he gives you an undertaking he will never violate it, and profit will accrue from it in future. He has in fluence with the chief people among the Muhammadans and Arabs, and he is one of the sincere people and I endorse whatever undertaking he gives you. If this suits you and you think it suitable to call him to Basrah and to please his mind with what is suitable for the dignity of the high British Government, I shall thereby be greatly obliged and thank your kindness and my attachment will increase. This will give great satisfaction to the Arab public. They will believe that this act is an example for others. I request you not to pay atten tion to the talk of lying jealous individuals who had a good deal to do with him and me before. I request an early and favourable reply by the hands of the bearer of this letter. Enclosure No. 4, Serial No. 4. Translation of a letter from Saiyyid Talib, Naqibzadah, to Sir P. Z. Cox, Political Officer with the Indian Expeditionary Force, dated the 22nd Muharram 1333, corresponding to the 10th December 1914. After compliments. —Let it not be hidden from you that two years ago when I, like the other Arab vilayats, asked for reforms in our towns (province), the Turkish Government accused me of being inclined towards your good Government. From that time the Turkish Government has suspected me and its mind has been poisoned against me. Owing to this, my confidence in the Government disappeared, so much so that I had to go in fear of my life. I had been communicating with your high Government before the declaration of war through Shaikh Khazal Khan, the Consul at Muhammerah, and the Consul at Basrah, and the result of the communications then held is not hidden from you. My communications with the British Government were held not only then but before then also, viz., with Lord Kitchener when he was in Egypt. When the war was declared, and the Turkish troops in Basrah increased in number and the fighting was hot, they (i.e., the Turks) began to put pressure on me to collect tribes to fight with you, and they pressed me to do things which I could not do against your Government. They even compelled me to sign telegrams written by the Commandant of troops at Qishla, and he insisted on my signing them to (the address of) the people of Bahriyah and Ziyadiyah, which I could not possibly refuse. In the circumstances I found the best course was to go out of Basrah in order to save myself from their demands which did not suit my ways and view which have been in your favour from of old. I discussed this matter with Shaikh Khazal Khan, who also considered it {i.e., departure from Basrah) advisable, for the reason that if I had acted against the wishes of the Turks and dealt openly with you, my life and the lives of my children and of my family, and my property, all of them would have been in great danger and they would have killed me as they were in a strong position. I5 therefore secured an order from the Inspector of the war affairs stating the necessity of calling out Bin Saud to fight with you. This order was dated 20 days before the time {i.e, before the order was given?), and was the means of my getting out of Basrah in such a manner that nobody could prevent me. This was before the receipt of your letter to me through Shaikh Khazal Khan. I left Basrah after having secretly warned the President of the Municipal Committee, some of the townpeople and the Shaikh of Madinah, Hamud al Mir Jabir, not to fight with you. I then came to Koweit ex pressly to see the Consul and to complete my communications (negotiations) with you. I had no other business at Koweit. The said Consul informed * Misunderstanding. I did not say I had rne that you had sent me a letter* through wntten - p z Cox Shaikh Khazal Khan which I have not seen to this moment. He pressed me to stop at Koweit or to go to you to the battlefield. I explained to him my inability to do either, and let it not be hidden from you that if I had stayed on at Koweit or had come to you then, the Turkish Government with the hatred it had for me, would at once on hearing the news, have killed my children and my family and looted my property, which is one of the greatest calamities and tyrannies, and is recognised as such by you and others. After thus explaining to him my excuse and these dangers, I gave him my word of honour that I shall never act against you, that I shall serve your interests now and in future, in whatever way I can, and I will save my children and my family and my property (then in the hands of the Turks) from their mischief. I assured that my visit to Amir Abdul Aziz Pasha al Saud was not with the purpose, as is supposed among the Turks, of bringing him out to fight with you or to oppose you but to escape from the machinations of the Turks and to get the said Amir to intercede for me to you, as I knew all about him and his good relations with your Government and his real mind and intentions. For this reason I left Koweit and came to the said Amir. The letter which the Amir has written to Captain Shakespear, in w T hich he has explained to the latter that n.y views and intentions are in your favour and in no degree against you, will demon strate the fact that I do not ask him (&amp;.&lt;?., Bin Saud) to do anything against you. All the statements I have made to you and my action from the beginning to the end, are borne out by the references and communications I have made to your Government and by my good dealings with the subjects of your high Government and with the Christian Community at Basrah. All this is not hidden from the Christian Missionaries at Basrah, and the former British Consul at Basrah, Mr. Crow, was aware of it. The very fact that I have never displayed any activity against you, either before or after the war, and the treatment meted out to me by the Turks, these (in themselves) are great arguments proving that I support your views and desire to be with you in soul and body. I am now sending you the bearer of this letter, Haji Sulaiman Faizi, formerly a Basrah deputy, to represent me and inform you of what is necessary. He has been authorised by me to do all that is required, and any undertaking that he may give you in my behalf will be acceptable to me and will be adhered to by me. I therefore request you kindly to take him into your con fidence and admit him to a conversation with you, and also to give him a reply which will assure me of my reception and which will be suitable to the dignity of your high Government and your undoubted good disposition. I undertake to you to serve your good Government and endeavour to secure its interests in every way, now r and in future t Literally, one who should be shunned. because there will not now remain any tyrantf whom I shall fear.

It readied me at Muhammerah from the hand of onr friend Shaikh Khazal. Your honour wrote regarding Saiyid Talib and truly in you he has a sincere friend. I have understood and appreciated all you say and have also received a visit from Sulaiman Faizi who has given me further explanations. There is little more that I can say regarding Saiyyid 1 alib beyond what I have already written in my last letter,. especially as by now you must have Captain Shakespear with you and he will no doubt write to me lully. Apart from that also, if it becomes possible, I look forward to having a meeting with your honour personally, and at that time Saiyyid Talib would be able to speak to me fully about his affairs and his future, and I hope m the result we may come to such a satisfactory understanding as will enable me to make favourable representations to Government.

After compliments and enquiries after your health. —We have received your august communication dated the 14th Ehil Hijjah 1332 (3rd November7 m 1914), in which you state that your honour has already mentioned in your previous letter that the exalted Government of Great Britain has declared war against the Ottoman Government and that you have been ordered by the illustrious Government to invite us to co-operate with the Sheikh of Muhammerah and the Buler of Koweit—our cordial friends and sincere allies—and attack Basrah and liberate it from the Ottoman Government, or come to Basrah and prevent any re-inforcements reaching it or Qurnah, until the British troops arrive to seize the place ; and you mention the liberation of Basrah and its severance from the Turkish dominions, which is one of our chief objects, in this connection, and asks us to prevent plundering of goods belonging to the British merchants in the town of Basrah and its neighbour hood and to protect them from damages and turn out the Turkish troops from Al Hasa and Qatif and banish them from our town. The co-operation with the above-mentioned two friends is incumbent on us (and so it is for us to) use our good offices with our friends, the illustrious Government, in all useful actions which may be required by her. And I am using my endeavours and efforts in furthering the common interests of all friends. You should rest fully assured and be confident in this question. I am one of the greatest helpers to the Government of Great Britain and she will, God willing, obtain satisfactory results as we have mentioned to our mutual friend, Captain Shakespear. As to the Ottoman soldiers, we did not allow a single one of them to remain (in these parts) after our occupation and have turned them all out. But as to the following three matters by you, namely, the promise of the exalted Government to protect and safeguard us against the. Ottoman Government by affording us her assistance and her future protection (to us) against any attack and hostility which may be made by sea^ her recognition of the independence of my chiefship on all the parts of Nejd, Al Hasa and Qatif, and the conclusion of treaties between us will depend on our arrival at Koweit. I am leaving my headquarters on this date and am bound for Koweit and we will make the necessary verbal negotiations in order that we mav earn the approval of our friend, the Government of Great Britain. I hope you will continue to entertain sincere friendliness by delighting. my mind with the news of your welfare and of the conditions of the British Government. This is what was to be stated and may you ever be successful. 7 Telegram P., No. D.S.-96, dated the 26th January 1915.

As regards a present (of) money, I do not think he would expect it from us as an inducement nor do I like the idea of offering it as such.

Amongst other reasons, she came to Mohammerah and remains there in consequence of an earnest request made by Sirdar Arfa, Governor of Moham merah, whose action was promoted by the threatening attitude of the Turks, who, apart from other measures, stationed guns and men on island opposite to the mouth of the Karun river.

Knox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. I have the honour to forward herewith, for information, the translation of a note prepared by the informer Muhammad Amin and left with His Highness the Sultan, who handed it to the Political Agent, Maskat, on latter’s asking for it. The Political Agent reports that His Highness seemed very anxious to know what Muhammad Amin might say to me at Bushire. As a matter of fact, Muhammad Amin hardlv mentioned His Highness to me, except to say that the fact that he had been sent for through His Highness the Sultan by the Political Agent (this was in accordance with my instructions) had gone far to destroy His Highness’s conlidence in Muhammad Amin and, therefore, grieviously injured the latter. He added “ How could a man dke the Sultan bo conversant with State allairs and political secicts ?2 Translation of an Arabic letter. Durin' my stay at Basrah and association with one of the prominent men there I got acquainted with certain political matters winch I state tor vour consideration (or information). ■ It is not unknown to politicians that the Ottoman peoples split up into two parties after securing constitutional government. One of the Parties is Ittihadi (Unionist) and the other and greater is Itilah ( . )■ Ittihadis (Unionists) are inclined to republic and the Itilatis ( • ) ti the maintenance of the Caliphate as every sane person clearly understands that the various elements of the Ottmuan peoples li^^'Ts e pee^1^ lu « maintenance of the Empire and the Caliphate . Ibis is especially true in re'o the Arab element and two-thirds of Anatolians, who are rigidly in favour of the maintenance of the Caliphate. The number of the republicans islhus much less than the Khalifatis (Royalists). To look to the Muslim element outside the Ottoman Empire, there are about 550 millions of men in Asia who desire the maintenance of the Caliphate and, therefore, supposing that the Ottomans were stripped of the halo of the Caliphate, the Mus ims would naturally create (illegible) another Caliph and would rally to h.s standard hut this would be attended with harm at the present time. For instance, at the time of the Caliphate of Ali bin Talib (The fourth successor of the Holy Prophet) the Muslims were all of one common belief (faith) and there was no seism whatever. After Ali, the Muslim peoples split up into various sects, each of the sects zealously following the views of its own founder, i’hus, some followed the then Caliph, while others oppose him, the various sects setting up their own Imams. Of these the greatest sect was the Shia, who adored Ah bin T-ilib, and millions of them opposed the (next) Caliph and formed a distinct hodv. 5 In those old times, ignorance and fanaticism were greater than what they are to-day and the founders of religious sects took advantage of the ignor ance of the peoples. Although ignorance still exists yet in comparison to f miner times there is now much more general enlightenment. During these three years past, many men have been trying to secure the title of Khalifak for their names. They are (1) The Khedive Abbas Pasha of Egypt, (2) Husain Pasha, the Sharif of Mecca, (3) Saiyid Talib Bey, the Naqib of Basrah, (4) Imam Yahya of Sanna’a, Yemen, (5) Idris ?, Yemen, (6) Bin Sand of JN T ajd. With the exception of Saiyid Talib none of these aspirants has any serious hold on the minds of those concerned. Saiyid Talib is a native of Basrah which town is in the neighbourhood of Persia, and the majority of the Persians, being Shias, love Ali and his descendants, of whom Saiyid Talib is one, as he is descended from Hasan son of Ali. Some of the most prominent men in Persia have promised to accept his Baia't (allegiance) in case occasion should arise for so doing. Secondly, the (Muslim) Indians and all the (Muslim) inhabitants of Asia have an undescribabie regard for the Niqabab (office of Naqib). This statement is borne out by the fact that numbers of Zuwwar (pilgrims) mostly Indians and Bohras preferably go through Baghdad for no other purpose except for visiting the (shrines of the) ancestors of Saiyid Talib, who, too, has made a long tour in India in recent years with the object of enlisting support for his candidacy for this title or designation. At that time he was enabled to arrange that in the event of the Ottomans persisting in their efforts to do away with the Caliphate and establishing a republic, the people (Muslims of India) should certainly accept his Baiat (allegiance) as Khalifah. But there cannot he two Khalifahs at a time on the earth nor in one illegible (country), for Bin Sand is a rival claimant for this (honour) and this fact became clear to Saiyid Talib, who understood that he could not free himself from Ihe rivalry of Bin Sand, and so bethought himself to try and get some otuer distinction. Tims, taking advantage of the Government’s engagement in the Balkan war, he secretly negotiated with Bin Sand, and, after securing the reins of the (Turkish) garrison and the authorities by bribery, induced Bin Sand to take possession ot Najd and A1 Hisa together with the surroundings and properties and stores there without a stroke or opposition (on the part of the garrison).3 At the same time, in order to safeguard himself against (the action of) the Turkish Government, Saiyid Talib adopted a device in respect of Shaikh Mubarak-as-Subah of Kuwait and Sirdar Khazal Khan (of Muhammerah) .ivino- it out to the Government that being his neighbours these two Shaikhs ^ere ready to help him, if Government so desires, by men and money in re taking Al Hasa and that this had been definitely agreed upon between them. It was on this account that, as an act of friendship, Saiyid Talib endeavoured to secure for these two Shaikhs the distinction of the hirst Class Order of Mejidi and virtually succeeded therein. The appointment of Sulaiman ? Pasha as Wali and Commander nf troons at Basrah was due to the problem of Najd and the insurrection of ttin Sand as well as to the actions of Saiyid Talib Bey. This appointment was made at a time when the Central Government had many important problems w ith and the Wali was entrusted with secret instructions and was to have a free hand in all matters. As a matter of precaution, he was escorted by , sufficient force. Before the Wall’s arrival at Basrah, Saryid Talib ordered the local house-proprietors not to let a single house on rent to the Wall wrthm r, L vn o{ Basrah.

Every day that uoveis* Division consists of hundred and tenth, hundred and eleventh and the hundred and ninth Infantry Regiments with battalions numbering twelve hundred strong. Thirty-first Cavalry of seven hundred men, five thousand engineers train and followers mostly unarmed. Twenty-four field or mountain guns. Russian authority only gives two battalions per regiment but Consul at Baghdad gives four. Of the above it is reported that three to six thousand have deserted at Mosul and the condition of the remainder is most deplorable as only one-sixth are trained. The following troops are at Baghdad itself:—Thirteenth model battalion, deficit of arms (?), hundred and fourteenth Infantry Regiment of the Basrah Division numbering five hundred strong, fourteen guns of thirty-seventh Artillery and about nine thousand reservists of whom four thousand have not as yet received rifles. Seven mountain guns which are probably additional to these batteries mentioned in my telegram No. 999 and may include quick-firing pieces have been sent down to Basrah. It is also stated by the Consul at Baghdad that he believes that both the Kerkuk and Mosul Divisions have gone to West. As in case of Baghdad Division, the Consul at Baghdad gives Mosul Resriments at four battalions but from reports received # from Aleppo, Regiments consisting of only two battalions appear to have arrived at Baghdad. The report from Aleppo is probably correct. As regards numbers of men, there is no doubt that there are third battalions in existence but before they can be incorporated with others they require to be trained. The so-called fourth battalions are merely masses of men at depots. The same remarks apply to the thirty-seventh Division at Baghdad.

The situation which has been revealed by the recent telegrams has, it seems, caused some local anxiety and the strain on the troops is greatly increased on account of the establishment of look-out posts and the incessant way in which the pickets are harassed by night. The Officer Commanding the troops in the Persian Gulf, who has been consulted by me, states that in the event of attack on Maskat relief cannot ordinarily he expected from Bait- al-Falaj. The situation is perfectly quiet at Bushire and, with the Expedi tionary Force at Bahrein, it is not likely that we shall have trouble here. It is, therefore, proposed by the Officer Commanding that his headquarters should be transferred to Maskat with a detachment of 100 men, who sail by the mail of the 30th October, unless orders are received to the contrary, and will arrive at Maskat just before the Id festival, when the Sultan expects trouble there. The situation will also he improved if the “ Ocean ” were to coal at Maskat. I strongly recommend this step if it is practicable.

However, we are to meet again next week. The Dir Saheb told me that the war has caused great economic difficulty in Arabia, and that their trade is at a complete standstill and he expressed a sincere hope that peace would be declared at the earliest possible moment. He also expressed his satisfaction that the panic in Bombay had been confined to certain classes of Hindus, and that so far the Muhammadans were standing firm. He pur chased samples of the tilings which the children of the Musalman Girls Orphanage are making for Indian soldiers at the front, and made a donation of Rs. 200 to our Orphanage Funds. ^ Telegram P., dated (and received) the 30th October 1914.

I have had ati interesting interview with my News Agent at Hodeida. He thinks that the objective of the Turks, it they declare war,4 I will be the recovery of Kars and Batoum, though the concentration of their troops at A1 Akaba is probably intended for operations (?) against Egypt. A wholesome dread of our naval power is entertained by the Turks at Hodeida who have transferred their military stores and arsenal to Bajil in the hills. According to the News Agent, Turkey will be forced to declare war against Great Britain. He thinks that Idrisi is not likely to come to terms with the Turks, who however, fear his occult powers. As regards Imam, he says that Mahmud Nadim, Governor-General of Yemen, is the only one whose policv saves a rupture between Imam and the Turks. Eurther, Turkish subjects, firstly, Zaranik, whose port is A1 Taif, and secondly, Al Hakam, at Khokandi, are thorns in the side of the Turks. * ’ (End of new r s obtained from Agent.)

In a private letter from the Sultan of Lahej to his friend the Imam, the latter has been informed of the Sanction accorded by the Government of India to his request for the services of a man to give instructions in the manufacture of gunpowder, since it was through the Sultan that the Imam’s wish was originally communicated to the Government of India. The Sultan has also addressed a letter to the Imam with a view to sounding him as to his standing and feelings towards us.

War has broken out between Great Britain and Turkey, but it is notified, for the public information of all the Moslems, that, so long as the Indian pilgrims proceeding to Mecca and Medina, are not seriously interfered with, no hostile action will be taken by the British, or Indian, Government or by their ships or soldiers against the port of Jeddah or the Holy Places. By order of the High British Government, Major, Ojfg. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Very confidential. COMMUNIQUE OF BRITISH CASE AGAINST TURKEY. The attitude, adopted by the Turkish Government in regard to the German warships “ Goeben ” and “ Breslau ”, has aroused great misgivings m ^ &gt;ar ^ s and Petrograd. These ships were flying from French and British men-of-war in the Mediterranean and took refuge in the Dardanel- les, where, by the rules of International Law and under Turkish Treaties, they should have been laid up by the Turkish Government and their crews repat riated until the close of the war, or made to leave for the open sea at the end or twenty-four hours. nstead of this, the ships were allowed to remain in shelter and to exercise e hgerent rights on a Trench ship, and then it was announced that they had een puichased by Turkey, who retained the German crews and dismissed the British Admiral from his executive command of the Turkish fleet. At the same time the passage of the Dardanelles was sown with mines, and all British vessels in those waters or coming through from the Black Sea W i! re ,. e pretext that their cargoes w r ere wanted for troops W 'T as liao ^^ dz big, and then, that the presence of mines rendered it unsafe for vessels to proceed. This was not only a totally unjustifiable interfer ence on t le part of a neutral State with the trade of Great Britain involved both shippers and merchants in heavy loss, but it paralysed movement of all British shipping in the Black Sea, amounting at the time to 60 or 70 vessels,* A' since not only was it impossible to get through into the Mediterranean, but there was nothing to prevent the “ Goeben ” and “ Breslau” passing into the Black Sea and destroying all the ships collected there. While the wireless telegraphy installations of Prench and British ships were dismantled by orders of the Turkish Government, a German merchant vessel, the “ Lily Rickmers ”, was allowed to retain and use her apparatus and was afterwards transferred to the Turkish flag, a proceeding which the Turkish Government themselves admit to be wholly illegal. Another reason of grave disquietude has been unfriendly treatment by responsible Turkish officials in Baghdad and Mesopotamia of British subjects and the open incitement of the population by Turkish official circles against Great Britain and her allies. Notwithstanding all this provocation, His Majesty’s Government have not only intimated that, if Turkish are substituted for German crews on the “ Goehen ” and “ Breslau ” and if British merchant ships are not impeded and if Turkey will honourably carry out the duties of a neutral State, not only would all these hostile acts and illegalities be overlooked but that a solemn and written guarantee would be given that Great Britain will scrupulously respect and safeguard the integrity of the Turkish Empire: furthermore, assurances w r ere odven that, at conclusion of peace, Great Britain would see that no conditions were laid down, which would impair that independence and integrity, and that economic conditions of a character favourable to Turkey would be obtained. Great Britain, the greatest Muhammadan Power in the world and the faithful and consistent friend of Turkey, whom she has steadfastly helped to maintain her position in Europe and to recover the stability, shaken in the Balkan wars, would see with the greatest regret that Turkey had been decoyed into ranging herself on the side of England’s enemies and adopting an attitude as uniustified as it would be ungrateful, but it cannot be denied that the present situation shows that there is a chauvinistic element endeavouring to drive Turkey into war with England for the benefit of Germany and ot Austria, the secular enemy of the Turkish State.

Latter consisted of a daughter and Ismail Bey his son now in Sultan’s service at Maskat. Sultan formed a great friendship with the son and subsequently made proposals with a view to marrying the daughter. His Highness has kept up correspondence with the family e\er since their return to Constantinople, mainly in connection with his matrimonial proposal. His Highness invited Ismail to Maskat after the death of the late Sultan and through him has continued to press his suit. ^ ^ saving been received, the message quoted in vour telegram of the 16th September was sent by Ismail in French. Sultan naturally was un willing to allow his intentions to become public owing to an uncertainty as to the acceptance of his proposal. Personally, 1. feel convinced that in neither of the intercepted telegrams is there any disguised signification. His Highness went so far as to show me photographs of the lady taken in Constantinople and correspondence signed by Fuad rtcy in proof of the sincerity of his explanation. .

While we were astonished at the report received in our town of Dibai “V from India regarding the hostility between the European Powers, we received an intimation from your Agent, Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif, that war has broken out between Great Britain and Germany, and subsequently, we received your letter, dated the 2‘2nd Ramazan (15th August) intimating that a state of war exists between Great Britain and Austria and also your communication of the 15th Ramazan (8th August 1914) announcing that war has occurred between Great Britain and Germany. Both ourselves and the inhabitants of our town have been disturbed by this serious catastrophe, which has proved a universal calamity and which has disturbed peace in every respect and ruined commerce. This catastrophe is a misfortune, the occurrence of which did not cross any one’s mind ; but there is no help for it (literally, “we say what is said* by those who are patient, viz., ‘ verily we are from God and verily to Him shall we return’”). In order to evince our well-wishes and sense of honour and to return thanks for the good (done to us), it is incumbent upon us to assist the exalted and Imperial British Government, as it has always ensured Comfort for us, and our town, enterprise and business which has gained us our livelihood. We have undoubtedly considered onrselves to be under many obligations to it in every respect and we have not repaid it in any way as we are not in a position to do so owing to our inability, which is not hidden from it. In this catas trophe, whose parallel we have not heard since the times of our forefathers and ancestors, we have been meditating most anxiously to get an opportunity of doing such good services as may gain us merit in its august presence ; but we find ourselves unable in every way. How ever, we pray to God, the Most High, to help it and to grant it victory over its enemies w T ho are opposing it with aggression. By the grace of God, it will be the aggressor who will suffer a downfall. Please never discontinue from us the news of your well-being and your good reports. This is what had to be stated and may you remain preserved. Greetings. 75* . Telegram P., No. 1148, dated the 26th (received 27th) September 1914.

I would propose to send following answer to acting consul at Basra : “ You should give Talib friendly but evasive answer. You may say His Majesty’s Government have no designs against Turkey, and have been indelatigably patient under much provocation, not because they have any reason to fear immediate issue ot war, but because they are, on one hand, sincerely friendly to lurkey, and, on the ot iei hand regard maintenance of Turkish integrity in Asia as a British interest. I he) ha\ e consequently preferred to wait until Turkey can emancipate herself from her present evil o-enius i.e., Germany. They have every sympathy with Arabs, but they consider now, as Tn the past, that interests of Arabs of Mesopotamia will be best secured by their forming an integral element of Turkish Empire under a tolerant and intelligent central Government. f You may remind Talib that all his own recent conduct has shown that he shares this conviction. His message will be conveyed to Lord Kitchener, but if he is going back on his reconciliation with Turkey under the impression that war is inevitable he is making a mistake. War is only inevitable if Turks insist on precipitating it, and H s Majesty’s Government are still unwilling to believe that lurkey will allow herse to be jockeyed by Germany into so gigantic a folly. '^mayleed to use Talib if things actually come to a head with' Turkey, hut he has been too much in both camps to justify any confidence in him. , . , You may vary details of above message in any way which seems to you advisable with a view to not estranging him, but you should not depart from mam line of it. at would be interesting to know whether Talib and his friends are prepared with any Concrete policy' andGhat are his present relations with men like the Sheikh of Xoweit and Bin Saud.

The Government of India ask for the opinion of the Bombay Government as to the treatment now to be accorded to Sheikh Salim-al-Khayyurn in view of the fresh informa tion received from Sir p. Cox. 2. It is as well to bear in mind the original statement made by Sir P. Cox in his telegram dated January 13 from Basrah to the Foreign Office, Delhi. That statement was as follows ;- 'He (Salim Khayyam Sheikh) held rank of Captain under Turkish regime and received salary of £ 80/- per mensem as Commander of local river guards on that section of the Euphrates. He is well known as a clever intriguer and firebrand and since our occupation of Gurnah he has been active in endeavour ing in association with others to excite tribemen under his influence on that side to give us trouble. ***** This man is not a crimin al and I think might be allowed to live at large in Bombay or Poona subject to police supervision. He would need an allowance of about Rs.250/- a month *■**•*• He would be allowed to return under suitable guarantee at end of war or when firm establishment of our administration admits of it'. 3. The main points in this telegraphic statement are ;- (a) Salim was dangerous, because he was true to his co-religionists and employers, the Turks. (b) Salim was not a criminal (c) Salim was some day to return to his own people and his home. 4. Taking these three facts contained in Sir Percy Cox’s original report as the basis of our regiment, what do these most recent papers show ? 5* in regard to (a) they simply prove what we have alreadyalready inferred,-namely that Salim was stubbornly loyal to Turkey to the last, even in spite of the fact that he was accused of cowardice by Javid Pasha. Is it just or reasonable go enhance on these grounds the punishment which ae is already undergoing and to surround his exile with more drastic restrictions ? I think not. We knew .i.ii vanuary tnat Salim had faithfully served his employers tne Turks, and that from our standpoint this necessitated uis arrest and exile. The new papers merely give further details of his collusion‘(before arrest) with the Power vdiose salt he was eating and whose religion was his own, I M0 They make no difference to the main fact, which \e 'knew before, that Salim’s loyalty to his employers rendered him a thorn in our side and made his removal from Irak an imperative necessity from the British point of view. That being so, why should we now render more irksome the exile to a strange city which has been noted out to him ? Sir p. Cox’s object via.., his removal from the sphere of his power and activities, has been achieved; and this being so, surely it is unnecessary to go further and crush altogether a man who, junglebred and comparatively ignorant of the world outside the limits of his own desert, ^ did his best to serve loyalty the country which employed him and to which he was bound by the ties of a common Faith. The telegram to Salim from Ismail Haqqi shows clearly that the Turks wished the former to believe that Islam was in danger and seeing how powerful an incite ment to action such an appeal must be to a Musalman of the type of Salim, one can scarcely blame him if in his ignorance of what British rule means he decided to assist his co-religionists to the best of his ability. As regards point (a) therefore I do not think we should make any alteration in our present treatment of Salim. 6. In regard to (b) we must presumably accept the theory that Salim instigated the murder of BandarKhayyum* But here it may be pointed out that his com plicity has not been prov ed according to the rules of European justice, that he has not been given any chance to defend himself against the charge, and that therefore it is difficult for persons accustomed to British law and practice to assent to the punishment of an accused merely on moral conviction or suspicion. Secondly it seems hardly fair, even in this matter of assassination, to judge Salim by our standards. Salim knew that Bandar would not resist the British occupation of the Euphrates Valley; Salim is a staunch Moslem; Salim saw in Bandar a man who was likely to assist those whom he had been wrongly taught to regard as the enemies of Islam and who was likely to prove false to the Government whom he served. He may reasonably have considered it a religious duty to rid the country of such a man; lor Salim is still mediaeval in his knowledge and outlook and his instigation of this murder if indeed he did instigate io finds ito parallel in somewhat similar deeds slironpcled in t»ne earlier history of European countries. On the one side there.'oce we have the moral conviction of the Persian Gulf Authorities that Salim instigated this murder, proof, according to our standards, is presumably not forthcoming and Salim, accused In his absence, has not been able to answer the charge. On the other hand we have the spectacle of a backward ana comparatively v,ild and untutored Arab, urged by loyalty to his employers and incited by religious fanaticism, whicn is the mos^ powerful incitement of all, to remove a man who oo tie best of his belief was likely to betray tne cause -or which he was fighting. Can we in these circumstances mete out to Salirn such punishment as we might mete out to a common felon convicted by a. High Court in British India ? I venture to think we cannot. 7. As regards the third point (c) are we to assume thatthat Sir P. Cox’s original intention to restore Salim even tually to his trihe and country still holds good ? If he is too influential a man to he brushed aside and broken, and if he is to return hereafter to his own people, then I say most emphatically that it would be a blunder to take at this stage any action which would tend to xsntexx render nugatory our attempts to turn him into an Anglo phile. I have every reason to believe that our efforts up to date have not been in vain. Salim is softening day by day, and in regard to the attitude of our administratioi towards Moslem 'his eyes', as he himself remarked 'have been opened*. His history, as revealed in Sir P. Cox’s report, shows him to be a man worth winning over; and for this reason I would greatly prefer to confront him with the shiwld of kindness rather than with the sword of tribulation. And if we pjpQsevere on the lines we have hitherto adopted he may in time become as good a friend as he was, before his deportation, implacable and consistent an enemy* 3. The net result of ray argument is therefore that Salirr should be left where % he is and that we should continue to treat him as we have hitherto done. He cannot in any way interfere with Sir p. Cox’s policy or action, for he is in exile and under surveillance, while the treatment accorded to him and the daily proof which he receives of the tranquillity and sympathy of our administration may ultimately ensure bot^his attachment to us and in himself the awakening of a keener perception of the value of human life.(Confidential) e From No, gS^-- f.

MEMORANDUM REGARDING CASE OF SALIM KHAYYOOM. nf 1 ™ ? ha! . kh of 1,16 Beni Saad tribe headquarters at the village of Chubaish on the river Euphrates about 30 miles above Gurnah. Before the war began Shaikh Salim had a past record and bad reputation as a firebrand and clever intriguer, from the Arab point of view. His past history however, has no connection with the present case. t y&gt; At the time the war began, like most of the Shaikhs on the Shatt-el-Arab Tieris and Euphrates on this side of Amara, and Suk-es-Shuyukh, Salim was bv wav of co-operating with the Turks by mobilising a contingent of his dependants^ and bringing them down to assist in driving back the advancing British Troops, oahm s force, however, arrived too late to be present. After our capture of Basrah and Gurnah the local Shaikhs for a considerable distance up the Tigris and Euphrates, including, on the Euphrates line, those of Shirnsh Beni Mansur a nd Medina, who had been actually fighting against us iri the bhatt-eNArab, wrote in or sent in representatives to me as Chief 3 Political Officer, to express their desire to submit themselves to the British Government and to enter into friendly relations, and to ask permission to come in to interview me for the purpose. All such were all given conciliatory replies, came in to see me and have been on satisfactory terms with us ever since. Sahm Khayyoom, however, wrote first excusing himself from coming in on the score of indisposition, which was not bond fide, and later, on the ground that he had certain stipulations to make (most extravagant ones) and wanting to know before meeting whether he might expect them to be granted. He went on trifl ing, with me through other parties for some weeks, intermittently, but all the time he \vas co-operating actively with the Turks, and endeavouring to a e t the Arabs in his neighbourhood to join them. . . Fln ally, he having neglected the specific opportunities afforded him and the advice given him by mutual friends such as the Shaikh of Muhammareh. and it being certain that so long as he was on the Euphrates unrest would prevail there I was authorized to effect his arrest and this was done on 7th January fEnclo- sure V.) • / j j \ On arrest Salim was brought down to Basrah and placed on a Transport waiung to proceed to Bombay. His young brother followed him down and staved with friends in Basrah as long as the Transport was in pore. He probably did not get on board the Transport but it is known that he had communication with ms brother while on the ship. Sahm had several brothers or half-brothers and it was hoped that one of t &lt;em, named, Bandar khayyoom, who had the reputation of being a well disposed man wuh good influence in the tribe, would succeed to the Chiefship of the Beni oaad at Chuoaish. Sahm left for Bombay on 13th January. On 31st, the Political Officer at ‘ urnah telegraphed that Shaikh Bandar had been murdered by his brother Ali assisted by some of Sahm s Shabaneh employes. ,, 0n ‘'; e 9 ‘ h February, ihe Political Officer, Gurnah, visited Chubaish to instal the new Shaikh, Majid, who had been chosen by„the tribesmen, and to enquire c »'“ '\into Bandar’s murder. According to his local enquiries the murder had been instigated by Salim and in reporting on loth February the Political Officer wrote to the following effect—: I think we should take notice of Bandar’s murder. Saleh-el-Hajjaj is 1 Salim’s friend and agent in Basrah and 1 understand it was through him that Salim sent orders for Bandar’s murder. “Saleh-el-Hajjaj has also been mentioned to me as one of the most active of the Basrah agitators against the British Government. ” Shortly afterwards Salim’s complicity received corroboration from a passage in his letter to Saleh-el-Hajjaj of which a translation was received with the letter marginally cited. Government of Bombay, Political Department || k The passage runs :— letter, No. 798-W of 28th January 1915, received February 13th under cover of Foreign Depart- “J have alreadv instructed Yunis and AH ment letter No. 217.W of4th Febiuarj 19,5. when [ was at Basrah that they should not make delay in the matters (about which) I spoke to them/’ These instructions were not improbably those for the murder of Bandar, for which Salim had an obvious motive. At this same visit to Chubaish, the Turkish telegraph office there connected with Nasiriyeh and Baghdad via Euphrates Valley which was still working, under Salim’s regime, was raided and papers seized. A number of original telegrams of recent date were found, showing that Salim was in communication with Constantinople and Commander-in-Chief of Turkish Forces in Iraq, up to within a short time of his arrest. I attach trans lations of some of them. I. Copy of a translation of a telegram from Ismail Haqqi, Acting Minister of War.Stamboul, to Salim Khayyoom Bey, dated 26th November 1770 . or December 1914. “ When I received your telegram, showing that you will join us to defend and save the Iraq, I was very grateful, and I thank you for your zeal and reli gious enthusiasm. “ You should communicate with Javid Pasha and join him, and do your best to drive out the kaffirs from the lands of Islam and to destroy them. “All Muhammadans of Africa, Egypt, Hejaz, Syria and surrounding countries are helping the cause of Islam in every way. For the Khalif of Islam has proclaimed a holy war, and wishes to protect the religion and territories of the Muhammadans. In the name of Allah l will crush all such ignorant tribes who are helping the British. ^ s “ 1 sha11 be coming with a great force in your direction.
