The bottom of each the next seven columns is damaged with some text missing. There are several minor lacunae elsewhere in the papyrus. The text begins with a sequence of spells that deal with the treatment of a woman suffering from a range of disorders related to pregnancy, still birth, and infertility.  At column 6, line 15, there begins a book of dispelling terrors and fears (of the night) from children, including one spell for dispelling crying and tears (beginning at column 7, line 17). The texts of this papyrus have no real parallels known from published material, for the most part.  There are several hundred additional fragments, both small and of moderate size that still need to be placed; most of them belong to the damaged beginning of the papyrus.", "medium": "Papyrus, ink", "dimensions": "a: Small Box of Fragments: 1 3/4 x 4 1/16 x 4 1/16 in.
