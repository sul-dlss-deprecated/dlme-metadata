Countless variations have been preserved, differing in design, size, and material, but always associated with eternity and regeneration. \r\n\r\nThis scarab has a very special bottom design displaying the king as a bull trampling over a prone enemy, with the script sign of a hoe in front of the bull's head. A Horus hawk wearing the double-crown (of Upper and Lower Egypt) is displayed in front of the bull, and the cartouche with the throne-name of the king is above his back. Such an amulet should secure the divine, victorious power of the king, as well as royal authority. It provides its owner with royal patronage and protection.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1929", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/17078", "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore [date and mode of acquisition unknown];  Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "18th Dynasty", "Reign": "Thutmose III", "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2009-09-11T09:35:05.56", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.76_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.76_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.76_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.76_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.76_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "2172", "Images": "CUR_42.76_Back_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.76_Bot_DD_design_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.76_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.76_Rt_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.76_VwA_DD_hieroglyphictext_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.76_VwA_DD_TranscriptionRS2009.jpg, CUR_42.76_VwB_DD_hieroglyphictext_RS2009.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
