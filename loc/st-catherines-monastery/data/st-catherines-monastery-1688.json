Sinai was constructed by the Byzantine Emperor, Justinian I, in the late  sixth century AD over the relics of the martyred saint and the place of the  biblical burning bush as identified by St. Helena, the mother of the Roman  Emperor, Constantine.  It is home to  reputedly the oldest continuously run library in existence today. Its holdings  of religious and secular manuscripts are legendary and allegedly second only in  number to the collection held by the Vatican: from bibles, to patristic works,  to liturgies and prayers books, and on to legal documents such as deeds, court  cases, <em>Fatwahs</em> (legal opinions).  The  greater proportion of the manuscripts were copied in Greek, and then in Syriac,  Georgian, Coptic, Armenian, Arabic, Ottoman Turkish, and Ethiopic, as well as  Old Church Slavonic.</p>  <p> In 1949, Kenneth W. Clark, led an expedition to the Middle  East under the Auspices of the Library of Congress and its partners, to microfilm  old manuscripts in various libraries of the Middle East, the largest and most  isolated of which was that at St. Catherine&rsquo;s. His group evaluated the 3,300  manuscripts held there and chose 1,687 for filming.  Finally, the group also prepared under his  direction a <em><a href=\"http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=gdc3&fileName=scd0001_20120109002chpage.db\">Checklist of Manuscripts in St. Catherine&rsquo;s Monastery, Mount  Sinai Microfilmed for the Library of Congress</a></em> (1950),  which gave researchers access to both the Manuscripts microfilms and the black  and white transparencies. The microfilm collection is in the custody of the  Humanities and Social Sciences Division, where it still may be requested. </p>  <p>Since its appearance, this set  has been so widely consulted by scholars around the globe that the Library has now  digitized the microfilms to facilitate their use by scholars worldwide. At the  same time the descriptions of the manuscripts as found in the <em>Checklist </em>have  also been edited and updated.</p>  <p>Clark&rsquo;s group also chose 1,284 illuminations from 113  manuscripts to be photographed in 4 x 5 inch black and white format. These have  been listed on pages 22-32 of the <em>Checklist</em>. These have not been digitized  at this time but are available to researchers in the <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/rr/print/\">Prints and Photographs  Division</a> of the Library of Congress. </p>  <p>Prints of the illuminations and microfilm reproductions of  the manuscripts may be requested through our <a href=\"//www.loc.gov/duplicationservices/\">Duplication Services.</a> When ordering a microfilm or print copy of a manuscript, provide the series number, then add the manuscript number.</p>  <p><u>Example</u>:  Syriac Manuscripts 89.
