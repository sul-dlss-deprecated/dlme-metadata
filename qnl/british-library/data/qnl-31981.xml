It will be seen from these that it is the normal practice in China and Japan for all foreign consulates to fly their flags daily; that the United States Government so far from taking exception to such a practice actually wishes to encourage it; and that in France although the flying of flags daily would be regarded as rather unusual, it is unlikely that any formal objection would be raised, in the absence of any definite regulations on the subject. 3. With this material the Government of India will be/ M. J. Clauson, Esq, REGO. POL.

Nurzad is not the object of discrimination. I do not, however, know whether the Government of India will wish after this lapse of time, to take the initiative in reopening this question.

The Q[uai d'Orsay inform us verbally that so far as they are aware there are no definite regulations on this subject in France but that the generally accepted rule is for foreign Consuls to fly their flags on their own national holidays, on French national holidays and on special occasions. It was unlikely, the Quai d^rsay added, that any formal objection would be raised if one of His Majesty’s Consulates in France took to flying the Consular flag daily. It would, however, be considered odd and if, for example, trouble occurred as the result of some hostile demonstration when a Consular flag was being flown on a day which was not a national holiday or a special occasion, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs would probably argue that it could not be held responsible since the general practice with regard to the flying of flags was not being observed.

Subsequently the Government of India, basing themselves on the principle of reciprocity, forbade the Persian Consulate-General and Consulates in India to fly their flags daily, as had previously been their custom, and informed them that they should only do so on national holidays and special occasions. 3. The Persian Consul-General, with the backing/ The Chancery, British Embassy, Peking* \ \ \ , V V% backing of his Government., has now protested against this action of the Government of India on the ground that no steps have been taken to prevent other Consulates in India from flying their flags daily (as most of them do, '(rvi^uU. aJr 6a£&amp;«, fcx aw/ ^ . including the Chinese Vice-Coiisul at Bombay J and that this arfeltfits^o^iscrimina/tion against Persia; and when it has been pointed out to him that in no other country than Persia are regulations limiting the flying of flags by Consulates in force, has asserted in renly that ne knows ic to oe a fact that all Consuls (and diplomatic Missions) in all countries are restricted to flying their flags on holidays only* 4.

Would you please therefore, if you see no objection, put the following question to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in whatever manner you think best: supposing for the sake of argument that one of His Majesty’s Consulates were to take to flying the Consulate flag daily, would your Government raise any obstacle or objection? 6. There is no objection to your explaining the reason for this enquiry, and it may in any case be desirable for you to make it clear: (a) that His Majesty’s Consulates have no desire to alter their existing practice as regards flag-flying; 03)/(b) that the Government of India have no desire to prevent the ChlMS* Vloo-Consulato or any other from flyirv 7 its flag'as much or as little as it chooses, provided they can feel assured that they are applying consistently the rule of reciprocity which they have invoked in the case of the Persian Consulates. 7.

In these circumstances I should have thought that our best line was to say to the Iranians 'At your request the British Legation and British Consulates in Iran agreed to cease flying their flags daily. Since that date Indian travellers to Iran have drawn unfavourable comparisons between what they regard as the restrictions imposed on British representatives in Iran and the Freedom enjoyed by Iranian representatives in India. In view of the representations made by Indians to the Government of India in the matter the latter accordingly decided to request Iranian Consular Officers in India to follow the practice observed by the British representatives 3n Iran. This request involves no discrimination against Iran since it is by no means the uniform practice for foreign Consuls in India to fly their flags daily. By agreeing to it, the Iranian representatives will in fact find themselves in no worse a position than that adopted voluntarily 'by* say, the French and the Dutch’ 1 . This is not quite what either you or the Foreign Office suggested but I put it forward for what it is worth for your consideration. As soon as anything is finally decided, I think it would be a good plan for us to repeat to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here whatever you tell Monsieur Nourzad.

From enquiries made from the local Governments it appears that the practice followed by various Foreign Consular representa tives in India with regard to the flying of their national flag is not uniform, e.g., (a) The Government of Bombay states that a majority of the Foreign Consulates in Bombay fly their flags every day. Others do so occasionally while some have no flag staff erected outside the Consulates. (b) The Government of Bengal states that the American and Japanese Consulates-General fly their flags daily, while the French Consulate General fly their flag on the 14th July 1936, which is a French national holiday. It does not appear that the other Consular Officers in Calcutta fly their flags every day.

On the question of principle, you probably know that we have never quite seen eye to eye with the Government of India. It has always seemed to us that considerations of reciprocity and of most favoured-nation treatment are both equally irrelevant, and that the Government of India are, in fact, discriminating against the Persian Consul General by their present action. Instructions issued by the Foreign Office for the flying of flags at Legations and Consulates abroad are domestic regulations/ M. J. Clauson, Esq. 2 Sr-r \N -J X r. /. j /V S3 7 9 ; U- 1936 fTregulations mainly designed to prevent the hoisting of the flag from ceasing to have any special significance, and our Legations and Consulates are expected to conform to the regulations in force in the country in which they are situated. Be this as it may, however, it is clearly too late for the Government of India to change their course, even if they should wish to do so and we are, moreover, rather inclined to sympathise with the action taken, on the ground that the Persians have Been tiresome about flag-flying in the past and that it will do them no harm to nurse this little grievance for a time. We are inclined to suggest then that, in the circumstances, the right to fly a flag all day and every day should only be restored to the Persian Consul General as a reward for good behaviour at some future date, by way of a 'friendly 'gesture'. In the meantime, the Government of India may care to put Nourzad wise about the general/general practice. We do not appear to have any information available here about the position in Japan and it is probably, therefore, quite normal. If the Government of India will furnish a list of Consulates, other than those of Japan and Afghanistan, who fly their flags daily, we can endeavour to find out whether foreign consuls wuo wisn to do so are, or would be, free to fly their flags daily in those countries. JLcXMinute Paper Mr. Wanton, St* Please see the Minute at P.Z.6916/35 and the papers at P.Z.633/36. Sir Aubrey Metcalfe now writes that the Persian Consul General at Delhi has re-opened the question. &gt; So far as I can see the Foreign Office circular, to which Sir Aubrey refers in para.3 of his letter, is applicable primarily to H.M.'s diplomatic representatives, whilst consular procedure in regard to flying flags is regulated by the General Consular Instructions of March 1921. Chapter 4 of these instructions specifies the occasions on which flags are to be flown, and then adds:- 'Consular Officers should also fly their flags at any time if they think it desirable, paying due regard to the practice followed by their foreign colleagues.' If our Consular Officers in countries which maintain Consuls in India have been allowed such liberty, it would seem that we should be able to refute the Persian Consul General T s present contentions.

Yours (Sgd.) M. J. CLAUSON*lilt) D.O.No.F.489-N/35. Simla; Is The Hit, June 1936. Will you please refer to correspondence ending with my demi-official letter No.F.4£9-r r /35, dated the 9th January 1936, on the subject of flying of flags by Iranian Consular officers in India. The Iranian Consul General has returned to the charge, and now states his case as follows. He says that it is unfair that the Iranian flag should be permitted to be flown only on holidays, while the flags of other Consuls General in Delhi and Simla are allowed to be flown on every day of the year- Cn its being pointed out to him that the flying of flags was not governed by the principle of most-favoured-nation treatment but by reciprocity, he replied that while fully admitting this he must point out that by international practice other Nations also had not the right to fly their flags except on holidays. In effect he argued that we ought not to enforce reciprocal restrictions against Iran only when wewe did not do it against other countries who maintain Consuls in India. 2* As far as we are aware, it is a fact that other Consuls, e.g., the Consuls General for Japan and Afghanistan, do fly their flags in Calcutta, Delhi and Simla^as the case may be,every day but we are making further enquiries on this point. It was suggested to M. Nourzad that the reason for this was probably that Japan, Afghanistan, and other countries imposed no restrictions on the flying of flags by British Consular officers in their countries. We know in fact that no restrictions are applied in Afghanistan and that flags are flown there every day (vide Humphrys' demi-official letter 555/1, dated 15th October ^ 1926 to the Foreign Office and tamer * s reply of 11th November 1926). His reply to this was that within his experience he knew that all diplomatic rissions and Consuls in all countries were restricted to flying their flags on holidays only, and that if we enforced reciprocity against Iran, we ought to enforce it against the consular establishmentsestablishments of other countries also. 3. We have examined the Foreign Office circular dated the 15th September 1926, which lays down regulations for the flying of flags by His Majesty's representatives and consular officers abroad. It appears by implication from this circular that flags are to be hoisted on special occasions only and not every day, and if this is so, the circular lends colour to the complaints of the Iranian Consul General. We should therefore be glad if you would obtain the advice of the Foreign Office as to the practice actually followed in this matter by His Majesty's Consular officers in the countries which maintain Consuls in India. Should it be found that restrictions on the flying of flags are in fact enforced against His Majesty's Consular representatives in those countries, do the Foreign OfficeOffice think that we ought to enforce reciprocal restrictions on the consuls of those countries in India? 4 .

X X X X In conclusion I enclose the note verhale promised hy Mr. Acheson dealing with the question of flying of flags in accordance with the principle of reciprocity. &lt; iMote Verbale The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India is directed to invite the attention of the consul General for Iran in India to the question of the procedure to he followed as regards the flying of flags at Consulates in Iran and India. The position is that prior to 1933 £b H.M's and other Consular officers in Iran used to fly their flag over their Consulate buildings every day and without any restriction. In that year the Iranian Ministry for Foreign Affairs made a request to H.M.’s Minister Tehran that H.M.’s Consular officers should fly their national flags only on vertical flagstaffs » affixed to the Consulate buildings and only on Sundays and on the occasion of Iranian and their own festivals and holidays and not every day. H.M.’s Minister at Tehran agreed to the request of the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and since then H.M.’s consular officers in Iran fly their flags onxy on the days specified above and not regularly. 2. The Government of India consider that on the principle of reciprocity of consular privileges it is desirable that similar restrictions be observed by the Consul General for Iran and other Iranian Consular ' ^ \ officers in India. 3. The Consul General for Iran is therefore reques ted kindly to issue instructions that with effect from 15th September 1935 the Iranian flag should be flown on the Iranian GonsulaiCGeneral and other Iranian Consulates and official residences in India only on Fridays and other....\ - 2 - other Iranian holidays (of which a list may kindly he sent to this Department) and on the occasion of Gazetted holidays of the Gcvemment of India (a list of which is enclosed), and not every day as at present. In any case in which the Iranian flag is at present flown from a flag staff set up in the grounds of the residence it is requested that it he transferred to a staff affixed to the building itself.

With reference to the conversation I had with you on the 13th instant regarding the question of flying flags over the building of this consulate General and otiler Iranian Consulates in India, I wish to point out that all other Foreign Consulates in this Country enjoy the privilege of flying their flags on px’actically all the days of the year iirespective of any particular holidays or other important occasions. This privilege, I believe, is accorded to them by the Government of India mainly on tho principle of reciprocity which governs the relations subsisting between them and the other Governments, and not because the latter are regarded by the former as 'Nation la plus favorisee'. The preferential treatment of one Government as against the other, especially in this cutter, appears to me as somewhat invidious, and opposed to the accepted principle of reciprocity, therefore, I desire that the same privi lege xft should also be accorded to Iran that is being enjoyed by the other Foreign Consulate-Generals in India. In conclusion, I would like to add that till such time as this question is finally and agreeably settled there should be no objection to our flying the flag over this Consulate-General and the other Iranian Consulates in India every day, as has been previously done.Copy of demi-official letter NO.F.489-N/35, dated the 12th December 1935, from O.K.

Caroe, Esquire, C.I.E., Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. In reply to your demi-official letter No. F.489-N/35, dated the 12th instant, I wish further to say that the questicei relating to reciprocity between the Governments of His Majesty the King of England and that of His Imperial Majesty the Shah regarding the procedure of flying flags has been finally determined, and consequent ly the Iranian Legation and Consulates in England fly their flags over their respective building only on Iranian and English public holidays; but this principle of reciprocity does not apply to India in so far as the prac- tlce of flying flags is concerned. The custom out here is thfit the representatives of all foreign Governments in Bombay, Calcutta and Delhi whose relations with the Government of Kis Britannic Majesty are undoubtedly based on reciprocity are free to fly their flags every day without any restriction. Therefore, I do not see any valid reason for the Government of India to inpose tills restriction only on Iran, and exempt thEfcr other Govern ments from following the procedure laid down in connection with this matter.COPY (E 6789/1999/34) NO. 173/0-10.

Yours ever Chancery The Eastern Department, The Foreign OfficeNo. 173/0-6. Br i t;ish&lt;b«ge t i on, Tehran. August 10th, 1935 Thank you for your letter No. D.0. F.205-N/35 of the 29th July about the flying of national flags by consular officers in India and Iran. 2. I see no objection to the proposal to restrict the flying of flags by Iranian Consuls in India, and I agree that the Iranian Government could hardly appeal to Article 9 of the 1857 Treaty in this case. I think, however, that I should point out that it is not strictly accurate to say that the Iranian Government do not permit the flying of flags by Consular Officers every day. The decision not to fly flags every day was indeed taken as a result of a request from the Minister of Foreign Affairs, but it was a voluntary one and is to be regarded as a favour on our part. I think therefore that any approach to the Iranian Consul-General should be in the nature of a polite request based on that magic principle of reciprocity, so dear to the Iranian mind. 3. As you will see from our despatch No. 209 of the 19th October, 1934, our Consuls fly their flags every Sunday. I think therefore that it would be as well to allow Iranian Consular Officers in India to fly their flags on Fridays as well as on the days suggested in paragraph 2 of your letter. (Signed) H.M.

We are very pleased everything went off so smoothly. There is just one point which we feel we ought to raise in case it ever crops up in Delhi. You are not quite correct in saying that we only fly our flag on Sundays and on British and Iranian holidays and festivals, since we also fly it on the principal national day of every foreign country represented in Iran by a resident diplomat (e.g. on the national days of France, Belgium, U.S#A. etc. but not on those of Austria, Finland, Lithuania and Norway whose representatives all reside elsewhere). Should the Iranian Consul-General ever wish to claim reciprocity in this, we think it would perhaps be difficult to refuse it./125 j IMP* Bl aL IRaNUH CO ftiUlATiJ Simla, the Omar Monsieur Garoe nL With reftorenoe to /oar D«0« %&gt;• D.370 dated the Au^uet 1955, and the conversation which I had with you and Mr* Aoheson regarding the deporta tion or Barharis (Hazarae), I write to 8a/ that I have twice made enquiries Iroiu the authorities in Teheran in connection with this matter, and they have inrormed me that they hate decided to deport only those persons who are derinltely known to the looal authorities to have participated in the recent riots at Meshed.

The Foreign Secretory to the Govt, of India is directed to invite the attention of the Consul General for Iran in India to the question of the procedure to be followed as regards the flying of flags at Consulates in Iran and India. The position is that prior to 1933 H.M's and other Consular offlc rs in Iran used to fly their flag over their Consulate buildings every day and without any restriction .

Previous papers :■ SUBJECT. PERSIA. to FOR INFORMATION. The Government of India propose to restrict the flying of the Persian national flag hy Persian Consulates in India to the occasions of Persian and Indian gazetted holidays. Diplomatic missions and consulates in Persia are now only allowed to fly their flags on national holidays. (See Minute at P.Z. 724/35)• It would seem, therefore, that the Persian Government could hardly ohject to the reciprocal action which the Government of India are now proposing to take. Article 9 of the Anglo-Persian Treaty of 1857 lays down, however, that in the establishment and recognition of Consuls-general. Consuls, Vice-Consuls and Consular agents, each party should he placed 3330 1000 12.34 in the dominions of the other on the footing of the/of the most-favoured nation. The Government of India* however* contend that the flying of flags hardly comes within the scope of this article. This view is pro'ba'bly correct* 'but they are consulting Kis Lajesty^ Minister at Tehran before taking the proposed action.Foreign and Political Departmsnt. SIMLA. The 29th July 1935. SsMifontthi. D.O. No. P.205-N/36 I am desired to invite a reference to Sir Reginald Hoare's Despatch No. 132. dated 25th Jun e 1932, regarding the flying of national flags by His Majesty's Consular Officers in Iran. It has now become generally known in India through travellers returning from Iran that the Iranian Governnent do not permit His Majesty's Consular Officers in that country to plant flagstaffs in the grounds of their residences or to fly their national flag every day. It has been pointed out to the Governnent of India that this attitude of the Iranian Governnent is not consistent with the practice observed by Iranian Consular Officers in India; for instance, the Consul-General for Iran in India has affixed a large flag to the porch of his house at Simla immediately opposite the residence of His Excellency the Conmander-in-Chief in India, and flies his flag daily without ary restriction. 2. The Governnent of India consider that the time has come when they should take reciprocal action in this matter. They therefore propose to inform the Consul General for Iran in India that with effect from 1st of October 1935 he and his subordinate consular officers in India will bo permitted to fly flags on a flagstaff affixed to their consular buildings, and only on the occasion of^Iranian holidays referred to in paragraph 3 of Sir Reginald Hoare's circular letter No. 21, &lt;i*ted 19th October 1954, and the Governnent of India's gazetted holidays, a list of vhich is enclosed. 3 93. Before making this propo#al the Government of India have considered the implications of Article 9 of the Anglo- Persian Treaty of 1057, whereby the Iranian Government, under an agreement which is believed to be unique, is entitled to most favoured nation treatment in the matter of establishment and recognition of its Consulates in India. They admit that, if privileges in respect of the flying of flags were within the scope of the Article cited, the withdrawal of any such privilege granted to other Consulates in India from Iranian Consulates only would amount to a contravention of this Article. But they are clearly of the opinion that privileges in the matter of the flying of flags are wholly outside the scope of Article 9. Nor do they consider that the Iranian Government, particularly in visw of their own action in Iran, would be on strong ground in raising objection to the proposed restriction as a contravention of the Article cited. Nor again does it seem that the fact that all Legations in Iran have agreed to restrictions, which the Government of India understand are opposed to internation al custom, could legitimately be cited in favour of a demand that reciprocal and restrictive action in this matter directs against Iranian Consulates in India must be followed by imposition of similar restrictions on the consulates of all foreign States in this country, 4. Before taking the action specified above the Government of India will be glad to learn whether you see anyany objection to the action proposed by them* Yours sincerely, Sd/- J. Gr. Acheson.

It cIor.y^ is also from the correspondence that even when the Consul is present at Bunder Abbas the flag is in future to be flown only on 'British national holidays and on Sundays' in accordance with Persian 'regulations', although at other posts in Persia we have hitherto succeeded in continuing to fly our flags every day. 2730 1000 4.34 In/In view of this revival of the 'days” question the G.of I. enquired whether the Legation now considered it advisable to take retaliatory action against the Persian Visa and Passport Officer at Quetta (who flies a flag from a flagstaff planted in the ground which the Persian authorities have forbidden foreign Consuls in Persia to do) as previously suggested in 1932 by Sir Reginald Hoare in the event of the Persians reviving the 'days' question (please see P.Z.5086/32). H.M.Minister has however replied (P.Z.6132/34) to the G.of I.»s enquiry that he considers that it would be unwise in the present instance to adopt this course, &lt;s since the position at Bunder Abbas being- somewhat different from that at other Consulates in Persia, V' it is probable that if he were to raise the question of flag flying there, the Persian Government would — reopen the more important issue - at present quiescent - of flag-flying at all Consulates. It is satisfactory to learn from this that the Persians are not at present pursuing the general question of the flying of flags every day at all British Consulates, and in view of this we may, I think, agree with the Minister 1 s view as regards Bunder Abbas. l/e T&amp;L ^dtJL A A JVa^r o-u&gt;i 7 V* ccJliAQftr To- o(o— - /j ’ * Jot: ^ -i' -v* ' J &gt; IW |r 1from His &amp;ajesty«s Td.nlster, Tehran, to ^.3. the Bight Hon. the Harl cf Tillingdon, etc., Foreign and Political ■Department of the Government of India, Siiala.

The position at Bander Abbas is somewhat different from that at other Consulates in Persia, It is now only an office visited by the Consul at Kerman on comparatively rare occasions. If I were to raise the question of flag-flying with regard to Bander Abbas, it is probable that the Persian Government would re-open the more important issue, - at present quiescent, - of flag-flying on all Consulates. As our position in this question is weak ir International Law, I consider it unwise to run any risk of provoking the Persian Government. \ v 136 Uptec 13 SEP. 1 _Sir, JrotA gy r Al r Mail* v / / Copy sen t to Indi a Office and Bushire. 4c hr VU The Deputy Secretary to tht ol India Pv t in the fbrei&amp;n and Political Department, Hie Majesty* e Charge d* ATI sires, Tehran.

Of course, at times when the Consul occupies the building, it will he possible in accordance with the regulations which I have formerly communicated to four Excellency, to fly the flag over the gate of the building on British National holidays and on Sundays as practised by the other foreign Consulates in Persia, but there will be no question of flying the flag when the Consul is not present at Bandar Abbas.s * 4 smimmui* N6.716-S of 1934* The Hon , 'ble the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf presents his compliments to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Simla, and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of the undermentioned document.

Previous Papers :•Minute Paper. Political Department. Please see previous Minutes at P.Z.1865/32 and P*2.5086/32. The general views of the Foreign Office regarding the question of the flying of flags by foreigners in Persia are set forth in their despatch No.670 of 16th November, 1931 to Teheran (flagged). It will be seen from that despatch that the Foreign Office are of opinion that an attempt by the Persian Government to control the flying of flags by Diplomatic Missions in Persia is not in accordance with international law and custom and that any attempt on the part of the Persian Government to interfere with the flying of flags in the premises of the British Legation at Teheran should be firmly resisted. They consider^ however, that in regard to Consulates, His Majesty f s Government not in such a strong position for refusing to comply with the Persian Governments regulations and that it would not be possible for His MajestyS Minister to do more than endeavour to persuade the Persian Government not to adopt an unreasonable attitude. The Foreign Office further express^the opinion that the question of the flying of flags by Diplomatic Missions and Consulates in Persians essentially one for discussion by the Diplomatic Body at Teheran with a view to the formation of a united front for making representations to the Persian Government. It will be remembered that last year we were forced to discontinue the flying of Consular flags from flagstaffs planted in the ground (which in the Persian view implies sovereignty over the ground in which the flagstaff is planted), and to transfer these flags to the/ 1712b 5000 3.33 mmmthe Consular buildings or gateways. The Persians have now returned to the charge on the question of the flying of Diplomatic and Consular flags every day instead of only on certain holidays which the Persian Crovernment regard as in accordance with the 'usual' custom, and the head of the Protocol Department of the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs has taken it upon himself to address direct to the heads of all foreign missions at Teheran a circular letter (page 3 of the enclosures to the Foreign Office letter) asking them to restrict the flying of flags to ceremonial occasions. A copy of the Persian regulations to which the letter refers is at flag E in the file. The matter was discussed at an indignation meeting of the Diplomatic Body at which it was finally agreed th^t after a suitable period of time had been allowed to elapse the Turkish Ambassador as Doyen should explain to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that M. Braghon/s letter was unacceptable and would not be answered, but if His Highness chose to address the Doyen requesting that flags be only flown on ceremonial occasions and making it perfectly clear that this was asked as a matte^ of courtesy and not of right, the Diplomatic Body would give the matter its consideration. The Turkish Ambassador would explain to Feroughi that with regard to Consulates there were definite practical advantages in flying flags every day but would make it clear that the Diplomatic Body did not assert the same position in respect of Consulates as in respect of Fhbassies or Lega It appears, however, from a statement made by the Iraqi Charge d*Affaires at Teheran that Iraq Legations and Consulates are required by law to fly their flags every day. If this is confirmed from Baghdad and if the Iraq Government, in view of their legislation, refus to instruct their Consulates in the sense desired by the ions.Minute Paper. Department. Persian Government, Mr. Hoare has asked for instructions as to the line which he should take and whether he should support the Iraqi Government in its refusal. The Foreign Office consider that it would be most undesirable that His Majesty f s Government should fail to support the Iraqi Government in this matter and, subject to the concurrence of this Office, they propose to instruct Mr. Hoare (? to attempt) to dissuade his diplomatic colleagues from agreeing to any change in the existing practice unless and until agreement has been reached between the Persian and Iraqi Governments; and to inform him that it should in any case be made quite clear to the Persians that any concession which may eventually be made as regards the diplomatic flag is voluntarily revocable and dictated solely by considerations of courtesy. The Persians have consistently adopted a most unreasonable and discourteous attitude in regard to this question and it is submitted that we may agree with the Foreign Office proposal. If Mr. Hoare is able to persuade his colleagues to form a united front against the Persians in this matter it seems improbable, as the Foreign Office say, that the Persian authorities would carry out a threat to remove Consular flags by force, but the Foreign Office consiaer that in any case in view of the question of principle at stake the risk should be faced. If the Persians should prove obdurate in insisting that flags should not be flown at British Consulates every day, it will be for consideration whether action should be taken against the Persian Visa Officer at Quetta as suggested in Mr. Hoare's Despatch of 25th June last to the Government of India (P.2.5086/32)1Draft Paper.

With reference to your letter No. P.Z.5086/32 of the 23rd August, 1932 and connected correspondence regarding the flying of flags at His Majesty’s Consulates in Persia, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to transmit to you, to be laid before Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare, the accompanying copies of two despatches from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran on this subject. 2. Sir John Simon is strongly of the opinion that in this matter the diplomatic corps at Tehran should as far as possible present a united front. The substance of the Persian request is unreasonable, and the manner of its presentation offensive and inacceptable. Moreover, in view of the special relations between His Majesty’s Grovernment in the United Kingdom and the Iraqi Government, it would be undesirable that His Majesty’s Government should fail to support the latter in this matter. 3. As regards the risk to which Mr. Hoare refers in the final sentence of paragraph 5 of his despatch No.208, it will be recalled that His Majesty’s Government have already gone a long way to meet Persian susceptibilities by arranging that flags hitherto flown from flagstaffs in the grounds of His Majesty’s Consulates should be flown from the consular buildings. It is, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, improbable that the Persian authorities would carry out a threat The Under-Secretary of State, India Office.threat to remove consular flags by force, and, although admittedly such action would cause a serious situation, he considers that this risk should he faced in view of the important questions of principle which are at stake, 4 # sir John Simon proposes, therefore, subject to the concurrence of Sir Samuel Hoare, to instruct Mr, Hoare to dissuade his diplomatic colleagues from agreeing to any change in the existing practice unless and until agreement has been reached between the Persian and Iraqi Governments; and to inform him that it should in any case be made quite clear to the Persian Government that any concession which may eventually be made as regards the diplomatic flag is voluntary, revocable, and dictated solely by considerations of courtesy. 5.

If this proves to be the ease, I see no objeetlon, so far as His Majesty's Legation is concerned, in following any course that seems suitable to my colleagues as a whole. 5. On the question of Consulates we stand practically alone, unless the Soviet Embassy should show an unexpected interest in the question. Some other countries have Consulates in different parts of the country, but they are too few to be of importance. In dealing with this question I shall bear in mind the instructions contained in paragraph 6 of your desp atch No. 670 of November 16th, 1951 (E 6420/4976/54). Until the meeting of heads of missions has taken place it is difficult to formulate a precise line of policy, but if it proves necessary to /restrict The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., etc., etc., etc.. The Foreign Office.- 2 - restrict the flying of Consular flags to special occasions* I shall probably tell the Minister for Foreign Affairs that at certain poets this restriction can only be carried into effect gradually 9 and that at all posts the Consul will renain the sole judge Cf what is or is not a special occasion. 4 # I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Gowemaent of India (No. 86). I have the honour to be with the highest respect* Sir* Tour aost obedient* humble Serrant* (Signed) R. H. Hoare.m) in Tehran despatch No« 202 of th« 23nd April. 1953, j Tranfilatiaai Pro* Mirza F&amp;rrukh Khan Braghon, of tha protocol X&gt;epartaent of tho Ministry for Foreign Affair*, adaressed to His Britannic Majesty'* Minister. Un-numberecu Bated FarTardine J30th, 1312 (April 9th, 1933). My dear Minister, I hare the honour to trouble Your Excellency with the following facts. In view of the fact that erery foreign political institution, consulate and subject used to fly their national flags in their own particular way, and in order that there should be no further grounds for any *1sunderstending^ in the matter, on the 3rd of Mehr Mah 1310 (September 26th, 1931) a Circular Memorandum under number 22363 was sent out to all the honourable foreign Legations in Tehran concerning the arrangements for flying and fixing foreign flags in Persia by foreign Legations, Consulates and individuals. In view of the confidence which exiets in the compliance exhibited by the honourable Legations in the execution of national dispositions, it was certainly expected that the provisions of paragraph 2 of the above~ mentioned circular memorandum would be put in practice by the honourable Legations and consulates concerned. However, it is observed with regret that they have not shown the attention to this matter which was expected; and since the present method of flying flags is contrary both to national and international practice in this sense that at a time when complete eeourity and tranquility reigns they fly flags ever; day just as if a state of danger exists, an unfortunate effe is produced on (men’s) minds; and you will of course agree that it Is contrary to the practice existing in other countries. Hence I have the honour to request Your Excellency to be so good as to arrange that the provisions /laid2 \lV laid down in the ahOTe-aentioned circular should be practiced in that honourable Legation and its consulates* Awaiting Your Excellency’s friendly reply I avail myself of the opportunity, etc., etc., (Signed) P. Braghon*British Legation* E '2520 TAHRAH April S36th 1933 Sir* I hare the honour to report in continuation of My despatch No* 202 dated April 22nd that the Diplomatic Corpa ~ with the exception of a representatire of the Soviet Eahassy and of the Polish Legation - net this afternoon to discuss the circular froa the head of the Protocol Department on the subject of the flying of flags. 2. After general indignation in varying tones of vehemence had been expressed at the terms of Monsieur Braghon’s letter and at the fact that he had taken upon himself to address us direct* the meeting gradually got down to business. Opinion was more or less evenly divided* one school of thought* mainly voiced by the French Minister, being that if we did not agree with our adversary quickly we should probably find that* by interfering with the delivery of our parcels and other delicate attentions* he would make us rue our recalcitrance; the other view waa that aa soon as we had given way in this matter the Persians would attack us on another point. 5. It was finally agreed that on his return from a trip to Isfahan and Shira* in about a fortnight’s time the Turkish Ambassador as Doyen would explain to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that Monsieur Braghon’a letter waa unacceptable and would not be answered. If His Highness chose to address the Doyen requesting that flags be only flown on ceremonial occasions and making it perfectly clear that this waa asked as a matter of courtesy Right Honourable Sir John Simon Q.C.S.I.* etc.* etc.* ete.* FORMON OFFICII. f ^©/ - 2 . courtesy and not as a natter of right 9 the diplomatic body would gire the natter its consideration* 4* 3o far as the Consulates were concerned the Turkish Anhassador would explain to Feroughi that there were definite practical adwantagea in their being flown every day and would 9 at the sane tine, make it clear that we did not assert the same position in respect of Consulates as in respect of Smhaeelee or Legations* 5* An interesting point was nade by the Iraqi Chargl d f Affaires who stated that Iraq Legations and Consulates were required by law to fly their flags every day* I an asking Hia Majesty's Ambassador at Baghdad to be ao good aa to inform me whether this is indeed the case* If it is, and if f as they certainly will* the Persian Government insist that Consular flags must only be flown on special occasions* 1 shall be grateful for your instructions as to the line which 1 am to take* Supposing that the Iraq Govemnant* in view of thagr legislation* refuse to instruct their Consulates in the sense desired by tie Persian Government* it is quite possible that the latter would eventually threaten to instruct the local police to haul down the flag (see my despatch No* 91 of 24th February 1952)* The question therefore arises whether I should urge my Colleagues to insist that no change be made until an agreement has been reached between the Persian and Iraq Governments* or state that His Majesty’s Government are unwilling to risk incidents over a matter which is essentially of secondary importance* 6 * 1 am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No* 89) and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad (Mo* 31)* I have the honour to be with the highest respect.

II. 01868/58 (secret, of the 9th June regarding the flying of the ^hite Ensign from the nav&amp;l flageteff et Hen^am, X m directed by Secretary sir John Simon to request you to draw the attention of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to the following considerations. 2. The status quo arrangement referred to in paragraph 2 of your letter was introduced some considerable time before the treaty negotiations were suspended and there was no suggestion, so far as Sir John Oimon is aware, that it should only cover the &gt;©riod receding the resumption of negotiations. The arrangement, for what it is worth, is still in force and, though it is admittedly of a somewhat nebulous character, the Secretary of itate considers that it would be possible and desirable to appeal to it, as a first line of defence, in the event of further difficulties connected with the flying of the White I nalgn at juenjam. The fact tiu/t the Minister of Court has not yet answered Mr. joM's letter of the «i^nd I ^rch, ( a copy of which was forwarded to you under cover of Foreign Office letter Be*£.2055 1 54 of the 2nd May) may however indicate that he has decided not to pursue the matter further so long as the treaty negotiations are continued. 3. If, on the other hand, Teyraourtache raiees the question while the negotiations arestill in progress and if, further, hs/he refuses to tidalt thfat the case is covered by the status quo arrangement, 31r ^Tohn Simon agrees that an effort might be made to compromise by offering to transfer the flag from the present flagstaff to one of the buildings which fom the naval depot and by explaining that the White i.nsign, unlike the Union Jack, is not an emblem of ) rltlsh nationality when flown ashore. It is, however, almost certain, as Is recognised in paragraph 5 of your letter, that such an explanation would fail t© convince the Minister of Court and it is therefore not unlikely that he might continue to press for the total removal of the flag. In that event it might still be possible to teoiuorlse for a short period; but sooner or later the choice would lie between complying with the Persian wishes and definitely refusing to do so; and refusal would inevitably increase the risk of a demand on the part of the Persian -ovcmment for the early evacuation of the dep&amp;t. 4. As 'Their lordships are aware, this is a situation, which, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, may arise at any stage of the treaty negotiations. In that event it may be possible, as Their Lordships suggest, to use the remev&amp;l of the ensign as a bargaining counter to secure from the Lersian Government the facilities required at HenjML The possibility cannot, however, be ignored that a final decision may be called for before His Majesty's Government are able to secure a definite promise of such facilities. 6* A copy of this letter is being sent to the India Office, X am, dir, YYour obedient Servant,(•MX No. 173-36. Dear Hichardson, / n V %/ f April 30th, 1932. /vr(V- jt navigation purposes* that the flag flown from the flagstaff is marlced on charts and shown in the 'Pilot' as the flagstaff Iftanks for your letter No. IQ/fceiman/HMC of April — — 20th* enclosing a copy of the Admiralty letter of January llth to the India Office atout the flagstaff. We fear that tt it would do no good for us to approach the Persian Government now about the navigational uses of the flagstaff or to ask that the Consulate flag should again be allowed to fly from it. The same situation existed at Bushire, but the weakness of the argument is that it is not necessary* fo s should be a British flag. If we were to say that flagstaff/of the British Consulate and might not be recognised as such if the British flag were not seen flying from it the Persian Government would be likely to reply that a routine 'notice to mariners' would soon explain the position. We are not in a position to judge the absence of any flag detracts from the navigational value of the flagstaff. If it does so* we could perhaps consider asking the Persian Government whether they would have any objection to a signal//^ of some kind being flown. We are sending copies of this letter to the Government of India (No. 89), and to theHon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (No. 70), reference your despatch No. 6 of the 15th March 1932.

It seems probable that in the near future the question of the flagstaff at Henjam and particularly that of flying the white ensign continuously there will be raised by Persia in connection with the general negotiations now proceeding at Tehran. The Senior Naval Officer in this letter deals mainly with the point as to whether the question should be regarded as part of the status quo arrangement. mat arrangement, however, was merely to cover the period during which negotiations were postponed and whether it comes under it or not is a minor Issue. It is evident that tne main question will hrve to be faced. The Under Secretary of State FOREIGN OFFICE.f.7 3. In Tehran telegram No.228 of 7th October,1931 a copy of which was sent to this Department in Foreign Office letter No.fi,5094/841/34 of ©th October 1931, it is stated that, the Senior Naval Officer’s opinion is that so long as the depot is maintained at Henjam it is essential for the purpose of prestige that the white ensign should be kept flying. On the other hand it is quite possible that, as Persia*a main objection to our remaining is that it is inconsistent with Persia 1 ! sovereignty, insistence on keeping the flag flying there may be a decisive \ factor in causing Persia to press for our withdrawal. If we cannot resist such pressure, we are likely to be faced with much greater loss of prestige by evacuation than by giving way on this point. 4. My Lords would suggest that in the first instance it should be intimated to the iersians that as a part of the new agreement which we are attempting to reach, we would make a concession regarding the flag by transferring it from a ground flagstaff to one of the buildings which is our property. It should further be emphasised to the Persian Minister that the white ensign flown ashore is not an emblem of British nationalit; the union jack is, and it is this latter flag that is flown to denote British occupation overseas, so that the flying of the white ensign from a building can in no wise ci jnify any claim to • • • •-3- to poeseee the territory on which the building stands: it is simply an emblem of naral ownership of the building. My Lords consider that it might also usefully be pointed out that at wei Hai Wei, while the territory was administered by this country, the union ^ack flew over the Commissioner's house; when the administration reverted to China the union ^ack was no longer flown but the white ensign continues to fly, as before, over the naval canteen. 5. On the other hand the view that the white ensign flown ashore is not an emblem of British nationality may not be very convincing or palatable to the Persians. It may appear.to them somewhat inconsistent to assert that we only want recreational, fuelling and storing facilities at Henjara, and have no wish to use it as a navai base, and yet to insist on flying the white ensign continuously. It is also pertinent that there is no particular building analogous to a consulate on which it could be claimed the flag should continue to be flown, and there is no defined area which is solely occupied by British personnel. 6. In all the circumstance s , therefore, My Lords consider that, provi ded we get the other facilities we require at Hen jam, it would be politic to meet the Persian wishes on this • • • •4- this point. Such a step •hould, hoiweTer, only be taken as a last resort and as part of the new agreement which we are attempting to reach. 7* The maintenance of the flagstaff for signalling to H#M.Ships is a separate question. As the senior Uaval Officer considers it essential for signalling purposes that the flagstaff should be retained in its present position, My Lords consider that we should not give way on this point. 8.

With reference to my submission dated 17th October, 1931), No#240/466, on the above mentioned subject, I beg to inform you that the question of the flag staff at Henjam has lately become the subject of further discussion at Tehran. 2. During his recent visit to the Gulf, Mr. Hoare f the British Minister, received a telegram from the Charge d'Affairs informing him that Farrukh had stated that the Minister of Court and the Persian War Office did not accept Mr. Hoare's view that the question of the fla* staff at Hen Jam is part of the 'status Quo* arrangement. 3. The Minister asked me for my views on the matter. I informed him that in ray opinion this was a matter of very great importance and that it provided an excellent opportunity of showing that we can take a stand where real principles are involved. I have your telegram of 24th November, 1931, 1904/24, addressed to the secretary of the Admiralty, and repeated to myself. In the absence of other instructions I felt that I was voicing your views and those of the Lords commissioners of the Admiralty when offering it as my opinion that there should be nd compromise on this question, once any matter is clearly divorced from The 'status Quo' arrangement there is no guarantee that all outstanding matters will not be similarly dealt with. 4. i explained that the flag staff was essential for signall ing purposes and that the White ensign flying at the masthead is the outward and visible sign, or token, of the existence of an establishment which is recognised under the 'status Quo . 6. Mr. Hoare replied to TQhran in the sense that th~ only person with whom he will discuss his view of the 'Status Quo' and the interpretation thereof, is the author of toe ^t-tus Quo* arrangement himself. He hopes to be able to pr«^t the matter coming to a head, but he stated that he woiild l^t me know in due course of any developments. 6. ttie 'War Office' mentioned above is a *?* el - diplomatic dealings Jfcrpersia.

Sir, O O ^ Z /- -t 24th February, 1932. 2 ^ It % With reference to your despatch No.670 of November 16th (.8.5420/4975/34) I have the honour to report that on February 3rd I received a telegram from His Majesty’s Consul at Zabul stating that the Governor of Zahedan(jOuzdab) had received instructions to insist on the Vice-Consulate flag being removed immediately from the flag-staff to the building. This telegram was followed almost immediately by a second telegram stating that the Governor of Zabul had written an official letter requiring the removal of the Consulate flag-staff within one weelc(which meant by February 12th)and that the Governor of Zahedan had instructions to remove the Vice-Consulate flag by force if the Vice-Consul failed to remove it of his own accord. On the same day a telegram arrived from the Political Resident at Bushire to the effect that the Governor of the Gulf iOrts had sent him a letter asking that uhe flag of the Consulate-General should be flown from a building or a gate way within one week. Finally a series of telegrams reached me from the Acting Consul at Bander Abbas reporting that the Governor had given him three days(which meant until February 17th) to cease using the Consulate flag-staff, failing which the flag-staff would be dismounted by the police. 2. Upon receiving the first of these telegrams I sought an interview with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, but the The Right Honourable second Sir John Simon, GCSI.,Ftc.,Btc., — Xh^-Foreign Office.

At ..this interview I told Feroughi very frankly what my instructions were,hut that I had hoped that the Persian Government were letting the matter drop. I added that His Majesty* s Government, as well as the Bepresentative at Bushire recognised that the Bushire flag-staff was from its size and position in a class hy itself. As regards other flag-staffs, would His Highness tell me what the objection was to flag-staffs planted in the ground. He replied that there was a general belief that they constituted a claim to sovereign rights. I said that so far as we were concerned this was obviously not the case,because if there had at any time been any idea of putting such a claim forward,flag-staffs would clearly have been planted in the ground at all posts and not only at a few. I went on to protest against the manner in which the Persian Government had in the beginning set about securing the removal of all flag-staffs by means of a published regulation. His Majesty’s Legation should have been approached with ordinary courtesy and told why the Persian Government wanted flag-staffs,that had possibly been in position for years,removed. The action of the governors in saying that they would interfere with flag-staffs situated inside Consulate compounds was more serious still: if the Persian Government found that their regulations were not being obeyed in the provinces I should have been approached openly on the subject. 3. Feroughi was visibly uneasy ana promised to make enquiri es as to whether there was really any objection to the use of flag-staffs situated within Consulate compounds. In the mean while he undertook to have instructions sent to Zabul and Zahedan that no action was to be taken by the local authorities until February 22nd(a similar instruction was later sent to Bander Abbas). But though I have since spoken to him and used* ( 'S&gt; ij) used all x^ossilDle arguments to induce them to recede from their position, I have heen unahle to obtain any guarantee that local authorities will not interfere with Consular flag-staffs. I have, however, made it clear that His Majesty’s Government recognise no right 1 to control Legation flag-flying. 4. I mentioned on ©tie occasion the flag-staff which the Persian vise officer at Quetta is said to be erecting in his ? garden,making it clear that I was not complaining,but merely illustrating how little meaning the Persian thesis evidently had for an orainary Persian official. Although I insisted that the case was of no moment, Peroughi said he must have the &lt; flag-staff removed at once, as the Persian Government could not allow its officials to do in foreign countries what foreign officials were not allowed to do in Persia. After my first interview with Feroughi, I decided that the time had come to use the discretion given to me to remove the flag-staff at Bushire. I accordingly telegraphed to the Political Resident to inform the Governor of the Gulf Ports that he had for some time past been prepared to remove the flag from his flag-staff when reguested to do so and to take Si*) immediate steps to do^if the Governor were guite certain that his instructions to insist on its removal were definite. 1 have since heard that the Political Resident is transferring the upper part of the mast of the flag-staff to the top of the Consulate-General building. 5. This morning,on the occasion of the signature of the Telegraphs Agreement, I had another long conversation with Feroughi,and as a result I am convinced that whatever his personal opinions may be there is no hope of the Persian Government withdrawing from the position they have taken up. Feroughi has however undertaken to inform me what authorities in(«£) in International law iiad “been consulted before the Council of Ministers reached the conclusions embodied in the regula tions. 6. As a result of my interview f I have sent a circular telegram to all Consulates with flag-staffs instructing them to make arrangements forthwith to transfer their flags from the flag-staffs to their buildings or gateways. I have also written a letter to feroughi telling him of my instruc tions and stating that I rely upon him to ensure that no rmxtie incidents occur while these arrangements are being put f ^ I into effect. Copies of the telegram and the letter are enclosed. 7. In my letter to JTeroughi I have given no indication that the flag-staffs will be removed altogether. In some cases, however, it may prove desirable, for reasons both of practical convenience and prestige, to remove the flagstaff « if it is not used. 8. It is a little curious that the Persian Government allowed the matter to lie dormant for many weeks and that action was taken immediately after Teymourtache*s return* Perhaps it was just a coincidence.Copy of telegram Prom:- His Majesty's Minister To s- All Consular Officers in Persia (except Hamaaan ana Sultanaftad) No.l.

My dear Minister, As a result of our conversation this morning I have sent instructions to all British Oonsular posts with flagstaffs planted on the ground to arrange forthwith to erect flag-poles over some building or gateway, as may be most convenient; and to transfer their flag from the flagstaff in the ground to the pole over the building or gateway as soon as the pole is ready. Your Highness will readily understand that there may be some cases in which the erection of a pole of sufficient size and strength over a building not originally designed to carry such a pole may present considerable difficulty. In such cases the pole may not be in a position for some days, or even weeks: in fact I cannot specify any particular period to cover all posts. In the meanwhile I rely upon Your Highness to see that • the local authorities concerned receive such instructions as will ensure that no interference takes place with British Oonsular flags during the period required for the erection of flag-poles. This applies especially to the local authorities at Zabul, Zahedan and Bander Abbas, whose present instructions not to interfere with the British flagstaffs at these places expire on February 22nd,that is to say in four days' time. Your Highness is already aware from our conversation of the views of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom upon this subject. I need only repeat that they consider the opinion of the Imperial Government that a flagstaff planted in the ground is a sign of sovereignty to His Highness Mirza Mohamed Ali Khan Feroughi Minister for Foreign Affairs., / /A .«« x.. ; to 1)6 completely unfounded. Your Highness is also aware of my opinion of the manner in which the Imperial Government sought to put an end to the use of flagstaffss that is to say, firstly hy publishing a general regulation instead of approaching foreign Missions privately and secondly hy issuing instructions to local authorities to remove British Consular flags hy force if they continued to he flown as in the past without previously drawing my attention to the fact that the regulation was not being obeyed. Your Highness undertook in the course of our con'versa tion to make certain enquiries regarding the legal authorities whose opinions led to the issue ol these regulations and I shall he interested to hear the result of these enquiries in due course.

Sir John Simon regrets that owing to the discourteous and precipitate manner in which the Persian Government have seen fit to reopen the question, Mr. Hoare had no alternative but to avail himself without delay of the authority given to his predecessor to arrange if necessary for the removal of the Bushire flagstaff, and it was thus impossible to consult Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare previously as suggested in paragraph 3 of your letter under reference.

In my humble opinion, it is most important as has hitherto been the practice throughout Persia that the flag should be flown daily at all seaport towns where there are Consulates with a view to uphold British prestige, not only this, but it will be useful to British shipping in indicating the location of the Consulate. At Bandar Abbas, the flag-staff with the flag flying also serves as a navigation mark. 3. Alluding to paragraph 2 of my despatch Ko.25 of the 15th instant, I would report that the local authorities on the strength of Ministerial Circular No.17161 of the 17th Shaliwar 1310 (9.9.1931), have demanded the removal of the flag-staff from the ground in which it is fixed at the Consulate at Bandar Abbas. I have replied to the effect that in accordance with section 4 of the instructions transmitted to them, the matter is being reported to Kis Majesty* s legation at Tehran with a view to discussion of the question with the Ministry for foreign Affairs. In conclusion, I venture to hope that the demand of the Persian Covernment will be successfully resisted, as I consi der that orders for the removal of the flag-staff referred to will be regarded both by British subjects and the local Persian residents as a distinct blow to our prestige.

The Government of India expressed the view in reply that it would be impolitic to claim any special position for ;the Company, which is to be regarded as a purely private 'concern, and consequently that the officials of the Company 'ILk, 7U&gt; should be treated as having right^ to tene*/ more than un-officiel British subjects tetr are entitled^ ccording to international usage to fly their national flag on days of festival or commemoration rv^ ww j It appears that the Persian objection to the t fly ^ flying of flags from flag-staffs planted in the ground is derived from the oriental idea that the soil in which the *■* / ' , flag is planted is assumed to have the character of the flag which flies over it. JHfi this idea is explained in Colonel Haworth's letter of £3rd July 1927, flagged in the file, to which the Government of India invited attention. It is proposed in replying to the Foreign Office to pupport the Government of India's view as to the status » 3000 8/:U of/S' 1 of the Communications Company but to suggest that we should be glad to be consulted further should the question again be raised 0 / the removal of the ilag-staif 1 rom the Bushire Residency or that at the Naval Signalling Station at Henjam. -Foreign Oifice have issued instructions as to the 1 lying 01 Hags irom diplomatic and consular buildings^ based on recognised international usage in other countries^and it is not proposed to offer any observations on this point, which is mainly one for the Foreign Office to determine.

British Reaidericy k Consulate-General, Bushire, the 2nd Horember 1931. Sir, I itere the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Circular telegram Bo.12 of the 14th October 1931, asking me to report how far I consider compliance to Persian demanda regarding flying of flags by foreign consulates would affect British prestige in nay district. In reply I have ne hesita tion in saying that I think it would ^ifect British prestige very considerably, and it is course for ttij .3 reason that the Pereiane are now trying to impose restrict!one and to prohibit the flying of flags except on nati nal fete days. 2. Conditions in Persia are not analogous to those in European countries, and the laj ge bulk of the population are uneducated and primitive, and these emblems do undoubted ly impress them, and the fact that the national 1 lag is flown over the official residence of a consular officer does undoubtedly give him in their eyes a special status and prsstige. If this privilege was removed it would undoubted ly be regarded as a great victory for the Persian Government and a great 'climb down' on the part of foreign representa tives, and the fact would certainly be blazoned forth in the local press, and in the syes of the ordinary man in the street the status of the consular officer would be little different from that of the representative of a coumercial firm. • His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, British Legation, Tehran.firm. 3. The effect would, I think, vary to eoiae extent according to locality. tfhere the consular residence is situated in the middle of a town, surrounded toy other buildings, as for instance Meshed, where the flag is flown over the gate, the coat of arms over the gate is a much more visible emblem to every passer*by than the flag. X doubt whether one in a thousc-ud persons would ever notice whether the flag war being flown or not. In other places, however, where the consulate is a conspioious building outside the town, as in the case of most places in Persia, the absence of the flag would certainly be very noticeable and create much comment. Neither wo &lt;ld restricted permission to fly it on national ffcte days mend matters at alls on the contrary if it is flown for instance on 3 days in the year only I think it would but serve to emphasise the fact that it could not be flown on the other 362 days, and in these circumstances it would probably be preferable not to fly flags at all and to have no flagstaff. 4 # in this connection there is one other point that I should like to raise, and that is the question of the flying of flags by officials of the Imperial and International Communications limited at telegraph stations. In ^ore^gn Office despatch Ho.32 of the 15th September 1931 it is said that * in the absence of any regulation in Persian law to the contrary, these officials are entitled to fly their nati nal flag*. and it is laid down that the Union Jack may be flown toy ahy British subject, on land. How whatever may be the technicalities of the matter and the rights of British subjects, I would venture to point out that, in Persia at any rate, the Union Jack is regarded entirely as an ofiicial flag, alike X believe ...-a. believe by tMe Persians and by anti ah aubjecta, ana in *y 10 years' service in different pavts of tne country I have never seen it flown anywhere except over an official residence, and even in those more spacious days befors ths war I m convinced that if any British subject had hoisted the British flafe over his house protest would at once have been received from the itersian authorities, and for very good reasons, since the British flag denoted the right of sanctuary ana extra-territorial ity, and, vhile the Persians had perforce to concede this right in the case of an official residence, they would not ever have done so in the case of a orivate house. I would therefore very much deprecate my flying of the Union JacJc over other than official buildings, and I am confident that the Imperial and International Cocmiunica- ^ onpahy will willingly oe guided toy any advice tendei -ed to tfem in this respect, having regard to the special conditions prevailing in .Persia. of course if sub sequently any of their officials are given any Consular status then he would naturally ily the Union Jaox over his Its 810.6 ft C 6 e er ® remains the question of the two flagstaffs at hen Jam; at one of them the white ensign is flown denoting the presence of Indian marine ratings ana on the other no flag is now flown, though, I believe, formerly, ue jo re ifce Indo-iiuropean Telegraph department was abolished, the Union Jack was flown, but on this point I am mot quite ce now rtain. Anyhow, the only question/at issue is tiiat of the flying of the white ensign and 1 suggest that this mignt be treated as a separate question and the Persian authorities asked to allow the matter to stand over until the question of the henjam Protocol is definitely settled. 6 . finally, apart from the general question# there i. th. articular case of the mm hire fiagatarf outaiae ttt. town « oidency. Dow it mat be admittea frankly that thie■NMKp 1 flagstaff is. If 1 may say bo, distinctly blatant* It dominates the town and is the one flagstaff that forms a conspicuous object from the sea. Personally 1 see no great objection really to pulling it down and erecting a flagstaff on the top of the building; unfortunately the matter has become a sort of test case and assumed an importance that it need never really have had, but if the Persian Government can be prevailed upon to grant un restricted pennies ion to fly the customary official flag 1 see no great objection to making some concession to them over the flagstaff, and agreeing to substitute for it a flag flown over the building* 2 am sending a copy of this despatch to the Government of India and to His majesty*a oecretary of State for India 2 have tii* honour to be. sir, Your moat obedient humble servant, (at/ H.

DODD.7 ■ Ho. 670. (K 5420/4976/34) POR-’IIGH OPPIC 1 :, 8 . .1 J 16th Hovemher, 19ol Sir f I have received Mr* I^dd’e despatches Ho* 514 of Septeiaber 21 and Nos* 552 and 555 of October 6 , regarding the nev, i crsian regulations regrrding the flying of flsgs by foreign nationals in ferei a* I am not yet in possession of the views of the Government of India upon the (iuestione at issue, but you should be guided, pending the receipt of further instructions, by the following considerations based upon ordinary international custom* * 2, No objection can be taken to any restrictions which Persian regulations nay impose on the flying of flags by private persons and institutions, provided that British subjects are not treated in this respect differently from other* foreign nationals. British subjects and institutions of an unofficial nature should therefore be strongly advised in their own interests, to comply immediately and without cxuestion with the Persian regulations. 3. On the other hand, any attempt on the part of the Persian Government to control the flying of flags on foreign diplomatic buildings or from flagetaffs in their grounds is not in accordance with international law and custom which, so far as they have a bearing on the question, tend towards non-interference by the State to which the diplomatic Representative is accredited* His llajesty’s Government would not, for example, attempt to prevent the Persian R*H. Hoare, Esq., C*M*G*, Ac* , Tehran*a Persian Legation in London from flying the Persian flag continuously throughout the year, whether on the Legation building or from a flagstaff in its grounds. I consider therefore that any attempt on the part of the Persian Government to interfere with the flying of flags in the Legation premises at Tehran or Gulhek should be firmly resisted, and, should you be approached on this subject by the Persian Government, you are authorised, if you consider it desirable, to reply that you have definite instructions from His Majesty’s Government not to alter the present arrangements. 4. With regard to Consulates, His Majesty’s Government would not be in such a strong position for refusing to conroly with the Persian Govemraont’s regulations, and it would not be possible for you to do more than endeavour to persuade the Persian Government not to adopt an unreasonable attitude. It may be oointed out to them if necessary that other Governments, including His Majesty’s Government, do not attempt to interfere with the flying by foreign Consulates of their national flags, and that the flying of the Consulate’s flag from a flagstaff in the ground is not uncommon. The Persian Government might be asked on what they base their apparent assumption that a flagstaff fixed in the ground, instead of on a building, constitutes a threat to their sovereignty; and it may be Pointed out that the only considerations which His Majesty f s Government recognise as entering into the question of the position of a Consular flag are those of practical convenience. It is immaterial, in their opinion, whether a Consular flag is flown from a horizontal, sloping or vortical staff, and whether it is flown from the roof, from any other portion of the building, or from the ground. The object of flyinga Consular flag is to mark the position of the Consulate and the only consideration which, in the opinion of His X&amp;jtsty'ft Qovernment requires to he taken into account with regard to the position of the flag, is that it obviously must he flown from a position where it can he seen. ( 5. If then the Persian Government challenge the practice of His Majesty’s Consuls in flying the consular flag every day, and not merely on special occasions, you should explain that this is in accordance with ordinary I practice, and you should invite them to recognise that the object of flying a Consular flag is to mark the whereabouts of the Consulate, so that it is only reasonable that it should be flown daily. If they challenge the flying of a Consular flag from a flagstaff in the ground, the question of the action to be taken must depend largely on the question whether the flag can equally well be seen if flown from the building itself. If so, I find it difficult to believe that considerations of British prestige render it imperative to maintain the existing arrangements and to enter upon a controversy with the Persian Government on a ooint on which, apart from its some hat trivial nature, His Majesty s Government have not a strong case, and would probably be obliged sooner or later to give way; but if not, I trust it may be possible for you to endeavour to induce the Persian Government to adopt a more reasonable and practical attituae by friendly representations on the lines suggested in the preceding paragraph. 6. The question of the flying of flags by Diplomatic Missions and Consulates in Persia appears essentially one forfor discussion i)y the Diplomatic Body at Tehran, and you should consider the desirability of securing unanimous joint representations to the Persian Government in -he hooe of bringing them to a better appreciation of the general practice, and of allaying their apparent suspicions in regard to the implication* of the flying of foreign flags in diplomatic and consular premises. 7. The question whether the Imperial and International Communications Company Limited is to be regarded as a private or semi-official institution will 'be dealt with separately, on receipt of the Government of India’s views.

T/e presume that it is not possible to contest Persian Government’s right to prescribe Regulations governing manner m which national flags shall be flown by private persons or concerns of foreign origin resident or having their places of business in Persia. If this is so no reasonable objection can apparently be taken to provisions of paragraph 1 of Circular memorandum from Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs dated the 26 th September 1931. Imperial and International Communications Company in Persia can also in our view claim no status other than that of private concern, should Company’s officials later be entrusted with Consular functions they would only be entitled as inaividuals to fly consular flag ana position of i********’ Company S.

If His Majesty*s Government feel that they are on safe ground in making such objection we should of course greatly prefer that there were no interference with old established usage, but if not. we thin*, that it would be wiser to give way gracefully now and avoid forcing issue lively to result in humiliation. 4. We observe from Political Resident’s letter No. - 166/686-S., dated the 16th October 1931, that Persian Government apparently intend to enforce new Begulations without discrimination. 5. If His Majesty's Government decide that on grounds of policy existing custom of flying flags on Imperial ana International communications Company Stations should be continued, we are prepared to concur* in suggestion mentioned in paragraph 9 of Tehran Despatch No.555 dated the 6th October 1931. It might provide possible solution, but we are in no doubt that it is better not to claim for Company status other than that of purely private concern.6.

We notice that, in telegraphing to the Government of India, you did not mention the Foreign Office views on this subject, as explained in my letters of October 16 and 26. You may have purposely avoided doing this, so as not to give them a lead one way or another, but we are inclined to think that the Government of India would have found it useful to know what we thought of the whole position before making up their minds, while, as things are, it seems to us that there is an increased possibility of delay in getting the necessary instructions sent off to Tehran. It is clearly desirable to get instructions on this point off to Tehran at the earliest possible moment. Moreover, if, as we at the Foreign Office feel, the Communications J.C.Walton iisq. ,C.B. ,M.C.Communications Company ought in their own interests to comply with Persian regulations and remove their flagstaffs, it seems r* much 'better that they should do so at once on their own • • initiative, rather than wait until they are obliged to do so under pressure from the Persians.

O Dear Walton, * Since I wrote to you on October 16 regarding the naval and telegraph flagstaffs at Henjam, we have received two further despatches from Dodd, Nos.552 and 555 of October 6, regarding the Persian regulations for the flying of foreign flags. Copies of these two new despatches went to you officially on October 21. You will see tnat, in paragraph 9 of Dodd*s despatch No.555, he puts forward tentatively a new suggestion for the flying of flags by the International Communications Company at their stations on the Persian Gulf coast. he suggests that if tnere are good reasons of policy for continuing to fly the British flag at these stations, the Persian flag might, in future, be flown side by side with the Union Jack. We shall be glad to hear what you think of this suggestion. I confess that we, for our part, do not look upon it with favour. We still feel that it would be unsound to try to obtain J.C.Walton, Esq., C.B., M.C.JL /^S obtain special treatment for the Communications Company as a H semi-official 1 ' institution, and that the Company would be well advised in its own interests to comply strictly with Persian regulations in such matters as these. You will see from paragraph 5 of Dodd 1 s despatch, that it would be difficult in his opinion, to induce the Persian Government to make any distinction between the Company and any other private person or institution. We entirely agree as to the difficulty of bringing the Persians into line on this point, and if we were to propose to them a suggestion for flying the two flags side by side, we would certainly nave to try to convince them that there are good reasons why the Communications Company should not comply with the ordinary Persian regulations on the subject. We therefore, are in favour of letting our draft instructions to Tehran, enclosed in my letter of October 16, stand as originally drafted, and I shall be glad to hear, as soon as possible, if you agree.M.02510/31. 7 21 22 nd Ootober, 193X« Dear Hondel, With ref or ©no© to your letter of the 16th October (1$ •5393/041/34) t we concur in the draft telegram to Tehran in reply to Tehran telegram No*289* concerning the naval flagstaff at Honjorn* with the exception that we consider the word W wirele 88 ,, in the last paragraph of the telegram should be emended to read 'signal communication'• The naval flagstaff is distinct from the telegraph flagstaff (vide Acting British Consul General, Buehire't telegram of loth October, Bo* 3(H.) and the senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, hag reported that the Haval flagstaff is ^absolutely necessary for signalling with H«M* Ships in the Roadstead * (vide Tehran telegram No*22C of 7th October), which oloarly implies visual signalling.

Circular memorandum: As each of the Diplomatic and Consular establishments and foreign nationals in Persia are acting in different ways with reference to the hoisting of flags, and with a view to removing all grounds -‘or any possible misunderstanding, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs has the honour to bring to the notice of the foreign legations in Tehran the arrangements in force regarding the hoisting of foreign flags in Persia:- 1. Foreign nationals and institutions may, on their official and national holidays, hoist their national flags on the front of their buildings (’’Facade de la maison' ) from morning till sunset provided that, in the view of the local officials, it wi 1 not be disturbing to public order. 2. The hoisting of the flags of foreign governments on vertical flagstaffs above buildings is exclusively reserved to foreign legations and Consulates which hoist them ordinarily on the occasion of official Persian festivals, their own anuual official festivals and on other holidays. 3. The hoisting of foreign flags on flagstaffs planted in the ground is strictly prohibited. (Sealed) Ministry for Foreign Affairs.( COr^ (E 5186/4976/34) No. 656 f O / &amp; ; British Legation, Gulhek, October 6th, 1931. My Lord Marquess, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt 50 (t+(° of Your Lordship^ despatch No. 525 of September 15th (E 4318/4318/34) regarding the flying of flags by the officials of the Imperial and International Communic ations Company in Persia. 2. With regard to the question of the Persian lew on this subject, my despatch No. 514 of September 21st will have shown that the Persian Government have now issued regulations limiting the occasions on which and the manner in which foreign nationals may fly the flags of their country, but not forbidding the practice altogether. I have now received from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and am transmitting to Your Lordship separately, the text of these regulations as communicated to all foreign missions in Tehran. They are to all intents and pur poses identical with those communicated to Your Lordship h'zS*} in my despatch No. 514. There is no pretence that this regulation rests on any basis in Persian law and it seems doubtful whether the Persian law courts could, on strictly legal grounds, uphold it. *ut the Persian authorities are not yet capable of comprehending the administration of a state under strictly legal relations and in any case, in the event of resistance, a law could be passed through the Majlis in a few days granting the necessary/ The Most Honourable The Marquess of Reading, G.C.B., etc., etc., etc., The Foreign Office.necessary powers. 3. I note that the proper flag to be flown by the Company s oificials is the Union Jack. I shall, however, be glad to receive Your Lordship’s further instructions upon the point raised in paragraph 8 of my despatch No. 514 as to the company’s status. Upon these instructions will depend the category to which the Company must be assimil ated in the . ersian regulations: that is, whether they must, like private persons, restrict the flying of their flags to national holidays and display them only on the fronts of their buildings, or whether, like Consular officers (according to the Persian view), they must, or at least should, restrict the flying of their flags to national holidays, but with permission to hoist them on poles over their buildings, or whether, like Consular officers (according to the British view - assuming that view can be sustained) they may fly their flags unrestrict edly. 4. Tn this connexion I have the honour to enclose a copy of a despatch from the Acting folitical Resident at Bushire regarding the position of the Company’s flag- staffs at Jask, Henjam, Charbar and Bushire. It will be seen that, with the exception of Charbar, the flags are flown from flagstaffe planted in the ground which, accord ing to the i ersian regulations, is forbidden to all foreign nationals and institutions without distinction and that at Charbar the flag is flown from a pole over the building/building, which is forbidden to all but foreign diplomat! missions and consulates. 5. I venture to add that if any distinction is to be made between the Company and any other private person or institution, I shall have to adduce very strong argu ments in support of this contention, as the Persian Government are unlikely to be impressed by such consider ations as that the Company are the agents of His Majesty*i Government (compare the draft Telegraphs Agreement) who hold a monopoly from the Government of the United kingdom, are controlled by that Government and render a service of public utility not only to the United Kingdom but internationally to other States including -ersia herself. The principal motive for pressing for the withdrawal of the Indo- T, ’uropean Telegraph Department was, after all, the dislike of the presence on Persian soil of a foreign State institution conducting a public utility service; and an affirmation that the Imperial and Inter national Communications Company enjoy official status will hardly be met by the Persian Government without protest. 6. I should also explain that in paragraph 3 above I have quoted the Persian regulations as regards the flying of flags by Consulates merely by way of com parison. The performance of quasi-Consular functions by the officials of the Company has been the cause of fre quent complaint by the Persian Government during the past year (see paragraph 1 of my despatch No. 419 of August 6th) and my comparison is not intended in any way to refer to, or to affect, this question. If at any future/future time officials of the Company are entrusted with consular functions hy His Majesty’s Government and recog nised in their Consular capacity by the Persian Government, these officials will presumably be able as individuals to fly the Consular flag, but the position of the Company will not in any way be altered thereby. 7. I also note that, in Your Lordship’s opinion, there is no ruling of international law or usage under which objection could be taken to the flying of flags from masts planted in the ground, as opposed to flags flown from roof-tops. In paragraph 5 of my despatch No. 514, which has crossed Your Lordship’s despatch under reference, I have asked for detailed instructions in view of the fact that the Persian Government have now laid down a definite ruling on this point: and as the Persian Government are unlikely to be swayed by appeals to mere common-sense I should be grateful if I might be furnished with these. 8. It may perhaps be of interest to invite Your Lordship’s reference to clause 7 of the draft lease of the Isle of Tamb provisionally approved by the Sheikh of Ras- el-Khaima, (please see the enclosures in Foreign Office despatch No. 313 (E 2812/280/91) of the 4th June 1931, , namely Fushire despatch No. 252-S to the Secretary of State for India and No. 251-S to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India of the 11th May 1931). In that clause the condition is specifically stipulated that, if the Persian authorities have occasion to fly the Persian flag on the Isle, it is to be flown from a building and not from a mast planted in the ground. Here it seems clearly to have been a desire to preserve his political sovereignty/sovereignty over the Isle that moved the Sheikh to make this distinction. And I believe that in Persian eyes a British flag planted on Persian soil is regarded as an attempt to assert some sort of political sovereignty, to keen alive a tradition of past usurpations, to perpetuate the spirit of the old relations between the two Govern ments in which scant regard was paid to Persian sovereign rights. The British flag is, if I am right, regarded here not so much as the innocent emblem of the British subjects’ nationality as an affront to Persian susceptibilities, which the present regime of national independence and con solidation has not yet had time to bury with the past con ditions which aroused them. It is the flag to which slaves have fled for protection and manumission - under which thousands of Persians have taken bast in refuge from their own authorities. Flown from the ground, the flag conjures up in the modern Persian pictures of all these humiliations, flown from the building, it could be tolerated - since the humiliation, if any, would be on the side ol the British authorities who may no longer plant it on i ersian soil. There it could be accepted as marking merely the nationality of the occupier, as in the case of other* national!ties round which such memories do not hover. Some such explanation is the only one which I can find to account for a demand which otherwise would seem too puerile even for such primitive mentality as the modern nationalist Persian. 9. Should it be considered that there are good reasons of policy for continuing the existing custom in respect of the flying of flags at the Imperial and International/International Communications Company's stations on the Persian Gulf coast, I venture to make the tentative sugges tion that, rather than abandon the custom, the Persian flag should be flown side by side with the Union Jack. This innovation might conceivably be welcomed, even by the Persians* as the international compliment which it in fact would constitute. It would mark the common interest which both States have in the public utility service rendered by the Imperial and International Communications Company, and, subject to the views of the rolitical Resident, I do not suppose that it would lower British prestige in the eyes of the Arabs to any appreciable extent. It seems to me to be a comoromise which might be suggested to the Persian Government should they become insistent in pressing their demands. 10. As for Consular flags, I am awaiting the reports from His Majesty's Consular Officers for which I have called. Until I receive them, I can hardly make recommen dations as to the oolicy to be adopted towards the demands of the Persian Government, supposing that Your lordship advises me that international law affords good grounds for resisting them. It may well be that in some Juris dictions His Majesty's Consular Officers may be of the opinion that compliance will mean a severe blow to British prestige, which every endeavour should be made to parry. Up to the present the Governor of Seistan is the only local authority reported to me as having made representations to His Majesty's Consular Officer under paragraph 4 of the CircularCircular of the Ministry of the Interior, a copy of which was enclosed in my despatch No.514 of September 21st. 11# The question has not yet been considered by the Diplomatic Corps as a body. For other countries, however, it has far less significance especially in the provinces. 12. I have ventured to write at what may perhaps seem excessive length upon this question. But the flag has always been an emblem to which the deepest sentiment attaches and any affront to it strongly resented. With my at present incomplete information on this many-sided problem, I prefer, as I have indicated above, not to make any recommendations as to the policy to be pursued, which might prove to be premature. The question cannot be considered in isolation or as merely formal. For the manner in which Eis Majesty's uovernment treat the lersian government's demands in respect of it may be taken by the latter as emblematic of all ^nglo-iersian relations and may have a beneficial or prejudicial influence on Persian sentiment in general. It may not be easy to combine a reasonable defence of the honour of the flag and a politic regard for Persian susceptibilities. 13.

British negation, G u 1 h e k September 21 et, 19 SI. My Lord Marquess, With reference to my despatch Ho. 419 of August 6th, regarding the flying of flags by the imperial and international Coraimnications Company, I hare the honour to transmit to Your Lordship, herewith, (a) a copy of a note, dated September 3rd, which I hare now received from the Minister for Foreiga Affairs, dealing not only with the flags of the Imperial and International Communications Company* but also with the flags of foreign diplomatic Missions and Consulates, and (b) a translation of a circular stated in the press of September 15th to have been sent on this subject to all local Persian authorities. The Persian Government claim that their regulations are based upon international usage and whether this is so or not, the issues raised in the notef( and circular appear to me to involve i iportant points of international law and custom^. 2. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, in his note, appears to lay down the following general rules for the flying of flags by foreigners in Persia : (1) Private persons and institutions may, on their own and Persian national holidays (provided the police see no objection) display their national 'flags on the front of their buildings, but may not hoist them on a vertical pole erected on the roof of the building. (2) Srabassies, Legations and Consulates rary hoist their national flags on vertical poles erected on the roofs of their buildings, but not on flagstaffs planted in the ground : it would. furthermore The Most Honourable The aarquess of Reading Cr.C.B., etc., etc., etc The Foreign Office.- 2 - furthermore, he in accordance with usual custom if the Embassies, Legations and Consulates restricted the flying of their flags to special occasions. 3. These rules are in general accordance with the terms of the circular. The difference between the w front n of a building and the ”vdiole M of a building is not of any import ance. In both cases the intention is doubtless that foreign flags may be hung from vdndows and balconies and even per haps from poles projecting outwards over doorways, but may not be hoisted on vertical poles over the buildings them selves (unless the buildings are tabasEies, Legations or Consulates). I am not sure how the Persian authorities will regard gateways when interpreting these regulations, but in view of the fact that in Persia few houses of any importance face directly on the street, I should think it probable that these will count as 'buildings”. I also think it probable, in spite of the wordijgg of Article 1 of the circular, that the Persian authorities do not intend to object to foreigner! flying flags on Persian holidays and on national days other than their own. 4. Tfith regard to the flying of flags by private persons and institutions, I presume that no objection can be taken to or at any rate no pretest raised against, the regulations of the Persian Gerernaent either us.regards the occasions on which flugs may be flown or the positions in which they may be displayed. I shall hovfever be glad to receive Your Lordship’s instructions on tills point. b. With regard to the use of f lagstaffs planted in the ground, I have already had the honour to request Your Lordship’s instructions in my despatch So. 419. The positioi '-g in Tehran is that all ISmbassids and Legations, except His {aaXc^L Majesty’s Legation, fly their flags from flagstaffs over A the*their houses or their gateways* His Majesty’s Represent- ative, moreover, flies his flag from a flagstaff over the gateway at the to n Legation, and it is only at Gulhek that the difficulty arises* Here the flagstaff, which formerly stood in public ground in front of the entrance, is now planted just inside the entrance* KYith regard to His Majesty’s Consulates, I sm not certain whether at any * posts besides Bus hi re (see paragraph 4 of n*y despatch Ho* 419) have flagstaffs planted in the ground, or, if so, whether any of these flagstaffs stand in ground which does not belong to the Consulate. I am asking Els Majesty’s Consular Officers to report upon this point* in the mean while I shall be glad to receive Your Lordship’s instruc tions as to the extent to which any demands made by the Persian Ooirernment for the removal of the flagataffs from the grounds of (a) Eis Majesty’s Legation at Gulhek and (b) any of His Majesty’s Consulates which may possess them, can, under international law and custom, be resisted* hen the flagstaff stands, as at Bushire, in ground not belong ing to the Consulate, it will, I presume, he necessary in the last resort to consent to their removal, at any rate into ground owned by the Consulate* At Bushire there are of course special considerations involved owing to the value of the flagstaff to international shipping. 6 * Viith regard to the occasions on which flags should be flown, it is the practice of all Legations in t g Tehran, including His Majesty’s Legation, and of His Majesty Consulates throughout Persia, to hoist their fla^s every day* I am aware that this is not the practice at many of-4- Hl 8 Majesty’s J^issions (compare Poreiga Office circular (T10005/9461/373) of September 15th f 1926), but the practice is of long standing in pereia. So far as Tehran is con cerned, I do not see any insuperable objection to the dis continuance of this practice, provided that it is discon tinued by all foreign missions simultaneously. At some of His Majesty’s Consulates, however, there may be special reasons wny any restriction on the occasions on which the flag is flown would b© undesirable. I am asking His Majesty's Consular Officers for their views, but in the meanwhile I should on this point again be glad to receive Your Lordship’s instructions as to the extent to which any demands made by the Persian Government for the restricted flying of flags at (a) His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran (or Gulhek) and (b) His j Jesty’s Consulates can, under international law and custom, be resisted. 7. I have not thought it necessary to ask for telegraphic instructions because of the intricacy of the question and of the fact that the regulations in the cir cular have not been communicated to me officially (though this is of minor importance in view of the note) and also because the terras of the circular suggest that the local authorities will not take precipitate action. I shall nonetheless be glad if I may receive Your Lordship’s instructions at the earliest possible date. 8 . Certain points of detail connected with the Imperial and International Communications Company’s flag staff at HenJam, which no doubt gave rise to the circular* as well/“N V' Sex', ^ Cmiutku*, . rjj i&gt; ; ! ^bj Idnd 3 &amp; as well as to the £iote 9 remain to be considered. With regard to the design of the flag which the Company are supposed to hare been flying, the Persian Government state that they are making further enquiries and no action is required for the moment. I shall, however, be gLud to learn whether, from the point of view of His lajesty’s Government, the Company are a private institution entitled only to fly the Union Jack, on a semi-public institution entitled to fly the blue, or even the red, T^nsiga. It is noticeable, in this connexion, that the Persian - ovem inent appear to be uncertain as to the designs of British. Consular flags and I propose at a suitable opportunity to communicate to the minister for Foreign Affairs a flag page from an old Foreign Office list* 9. So far as the position of the flagstaff at Hen^aa is concerned, I have already s sked for a report from the Acting political HesJd ent at ihishire. I am also asking Major Fowls to report whether the sharq Company in ushire fly the Boviet national flag from poles erected on the roofs of their offices and resib ential buildings, and whether they fly it every day (see the final paragraph of Bushire despatch Ho. 106/1567 of July &lt; bth, a copy ol which was enclosed in my despatch No. 419). In Tehran no flag is ordinarily flown by the Sharq company. It is of course possible that Soviet institutions, like other foreign institutions, will be required to comply with the new regulations. 10 I am sending a copy of this despatch, with Itsits enclosures, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and to His Majesty 1 s Consular Officers in Persia.

Monsieur le Charge d*Affaires, Your estenmed Note of Murdad 8th last (July 31st, 1931) No. 358 regarding the question of flying of flags by the (officials of the) International Comnnmi cat ions Company in Hen Jam was duly received. In reply, I have to call your attention to the following points 1. By the consulate flag mentioned in my note of Tir 9 1310 (July 1st, 1931) No. 11923 I meant the same British Govern ment flag as the Consular Institutions are hoisting on their buildings. As regards the statement you make to the effect that the officials of the Communications Company have neither been fly ing the Telegraph Department’s flag nor any consular flag, I have to state that the matter has again been referred to the competent authorities with a view to instituting further thor ough investigations into the matter, so that the real facts of the case may become known. 2. With regard to your statement to the effect that it seems that the above-mentioned institution has hitherto been flying the British blue flag ('Blue Fnsign' ) on Sundays and special holidays and the enquiry you make as to the regulations (practice ?) in force in Persia in this respect, I have the honour to inform you that in Persia foreiga subjects and institutions can, on their national holidays, fly their own national flags on the entrance of their houses (Facade de la maison') from morning till sunset should this not , in the opinionopinion of the local police, he against public order. The hoisting of a Government flag on a vertical flagstaff on a building is, however, exclusively reserved to foreign Legations and Consulates, who usually fly them on the occasion of Persian official festivals and the annual festivals of their respective countries, as well as on other holidays. But the hoisting of foreign flags on the ground is strictly forbidden. 3. As regards the place for hoisting a flag, I have to state that the object of my notes Nos. 11933 and 13594 was not to state that the hoisting of a flag on the entrance of a building is against international practice and arrange ments, but to point out the fact that in view of the report received to the effect that the flagstaff had been planted on the ground in the lane opposite the building, such an auction was, as stated above, irregular, and that foreign diplomatic representatives and Consulates have the right of flying flags only on the building of their respective institutions. I avail myself of this opportunity, etc., (Signed) Feiou^ii.Translation from the ^ran No«. 3611 of September 15^,1921. Hoisting of Fo r ol gn Flags in Persia* The following circular has been sent by the Ministry of the Interior ti all Governors-Greneral, Gorernors and sub- Governors : The following are the regulations governing the use by foreigners of the national flags in Persia on the lines of international usage, please see that they are strictly complied with Foreign nationals and institutions can hoist their national flags on the days of their national festivals from the morning till sunset on the whole of their buildings. Hoisting of Governmental flags on vertical flagstaffs over buildings is only the exclusive right of foreigi Legations and Consulates who do so usually on the days of official feasts of Persia and the annual festivals of their own country and on other days of festival. Hoisting of foreign flags on a flagstaff fixed on the ground is forbidden. Every foreign national or institution who fixes a flag on his or its building against the above regulations should be warned by the local Police Office that the above regulations are to be com plied with. If foreign Consulates hoist their flags against these regulations, the local Governor should approach the head of the Consular institution and discuss the matter with him and notify the result to the Ministry of the Interior in order that appropriate steps be taken by the latter. 1. 2. 3. 4.P.Z.5946/3I EHGLOSUHE III PGR El fin OPFIGE GGVSRI1JG LETTER No.E 4318/4318/34, DATED 17th SEPTEMBER, 1931. * 2 3 No.520.

Sir With reference to your despatch Wo.419, of the 6th August regarding the flying of flags by the officials of the Imperial and International Communications Company at telegraph stations on the Persian shore of the Persian Gulf, I have to inform you that you are correct in presuming that, in the absence of any regulation in Persian Law to the contrary, these officials are entitled to fly their national flag. 2. The proper flag for the purpose is the Union ' Jack, not the Red Ensigh. The latter was originally a naval flag, and was assigned by the Admiralty as the flag of the Mercantile Marine. It is not a shore flag, though at one time it was often supposed by ill-informed persons to be the appropriate flag for non-official Britidi subjects to fly, as a result of a misunderstanding as to the propriety of using the Union Jack, which was wrongly thought to be a purely official flag. 3. I am not aware of the existence of any written or unwritten ruling of international law or usage under which objection could be ta^n to the flying S Tindfi Wan. of/of flags on masts planted in the ground, as opposed to flags flown from roof-tops. It is true that in paragraph 2 of Chapter 4 of the General Consular Instructions, the consular flag is described as beig flown by consular officers orer their official residences. It is clear, however, that the word 'over' is not to be ta^en literally, since, if it were, the result would in many cases be to render the flying of the flag useless. The main purpose of flying the consular flag is to mark the whereabouts of His Majesty^ Consulate, and if this can only be achieved by flying the flag from a ground mast, no reasonable objection should arise. At several British missions abroad the flag is flown on a mast separate from the building. 4. In this country there is no officially recognised right to fly foreign flags, but in practice no objection is raised. The Union Jack may be flown by any British subject on land. I am, &amp;c., (Sgd.)

(E 4318/4318/34) British Residency &amp; Consulate-General. Bushire, the 26th July 1931. Sir, I have the honour to refer you to your despatch No. 119 dated the 7th July 1931 regarding a complaint received from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that the Officer-in-Charge of the telegraph station at Hen jam is in the hahit of flying the Consular flag. 2. I have now received a report hy telegram from the Manager at Karachi that not only do none of their stations fly the Consular flag, they do not even possess one. 3. It does appear, however, that it has been their custom to fly the blue ensign on Sundays and special holidays. The Manager informs me that he is now arranging to supply stations with a red ensign, and has given instructions that in the meantime the blue ensign should not be hoisted. I presume there is no objection to the Telegraph Stations flying the Red ensign. I do not know whether under the Persian regulation any restriction has been imposed on the flying of national flags, but in Bushire the Russian Sharq Company flies its national flag (red with the sickle and hammer) over both its office and residental buildings.
