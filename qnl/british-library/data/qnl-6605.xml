The Constitutional Struggle, TOWARDS the end of his report on the situation in Persia for 1907 Mr. Marling described the Shah’s premature coup d'etat against the Medjliss and His Majesty’s failure to make use of his opportunity of becoming master of the situation. Indeed the effect of the situation had been to draw the Nationalists closer together, the deposition of the Shah had been openly mooted, and, terrified for his safety, His Majesty bad opened negotiations for a reconciliation, and on the 20th December had accepted the conditions of the Assembly. The beginning of 1908 saw no improve ment in the state of affairs. Popular feeling was by no means satisfied by the Shah s concessions. On the contrary, the general mistrust continued to increase. About the middle of January, Azad-ul-Mulk, the head of the Kajar tribe and the Shoa-es-Sultanah exposed to the Shah the dangers of the situation. The former, using his patriarchal authority, spoke openly, saying that he knew that His Majesty was himself responsible for the lamentable state of the country, and informed him that the Kajars themselves would join with the nation to depose him in favour of the Valiahd, unless he gave signal proof that for the future he intended to co-operate with the Assembly. On the 15th January Mr. Marling was received, and frankly exposed to His Majesty the dangers of the situation. The Shah’s reply was to effect that he had no quarrel with the present Assembly. A show of conciliation was, indeed, made the next day, but there appeared no more reason than on previous occasions to believe in the sincerity of His Majesty's professions. The position of affairs still continued to remain as precarious as ever and the Minister for Foreign Affairs even went so far as to hint at the possibility of a Regency, mentioning the name of Zil-es-Sultan in this connection. Matters, however, failed to come to a head. Dissensions, probably fomented by the Shah himself, made their appearance in the Assembly, charges of peculation were bandied about, and the general discord prevented any united action being taken. During the next month the Shah abstained from any overt interference in the affairs of the country. The evacuation by the Turkish troops of Soujboulak was even made the excuse for the exchange of flattering messages between the Shah and [347] B2 the Assembly. • Still public opinion was by no means quieted by these outward demonstrations of courtesy, and rumours of an impending coup d'etat continued to be current. Meanwhile the scenes of strife which had lately been of frequent occurrence awoke in the Assembly the sense of inefficiency. In order to still the growing outer* and to meet the general demand for an improvement, the Chamber undertook thu duty of itself selecting members to fill vacancies caused by death or resignation. This act indeed was not in itself contrary to the provisions of the Constitution, but it was, to say the least, in the circumstances a step attended with some risk. Unfortunately, it failed in its object. The public proceedings of the Assembly gradually became more and more formal, and all real business began to be transacted either in secret session or in private meetings of the various committees of the House. At the end of February a reconstruction of the Ministry took place. Nizam-es-Sultaneh was accepted by the Chamber as Prime Minister, in the hope that, though never considered as being at heart a constitutionalist, his experience and power of managing men, would enable him to some extent to restore order in the country. The Ministry of Finance was taken over by Sani-ed-Dowleh, who was supposed to possess compara tively liberal ideas. The composition of the remainder of the Cabinet was otherwise generally colourless but not actually unpromising. On the 28th February a determined attempt on the Shah’s life took place, and His Majesty narrowly escaped death. Rumour connected the attempt with various individuals, such as Zil-es-Sultan, the members of the Tabrecz Anjuman and even with M. Chapchal, the Shah’s late notorious tutor. The cheers of the populace greeted His Majesty immediately after his escape and sympathetic utterances were generally expressed by the Press. It w T ould seem, however, that the general feeling in the capital, as also in many places in the provinces, was rather one of regret that the attempt had failed. Although the provocation was great, and he was pressed by his reactionary advisers to take energetic measures to discover his would-be assassins, the Shah remained passive. He confined himself to urging on the assembly the necessity of making a thorough investigation to discover the authors of the plot. It was scarcely to be expected that His Majesty’s action was taken out of regard for the Assembly. From his point of view he was probably pursuing the wiser course, hoping that the assembly, which was daily becoming more discredited with the nation, would either die a natural death or suddenly commit an act of political suicide. Ultimately some arrests were made, but it was generally believed that the two men most responsible for the plot were allowed to escape, and no trial of the rest took place. As time went on, it became evident that the Ministers, by their hesitating attitude and by their laissez-faire tactics, were steadily allowing the power of the Assembly to pass into the hands of the political clubs. There were signs that the real struggle was no longer between the Shah and the Medjliss, but between His Majesty and the Anjumans. Early in April the first round in the encounter took place. The point at issue was whether the Governor of Tehran and the chief of the police, by arresting some alleged authors of the attempt on the Shah's life, without the warrant of the Minister of Justice, had acted unconstitutionally or not. Seeing that the matter so nearly concerned the Shah, the Anjumans might have overlooked the irregularity, but, in their anxiety to prevent any infringement of the people’s newly-won liberties, they insisted on bringing matters to an issue. Members of the Anjumans crowded to the Assembly and the courts of justice, demanding the trial of the Governor of Tehran and the chief of police. The Shah refused to allow the trial, and censured the Prime Minister for allowing matters to come to such a pass. The whole Cabinet thereupon resigned. A compromise was finally arranged, and it was agreed that the Cabinet should retain office, and that the two offending officials should be tried by the Ministry of War in the presence of the Cabinet and of representatives of the Assembly and the A njumans. The trial took place, and both w r ere eventually found guilty of violating the Con stitution, and nominal sentences were passed on them. The Anjumans thus got the better of the Shah in this trial of strength. Seeing the personal nature of the question raised, His Majesty w as naturally exasperated at his defeat, and began to show himself more openly hostile to the constitutional regime. Early in May, in connection with the alarmist rumours regarding the situation which had reached the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Marling reported that the Shah’s unpopularity had certainly increased of late, and that the Anjumans were considering the question of summoning a meeting to discuss his deposition. The meeting did not, however, take place, and the usual reconciliation w ith the Chamber followed. Mr. Marling thought that though the assassination of the Shah was always possible, yet there was no special reason to3 apprehend immediate danger. Daring the next four weeks, indeed, the general situation was quieter than of late. A feeling of depression was, however, beginning to spread among the people. It was becoming recognised by the more intelligent classes that the machinery of government was dislocated, and that, under a feeble dministration, the general condition of the country was going from bad to worse, in May the Ministry twice resigned. The averred reason for the first resignation was the alleged hostility of His Majesty’s Legation to certain budget proposals of Sani-ed- Dowleh, the Minister of Finance. As a matter of fact, they resigned on account of internal dissensions. After a reconstruction of the Cabinet they resigned again a fortnight later, and the Prime Minister, Nizam-es-Sultaneh, who, owing to his venality and unconstitutional methods, had become exceedingly unpopular, fled from Tehran. Financial difficulties, too, began to be pressing, and both Mr. Marlins: and M. de Hartwig, the Russian Minister, both believed that the straits of the Government were such they would he shortly compelled to appeal to the two neighbouring Powers for assistance. About this time the Shah invited Kasr-ul-Mulk to return to Persia, The object of this move was not quite clear; it was probably only an expedient to gain temporary popularity, and to enable His Majesty to get safely out of the capital to one of his country seats. During the last half of May the country remained without a Cabinet, and efforts to form one were hampered by the excitement caused by the Russian ultimatum over the Beliasuvar frontier affair. Owing to the want of courage on the part of the Ministry the question, w r hich formed one of a series of frontier incidents, had never been properly placed before either the Medjliss or the public, and, though the rumour was spread and gained credence that the Shah himself had authorised the entry of the Russian troops to impose the ultimatum, no Minister was found with courage enough to contradict these stories to His Majesty’s discredit. Popular anger was diverted from Russia and became directed against the Shah. A formidable agitation was set on foot against His Majesty. The demand was put forward that certain persons in his service such as Amir Bahadur Jang, the chief of his body-guard, M. Chapchal and other favourites at Court should be dismissed. The influence of the two former over the Shah was indeed notoriously evil, and the demand for their removal was not in itself unreasonable, and had been put forward already on several occasions. The friends of the Zil-es-Sultan supported the agitation, and his son, Jelal-ed-Dowleh, was certainly deeply involved in the movement, though it was alleged on his behalf that the Anjumans were exercising intimidation upon him and the other Kajar princes with a view to bringing pressure to bear on the Shah. On the 2nd June, the Shah yielded, and six of the most detested of his entourage were dismissed. M. de Hartwig on the following day came to see Mr. Marling, and expressed the greatest anxiety for the Shah’s safety. It was agreed that they should both see the Foreign Minister and give him a serious warning of the dangers into which the country was gradually drifting, and of the necessity of maintaining the dynasty by endeavouring to bring about a better state of feeling between the Shah and his people. The interview took place and Mushir-ed-Dowleh, who had resigned only a few days before but was still acting at the Ministry, promised to convey to his colleagues and the Assembly the warning and advice given by the two representatives. Mr. Marling was not, however, sanguine as to the effect of these counsels, apprehending that instead of bringing about concord, the interview would only increase the Shah’s unpopularity by strengthening the widespread belief that His Majesty was being supported by Russia. In June events began to move more rapidly. Early on the morning of the 4th a simulated riot was engineered in a remote part of Tehran; Cossacks were sent galloping through the town in every direction, and in the confusion caused by this diversion, the Shah left the Palace, and surrounded by a strong guard of Cossacks, drove to a garden to the west of the city. Though great excitement and considerable uneasiness prevailed as to what would next happen, Tehran remained quiet. The Shah’s personal safety now seemed more assured, and M. de Hartwig expressed to Mr. Marling his pleasure at what had happened. On the 7 th June the Ministry was re-constituted, with Mushir-es-Sultaneh as Premier, and on the same day Jelal-ed- Dowleh, Ala-ed-Dowleh and Sardar Mansur, who were suspected of complicity with the Anjumans, were summoned to the Palace and arrested. Another period of negotiation followed, and the Anjumans appeared to be hesitating as to the wisdom of continuing the struggle. Active resistance was finally decided on, and on the 10 th June armed bodies of the Anjumans again began to collect at the Siparsalar mosque, their old meeting place adjoining the Medjliss. At Bagh-i-Shah, which was strongly guarded, the Shah seemed irresolute. On the one side His Majesty was4 demanding: the arrest and trial of the most prominent of the popular leaders, while on the other the Anjumans were asking for the public trial of Ala-ed-Dowleh and his two companions. Two days later, however, the Shah appears to have taken courage, and sent a rescript by the hand of a Russian officer, accompanied by thirty Cossacks, to the Assembly and Ministers with the order that unless the gathering at the Mosqu*' dispersed, it would be compelled to do so by force. The threat was sufficient. Aftei a short debate with closed doors a deputation of the Assembly, headed by the President, proceeded to the Mosque and urged the people to go to their homes. The appeal was obeyed in silence, but there was deep depression on the popular side who felt that the Medjliss had betrayed the cause. The leaders of the national movement now began to consider how to cany on the struggle by peaceable and constitutional means. The Shah, however, on his part, encouraged by the success of his threat to use force, appeared to have hardened his heart and prepared to take extreme measures. Steps were taken to secure the loyalty of the Cossack brigade, a further force Tvas recruited from among the lower classes of the town, and Bagh-i-Shah was converted into an armed camp. The chiefs of the popular party finally decided on their course of action. A deputation of six members of the Medjliss were to be received by the Shah and were to present a memorial recalling the various oaths His Majesty had taken to observe the constitution, and calling upon him to work with the assembly. When he eventually received the deputation, the Shah merely replied that he could give no definite answer at the moment, but he reminded his auditors that the Kajars had taken Persia by the sword, and that he meant to hold it by the sword. The situation now became more strained. Telegrams denouncing the Shah and offering armed support to the popular cause flowed in from all parts of the country, and the Ministry appeared unable to influence the Shah or to persuade him of the danger he was running by pursuing his present course. All this time Zil-es-Sultan was playing a cautious game at Shiraz, where he had, in March, gone as governor. Certainly he w’as being thought of by many as a candidate for the Throne in the event of the Shah’s deposition, and his name was being made use of by the Shah’s opponents. Bis Imperial Highness recognised that not only had he to calculate with the active enmity of the Russian Legation but also the opposition of His Majesty’s Legation who were acting in perfect loyalty to the Shah. Rumour, which Mr. Marling subsequently thought to be well-founded, said that he was assisting the Anjumans with large sums of money, but outwardly he confined himself to making professions of loyalty to the constitution, professions which his previous career as governor in the provinces made it difficult to believe in. On the 18th June and on the two following days negotiations constantly went on between the Ministers and the Assembly on the one hand and the Court at Bagh-i-Shah on the other. The Anjumans appeared to be regaining courage, and the Assembly were endeavouring to exercise a restraining influence, in order to afford the Shah no excuse to take forcible measures. The Ministers finally consented to surrender to the Shah some eight or ten persons, who had been particularly violent in their attacks on His Majesty. On the 20th the debate on this arrangement took place, excited scenes occured, the Ministers were denounced as traitors and the Shah’s demands were rejected. His Majesty was evidently prepared for this eventuality. Early in the morning of the 23rd June Colonel Liakhoff, the commander of the Cossack Brigade, took possession of the Siparsalar Mosque with 300 Cossacks and two guns. Seyyid Abdullah, a prominent Mullah and Nationalist leader, accompanied by some 2,000 armed members of the Anjumans, came up during the Colonel’s absence and succeeded in persuading the Cossacks to leave the Mosque. On his return, finding the Mosque abandoned, Colonel Ltakhoff posted six guns and Cossacks round the approaches to the Assembly. He then proceeded to Bagh-i-Shah to inform the Shah of his action, and according to his own account, advised His Majesty to wait for the surrender of the Anjumans whoso position he considered, from a military point of view, untenable. In the meanwhile the first shots had been fired—by w hom it was never proved, but it is more than probable that some of the Nationalists occupying the adjacent houses were the culprits. On his return to the square in front of the Medjliss, the Colonel found his men taking cover. He ordered a volley to be fired in the air. This was answered by rifle shots on every side. The Cossacks were then ordered to open fire with the guns. At first the brigade suffered severely, and more than ouce were driven from the guns. Bombs were thrown by the Anjumans and the artillery replied with shrapnel. Heavy fighting ensued, but finally the Assembly and the Mosque were cleared of their defenders. By the afternoon the Shah’s triumph was complete. The Assembly, the Zil’s palace andone or two other buildings marked out for systematic looting, were plundered, but the Cossacks were kept well in hand and undoubtedly they prevented the Shah’s irregulars from committing worse excesses. In the course of the fight five Persian officers and eighteen men of the Cossack Brigade were killed, six Persian officers and thirty men Tv &gt; re wounded, and the other regiments lost some 320 killed and wounded. On Cie Nationalist’s side it was officially stated that 500 were killed, hut the actual loss probably little exceeded half of this figure. The victory was subsequently celebrated by a distribution of medals amonsr the Shah’s troops. During the course of that afternoon a considerable number of arrests was made among all classes of the population, and every effort was used to secure the leaders ol the Nationalist party, the chiefs of the Anjumans and the best known editors of newspapers. Tehran itself seemed to be stunned and considerable terror reigned owing to reports that prisoners were being put to death wholesale at Bagh-i-Shah. As a matter of fact two executions had actually taken place. Some fifty persons, including Taki Zadeh, the famous Nationalist leader and orator, took “ bast” in His Majesty’s Legation, but Mr. Marling did his best to prevent the Legation being used as an asylum by political refugees. Martial law was declared, and the policing of the town was entrusted to Colonel Liakhoff and the Cossack brigade. A proclamation, dated the 22nd June, indeed announced that that officer had been appointed Governor- General of Tehran, and, though M. de Hartwig made explanations and endeavoured to minimise the Colonel’s powers, yet undoubtedly for some days he was de facto Governor of the town. The Shah’s triumph was, it must be admitted, accompanied by singularly few acts of vengeance. It is true a number of arrests were made, and an active search for arms took place, but, otherwise, considering the circumstances, His Majesty used his. victory with moderation. On the evening of the 23rd June the Russian and British dragomans were received in audience by the Shah, and His Majesty gave assurances as to the safety of foreigners. He said he intended to observe the constitution he had given to his people. It is only just to remark that during that day and subsequently, Europeans were in no way molested, and the town was quieter than it had been for some months previously. On the 27th June, a general amnesty was proclaimed. The announcement was received with mistrust, •which was subsequently shown not to he unjustified, as a certain number of arrests took place in the next few days. About the 2nd July, a further proclamation was issued, dated the 24th June, announcing the dissolution of the Assembly and ordering new elections. On the 8 th July, a rescript of the Shah was sent to the Prime Minister instructing the Cabinet to concert measures of reform. The events of the next months showed how far the Shah was sincere in his intentions. The part played by Tabreez during the struggles of 1908 must not be lost sight of. This great commercial centre had, from the first, been one of the chief strongholds of the Nationalist movement. The Tabreez Anjuman in Tehran was one of the foremost of these organisations, and, when troublous times seemed to be approaching, the city itself sent a large armed contingent to the capital. With the news of the Ixmibardment of the Medjliss 'Tabreez became greatly disturbed, the bazaars were closed and fighting took place between the Shah’s partisans and the Constitutionalists. Negotiations ensued in which the Russian Consul-General took a prominent part, and the Nationalists ultimately agreed to allow Royalist cavalry to enter the town to maintain order. The Shah’s adherents then began to loot, the Nationalists reassembled their forces and the fighting recommenced, with the result that the Royalists were expelled from the city. In the beginning of August troops under Ain-ed-Dowleh, w r ere dispatched from Tehran and regular seige operations commenced. The defence of the city under the direction of Sattar Khan, a horse -dealer by trade, is perhaps the most creditable episode of last year’s struggle. Though the Royalists troops were increased until they numbered some 4,000 men, besides irregulars, and in spite of the fact that the great extent of ground covered by the town rendered the defence a very difficult task, the Nationalists succeeded in holding out until April of the next year, and within the city itself they behaved well and maintained, on the whole, excellent order. The value of the example of the “ stalwarts ” of the north-west to the Constitutional party in other parts of Persia was incalculable, and had it not been for the nine months resistance of Tabreez to the Royalist forces, the popular movement in the country would probably, for a time have been completely arrested. In the other provinces except perhaps at Resht and Ispahan the fate of the Medjliss was regarded with indifference. At Court there appeared to be no fixed [347] • Cpolicy; the Shah at one moment inclined to clemency and the next moment was all for severity. He was making no attempt either to re-establish order by the old-fashioned methods of absolutism or to govern nominally as a constitutional ruler under a regime which he now had the power to shape as lie liked. Either of these two alternatives would have been, in all probability, temporarily successful as Nationalists were stunned, and their only idea of action appeared to be to ta?§ “ bast ’ J at the foreign Legations. As time went on the gravity of the general situation appeared in no way to be deereasiner, and on the 19th August the Acting Russian Minister for Foreign Ai r airs suggested to His Majesty’s Ambassador that it would be well that the Shah should be reminded by both Powers of the promises made in his manifesto of July, and of the necessity of convoking the Assembly. M. Tcharykoff was told in reply that His Majesty’s Government were disposed to agree that a message, such as that proposed, should be conveyed to the Shah, and it w T as suggested that M. Tcharykoff himself should draft the form of the communication. The time to deliver it was to he left to the judgment of the representatives on the spot. M. Tcharykotf answered that he agreed; his object was to strengthen the Shah’s hands against the reactionary elements that surrounded him ; His Majesty was, he thought, really desirous of convoking the Assembly and of observing the constitution, but had strong forces to combat. An identic communication was accordingly drawn up, stating that “ as the intention of His Majesty the Shah of shortly making public the new regulations in regard to the coming legislative elections had been made known by His Majesty, it is considered by the Russian Minister (British Chargd d’Affaires) in accordance with instructions received by his Government and with no wish of any kind to interfere in Persian internal affairs, that, in the interests of general prosperity and trade, and of the definite pacification of the country, it would be most desirable and opportune that His Majesty the Shall should, at the same time, be pleased to make the announcement that his decision in regard to the maintenance of the organic laws which had been granted by him to the Empire, is irrevocable, and that on the 14th November the Assembly, which is about to be created, will meet in Tehran.” On the 2nd September Sir E. Grey informed the Russian Government that the moment appeared to have come for making the joint representation, and on the 8 th September the identic communication, in the form of a joint memorandum, was handed to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs for submission to the Shah. His Majesty’s reply was received on the 19th September. Its tone was unsatisfactory. It stated that the necessary steps were being taken to form a Medjliss “ in accordance with the country’s wants, and with religion, and in order that disorders should not recur.” His Majesty was in hopes of being able to issue a proclamation for the convocation of the Medjliss on the date mentioned by the Russian and British Governments, but “ until order had been restored in Tabreez, when the Persian Government will have time to make the necessary arrangements, the Medjliss would not open.” No mention was made of the organic law r s, and in spite of the advice of the two Governments to take conciliatory steps at Tabreez, the Shah had just lately permitted the Maku Kurds to attack the town. Subsequently at different audiences the Shah expressed both to M. de Hartvi ig and to Mr. Marling his great desire for reforms, and averred that it was intended that the new electoral law should be promulgated in the near future. On the 2nd October a rescript drawn up in somewhat obscure terms w as published. It seemed to sliow r that there was an intention of re-modelling the old constitution. An electoral law T was to be published on the 27th October; Parliament wets to be convoked on the 14th November, and mention was made, without giving particulars, of two chambers. But until the restoration of order at Tabreez, no elections were to be held there. The 27th October passed, and no electoral law had been published. The public mistrust in the Shah’s promises, and the general belief in his want of sincerity again appeared to be justified. The attitude of M. de Hartwig at this time is being treated under another heading. It is sufficient to say here that it w r as the general belief in Tehran that the Russian Minister was greatly responsible for the Shah’s unsatisfactory attitude as regards the joint communication. Early in November, at the instigation of His Majesty’s reactionary followers, and in order to provide a pretext for asserting that the constitution was opposed to the popular will, two bosrus petitions were presented to the Shah praying that a constitutional government should not be granted. The Shah immediately took steps to carry out the petitioners’washes. M. de Hartw ig and Sir G. Barclay, w ho had arrived in Tehran on the 1 st October pointed out that these petitions did not represent the true feelings of the nation, and on the 8 th November a further identic memorandum was presented to the Shah in which the7 t moment was all for by the old-fashioned ional ruler under a Either of these two successful as thg ?ared to be to tai/j ired in no way to he * for Foreign AFairs hat the Shah should festo of J uly, and of )ld in reply that His ich as that proposed, .

But eld there. The 27th le public mistrust in ty again appeared to being treated under ?ral belief in Tehran hah’s unsatisfactory er, at the instigation pretext for asserting isrus petitions were muld not be granted. ies. M. de Hartwig &gt;ber pointed out that on, and on the 8 th e Shah in which the hope was expressed that His Majesty would fulfil his promises without loss of time. But neither did this representation have any effect. The reply was a rescript, published on the 22nd November, stating that the idea of convoking a Medjliss had. been abandoned, as the Ulema had declared that such an assembly was contrary to the teachings of Islam. The tone of this document was uncompromising, and it meant that the Shah refused to grant an elective assembly of any kind. A further joint memorandum was accordingly presented on the same day expressing surprise at the Shah’s decision and at this breach of his promises. Early in November the question had already been raised as to the expediency of conveying: an intimation to the Shah that the Russian officers of the Cossack Brigade would be withdrawn in the event of His Majesty continuing to disregard the advice of the two Powers. M. Isvolsky discountenanced the idea as not being in accordance with the avowed policy of the two Governments of non-intervention. The Shah and his people should, be thought, be left to settle their differences without outside interference. On the 28th November the Shah received the dragomans of the two Legations and again repeated that he had no intention of abandoning all idea of a Parliament, and two days later a note was received from the Foreign Minister stating that His Majesty intended to grant an Assembly suited to the habits of the people and in accordance with the laws of Islam. The note laid stress on the disorders that had taken place under the constitutional regime, when the form of Assembly was not suited to the people. Aflairs at Tabreez had, meanwhile, raised the question of foreign intervention. The disabilities that had been imposed against that city had already formed the subject of representations on the part of the two Legations. On the 19th October, the situation appeared critical and it was feared that, in consequence of the great distress, the populace of the besieged city might, in desperation, mob the Consulates and molest foreigners. The following day, however, the Nationalists gained a victory and compelled the Royalists to evacuate the town, and a reassuring telegram was sent to the Legations by the Tabreez Anjumans assuring them of the goodwill felt towards foreigners by the Nationalists. Matters, however, seemed to be in reality but little better, and on the 17th October, M. Tcharykoff informed Sir A. Nicolson that it had been decided to send a small force to Tabreez to protect Russian subjects and the various Russian institutions. M. Teharykoff added that he trusted that this action would not be misunderstood, saying that there was no intention to intervene in Persia nor to crush the ft ationalists nor to support the Shah. Three days later, how ever, the news received was more satisfactory, and the forces were ordered to remain at Julfa, and on the 2 nd November, M. Isvolsky assured Sir A. fticoison that, should any movement of troops he necessary, previous intimation would he given. The following day the Ambassador was received in audience by the Emperor, who repeated that he was determined to carry out loyally the provisions of the Anglo-Russian Convention. Though in Tahreez itself the Nationalists were successful in keeping order, the state of the Julfa road still continued insecure, owing to the action of the irregulars composing part of the Shah’s forces, and both Sir G. Barclay and M. de Hartwig made strong representations on the subject. On the 17th November M. Isvolsky pointed out to Sir A. Nicolson the great difficulty he was experiencing in resisting the appeals that were being made to him for some protection to Russian interests in Azerbaijan, and ten days later he repeated that great pressure was being brought to bear on him, stating that the claims of Russian subjects already amounted to 150,000/. He also pointed out that the insurrectionary movement was being encouraged by the Young Turk Committee. Representations were made at Constanti nople, and a Veply was received to the effect that the Turkish Consul-General at Tabreez and the authorities at Van had been instructed to abstain from any inter ference with internal affairs in Persia. Subsequently further representations were made and it was plainly hinted that it would he difficult to prevent Russian inter vention in Azerbaijan, if it were found that other foreign influences were at work supporting the Nationalists. At the beginning of December there seemed to be indications of a revival of the constitutional movement; secret societies again commenced to work, and riots in favour of the constitution broke out at Astrabad and Meshed. At the latter place the movement seemed due to the influence of the priesthood ; the people of Khorassan declared that they were ready to follow' their spiritual leaders to the end. A few days later it was announced that the Shah had decided to institute a grand council. This body, as stated by the rescript, w'as to consist of some fifty members, “ experiencedift affairs of state,” some of whom were to he selected by the Sovereign and others elected by the people. However, when the regulations for the new council appeared, there was no mention of the question of election. The financial difficulties of the Court were now becoming serious. On the 17th December, the Shah sent Saad-ed-Dowdeh to interview' Sir G. Barclay and M. Sabline, who had assumed charge of the Russian Legation on M. Hartwig’s departure in the middle of November, and to enquire w hether the two Governments would make an advance of 400,000/. if the constitution was granted. Sir G. Barclay replied that His Majesty might be informed that except under a constitutional regime there would be no chance of any such assistance being granted. Moreover, the constitutional regime would have to be actually in working, and not merely on paper, and satisfactory guarantees would have to be given that the money advanced would be properly expended. At the end of the year it looked as if the Shah was wavering and was inclined to yield. His Majesty was, however, evidently again very nervous regarding his personal safety under a parliamentary system, and on the 22nd December asked whether the British and Russian Legations would give him guarantees if their advice was followed. Accordingly the two dragomans were instructed to inform His Majesty that ‘‘ his person would be protected in case of necessity, and should he seek protection, and that lie would have the sympathy and support of the two Legations so long as he governed as a constitutional Sovereign.’’ At the end of the year it looked as if financial pressure might induce the Shah again to try to play the part of a constitutional ruler. The events of the subsequent months were to demonstrate still more clearly the seemingly ingrained inability of His Majesty to carry out his promise's. It cannot be said that the constitutional struggle in Persia during the year T908 reflects greatly to the credit of either side. There is little doubt that the Medjliss during the last six months of its existence steadily lost the support of the nation, and excited the mistrust even of those who had, in the first year of its life, been its ardent admirers. The honesty of many of its members had become suspect, it had tended more and more to sink to the level of a caucus of dubious methods, and its proceedings had rudely shaken the faith of the public in their newly- acquired privileges. It is not unlikely that, but for its violent end, it would have died a death of natural inanition, unmourned except by a small section of enthusiasts in the capital. Except at Tabreez there was little display of that personal courage necessary for the support of a great national movement. There w r ere few wdio show r ed any disposition to offer themselves as martyrs to the cause. In excuse for this faintheartedness of many it must be said that the abolition of absolutism in Persia was still a very recent event, so that, at the bottom of their hearts, there were but few among the Nationalists wTio felt strong enough to fight out the issue with an autocratic system, which had deeply left its mark on the character of a naturally somewhat timid people. The conception of a constitution among the more stalwart consisted in losing no opportunity of attacking the remaining fabric of autocracy, rather than in training and educating the masses regarding the liberties and duties of the subject. The constructive element among the deputies was conspicuously absent. As regards the Ministers themselves, who, under the Constitution, had to be nominated by the Shah, it is certain that many of them, even with the best intentions, could not divest themselves of the traditional idea that they w 7 ere hut the agents and servants of the Crown, and they seemed never to lose sight of the penalties that might befall them if they incurred an autocrat’s displeasure. The field for intrigue offered by ail these elements w r as too promising not to be taken advantage of by the Court. There is now little doubt that many of the most violent among the leaders of the Anjumans w^ere mere agents provocateurs in the Shah’s pay. This was only realised after the destruction of the Medjliss, when many who had been the most violent of the Shcah's assailants were allowed to escape unpunished, while others, apparently more innocent, were arrested. The loss of confidence in themselves thus produced in the ranks of the Nationalists will, to some extent, account for the collapse of the party during the next succeeding months. Of the Shah and his courtiers there is even less to be said. Throughout his dealing's w ith the Medjliss His Majesty has pursued an ineffective course of short sightedness and duplicity, while a lack of moral courage has prevented him carrying through to his own advantage acts to which he had been driven by a temporary sense of fear. No further proof is required of His Majesty’s incapacity as ruler beyond the fact that, during his six months of absolutism during the latter halfof the year, no attempt was made to re-introduce the old system of administration, which, wholly bad as it was, would very likely, for a time at least, have satisfied many classes in Persia, who had temporarily forgotten the hard times and oppression of Mohammed Ali Shah*s two predecessors. It says much for the generally peaceable character of the Persian people that, uuring 1908, disorder was not more wide-spread in the country than was actually the case. It has always been upon ’the powers of the provincial governors that the security of life and property has principally depended. The local administration during* the whole of the year was of the feeblest description. Nevertheless, the depredations committed by the wild tribes living near the chief trade arteries were much less than might have been expected, and the general losses to commerce were smaller than might have been anticipated. To the credit of the Nationalists it must also be noted that they did their utmost to discourage any fanaticism or hostile feeling against foreigners. On the other hand it is true that the Medjliss itself did much to create a feeling of “ Persia for the Persians,” and, accordingly, many of its harshest critics and opponents of the assembly are to be found among the Europeans living in the country. But, whatever may be said, it should at least be recognised that foreign lives and property probably never enjoyed greater security in Persia than in 1908. The Russian Legation and Russian Officers in Persia. In the yearly report for 1907 Mr. Marling called attention to the part played by the Russian Legation at Tehran in Persian internal affairs, and to its partisan activity in favour of the Shah. He also enumerated instances in which the Russian Legation and Russian officers in other parts of Persia had behaved in a manner which cannot be described as being in accordance with the spirit of the Anglo-Russian Convention. It was, indeed, not to be expected that Russian agents, brought up under the Asiatic Department, should suddenly be able to break away from its traditions, and M. de Hartwig was a capable and hard-working official of this school. He was one of those who considered at the time of the signature of the Convention, that his country was being deprived of the ripe fruit which was ready to fall into her lap, and he seems to have thought that the only way in which the results of Russian diplomacy of past years were to be secured was in the retention, at all costs, on the throne of Mohammed Aii Shah, who, as Yaliahd at Tabreez, had shown himself thoroughly amenable. He was greatly aided in his independent policy by his wife, a lady of great force of character, who was generally believed to be in close touch with grand ducal circles in St. Petersburg, and was thoroughly imbued with absolutist convictions. There is little doubt that the obstinate opposition steadily shown by the Shah, after the departure of M, de Hartwig, towards any constitutional concessions, may he traced to the visits of this lady to the palace, which, as a rule, were subsequently marked by some fresh display of recalcitrancy on His Majesty’s part. Given M. de Hartwig’s character and ambitions, it soon became clear, as the constitutional struggle between the Shah and his people grew more acute, that the Russian Legation would not be able to play the part of impartial spectators. Circumstances were, indeed, in his favour. After the abortive coup d’fitat of December, 1907, when the position of the Shah was said to be critical, it was felt both by M. de Hartwig and Mr. Marling that the only course open at the moment was to use every effort to maintain His Majesty on the throne; and, throughout the remainder of his stay in Tehran, the Russian Minister continued to pursue an active policy on these lines. It is somewhat curious that in spite of his astuteness, M. de Hartwig was never able to gauge the extent to which the active support of Russia was steadily damaging the Shah in the eyes of his people. Various minor incidents, such as the introduction into Tabreez of extra Cossack guards, and certain murder cases, in which Russian subjects were implicated, had been contributing to the unpopularity of Russia. In the beginning of February there occurred the attempted assassination of the Shah, and the part now generally known to have been played by the Russian Legation in assisting the escape out of the country of those suspected of complicity in the plot, gave rise to the idea that the whole business had been engineered by Russian agents in order to discredit the Constitutional party. So, too, Russophobia was further stimulated by the Beliasuvar frontier incident and the ultimatum addressed by Russia to the Persian Government, which were construed as attempts on the Shah’s part to bring about the introduction of Russian troops into Persia. M. de Hartwig appears, however, to have thought that the steadily rising [317] ~feeling against Russia could be ignored. Between the abortive coup d'Etat and the destruction of the Medjliss in June his advice and efforts were directed, not to trying to effect any reconciliation between the Sovereign and the assembly, but merely towards strengthening the material forces upon which His Majesty’s throne depended. By the month of June it became evident that these efforts were a failure, and M. Hartwig then tried to convince his government that a policy of non-intervention on the part of the two legations was proving fatal to the Shah, and was favouring the pretensions to the throne of Zil-es-Sultan, whose accession would be regarded as a triumph of British as opposed to Russian diplomacy. He suggested to his govern ment that he should be empowered to inform the Persian Government and the Medjliss that the two Powers were pledged to maintain the existing dynasty, and he complained that the neutral, or, as he termed it, the “detached” attitude and indifference of Mr. Marling towards the Shah and his difficulties, could only have the effect of promoting the Zil’s cause. During the crisis which preceded the destruction of the Medjliss the attitude of the Russian Minister became still more clearly defined, and the events of the 23rd June showed how far his policy differed from the avowed intention of his government not to interfere in Persian internal affairs. It would now T seem that though the details may not have been actually arranged by M. de Hartwug, yet the destruction of the Medjliss was carried out with its full knowdedge and consent. He certainly endeavoured on the 23rd June to delay, as long as possible, making any representations to the Shah, in order that nothing should occur which might interfere with the thorough execution of the work. As, however, was the case with the coup d'Etat of the previous December, the Shah’s victory was incomplete. The attempt to secure the leaders of the movement failed, being to a certain extent frustrated by a number of the Nationalists taking “ bast ” in His Majesty’s Legation, although admission w T as only granted in cases where there was good reason for thinking that their lives were in imminent danger. M. de Hartwig’s disappointment at the obstacle which now arose in the way of the thorough execution of his scheme to re-establish the Shah as an absolute monarch, then vented itself on His Majesty’s Legation. Mr. Marling and certain members of the staff were, he asserted, actively abetting the Nationalists against the Crown. The surrounding of His Majesty’s Legation in town by the Cossack brigade under the orders of Colonel Liakhoff, with a view to prevent persons seeking from approaching the Legation precincts, further accentuated the already strained relations. In his reports to St. Petersburg, M. de Hartwig endeavoured to minimize these insults and accused Mr. Marling of exaggeration in connection with his accounts of the occurrence. He declined at first to move in order to obtain the removal of the Cossacks and insisted that the presence of the refugees in the Legation afforded a rallying point for revolutionaries, and endeavoured to justify himself to Mr. Marling by pointing out that the instructions of the tw r o representatives clearly directed that no efforts should be spared to maintain the Shah on his throne ; he even seemed more than half inclined to insinuate that the measures taken against the Legation by the orders of Colonel Liakhoff were justified. His attitude in fact w as so uncompromising that Mr. Marling was compelled to declare his inability to enter into discussion with his Russian colleague even as regards “ ascertainable facts.” For several days the tension was so great as not only seriously to endanger the relations between the two Legations, but even to jeopardize the success of the Anglo-Russiau accord, the Cossacks under the orders of Colonel Liakhoff, who wus now'acting as Governor of the town, continued to patrol the approaches to the Legation and persons entering or leaving it and obviously connected with the mission were on several occasions stopped and molested. In spite of the accord between the two Governments, M. de Hartwig appeared determined to punish His Majesty’s Legation for the part he considered it had played in interfering w T ith his own private policy. It was only after the lapse of several days and after most categorical orders has been sent from St, Petersburg to support Mr. Marling’s demands for the removal of the patrols, that M. de Hartwig consented to adopt a more friendly attitude and endeavoured to explain matters; but he still continued to make misstatements and to attack members of His Majesty’s Legation and to repeat to Mr. Marling allegations against them which he certainly must have known to be unfounded. Throughout the discussion between the tw'o Governments M. Isvolsky showed the greatest anxiety to maintain the eo operation betwreen the two pow r ers in Persia, and the Emperor himself subsequently conveyed to Sir A. Nicholson a message reiterating his desire that the Anglo-Russian accord should be observed in the most loyal manner. M. Isvolsky, indeed, seemed clearly to realize that the Russian Minister was greatly to blame for what had occurred, and that his attacksagainst the loyalty of His Majesty’s Legation were Attempts on his part to excuse his taiiure to observe the understanding between Great Britain and Russia that both rowers should abstain from interference in Persian affairs. Though M. de Hartwig’s attitude towards His Majesty’s Legation subsequently became more cordial under instructions, it was too much to expect that his convictions were in any way changed. ^ His suspicions of His Majesty’s Legation still continued to manifest themselves in various ways, and, especially in connection with the unfortunate incident that occurred on the Gulhek race-course on the 19th September, when it would seem that he scarcely carried out his instructions to co-operate in the most friendly way with Mr. Marling, or used his best efforts to smooth over difficulties, which brought the relations between the Legation and the Russian officers of the Lossack brigade again before the public notice in an unpleasant light. But more important still was his action in connection with the joint representation which he was instructed to make early in September, inviting the Shah to take steps to convoke the Medjhss and to publish at Tabreez his intention to do so, in order to relieve the serious situation m that city. As already stated, it has been throughout M. de Hartwiu -* 9 policy was that, as Russia s instrument, the Shah must at all costs be maintained in a position of practical independence of popular control. The advice M. de Hartwig was now instructed to give His Majesty was both disconcerting to himself and was he knew, distasteful to the Shah. f ihe Shah’s reply to these joint representations w r as unsatisfactory, and it is difficult to acquit M. de Hartwig of responsibility for it. His .tong audience of the Shah, whom he met on the plea of attending a review of the troops at Bagh-i-Shah, a few 7 days after the joint representations were made, and the vague account of it which he gave to Mr. Marling, taken in conjunction with the terms of the Shahs reply certainly exposed M. de Hartwig to suspicion that the “good advice he stated be had given the Shah on that occasion hardly corresponded with the terms of the joint representations. His Majesty’s subsequent attitude during the next few months undoubtedly showed that he was unable to realise that the two Legations were acting in concert. After M. de Hartwig’s departure in the middle of November and the arrival of M. de Sabline a satisfactory change in the relations between the two Legations took place. But it was not until some time later that the effect of this improvement became noticeable so far as the Shah was concerned, and there is good reason for thinking that the cause of this delay may be traced to the continued presence at Tehran of Madame de Hartwig, whoj there are not wanting grounds to believe, endeavoured after her husband’s departure to make propaganda in favour of his policy. In recording the failure of the Russian Minister to carry out the spirit of the Anglo-Russian Agreement, it is only fair to remark that while he endeavoured to act with his British colleague in connection with internal politics only when it suited him to do so, M. de Hartwig showed himself fairly willing to support His Majesty’s Legation in matters relating to the South and to the Persian Gulf in which Russia had no direct interest, and that he was generally ready to act when there w 7 ere siirns that a third Power was trying to interfere in Persian internal affairs, or when there arose any question of combating German influence. As regards the officers of the Cossack brigade in Tehran, these were on two occasions brought into unfortunate conflict with His Majesty’s Legation. But it is now generally admitted that the officers of the brigade were last year under the orders of the Russian Minister, and that it was from him that they took instructions. Thus it would seem that the real responsibility for the surrounding of the legation by Cossack patrols rested with no less a person than M. de Hartwig. Colonel Liakhoff himself has the reputation of being an honest, loyal and perhaps not very brilliantly intelligent officer, whose natural shyness and reticence, coupled with linguistic limita tions as regards languages other than Russian and Persian, causes him considerable difficulty in his intercourse with foreigners, and he is known to have bitterly resented the situation into which he was driven by the orders of his Legation. While it is difficult to acquit him entirely of disrespect towards His Majesty’s Legation and of a certain show of hostility towards some members of the staff', it is perhaps due to Colonel Liakhoff to state that he only took his cue from the head of the Russian mission. As regards other Russian officials in Persia, there is nothing in their conduct during 1908 calling for special comment except in one instance. This refers to the late Consul-General at Tabreez, M. Pokhitonow who, during the troubles in that city subsequent to the bombardment of the Medjliss, was active in his attempts to brin* 1 * [347] E12 about the entry of Russian troops, and generally showed himself an apt disciple of his chief in Tehran, German Activity, In the last yearly report the attempts to influence Persian politics on the part of the German charge d’affaires in Tehran have been fully described, and attention was called to the German efforts to establish a commercial footing in the south of Persia. In spite of the disavowal of the German Foreign Office of Baron Richthofen’s proceedings, and the declaration that their interests in Persia were of a purely commercial nature, German agents, especially during the first half of 1908, continued to show activity in various ways. In January Baron Richthofen wrote to the President of the Assembly giving assurances similar to those already obtained from the Shah by the Russian and British representatives, and induced the Turkish Ambassador to make a like communication. Further, he contrived that on the anniversary of the Shah’s coronation the Turkish and Austrian as well as the German dragomans should be received by His Majesty to offer congratulations, and that opportunity should then be taken of making a long communication about the internal situation; while up to the last moment he worked hard to obtain for his proteg 6 , M. Priem, the post of Financial Adviser. The fact that three of the most prominent Persians of the moment were strongly Germanophile, assisted him in his manoeuvres. Having failed to obtain the post of Financial Adviser for his candidate, the German charge d’affaires next took advantage of the attack made in the Medjliss upon M. Mornard, the Belgian Administrator of Customs, to press the Persian Govern ment to dismiss all the Belgian officials and to replace them by Germans, and he even went so far as to tell the Belgian Charge d’Affaires that a request to furnish Germans had been made to him by the Persian Government. This indeed was denied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the request, if ever made, probably emanated from Ehtesham-es-Sultaneh, w'ho was then President of the Assembly. The question, however, of the possible substitution for the Belgian customs officials of subjects of another nationality now having been raised, seemed to call for steps to be taken to counteract this eventuality. On the 20th February, Sir A. Nicolson was instructed to sound the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs as to the desirability of warning the Persian Government that the placing of the customs administration in the hands of the subjects of any other Great Power could not possibly have the consent of His Majesty’s Government, seeing that for the service of loans Great Britain bad a lien on the customs. M. Isvolsky agreed that instructions in this sense should be sent to M. de Hartw ig, suggesting that it should be left to the discretion of the two representa tives at Tehran as to w hether a formal warning should be delivered, as already certain remonstrances had been made by them. Already on the 26th February Mr. Marling had cautioned the Minister for Foreign Affairs against inviting German interference, and his Excellency had replied that he w r as aw r are of the dangers attending such a course and had declared that there was no question of removing the Belgian officials. It was, however, thought better to give a more formal warning, and on the 6 th March an identic note w r as addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs by the two Representatives, that rumours w r ere current of a contemplated alteration in the customs administration, and asking his Excellency to deny the report, if it was incorrect, and to confirm previous assurances given that there wmuld be no change in the present customs system. Subsequently, early in March, Mr. Marling reported that the Medjliss were seriously contemplating a proposal for the engagement of European advisers to all Government departments, adding that three of the Ministers in the newly-constituted Cabinet were entirely under German influence. Sir A. ISicolson was accordingly instructed to tell M. Isvolsky that His Majesty’s Government would not tolerate the appointment of German advisers and to suggest that joint instructions should be sent to Tehran, for discretionary use, to the effect that in the event of the question of engaging foreign advisers arising, both Govern ments would insist on application being made to them in the first instance. M. Isvolsky, however, thought that at present the possibility w r as remote, but agreed that, should the question assume a more definite form, representations should be made, and M. de Hartwig was instructed to act with Mr. Marling. Owing, however, to subsequent events, joint action w r as postponed, and the question having been shelved by the Assembly, Mr. Marling considered that a general warning would, for the present, be sufficient. About this time a further question arose in connection wdth the German schools.and the concession extending them and granting them a subvention, which Ehtesham-es-Sultaneh had induced the Shah to sign about the middle of February. There could he no doubt of the value of this institution for diffusing German ideas and influence in Persia. The subvention was to he derived from the customs which were already pledged for the service of the British loans, and His Majesty’s Govern ment accordingly viewed the matter seriously, and consulted the Itussian Government as to making representations. On the 11 th March Mr. Marling had adverted in conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the position the German Legation was trying to win for itself in Tehran by encouraging the belief that Persia could play off Germany auainst Bussia and Great Britain. There were two instances, the undoubted attempt on the part of Baron von Richthofen to displace the Belgian customs officials, and the unconstitutional act by which the Government w'ere pledged to support the German schools by a subvention charged against the customs receipts, jje repeated the warning to the Persian Government and reminded them that in the event of their deciding to employ foreign advisers, that His Majesty’s Government expected to be consulted with regard to the nationality of these officials. Mushir-ed-Dowleh maintained that he understood the situation, and asserted that both M. de Hartwig and Mr. Marling had exaggerated the extent to wdiich the Ministers were susceptible to German influence. He even denied that the subvention was to be paid out of the customs and offered to produce the note addressed to the German Legation regarding the subvention. On the note being shown it was clear that the subvention was in fact to he secured in the manner Mr. Marling had stated. A few days later a further warning was given to Mushir-ed-Dowleh in connection with the reports that were current regarding the difficulties being made over the renewal of the contracts in various educational and scientific establishments, and his Excellency again denied that there was any cause for anxiety regarding German aims, intimately it was agreed that M. de Hartwig and Mr. Marling should concert together with regard to a joint warning being given against any alienation of the customs receipts, hut Mr. Marling pointed out that the positions of Great Britain and Russia were different. The Russian Minister had already, he said, held language which might be considered sufficient, and as feeling against Russia was running high, joint action was to he deprecated. Accordingly, the matter was for the time dropped, and, owing to subsequent events, it was not until the 4th September that Mr. Marling addressed a note on the subject to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in which the Persian Government were again cautioned in general terms of their obligation to notify to His Majesty’s Government any intention to contract loans, and a warning was given that, as long as the interest of the British 1903-4 loan remained unpaid, no attempt could he permitted to pledge the resources of the country for other purposes. Early in March the new German Minister, Count Quadt, had arrived, and in conversation both with Mr. Marling and M. de Hartwig endeavoured to minimize the part played by the late Chargd d’Affaires, saying that he would always be ready to discuss matters frankly, and would, if necessary, offer explanations. Nevertheless Mr. Marling reported in May that the new Minister, though far too discreet to use any language or to do anything to wdiich exception could he taken, yet undoubtedly was pursuing the same policy, though by different means, as that initiated by Baron von Richthofen. He was losing no opportunity of warning Persians against the insidious designs of Great Britain and Russia to obtain control over the country by financial means, and it was more than suspected that he had been intriguing wdth the Persian Government against the French Minister in the matter of M. Bizot’s appointment., Thus it w T ould seem that though the clumsy methods of Baron von Richthofen have been abandoned, yet the same spirit which inspired them continues to exist in a more subtle form at the German Legation. So far the results attained have been in no way commensurate with the efforts made, hut there is good ground for thinking that the German Legation in Tehran will continue to be on the watch for opportunities to play the part of friend and adviser to Persia to the detriment of her nearer neighbours. As regards commerce, there is no doubt that systematic efforts are being made to turn the attention of the German mannfacturer to the possibilities of the extension of trade in Persia, especially in the neutral sphere established under the Angio-Russian Convention. In August the “ Berliner Tagblatt ” published tw r o lengthy letters from a Herr Mygind regarding the trade prospects on the Karun and in the oil districts. Writing in a somewhat spiteful and jealous spirit, Herr Mygind called attention to the openings offered to German trade, and intimated that were theprinciple of the “ open door ” fully observed, and only legitimate methods of com- petition employed, even in these districts where British trade was so firmly established, there would still be room for the German manufacturer to find a market. Purther attention was drawn to this subject at various times during the year by different influential German newspapers, with reference to the journey through Persia in 1907 of Herr Jung, the German Commercial Attach^ at Constantinople, and thaw of Herr Grothe in West Persia. The writers of these various articles all insist on the favourable openings Persia offers for German enterprise, and it can only be expected, though the movement is at present in its embryo stage, that, in the future, with the extension of German interests in Mesopotamia, there will take place a corresponding incrense of German activity all along the Turco-Persian frontier. In the Persian Gulf, so far, German enterprise has met with comparatively little success. The use of the German flag by four dhows at Lingah formed the subject of an inves tigation which has not yet terminated. At Mohammerab, where, at the end of 1907, Messrs. Wbnckhaus obtained the lease of a piece of ground on the river bank as a wharf and for storage purposes, it would seem that that firm had to pay very highly for hardly corresponding advantages, while the working of the Hamburg-Amerika Line in the Gulf last year appears to have been far from a profitable undertaking. As regards the oxide deposits in the Island of Hormuz, Mr. Marling reported in September that an offer had been made by the Germans to advance to the Persian Government the sum of 300,000/. in return for a twelve year’s grant of the mining concession. In view of these negotiations he reminded the Minister for Foreign Affairs that no loan or advance could be raised by the Persian Government, until His Majesty’s Government had first been offered the refusal on equal terms, and he was supported in this representation by the Russian Legation.Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] Printed for the use of the Foreign Office.

It had become evident that something more than the mere persuasion of the two legations was needed if Mohammad Aii was to be brought to cut himseli loose from his reactionary counsellors and summon a Parliament. More than once since the first representations in September made at the su^estion of [339] ^ 00 Bthe Russian Government the Shah had seemed on the point of yielding to the pressing advice tendered to him by M. Sabline and me, but all the time we bad bad to combat the conviction which reigned at the Palace that Russia was not really in earnest, and that M. Sabline’s co-operation with this legation was merely a policy of “look see.” M. Hartwig bad left in November it is true, but Mme. Hartwig remained in Tehran and whether or not she was actively mischievous—and there is some reason to think that she actually intervened with the Shah to stiffen him against our representations— her continued presence in Tehran could not but give ground for hope that her husband would return, and that the earnest advice of M. Sabline would give place to the half hearted representations of the man whom they had such good reason to know was opposed to any genuine constitutional government. 2 . On the 27th December I thought it right to recommend that the two representatives should be authorised to make it clear to the Shah that, unless he fulfilled his pledges, he would forfeit all sympathy and support of the two Govern ments. This suggestion w r as not adopted at the time, as M. Isvolsky had informed His Majesty’s Government that he was about to make detailed proposals for further joint representations to the Shah. The proposals were received by His Majesty’s Government in the middle of January, but agreement w r as not reached between the two Governments till three months later, by which time most of the principal towns in Persia were in open revolt. Ispahan was the first to follow the example of Tabreez. Here, early in January, the Bakhtiaris, headed by Samsam-es-Sultaneh, whom the Shah had foolishly antagonised by removing him from the headship of the tribe, took advantage of a popular movement against Ikbal-ed-Dowleh, the tyrannical and rapacious governor, and seized the town, Samsam-es-Sultaneh immediately declaring for the constitution. At Resht a month later a popular movement, assisted and probably engineered by a number of professional agitators from the Caucasus, believed to have been in the pay of the revolutionary committees at Baku and at other foreign centres, resulted in the murder of the governor and the establishment of a revolutionary government under Sipahdar, a wealthy land-owner of Mazanderan, who had previously held high office in various capacities under the Shah. Sipahdar, whether by chance or by design is not known, was passing through Resht at the time of the outbreak, and made no demur about accepting his election as governor. A few weeks later Bunder Abbas joined the nationalist movement under pressure from the Mujtehids of Nejef, the people seizing the Customs and appointing a governor of their own choice, and Bushire soon followed suit under the lead of Seyyid Murteza, a Tangistani Mullah. 3. The two last-named movements, as well as those which followed at Meshed and other towns, possessed no more than local importance, though that at Bushire, owing to the lawlessness of the Tangistanis called in by Seyyid Murteza, necessitated on the 9th April the landing of a force of bluejackets from His Majesty's ship “ Fox ” for the protection of foreign life and property and their retention at Bushire for six weeks, by which time Darya Begi, the newly-appointed governor, had arrived and been accepted by the local Anjuman in the nationalist interest. It was Tabreez and, in a less degree, Ispahan and Resht on which interest centred during this period. At the two latter places there were no striking developments for some time, though from both it was repeatedly announced that the revolutionary forces were about to march on Tehran to restore the constitution. With the royalist efforts concentrated against Tabreez, any serious operations against Resht and Ispahan were out of the question. A number of tatterdemalion troops w~ere by degrees assembled at Kashan, but they were never a danger to Ispahan, and the Shah doubtless looked more to dissensions among the Bakhtiaris than to active operations against them. 4. It was on Tabreez that the Shah’s hopes were centered. This Nationalist stronghold had been from early in the year completely cut off by the besieging forces from its sources of supply. The Shah and his reactionary councillors regarded its capture as a foregone conclusion, and they looked to its fall to restore the Royalist fortunes. It would, indeed, be difficult to exaggerate the moral effect that such an event would have had on the other centres of revolt, and there can be no doubt that its rescue contributed more than any other cause to the eventual success of the Nationalists In February, provisions were knowm to be failing, and in the last days of March His Majesty’s consul-general reported that several deaths from starvation had occurred, and provisions would be completely exhausted in about three weeks. A section of the Nationalists wished to treat for peace, but Sattar Khan was resolved to fight to the end. He gave out that a reserve of food was to be kept for the fighting men, and when the general stock was exhausted, the population would have to leavethe town. In these circumstances, the situation of the foreigners in the town became a matter of £reat anxiety. To an application from those legations which had nationals a Tabreez for permission to bring in food for the foreign community, the Persian Government replied that foreigners would be given a safe conduct to leave the town if they desired, an altogether illusory promise, as it was known that the military party at Tabreez would never be willins to part with such valuable hostages against the barbarities that were to be expected, in the event of the town’s fall, from the savages in the Shah’s irregular forces. The legations pressed their demand, and meanwhile an invitation from the Shah to open negotiations was accepted, and delegates were sent to Ain-ed-Dowleh’s head-quarters at Basminch. The two consuls were authorised to mediate if their good offices were solicited. These negotiations proved abortive, and the legations received no satisfactory answer from the Persian Government. On the 17th April, the local assembly begged that the two legations should demand of the Shah the suspension of hostilities, the opening of negotiations, and the introduction of food for the starving people. The two consuls reported that foreigners were in danger from the tens of thousands of starving poor who might break out at any moment and attack houses where food was to be found. M. Sabline and I knew that our instruc tions to present to the Shah our scheme of measures to be taken for the re-establish- ment of the constitution might be expected at any moment, and we felt that these would, in all probability, lead immediately to a cessation of hostilities at Tahreez. Two days later, however, we received most alarming telegrams, from which it appeared that Sattar and Bagher Khans, fearing a rising against them, were about to create a diversion by attacking the foreign consulates; and as our instructions to make the long expected general representations had not reached us, we sought an audience of the Shah for the 20th, in order to press for an armistice. With much difficulty we persuaded the Shah to grant a truce for six days, during which food was to be freely admitted into Tahreez. 5. His Majesty’s Government had already sounded the Russian Government as to the dispatch of a small force of Cossacks to Tabreez to bring away consuls and foreigners who wished to leave, and the Russian Government had decided to send troops, but on the result of our audience being known at St. Petersburg!!, orders were sent to stop their crossing the frontier. Unfortunately, however, for reasons which have never been clearly explained, the Shah’s generals received no orders regarding the armistice, and no sufficient facilities were given for the introduction of food. 1 he two consuls, on being informed of the Shah’s concession, had induced the Nationalists to cease hostilities, and the non-observance of the armistice by the Royalist generals therefore placed them in an extremely awkw T ard position. Foreigners seemed, indeed, more exposed to danger than before, and accordingly the Russian troops were again ordered to move on Tabreez. When the Tabreezis heard of their coming, there was some fanatical agitation against them, but the menace of foreign intervention was used to good purpose by the local assembly, who at once reopened negotiations with the Shah, whom they urged to come to terms with his loyal subjects, and thus avert the disgrace of a foreign occupation of Persian territory. With the dispatch of Russian troops to Tabreez the Shah saw that the game was up, and on the 25th April, he granted with a show of spontaneity an armistice of indefinite duration, and every facility for the introduction of food. With the experience to guide them of the illusory character of the truce previously granted, the two consuls-general considered that in the interest of foreign lives and property, it would be unwise to stay the advance ol the Russian troops on account of the Shah’s concessions. M. Sabline and I believed this view to be sound, and expressed our concurrence, and the troops to the number of some 4,000 arrived in the neighbourhood of Tabreez on the 30th April, the local assembly, and a few days la^er the Persian Government, receiving assurances as to the innocent and temporary character of the occupation. The arrival of the Russian troops provoked some slight agitation in Tabreez, encouraged, there is reason to believe, by the Turkish consul-general, but the more intelligent among the Nationalists used the leverage of the presence of foreign troops to continue negotiations with the Shah. They were so fai successful as to obtain an amnesty, and an assurance that the oft promised constitution in accordance w r ith religious law' would be established, 6 . Meanwhile, after three months’ negotiations, the two Governments had agreed as to the joint representations to be made to the Shah, with a view to the re-establish ment of constitutional government. Of these negotiations it need omy be said that the delay in coming to an agreement was due to a divergence of views on the question of financial assistance to the Shah, the Russian Government being anxious to give it, subject of course to strict control, as soon as the Shah had executed certain measurespreparatory to the meeting of the Medjliss, and His Majesty’s Government refusing to give their share in a joint advance until the Medjliss had met and approved. On this point there seemed no chance of agreeing as to identity of action, and, as every day was of importance if our representations were to result in a reconciliation of the Shah with his people, it was arranged that the divergence of views on the money question should not any longer delay the representations. They were made on the 22nd April, when the two representatives at a formal audience jointly urged the Shah to accept the following programme :— (a.) Mushir-es-Sultaneh and Amir Bahadur Jang to be removed from their offices. Amir Bahadur Jang to be removed not only from the cabinet, but also from any office in the Palace. (b.) After the introduction of the following reforms, the Shah to re-establish a constitutional regime. (c.) The appointment of a cabinet composed of persons worthy of confidence, and the addition without delay to the Council of the Empire of enlightened persons belonging to different parties. The council to elaborate and promulgate a new electoral law. If the Shah chooses people for the cabinet or council not inspiring confidence, no money advances will be made to Persia. (d.) The immediate proclamation of a general amnesty to cover all those who have taken up arms against the Shah and who have committed political offences, but to exclude those who have committed offences against the common law. As regards these latter, and those who have committed acts of brigandage, guarantees to be given by the Persian Government that they shall have an impartial trial. (s.) A date to be immediately fixed for the elections and for the convocation of the Assembly. These dates to be made known without delay to the whole country. (/.) As soon as the measures enumerated in paragraphs (a) to (d) have been taken by the Shah, the Russian Government may, if it thinks necessary, make an advance to the Persian Government of 100,000/. for the urgent expenses necessitated by the introduction of reforms. The British Government will, if it considers it necessary, make a similar advance to the Persian Government as soon as the elected Assembly has adopted this advance. If it is afterwards found necessary to facilitate a larger loan to Persia, this could only be effected under certain guarantees which will form the object of a subsequent exchange of views between the two Governments and the Persian Government. These representations differed from those hitherto made in that we were authorised to give the Shah a warning which could leave him in no doubt that Russia was in earnest. We stated to him, categorically, that if he did not accept the programme in all its details, the two Governments would desist from giving advice and would leave His Majesty to his own resources, when he would no longer be able to count upon any support from the two Powers. The Shah expressed satisfaction with our representations, which showed the interest of the two Powers in the prosperity of Persia, and promised a reply after consultation with his Government. 7. Of the cabinet as then composed, the only member who was not frankly reactionary was Saad-ed-Dowleh, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Saad-ed-Dowleh had been appointed early in January with the approval of M. Sabiine and myself, and with assurances of our support so long as he worked for the re-establishment of parliamentary government. As my colleague and I have been a good deal criticised for the backing we gave to Saad-ed-Dowleh, I feel it right to say that we were well aware, at the time we assured him of our support, that he had strongly developed many of the faults common to Persian officials, but, bad as his past record had been, we knew r him to be able and, for a Persian, courageous; and I still think, in the light of subsequent events, that we were justified in our belief that he alone, of all possible candidates for the post, stood any chance of effectually backing our represen tations with the Shah and withstanding the influence of the Shah’s reactionary Ministers and favourites. During the days succeeding our audience, there were a series of councils at the Palace, at which our representations were discussed, Saad-ed-Dowleh being practically the only man present who urged following the advice of the two Powers. That reactionary counsels were prevailing with the Shah was soon made quite plain. Although he had dismissed Mushir-es-Sultaneh, the reactionary Grand Vizier, he had appointed in his place his own uncle, Naib-os- Sultaneh, a reactionary of the most pronounced type. This appointment was followedimmediately by the dismissal of Saad-ed-Dowleh. To allow this open flouting of the two legations would have destroyed all chance of obtaining from the Shah an honest execution of our programme and therefore, although it had been agreed between London and Petersburgh that we were to go no further than private suggestion as regards the composition of the reform cabinet, we felt it our duty to protest strongly, md we informed the Shah that unless he forthwith dismissed Naib-es-Sultaneh and reinstated Saad-ed-Dowleh we should consider that he had definitely rejected the advice of the two Powers. We also took advantage of a meeting with delegates of the Shah, held on the 7th May, for the purpose of discussing the details of our programme, to insist on the appointment of Nasr-ul-Mulk as Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, and to suggest privately the names of other suitable Ministers for a reform cabinet. 8 . Meanwhile the rescue of Tabreez from the Shah’s troops had been followed a few days later by the capture of Kazvin by the revolutionaries from Resht. The Shah was seriously alarmed. Over and over again during the preceding months he had pressed the two legations for guarantees for his throne, and in December, they had verbally assured him that so long as he ruled honestly as a constitutional sovereign, he would have the support and sympathy of the two legations, and he could also count on them for the protection of his person if necessary. H e now begged my colleague and me to extend these guarantees to his throne and family, but we told him we could do no more than give him in writing what had been said in December. He could have these written assurances W'hen he followed our advice. He was obliged to content himself with this, and he finally yielded, reappointing as Minister for Foreign Affairs, Saad ed-Dowleh, whom he summoned to Bagh-i-Shah on the 9th May, ordering him to give effect to our programme. A Cabinet was formed as far as possible in accordance with our suggestions. Nasr-ul-Mulk was unfortunately in Europe; he w r as, however, summoned to return by the Shah, and pending his arrhal Saad-ed-Dowleh was to act as Prime Minister. A general amnesty was proclaimed on the 10th May, and a decree was issued restoring the old constitution, and ordering the immediate elaboration of a new electoral law by a committee of Nationalists. The electoral law' was to be promulgated when ready, and the Medjliss was to be convoked as soon as there was a quorum in Tehran. 9. For a few weeks things went smoothly, and there seemed good grounds for thinking that Mohammad Ali would have another chance of ruling as a constitutional sovereign. Three hundred Nationalists, who bad taken “ bast” at the Turkish Embassy as a demonstration in favour of the constitution in December, and had remained there ever since, dispersed. The Shah moved to his country palace at Sultanabad, announcing that he had left matters in the hands of his Cabinet. No time was lost in the formation of the electoral law committee, w 7 hich at once set to work over the new law. Reports from the provinces, where the British and Russian consular officers had been instructed to point out to the Nationalists that it was now' their duty to work for a reconciliation of the Shah and his people, show r ed that the Shah’s decrees had generally been well received ; especially in Tabreez, whence the local assembly telegraphed to that of Ispahan, urging the reception of the Shah’s concessions in a con ciliatory spirit. 10. As time went on, however, a good deal of discontent became apparent at the capital, where the Nationalists especially resented the Shah’s retention at his Court of Amir Bahadur Jang and other reactionary favourites. We had, in our representa tions to the Shah, advised the dismissal of Amir Bahadur Jang from all posts at the Palace, but the Russian Government were disinclined to press for more than his removal from the post of Minister of War, in the event of the Shah insisting on keeping him at the Palace in some other capacity. At first Amir Bahadur Jang kept in the background, and M. Sabline and I therefore agreed to raise no objection to his continued presence at the Palace. Subsequently, I had reason to believe that he was regaining influence with the Shah, and when I realised how his retention at Court was resented by the Nationalists, I suggested to Saad-ed-Dowleh that we should press for his removal from the Shah’s Court. Saad-ed-Dowleh, however, assured me that he was now harmless and, finding M. Sabline of the same opinion, I let the matter drop. It would, I think, have been to the Shah’s interest had I persevered and secured so tangible a sign of His Majesty’s sincerity. There were, however, other factors which contributed to the discontent of the Nationalists. They complained that Mukhber-ed-Dowleh, Minister of Telegraphs, would not permit telegrams to pass betw r een the different .Nationalists centres. The Acting Prime Minister had also become the object of widespread distrust. M. Sabline and I had looked principally [339] C6 to Nasr-ul-Mulk, who enjoys a reputation unique amongst Persians for honesty of purpose, to gain for the reform Cabinet the confidence of the people. Unfortunately, !Nasr-ul-Muik refused to return from Europe to take office. This unfortunate circumstance left Saad-ed-Dowleh acting Prime Minister. He had never enjoyed the trust of the Nationalists, and now the belief gained ground that he was responsibly for the continuance of the Russian force at Tabreez. Forgetful of the service thdu the opportune arrival of these troops had rendered to the constitutional cause, the Nationalists, directly the danger to Tabreez was over, began an agitation for their withdrawal, which gained strength owing to the tactless conduct of General Snarsky, who showed undue severity against one party in a Persian quarrel, which he ought to have left the Persian authorities to deal with. The foolish interference with the local Government in this and other matters led to Sattar Khan and Bagher Khan taking “ bast ” at the Turkish consulate-general. The two heroes of the defence of Tabreez w ere thus able to pose as martyrs to Russian tyranny. There was a good deal of anti- Russian agitation in the capital and elsewhere and, unreasonable as it may seem, the indignation of the Nationalists provoked by these events, focussed itself against the Sbab and his first Minister, though if anybody had been injured by the coming of the Russian troops, it was the Shah himself. 11 . But although it w r as evident that the good effect of the Shah’s concessions had worn off, and that the distrust felt for Mohammad Ali was as strong as ever, we had no reason to expect that the Bakhtiaris and Sipahdar w r ere about to abandon their expectant attitude. The worst that seemed in any way likely, was that a certain number of each force would remain under arms at Ispahan and Kazvin as a menace to the Shah until the meeting of the Medjliss, for wdiich the electoral law, though not promulgated, was already prepared. The Bakhtiaris showed no sign of moving, though the dissensions among them, wdiich w T ere understood to have kept them from advancing on Tehran in the spring, had been composed, and though Sardar Assad, who was expected to lead the expedition, had arrived from Paris. Many of them were reported to have dispersed to their homes and it was said that the rest would be disbanded shortly. At Kazvin, it is true, the outlook was less hopeful, for though it was felt that the Russian Legation could keep Sipahdar quiet as he owed large sums to the Russian bank, there was reason to believe that the force with him, which contained a nucleus of determined revolutionaries who were credited with the intention of dethroning the Shah, was not properly under his control. But even at Kazvin there were no signs of an approaching movement on Tehran. Indeed, M. Sabline’s information was that a number of the force had left for the north, and that Sipahdar was coming to Tehran to make his peace with the Shah. 12. In these circumstances I felt justified in reporting, in the middle of June, when taking stock of the results of the execution of our programme so far as it had gone, that the danger of the Bakhtiari in Ispahan and the revolutionaries at Kazvin advancing on Tehran, which was at one time believed to be imminent, was now [ probably remote. Before I had signed the despatch in question, Sardar Assad had called on His Majesty’s consul-general at Ispahan to announce his departure for Tehran, and on the following day, the 17th June, he left Ispahan with a force j variously estimated at from 700 to 1,000 men. At first I was inclined to think that this move was a mere demonstration prompted by the amour propre of the man w ho had come from Paris as the champion of the constitutional cause, and found the w r ind taken out of his sails by the Shah’s concessions. If this was the case it would need very little to arrest his march to the capital. Immediately on receipt of the news of his departure from Ispahan, I sent him a message through His Majesty's consul- general, assuring him that the preparatory work for the restoration of the constitution w T as proceeding smoothly and that demonstrations of the kind he contemplated could only retard and complicate matters. The message produced no effect and it soon became evident that the movement was a serious one and undertaken in combination with Sipahdar’s force in the north. Reinforcements were reported as being prepared both at Resht and Ispahan and telegrams were intercepted passing between Sardar Assad and Sipahdar and the foreign Anjumans. 13. It will be remembered that the two legations had promised the Shah their support and sympathy so long as he ruled as a constitutional sovereign. They were bound therefore to spare no effort to arrest Sardar Assad’s advance. The two consuls-general at Ispahan were accordingly despatched to overtake him at Kum, but their joint remonstrances met with no success, Sardar Assad asserting that the two legations had been grossly deceived and that the Shah’s concessions were nothing but a sham. To Mr. Grahame, in a private interview, he frankly admitted that he was7 sians for honesty of pie. Unfortunately, This unfortunate ad never enjoyed the , he was responsible al of the service tha u ditutional cause, the i agitation for their of General Snarsky, 1, which he ought to erence with the local Bagher Khan taking ence of Tabreez w r ere a good deal of anti- 3 as it may seem, the sed itself against the id by the coming of i Shah’s concessions s strong as ever, w r e out to abandon their , was that a certain Kazvin as a menace ilectorai law, though 1 no sign of moving, have kept them from hough Sardar Assad, ms. Many of them lat the rest would be opeful, for though it he owed large sums rce with him, which i credited with the mtrol. But even at m Tehran. Indeed, ‘ft for the north, and Shah. the middle of June, mme so far as it had iutionaries at Kazvin imminent, was now n, Sardar Assad had ee his departure for spahan with a force tclined to think that opre of the man w ho , and found the wdud le case it would need eceipt of the news of is Majesty's consul- m of the constitution e contemplated could o effect and it soon nken in combination ed as being prepared sing between Sardar nised the Shah their &gt;vereign. They were advance. The two ike him at Kum, but lerting that the two Dns were nothing but dmitted that he was proceeding to Tehran m prder utterly to cripple the Shah, and he added that he would depose him were it not for fear of liussian intervention. It. By this time news had reached Tehran of Sipahdar’s advance to within 40 miles of Tehran. The greatest alarm prevailed at the Palace and indeed the outlook for the Shah was well-nigh desperate. The Royalist troops in the capital, with the exception of 800 or 900 Persian Cossacks w ho were there and a small force of Bakhtiaris under Amir Mufakham, who with one brother had alone amongst the .Bakhtiari khans remained loyal to the Shah, were of a kind to inspire no confidence wdiatever. No money was to be had, for the 100,000/. promised by the Russian Government, when certain parts of our programme had been executed, was not available. Not only had the new electoral law not been promulgated—a condition precedent of the advance—but the Government, finding that M. Sabline insisted on strict control of the expenditure, had let the negotiations for the conditions of the advance drag on so that, by the time everything was in order, hostilities had com menced. M . Sabline felt that to give the money at that stage would be interpreted as helping the Shah in a civil war and he withheld the money. To add to the difficulties of the situation the Cabinet, with the exception of Saad-ed-Dowleh, w r ere in a state of complete demoralisation; they had resigned on the 25th June, and though the Shah had ordered them to carry on temporarily, Saad-ed-Dowleh w r as the only one who had the courage really to resume his functions. The others, while carrying on current business, absolutely declined to do anything involving responsibility. In this pitiable plight, the Shah summoned M. Sabline and me to Sultanabad and asked our advice. The audience was a very distressing one for it was evident, though he did not give utterance to his view T s, that His Majesty thought that it was through his following our advice that things had come to this pass. TV e reminded him that he had delayed many months in following the advice of the two Pow r ers and we said that at this juncture we did not know what counsels to give him but we would, if any opportunity offered, use our influence towards a peaceful settlement. The impression left on me by the audience was that the Shah had, until now, had some hopes that Russia would intervene in his support and that our non pos&amp;umus attitude was a bitter disappointment to him. 15. Meanwhile the news that our efforts to stop Sardar Assad at Kum had failed, coupled wdth the advance of Sipahdar from Kazvin, had aroused exaggerated fears in St. Petersburgh of the danger to w T hich Russian life and property on the Resht road and in the capital might be exposed. I do not know how far my Russian colleague was responsible for these alarmist views. Several messages had been received by the foreign legations from different Nationalist centres—in particular one from Kazvin— which, though I believe they' were meant merely as disclaimers of any responsibility for casualties amongst the Russan officers of the Persian Cossack brigade who, it w'as now pretty well known, had orders to oppose the rebels, were generally interpretated as a menace to all Russians. Although I induced the most prominent Nationalists of Tehran to issue a reassuring circular to the legations, the harm had been done, and a good pretext given for raising the cry of danger to foreigners. It is, however, only fair to M. Sabline to say that he declared to me in the most positive fashion that he never sent any reports to his Government warranting the apprehension voiced to Mr. O’Beirne by M. Isvolsky at the beginning of July, of “a general massacre and pillage of Europeans by hordes of Bakhtiari and Caucasian revOlutionaries. ,, He certainly asked that troops should be sent to keep the road open, but the purpose I think Which he had principally in view was that they should serve as moral support to the Shah, and he hoped that their mere presence would deter the revolutionaries from proceeding to extremities. His hopes proved fallacious and indeed the coming of the troops tended rather to precipitate events, and was made the occasion by the Anjumans at Constantinople and other places to urge the revolutionaries to hasten and “ make an end of the business.” 16. The despatch of a Russian force to Kazvin w'as decided upon, but the troops did not actually land at Enzcli until a second effort of the two legations to arrest the march of the rebels on the capital had failed. On the 4th July, delegates from both legations were sent to Sardar Assad, who had now r reached Robat-Kerim, and to Sipahdar at Keredj, 25 miles out of Tehran on the Resht road. On the way to Keredj, Major Stokes and M. Baronowsky found fighting already proceeding at Shahahad between the Persian Cossacks and Sipahdar’s men. The message which the delegates were to convey to the two leaders was to the effect that the only way to avoid intervention w r as to restore order and to give the constitution, as now re-established, a fair chance. If Sipahdar and Sardar Assad asked for guarantees,they were to be told we would endeavour to obtain them. Our messages made no impression. Both leaders declared the Shah s concessions to be illusory, and pointed to the retention of his reactionary favourites at the Palace as a proof. Our offer to do our best to obtain guarantees for the execution of the constitution elicited no definite reply from Sardar Assad, who parted from Mr. Churchill with the words ;£ Au revoir a Teheran.” Sipahdar, on the other hand, gave Major Stokes and M. Baronowsk) a list of what he called the demands of the nationalists, with a view to the two legations putting them before the Shah. He promised to wait two days lor our reply. The demands were as follows :— (a.) Sipabdar and Sardar Assad, each with 150 Nationalist troops with adequate guarantees, should be permitted to come to Tehran to discuss the following points. After they had assured themselves that their demands would be executed the Nationalist troops would return to their homes. They demanded— (b.) The evacuation of Persian territory by the forces of the neighbouring Powers. . . (c.) The right of the local Anjumans to choose the Ministers until the opening of Parliament, after which their selection should he in accordance with the law. (d.) The expulsion of traitors and those obnoxious to the people. (e.) The disarmament of persons who had been recently armed but did not form part of the army. ( f.) The recognition of the Minister of War as undisputed head of all the armed forces of the state and of the arsenals. (^.) The dismissal of Mukhber-ed-Dowlck from his post as Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, (A.) The obligation on the part of the Government to consult the local Anjumans in the appointment of governors. 17. It was clearly out of the question to press such terms on the Shah, though we told Sipahdar that if he would be content with the dismissal of the Shah’s reactionary favourites, we would urge the two demands relating to this point, viz., “ d ” and “ g ” upon His Majesty. A third effort to arrest the two leaders, who had now joined hands about 16 miles to the west of the capital, was made on the 10th July, when, having obtained from the Shah with great difficulty a pledge that he would expel his favourites if the rebels would desist from hostilities and disarm their followers, we wrote to them, urging them in response to a conciliatory message despatched by Saad-ed-Howleh, to send delegates to negotiate with the Government and assuring them of onr conviction that His Majesty would grant such of their demands as were constitutional. Before, however, this message reached the sardars, fighting had already been resumed on the 10th July and they replied that they could not send delegates while being continually attacked and while the road was blocked by Royalist troops. They asked for delegates to be sent to them and promised to remain on the defensive till sunset of the 12th July. 1 communicated this reply to Sand ed-Dowleh and my colleague and I then decided that we must let matters take their course. 18. The fighting of the 10th and 11th July was indecisive and the rebel forces managed to elude the vigilance of Captain Zapolsky and his Cossacks and entered Tehran to the number of about 2,000 on the morning of the 13th. Sardar Assad and Sipahdar marched straight to Baharistan. where they took up their quarters. It seems unnecessary to give the details of the three days street fighting which ensued or of the desultory and harmless bombardment of the town by the Shah’s artillery from Kasr Kajar, which marked the second day of the struggle. The utter wnrth- lessness of the royalist troops, with the exception of the few hundreds of Persian Cossacks under Colonel Liakhow and the small force of royalist Bakhtiaris under Amir Mufakham, made the victory of the revolutionaries from the moment of their entry into the capital a foregone conclusion, provided that the Russian force, w T hich had by this time reached the neighbourhood of Kazvin, did not intervene. The plight of the Russian officers of the Cossack brigade and especially of Colonel Liakhow, against whom the Nationalists had a special grudge, wns one to occasion the gravest anxiety, and the temptation to M. Sabline to bring the Russian troops on to the capital must have been very strong. The troops had orders not to come beyond Kazvin, except in the event of danger to foreign lives and property, and M. Sabline, though pressed in the most harassing fashion by his colony to give the troops the order to advance on Tehran, steadfastly refused to take this step, which must have led to active intervention on behalf of the Shah and which was not needed in theinterest of foreigners. No foreigner, indeed, with the exception of the Cossack officers, who naturally had to run the risk of combatants, was in danger at any time, except from stray bullets, and, as a matter of fact, there was no serious casualty at all in the foreign community. Even the Russian officers escaped without hurt. Moreover, owing to the Shah’s taking refuge at the Russian Legation before the ^ossack brigade was reduced to extremities, Colonel Liakhow was able to surrender with honour and, with the help of the two legations, to secure terms involving the retention of the services of the Russian officers. 19. The Sbah with bis family, and with Amir Bahadur and other palace favourites took “ bast ” at Zerguendeh at 8 o’clock on the morning of the 16th; that archcoward, Naib-es-Sultaneh, jthe Shah’s uncle, having already taken refuge there three days before. Sipahdar and Sardar Assad were at once informed, and Mr. Churchill and M. Baranowsky were sent to town to obtain as good terms as possible for the Cossack brigade. As already noticed, the negotiations were successful, the two leaders giving a written undertaking to the following effect:— “ We, the undersigned, temporary chiefs of the Persian Government and nation, hereby declare that the Cossack brigade remains temporarily, as before, under the orders of the colonel, on condition that he is completely under the orders of the Minister of War, who will to-day be appointed. The officers, men, and their families w r ill not be subjected to interference.” Colonel Liakhow drove, escorted by a relative of Sardar Assad, to Baharistan, where he placed the brigade at the service of the two leaders. By the afternoon the fighting had ceased. An extraordinary grand council, composed of nationalist notables, members of the clergy, and of the late Medjliss, assembled at Baharistan and voted the deposition of the Shah, and the elevation to the throne of his son, Sultan Ahmed. They also elected Azad-ul-Mulk, Regent; Sipahdar, Minister of War, and Sardar Assad, Minister of the Interior. It was decided to send a deputation to Mohammad Ali to announce the change of Sovereign. This decision was notified to His Majesty through the two legations, but he replied that, having left Sultanatabad and come to Zerguendeh, he had abdicated. The deputation was therefore unnecessary. His Majesty knew r that the Yaliahd had been chosen as his successor, and at first was very anxious that his second son should take his place. Indeed, he asked us to arrange this for him, but we thought it better not to comply as our efforts in this direction might be taken advantage of to deprive the dynasty of the throne. His Majesty himself thought of this danger later, and he begged us to do nothing which might have this result. We merely, therefore, informed Sipahdar and Sardar Assad that, His Majesty having abdicated, the deputation was unnecessary. Sultan Ahmed was proclaimed Shah that evening (17th July); his accession was notified to the foreign legations on the following day and the two Powers recognised the new Shah on the 21st July. 20. It had been arranged between the two Governments that if Mohammad Ali took refuge in either of the two legations, he was to be regarded as under the protection of both and to be escorted to the frontier by a joint Anglo-Russian guard. Immediately, therefore, on his return at the Russian Legation, the two flags were placed over the front door, which thereafter was guarded by a Bussian Cossack and an Indian sowar. My Russian colleague was instructed to assure Mohammad Ali Mirza of a suitable reception in Russia, but it required a number of messages from the Emperor before the ex-Shah could be brought to understand that he must entertain no hope of support for the recovery of his throne. His presence at the Russian Legation w'as a source of continual anxiety to my colleague and me, but fortunately, though he did not leave until the 9th September, the plots which members of his suite were believed to be hatching came to nothing. 21. The delay in his departure was due, in the first instance, to the difficulty in bringing the ex-Shah and the new Government to agreement regarding the restitution of the Crown jewels and the settlement of his civil list. At first the two legations held aloof and left the Nationalists to negotiate on these points direct with Mohammad Ali, and it was only when matters reached a deadlock, owing, on the one hand, to the parsimony of the Nationalists in regard to the civil list, and on the other to the unreasonable attitude of the Shah as regards the jew r els, that the two legations took the negotiations into their ow T n hands. With great difficulty they induced the Government to increase the civil list from the 25,000 tomans originally offered to 75,000 tomans, and in return the Shah was to hand over ail the Crown jewels amongst his effects at the legation, and as far as possible facilitate the recovery of the rest. [339] I)10 But the solution of these points did not by any means put an end to our difficulties. Bor on the one hand the Nationalists raised the question of the treatment of those in ' bast ” with the ex-Shah at the Russian Legation, against whom the new Government wished to proceed for political and other offences, and on the other the Russian Government desired that before the country was safely rid of Mohammad Ali, the new Government should arrange fora satisfactory settlement of His Majesty i private debts to the Russian bank, amounting to 2,400,000 tomans, and secured on his private property in Azerbaijan. The course which commended itself both to the Persian Government and to the two legations was that the ex-Shah should surrender his property, the Persian Government taking over the debt. As this would leave His Majesty entirely dependent upon his civil list, the legations further proposed that it should be slightly increased. The debt carried the exorbitant interest of 12 per cent., and the property, at the highest estimate known to us, brought in no more than 100,000 tomans a year. The proposed arrangement was, therefore, clearly profitable to the ex-Shah. It was also welcome to the Persian Government as freeing them from the danger of Russian control of the property. Mohammad Ali at first refused to consent to the arrangement, and in this for some time he enjoyed the support of the Russian Government, which had been grossly deceived as to the value of the mortgaged property by M. Chapchal and others of his kidney. These persons made out that the property was worth 400,000 tomans a year, and that the proposed arrangement would, therefore, b^ a grave injustice to Mohammad Ali. The Russian Government also feared that if His Majesty was left no private property his family, in the event of his death, might be left on their hands. The repeated assurances, however, of the two legations corroborated by the two consular officers at Tabreez that M. Chapchals estimate was greatly above the mark, and the readiness of the Persian Government to allow His Majesty’s family, in the event of his death, a civil list of 25,000 tomans, at length satisfied the Russian Government, and they consented to enjoin upon His Majesty the necessity of accepting the proposed arrangements, provided the civil list was raised from 75,000 to 100,000 tomans a year. His Majesty accepted this advice without demur, and the Persian Government consented to the increase of his civil list. As regards the treatment of the other “ bastis,” the Persian Government did not press for their trial for political offences, but they naturally could not allow them immunity from civil suits. At the same time, it was very desirable that the country should be rid of these reactionaries with the least possible delay, and it was at last arranged that they should be allowed to depart with the ex-Shah on condition that each one left his pow r er of attorney with a repre sentative, against whom civil claims could be prosecuted in the presence of a member of the Russian Legation. The result of these wearisome negotiations was embodied in a protocol, signed on the 8th September by M. Sabline and me, and on the following day by all the members of the Cabinet. On the 9th the ex-Shah left the Russian Legation at Zerguendeh with his family and most of the reactionaries who had been in “ bast ” with him, escorted by 120 Persian cossacks under a Russian officer and a delegate and a guard of three men from each legation. At Kazvin the 120 Persian cossacks gave place to an escort from the Russian force in that town. The journey to the Caspian occupied three weeks, and the Shah embarked for Petrowsk en route for Odessa on the 30th September. 22. For the seven weeks which elapsed between Mohammad Ali’s dethronement and his departure from Zerguendeh, the direction of affairs was really in the hands of a body known at first as the committee and later as the directoire. A Cabinet had been formed immediately after the fighting had ceased in Tehran, but except for Sipahdar, the Minister of War and Sardar Assad, the Minister of the Interior, the members were merely figure heads. The committee, consisting of twenty-five members, had been elected expressly for the guidance of the Cabinet by the same Extraordinary Grand Council at Baharistan which dethroned the Shah. For some weeks this arrangement worked smoothly, but shortly before Mohammad Ali left Zerguendeh there were signs of friction between the committee and the Cabinet. The two leaders of the Ministry, Sipahdar and Sardar Assad—the former especially— though themselves members of the committee, showed a tendency to act inde pendently of the latter, who complained that the money given to Sipahdar for the troops was appropriated to his own use. Things at length reached a point where the committee decided to abandon the attempt to co-operate with the Cabinet and to leave the latter to shift for itself. Mohammad Ali’s departure offered a good opportunity for it to dissolve itself, and it was publicly announced on the 13th September that the ex-Shah’s departure meant the restoration of normal condi-tions of Government, and therefore an anomalous body like the committee was no longer needed. For a time it looked as though a portion of the committee were working up an opposition to the two leaders with a view to attacking them in the Medjliss, hut the arrival at the end of October of Nasr-ul-Mulk, who at once made it clear that he would neither accept office nor be a party to any attempt to upset the Cabinet, put a stop to any such designs. His influence brought about a reconcilia tion, and when Sipahdar and Sardar Assad, on the meeting of the Medjliss on the 15th November, placed their resignations as a matter of form in the hands of the Regent, and Azad-ul-Mulk refused to accept them, the assembly unanimously approved his action and at the same time confirmed him in his post as regent. This was tantamount to a vote of confidence in the administration during the provisional regime, and since then there has. up to the close of the year, not been any sign of opposition from the Medjliss. It is much to be hoped that no such opposition will develop, at least until the financial situation has improved and until the central Government has something besides its prestige wherewith to maintain its authority. Unpromising as the situation is to-day, it would be far more so if, owing to any cause, it were to lose the one asset on which it has hitherto been able to count, namely, the prestige of the victorious revolutionary leaders. 23. Too weak to collect the Maliat, the main source of revenue in normal times, the new Government has had to subsist almost entirely on forced contributions from wealthy reactionaries, indeed, had it not been for such windfalls as the 100,000 tomans \ extorted from Zil-es-Sultan, who most imprudently returned to Persia in defiance of the advice of Great Britain and Russia and had to pay through the nose for * permission to leave again, it is hard to see how the Government could have carried on at all. Indeed, the w r onder is not so much that the Central Government has failed to put the country in order but that the seats of disorder are as few as they are. In Tehran itself all has been quiet since fighting ceased on the 16th July. Perfect order has been maintained under the able police administration of Yprim who, whatever may have been his record in the past—and the Russian Government believe him to be a fugitive from Russian justice—has served the new Government loyally And well. The Bakhtiari force and the much dreaded Mujaheddin, who accompanied Sipahdar on his march to Tehran, have not proved themselves a danger to public peace, and this notwithstanding that they have not always been regularly paid. The Bakhtiari, of whom there are now some 500 in Tehran, appear to be entirely obedient to Sardar Assad, and though there are some undesirables among the Mujaheddin, many of them Russian subjects, the Government when it gets money intends to pay off these, retaining in the army only the better elements. 24. In the provinces the rebellion was generally well received, and, until the end of October, with the exception of a robber raid on the town of Rafsinjan, on the Yezd- Kerman road, which calls for mention because two British subjects, Mr. James, of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, and Mr. Wright, of the Imperial Bank of Persia, who were in the town at the time, were exposed to great danger, there were no disorders worth recording. During this period even the chronic lawlessness on the southern road diminished somewhat. Trouble at one time threatened at Shiraz. Soulet-ed-Dowleh, head of the Kashgai, had advanced on the town announcing his intention of preventing Ala-ed-Dowleh, the newly-appointed governor, from taking up his post. The Government wisely decided to temporise with him. They revoked Ala-ed-Dowleh’s appointment, and selected a governor in his place to whom Soulet- ed-Dowleh raised no objection. This immediately relieved the situation, Soulet and his tribesmen withdrawing from Shiraz, and the incident only calls for mention because the outlook at one time appeared so serious as to necessitate the dispatch of a detach ment of sepoys from Bush ire for the reinforcement of the Shiraz consular guard. In • Tabreez, where the bulk of the Russian troops had so far been retained in the fear that Mukhber-es-Sultaneh, who had been appointed governor in opposition to the wishes of the Russian Government, would not be able to control Sattar and Bagher Khans and their men, the new governor had by the middle of October so far established his authority that the Russian force was reduced to 1,100 men. The Russian govern ment had also decided to withdraw the Russian troops from Kazvin, but just at this moment the comparative tranquillity which had characterised the early days of the new Government was rudely broken by the rising of the Shahsevans in the district of Ardebil at the instigation of the Karadaghi brigand chief Rahim Khan. Forces sent from Tabreez under Sattar Khan proved incapable of dealing with the rebels, and Rahim Khan captured and plundered the town of Ardebil. The withdrawal of the Kazvin force was postponed, the Russian Government being apparently of opinionthat Eahim Khan, who, though really bent on nothing but loot, had given out that he was fighting in the cause of the ex-Shah, might march on Tehran. A battalion of Russian troops was also sent to Ardebil to protect Russian lives and property and to keep the Astara-Ardebil road open, with the result that Rahim Khan and the Shah- sevans withdrew. For some time there was talk of a Russian punitive expedition against the Shahsevans, with whom, apart from the damage done to Russian property in Ardebil, the Russians had old scores to settle. The authorities of the Caucasus were very anxious for this course, and, indeed, dispatched a regiment to join the batal- lion already at Ardebil. Possibly this step was taken independently of St. Petersburgh, for almost immediately after the regiment’s arrival at Ardebil it was decided, for the moment at least, to leave the punishment of the Shahsevans to the Persian Government, and the regiment was recalled. Meanwhile the Persian Government had wdth great difficulty managed to dispatch a respectable force, containing a nucleus of Bakhtiaris under Sardar Assad’s son and Mujaheddin under Yprim. This force was delayed by the necessity of suppressing in the course of its march a miniature rebellion at Zinjan, and only came to blows with the Karadaghis a few days ago. It is reported to have gained some successes, but until Rahim Khan had been completely subdued and compensation for Russian losses, which I believe are put as high as 80,000/., obtained, the outlook in Azerbaijan will be anything but hopeful, for there is good reason to believe that if Persia does not succeed in exacting this compensation, Russia will at a convenient season take the matter into her own hands. 25. Another province where the outlook has again become threatening is Pars. Here, as we have noticed, the Government found itself compelled to temporise with the head of the Kashgai, and at his dictation to revoke the appointment of a governor to whom he was opposed. Saham-ed-Dowleh, who was substituted for Ala-ed- Dowleh in the governorship, proved himself a man of firmness and character, and though the central Government was unable to supply him with proper military force, succeeded for some time by dint of great severity, in maintaining a fair measure of authority. The province was unusually quiet for a time, and there was even talk of sending (3ack to Bushire the detachment of sepoys which had been dispatched to reinforce the consular guard, but the winter migration of the Kashgai was marked by a serious recrudescence of disorders, for which there is good reason to think that Soulet-ed-Dowleh was responsible. The Kashgai chief was naturally extremely jealous of the prominent part played by the Bakhtiari in the revolution and of the wealth and influence they are said to have acquired thereby, and it would probably have been a wiser policy for Saham-ed-I)owleh to attempt to conciliate him. Perhaps this was impossible for the nominee of Sardar Assad. At any rate, whether under orders from Sardar Assad or on his own responsibility, Saham-ed-Dowleh threw in his lot with the powerful Kawami family, which is in perpetual feud with the Kashgai. Thus reasons of self-defence conspired with his jealousy of Sardar Assad to make Soulet-ed-Dowleh take up an attitude of defiance to the new governor, and the series of outrages on the Busliire-Ispahan road which marked the closing weeks of the year, though directly the work of the Boir Ahmedi tribe, are generally attributed to his instigation. 20. Of these outrages the most serious was the attack on the caravan of M. Passek, the Russian consul-general at Bushire, near Dastarjin, on the 24th November. M. Passek was proceeding from Shiraz to his post with an escort of Russian Cossacks and with a large caravan of merchandise, which had attached itself to his party for safety, when he was attacked by 250 Boir Ahmedis. M. Passek was himself exposed to the greatest danger. One of his Cossacks was killed and another wounded. The caravan w T as looted, and there were a number of casualties among the Persian guards. There is no doubt that, had the central Government had the means necessary to enforce such a measure, the dismissal of Soulet-ed-Dowleh in default of his assistance for the discovery of those guilty of this outrage and for the exaction of reparation w r ould have been advisable, and this course w r as strongly urged by M. Passek and Mr. Bill, hut M. Poklewski and I felt that it would be dangerous to press the Govern ment too far to take measures which might turn Soulet-ed-Dowleh into an open enemy at a moment w hen it w 7 as little able to cope with a rebellion in Pars. The outrage has, indeed, remained unpunished, and the road has since been completely blocked in places, the Boir Ahmedis continuing their depredations until, at the close of the year, the cold drove them from their positions. The recent operations of these lawless tribesmen have been on a much larger and more organised scale than the sporadic robberies which have for long been a feature of the southern roads, and the■wealth and prestige they have acquired by their successes and their impunity make them a formidable danger for the future, all the more so if, as is generally believed, they have worked with, the connivance of the Khashgai. So seriously does the British acting consul at Shiraz think of the situation created by the recent recrudescence of disorders, that he has advocated a British punitive expedition against ie Boir Ahmedis, in the belief that no Persian force except a combination of Bakhtiaris and Kashgais, which, owing to the jealousy of the two tribes, seems out of the question, could cope with them. The far-reaching consequences of such a departure from our policy of abstention from active intervention exclude Mr. Bill’s proposal Irom consideration, at least until it is shown that Persia, if given such financial assistance as is warranted by the security she has to offer, is unable to re-establish a tolerable measure of order herself. 27. It is, I think, most unfortunate that those responsible for the direction of at!airs shirked the responsibility of applying for financial help to the two Powers until alter the Medjliss met. Money has been most urgently needed, not only in order to enable the Government to deal with the situation in the two provinces of Azerbaijan and Pars, which presents the most threatening outlook, but also to strengthen their authority throughout the country; for I can point to no province where the now more or less latent forces of disorder might not at any moment get beyond the control of the central Government. At present it finds itself in a vicious circle. Without money, it cannot assert its authority, and its feebleness renders it impossible to collect the revenue. The efforts of the provisional Government to obtain money from the Imperial and Russian banks failed as, without the intervention of the two Governments, they were likely to fail, and it was only in the middle of December that the Persian Government took the businesslike course of applying direct to the two Powers. On the 13th December the Ministers of Poreign Affairs and Finances visited the two legations and asked for an immediate advance of 500,000/. for the purpose of restoring order and the introduction of reforms in the administration, especially in the financial department. They offered no security, but the Ministerial programme, which has been approved by the Medjliss, contem plated a later loan for the extinction of the floating debt which would free the customs revenue sufficiently to leave a margin as security for the advance of 500,000/. The pourparlers between London and St. Petersburgh, so far as they have proceeded as yet, do not encourage the hope of an agreement at an early date as to the conditions to be attached to a joint advance. Indeed, at the close of the year, it does not even appear certain that Russia will consent to contributing her share to a joint advance of 400,000/., which is the utmost His Majesty’s Government are willing to join in lending. It is most earnestly to be hoped that the Russian Government will not longer delay a favourable decision on this point and that, over and above such conditions as are aimed at ensuring the proper expenditure of the money, none will be insisted upon to the point of causing a breakdown of the negotiations. Until the new Government is strengthened, we are daily approaching a state of things where we shall find ourselves compelled to abandon our attitude of abstention from active interference. Had the Persian Government been able to get moneys immediately after the revolution, when its prestige was high, it would, I feel confident, have been able, if not interfered with from outside, to consolidate its authority and establish a tolerable state of public order. I cannot speak with the same confidence to-day; still, even to-day, always provided that the Russian chauvinist element is kept out of the game, the chance is good and, in view of the inevitable consequences of a continuance of the present starved conditions, well worth a trial, even though it may not be quite easy for the two Powers to find the money and even though it may not be possible to establish any very perfect supervision of its expenditure. 28. But as just indicated, a postulate of success is a tolerant attitude on the part of Russia, and in this respect the outlook cannot be said to be altogether hopeful. M. Isvolsky has recently stated to Sir A. *Nicolson that the Persian Government was of late adopting, apparently purposely, an irritating attitude towards the Russian Government, and the latter did not consequently feel disposed to be amiable to the former. So far as I know there is no warrant for this statement. It is true that, in the time immediately following the revolution, the committee, a body composed largely of extremists, was led, by the foolish illusion that ridding the country of Mohammad Ali meant freeing Persia from Russian influence, into doing several things which gave umbrage to Russia, such as the appointment of a governor of Azerbaijan, whom they well knew r to be distasteful to her, and the dismissal of M. Smirnow, the Shah’s Russian [330] E14 tutor (who has, however, since been reinstated), but since the dissolution of the com mittee the direction of affairs has been in the hands of those who recognise better the logic of facts, and as far as I know there has lately been no reasonable ground for complaint against the Government, or even the Medjliss which, although there lias been much in the attitude of Russia which might easily be construed as unfriendly—and has indeed been so interpreted in the Persian press—has been kept remarkably quiet M. Isvolsky’s charge against the Persian Government reminds one a little of the fable of the wolf and the lamb, for the silly pin pricks which marked the committee’s administration count as nothing against the real injury, which Persia believes herself to have suffered at the hands of Russia in this country since the revolution. 29. I would here briefly touch on three special grievances against Russia, which are now uppermost in Persian minds:— (1.) The impairment of the Government’s authority by the exaggerated assertion of the privileges of Russian protection, whether enjoyed by “ bastis at the Russian Legation and consulates, or by “ Russian protected persons,” of whom there are far too many. Since the revolution, the attitude of many of the Russian agents in this matter has been such as to lend itself to the construction which is certainly placed upon it by Persians, that whenever the protection is particularly embarrassing to the Persian Government, it is from this very fact the more readily accorded and the more vehemently asserted by the Russian Legation. Two cases occur to me at the moment of writing. There is to -day in “ bast ” at the Russian Legation a man—Sheikh Mahmoud Veramini—whom Mohammad Ali used to employ to collect roughs to overawe the Nationalists. He is the owner of several villages in the neighbourhood of Tehran, and for weeks his villagers were allowed to fly the Russian flag over their houses, and were thus enabled to evade taxation. It is, however, only fair to say that this abuse has been tardily stopped. Another particularly glaring case of abusive “ bast ” is now occurring at Kazvin, where fifty or more refugees from the rising at Zinjan mentioned above have been granted papers of protection by the Russian consul. This is a kind of roving “ bast.” There is no room for them at the consulate, so they can hardly be subjected to proper control by the consul. The danger of a body of malcontents of this kind, who cannot be kept under the close supervision of the consulate responsible for them, and who are nevertheless removed from Persian jurisdiction by the Russian papers of protection, is sufficiently obvious. I had hoped that M. Poklewski would set his face against “bast,’* and when he first arrived he seemed fully to realise the abuses to which it led, hut his attitude novr leaves much to be desired. I have tried to persuade him that “ bast,” unless its privileges are confined within the narrowest limits, is unfair to the Government, but I fear I have made no impression. (2.) Another grievance is the attitude of the Russian consulate-general at Tabreez towards Rahim Khan, to which this brigand chiefs rebellion is generally attributed by Persians. I would not suggest for one moment that the Persians are right in their belief that the Russian agents engineered this rebellion, but it w r as culpably imprudent of M. Miller to send some Russian troops w ith a member of the consular staff to negotiate with a man knowm at the time to be contemplating rebel lion, and still more imprudent of the representative of the consulate-general to allow himself to be photographed hand in hand with Rahim Khan. This photograph was widely circulated, and was calculated to confirm the belief that Russia supported the rascally brigand. This belief was further strengthened by the dispatch from Tabreez of tbe Russian doctor to treat Rahim Khan for facial paralysis. The doctor’s visit apparently cured Rahim Khan, and was immediately followed by the rebellion which has been the most dangerous difficulty the Government has had to face. In the circumstances, the general belief that Rahim Khan, who has given out that he is fighting for Mohammad Ali, enjoys Russian sympathy, is perhaps not to be wondered at. (3.) But the worst grievance of all is the retention of the Russian troops in the near proximity of the capital at Kazvin, though there has never for one moment since the revolution been the slightest danger to foreigners either in the capital or on the Resht road. The presence of these troops at Kazvin is a standing encouragement to opponents of the new rdgime. 30. In the face of these grievances, which in the press and amongst the people are taken as proof that Russia is bent on strangling the life out of the new Govern ment, the wonder is that, considering the vain and emotional character of the Persians, the Government and the Medjliss have kept their heads, and since the days of the committee, done nothing that can fairly be construed as unfriendly to Russia. 31. Of the two Powers, Germany and Turkey, which alone are open to the&gt; 15 suspicion of wishing to invade the monopoly of political influence enjoyed by Great Britain and Russia in Persia, Turkey has been the more active during the past year The presence of the Russian troops in Azerbaijan has served as an incentive not only to the encroachment of Turkish forces upon Persian territory, but also to efforts on the part of the Turkish consular officers in Azerbaijan to increase Turkish infl uence by intrigiie. At Tabreez the Turkish consul-general has lost no opportunity of embarrassing the Russian military authorities in that town. On the arrival of the Russian forces he did his best to stir up an agitation against them, and a few days later welcomed in “ hast ” Sattar Khan and Bagher Khan and a number of their followers, who, as already mentioned, seized the pretext of the foolish intervention of the Russian military authorities in a local quarrel to pose as being in danger from Russian tyranny. There seems little doubt that this demonstration against the presence of the Russian troops was engineered by the Turkish consul-general himself, who apparently took no steps during the “ bast ’ to prevent the most flagrant abuse of Turkish asylum. A public meeting of protest against the Russian occupation was held at the consulate-general, and a telegram from the “ bastis dispatched to the Turkish Parliament begging its help to get rid of the Russians. Although the consul-general did his best to make the “bast” assume formidable proportions, wiser counsels prevailed among the population. The “ bast fell flat and the number of “bastis” diminished, until at the end of June none remained but Sattar and Bagher Khans, who themselves stayed on until the revolution, when they left of their own accord. , . , . , r 32. In Tehran the Turkish chargd d’affaires allowed his embassy to be used tor the purpose of a political demonstration in favour of the constitution b\ gi\ing “ hast ” to some 300 nationalists, who from Christmas 1908 until the restoration of the constitution used the asylum of the embassy for purposes of political intrigue. Whether or not the “bast” was encouraged by Sadr-ed-Bin Bey, as was generally believed, it anyhow gave him an opportunity to intervene with representations in favour of the constitution. Neither the “ bast” nor Sadr-ed-Din’s representations had any effect, and their ill-success served to emphasise the monopoly of political influence enioyed by Great Britain and Russia. ^ # *33. Undoubtedly the most serious feature of Turkish activity has been the continuance of Turkish encroachments in the frontier district, notwithstanding the downfall of the Yildiz regime. Until the Russian troops withdraw from Azerbaijan, there seems little hope of inducing the Porte to keep its forces from overstepping the disputed zone, but wffien the day does come for the withdrawal of the Russian troops it should afford a good opportunity for strong representations to Turkey from the mediating Powers. ^ ^ -mi. 34. There has been no overt political activity on the part of Germany m Tehran, and Count Quadt loses no opportunity of assuring M. Poklewski and me, wuth whom he is on the most friendly terms, that in the political game he is only a spectator. Throughout the constitutional struggle he has kept his gates closed to political “ hast.” I believe also that, when sounded as to financial assistance on Mohammad All’s behalf last spring, he made it perfectly clear that nothing was to be expected from Germany, and he has, moreover, allowed the German Bank concession to lapse. It is true that one cannot avoid the unpleasant suspicion that he is always on the watch for an opportunity to engender discord between the Russian and British Legations ; and during the period when it w'as uncertain whether M. de Hartwig would return, there is good reason to believe that he used his constant intercourse with Mme. de Hartw : ig to this end. But the co-operation of the two legations has been, from M. de Hartwig’s departure, so harmonious that there has, since it was known that he was not returning to Tehran, been no opening for the role of agent provocateur. . . 35. But, although Count Quadt has given no signs of political activity, the year has not been without its German pin-pricks directed at our position in the Gulf. It has been marked bv an increase by two votes in the German voting power on the Sanitary Council at Tehran, Count Quadt having secured the appointment of a German doctor—Ur. Uberg—as delegate for Sweden and for Norway. Neither countrv can be said to have any interests in Persia warranting their acquiring a voice on the Sanitary Council, and there is every reason to believe that the establishment of both posts was due to the initiative of Count Quadt, who by the new appointments finds himself in a stronger position to hamper our sanitary control in the Gulf. . , ^ _ . 36. I should also not omit to mention that the attitude of the German consulate at Bushire, at the time of the rising of the Tangistani Mullah Seyyid Murtezamasquerading as a constitutional champion, was open to serious suspicion. The lawlessness of this fanatical Mullah’s following led, as has already been noticed, to the landing of bluejackets for the protection of foreign lives and property. This step was expressly approved by the German Government, but there is good reason for suspecting the German consulate of having intrigued through its mirza, an intimate friend of the seyyid, to foment an agitation against it. Whether it be true or not. as was asserted at Bushire, that the German consulate actually encouraged the seyyid, the latter was certainly under the impression that he had Germany’s sympathy, and that a German war-ship was coming to Bushire. Indeed, I am assured by a gentleman who has exceptional opportunities of ascertaining the views of the man in the street that the legend that the nationalist champion, Seyyid Murteza, was persecuted by the British and protected by the Germans has been widely circulated, and is freely cited in support of the view which is undoubtedly gaining ground amongst the less enlightened classes that Germany is the true friend ol Persian nationalism and that it is to her that Persia must look to free her from British and Russian influence. II. —Persia’s Foreign Indebtedness. The following tabular statement shows approximately Persia’s foreign debt at the close of the year :— Amount outstanding. 1. Loans from the Russian Government, 1900 and 1902 2. Anglo-Indian loan, 1903 and 1904 3. Debt to Russian Bank .. 4. Debt to Imperial Bank— (a.) Advances, 1901.. .. .. .. •• (b.) Debts of individuals accepted by Persian Government 5. Defalcations of late mint-master from silver supplied by the Imperial Bank for coinage, regarded by the Bank as a debt of the Persian Government, but not yet acknowledged by latter .. £ 3.200.000 300.000 1.200.000 251.000 439.000 315,000 Approximate total .. .. .. .. 5,705,000 No. 1. These loans carry interest at 5 per cent, and are secured on the northern customs, which in case of default Russia is entitled to control and in the last resort to administer. There has been no default. No. 2. The Anglo-Indian loan carries 5 per cent, interest, and should be paid off in twenty annual instalments. It is secured on (1) Caspian Sea fisheries; (2) posts and telegraphs; and (3) the customs of Ears and the Persian Gulf, an expression which is held to include all the southern customs. Both interest and sinking fund are in arrear, the former for two years and the latter for three years. His Majesty’s Government formally consented on certain conditions in 1907 to suspend the sinking funding for two years, and are not pressing for arrears of interest. No. 3 carries interest varying from 5 to 15 per cent.; probably 12 per cent, may be taken as the average. M. *de Hart wig once told Mr. Marling that these various classes of debt were secured on the northern customs in the same manner as the Russian loan. I have reason to doubt this, and probably all that can be said is that by usage such interest as has been paid has come from the northern customs, but the fact is that the Russian hank treated the late Government very tenderly, and interest has been allowed to pile up. With the new regime the Russian attitude has completely changed, and M. Poklewski is now pressing the Persian Government for the consolida tion of the various classes of debt, and for the regular payment of interest from, the northern customs receipts. It is perhaps worth mentioning that amongst the Persian Government’s debts to the Russian Bank is included Mohammad Ali’s personal debt, which was taken over by the Persian Government at the time of the ex-Sbah’s departure. They also include certain debts which have never been formally taken over by the Persian Government. No. 4. Both categories carry 12 per cent, interest. Item (a) was originally secured on the customs of Fars and the Persian Gulf, but by arrangement come to with M. Naus, the interest of these advances and of the rest of the then debt of the Persian Government to the Bank were paid from the Kermanshah customs. Later the Kermanshah receipts were needed for the service of the Russian debt, and in January of last year the Bushire receipts were assigned to the Imperial Bank in their place. From the 21st March a monthly instalment of 30,000 tomans from the Bushirecustoms was to be paid for the service of all the Imperial Bank’s advances. The monthly instalment was sufficient for the time and the Bushire receipts also then were amply sufficient to hear the charge; but since the arrangement was come to, not only have the Bushire receipts fallen off, but by the taking over by the •ate Government of certain debts contracted with the bank by Mohammad Ali Shah .md his uncle, Naib-es-Sultaneh, the indebtedness of the Persian Government to the Bank has considerably increased. The instalment from the Bushire receipts, even if it were regularly paid, which it is not, would no longer suffice, and the legation is pressing for the Mohammerah customs receipts as supplementary security. As the question of facilitating a big loan for Persia has been raised, it seems worth while considering how far the customs revenue would hear further borrowing if the various classes of foreign debt were consolidated, and the exorbitant rate of interest, which certain categories now carry, were reduced to a reasonable level. A consolidation of the above debts to carry interest at a uniform rate of 5 per cent., with a 1 per cent, sinking fund, would involve an annual charge of some 310,000/., so that, at first sight, it would seem that the customs revenue, which amounted to 540,000/. in 1908-9, and shows some increase for the current year, could bear considerable further borrowing, but this revenue has to bear other burdens which have become, so to speak, fixed charges by usage; these amount to some 14)4,000/.:— £ 1. Expenses of the Cossack brigade, which amounted last year to .. 80,000 2. Salaries of foreign Government employes .. .. ., ,. 24,000 3. Expenses connected with the sanitary and coast guard services and other miscellaneous charges .. .. .. .. .. 40,000 Total .. .. .. .. .. 144,000 Besides this, one should, I think, count the ex-Shah’s civil list as a charge on the customs, for otherwise, until things have improved in the Financial Department, it would be impossible to ensure regularity of payment. It will be seen from the above that, even' were a large loan facilitated for the consolidation of the foreign debt, the present customs revenue, unless relieved of some of what I have described as fixed charges by usage, could only bear a further burden of some 30,000/. to 40,000/. a-year. If, as now seems possible, foreigners are to be invited by the Persian Government in the hope of introducing reforms in the administration, their salaries will have to be secured on the customs. Allowing 10,000/. for this, there only remains a margin of from 20,000/. to 30,000/., or just sufficient margin to admit of the augmenting of the debt by 400,000/., which is the sum His Majesty’s Government is now prepared to advance jointly with Russia, subject to conditions which are now under discussion between London and St. Petersburgh. Until, however, the consolidation is effected, it is quite evident that, including those charges which I call fixed charges by usage, the customs revenue is charged up to the hilt, and we must look elsewhere for security for the proposed joint advance of 400,000/. The security which most commends itself to M. Poklewski and me is the minting profits, which amount, I believe, to some 5,000/. a-month. III.— Telegraphs. The two questions which have mainly occupied attention during 1908-9 are :— 1. Exchange of Tehran-Meshed and Meshed-Nasratabad lines. 2. Transfer of Arabistan telegraph lines to the British Government Department, with which is included the extension till 1945 of the concessions held by that Depart ment in Persia. 1. As a result of the Anglo-Itussian Convention, it became necessary to introduce certain modifications into telegraphic arrangements in Persia. In conformity with the principle therein laid down, the two Governments deemed it advisable to modify the position of the Tehran-Meshed and Meshed-Nasratabad lines. On the one hand, it was agreed that the first of these lines, which lay entirely within the region in which Russia was interested, should pass within the competence of the Russian administra tion on the same conditions on which it lay within the competence of the British administration; on the other hand, seeing that a part of the Meshed-Nasratabad telegraph crossed the above-mentioned region, that this line should be divided into [330] Fsections at Khaf, the section to the north of this point lying within the competence of the Russian Administration; and that to the south of the same point within that of the British Administration. This arrangement was embodied as an annexe to, but to be treated as distinct and separate from, the convention. I^rticulars as to our control over the Tehran-Meshed line were supplied to the Russian Government, wlir furnished us with information regarding their control over the Meshed-Kasratabau. section. After correspondence with the India Office it was agreed, with regard to the Khaf-Nasratabad section, that the initial transfer of the Russian obligations should be accepted by the Indian Telegraph Department through its signallers on the spot, but that, for the sake of unity of administration, and on grounds of policy, it should ultimately be vested in the Indo-European Telegraph Department. After an exchange of views between the two Governments, identic instructions were sent to the British and Russian representatives at Tehran to confer together with a view to decide on the best means for obtaining the consent of the Pe&amp;ian Govern ment to the measures contemplated by the arrangement. In view of the feeling at that time in the Persian ^National Assembly, Mr. Marling and M. Hartwig agreed that it would be best to represent the question as one of merely departmental Convenience and economy to be effected without the intervention of the tw r o legations. In the meantime Sir A. Nicolson was instructed to arrange certain details in respect to the transfer wdth the Russian Government. The main point in these discussions concerned the distribution ot signallers. Sir A. Ricolson proposed (March 1908) that, in regard to the Tehran-Meshed section, British operators should have access to the line at the same hours and under the same conditions to which the Russian operators were accustomed. With regard to the Meshed-Nasratabad section, His Majesty’s Government should withdraw' their operators from the section north of Khaf, and the Russian Government do the same for the section south of Khaf. The Russian Government objected to this latter arrangement on the ground that it was not in conformity with article 11 of arrangement of August 1907. His Majesty’s Govern ment recognised that, if it w r ere agreed that both Great Britain and Russia should retain their own signallers at Tehran and Meshed, it would be difficult to claim that Russian signallers should be removed from the terminal stations of the Khaf- Nasratabad line. The Government of India stated that, wdth a view to obviate delay in, and to ensure the correct transmission of, British messages, they were of opinion that the advantages of retaining British signallers to w r ork over the Tehran-Meshed line would outweigh the disadvantages of the retention of Russian signallers at Nasratabad and Khaf. In May 1908 Sir A. Nicolson w r as instructed to inform the Russian Government that His Majesty’s Government had reached the conclusion that the best solution and the one most in conformity with the spirit of the Anglo-Russian Convention would be the complete withdrawal by each Powder of its employ4s from the sphere of the other, and the conclusion of an agreement w hereby each should undertake to instruct its own operators to transmit messages sent by agents of the other, or in the interests of its subjects. The Russian Government, how ever, adhered to the view that it w ould be more equitable to maintain the arrangement originally proposed, but that this arrange ment should be extended to the .Khaf-Nasratabad section. At the same time they put forward the suggestion that each Power should withdraw' all its mechanicians and inspectors, but that Great Britain should retain her signallers at Tehran and Meshed and Russia hers at Birjand and Nasratabad. His Majesty’s Government intimated that they were disposed to agree to the solution of the difficulty on the lines of this latter compromise, w hich approximated to the arrangement preferred by the Govern ment of India. A draft arrangement was accordingly prepared. On the 15th April, 1908, Mr. Marling telegraphed that as the Russian Minister saw no reason for delay in broaching the subject to the Persian Government they proposed to request the telegraph directors to do so at once. On the 30th April, the arrangement was accordingly brought to the notice of the Persian telegraph authorities as a matter of administrative convenience, by General Heisler and Mr. Barker. The Persian Telegraph Administration declined, however, to take the responsibility of acquiescing in the exchange without the sanction of the Cabinet. Assadullah Mirza, Comptroller of the Persian Telegraph Administration, stated that the matter was one of too great importance for his decision and that it should be treated by the two legations with the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The ministerialcrisis which occurred at this moment made further action impossible hut on the reconstruction of the Cabinet the two Russian representatives agreed to mention the matter verbally to Mushir-ed-Dowleh. The question was at this time made the occasion in the Persian press of a violent attack on the Anglo-Russian convention. In September 1908 the acting-Superintendent of Indo-European Telegraph Department sounded the Minister of Telegraphs, but found him unwilling to agree to the arrangement. Since then, though the Russian Government has more than once urged the resumption of negotiations they have remained suspended as it was felt that they mi^ht jeopardise our chances of concluding and obtaining the ratification of the convention regarding the Arabistan telegraphs which forms the subject of the second portion of this memorandum. 2. In May 1907 the Government of India revived the suggestion originally made in 1902 by the Persian Government themselves that in view of the unsatis factory working of the Borasjun-Ahwaz-Mohammerali telegraphs the control of these lines, which lie within the zone rendered neutral by the Anglo-Russian Convention, should be handed over the Indo-European Telegraph Department. In December 1907 Mr. Marling recommended that the first favourable occasion should be taken in order to induce Persian Government to permit the line to be repaired and maintained by the department. The occasion presented itself in August 1908. As a result of complaints received, the Minister of Telegraphs was then being pressed by his Government to provide efficient telegraph lines in Arabistan. He represented that that could not be done unless iron standards were erected on the line and asked his Government to supply funds for the purchase of the iron standards required. To this demand the Persian Government replied that it could not afford to give the money a-sked for. An opportunity for wire-pulling Tvas offered. To get rid of his responsi bilities in the matter, the Minister of Telegraphs approached the Indo-European Telegraph Department with a proposal that they should assume control of the lines. The Indo-European Telegraph Department w r ere accordingly instructed to open nego tiations with a view r to the transfer. It was thought advisable, as in the case of the exchange negotiations, that His Majesty’s Legation should not appear to have any interest in the question, but that it should be treated as a matter of purely ordinary interest by the telegraph departments. The Indo-European Telegraph Department were informed that the Shah desired that the existing wooden posts should be gradually replaced by iron, which would involve a cost of about 6,000/., and it was intimated that the offer to transfer the control would probably be made shortly. Mr. Barker now suggested that this offer of our services in reconstructing and repairing the Arabistan lines might be used for obtaining the prolongation of the British telegraph concessions in Persia up till 1945. Negotia tions on these lines resulted in June in the conclusion, subject to the ratification of the forthcoming Medjliss, of a convention of which the main lines w T ere as follow s :— The Arahistan lines are placed under the control and supervision of the Indo- European Telegraph Department from the date of the agreement until January 1945. His Majesty’s Government agree to pay for the cost of construction and establishment of the Arabistan lines up to 5,000/., and Mso to pay an annual sum of 300/. on account of the maintenance of these lines and the payment of a mechanician up till 1945. Expenses incurred on the lines which may be in excess of the above- mentioned sums shall be refunded gradually to the Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment by the Persian Government. In return, the Persian Government agree to consider the follow ing conventions to be in force and binding up till the 1st January, 1945 :— (1.) Convention of 1868 (Gw r adur-Jask line). (2.) Convention of 1872 (Tehran-Bushire line). (3.) Convention of 1901 (Central Persian line). In case of necessity and with the permission of the Persian Government, the Indo-European Telegraph Department are at liberty to join the lines at their eastern extremity to the Tehran-Bushire line. The Persian Government agree not to employ, without the concurrence of the Indo-European Telegraph Department anyone except Persian subjects or members of the Indo-European Telegraph Department. Further, should the Persian Government wish to extend the Arabistan lines in anv direction, the co-operation of the department in the construction and maintenance of such extension will be asked for. The convention has not yet been submitted for ratification.20 Another question which will have to be arranged with the Persian Government when the Arabistan Convention has been accepted by Medjliss, is the cession to Russia of the British rights over the Tehran-Khanikin line, which was agreed to in return for an assurance from the Russian Government not to raise any objection to the renewal of the British telegraph concessions in Persia. Ikese rights form the subject of article 16 of the convention of 1872 which is to be renewed under the Arabistan Convention so that by the postponement of the session until the latter has been ratified Russia acquires rights which run till 1945 instead of till 1925 only. In April 1908 1,500 tons of red oxide were shipped by Messrs. Strict from the Island of Hormuz to London. It was understood at the legation that Messrs. Strick’s contract with the Moin-ut-Tujjar had expired on the 21st December, 1907, and upon an explanation of this further shipment being asked of His Majesty’s consul- general at Bushire, Messrs. Strick’s agent, Mr. Malcolm, stated that he believed, though he had not been taken into the confidence of the firm, that they had concluded a secret contract with the Moin for another year. Mr. Malcolm at the same time said that the Moin’s position was weak, and that he had been approached by a certain Sadik-ul-Mameiek, who had hopes of wresting the concession from the Moin. He wished Mr. Malcolm to join with him as partner in the capacity of a Persian subject, or, failing that, to be his guarantor as a British subject. Mr. Malcolm had not replied to these overtures, and was urged by Major Cox to do nothing, at any rate until the result of the negotiations for the formation of a company begun by Messrs. Strick and Ellinger at the end of 1907 should be known. During the summer, rumours were current that the Persian Government intended dispossessing the Moin, and the governor of Bushire was, in fact, ordered to obtain offers from local merchants for the lease of the island. It appeared also that the German Legation were making efforts to obtain the concession from the Persian Government, but whatever may have been the aspirations of the German Legation, the Persian Government did not fall in with their wishes in the matter, and it is probable that the rumours of the impending cancellation of the Moin’s concession were occasioned by the Persian Government’s efforts to extract money from the Moin by intimidation. At the end of July the Prime Minister telegraphed to Bushire that the Moin’s concessions were his own, and reports to the contrary were groundless. In view of the urgency of keeping the supply of oxide in British hands, and in order to forestall possible German intrigues in the future, it was decided to support the Moin as far as possible, though, from all that could be gathered from him, it appeared that he had at that time no contracts with any British firms such as would have entitled him to the assurances of support promised to him bv Sir C. Spring-Rice in 1907 (20th July). The negotiations for the formation of the company had not in the meanwhile progressed, as the Moin was unwilling to join, fearing that, were he to do so, we should use our hold over him to influence him in other matters. He was, however, ready to enter into short contracts with Messrs. Strick or any other British firm. The financial straits to which the Shah was reduced during the summer led to a further attempt on the part of his Government to dispossess the Moin, and with this object M. Bizot, the financial adviser, was consulted by the Minister of Finance as to the possibility of raising money by selling the Moin's concession for a term of years. Upon the legation being consulted by M. Bizot upon this, it was explained that such a transaction would be nothing but an advance in disguise, which the Persian Government were debarred from obtaining, except in the conditions stipulated in Sir C. Spring-Rice’s note of the 31st August, 1907 (his despatch No. 196 of 1907). The objections of His Majesty’s Government were similarly explained to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who said he was not aware that such an operation was contem plated, and hinted that the proposal must have emanated from the German Legation. He said that the Shah quite understood what German aims implied, and “ nothing would be given to Germany.” The Russian Minister also promised to remind the Shah of an undertaking which His Majesty had given the previous veaiv IV.—Red Oxide. The Island of Hormuz.that no concessions would be given to Germany without the knowledge and consent of Russia. It was now thought that the best means of safeguarding the Moin’s interests would be the formation of the projected company between him and Messrs. Ellinger nd Strict. It^ was, however, found impossible to carry out this scheme, as the oerms which Rllinger were able to offer to Strict were made impossible by the Moin, who was averse to the proposal, fearing that once the company was formed, His Majesty’s Government would be lukewarm in his support, as, were he dispossessed, the company would remain unaffected, and would continue to w r ork under the new con- cessionnaire. At the end of 1908 Messrs. Ellinger signed a contract for three years with Messrs. Andrew Weir for the sale of Hormuz oxide. After the overthrow of the Shah’s Government in the summer of 1909, it was again rumoured that the Moin was about to be dispossessed of his concessions. In view of the contract held by Messrs. Weir, the Persian Government were warned that His Majesty’s Government must insist on the maintenance of this contract. Messrs. Strict, upon hearing that the concession might possibly come into the market, opened negotiations, through their Tehran agent, for its acquisition. These negotiations were, however, suspended pending the meeting of the Medjliss, since which they have been resumed. It should be mentioned that a report was received in the autumn of the year that the Moin was in negotiation with the Germans, but upon enquiries being made of the Moin, he emphatically denied having bad any dealings with them. The Island of Sirri. The discovery of red oxide on the Island of Sirri is comparatively recent, and it was not until the spring of 1908 that Messrs. Haji Ali Atbar, of Manchester, intimated to His Majesty’s Government their desire to obtain a concession for its exploitation from the Persian Government. It was not possible for His Majesty’s Government to give Messrs. Haji Ali Akbar their entire support in their plan, as the territorial ownership of Sirri is disputed, the island being claimed by Persia and by the Jowasmi Sheikh of Shargah, who is under British protection. In 1888 it was occupied by the Persian Government. His Majesty’s Government protested at the time, and, although they refrained from taking forcible action on behalf of the Sheikh of Shargah, they have never admitted the pretentions of the Persian Government. Had His Majesty’s Government supported Messrs. Haji Ali Akbar in seeking a concession from the Persian Government, such action would have been tantamount to a recognition of Persian sovereignty over the island. It was accordingly decided, while not supporting the British company, to inform it that His Majesty’s Govern ment wmuld not oppose it, and to address a note to the Persian Government stating that if a concession were granted to any applicant not approved by His Majesty’s Government the question of the territorial status of Sirri would forthwith be reopened. A note in this sense w T as presented to the Persian Government in December, as it was understood that the firm had put in their application for a concession. Subsequently Messrs. Strick expressed the desire to obtain a concession to work oxide on the Islands of Sirri, Little Tamb, and Nabiyu Farur, and on other islands not expressly specified. The Moin-ut-Tujjar, upon learning that efforts were being made to obtain oxide concessions in the Gulf, represented that his general firman from the Persian Government covered ali the islands in the Persian Gulf. He was, however, unable to produce any document in whicli Sirri Island was mentioned, and he was considered by His Majesty’s Government as unable to establish his claim as holder of a con cession on the island. It was, however, not possible to support Messrs. Strick’s application in view r of the assurance to Messrs. Haji Ali Akbar that His Majesty’s Government would not oppose their application. It was therefore thought best that, if Messrs. Strick wished to go on with their scheme, they should appoint an agent in Tehran, whom it would be possible for the legation to help so far as was consistent with the undertakings of His Majesty’s Government to Messrs. Haji Ali Akbar. This proposal was carried out, and in March 1909 Mr. Brown, of the Imperial Bank of Persia, was appointed their agent, and it is he who is now r conducting: the negotiations with the Persian Government for the Hormuz concession in the event of [339] Gof the Moin’s rights being cancelled. He is empowered to offer 40,000/. down and an annual rent of 2,000/. a-year for mining rights on all the Persian islands in the Persian Gulf. Y.—The Persian Gulf Quarantine Service and Sanitary Matters, 1908. The year 1908 saw the completion of the proper equipment of the Persian Gulf quarantine service by His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. There is now a mobile assistant to the chief quarantine officer at Bushire, always in readiness at Kurrachee to start for the Gulf when need arises ; at his disposal there is a portable disinfecting stove. A Clayton apparatus for disinfecting ships has been placed at Bushire, in addition to the stove already there, and stoves have been supplied to the four other quarantine posts at Bunder Abbas, Lingah, Task, and Mohammerah. A further stove has also been placed at Bahrein. The lazarets at the different quarantine stations still leave much to be desired, but in a hot climate like that of the Persian Gulf extra accommodation can always be provided in the shape of tents and shelters. The financial position of the Persian Government does not allow of improvement being made in this respect. The quarantine service, regarded as an outpost for the defence of Europe against plague and cholera, has thus been greatly strengthened; moreover, the necessity for a sentinel quarantine station at the entrance of the Persian Gulf, as advised by the International Sanitary Conference at Paris in 1903, and against which such urgent political and commercial objections can be raised, has been obviated. In addition, the present arrangement can deal much more effectually with the difficulty of the small-boat traffic during an epidemic than could a single station on either of the islands of Hormuz or Henjam. It is always possible, however, that this question of a sentinel station may yet again be raised by countries jealous of the British predominant position in the Gulf. It seems more likely at present, however, that international control of the quarantine service is, and will continue to be, the object of German activity in the Persian Gulf, as shown by the incidents now to be described and by past incidents. International Incidents in the PersianGulf were this year limited to the actions of the German consulate at Bushire. The change in the attitude of the Russian representatives towards British interests and administration was nowhere more marked than here. Hr. Listemann, the German consul, has consistently attacked the quarantine service whenever possible, and has been invariably backed up by his legation at Tehran. One of his first actions was to obtain the assistance of Hr. Bussi^re (a gentleman with a long record of unfriendly acts towards British interests, nominally the doctor of the Erench consulate, but also at one time in Russian and Belgian pay, and a spy on the quarantine administration) in making a general attack on the quarantine arrange ments, based on the report of Hr. Paul Eaivre to the Erench Government, in which the establishment of a sentinel quarantine station is advised. Hr. Listemann’s report was communicated to his legation at Tehran. In April a second incident took place, showing that the German consul and Hr. Bussi&amp;re were acting together against the quarantine administration. Some dead rats were found at Bahrein, where epidemics of plague are frequent. Major Prideaux, the political agent, at once made investigations, found that there was no reason to suspect the existence of plague (the rats had been caught in a trap), and at once informed the chief quarantine officer at Bushire. Simultaneously a letter on the same subject was received by the latter from the director of customs at Bushire, adding that Hr. Bussiere had asked him to telegraph the news confidentially to the president of the Sanitary Council at Tehran. It turned out that Dr. Bussidre had got his information from Hr. Listemann, who had received a letter from the agent of a German firm at Bahrein. Neither the consul nor Hr. Bussi&amp;re took the usual and straightforward course of communicating with the chief quarantine officer ; they both hoped to discredit the quarantine service in the eyes of the Sanitary Council. His Majesty’s resident in the Persian Gulf at once communicated with the legations on the subject of the conduct of Hr. Bussiftre. In the end, as the result of action taken at Tehran, Hr. Bussiere received strict orders from the Erench and Russian Legations to desist from interference with quarantine matters. This he promised to do. _ # . The next incident in the German consul’s systematised campaign against the quarantine service was that of the steara-ship “Galicia,’ which ran aground off Bushire, and was boarded by the German agent before the quarantine officer hadmade Lis visit. The latter very properly protested, whereupon Dr. Listemann proceeded to faire la bete in a correspondence with the chief quarantine officer. The German Minister supported him, and wrote a letter to the Sanitary Council in which he accused Captain Williams of rudeness, of misapplying the Convention of Paris, of threatening physical force, and of acting ultra vires. He also fell hack on ancient history by reviving the incident of the steam-ship (t Savoia,” which had been dealt with by the Sanitary Council in the previous year. The council’s reply w r as a vindica tion of Captain Williams’s action. As a result of this incident it was decided to draw up local quarantine rules for the Persian Gulf. This has not yet been done. The Sanitary Council. —Dr. Coppin, the president, was absent in Europe during the greater part of the year. Eokman-el-Mamalek, the Shah’s Persian physician, who was elected vice-president at the beginning of the year, took his place, and proved capable and friendly to British interests. It was while he w T as acting as president that the German attack on the quarantine service was made. Epidemics .—Both cholera and plague broke out in the Hedjaz during the return “ hadj.” No infected ships, however, reached the Persian Gulf. Plague appeared at Bagdad in May, and the Persian authorities formed a quaran tine post at Kasri Shirin. Cholera broke out at Tabreez in October, but did not spread. It was said to have been imported from the Caucasus. This was after the siege had been raised. Baku w as visited by cholera in September, and quarantine wras imposed on vessels from that port by the Persian authorities by the advice of the Sanitary Council. The liussian Government, however, protested, and forced the Persian Government to raise the quarantine. This fact is mentioned, for shortly afterwards the Russian delegate on the Sanitary Council made the interesting statement that unless the quarantine arrangements on the Caspian were improved his Government would take them into its own hands. V a.— The Persian Gulf Quarantine Service and Sanitary Matters, 1909. There is little to note for the year 1909 in connection with the Persian Gulf quarantine service, the efficiency of which was so much increased in 1908. The “ Clayton apparatus ” for disinfecting ships was after some discussion placed at Bushirc. Mohammerah, where there is a sheltered port, would have been more suitable, but the hardship entailed in going [to the farthest corner of the Gulf for disinfection would have led to protests by foreign Powers and a revival of the question of a sentinel station. ,, Two small epidemics of plague were successfully dealt with, one on board the steam-ship “ Dumra ” from Bombay, the other in the islands of Bahrein. The activities of the doctor of the French consulate—Dr. Bussi&amp;re—as a tool in the hands of foreign nations (Russia and Belgium formerly, Germany recently) who wdsh to have a share in the quarantine administration were brought to an end by his withdrawal from Persia. His successor has received very clear instruc tions from the French Government not to meddle with quarantine matters. War-ships in the Persian Gulf are in future not required to have quarantine guards placed on board. The customs official at Bunder Abbas has drawn attention to the increased expenses of the quarantine post there. The Persian Government has so far not done more than bring the matter to the notice of the sanitary council, which replied that it was a question for the Persian Government and His Majesty’s Legation to settle. Captain Williams, I.M.S., who for more than three years has very ably fulfilled the duties of chief quarantine officer, returned to India in November. He has been succeeded by Captain McConaghey, I.M.S., late residency surgeon at Bagdad. International Incident. —The German Legation has once more attacked the quarantine administration in the Persian Gulf. At the sixty-eighth meeting of the sanitary council a letter was read from Count Quadt in which he made four sugges tions, all implying that the quarantine service as at present constituted is inefficient. The president was able to give a very complete reply on behalf of the council, and no more has been heard of the matter. A copy of the German Minister’s letter, with criticisms on the points raised, will be found in Sir George Barclay’s despatch to the Foreign Office, “No. 22, Commercial,” of the 17th September, 1909. The Sanitary Council. —Dr. Coppin (France) as president has always acted in a friendly manner towards British interests. A marked feature in the proceedings of the council has been the increasing prominence taken by the Persian members in24 discussion, and their aliveness to Persian interests. This is to be connected with the election to the council of several young natives who have studied medicine in Europe, and with the spread of the spirit of nationalism. In January a project was drawn up by the council, for the formation of a budget of its own, by the collection of taxes on pilgrims and corpses on their way to tin holy places. Such taxes already exist, but they are not fixed, and are pocketed by local officials. The Council of Ministers gave its assent to the council s proposals, but disturbed conditions have so far prevented their being carried out. In connection with the epidemic of cholera in Russia, the necessity of a quarantine service for Northern Persia was discussed at the sixty-fourth meeting of the council. The hope was openly expressed that the Russian Government would do on the shores of the Caspian Sea what His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India have done in the Persian Gulf. At a later meeting, however, the president announced that the Persian Government had agreed to find funds for the purpose, and at the seventy-second meeting a scheme was presented by a commission formed of members of the council. The Persians present insisted strongly that the personnel of the proposed quarantine service must be Persian. Conditions are too unsettled at the end of the year to make speculation on the future of this scheme prod table. Sufficient is it to say that, should it mature, the question of quarantine fees will come up and will consequently be raised in connection with the Persian Gulf. Also that there are not enough natives competent to carry on a serious quarantine service. The doctor of the German Legation, the senior of the two German members of the council, has during the year been made the representative of both Norway and Sweden. The Norwegian consul-general at Tehran is a German; his vice-consul at Bushire is also a German. Sweden has a representative at Tehran (a British subject), hut not at Bushire. This is the first time that these countries have been represented on the council. Though it would appear that each member has up to the present used only one vote, there can be little doubt that this is a further move on the part of the German Legation to strengthen its powers of interference in matters connected with the Persian Gulf quarantine service. Epidemics directlv affecting Persia appeared—of plague—at Jeddah, Bagdad, and in the Persian Gulf'as already noted. A few fatal cases occurred in the lazaret at Bushire, landed from the steam-ship “ Dumra.” The epidemic of cholera in Russia spread to Baku and Russian Astara, and in November reached Persian Astara. Quarantine w r as imposed by the Persian Government on ships calling at Astara, Enzeli, and Bender Gez from infected places. These ports have none of the materiel which quarantine stations should have. With reference to the appointment of the doctor of the German Legation to be the first representative of both Norway and Sweden on the sanitary council, the following facts may be added :— 1. In a despatch to Sir E Grey, dated the 15th October, 1909, Mis Majesty’s Minister at Christiania stated that the Norwegian Eoreign Minister was unable to tell him “ by what influence Mr. Bonati, the Norwegian consul-general (at Tehran), had been appointed, and that it was apparently through his nomination, and not through that of the Norwegian Foreign Office, that Dr. Ilberg had been appointed Norwegian representative on the board ” (the sanitary council). 2. The Swedish consul-general at Tehran informed Sir George Barclay (despatch to Foreign Office, “ No. 2, Commercial,” of the 28th January, 1910) that Dr. Ilberg had asked through the German Legation for the appointment, and that alter com munication between Stockholm and Berlin it was made. YI.—Roads. State of Southern Roads. The insecurity of the, southern trade routes has, during the past year, probably been greater than'at any period in the recent history of Persia. The sections of road most affected have been Ispahan-Yezd-Kerman, Kerman-Bunder Abbas, ispahan- Shiraz and Shiraz-Bushire. In Kerman, for instance, the road between the capital of the province and the coast was for some time during the summer so completely interrupted that imported necessities of life, such as tea and sugar rose to famine prices. The Yezd-Kerman road has been frequently blocked by robbers for weekstogether, though the closing months of the year saw an improvement on this route owing to the strong rule of Sardar Jang at Yezd and of Kawam-ul-Mulk at Kerman, appointments made by Sardar Assad after the revolution. But the worst of all has been the Bushire-Jspahan route, sections of which during most of the year have been exposed to constant outrages at the hands of robbers belonging to the Kuhgelu and other tribes with whom the central Government has throughout the year shown itself powerless to deal. In former years foreigners travelling on the southern trade routes were generally considered comparatively immune against armed robbery; but in the year under consideration, in spite of all the precautions taken, no less than four instances occurred between March and August where British subjects were robbed and molested, while the Russian consul-general at Bushire was attacked in November near Shiraz, in spite of his being accompanied by an escort of Russian Cossacks, and at the end of December was still unable to proceed to bis post. In all the cases the marauders have remained unpunished. In Ears alone the ever-growing list of foreign claims lor goods robbed on the trade routes has risen in 1909 from 40,609 to 57,063 tomans. Hie “wilful damage” account of the Indo-European Telegraph Department is already double last year’s total (1st Eebruary, 1908-lst February, 1909), the telegraph gholams have been repeatedly robbed and maltreated while on repairing duty, and the line itself has, in consequence, been threatened with total interruption. The immunity from interference owing to local disturbance hitherto generally enjoyed by the Department’s lines now, in fact, appears to be a thing of the past. The serious aspect of the present state of things is reflected in the trade of Bushire, and is especially felt by British interests. Under the existing conditions and dangers attending transport from Bushire to Ispahan, a volume of British and British Indian trade, which, in the year 1907-8, was estimated at 1,200,000/., has, during Die year under notice, received a most damaging check, so much so, that most cl the British firms have practically ceased to do business, while some of them are preparing to close their Bushire branches. In addition to being exposed to the depredations of robber tribes, caravans on the Bushire-Shiraz sections have been forced to pay the illegal “ rahdari ” and local dues for so-called protection far in excess of previous years. To give but three instances : the sum of 15 krans is levied per mule from Kazerun to Bushire, some 97 miles; 5 krans per mule is levied for the section of the road Daliki-Bushire, a distance of 55 miles, and 1 kran per mule is levied at the gate of Bushire by the “ kalentar,” a municipal official. In these circumstances, it is scarcely a matter of surprise that a dearth of transport should arise on the road, and that the number of mules employed along the Bushire-Shiraz section—which was, in 1905, estimated at from 5,000 to 7,000—should have, in 1909, fallen to between 2,000 and 3,000, and that^ consequently, the price of transport which, in the former year, varied between 85 and 100 krans per load of 737 lb. for a distance of 185 miles (Bushire-Shiraz), should now have risen to between 200 and 300 krans. To give one further proof of the extent to which British trade is embarrassed, insurance, which formerly was accepted at the rate of 15s. per 100/., rose in 1907 to 30s., in 1908 to 46s., and in the present year, in April, rose to war rates—viz., 5/. to 10/.—for the same sum. The Bakhtiari road, comparatively satis factory though its state has been, is not yet in a position to remedy the deficiencies of a route which has been used since time immemorial, and which, moreover, passes through towns and districts which have always been associated with the trade of the country, and are minor distributing centres; and the condition of the main route in the south from Bushire to Ispahan places British trade at a great disadvantage as compared with Russian goods coming in through the safer routes in the north. The question of the policing of the Shiraz road has accordingly become urgent, in October 1908 Messrs. H. 0. Dixon, of Manchester, addressed both the Foreign Office in London and His Majesty’s consul-general at Ispahan and, in calling attention to the serious state of affairs that had arisen, suggested, in the one case, that Indian troops, in the other that gholams of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, should be employed to police the road. His Majesty’s consul-general at Ispahan and the British acting consul at Shiraz were instructed to give their observations regarding Messrs. Dixon’s proposals, and both agreed that there was a general feeling amongst British merchants that the steps taken with regard to robberies committed against British trade on the Bushire road had ceased to be adequate, and that it had consequently become desirable that His Majesty's Government should consider what other measures they might be prepared to take in the interests of British trade in Persia. Mr. Bill expressed the opinion that, whereas [339] H26 former outbursts of lawlessness were due to local causes, such as the intrigues of powerful personages to discredit one another, or intertribal feuds, the reason of the present trouble was far more deepseated, and was due to the fact that the nomad tribes now fully realised that the Persian Government was powerless to punish them. He suggested, as a tentative measure, that the road should be policed by bodie*' of gholams belonging to the Telegraph Department, who should move along the line, ascertaining the movements of the robbers and summoning by telephone reinforcements if necessary; and that caravans should be escorted by these gholaras at fixed rates, according to the proportion of mules to each man of the escort. Mr. Bill’s proposal was approved by His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and he was directed to elaborate the scheme be had outlined. In furnishing these details Mr. Bill stated as his opinion that the employment of British troops would be preferable as regards the immediate question, but this not being possible, he suggested as an alternative that a force should be raised among the local tribes, numbering some 230 men, under the orders of three British officers, and divided into three sections, the estimated yearly cost of the force being under 8,000/. He deprecated as likely to be ineffective any system of subsidies to native chiefs, such as obtains on the North-West Frontier of India, The visit of His Majesty’s resident at Bushire to Tehran in the middle of November gave an opportunity for further discussion of the situation and suggesting what steps might be taken to remedy it. A scheme was submitted to His Majesty’s Government modifying Mr. Bill’s proposals by which the Indo-European Telegraph Department was to second six officers who were to raise locally, organise, and superintend a force of 600 road-guards to patrol the road by sections, small subsidies being paid to certain chieftains on the Bushire-Shiraz section. The cost of the scheme was estimated not to exceed 15,000/. a-year, which was to be met for a given period, say three years, by a surcharge of 10 per cent, on import and export duties at the Persian ports of the Gulf. Both His Majesty’s Minister and Major Cox agreed that British traders would be unlikely to object as it might be expected that the illegal charges and enhanced transport rates might be expected to cease if the scheme met with success. ’Phis scheme remains for the present in abeyance pending the result of the negotiations in regard to the proposed joint Anglo-Russian advance to the Persian Government, one of the conditions attached to which will be, it is hoped, the forma tion of an armed force under foreign instructors for the protection of the roads. At the close of the year the state of this road was worse than ever and Mr. Bill pointed out that the proposed scheme for policing it with telegraph gholams was quite inadequate and advocated a British punitive expedition against the Boir Ahmed is, who had latterly been conspicuous in the pillaging upon the route, and had acquired thereby dangerous wealth and prestige. Bakhtiari Road. The year 1909 has been one of great importance for the Lynch Road between Ahwaz and Ispahan, and events have shown the benefits to British trade of having an alternative trade route from the south which is controlled by one tribe, to whom it is of direct interest that a safe means of communication should be kept open. Owing to the chronic state of disorder on the Bushire-Ispahan Road during the whole of the year, trade became diverted to the Karun, and the volume of traffic w r hich passed between Ahwaz and Ispahan is estimated for the past twelve months as having been some five times greater than in any previous year since the construction of the road. This satisfactory state of things was, however, not reached without repeated warnings being addressed to the Khans. During the month of May, when there appeared to be a considerable probability that the Shah would take the offensive against the Bakhtiari Khans at Ispahan, Samsam-es-Sultaneh declared that he could not be responsible for order being maintained, asserting that the Muhtasham faction of the tribe were endeavouring to make trouble with the object of embarrassing him, and that it was out of his power to prevent the depredations of a section of the Kuhgelu tribe, whose territory abutted on one portion of the road, but w 7 ho belonged to the government of Ears and were, consequently, out of his jurisdiction. Traffic was in tact temporarily suspended for some weeks during May and June but, thanks to the representations made by His Majesty’s consular officers at Ispahan and Ahwaz to the Khans, who were told that both factions w r ould be held jointly responsible for any robberies or losses that might take place, communications were reopened towards the end of June. The difficulty as regards the Kuhgelus was arranged, in themonth of September, by the governorship of the tribesmen concerned being undertaken by the Bakhtiari Khans. The generally improved conditions on the road have also been reflected in the conciliatory attitude of the Khans as regards claims against them. In September Lieutenant flanking reported that all outstanding cases had been settled with the exception of the 1901 Godar Bridge repair claim, which they had hitherto declined to consider, but which they now appeared disposed to discuss. Lieutenant Ranking asked that power should be given him to negotiate with the Khans, on the basis of the payment of the principal of the sum due for the repairs in question, Messrs. Lynch forgoing the interest. He was subsequently authorised to treat on these terms, and news of the result of bis negotiations is shortly to be expected. Further, at the end of October, at the express request of the Khans, Messrs. Lynch despatched their road engineer into the Bakhtiari country to report on the state of the bridges and a word of praise here seems due to the patience and tact exercised both by Captain Lorimer and by his successor Lieutenant Ranking in their dealings with the Khans. Both these gentlemen appear to have done much towards allaying the feeling that had been aroused among these somew r hat ignorant mountain chieftains by misunderstandings in connection with the road which have arisen during past years. VII.— British Claims. In view of the disorganisation of the central and provincial Governments little progress was made during 1908 and 1909 towards a settlement of the numerous outstanding British claims in Persia, and, owing to the state of anarchy which has almost uninterruptedly existed on the trade routes of the south, British claims in respect of road robberies have considerably increased. The principal claims that have been settled during the past year are : That for 907.000 krans, being the consignments of money belonging to the Imperial Bank of Persia which were seized by the Ain-ed-Dowleh near Tabreez at the end of 1908 and the beginning of 1909, repayment being effected by a lien on the Bushire customs; and (2) Dr. Lindley’s claim against the Persian Government for 100,000 krans, mentioned in the yearly report for 1907, which has now been wound up. As regards claims mentioned in the report for 1907, the position is as follows Messrs. Ziegler: Robbery of Mr. Sothan’s gun near Veramin in 1905 ; 1,500 krans. Outstanding. Rice Robbery (Ispahan claim): Partially settled ; 2,716 krans. Outstanding. Stileman Robbery (Ispahan claim) : 14,886 krans. Outstanding. Attack on Steam-ship “ Shushan ” ; 10,663 krans. No progress. Running Expenses of Steam-ship “Shushan’': 1,295,128 krans. As usual, repudiated by Persian Government in 1909. Robbery of Legation Gholam : Between Tehran and Ispahan in 1907 ; 2,680 krans. Not pressed lately. Messrs. Stevens (Tabreez claim): For £T. 300, lost in post near TTrumia. Liability admitted, but no compensation yet paid. Cawnpore Mills: Claims for 218 rupees and 647 rupees. Outstanding. Messrs. Ziegler (Bushire claim): For goods robbed at Sandgaj on Bunder Abbas- Yezd road ; 41/. 4s. Outstanding. Bar Kane, of Srinagar (Bushire claim): Kashmir shawl robbed in post; 4.000 rupees. Outstanding, being pressed. British and Bible Society's Colporteur (Ispahan claim) : Robbery of 5,628 krans. Outstanding. Damage done by “bastis” to His Majesty's Consulate-General, Ispahan, in 1907 (Ispahan claim) : 4,660 krans. Little prospect of recovery. Dayir attack on Fath-ul-Rahman (ftwshATQ claim): Dates from 1904 ; 4,050 rupees. Outstanding. Persian Government state they are continuing enquiry. The following new claims were put forward by His Majesty’s legation in 1908 and 1909 respectively and are also outstanding :— 1908. 1. Telegraph Gholam: Robbed'near Kumishah ; 932 krans. 2. Mr. Nash’s Robbery : Near Dehshir; 1,823*50 krans.28 3. Messrs. Blockley. Cree and Co. (Kermanshah claim): Robbery near Bisxtun; 1,240 krans. 4. Mr. Nash’s Travelling Expenses: 1,087 krans. 5. Bahreinis Robbed near Yezd (Yezd claim): 5,255 krans. 6. Yezd Telegraph Office: Damaged by “ bastis ” ; 505 krans. 7. Persian Transport Company: Toll-house damaged near Kasr-i-Dokhter; 3,227 krans. 8. Dahaneh Telegraph Office : Damaged by Afghans ; 3,607*65 krans. 9. Castelli (Tabreez claim) : Dor carpets seized by Rahim Khan; 175,000 krans. 10. Persian Transport Company : Tea-shop on Kurn road plundered; 984 krans. 1909. 11. Bahreinis Robbed near Yezd (Yezd claim connected with (5) ) ; 1,773. 12. Zieglers Losses near Taireejs (Tabreez claim): Through depredations of Rahim Khan; 16,835 krans. 13. Afghan Pilgrims (Kermanshah claim): Robbed near Kermanshah ; balance due 12,229 krans. 14. Mr. Gentleman (Shiraz claim) : Robbery near Sivend; 9,300 krans. 15. Lynch’s employe : Attacked near Kum by Bakhtiaris; 393 krans. 16. Mr. Casey : House in Tehran plundered during revolution ; 60,186 krans. 17. Imperial Bank of Persia ; Defalcations of Mint master, recorded by the bank as a debt of the Persian Government, but not yet acknowledged by them; 1,588,726 krans. 18. Abraham, of Indo-European Telegraph Department (Ispahan claim) : Robbery at Nizamabad; 22,162 krans. 19. Mr. Wright (Shiraz claim): Robbery at Rafsinjan ; 51,640 krans. 20. Indo-European Telegraph Department: Damage done to building during revolution; 3,217 krans. 21. Mr. Nanajan Rizzo : House plundered during revolution; 12,000 krans. The Persian Government deny responsibility, alleging force majeure, in the case of the claims of Mr. Casey, the Indo-European Telegraph Department, and Mr. Nanajan Rizzo, for losses sustained during the revolution in Tehran. This plea has not been admitted. The claim for compensation in connection with the Taona murders case is not included above, as, though the case is before the Persian Government, no actual sum has been claimed. One of the alleged murderers was captured during the summer, but the proceedings are not concluded. According to His Majesty’s resident at Bushire, 1,000/. should be demanded. A claim of 30,987 krans against Ala-es-Sultaneh 'on the part of certain London tradesmen for goods supplied, is likewise not included. His Highness alleges the goods were bought, in reality, on behalf of the late Muzaffer-ed-Din Shah. The Persian Government have been informed that, in default of payment by Ala-es- Sultaneh, they will be held responsible. In order to gain some idea of the claims presented by His Majesty’s consulates to the local authorities in respect of road robberies, &amp;c., statements were called for from the consular officers, and it appears that the total claims amount to close on 30,000/., of which considerably more than half appertain to Bushire and Shiraz. Of course this does not include claims against individual Persians in the Persian courts, some of which will doubtless finally form the subject of representations to the Persian Government. Though not properly to be included in the list of claims, it may be convenient to give the following table, showing the indebtedness of the Persian Government to the Imperial Bank of Persia on the 31st December, 1909 :— Krans. 1.

The change is in a large degree due to the action of the monopolist, Haji Kazim Tabriz!, in becoming a Russian subject. Thus the Russian Legation, who were formerly his principal persecutors, are now the chief upholders of his monopoly, and have forbidden the exportation through Russia of all guts except those bearing Haji Kazim’s mark, whereas before Haji Kazim changed his nationality they prohibited the exportation through Russia of all guts bearing Haji Kazim’s mark. This change in the monopolists position enables Mr. Stevens to carry out his contracts with him. The other British subject interested in this question, Mr. Lewis, has made his own arrangements with the monopolist. He himself has what practically amounts to a monopoly in Tehran and Isfahan, having made contracts with all the butchers in those towns for the purchase of all their guts. He has also numerous contracts in various other towns in the provinces. His profits have been affected by the formation of a meat monopoly in Tehran, from which foreign subjects are excluded, but he came to terms with the monopolists, though he professes that the enhanced price of guts, due to the formation of the monopoly, has caused him a loss of 10,000/. Owing to the intervention of His Majesty’s' Legation the monopolist has agreed to pay him 3,100 tomans compensation, but this sura has not as vet been paid to him. IX.— Karun Irrigation and Sheikh op Mohammerah. 1. No development in the irrigation scheme occurred from the date of the 1907 annual report until, in December 1908, the Sheikh of Mohammerah was informed, in reply to an enquiry as to the present state of the case, that there had been no change. 2. In January 1909, however, the legation learnt that a Dutch syndicate had obtained an option for an irrigation concession. As this was granted just after the accession to office of Saad-ed-Dowleh, who had been in “bast” at the Dutch Legation for six months, the inference that it was the result of some private arrangement then arrived at seems not unjustifiable, and his Excellency, upon being questioned on the subject, stated that the late Dutch Minister, then on leave in Europe, had been given a two years’ option for the concession, the details of which were to be arranged in subsequent negotiations. 3. The document alluded to a tl concession d’exploitation a Ahwaz/' and it was [339] Ttherefore thought wiser to remind!the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sir 0. Spring- Rice’s note of the 24th October, 1906, which was as follows :— “ It has come to the knowledge of His Majesty’s Government that a scheme is under consideration having for its object the concession of extensive rights to a foreign company in the neighbourhood of Ahwaz for the purpose of constructing and operating irrigation works on the Karun. “ The Persian Government are well aware of the interests possessed by British subjects in the district of the Karun which have indeed been the subject of special orders and of direct encouragement of His Majesty the late Shah and of lengthy correspondence between the Governments. “ A project of the character above stated is evidently calculated to introduce a very con siderable change, both commercial and political, in the existing situation on the Karon, and, while expressing its sincere sympathy with all projects of a nature to develop the resources of Persia, this legation is instructed to state that in view of the friendship which so happily subsists between the Governments of the King and the Shah, Sir E. Grey is confident that no definite step will be taken in the matter above mentioned without previous communication to His Majesty’s Government.” 4. Saad-ed-Dowleh was further informed that the above warning having been disregarded, His Majesty’s Government reserved their right to take objection to the schemo. In reply, the Persian Government admitted that His Majesty’s Government would have the right to object to anything contrary to their interests, and promised to take suitable measures to remove such objections. 5. It was reported from the Gulf that there was something more definite than a mere option which had been granted; but, on enquiry at The Hague, His Majesty’s Government were informed by the Netherlands Government that the option which had been granted was of a vague and undefined character, and that should a Dutch syndicate receive a concession for works near the Karun, a timely warning would be given that no work could be undertaken wdthout the assurance of support from His Majesty's Government and the co-operation of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. 6. The question was then raised by the sheikh, who begged Major Cox to reiterate and press on his behalf his former request for a loan to finance a not too ambitious scheme of irrigation himself, to be worked for him by a suitable British syndicate. He further desired to telegraph to the Persian Government and the Shah that the Arabs were disturbed at the rumours of a foreign irrigation concession, and would not agree to it. In reply, His Majesty’s Government advised him to refrain from making any communication at the moment. 7. In March Sir W. Will cocks went to Mohammerah to examine on the spot the question of irrigating those regions, and his views were to the following effect:— By restoring the dam at Nahr Hashem on the Kerkha the whole country between the Turkish border and the Karun from Harnizek to the Shat-el-Arab—some 750,000 acres—could be irrigated. Nahr Hashem itself is claimed by Nizam-es- Sultaneb, hut the Arabs of the district affected are under the Sheikh of Mohammerah. Such creeks as the scheme required could be dug by the tribesmen, and the initial cost would be 250,000/. Later, it w r ould be sufficient if one European and a few Indians were retained to supervise. By such a scheme it would be possible for a railway down the right bank of the Karun to pay well, and when such a railway was built there would be less objection to interference with the navigation of the Karun. 8. Irrigation from the Karim would require a regulating weir at Ahwaz and 1,000,000 acres to the east of the river would be affected. Should it be necessary, the River Jerrahi could also be used, giving some 500,000 more acres, and if the Kerkha were found to be insufficient, a canal to the west of the Karun could supplement it. The scheme would probably cost 500,000/. Until the date gardens on the Shat-el- Arab are provided with silt by the irrigation works—eight years hence—they would suffer greatly from the Karun being used for irrigation. The soil found on the upper half of the Karun is very good, and that on the lower half could be rendered the same. 9. Upon the strength of these views His Majesty’s Government decided to negotiate with the sheikh. 10. In March Major Cox was instructed to proceed to Mohammerah to see thesheikh. The latter was much exercised about the Nationalist movement. He feared that if he sided with the wrong party (and both sides were bringing pressure to bear upon him) in the constitutionalist struggle, we might seize the excuse to withdraw our guarantees. He therefore wished for definite assurances of help from His Majesty’s Government. 11. Eventually he gave Major Cox guarantees as regards the Karun irrigation scheme, or any possible schemes for irrigation from rivers in his territory, other than the Karun scheme. 12. The first w as to the effect that, should he at any time obtain from the Persian Government the concession for constructing the Ahwaz dam, he was bound and pledged, if His Majesty’s Government aided him in obtaining the concession, in supplying funds, engineers, &amp;c., for the Ahwaz dam and the irrigation of the land, &amp;c., not to give any share or participation to any subjects of foreign Powders, nor to obtain experts, except British subjects. Eurther, he would allow no one to share or participate in the scheme, provided the concession for constructing the Ahwaz dam should be in his own name and under his own control, and that His Majesty’s Government would not allow any concession for erecting the dam to be given by the Persian Government in the name of syndicates from among British or foreign subjects, or even of Persians (i.e., the concession should be in the name of no Persian, British subject, or foreigner, but in the sheikh’s owm name only). 13. With regard to the second category of possible irrigation schemes, the sheikh pledged and bound himself as regards rivers in his territories such as the Kerkha, Shaur, Jerrahi, and Hindiyan, and also minor works of irrigation on the Karun, other than the Ahwaz dam scheme, not to be obliged to obtain permission from the Persian Government, as such schemes w ould be a measure of tribal and domestic administrative expediency. Moreover, should outside capital and assistance for such projects be necessary, he would give the right of refusal for the execution of such work to such approved British syndicates as His Majesty’s Government might introduce to him ; and he would ask no foreign Government or subjects for money or aid without first giving the opportunity of refusal to the British. This undertaking was given by the sheikh in the confidence that His Majesty’s Government had the intention and desire to see his best interests fully protected. 14 Events at Bushire, owing to the activity of the Nationalists, then necessitated Major Cox’s presence at his post, and the object of his journey to Mohammerah having been attained, there was no reason for his continued absence. He therefore returned to Bushire in the third week in May. Assurances to the Sheikh. 1. The sheikh has several times manifested his anxiety for an extension of the assurances given to him bv Sir A. Hardinge in 1902 and repeated by Major Cox in December 1908. 2. In April he desired to receive assurances from His Majesty’s Government that they would not permit any Persian regime, either absolute or constitutional, to disturb the status quo, that they would not disturb it themselves, and that they would oppose others attempting to do so. 3. Major Cox was instructed to reply, in a letter dated the 16th May, that His Majesty’s Government w'erti prepared to extend the assurances to the sheikh’s successors. He was to state at the same time, as an explanation, that His Majesty’s Government had engaged to respect the integrity and independence of Persia and that this undertaking in itself involved the maintenance of the status quo in Persia, thus they included the continuance of the same autonomy which the sheikh at present enjoyed, and that it w r as evident from the above that any external aggression upon the sheikh would constitute an infringement of that Persian integrity which had been recognised in the Anglo-Russian Convention. 4. In reporting the sheikh’s thanks for these amplified assurances, Major Cox stated that the latter had represented that he regarded them as merely safeguarding him so long as Persia continued to exist as an independent sovereign state and that the sheikh had pressed for a further assurance that would cover the contingency of Persia ceasing to exist as a sovereign state and the intervention or occupation by foreign Powers; and that he had also expressed doubt as to whether the present assurance only provided immunity against the unwarrantable encroachment on hisrights by the absolute Government of the Shah or whether it also covered prevention of similar action on the part of a parliamentary Government. 5. Major Cox was instructed to reply to these representations of the sheikh that. Great Britain and Russia being pledged to respect the integrity of Persia, His Majesty’s Government were unable properly speaking to admit even the possibility of Persia ceasing to be a sovereign state or coming under the occupation of a foreign Power, but that in the unlikely event of such a contingency the assurances would become even more binding than before. He was further permitted to inform the sheikh that whatever change might take place in the form of Government in Persia, His Majesty’s Government were prepared to give him the same support as was promised in 1902 against any encroachment on his rights. In addition Major Cox was authorised to add that His Majesty’s Government were prepared to extend the application of those assurances to his “ heirs and successors.” 6. Major Cox reported that these assurances as now extended and expressed, appeared to satisfy all the sheikh’s requirements, hut that the latter had further requested that for the words “ heirs and successors ” might be substituted the words “ own successive male descendants ” and had expressed the hope that after the words “ male descendants ” might be added the words “ up to a period of 100 years (or, if possible, 150 years.) ’’ His Majesty’s Consul-General had replied that he could give no answer on this point without reference to His Majesty’s Government to whom he was about to communicate these representations. 7. In November Major Cox visited Tehran and the occasion afforded an opportunity for His Majesty’s Minister to confer with him with regard to the sheikh’s wishes. As a result of the discussion which took place, an amended formula of the assurances w T as drawn up and submitted to His Majesty’s Government. By the end of the year no decision, however, had yet been taken. X.— Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The H’Arcy Oil Syndicate appears for the first time in 1909 as a working concern. In May 1908 oil in what was considered to be paying quantity was found at Maidan-i-Minaftun near Shuster, and the following May the enterprise was floated in London, which though actually consisting of two subsidiary companies, will hereafter be generally known in this report as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. In May, too, Messrs. Lloyd, Scott and Co. were appointed managing agents to the company and opened an office at Mohammerah. Some doubts having been expressed as to the rights of the Bakhtiari Khans to shares in the newly formed companies, it was expressly stated that the Khans were entitled to 3 per cent, in: (1) the First Exploitation Company (with an authorised share capital of 600,000 shares of 1/. each, 500,000 of which were issued), and (2) the Bakhtiari Oil Company (with an authorised share capital of 400,000 shares of 1/. each, 300,000 of which were issued). They are therefore entitled to receive “ after the oil is passed through the pipes,” free of cost, 15,000 shares of 1/. each in company (1) and 9,000 shares of 1/. in company (2). Also, when and if further shares are issued and paid up, the chiefs will be entitled to receive 3 per cent, of such further issue “ after the oil is passed through the pipes.” The difficulties respecting the guarding of the company’s working camps appear now to have been overcome. It will be recollected that in 1908 it was found necessary to station near Ahwaz a body of Indian sowars for the protection of the operations of the syndicate in consequence of the attitude of the Khans, who appeared disinclined to carry out the conditions of their agreement with the syndicate by which, in return for an annual subsidy of 2,000/. a year they were bound to furnish the necessary guards. Early in January the Foreign Office informed the vsyndicate that this force could no longer be retained at public expense, since it was not required on public grounds but was solely in the syndicate’s interest, and they were asked if they would be prepared to bear the expense of its continued maintenance. This the syndicate ultimately agreed to do, at a monthly cost of 174/. 8s. However, early in March the Khans, who had begun to adopt a more reasonable attitude towards the syndicate, approached Captain Lorimer with a view to his arranging for the syndicate to take over the management and payment of the guards, a portion (600J. per annum) of the subsidy payable to the Khans being deducted for expenses. An agreement to this effect was signed by two of the Khans claiming to act on behalf of the whole family at the end of the same month. It appears to be working satisfactorily, since no further reports of difficulties have beenreceived, and in June Lieutenant Banking reported that Samsam-es-Sultaneh had expressed himself satisfied with the new guarding arrangements and had made no demur regarding the reduction of the subsidy. The Indian guards having now fulfilled their mission, the occasion seemed favourable for their withdrawal. It was, however, decided to retain them until it could be seen how the new arrangements worked, and it accordingly was not until the end of July that the guards returned to Ahwaz. During the course of the year two questions arose in connection with telegraphic communication with the oilfields. Mr. Reynolds, the local manager of the syndicate, suggested to His Majesty’s consul at Ahwaz that, in view of the existing deficiencies of the telegraph between the oilfields and Mohammerah, an arrangement might be come to with the Indo-European Telegraph Department, who were then engaged in negotiating with the Persian Government for taking over the management of the Arabistan lines (Borasjun-Ahwaz-Mohammerah), for providing adequate means of communication. He proposed that the line between Ahwaz and Mohammerah should run east of the River Karun along the route of the proposed pipe line. One wire, as well as a telephone line should be put up for the exclusive use of the syndicate, who in return would pay a moiety of the cost of the telegraph poles. The question was referred to London, where the department considered it inadvisable that they should be associated with the affairs of the syndicate, while as regards the syndicate’s wish to erect telegraph and telephone wires along the pipe line, they were to be informed that it seemed, at the moment, undesirable to raise the somewhat doubtful point of their rights in this matter, but that in the event of their proceeding with the erection of such lines on their own responsibility, His Majesty’s Government would use their good offices with the Persian Government in support of the syndicate’s contention. A further question arose as to whether the telegraphic facilities granted to the syndicate should be continued. During the past three years telegrams for the syndicate’s manager had been sent, by arrangement with the .Foreign Office, through His Majesty’s consuls at Busra and Mohammerah, and it was pointed out that the syndicate having now become a commercial company, established on business lines, the continuance of the privileges hitherto extended to it might engender a belief among other British firms that the oil company was receiving preferential treatment. It was ultimately decided that the above-mentioned facilities might be allowed to continue until the control of the Arabistan lines was assumed by the Indo-European Telegraph Department. Amongst various minor questions which arose during the year in connection with the company’s concession it may be mentioned that in June the Moin-ut-Tujjar complained that the company were using his land at Shuster as a landing-place without paying him any royalty, adding that he heard they were preparing to build on these lands without asking his permission. In answer to an enquiry, Lieutenant Ranking stated that the land in question was, he believed, that known as Dera Kharzina, and said to be the property of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. The Moin, as usual, professed his inability to produce documentary evidence showing the land was really his, but was ultimately induced to instruct Hadji Rais, the sheikh’s confidential adviser, to treat the matter locally with the company. At the end of December a Mr. Maurice Blake arrived in Tehran in order to endeavour to induce the Persian Government to part with their interests under articles I and 10 of the oil concession. Mr. Blake, who said he was acting for a British financier, whose named he was unauthorised to divulge, stated that he was ready to give 80,000/. down for the rights in question, adding that his principal would give an undertaking that they should remain in British hands. As the Persian Government were at the time in serious financial straits it appeared not improbable that they might succumb to the temptation of so much ready money. The matter was referred to London, where the oil company stated that they strongly deprecated the Persian Government disposing of their interests, adding that if there appeared to be any likelihood of this occurring, they would be prepared to take over half the Persian Government’s interest on condition of receiving an undertaking that the remainder should not. change hands. An intimation to this effect was delivered to the proper quarters, and Mr. Blake left Tehran three weeks later without having achieved the object of his mission. As regards the Sheikh of Mohammerah, the dealings of the company with that chieftain have been during the past year of the highest importance. The question of obtaining a suitable place for their refinery buildings and for other works connected with the storage and export of their produce was one of vital importance for the [339] K34 syndicate, and already in 1908 a site had been selected on Abadan Island, lying to the south of Mohammerah, and having a frontage on the Shat-el-Arab. In order to avoid being called upon to pay an excessive price for the land in question, the syndicate at first contemplated negotiating the purchase through a third party—a course of procedure which would certainly have been found out, and would undoubtedly have caused resentment on the part of the sheikh. It was ultimately decided that the negotiations should be conducted by the resident at Bushire, and an agreement was concluded on the 16th July, of which the following is a brief summary. The sheikh undertakes to hire to the oil company a selected area on Abadan Island having a frontage of about 200 yards on the Shat-el-Arab, together with a strip of land connecting the area aforementioned with the Bahmanshir liiver on the east, and also a strip of land for the pipe line, and its pumping stations, &amp;c., and areas at Aliwaz and Nasiri for the building of storehouses. He also undertakes to appoint watchmen (to he paid by the company) to guard the company’s property and guarantee its safety. The company is to have the right to erect the necessary buildings, structures, and machinery on the lands occupied by them under the agreement. In the event of a renewal of the D’Arcy Concession, an annual sum of 1,500/. shall be paid by the company as rent for the lands aforementioned. Meanwhile, in consideration of the lease of these lands, the company undertakes to pay rent at the rate of 650/. per annum, such rent to he paid in advance every ten years. This agreement having been signed, a sum of 6,500/. was handed over to the sheikh, together with a sum of 10,000/., advanced nominally as a loan by His Majesty’s Government, the actual funds being provided by the company. The sheikh seems to have been sensibly disposed as regards these negotiations, and his terms must he regarded as moderate. A month later the agreement was endorsed by the tribal elders, so that the question of the site for the company’s works now appeared to be satisfactorily settled. As regards the prospects of the company from a business point of view little definite information has been received. The company’s shares are in private hands, and not having come on the London Stock Exchange, their value cannot be quoted. The prospectus issued by the syndicate previous to the enterprise being floated was of the optimistic character usual to such documents, but, in commenting on it in a semi official letter to Major Cox, Lieutenant Wilson, who was formerly in command of the oil guard, and is well acquainted with this part of the country, stated that he considered its tone to be scarcely justified by the results of the past year. The experi mental borings made had not shown oil in productive quantities, except at Maidan-i- Miraftuu, where, he thought, the accounts of the oil discovered were unduly rose- coloured. Failure had been reported from their other reputed oilfields, viz., Kasr-i-Shirir, Daliki, and Mamatain, and Lieutenant Wilson seemed to doubt whether oil would be found at other places where indications of its existence were expected. Moreover, he was of opinion that the cost of the pipe line had been greatly under estimated owing to the difficult nature of the country through which the line must pass. Borings are now said to have been resumed at Mamatain, where previous attempts to find oil had not met with great success, but the principal field of the company’s operations continues to be at Maidan-i-Minaftun. XL— Bakhtiari Affairs. The year 1909 is a memorable one in Bakhtiari history on account of the promi nent part played by that tribe in connection with the constitutional struggle in Persia. Various reasons combined to make Ispahan a suitable field for their exploits. In addition to a certain agitation in favour of the restoration of the constitution among a few enthusiasts, there was general discontent in the town with the despotic regime of Mahommad Ali Shah, and especially with the incompetent administration of the Ikbal-ed-T)owleh, the Governor-General, while the clergy had complaints on account of land taxation, besides the usual stock of grievances of the khans against the Governor-General of Ispahan. A more serious quarrel with the central Govern ment had arisen, owing to the deposition, at the end of 1908, of Samsam-es-Sultaneh from the post of Ilkhani of the tribe. Taking advantage of the serious rioting that broke out on the 1st January between the forces of the Governor-General and the people of Ispahan, two days later Bakhtiari tribesmen began to enter the town. By the 5th January the Government forces had been worsted, 1,000 Bakhtiaris were in possession of Ispahan, and both the British and Russian consular representatives then urged that the only way to restore order lay in the appointment of the Samsam as governor. Under the leadership of their chiefs the behaviour of the wild hillmen'was exemplary, comparative order was quickly restored, and efforts were made to return to its rightful owners the property that had been stolen during the late rioting. But something more was required in order to justify the movement. Accordingly, 'while professing loyalty to the Shah, the Bakhtiari chief proclaimed himself a constitutionalist, and announced that within three days a local constitutional assembly must be elected, otherwise he and his forces would retire and leave the revolting townspeople to the mercy of the Shah. The threat was sufficient and Samsam remained master of the town and during the ensuing months strengthened his position in spite of quarrels with the clergy and dissensions among the khans them selves. At the end of March, Sardar Assad, who was looked up to among the khans as the most enlightened and learned member of the family, arrived from Europe. One of the first results of his return was the agreement come to among the chiefs at Malarnir on the 25th April. By this interesting instrument, the bearing of which has only lately become known, the chiefs agreed to sink their internal differences, to take action to restore the constitutional regime, and also, incidentally, to share anv pecuniary profits which might arise from the undertaking. On the arrival of the Sardar at Ispahan a march on the capital was announced. Matters were, however, not yet ripe; the movement of troops was delayed owing to the want of money, the town of Ispahan not responding satisfactorily to the call on its patriotism. * With the termination of the siege of Tabreez at the end of April the golden opportunity for an attack on Tehran appeared to have passed, and with the subsequent promise of the Shah (under pressure of the two legations) to restore the constitution the avowed objects of the Bakhtiari movement seemed to have been attained. Their subsequent advance on Tehran, and the revolution effected by them in conjunction with the fedai force from Besht under Sipahdar, have been dealt with in the Minister’s narrative of political events of the year. It need only here be mentioned that the khans were more than probably indebted to the Sheikh of Mohammerah for part of the financial assistance which enabled them to undertake' their military operations. According to the latest information the khans aro now on bad terms again with that chieftain, with whom long-standing squabbles are at intervals being patched up. As regards their old rivals, the Kushgai tribe, living to the south of the Bakhtiari hills, it seems more than probable that some arrangement was come to in the spring in order to ensure against an attack being made upon Ispahan from the south in the event of a march against the capital being undertaken. At the present time the khans appear to be comparatively united among themselves. It was to be expected that after the revolution in Tehran, when two of the chiefs fought with their folio Wei's on the side of the Shah, that the old feud between the two rival branches of the family would again break out. This breach of tribal loyalty is, how T ever, said to have been condoned, and one of the dissidents, Nassir Khan, Sardar-i-Jang, a man of consider able force of character, has lately been appointed Governor of Yezd. The relations during the past year of the Bakhtiari khans both with His Majesty’s Legation and with His Majesty’s Consulate at Ahwaz have been more cordial than has been the case during the previous two or three years, and only lately Sardar Muhtashem, one of the most influential members of the lamily, renewed to Lieutenant Banking the oft-made request for British protection. This could not be given, but he and others of the khans have been reminded by the Minister that they enjoy the friendly sympathy of His Majesty’s Government. XII.— Bahrein. Spasmodic efforts on the part of the Persian Government to keep open the question of the status of the Island of Bahrein intermittently continue. Early in 1 ( J08 a case arose regarding the ill-treatment at Lingah of a native of Bahrein. The matter was brought to the notice of the Persian Government by Mr. Marling in a note dated the 30th March, in which he reminded them that in 1906 they had been informed that His Majesty’s Government considered the Island of Bahrein and its inhabitants to be under British protection, and protested against the arbitrary action of the Governor of Lingah in punishing a British-protected subject and refusing to admit the good offices of the British resident. The Persian Government replied on the 9th April that the proper authorities had been instructed to make due reparation to the man in question ; but with regard to the Island of Bahrein, they referred to previous correspondence on the subject, and declared that it “ w r ould be admitted that the proprietary rights of the Persian Government over the island are not a matter to be disputed.” Various fruitless attempts were made to persuade the Persian Govern-ment to substitute a reply the wording of which would he less objectionable than that of the note above mentioned, and finally, on the 19th December, Sir G. .Barclay returned this communication as inadmissible. Early in January 1909 Sir G. Barclay was approached on behalf of the Persian Government, and it was arranged that the British note returning the Mushir-ed- Dowleh’s reply of the 9th April should be withdrawn, on condition that an amended reply on the part of the Persian Government should be sent in place of the note to which exception had been taken. Accordingly a communication was received, dated the 12th January, 1909, in which it was stated that, as regards the Island of Bahrein, Bis Majesty’s Minister “'will be quite enlightened as to the arguments of the Persian Government; but that as every effort has always been made lor the administration of justice and the enquiry into the claims of persons who are wronged .... it is evident that the Persian Government officials will not fail in the necessary endeavours for the administration of justice.” This note was accepted and the arrangement was approved by Sir E. Grey, but Sir G. Barclay was instructed to impress upon the Persian Government that His Majesty’s Government could not consider it as final. A further note was addressed on the 13th May, in which the Persian Government were informed that Sir E. Grey had approved Sir G. Barclay’s action in connection with the substitution of the note of the 12th January, 1909, for that of the 12th April, 1908. This communication added that His Majesty’s Government maintain, as regards “ the status of Bahreinis in Persia, the attitude explained in Mr. Marling’s note of the 30th March, and they will be guided entirely by their own view's of the position should any action of the Persian authorities make representations necessary.” No reply to this note has been received from the Persian Government. XIII.— Tubco-Persian Frontier, 1908. The close of 1907 found the Persian commissioner at Urumia aw'aiting the arrival of the Turkish commission. On the 2nd January, 1908, Tahir Pasha, the Turkish commissioner, w T ent uninvited to the village of Yalsik, 6 miles north-west of Urumia, accompanied by fifty Turkish soldiers. He was visited there on the 4th January by the Persian commissioner, and a discussion ensued as to the place of meeting of the commission, the Persian suggesting Urumia and the Turk Van or some village in Salmas. The Turkish commissioner referred the question to Constantinople. Urumia w'as eventually decided upon, and on the 26th January the Turkish commission arrived at that town. Meanwhile collisions had occurred between Turkish and Persian troops. The first took place towards the end of December near Merivan between the governor of Persian Kurdistan and a Turkish force, the latter being repulsed. The Turks were at the same time said to be inciting Turkish tribes and trying to bribe Persian tribes. The second collision took place near Soujboulak between the Governor-General of Azerbaijan and Turkish troops under Mohammad Fazl Pasha. The former reached Soujboulak with a force of some 3,000 men about the 8th January for the purpose of suppressing disorders among the Persian Kurdish tribes. As other movements of Turkish troops were reported, His Majesty’s consul at Kermanshah was ordered to Kasr-i-Shirin, so as to be in a position to send early information of any movements on the frontier. On the 11th January Mr. Wratislaw reported from Urumia that a telegram from the Governor-General of Azerbaijan stated that the Kurds, instigated by the Turkish general at Pasvah, had moved against him, and 1,000 of them were between him and Tabreez. On the 16th January the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs informed Mr. Marling that the Kurds had practically surrounded the Governor-General at Soujboulak, and that the Turkish commander had sent him menacing letters warning him against taking military action against the Kurds. The Persian commissioner at Urumia made representations regarding these proceedings of the Turkish commander at Pasvah to his Turkish colleague, who disavowed them. On the 21st January Mr. Marling reported that the Turkish commander had summoned the Govern or-General to evacuate Soujboulak. The Persian Government appealed to His Majesty’s Government to assist the Persian Ambassador at the Porte in obtaining a cessation of the activity of the Turkish troops on the frontier. Kepresentations were made by the British and Russian Ambassadors at Constantinople, in reply to which the Porte disclaimed ail knowledge of the alleged forward movement or of the ultimatum, but after enquiry admitted the despatch of a letter by the Turkish general and severely reprimanded him for sending it. On the 25th January the Turkish general with 1,500 Turkish troops, six guns*and a large force of Kurds advanced to within 11 miles of Soujboulak, the inhabitants of which place were threatened with bombardment unless they joined the Turks. On the same day the Governor-General evacuated Soujboulak and retired to Miandoab. In answer to representations by the British and Russian Ambassadors, the Porte denied that Soujboulak had been occupied by Turkish troops. The Porte also repre sented to the Persian Government the inadvisability of any punitive expedition as likely to endanger the success of the frontier negotiations. At the same time fresh instructions were sent by the Porte to its frontier commanders to refrain from all forward movements, and to prevent the frontier tribes passing from one side to the other. On the 3rd February Captain Haworth reported from Kasr-i-Shirin that 100 Turkish cavalry and three guns had arrived at Khanikin; these were followed next day by 200 boxes of ammunition and 150 cavalry mounted on mules. In all there were on the 5th February 700 to 800 troops and 3 guns at Khanikin, 400 at Bedrai, and 400 at Mandaliz : On the 13th February another 400 infantry arrived at Khanikin. These movements were said to be directed against the vali of Pusht-i-Kuh, who was at Bedrai with his troops. In spite of the Porte’s denial it turned out that the Turkish troops entered Soujboulak the day after it was evacuated by the Persian force. The Turkish commander also brought all the Kurdish chiefs into the town by force, and pressed them to attack the Persians. A suggestion was made by the Russian Government that the two consuls at Urumia should visit Soujboulak to report on the situation there, but it was decided that it was inadvisable that they should leave Urumia. Meanwhile on the 3rd February the frontier com mission met at Urumia and the Turkish commissioner submitted a memorandum in which he mentioned the treaties on which he relied, especially that of 1639 The memorandum went on to state that the interference of Persian officials in Kurdistan from the frontier district of Suleimanieh to Bayazid was based on no right, and that the Kurds had now returned to their allegiance to the Sultan. In reply the Persian commissioner took his stand on the treaty of Erzeroum, the 3rd article of which bars any demand for the cession of territory with the exceptions mentioned in article 2, Ihe Turkish commissioner disagreed as to the interpretation to be placed on article 3. and said he must refer the matter to Constantinople. Further memoranda were exchanged, but they contained little new matter, except a demand by the Turks that “ an end should be put to your interference with our tribes and territory in the districts of Kurdistan from Bayazid to Suleimanieh with the exception of Kotur. ,, On the 21st February Tahir Pasha informed Mr. Wratislaw that he considered his mission was accomplished, jxs he had reduced the frontier question to the interpreta tion of article 3, and that he proposed to move to Van to await further orders. On the 22nd February the Turkish commander and some of the troops left Soujboulak, but a force under Izzet Pasha remained in the town. Izzet Pasha aud the majority oi his troops had evacuated the town by the 28th February. On the 29th February the Turkish commission left Urumia for Serai, in Turkey. A member of the com mission informed Mr. Wratislaw confidentially that the Turkish commissioner had, apart from his ostensible instructions, which were conciliatory, secret instructions. These he refused to show to his colleagues, and they were evidently of a different tenour. On the 20th February the Turkish Ambassador at St. Petersburgh spon taneously assured the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs that the alleged military preparations on the Turco-Persian frontier were not in any way undertaken against Russia or in an unfriendly spirit. They were merely a precaution against possible trouble at the hands of Persian brigands. The Turkish Government wished to assure Russia of their friendship and pacific disposition. The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, in reply, said that he took act of these assurances. He added that the preparations had attracted the attention of both the Russian and the British Govern ments, and had caused him some uneasiness. His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople was instructed to inform the Porte that His Majesty’s Government had learnt with satisfaction of the assurances given at St. Petersburgh by the Turkish Ambassador, but that grave anxiety as to the f uture had been caused to His Majesty’s Government by the Turkish invasion aud occupation of Persian territory and the reports of Turkish preparations. The Sheikh of Mohammerah having expressed anxiety on account of Turkish military preparations, he was informed that His Majesty’s Government were fully alive to the situation, but did not anticipate Turkish aggression near Mohammerah. At the same time His Majesty’s Ambassador at the Porte was instructed that while His Majesty’s Government were content to let Russia take the lead in proposing steps to stop Turkish aggression in the north, the position would be [339] ~ Lmaterially altered if there were an Ottoman advance on the south, especially near Mohammerah. His Majesty’s Government were not prepared to recognise any frontier except that laid down by the Mediation Commissioners in 1850. By the 2nd March the Turkish force at Khanikin had risen to 1,000 infantry, 500 caValrv, and 3 guns. More infantry were being collected. On the 3rd March there Tvas still 300 Turkish troops in Soujboulak. On this date the Turkish com mission was ordered by the Sultan to return to Urumia and resume negotiations. The Persian Government having proposed that the negotiations should be based on a frontier line being traced in the neutral zone, the British and Russian consuls at Urumia w'ere instructed to assist as far as possible in discussions being conducted on this basis, but, after an exchange of memoranda between the Turkish and Persian commissions, a deadlock ensued. The Persian Go'vernment having addressed a circular note to the Powers on the subject of Turkish aggression, advantage W'as taken of the evacuation of Soujboulak by Turkish troops in March, as a result of British and Russian representations at Constantinople, by the two representatives at Tehran to submit identic notes impressing on the Persian Government their indebtedness to England and Russia. The Persian Government, in replv, expressed themselves very grateful for what had been done and hopeful of further aid in the future. On the 20th April Mr. Marling reported that the Persian Government w T ere discussing the advisability of dispatching a special mission to Constantinople to negotiate direct with the Porte. The British and Russian Governments w ere prepared to support such a mission, but the Persian Government eventually decided not to send one. . . , On the 22nd April the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke to His Majesty’s Ambassador about the mobilisation of the Turkish IVth Army Corps at Erzeroum. He and the Russian General Staff were disquieted by these preparations which, if continued, would compel Russia to take precautionary measures in self-defence. On the 27th April His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople reported that the Persian Ambassador had received from the Porte a memorandum in which they upheld the contention of the Turkish commissioner that only parts of the frontier w ere dealt with in the treaty of 1847, and that earlier treaties must serve as the basis of negotiations on points on which the treaty of 1847 w r as silent. The memorandum laid stress on the provisional character of the status quo agreement of 1869, and made no mention of the neutral zone. The Porte suggested that the Persian commissioner should be instructed on these lines. The memorandum, according to the Grand Vizier, formed the basis of instructions sent to the Turkish commissioner. Towards the end of April there w r as a large incursion of Kurds, who ravaged the country to within a few miles of ITrumia and cut the telegraph wires. The Grand Vizier, in reply to strong representations by the Persian Ambassador, promised to instruct the authorities at Van and Mosul to prevent Kurds invading Persia. On the 2nd May, telegraphic communication being restored, Mr. TV rati si aw reported that several Persian villages south of Urumia had submitted to the Turks, and many inhabitants of other villages were migrating to Prumia. He added that Kurds from Mergavar and Ushnu, for w r hom the Turks were directly responsible, had committed the outrages to the south. On the 3rd May the Porte declared to Mr. Barclay that the most stringent orders had been sent to their frontier officials to restrain the Kurds under their authority. On the 6th May Mr. Wratislaw reported that the Persian commissioner had received instructions to commence negotiations on the basis of the treaty of Erzeroum and the neutral zone, and to report the result. On the 22nd May Mr.’Wratislaw reported that the number of Turkish troops in Tergavar bad been greatly increased. On the 24th May the village of Shaitanahad, 20 miles south oi Urumia, was surrounded by 4,000 Kurds, mostly from Ushnu, but partly from Mergavar. He feared a general forward movement of Turkish troops or Kurds acting for them. There w r as still no new's of the Turkish commission. On the 27th May Mr. Wratislaw reported that the whole district south of the Baranduz River had offered to submit to the Turks, and that the Baranduz district was likely to do the same. The Russian vice-consul and Colonel Tumansky had, under instructions from the Russian Government, started on a journey along the frontier. On the 9th June the Turkish commissioner arrived at Urumia. On the 11th June the Kurds again cut the telegraph wdres near Urumia and ravaged the country side, committing many atrocities. The village of Ardeshai, the port of Lake U rumia, w r as attacked. Other Kurds, from Tergavar, attacked Anhar, 4 miles west of Urumia, which latter place was full of refugees. The bazaar w r as closed and a riot was probable. Mr. W ratislaw and the acting Russian consul called on the Turkish commissioner to point out toliim the responsibility of the Turkish Government for the depredations of the Kurds. In reply they received only vague assurances. Mr. Wratislaw expressed the opinion that it seemed futile, whilst the country was being ravaged through the negligence or connivance of the Turks, to talk of renewing negotiations. On the 15th June the Turkish commissioner called on Mr. Wratislaw and made proposals for restoring order. Mr. Wratislaw and the Russian consul concurred in the proposals, and advised the Persian commissioner to accept them. The situation, however, continued bad, and the attitude of the Turkish commissioner, though he promised intervention, was very unsatisfactory. Mr. Wratislaw, on the 18th June, said it was difficult to resist the conclusion that the Turks were conniving at the disorders, if they had not instigated them, with a view to rendering the situation intolerable. On the 17th June the Persian commissioner invited the Turkish commissioner to formulate his claims and furnish proofs, but only received an evasive reply. On the 22nd June Mr. Barclay was instructed to join with his Russian colleague in strong representations against the action of 1 urkish troops in advancing into Persian territory and in allowing the Kurds to commit depredations. In. reply to these representations the Grand Vizier promised that every elfort would be made to restrain the Kurds, and any troops who might have advanced beyond the neutral zone would be recalled. On the 26th June the Persian Ambassador at Constantinople made very energetic representations to the Sultan, to wbom he pointed out that his constant representations at the Porte had produced no effect. At a conference with the Sultan’s secretaries, he threatened to leave Constantinople unless the present state of things on the frontier was improved. On the 1st July the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs learnt that the German Government had been asked by the Persian Government to intervene at Constanti nople, and were disposed to do so. He therefore considered it important to make known in Tehran the results of British and Russian joint representations. On this date reports from Urumia stated that the country was quite quiet and the telegraph line restored. The Persian commissioner had verbally informed the Turkish commissioner that, relying principally on long possession and article 3 of the Erzeroum Treaty, Persia claimed all districts east of the status qno frontier, and demanded the withdrawal of the troops and damages for their aggression. On the 3rd J uly Mr. Barclay was authorised to support his Russian colleague m making a representation to the Porte to the effect that it had been established, by an enquiry held by the British and Russian Consuls at Urumia, that the Kurus, for whose conduct the Turks were exclusively responsible, were the authors of the outrages at the end of May, and that effective measures were strongly needed to put an end to an intolerable state of things. , On the 6th July Mr. Wratislaw reported that a company of Turkish infantry and fifty cavalry had gone from Tergavar to Charik. On the 12th July the Turkish commissioner returned an entirely uncon- ciliatorv reply to the Persian commissioner’s proposition of a basis for negotiations. Mr Wratislaw expressed the opinion that no solution was possible unless third parties intervened. On the same day Mr. Wratislaw reported that Izzet Pasha had arrived at Urumia on the 9th from Pasvah with twenty Turkish cavalry and sixtv Kurds. The Persian commissioner insisted on the Kurds being sent hack, which was'done after some demur. The Turks were reported to be building permanent barracks at Mawana and making a telegraph line to that place. On the 13th July the British and Russian representatives at Constantinople again made representations. The Grand Vizier replied that he knew nothing of the dispatch of troops to Charik or of barracks being constructed at Mawana. He said that Turkish frontier officials had obtained formal engagements from the chiefs of the frontier Kurds not to advance into Persian territory and not to stir up trouble among Sunni Kurds over the border. On the 18th July 120 Turkish troops occupied Kulunji, 20 miles north of Lrumia, in the Anzel district. With them were fifty Kurds with Ismail Agha, who addressed letters to various villages informing them that they had been annexed by Turkey. In consequence of the Persian commissioner’s remonstrances, Turkish ana J ersian delegates were sent to Anzel and reported the above facts, and that the officer commanding said he had come by order of Yaver Pasha. Urumia was now cut off on every side except the lake from the rest of Azerbaijan. On the 27th July the Persian commissioner proposed to his Turkish colleague that reference should be made to Constantinople and Tehran requesting instructions regarding the interpretation of article 3 of the Treaty of Erzerouim The Turk refused to refer the question.On the 22nd July the Turkish commissioner stated that the Turkish troops had been sent to Kulunji by mistake, and would withdraw, i hey withdrew, but only to Behleh, 6 miles distant, in the Somai district. ^ On the 11th August two companies of Turkish infantry with seme Kurds, under Yaver Pasha, entered Baranduz district, and the population was ordered to pay no more taxes to the Persian Government, lahir Pasha, in reply to the 1 ersian commis sioner’s remonstrances, stated that the troops had come to keep order, that all Anzel and the western portion of Baranduz were Turkish, and he was entitled to send troops to anv disputed district. At the same time a Turkish official arrived at TJrumia m order to establish a salt administration in Anzel as soon as the district was definitively occupied, but he returned to Turkey a week later. The Russian Government now desired to make formal representations at the Porte regarding the Turkish advance, hut as the new Turkish Government seemed inclined to try to settle the frontier question amicably, His Alajesty s Government decided that the moment was inopportune for representations. On the 18th August Tahir informed Mr. TYratislaw confidential!} that Ya\er Pasha had been ordered by the Minister of TYar on the 12th August not to advance beyond the positions held on that date. In reply to a question oi the Persian commis sioner, Tahir put in a written statement claiming all the territory claimed in Dervish Pasha’s map and Sakiz, Ranch, Solduz, and Soujboulak in addition. Izzei Pasha replaced Fazl Pasha in command of the troops at Pasvah, the latter going to Bagdad. On the 24th August the Russian Government, while agreeing that the moment was inopportune for representations at Constantinople, suggested that an identic communication should be made to the Persian Government indicating that the new and satisfactory departure on the part of the Porte was due to the constant efforts of the two Governments. Tahir now’ claimed a much advanced irontier for the Bagdad vilayet, and declared that he recognised neither neutral zone nor status quo. Turkish officials were reported to be collecting taxes in Anzel. On the 26th August Tahir was ordered to ifitiis, hia place as president of the Turkish Commission being taken by Daniel Pasha, who lelt w ith the commission for Turkev, in order to be in telegraphic communication with the Porte. On the 30th August the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs informed Sir G. Lowther that most of the troops in the frontier districts would be withdrawn, Pasvah and other places east of the zone, as w r ell as places in the zone which w ere incon testably Persian, would be evacuated, the idea being to restore the status quo violated in recent vears. During September the number of Turkish troops on the^ fiontier was much reduced, and Paver Pasha left for Van, but the occupied districts were still held by troops, who advanced somewhat in Baranduz. T he Somai Kurds also displayed considerable activity in Salmas, robbing caravans and posts ; the telegraph line was cut, and letters only got through wfith difficulty. Pending the withdrawal of Turkish troops, the identic communication to the Persian Government was held back. The withdrawal of the British and Russian consuls from TJrumia was deferred for the same reason. On the 24th September the Shah personally expressed to Mr. Marling his gratitude for the intervention of Great Britain and Russia in the frontier question. On the 2nd October Sir G. Barclay, now Minister at Tehran, was instructed to make the identic communication to the Persian Government, and on the 9th October Mr. Wratislaw’ was recalled to Tabreez, at which place the situation had become serious. On the 14th November the reply of the Persian Government to tne identic communication w’as received. It was to the ellect that, although at certain points the Turkish troops had been reduced, no place had been evacuated, and in some places outside the zone, notably in Baranduz, further encroachments had been made. XIII a.—Ttjrco-Persian Frontier, 1909. The vear opened with the Turks still in occupation of Persian territory, and the Persian commissioner still awaiting at Urumia the return of Daniel Pasha from Turkey. On the 4th February Sir G. Barclay learnt from the Turkish cLargd d’affaires at Tehran that the Turkish Government had proposed to the Porte the dissolution of the frontier commission, and that negotiations should be resumed at Tehran or Constantinople. At the same time the Persian Minister foi 1 oieign Affairs complained to Sir G. Barclay’ of the encroachments of the lurks. 1 hose, according to the Turkish chargd d’affaires, consisted only of the dispatch of small detacbmouts to Urumia and Khoi to protect Turkish consulates and subjects. The Persian Government complained that customs-houses had been established in the-Soujboulak district. On the 5th March they complained that Turkish gendarmes had been sent to Miadek, near Urumia, to distribute passports to the inhabitants. On the 8th March Mr. Wratislaw reported from Tabreez that Turkish aggressions had recommenced, and that a body of Young Turks, with arms and ammunition for the v ersian nationalists, had entered Salmas, while others were helping the nationalists of ^hoi against the Makulis. On the 1st April the Turkish charge d’affaires in London informed His Majesty’s GoYemment that, as soon as order had been restored in Persia, his Government would be ready to continue the discussion of the Turco-Persian frontier question, and that, in the event of their failure to come to an agreement, they proposed to have recourse to the mediation of His Majesty’s Government. On the 15th April the Persian Government once more complained of the Turkish encroachments, stating that there were now sixty Turkish soldiers in or near Khoi, and another 200 in disguise helping the nationalists. On the 5th May, according to confidential information which reached the Russian Government from Erzeroum, 360 Turkish troops w T ere ordered to proceed to protect a consulate, presumably at Urumia. At the end of May forty Russian soldiers were sent from Tabreez to Urumia, as a state of anarchy was said to prevail there, the governor having been expelled. On the 1st June the British and Russian Legations at Tehran received a note from the Persian Government, complaining that Turkish troops had been sent to Chehrik, Yezdikan, Sheikh Razi and Hijek, in Persian territory; that the inhabi tants were being encouraged to become Turkish subjects under threat of being plundered; that military measures had been taken and customs-houses established near Soujboulak; that the tribes were being urged to attack Soujboulak the Turkish consular agent at which place was inviting the Kurds to become Turkish subjects; and that near (Jrumia Turkish passports were being distributed. The Persian Government invoked the good offices of the two Powers. On the 10th June Sir G. Barclay reported that there was little doubt that the Turks had been more active recently, and the advantageous position gained by the Turkish consul-general at Tabreez, owing to the ill-advised conduct of the Russian military authorities there, made this activity very undesirable. At this time an affray between Persian nationalists and Turkish troops occurred at Hilman, in Salinas, due to the Turkish consul for Khoi attempting to protect a Persian Kurd from the local authorities. There were casualties on both sides, but on hearing a report that Kurds were coming, the people offered to submit to the Turkish consul, and the nationalist governor fled. On the 26th June the Turkish representative at Urumia brought into that town all the Turkish soldiers in the neighbourhood, 400 Kurds, some of them in Turkish uniforms, and a number of Sunni villagers. Some fighting took place in the town, which was plundered by the Kurds. There were ten casualties, including one Turkish soldier wounded. The intervention of the Russian vice-consul led to peace being restored the next day, and the Kurds left the town, but pillaged the environs. Some 150 Turkish troops’remained in Urumia, and a few small detachments in the surrounding villages. On the 8th July the Russian Government asked for the support of His Majesty’s Government in demanding the withdrawal of Turkish troops from Persian territory and the issue of formal instructions to Turkish consuls, in the Urumia district to refrain from interference in Persian affairs and from granting Turkish nationality to the local population. The Russian Government considered that the Anglo- Russian convention and previous conventions demanded that such action should be taken for the maintenance of the integrity of Persia. An identic communication was accordingly made to the Porte on the 13th July. The Porte, in reply, declared that it had no territorial designs on Persian territory, and merely wished to protect its subjects. A new consul had been appointed to Urumia, and a commission would be sent to enquire into the alleged irregularities and to withdraw protection which had been improperly granted. The British acting consul at Mohammerah having drawn attention to the fact that the frontier laid down by the mediating commissioners in 1850 differs considerably, to the disadvantage of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, from the frontier locally recognised by the Busra and Mohammerah authorities, His Majesty’s Government decided that, while they had no desire to disturb the frontier status quo as locally observed, and which, they were well aware, never precisely coincided with the line as drawn in 1^50 bv the mediating commissioners and subsequently accepted by the Persian Govern ment, they would hesitate to contend that the line as drawn in 1850 was cancelled by any subsequent declaration of the two mediating Powers. The line was defined by [339] Mthe mediating commissioners as an equitable compromise, and was apparently upheld by the later commission which met in 1876. His Majesty’s Government could not therefore formally support the sheikh in claiming that his frontier extends beyond that line except after consultation with the Hussian Government and as a result of an agreement with the Turkish Government, who possess a copy of the man of 1850. From a report from His Majesty’s vice-consul at Van it appears that between the 14th August and 11th September the Vali of Van visited the frontier zone, passing through Bashkaleh, Gavvar, Tergavar, Mergavar, and within a short distance of Soujboulak. The journey was undertaken under orders from Constantinople and proposals for the organisation of Turkish civil posts in the zone were asked for. The vali proposed that the district should be formed into a mutessariflik with head-quarters at Ushnu and subordinate kaimakamates at Mawana, Chari, and Singan, and that gendarmerie and police should be organised. In conversation with His Majesty’s vice-consul the vali explained that Turkey has equal rights with Persia in the zone, and that the miserable condition of the natives of the zone, due to the distracted state of Persia, made it necessary that Turkey should assert her rights. In any case the presence of Russian troops in Azerbaijan for the protection of Russian interests w r as a good precedent for Turkey to follow with regard to Turkish interests in the zone. Early in December the Russian consul at Urumia reported that two regiments with four guns and six machine-guns had entered the Somai, Baradost, Tergavar, Mergavar, and Dasht districts. At the same time a Ptussian report from Soujboulak stated that 300 Turkish cavalry, 200 infantry, and 2 guns had gone to Mamaehe and Inagade. This move was said to be due to the dispatch to Mamediar, in Solduz, of 100 Persian soldiers. The Governor-General of Azerbaijan reported that the Kaimakam of Pasvah had demanded the recall of these Persian troops and had sent 200 men and two guns to Mamediar. On the 6th December the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs said that the Turks had sent forty more men to Urumia, and were increasing their forces on the frontier. An afiVay had occurred at Anhar, near Urumia, between Persian villagers and Turkish troops, several of the former being killed. The Russian Government wished to make representations to the Porte and to demand the withdrawal of Turkish troops from Soiduz, but as the Persian Government did not for the moment desire the assistance of the two Powers no representations were made. The Turkish Ambassador in London on the 10th December informed His Majesty’s Government that the force at Solduz would act strictly on the defensive, and that the Persian Government had been asked to order their troops to avoid a collision. The Grand Vizier, in answer to enquiries by the two Ambassadors, confirmed this, and denied that there had been any movement of troops in the Urumia district. On the 23rd December the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs had a conversa tion with the Turkish Ambassador, from which he inferred that the Porte might be willing to have the frontier question settled by mediation if Persia were first advised to remain quiet and avoid hostilities. He said he was disposed to mediate if the Porte withdrew at once from Persian territory and undertook to withdraw from the disputed zone w T hen normal relations were established. His Majesty’s Government expressed their willingness to communicate with the Persian Government in this sense if approached by the Porte. On December the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, having received a communication from the Turkish Ambassador, decided that it would he better to drop the question of mediation and simply to make representations to the Porte suggesting the withdrawal of Turkish troops from Solduz, which was undoubtedly Persian territory. A communication to this effect w r as made to the Porte by the Russian Ambassador. The end of 1909 found the Turco-Persian question no nearer settlement, and it. seems clear that so long as Russian troops remain in occupation of Persian territory in Azerbaijan the Turks will remain active on the western frontier. Should the Russian occupation of Azerbaijan be prolonged indefinitely, the Ottoman Government may not improbably advance their troops even further on Persian territory, partly because they are unwilling to allow Russia to absorb Azerbaijan, and partly because they are in sympathy with the new 7 constitutional rdgime in Persia. XIV.—The Press. The press, which was entirely suppressed by the coup d'Etat of June 1908, was revived after the fall of Mohammad All Shah in July 1909. It is impossible to speakof it after its revival in the same eulogistic terms as were employed in referring to it in the previous yearly report. Iwo new daily papers appeared, called respectively the “ Iran-i-Nau ” (New Persia) and the “Sharq” (Each). The former, after a somewhat stormy existence of *bout six months, ceased to be published, owing to bankruptcy. The latter is -.ndoubtedly a reactionary organ in the garb of nationalism. It is run by an Armenian, who has stated to the Russian Minister that, in his view, there is no hope whatever of Persia saving herself, and has urged that the Russian troops at Kazvin should be brought on to Tehran. He appears to be working for the latter end by endeavouring to inflame public opinion against Russia. The daily attacks upon Russia which appear in this paper must therefore be considered in this light. As to the other newspapers which appear, there is nothing in them of any value either from a political or literary point of view. XV. —Chronological Account of Principal Events in Persia during 1909.

Azerbaijan ,—The early days of 1913 found Persia confronted with a Cabinet crisis which had been latent ever since the return of Saad-ed-Dowleh in November. The vicissitudes which preceded the fall of Samsam-es-Sultaueh s Cabinet were fully described in last year’s annual report, when it was shown that its end was iiastened by a serious subversive movement in the province of Azerbaijan which, at the apparent instigation of agents of Saad-ed-Dowleh, declared itself irreconcilably hostile to the continuance of the Bakhtiaris in office. This important province in the north-western corner of Persia plays, at the present moment, a special part in the Persian question. The fact that the province has for many years past been ruled by successive heirs- apparent has given it a sort of semi-independent position towards the rest of Persia • its population is somewhat distinctive in race from the ordinary Persians, whilst the common language is Turki, a corrupt form of Turkish that is not understood bv the generality of Persians. At the outset of the revolutionary constitutional movement the people of Tabriz distinguished themselves by their so-called “ nationalism.^ Russian influence, or the repressive measures taken to restrain the new political creed within suitable bounds, have succeeded in entirely stamping out the progressive spirit.

[361] Band it is said that it is to-day as much as a man’s life is worth to pronounce the hated word “ mashruteh ” (constitution) in public. From being Liberals at the commence ment of the constitutional movement the people of Azerbaijan have become outwardly pronounced lieactionaries, and that province probably now contains nearly all that remains of those who still hope to see a restoration of Mohammed Ali Mirza. 2. It is realised at Tehran that the geographical position of Azerbaijan brings that province especially under the Russian influence that emanates from the Caucasus, whilst the continued presence of Russian troops in the various districts is calculated, it is thought, to encourage the Russification of the people, and cause them to gradually forget that they form part of the Persian nation. It is but natural that Russia should take a special interest in the administration of a province that is contiguous to the Russian frontier throughout its entire northern length, but the anxiety shown by the Cabinet of St. Petersburg!! to secure a Russian tool as Governor- General creates distrust of Russian intentions, and it is always feared that the day will come when some difference of opinion between the provincial and central authorities will result in this large province separating itself from the mother-country, declaring itself independent under Russian protection, or frankly seeking to be incorporated in the Russian Empire. For this reason any popular movement in Azerbaijan has an immediate effect upon public opinion at Tehran, provided that there is good ground for supposing that such movement is not merely the result of the machinations of some interested wirepuller, as would appear to have been the case in the agitation engineered at the end of last year, which, if it hastened the fall of the Bakhtiari Cabinet, did not in any way improve the political prospects of Saad-ed- Dowleh, in whose favour it was apparently organised. 3. No review of current events in Persia in 191.3 would be complete that did not examine the Azerbaijan question exhaustively. It can be urged, and easily, that the present day situation is none of Russia’s seeking, that it is due to natural influence outside her control, and that she would gladly be t'elieved of a burden that weighs very heavily upon the national exchequer, with no apparent return; but the tact, nevertheless, must remain that she is in virtual occupation of the province in a manner that is at variance with the spirit of the Anglo-Russian understanding, and that her officials on the spot are making no visible effort either to relinquish their hold on the country or to assist the nominal Persian authorities in such a manner as would help them to resume its administration should the Russian troops be at any time withdrawn. Shuja-ed-Dowleh, the Russian puppet who figures as the official representative of Persian sovereignty, is not only a tool in Russian hands, but has actually to submit all his daily correspondence to a functionary of the Russian consulate, who tells him how to frame his answers to the various communications that he may receive, either from the Government at Tehran or from persons in the province. The personality and ability of the acting Russian consul-general is clearly not such as to encourage a belief that he is personally responsible for the situation that has been created. He must therefore get his instructions from some higher authority. It would be interesting to know from whom, since I have been informed on most excellent authority that he himself boasts that his orders come direct from St. Petersburgh, and that he is virtually independent of the legation. 4. The position in Azerbaijan is the subject of daily anxiety for the Persian Government, which feels that it is entirely dependent upon Russian goodwill for what may occur. Much of the hesitation about the elections for a new Medjliss, w'hich has brought no small amount of discredit upon the present Cabinet in the eyes of the people, was due to grave uncertainty as to what may happen in Azerbaijan, since it is readily recognised that a refusal on the part of the largest province to send deputies to Tehran would be almost equivalent to a declaration of secession. No concealment of the fact is made that it all depends upon the Russian consulate-general whether delegates are sent or not. It would not be sufficient for M. Preobrajensky or his successor merely to state that they are neutral and take no interest in the matter. Such a declaration would be taken to mean that Russia does not wish deputies to be sent, and none w r ould be sent. It is significant of the acceptance of the fact that the entire provincial mechanism is in the hands of the Russians that it is felt that no elections will be possible, unless the Russian consul-general states categorically to Shuja-ed-DowTeh that it is the wish of Russia that elections should be held. 5. A clear indication of the position claimed and maintained by Russia in Azerbaijan w r as shown when Sipahdar went to Tabriz. Although a reputed Russophil, and believed to be a nominee of the Russian Government, he was opposed by theconsulate-general from the day he set his foot in Tabriz, presumably because it was felt that he could not be so thoroughly relied upon as Shuja. Finally, after his position had been made an impossible one for some months, he was obliged to give up the appointment and leave the country on the charge of having been the prime mover i^ the agitation which resulted in the downfall of the Bakhtiari Cabinet. After his discomfiture, the Persian Government has felt that no good would come of endeavouring to put anyone else in Shuja’s place. In order to reassert Persian sovereignty over the province, the idea has been mooted of naming the heir-apparent, the Shah’s younger brother, Governor-General, but, though the prince, who is only a boy, has been nominally appointed, it has not been judged advisable to take any steps, either to confirm his appointment or to get rid of Shuja, clearly though the Govern ment would love to do so. 6. The attitude of Shuja-ed-Dowleh towards the Belgian financial administration has been the cause of constant and bitter complaints during the past year. There can be but small doubt that the systematic opposition to the Belgians which has characterised the actions of the provincial officials during the past year was largely due to the fact that they realised that the former did not enjoy the support of the Kussian consulate-general. It appeared at one time as if the Russian hostility was directed against the personality of M. Bans quin, the provincial director of customs and finance agent, of whom M. Poklewsky often complained when he was Minister here. When, however, his withdrawal produced no change in the situation, it became evident that it was the institution, and not individuals, that failed to find favour in Russian eyes. If any proof that such was the case was needed, it was given when the entire attitude of the consulate-general and the provincial authorities was changed, in consequence of friendly representations made by His Majesty’s Government at St. Peters burgh. Since the representations were made the situation has much improved, but just towards the end of the year murmurs again began to make themselves heird, to the effect that the opposition to the financial administration was being renewed, more especially in the matter of the alienation of Crown lands to Russian protected persons. 7 The Belgian Administration is alone in Azerbaijan in a position to carry on, in the interests of the Central Government, a struggle against Russian encroach ments, which no other Persian department could maintain. The Belgians are not in the precarious position which Persian officials occupy. If they are ejected through Russian influence, they are merely transferred to another part of the country, or, at the most, are sent back to their official employment in Belgium, 'this security gives them a courage and assurance which cannot be possessed by Persian officials, who are rendered timorous by the serious dangers which their material interests incur from Russian hostility. In addition to this, Russian agents cannot treat Europeans in the same way as they do Persians. The Belgian official discusses affairs as an tiqual with Russian consuls, who cannot treat his representations with the disregard which native expostulations would encounter. Moreover, the Belgians appear to have considerable professional pride, which leads them to work for the success ot their Administration with a devotion that may possibly attain its object. They have learned much irom past experience, and it has been shown that in Azerbaijan, as in other parts of Persia, they are fighting, under dispiriting conditions, not only with courage, but with skill The success of the Belgian efforts in Azerbaijan would mean the forging of a strong -chain of connection between the Central Government and the decentralised province, for as long as the hand that holds the purse works at the bidding of Tehran, a certain influence can always be exercised by the authorities at the capital over the 8. One cannot shut one’s eyes to the fact that whether designedly or accidently, the efforts of the Russian agents in Azerbaijan during the past year have tended towards the decentralisation of the province, towards the severance of the administrative connections between Tabriz and Tehran. I bis object has invoh ed the elimination of all Persian officials too closely connected with or too loyal to the Gentral Government. To this policy w r as due the removal of Sipahdar, the late Governor- General, and of Shereef-ed-Dowleh, the ex-Karguzar, as also the opposition to the a°*ents of the central treasurv. The most important Persian agent in this scheme of decentralisation is Shuja-ed-Dowleh, the present governor-general, who, though generally looked upon as a traitor to his country, is held by some to be an unfortunate creature of circumstances, since he found himself bound hand and toot to carry out the will of Russia before he realised whither his support of the ex-Shah was leading him. Were he to endeavour to break loose to-day from the yoke of Russia, he wouldfind himself in a most precarious position. His own countrymen are unlikely to forget the harm he has done to the cause of Persian independence and constitutionalism, nor the cruelty he has displayed towards the Nationalists. Even the Reactionaries are far from well disposed towards Shuja, whom they look upon as a plebeian upstart. There is good reason to believe that he has too late realised the position in which he fir ’ himself, and that he feels keenly the humiliation of the part he is called upon to play. He has shown signs during the last year of a desire to break with the past, and it is by no means improbable that, if he felt that he could count upon British support, he would make a determined effort to do so. The Russians have doubtless understood that Shuja contemplated emancipating himself from their thraldom, because on various occasions the Russian Charge d'Affaires has told me that St. Petersburgh w’as not quite satisfied with his attitude. The knowledge that British agents in Azerbaijan could promise him no support, and the fear of seeing himself superseded by Sardar Reshid, a still more slavish Russian tool, has apparently made Shuja make a complete submission to Russia, since M. Sabline’s later remarks about him would appear to show that his Government has recovered their confidence in him. 9. This state of semi-autonomy under Russian suzerainty in which we find the province of Azerbaijan would not seem to have made for a very satisfactory condition of affairs as regards the civil administration. After a brief spell of, at least, an effort to encourage a tendency towards a moral and mental enlightenment of the people, Azerbaijan appears to have gone back to the state of affairs which existed under the Governorship of Mohammed Ali Mirza. The officials, from Shuja-ed-T)owleh down wards, made no secret of accepting bribes. Office is bought and sold by public auction, whilst suitors cannot hope to obtain even a hearing in the tribunals without previously and publicly bribing their judges. The deputy Governors rule with the oppressive, arbitrary methods of the days of despotism, and the old barbarous punish ments are in full force. Some allowance may be made in Persia for the necessity in some oases for exemplary punishments, but no reasons of expediency can justity the wanton cruelty displayed by Shuja-ed-Dowleh at Tabriz. There can be no need to-day, in a town that is absolutely quiet, and indeed incapable of revolt, to lead men through the bazaars with cords through their noses, or to beat others almost to death for trifling offences, and yet such things are of frequent occurrence. It is unfortunate that such crimes should be committed by a man who is the acknowledged nominee of Russia, under the very eyes of the Russian authorities, and that no effort should be made to put a stop to the cruelty, the oppressive arbitrariness and corruption of Persian officials who are completely under their influence. 10. The Russian occupation of the province has, however, secured for the people of Azerbaijan a measure of order such as they have not known for many years. The outlying districts have been generally free from brigandage and disorder, a state of affairs that is naturally much appreciated by native and foreign merchants alike. There is reason to believe that at first the Russian occupation was far from unpopular with the people. It released them from fedai terrorism, and gave them peace after years of strife. Gradually the disadvantages of foreign domination began to occur to the native mind, and it is probable that to-day few, if any, Persians have much enthusiasm for the present state of affairs. But, although the Persian does not like the Russian, the vast majority of the population of Azerbaijan has resigned itself to the inevitable, and acquiesces philosophically in a domination which is looked upon as permanent. Large numbers of the inhabitants now learn Russian, study in Russian schools, and send tiieir sons to Russia to be educated. Tabriz has assumed the appearance of a Russian town, and Russian customs and institutions are gradually modifying the mentality of the native population. 11. Complaints are constant that Russian officials are endeavouring to stifle European trade in Azerbaijan. The arguments used in support of this contention are that Russia is putting a stop to the parcel post, and that attempts are being made to render the Trebizond route impossible. It is likely that the stoppage of the parcel post service will do more harm to German, French, and Italian trade than to British, and it is even thought in some quarters that its disappearance will cause the small traders, who now more especially make use of it, to have recourse to the British firms, who alone are in a position to carry on an extensive importation of European goods bjr the Trebizond route. For this reason any attempt to tamper with this route would seriously affect British trade interests. It is asserted that the manner in which difficulties are placed in the way of trade using this route is by the commandeering r generally in the neighourhood of Khoi, of passing mules for military transport. Muleteers thus commandeered are obliged to abandon their loads of merchandise in6 there is nothin' else to take its place, and hopeless disorder would inevitably ensue It now remains to be seen, not only whether Russia will or can extricate herselt irom Azerbaijan, but whether she will not find herself hurried by the same force or circum stances as has imperilled her good name in that province, with the help of the same over-zealous consular official into a policy of adventure into the more westfv-i. provinces of Persia lying south of Azerbaijan. Her troops have already reached e south-western extremity of the above-named province, and the * Mother, h/arey chickens ” that presage further Russian political penetration have already made their appearance. Kurdistan, Kermanshah, and Luristan are all three in a state ol hopeless disorder that must be rectified at no distant date. Shuja-ed-Dowleh, the Russian tool, who would certainly take no action on his own initiative without the sanction of the Russian consulate-general at Tabriz, has proposed that Kurdistan should be added to the districts alreadv in his charge. Far man Farma, the Governor-General ot Kermanshah, whom it is impossible not to hold, in a large measure responsible tor the continued disordered state of his province, is so strongly supported by Russia that the Russian Charge d’Affaires here has not thought it unwise to inform a seeker after his succession that his Government will never allow his Highness to be removed. Much will depend upon whether or not Russia will allow the gendarmes under their Swedish officers to restore order, or whether it will be argued that the gendarmerie is intended for other parts of Persia, and that Persian Cossacks are the proper force to be employed in the Russian zone. Such a contention would be equivalent to an open avowal that Russia does not wish order to be re-established m that particular part of the country in which British interests suffer perhaps more than those of any other nation from the continued disorders on the Bagdad trade route. The ability of the Cossacks to carrv out the work is doubted by everyone, whilst their true loyalty eO their own country is under grave suspicion. They were never intended to serve any other purpose than to propagate a Russian propaganda, and w hatever else rnay lave changed in Persia, no one can accuse what is familiarly known as Ibe Brigade of having failed in carrying out the duty for which it was originally imposed upon Persia, whilst making the least possible practical return to the country for all the monev that has been lavished on it even when times wu&gt;re hardest. . , . 15. Allusion has been made above to the illegal alienation of Crown lands in Azerbaijan to Russian subjects and to Russian protected persons. The most flagrant case was that of the Jabbeh Khaneh at Tabriz, when a large piece of ground in the centre of the town, and in immediate proximity to the citadel, the seat of Government when ordinary conditions prevailed, was forcibly sold under the hldd ^ l/J 68811 ’ 0 , the Russian consulate, for about 1,600L, its real value being about It had been argued that this action of the Russian authorities will really be tor the good of Tabriz, because the piece of ground in question which has long remained waste, and was the site of the death of the eeclesiastico-social reformer known as the « Bab ” will now he built over. Such an argument, however plausible, can haidiy suffice to condone the alienation of a valuable Crown property against the wish ot the Government. This alienation of Crown lands is not confined to Azerbaijan, but is common in all the northern provinces in which the Russian consuls not only reign supreme, but entirely ignore the presence and instructions ot the legation at Tehran. The Russian Chargd d’Affaires has himself stated that ail the Russian officials in the Province of Astrabad, for instance, down to the most insignificant telegraph clerk, have become large landed proprietors with entire disregard of the fact that under the Treaty of Turkomanchai foreigners cannot hold land in Persia, other than what is necessary for business or residential purposes in the towns Another bitter complaint against Russian methods in force in the northern parts ot Persia is that, with the encouragement of the consuls, no Russian subject or protected persons pay taxes. It is said that in Gilan they pay the taxes into the Russian consulate against certain claims against the Persian Government, but if such is the case, the Treasurer-General is kept in complete ignorance of the amount ot taxes collected, and neither knows against what claim they are set ofi or how the money is disposed of. It is said that orders have been issued from St. Petersburg!) that the taxes are to be paid by Russian subjects, but it seems likely that, if such an order has been issued, it will remain as dead a letter as the order issued some a me ago to the effect that the commander of the Cossack Brigade should render accounts to the proper authoritory of the Government. i * u 10.

In such places as Astrabad the consul is all f“®’. sees on f but his own subordinates, or officers of the Russian troops across tlie ronher, with whom he is in constant contact, and only knows Tehran as a sort of ytl ical town that lies somewhere behind the mountain ramre at his hack, which he has not only never crossed, but never intends to cross. This excuse mav hold srood for flnm St ‘ 1C u ln 116 N n rth ’ but 11 can hardl y a PPly to Ispahan, where I 'have gathered om my Russian colleague, the consuls show an equal predilection for following their own opinions as to those iu the north. , 17 ' 7 'Ae Government —After lengthy negotiations Ala-es-8ultaneh succeeded in i ming a Cabinet upon the acceptance by the Regent, who was in Paris at the time, of bamsam-es-buitaneh s resignation. Included in the new Administration were all the best political elemente that Persia can produce to day, and it was confidently hoped that much good work would result. It was, however, felt from the first that there was much divergence oi political views among the various new' Ministers, and fears wore early expressed that their co-operation would be of but short duration. Although it was essential to secure the presence of the two brothers, Motamen-ul-Mulk and Mushir- ed-Gowleh, in the Cabinet, in order that the powerful interests which are behind them migli! give their countenance to the granting of the proposed railway concessions, Inli i i Pe .','n S 1I ’? ul 8 ed &gt;« that these two reliable statesmen, whose political ambitions . ar uglier than the possibility of their realisation under existing circumstances would long continue to give their colleagues the benefit of their reading and experience. Such unfortunately proved to he the case. Motamen-ul-Mulk only entered the Cabinet wmdd he 6 f^ “Tk 01 an T U ?, nCe , tlmt the S rantin 8 of the milway concessions il l lie followed by a considerable advance from the twm Governments which would ?!!rZr rt t0 ^ e ma t de an extensive programme of reforms which he elaborated, fiOOOOi fi^r 11 ? wluch would require the raising of a large loan of some C 000,0001 Although from the first he seldom attended the Cabinet Councils, he P 11S fi° l e ?p ues anf l P rom ^ se un til the railway questions were settled. H iieii he saw that there was but small chance of the advance of J00 000L made by the two Governments being followed at an early date bv a loan, he resigned. He was shortly afterwards followed into retirement by his brother, on the plea that his iiealth necessitated his going to Europe. The two departments rendered vacant by the resignations of the brothers remained in the charge of Under Secretaries during the remainder of the year. n 18. Other inevitable differences soon hei?an to make themselves felt. Relations became very strained between Vossugh-ed-Dowleh, the Minister for Foreign Affairs anr Am-ed-Dowleh, the Minister of the Interior. Curiously enough the latter had absolutely refused to join the Cabinet unless the former was Minister for Foreign Affairs, a post which the veteran Prime Minister much coveted for himself. The cause of the trouble between the two above-named Ministers was Russia’s attitude upon various questions m which the Foreign Minister was obliged bv his position to •appear to be bringing forward questions which were especially disagreeable to the limster of the Interior, who, in spite of his assurances to the* contrary, has never really been able to quite adapt himself to the social change that has occurred as a result of the constitutional revolution. The former Sadr-Azam and Kaiar Prince cannot always remember that he must forget that certain of his colleagues in the Cabinet won their political spurs in the humble position of his munshi, or secretarv when they who to-day must be given equal rank with himself would hardly have presumed to sit in his presence, even though bidden to do so. The strained relations between the two Ministers reached such a pitch at last that it was clear that one or other of them must resign. The Minister for Foreign Affairs made the first move perhaps in tne belief that Russian support would really force Ain-ed-Dowleh to be the one to go As Vossugh-ed-Dowleh pleaded ill-health as the reason for his givin' up nis portfolio, it was possible to so arrange the matter that his Excellency kept his post and merely took leave to go to Europe. At the moment when the split came it wouki have been most undesirable to have a general Cabinet crisis, and in British interests it was much to be hoped that Ain-ed-Dowleh would not leave the Cabinet as Jus Highness was loyally co-operating in the carrying out of measures connected iui those parts of Persia in which they predominate, and which there is good reason to hope will bear good fruit for British trade.19. The departure of Vossugh-ed-Dowleh left the Foreign Office in the hands of an under-sec rotary, and not very much later the War Office found itself in the same position, the Minister, Mustaufi-ul-Mamalek being sent to Europe with a mission to bring back the Kegent, whose prolonged absence in Paris was bringing bis high office into disrepute, provoking much unfavourable comment about himself, and opening the door to the intrigues of those who were ambitious to fill his shoes. Thus by the month of June all that w T as left of the Cabinet were the Prime Minister, the Minister of the Interior, and three junior Ministers, of whom the only one of any importance was the Minister of Finance, the brother of the absent Minister for Foreign Affairs, and a former private secretary of Ain-ed-Dowleh. The three products of constitu tional Persia worked assiduously to bring about the fall of the old prince, their former master, and there is but small doubt that they were strongly egged on in the opposi tion, both by the Regent, who was in constant touch with one of them through the Persian Minister in Paris, his brother, and by Vossugh-ed-Dowleh himself. Although he frequently absented himself in a temper from the Cabinet meetings, and resigned more than once, Ain-ed-Dowleh weathered the storm, and still rules at the Ilome Office. I am of opinion that, w r ith all his faults and, despite the fact that he deserted his post on more than one occasion at a most critical moment, we and Persia have every reason to be glad that his Highness has occupied the most important position in the State during the year under review. 20. I unhesitatingly assert that no one knows his own country and its people so well as Ain-ed-Dowleh, who has a surprising knowledge of all the factors in every movement on foot, with such a perfect acquaintance with all the details of every little question that it makes negotiations with his Highness a much easier task than with someone who has to he initiated into the inner history of the matter in hand. My experience has been that one can put a situation frankly before his Highness with perfect confidence that he will suggest a solution that is most likely to have good results, and be beneficial both to British and to Persiart interests, because be will suggest a way of carrying it out in a manner that is calculated to give the satisfaction sought, without arousing ill-feeling or wounding susceptibilities. We have much reason to be grateful for the manner in which Ain-ed-Dowleh helped in summoning Shauket-ul-Mulk and Hashmet-ul-Mulk to Tehran, and in the steps taken to reach a settlement of a question that has long given the British consular officers in Seistan constant trouble and annovance. The arrangement made will be dealt with later on in this report, as wull also the general situation in Pars, but whilst on the subject of Ain-ed-DowlelPs tenure of office, it seems but right to state that, wffiilst giving all the credit that is due to Mukhber-es-Sultaneh and to the gendarmerie for the approved state of affairs, I am convinced that the attitude of the local personages of impor tance, such as Kavam-ul-Mulk and Soulet-ed-Dowleh, has been in no small measure influenced by the weight that the prince’s name carries with it. If his Highness has appeared at times to be not entirely cordial in his support of the Swedish officers, the fault has not always been his. The Swedes must occasionally have been very irritating in the manner in which they have taken the iaw r into their own bands without consulting the Minister to wffiom they are under the terms of their contracts specially responsible. There have certainly been occasions upon which they have done w ell not to risk a check to their plans by a reference to the prince, who they had reason to believe would wish them to act in a w r ay that was at variance with their scheme, but one must all the same make allowance for a not unnatural irritation on the prince’s part on such occasions. I think that Ain-ed-Dowleh has come to under stand the situation, and there is ground for hope that in future, misunderstandings will he of rarer occurrence, for I am sure that the Minister fully realises the impor tance to Persia of the gendarmerie, and is genuinely anxious to help in the execution of the work which the Swedes have in hand. 21. Although the Cabinet appeared to be little more than a name all the summer, the) coped successfully with a most aw r kward question when the incident between the gendarmes and the Bakhtiaris occurred in the month of August, and the improvement in the state of the country must, in all fairness, be put to their credit. The steps taken in the summer by certain politicians to force the hand of the Cabinet in the matter of proceeding to ncw r elections for a Medjliss were not calculated to make their task easier. It w r fis abundantly evident that these peisons were not really anxious to see a new' Medjiiss called together, hut that they hoped to gain a measure of public popularity by pushing the Government into taking action, wffiich, though in strict accord with the requirements of the Constitution, was not genuinely desired by anyone. Samsam-es-Sultaneh, the former Prime Minister, was persuaded to putshown'^nQ 1 such IZtf “j 6 m ° V ?P en n 5’ d . es l&gt; ite tbe fact tbat '^en in office he had found ; , (?

A tumult, which had clearly been f n re f n!f d 7 ad ' ance ’ tben arose and a fiery priest abused the Regent and tbe Cabinet l,.ft t f ' tu P eratlve 'anguage.

' blcb bipabdar took part, nothing happened, and what was a one-day subject oi conversation was entirely forgotten in a week. ^ 22. Previously to the return of the Regent from Paris in September the relations e.ween the members of the Cabinet had been far from cordial. On his Highness’s resumption of office he succeeded in re-establishing at least a semblance of concord Ihe calmer atmosphere was however, soon disturbed, as had been foreseen, by the rotuin of \ ossugh-ed- Dowleh from Europe. The Minister for Foreign Affairs had gone on leave because he could not get on with Ain-ed-TJowleh. It was soon 7? a rf- ’ de / p ‘ t ? bls assaran ces to the contrary, that foreign air had not only not icd him of .ns complaint, but that he had been paid such flattering compliments by certain people in Europe, notably by M. Sazonof, that he had come hack with the idea that he was all powerful, and could do what he liked. The intrigues against Ain-ed-l)owleh recommenced with redoubled ardour, and all sorts of stories' 5 were seduously circulated to the Prince’s detriment. The Russian Legation affected to elieve these stories which were of a most improbable nature, and the Regent could M.Ltnfi l vr te “P ta 7 n t0 bave a fling at an old enemy, of whom he is very jealous. Mustofi-el-MamaJek who returned from Europe in September at the same time as the fu ' ra advccate of the Ain-ed-Dowleh, and openly stated that he ., r d „ 0W i!' 0 ]/ rir * ce s example, if he resigned, a similar declaration being made one hot 7777 i77 : Tbe ! ltuation at the elld of the year was a most unsettled one, but an actual Cabinet crisis was avoided. 23. Gendarmerie. An incident, to which allusion has been made above, and which [361] Dmight have had the most serious results, was that which occurred between the gendarmes and the Bakhtiaris in the early part of August. For a long time there had been no small amount of ill-feeling between the two bodies, as was only to be expected, when it is realised that the former were constantly called upon to take action against t^^ latter in the performance of their every-day duties. I he Bakhtiaris, although . that time a recognised Government force, were little better than robbers who oppressed the villagers in the neighbourhood ot Tehran, as was the custom of all the irregular forces before the coming of the gendarme. In their efforts to persuade the Bakhtiari freebooters that they were not carrying out their proper duties in despoiling all the unfortunate villagers that came within their reach, the gendarmes naturally clashed with their interests. The tribesmen stored up their grievances against the gendarmes, whilst the latter much resented the fact that, as long as Sardar Mohtashem was Minister of War, any Bakhtiaris arrested on the roads, and sent into Tehran for punishment invariably reappeared in their old haunts, and at their old tricks in a day or two, without having suffered any punishment at the hand of their tribal ilbegi. Numerous small collisions had prepared those watching the course of events ior some serious incident, and but little surprise was, therefore, felt when the news reached us in the country that the gendarmes and the Bakhtiaris were fighting in town. I i© cause of the quarrel was a small one, but any spark would have sufficed, seeing that the moment had come when the two rival forces had to make a trial of strength, a trial that could only end one way, unless the Persian Government was prepared to sacrifice ail the money expended upon the organisation of the gendarmerie and see a good work begun so w r ell come to an untimely end. r l he position was no easy °^ e » either for the Government, which could not forget in a moment all the services that the Bakhtiaris had rendered the cause of the Constitution in Persia, or for the two legations which w T ere morally bound to advise that all possible support should be given to the force commanded by alien officers, a fact that in itself predisposed the Cabinet in favour of the Bakhtiaris, despite the unpopularity that they had acquired m the country. For a time the Cabinet wavered, and, had it not been for representations made bv the two legations in the nick of time, it is more than probable that the fate of the gendarmerie would have been sealed, and Persia would have lost the services of a force that promises to assist largely in the regeneration of the country. T inally an arrangement w as reached, under which it w r as agreed that the number of Bakhtiaris in Tehran should be reduced from 950 to 300, and that they should not carry arms except when on duty, or accompanying the carriages of the chief khans, each one of whom was to have a carriage escort of four men. It was further agreed that the men who w T ere to leave r lt‘hran should do so in detaenments of thirty at time, with their arms, and that those who remained behind should be formed into a properly constituted regiment, he regularly paid, and be housed in barracks provided by the Government. . . ... 24. To the Sw r edes belongs great credit for the courage and determination with which they carried out the military operations w T hich might have ended very badly for them had 'the khans put themselves at the head of their men, or had one or two of the foreign officers been killed in the street fighting that took place. They aiso showed praiseworthy forbearance, when it was pointed out to them that they could not be accorded all the reparation they considered themselves entitled to. Still, m my opinion, even greater credit is due to the khans who accepted, with marked dignity, a most painful situation in a manner which indicated true loyalty to their country s interests. One has but to put oneself in their place for a moment to realise what it meant to them. They had played a most prominent part in all the events which had resulted in the expulsion of the ex-Shah from Persia; they had fought against him when e returned; they had defended the country against Salar-ed-Dowleh; and the wheel of riolitical fortune had brought them to high office, several of them having been Cabinet Ministers, whilst one of their nnmber had been the last Prime Minister. I hen, out of an incident, w ith a force commanded by foreign officers, they were to see themselves humbled, by their tribesmen being disarmed in the face of all 1 ersia, &lt;* n d their numbers at the capital reduced, as if they had been mere malefactors instead ot men who had served their country well It was easy to see from the faces of the khans when I called upon them, with a view* to inducing them to accept the inevitable humiliation which had come to them, how deeply they felt the bitterness ol the situation, and yet, at a word from their blind chief, Sardar Assad, himself stricken with a mortal illness, they agreed to do as 1 should advise them. I sketched what seemed to me reasonable conditions of an arrangement. They accepted, and to their credit be it said, they loyally carried out the terms of the agreement made on the lines 1 had suggested withoccurred between the gendarmes a long time there had been no was only to be expected, when it pon to take action against the The Bakhtiaris, although Ter than robbers who oppressed he custom of all the irregular fforts to persuade the Bakhtiari per duties in despoiling all the be gendarmes naturally clashed ievances against the gendarmes, &gt;ng as Sardar Mohtashem was &gt;ads, and sent into Tehran for and at their old tricks in a day the hand of their tribal ilbegi. g the course of events for some , felt when the news reached us is were fighting in town. The rould have sufficed, seeing that ad to make a trial of strength, a I Government was prepared to n of the gendarmerie and see a The position was no easy one, a moment all the services that itution in Persia, or for the two possible support should be given n itself predisposed the Cabinet that they had acquired in the it not been for representations tore than probable that the fate •sia would have lost the services 3 ration of the country. Finally :d that the number of Bakhtiaris at they should not carry arms of the* chief khans, each one of It vas further agreed that the stachments of thirty at a time, ehind should be formed into a be housed in barracks provided courage and determination with might have ended very badly for dr men, or had one or two of the t took place. They also showed :o them that they could not be entitled to. Still* in my opinion, }d, wfith marked dignity, a most yalty to their country’s interests, lent to realise what it meant to II the events which had resulted id fought against him when he ir-ed-Dowleh; and the wheel of eral of them having been Cabinet last Prime Minister. Then, out leers, they were to see themselves ie face of all Persia, and their uere malefactors instead of men e from the faces of the khans when accept the inevitable humiliation tterncss of the situation, and yet, elf stricken with a mortal illness, ed what seemed to me reasonable to their credit be it said, they on the lines I had suggested with the Government. That when the time came to make a tally of the numbers of their men who had left Tehran it was found that they could only produce 350 instead of 05O was a mere detail. It w r as a secret de polichinelle that they had for long had nothing like the number of men at Tehran for which the Government had been made ■'O pay* At first the colonel commanding the gendarmerie was disposed to insist upon all the Bakhtiaris in the town leaving, in order to make up the number agreed upon, but he soon yielded to reason and a disagreeable incident was closed in an amicable manner. The Government, however, did not keep their part of the bargain. The men who remained have not been paid regularly, barracks have not been provided for them, and they have not been constituted into a regular regiment. 25. This brings me to a review of the work of the gendarmerie during what may he fairly considered their second year of existence. A t the end of 1912 there w T ere twenty-one Swedish instructors in Persia, with a force of about 3,000 men ; by the end of the following year their numbers have been increased to thirty-six Swedish instructors and 5,400 Persian officers and men. This again is a nominal figure, and there is good reason to believe that their numbers are really considerably in excess of 6,000 men. The results of the first year’s work had been sufficiently satisfactory in the immediate neighbourhood of the capital to allow one to indulge in sanguine hopes that their ultimate success was assured, provided that the necessary funds were forth coming tor their upkeep. A proof of the high appreciation they had won at the hands of the Persians themselves was furnished by the fact that when the British and Bussian Governments made an advance of 400,000/. to Persia in the spring of 1913, the Persian Ministers, without any condition being made by the lending Powers, themselves set aside out of the money advanced over 100,000/., to be devoted to the service of the gendarmerie. With this money and tlie advance of 100,000/. made by His Majesty’s Government for the special requirements of the gendarmerie in the province of Pars, it has been found possible to pay the men regularly and provide all the necessary requisites to ensure a gradual development of the force. It will be a real disaster if the work so well begun should now he brought to naught by want of funds to carry it on. 26. During 1912 the work of the gendarmes was necessarily restricted to the Tehran district, and such operations as were undertaken further afield, as for instance, in the neighbourhood of Shiraz, did not meet with signal success. The same need not, fortunately, he said of the work done in 1913. The situation round Tehran lias been strengthened and confirmed; the road from the capital to Hamadan, via Kasvin, has been so successfully taken possession of that the power of the robber bands who infested it has been completely broken ; operations have been extended as far as Menjeel on the Resht road, whilst preparations have been made for placing posts all the way to Enzeli; the road to Sultana had, via Koom, has been occupied, and when the Regent returned to Persia a force of 500 men patrolled the entire length of the road between Enzeli and Tehran. In the months of March and April last 1,000 men were despatched, in two detachments, to Shiraz; and in September 200 men, with four Swedish officers, were sent to Kerman, where they arrived without any incident, in spite of some apprehension felt as to the nature of the reception they might meet with at Kerman, where there was a Bakhtiari Governor with a force of some 500 or 600 men. It was found impossible, owing to climatic conditions, for the gendarmes sent to Shiraz to take over the Bushire road in the spring, as had been intended, but they went down the road as far as Bushire, and convoyed up without disaster a large consignment of arms and ammunition which had been awaiting a safe escort for some time. The colonel commanding the entire force went down to Bushire with the first detachment and made certain arrangements with the chiefs on the road, which srave rise to some comment, because it was feared lest he might have committed himseft to some undertaking which he never intended to keep, such as would lay him open to a charge of bad faith. Colonel, now General, Hjalmarson always stoutly denied that he had done any such thing, and repudiated the insinuation that a Swedish officer could be capable of taking an unfair advantage, even of the truculent blackguards on the Bushire road. I think it may be safely said tiiat subsequent events have proved that he spoke the truth. 27. Although the gendarmes were unable to take any definite steps towards the restoration of order in the spring, the state of affairs in the province of Ears showed a steady improvement during the summer Kavam-ul-Mulk undertook energetic and successful military measures against certain of the unruly tribesmen, in the course of which he had occasion to wipe the eye of Major Siefvert, whose command at Shiraz was not signalised by success. It may be doubted if Kavam-ul-Mulk would have shown such unusual energy had not the presence in the province of a large gendarmerie force brought it home to him that the Central Government was worth respecting. Major Siefvert was subsequently recalled to Tehran, and the command at Shiraz was entrusted to Major Cggla. In November preparations were made to take possession of the road, and for that purpose a mixed force of 800 men left Shiraz. All went well at first, and the celebrated Mohamed Ali Khan, Kashguli,. handed over the district of Shapur, which he had held for some time illegally, without striking a blow. Ali Mohamed Khan, Kamaredji, however, made a stand in a fortified position, which the gendarmes surrounded, but from which, by some inex plicable blunder, they allowed him to escape with all his men, baggage animals, and some women, although a bright moon made the night as light as day. Leaving a small force at Kazeroun, the column proceeded down the road towards Bushire, establishing posts as they went. Before their destination was reached, news was received that, in consequence of the high-handed action of the men left at Kazeroun, Ali Mohamed had succfieded in inducing the people to rise against them, and that nearly all the gendarmes in the neighbourhood, to the number of over 100 had had to take refuge in the telegraph office, many of them having been stripped and deprived of their arms. A relief column immediately returned, and after some hesitation, which caused no small anxiety, due to uncertainty about the state of affairs in their rear, they fought their way back to Kazeroun against heavy odds and over very difficult country with much skill and gallantry. Order was completely re-established, but unfortunately Ali Mohamed again managed to escape, and was still at large at the end of the year, and will remain a menace until he has been captured and executed, a fate which he has earned, both in consequence of his resistance to the gendarmes and because he was one of the chief culprits in the attack upon Mr. Consul Smart. 28. In September the gendarmes again distinguished themselves in another direction. After taking over the road from Koom to Sultanabad, a force only 200 strong made a sudden attack upon the Lur tribes, which had been threatening Sultanabad all the summer, and doing much damage in the country lying between that place and Hamadan. The raid was pushed right up to Burujird, which was entered. Unfortunately the gendarmes were not in sufficient strength to carry out the entire operation which had been iutended, and on the general of the Cossacks refusing to support them with the men he had at Hamadan, they had to retire. Their with drawal somewhat spoilt the effect of the punitive measure which they had carried out, but a large number of the enemy were killed and others taken prisoner, of whom several were subsequently executed. It lias been brought up against the gendarmes that the raid had no lasting effect, and for that reason did more harm than good, and that many innocent persons suffered. It is evident that on such occasions the innocent must often suffer, but those who were punished were where they had no right to be, under suspicious circumstances, and the raid of last year w ill be followed up by a much more important movt^ment, which it is intended shall make the Lurs feel the strength of the Central Government. Elsewhere in the country the work was carried on successfully. One heard occasional complaints of isolated acts, but in general the verdict of all who came into contact with the gendarmes was a favourable one, and many people spoke of the marked improvement to be noticed on the roads. A sign of the effect that the gendarmerie is having on the country is the fact that a number of the freebooters who have scorned the power of the Government for a lengthy period are making their submission and seeking to re-enter into grace. Among them I need onlyeite the celebrated terror of Kashan, the famous Naib Hussain and his sons, whom both Bakhtiaris and Cossacks have failed to reduce to order, and who once even dared to disarm and rob some Russian soldiers on the road between Tehran and Ispahan. 29. Treasury-General .—In spite of innumerable obstacles, the next most important institution under European direction, the Einancial administration, has continued to make good progress. The revenues collected show a steady increase, and little by little the Belgians, under M. Mornard, are making themselves felt. It is but natural that they are not popular with the local authorities, since their duties oblige them to take action wdiich curtails the chances previously enjoyed by all the functionaries of the State of putting money in their pockets. The difficulties encountered by the Treasury officials in the Russian zone have been dealt w r ith elsewhere in this report. They are far from being the only ones they have to face. In Tehran M. Mornard has gained the enmity of nearly all the Cabinet Ministers, although not one of them can make any definite charge against him. In the provinces his representatives have a very difficult r61e to play, they have to control the expenditure, and in so doing are brought into almost daffy conflict withis most ofthe^l^^r; ,' n 0r ^ er mal . rila ‘ n their position for which they are become nverhoir; 11 , r . 1 r, ‘ason of their social status.

The repayment of the Russian advance of 200,0001 is to commence on tbe 1st (14th) July, 1914, and will be maue m half-yearly instalments of rather more than 33,000/. each The rate of interest on these advances is 7 per cent., and they are immediately repayable out of an^ loan that the 1 ersian Government may raise prior to the date fixed for their maturing. , , 31- Railways—The above-mentioned Anglo-Russian advance of 400,0001. was made to tiie t ersian Government on the successful conclusion of the negotiations for the grant ol a railway concession to each of the two leading Powers. These negotiations were concluded m the month of February. The Russians secured the right to construct a railway on the existing carriage road between Julfa and Tabriz, with the continua- tmn ol the rights of the old road concession, which accords the concessionary some what large mining rights within a radius of 40 miles on each side of the road. The right.was also granted to the Russian company to construct a railway from Tabriz to Kazym on equal conditions with any others that might be put forward by any other applicant, and a right to make a road between those two places was renewed within certain time limits, the old concession having lapsed. Work was commenced in the course ot the year, and the line has already entered Persian territory. 32. In consequence of the Persian railways syndicate not being in a position [361] Eto furnish certain essential details to the Persian Government to enable the latter to come to a definite decision as to the terms of the contract to be made for the construction of a line from Mohammerah or Khor Musa to Khoremabad, it was not found possible to conclude the contract, and it was decided to apply only for an option to construct the railway eventually, either as a State line for the Persian Government, or as a concession to be granted to the syndicate. A two-years option was accordingly secured, during which period a survey should be carried out of a nature to enable the Persian Government to decide whether they would ask the syndicate to build a line for them, or grant a concession for the construction of the line. The expenses incurred on the survey were to be borne by the Persian Government, in the case of the line being constructed as a State line, and by the syndicate in the case of a concession being accorded to them. The survey work was commenced in the south with the least possible loss of time, but it was not considered desirable to proceed north of Dizful until steps had been taken to secure the goodwill of the Lur tribes, through whose country the line would have to pass. For this purpose Captain A. W. Wilson, who had been named as special political officer to reside at Dizful, and who had already been over the country to be surveyed, and was in touch with the Lur chiefs, came to Tehran in September and proceeded hence to Ramadan, where he was joined by an engineer in the service of the syndicate, in order to go through the country and make the necessary arrangements w r ith the chiefs. In spite of many difficulties, Captain Wilson and his companion got safely to Dizful, where be had to part company with the Survey Commission, as he had been appointed to serve on the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission. His successor at once expressed doubts about the possibility of the arrangements Captain Wilson had made being carried out. It was soon seen that the promised hostages did not come in, and from information which reached the Commission, it appears that the Lurs were preparing to dispute their passage, with the intention af extorting heavy bribes from them. As the Persian Government were quite unable to take the necessary steps to ensure their safe passage to their destina tion, the Commission was obliged to remain at Dizful. By the terms of the option the duration of the same must be prolonged in the event of the survey being delayed by force majeure. This state of affairs was duly notified to the Persian Government, which will certainly raise no difficulties as concerns a prolongation of the time limit of the option. Meanwhile, Nizam-es-Sultaneh has been named Governor-General of Burudjird and Luristan, with the probable addition of Arabistan, and it is hoped that with his experience of the country, he may be able to restore order, provided that he is supplied with a force, gendarme or other, upon which he can rely. 33. From the date of the arrival of the large gendarmerie reinforcements at Shiraz, affairs in the province of Fars have shown marked improvement. With Ain-ed-Dowleh at the Home Office, a better Governor in Mukhber-es-Sultaneh than the usual run of Governors, and a strong gendarme force to back him, the warring elements of the province haie deemed a conciliatory attitude the best one to assume. Mukhber-e^-Sultaneh has, on the whole, so far proved himself a satisfactory Governor, although he has on occasion given some cause for dissatisfaction, especially in connection with an incident last summer, when a coloured gendarme killed a Seyyid in a street brawl. On this occasion the Governor acted in an unpardonably high handed manner, as he caused the gendarme to be executed without holding a proper enquiry, and after he had agreed with the Swedish officers that he would take no steps in the matter until after he had seen Major Uggla, w r ho was in the country a short distance from the town. His Excellency has managed to maintain good relations w r ith Kavam-ul-Mulk, w r ho has done yeoman service in inflicting punishment upon certain Arab tribes, but, as a result of his friendly attitude towards Kavam, he has aroused the suspicions of that most unsatisfactory person, Soulet-ed-Dowleh, actually ilkhani of the Kashgais. In the autumn, Mukhber made up his mind that Soulet must go, and sought the assistance of the gendarmerie to make a demonstration against him which would show him that he could not resist. General Hjalmarson was unwdlling to take the steps required of him, since Soulet had always proved himself friendly towurds the gendarmerie. He also feared that his men might become embroiled in a tribal affair. After consulting with Ain-ed-Dowleh, who has always been favourably disposed to Soulet, I agreed that it would be better to leave Soulet alone for the present, and to let action that might be taken in the spring depend upon his behaviour during the winter. Mukhber agreed to this plan, and the malcontents, among whom were Soulet’s own brothers, accepted the situation. 34. Salar-cd-Dowieh .—The past year was remarkable for the temporary eclipse, at least, of Salar-ed-Dowleh. At the end of 1912 the Prince was in Asterabad,whither he had gone after fleeing from Kermanshah, and giving Tehran a fright on the way. He was at the head of a very small force, and negotiations were in progress through the Russian Legation for accepting the rebel Prince’s submission, and appointing him Governor-General of Ghilan. The consent of the Persian Government to this arrangement was practically extorted from them by M. Poklewsky, the then Russian Minister, but before the negotiations could be concluded the elusive Prince took to the road again, and appeared in the neighbourhood of Sabsewar with a small force. In spite of the fact that the Russian officer, who had been sent from Asterabad to see that the Prince’s intentions were as peaceful as he professed, had left him because he was convinced that his Highness meditated some coup, the Russian Government for a long time held that lie was more sinned against than sinning, because there had been delay in finishing the negotiations, and insisted that the Government should still carry out their promise to send him to Resht. Further delays, which were not to the liking of the restless Prince, occurred after he had returned to the Asterabad district, and finally he took the law into his own hands and went olf towards Resht, himself by sea and the bulk of his small following by land. To the latter an untoward incident happened as they were about to pass through the extensive properties of Sipahdar. in the neighbourhood of Tunekahun. It is more than probable, indeed almost certain, that Sipahdar’s men were under orders from their master favourably disposed towards Salar, but when the latter’s forces found themselves confronted with w T hat they took to be a hostile force, they at once opened fire, with the unfortunate result for the disturbers of law and order that Sipahdar’s grandson, a boy of 14, was killed at the first discharge. A fierce battle ensued, in which Salar’s men were completely routed. On the Prince’s arrival on land at a place about a day’s march from Resht, he heard the news. Nothing daunted, he at once telegraphed to the officer commanding the Cossacks in the town that he and his men should at once come out and join him, and they would have done so had not the Persian head of the telegraphs informed Tehran of their intention. Having done so* he incontinently fled away to the British vice-consulate, spreading the dread news, as he went, that Salar was actually in possession of the town. M. Sabline, the Russian Chargd d’Affaires, who had always opposed the nomination of Salar to Resht, at once took -energetic action through the colonel commanding the Cossacks at Tehran, the general being fortunately away on leave, and the men at Resht were forbidden to join Salar. 35. Foiled at Resht, the Prince made his way via Talish to Garrous and so back to Kurdistan, avoiding all the half-hearted attempts of those who could and ought to have arrested him to do so. This time, and at the instigation of the Russian Legation which was anxious that the Cossack brigade should make some sort of a show after all the gendarmes had done, it was decided to send Cossacks under two Russian officers in pursuit. Eventually they came up with the Prince in Kurdistan, after having followed him for some time. The Prince came into camp and surrendered, but after staying three days with his Russian hosts, he apparently tired of his bargain, and left them, on the pretext that he wished to go and see a sick friend in the neighbourhood, giving his word of honour that he would return without fail that evening. He did not do so, but sent a letter instead in which he said that he had decided to try his luck once more. After a further period of wandering among the tribes on the Turco- Persian frontier, he realised that he could not collect a fresh army and decided to eome into Kermanshah, and take sanctuary in the Russian consulate. From that moment the game was up for him, but through Russian intervention he managed to secure fair terms from the Persian Government, and finally left the country for Switzerland, where he is to reside, a pensioner, with his pension paid monthly through the Russian Legation. He was escorted to Kazvin by the Cossacks, and was there met by a member of the Russian Legation who accompanied him to Resht and Enzeli, where he was handed over to a Russian officer who was specially detailed to meet him and escort him as far as the Russian frontier. He assured the Russian secretary that he would go to Switzerland for a rest, but that he should certainly come back to Persia in the spring, probably by the south. Some colour is given to this idea by the fact that he has tried to open negotiations with the Bakhtiaris, without success. 36. Provinces .—As has been shown earlier in this report, the Bakhtiaris have lost no small amount of their position in the country during the past year. With the advent of the gendarmerie as a military factor of no mean importance, and with the disappear ance of the stormy petrels, such as Salar and the ex-Shah, there is no longer the same need of their military assistance. Still they must remain for long yet a factor to be -counted with, and it would not be to British interests tc see them entirely disappearfrom the stage. The state of affairs in their own country has been a fairly satisfactory one during the past year. With Sardar Jang as ilkani there have been no robberies on the road between Ahwaz and Ispahan, but the quarrels amongst the khans themselves would appear to have been bitter. Their difference with the Sheikh of Mohammerah has been dealt with separately, and it only remains to be noted that the arrangement reached appears to be working well, and that there is no apparent reason to fear a recrudescence next spring of friction between the two parties. The chief trouble has been a quarrel between Sardar Jang and Morteza Kuli Khan, son of Samsam-es-Sultaneh, the ilbeggi associated with him under the agreement of 1912, which has otherwise worked well. The difficulty has in a measure been got over by the recall of Morteza, and his replacement by his cousin Amiri Jang, formerly Zia-es- Sultan, a son of Sardar Assad. 37. In the course of last summer the question of a successor to Sardar Ashjaa, as Governor-General of Ispahan, arose. The natural candidate appeared to be Sardar Zaffar, who had held the post before Sardar Ashjaa. In view of the fact that he had proved himself a most rapacious Governor, and that there was reason to believe that, if he was made Governor, Sardnr Jang to whom he owed a large sum of money would not remain at his post, I approached M. Sabline with the view to ascertain whether the Russian Government would have any objection to the appointment of Samsam-es- Sultaneh, a former Prime Minister and ilkhani of the Bakhtiari, until Jang was appointed. M. Sabline ascertained that his Government would have no objection to the appointment, which I accordingly recommended to the Persian Government. Prom the first it met with most determined opposition from the khans themselves, as I had anticipated would be the ease, on the ground that under a family compact Samsam could not go to Ispahan. I represented to them that the interests of the State must come before any family compact, that such an instrument could not be recognised on the present occasion, and that it was essential in their own interests that a comparatively speaking honest man, like Samsam, should go to Ispahan to retrieve the deplorably bad name for the Bakhtiaris that his two predecessors had acquired by their shameless peculations and despoliation of the people. All the khans present in Tehran accepted the arguments, and promised to desist from their opposition, provided that Sardar Mohtashem, a former Minister of War in Samsam’s Cabinet and a cousin of the latter, should be appointed to succeed Amiri Mufakham, his brother, as Governor at Kerman. I agreed to this appointment as it was almost impossible not to do so, and the Amir, by his actions at Kerman about the same time, made it essential, in the opinion of His Majesty’s consul there, that he should be relieved of that post. Nevertheless, up to the end of the year the intrigues against Samsam’s appointment were unceasing. At Ispahan itself they w r ere fostered by the Russian consulate, who would have preferred Sardar Zaffar, with whom they knew how to deal, and by the sons of the Zil-es-Sultan, who since they, with their father’s properties, under the arrangement with the Russian Bank enjoy a considerable measure of Russian protection, aspire once more to play a political r61e, and no longer fear the dreaded power of their blood enemies, the Bakhtiaris of the ilkhani family. 38. Thanks to the presence of Ain-ed-Dowleh at the Home Office it was possible to deal a heavy blow at Hashmat-ul-Mulk, against whom for some years past serious complaints have been made by successive British consuls in Seistan, where he acted as Governor in the name of his father, Hissam-ed-Dowleh, whose health prevented his carrying out the duties of the office entrusted to him. At my instigation, Ain-ed- Dowleh summoned Hashmat to Tehran, but that it might not appear too marked an attack upon him, the Prince suggested that all the three important members of the family should be summoned, namely, Hissam-ed-Dowleh and Shauket-ul-Mulk, Governor of the Kainat, as well as Hashmat. I agreed on condition that Shauket, who has always behaved well, should not suffer. The three did not respond very cordially to the summons, and eventually it was decided to excuse Hissam from coming on account of his age and ill-health. The first to make a start was Shauket, and his departure from Birjand it was endeavoured by partisans of Hashmat to prevent by a too friendly demonstration of grief on the part of the people at his leaving them. He reached Tehran early in October, and w T as followed about three weeks later by Hashmat, who endeavoured by various devices to run out of the course on the way ; first at Meshed, where he was turned back by the Governor-General, by the Ain’s orders. I gave Shauket a cordial welcome, and arranged with the Regent that he would do the same. To Hashmat, who hesitated for some time before coming to call upon me, which I insisted upon his doing with his uncle Shauket, I gave a cold reception, and at once told him the nature of our complaints against him.

Ihe question ol the I urco-Persian frontier is treated in the next section of this repor , and it wu 1 sufhee to add that the Persians resolutely refuse to see that they have O ot an especially good bargmn, and it required no small amount of pressure on the part Prime 6 Miniitfr^tHnT^^f ^ oodw . i11 of the ^gent and ila-es-Sultaneh, P the me Minister, to induce the Cabinet to give their consent. Among the reasons for felT^hafTi^p 114 att 'p Udc may ’ 1 think ’ be 00unted the fact that some resentment was felt that the Persian Government was not consulted sooner as a Government and that their consent appeared to be taken for granted. crovernmenl, and that II.— Turco-Persian Prontier, 1913. had arrival b ®S inni “o °f the year the Mixed Commission sitting at Constantinople co onerathn nf 0° debnl ‘ e . de . clsl0 “. “d the Russian Government asked for the co operation of Great Britain in order to bring matters to a conclusion, eoin^ so far of TV^T 4 . u'm tbe - 1&gt;erslau Government should be asked to denounce the protocol of December 1911, owing to the dilatoriness of the Porte protocol anH I^, 1 l^ eg £ t ' a v lon ? , ho4vevcr &gt; which ensued at Constantinople between the British “ d lta P °* '» ° th '. 1* ^ &amp; cn ? ra l line forming the basis for actual delimitation on the ground arrived at. ® was2. It was agreed that the above line should be actually delimited by a frontier Commission composed of representatives of Turkey, Persia, Great Britain, and Russia. No official communications had been made to the Persian Government as regards the negotiations at Constantinople. They had, however, been kept informed of the general progress of the latter, and the British and Russian representatives at Tehran had made various semi-official communications in order to enable the Persian Government to make the necessary preparations. On tfie 27th October the British and Russian Ministers at Tehran presented a joint note to the Persian Government urging the importance of accepting without reserve the favourable settlement which had been arrived at, and of naming without delay the Commission to represent Persia on the frontier. On the 17th November the Persian Government replied to the above note in a satisfactory manner, making reserves, however, as to the navigation of the fehatt-el- Arab, and expressing the hope that special attention would be given to the question of the migratory tribes in the Zohab district. The protocol was signed at Constantinople on the 18th November by the repre sentatives of the four Powers, the Persian Ambassador, however, making no reservations in consequence of faulty telegraphic instructions from Tehran. The terms of the protocol are briefly as follows :— 1. The line to form the basis of delimitation is laid down. This line for purposes of description may be conveniently divided into four sections :— (o.) Prom Mount Ararat to Zohab, a section in which Russian (strategic) interests predominate; (6.) Prom Zohab to Mendeli, where it is understood that Turkey shall receive certain concessions, and where Great Britain is interested on behail of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company; (c.) Mendeli to Hawizeh, in which section the basis for delimitation is necessarily vague; (d.) The Hawizeh-Mohammerah section, in which British interests are considerable, and where the Persians are called upon to accept the river bank as the frontier; 2. The above line will be delimited on the ground by the four commissioners appointed by Turkey, Persia, Great Britain, and Russia, assisted in each case by a deputy commissioner. (Arrangements have been made for the necessary technical staff to accompany each commissioner.) 3. In case of divergence of opinion, the final decision is to rest with the British and Russian commissioners. 4. Provision is made to safeguard the interests of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in any territory that may be transferred to Turkey. At the close of the year the Commission was awaiting the arrival of the Persian deputy commissioner with the members of the Persian technical staff, at Mohammerah, where they were shortly expected. III. —Poreign Indebtedness of Persia. The following loans were made to Persia during the year 1913 :— Great Britain. In April: 100,000/. for the gendarmerie in Pars; In April: 200,000/., of which 30,000/. was earmarked for the province of Pars, and 10,000/. for the construction of a new custom-house at Bushire. The loans are secured on the southern customs receipts and on the opium receipts and excise of spirits in the south, at the rate of 7 per cent, per annum. The total amount now advanced by His Majesty’s Government in 1912 and 1913 is 440,000/., repayable in half-yearly instalments of 50,000/. trom the 1st July, 1915.Russia. In April: 200,000/. All the Russian advances made to the Persian Government in 1912 have been paid off. IV. —Mohammeraji. (a.) Sheikh and Bakhtiaris. The year opened with strained relations between the Sheikh of Mohammerah. and the Bakhtiaris. The important Bakhtiari Khan, Sardar-i- Jang, was reported to be at Malamir breathing out warlike menaces at the head ol a considerable force, whilst the Sheikh was at Ahwaz, determined, it was said, to repel any hostile Bakhtiari inroad. The khans in Tehran, however, asserted that the force assembled at Malamir was intended to support the Governor of Behbehan in punitive measures directed against the Kuhgeluis. . . The cause of the dispute was the possession of certain lands known as the Jarrahi lands, which the khans acquired from Mushir-ed-Dowleh in 1912, in spite of an agreement made with the Sheikh in 1908, under which it was arranged that the Sheikh alone could purchase these lands, which are clearly in the Arab country. Such agreements are not infrequently short-lived in Persia, and the clauses of this one were systematically disregarded by the signatories almost trom the date of its conclusion.' Possibly basing himself, nevertheless, upon the fact that the BaklUians were precluded under its terms from purchasing these lands the Sheikh only offered Mushir-ed-Dowleh some 3,000/. for the lands when he proposed to sell in 1910. ihe Mushir refused the offer, but in 1912 sold them to the Bakhtiaris for 3,000/. it was at once seen that trouble would ensue from this purchase, and I received formal assurances from Jang in 1912 that he would adopt no hostile attitude towards the Sheikh, and would negotiate the sale of the Jarrahi lands to that prince. Another question in dispute between the Sheikh and the Bakhtiaris at the same time was the amount of compensation that the former should pay lor damage done to Bakhtiari property at Aqili, near Shuster, in 1912, when the Sheikh s Arabs captured that place and pillaged the villages of Aqili. As soon as I discovered that the above-mentioned formal assurances d 1 ^ 11 bv Jan' were to be disregarded, and that the situation was becoming strained by the proximitv to each other of the armed forces of the two parties, T made urgent repre sentation to the khans in Tehran, and impressed upon them that no breach of the peace must occur, and I urged them to authorise Jang to sell the lands at a reasonable price to the Sheikh. Por a long time my efforts proved unavailing in view of the difference in the monetary value placed by the two parties on the lands. It 'especia \ difficult for me'to bring an excessive amount of pressure to bear on the khans as the Bakhtiaris constituted the only armed force in the country ready to take the held, which they might have been called upon at any moment in the spring to do against Saiar-ed-l)owleh. I could not risk incurring their enmity in one direction when it was still necessarv to humour them in another. ^ i 14 .* • After some months of haggling between the Mieikh and the Bakhtiaris the latter consented to accept 30,000 tomans (say 0,000/.) for the Jarrahi lands, and 1,000/. as compensation for the damage done at Aqili. An arrangement was eitected in this sense. (b.) Sheikh and Nizam-es-Suitaneh. In June the Nizarn-es-Sultaneh expressed his great desire to return to Persia but did not dare to do so unless he had previously obtained a guarantee tor his life and property from the Persian Government, this guarantee being given through His ^ In I912°we had freed the Nizam from his debt to the Russian Bank, but as he was incurring heavy expenditure in Europe while, at the same time, y reason o is absence from Persia, getting very little income from his properties, there was some danger that he might again turn to the Russians for assistance. M ere he ,o mortgage his lands in Arabistan to the Russian Bank, it would be highly inconvenient to British interests in that province, especially to our railway enterprises. . His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire recommended that we should now gi\ e theNizam the assistance which he sought in obtaining guarantees from the Persian Government, provided that he undertook in writing— (a.) Not to sell or mortgage his landed property to anyone but the Sheikh without consulting the latter and ourselves. (b.) Not to shape his conduct in any way opposed to the interests of the Sheikh or ourselves. This latter condition was necessary, as the Sheikh was afraid that the Bakhtiaris might attempt to acquire some of the Nizam’s properties in Arabistan. The Nizam gave the necessary assurances in writing, not only on his behalf but on that of his sons also. I had in the meantime been taking the necessary steps at Tehran on behalf of the Nizam, and on the 23rd October the Minister of the Interior requested that. Prince’s brother to telegraph to him that he could return to Persia in perfect safety. The Minister of the Interior, moreover, offered him the post of Governor-General of Luristan and Burujird. It is, however, improbable that his health will allow him to take up the appointment, although he has formally accepted it. V.—Hotimuz Oxide and the Muin-ut-Tujjak. At the end of 1912 the Muin was again exploiting the Hormuz Mines, but on Government account and under the direct supervision of the Customs administration. Early in 1913 the Treasurer-General stated that Muin was regarded as the agent of the Government. His Majesty’s Government enquired whether Messrs. Weir and Ellinger’s interests were safeguarded by this arrangement, and His Majesty’s Legation replied that the only way by which it seemed that this could be done was by those two firms securing an option of a fresh contract after the expiration of Messrs. Strick’s in March 1915. In the meanwhile Messrs. Strick’s Tehran agent applied to the Persian Govern ment for a six months' extension of their contract to compensate them for the period during which their shipping were suspended in the summer of 1912. His Majesty’s Legation thereupon informed His Majesty’s Government that the sooner Messrs. W^eir and Ellinger decided whether they would apply for a subsequent contract the better, and that the Persian Government promised that they would take no action regarding Messrs. Strick’s new application until the views of His Majesty’s Government were known. In February Messrs. Ellinger informed the Foreign Office that they would make a further try to come to an agreement with Strick to share the contract in future. If they failed to accomplish this, they would apply to the Persian Government at once on their own account. His Majesty’s Government said that this course was preferable, and the Persian Government were so informed. In June the Persian Government were pressing Messrs. Strick with regard to the non-fulfilment of their contract. The Foreign Office thought that this pressure might make Messrs. Strick more disposed to come to terms with Ellinger. This Persian pressure on Messrs. Strick was really intended to pave the way for the M uin to regain his concession. The Muin was bribing the Cabinet right and left with this object. In June the plot was discovered and the Minister of the Interior spoken to very sharply on the subject. It was pointed out that Muin’s sole rights were those conferred by the Medjliss Act of 1911, which related to the island of Hormuz only, and that by this Act the Muin was virtually the Government agent for red oxide on that island alone, and that His Majesty’s Government would not consent to his regaining possession of the islands and other places mentioned in the Firman of 1901. The Minister of the Interior professed considerable ignorance on the subject, hut said that the Cabinet thought the firman was a perpetual one; a committee, he said, was examining the whole question, and the grant of a new concession was contemplated. His Majesty’s Legation thereupon informed the Muin that His Majesty’s Government considered that the Persian Government had been justified in terminating his firman, and that this termination had been officially communicated to His Majesty’s Legation at the time, and the acting-Minister for Foreign Affairs was requested, at the end of J une, to take note of the British objections and see that no final decision was taken without the knowledge of the legation. His Majesty’s Government approved the legation policy of blocking the concession until the views of the Board of Trade, the Government of India, and theAdmiralty as to the commercial and strategical aspects of the new concession were taken. In spite, however, of all assurances to the contrary the Persian Government mewed the concession, and signed a declaration stating that the duration of the concession was for fifty years from the 9th September. This action of the Cabinet was of doubtful legality, as the decision of the last Medjliss was thereby reversed. The Muin, under strong pressure from His Majesty’s Legation, then agreed to sign a document undertaking to enter into partnership with no one but British subjects in the exploitation of the concession. No such document was, however, obtained. However, as the result of vehement protest on the part of His Majesty’s Legation, the concession was nominally withdrawn on the 12th October, and His Majesty’s Government were advised that there were two courses then open : (1) to press for the complete cancellation of the concession ; (2) to make an arrangement with the Muin and get it confirmed. His Majesty’s Government preferred to adopt the first of these courses, and stated that they would take measures to endeavour to reconcile the interests of Strick and Ellinger with a view to the ultimate transfer of the concession to them. His Majesty’s Legation replied in December that it was clear that the cancel lation of the concession could only be secured by the exercise of very strong pressure such as might seriously affect British relations with Persia. A suggestion, already put forward, was renewed that, Muin being a dangerous enemy, it might be more satisfactory if some agreement were reached in conjunction with him than by trying to oust him in favour of British subjects. It was suggested that an arrangement might be made under which the islands of Henjam, Larak, and the more important part of Kishm from a naval and military standpoint, should be excluded from Muin's concession and reserved for British interests. His Majesty’s Legation thought it was especially desirable to come to terms with the Muin, as he had it in his power to make himself disagreeable by encouraging German enterprise on the Karun if thwarted elsewhere. There was a special danger of this, as the Hamburg-Amerika line had applied in October for the lease of a wharf, &amp;c., on the Karun. VI.— Telegraphs. (a.) Arabistan Convention. The protracted negotiations carried on in 1912 between the director of the Indo- European Telegraph Department and the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs reached a successful termination in January 1913 ; by this agreement the renewals of all our concessions up to 1945 was guaranteed and the construction of the Arabistan lines secured to us. Kuh-Malik-Sia h Extension. The extension of the telegraph wire from Kuh-Malik-Siah to the Perso-Baluch frontier was completed in the autumn. Ling ah-Builder Abbas Telegraph. In view of the increasing importance of the port of Lingah and in the interests of trade, His Majesty’s Government decided that an overland telegraph line ought to be constructed between that port and Bunder Abbas. The necessary representations and proposals were made to the Persian Government on the 16th October, 1913. In reply, the Persian Government has suggested tentatively that wooden standards should be used and expenses saved thereby. Kerman—Bunder Abbas Line. His Majesty’s Minister called the attention of His Majesty’s Government in November to the great need for a telegraph line from Bunder Abbas to Kerman for the use of the gendarmerie, the Customs Administration, Imperial Bank of Persia and British merchants. The director of the Indo-European Telegraph Department estimated that the cost of erection would be about 10,000/. He subsequently altered his first opinion, and put the probable cost at nearer 14,000/., or at 20,000/. if the line were carried on to Jask, an almost necessary operation if the line is to have an inter national character such as would justify us in pressing that it be constructed with iron rsfill Gstandards instead of wooden ones, a method that will probably commend itself to the Persian Government on account of its cheapness, hut would he unsatisfactory for various reasons. VII. —The Persian Sanitarv Council. (a.) The Quarantine Service in the Persian Gulf. In April, Captain McConaghey, I3I.S., was succeeded hy Major Hunt, I.M.S., as chief sanitary officer. Plague once more made its appearance at Bushire, but this year, in contra distinction to the year 1912, the outbreak was a very mild one. The first two cases occured on the 8th April on hoard the Persian steamer “ Mozaffer ” which had just arrived at Bushire from Bombay. The last case was notified in the week ending the 17th May. In all there were thirty cases with twenty-three deaths. In 1912 there were 729 deaths, in 1911 there were 98 deaths. Bushire was declared to he free of plague on the 29th May. Plague also appeared at Dobai, on the Arabian coast, in the month of March. Instances of outside interference in the affairs of the quarantine service were few. The Austrian delegate on the sanitary council at Tehran, drew up and submitted to the council a “ R£glement de Police sanitaire ” which he proposed should he applied to all the frontiers including the Persian Gulf. This document has been pigeon-holed at Tehran. It had, however, the important result of leading the Government of India to decide that “ no re-affirmation of the position of His Majesty’s Government in respect of the quarantine arrangements in the Persian Gulf is necessary.” A minor incident with an obstructive Belgian customs official also occurred. (h.) The Sanitary Council. Dr. Gachet, of the French Navy Medical Service, professor of medicine at the Royal University, has continued to act as president of the Sanitary Council. He has had a great many difficulties and personal opposition with which to contend, but he has strengthened his position during the past year, and has now better control over the business of the Council. The second French professor of medicine has left Persia; he had been a member of the Council for seven years; it is satisfactory to know that he is shortly to be replaced, for the French professors offer one of the chief obstacles to extension of German influence in the capital. The financial arrangements of the Council were the same as those in the year 1912. The usual difficulty in obtaining funds from the Treasury has been experiencd. Owing the greatly lessened expenditure on quarantine measures during the year, the Council has now a balance of about 7,000 tomans at the bank. A proposal to appoint a chief sanitary officer for the Caspian Sea and the north of Persia was made by the Council. The Russian Government, it is known, require that the holder of the post should be a Russian, and has offered to pay half his salary. Some months have passed but no appointment has been made. A Commission of the Council has examined the new Sanitary Convention of Paris, and has recommended the Persia Government to ratify it. The public vaccination service has been extended to several provincial towns. Work has been carried on at the quarantine establishments at Enzeli and Astara, and disinfecting apparatus has been supplied to them. Stations are shortly to be built at Bunder Gez and Meshed-i-Sar. (c.) Epidemics of Plague. 1. The Persian Gulf. The small outbreak at Bushire has already been described. 2. In Khorassan. Two supposed epidemics of plague in this province have to be recorded, the first of which, however, ended before the close of 1912. It is necessary to prefixthe word “supposed” in dealing with both these outbreaks, for the evidence chiefly Russian in origin in favour of their having been due to plague is somewhat dubious. 1. The first epidemic appeared at Kariz and in the neighbourhood of the Jam Rud River, near the Afghan frontier, amongst tent dwellers. It began on the 9th October, and the last case occurred on the 23rd October, 1912. As is usual in the case of outbreaks of disease among ignorant people it was impossible to obtain accurate information as to the origin, course, mortality, &amp;c., of the malady. The Russian doctor at Kariz was the first on the spot, the Russian authorities organised a Sanitary Commission at Meshed, and Russian doctors and Cossacks were hurried to the infected district. The Afghan frontier was closed as a result of vague rumours of plague at Herat. Trade, as a natural result, was greatly interfered with. At the end of the year (1912) Captain Wilson, I.M.S., medical officer to His Majesty’s consulate-general at Meshed, left with his Russian colleague for Kariz. He met the Russian Commission there, and also travelled through the district that had been affected. His opinions and conclusions are given in detail in two interesting reports which were forwarded to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs {vide despatches to the Foreign Office, No. 4, Commercial, of the 27th January, and No. 7, Commercial, of the 17th February). It may be said here that the positive evidence which Captain Wilson was able to collect in favour of the outbreak having been due to plague is extremely slender. 2. The second occasion on which plague was reported to have appeared in Khorassan was on the 26th May, and the first news was received from Russian and Belgian officials at Meshed and Kariz. The village of Faizabad. 5 kilom. from Kariz, was said to be the centre of the epidemic. It was resolved that the Sanitary Council should preserve a more expectant attitude with regard to the news than in the case of the former outbreak. Further information was asked for, the reassembly of a local Sanitary Commission at Meshed was advised, and it was urged that the English and Russian doctors should be sent at once to Kariz. Meanwhile the Russian authorities at Meshed continued to send reports of plague, the Russian consul at Turbat-i-Haidari formed a sanitary cordon with Cossacks, and the Russian Chargd &lt;TAffaires at Tehran announced that his Government was about to take the same steps as they did at the end of 1912. As a matter of fact nothing further was done. Reports ceased to arrive, no Commission was formed at Meshed, and none was sent to Kariz. By the 17th July the epidemic was declared at an end. What its exact nature was is stiil obscure. Judging from the relative inactivity of the Russian authorities as compared with the energy which they displayed in October and November 1912, even they were dubious as to the coi’rectness of the diagnosis made. Most unfortunately, owing to illness, it was not found possible to despatch the medical officer of His Majesty’s consulate-general at Meshed to Kariz. 3. In the Province of Kermanshah. In March reports of a severe epidemic at Harunabad were received from the Governor and sanitary delegate at Kermaushan. It was said to have begun in October 1912, and to be anthrax. This opinion was upheld by the doctor of the local Russian consulate (an authority on plague), who made a retrospective enquiry. However, by the neginning of June it became certain that the epidemic was none other than one of plague. The Sanitary Council at once took all possible measures. The proposition was a difficult one, for the area affected was a wide one full of villages large and small. The names of those principally affected were Harunabad, Mah-i-Dasht, and Jam Shuran. Fortunately the disease did not spread to the town of Kermanshah. The province was declared free of plague on the 10th September. The reports of the doctors sent by the Sanitary Council to the affected district will be found in the proces-verbal of the 127th meeting. VIII.— Government Gendarmerie, 1913. In spite of the fact that Lack of funds has prevented the complete realisation of the projects for the year, very considerable and satisfactory progress has been made both in numbers and organisation, extension of operations throughout the country, recruiting and popularization of the force, and actual experience in operations. At the close of 1912 the gendarmerie organisation consisted ol three regiments.The most serious losses suffered by British firms have occurred on the Kasr Shirin-Kermanshah road, and are reflected in an increase of over 6,000,000/. in the cases filed at His Majesty’s consulate at Kermanshah. The question of the failure of the Governor-General of that province, to take any action in connection with these robberies, and for the policing of the road in general, has formed the subject of separate despatches, but it is worthy of note here that at the date of the arrival of the Barman Parma at Kermanshah (April 1912), the Kermanshah claim bill amounted to seme 4,000/. only, and during his administration it has risen to 14,395/. The Bakhtiari road and the Tehran-Ispahan road have been safe throughout the year, and no robberies of any importance have occurred on either of these two important trade routes. No serious robberies either have been reported during the period under review on the Bunder Abbas-Kerman road, such new claims as have been lodged at His Majesty’s consulates at those two towns having arisen out of raids by Baharloos into the district of Shamil. The value of new claims notified to His Majesty’s consulate at Shiraz, as against 8,700/. for the preceding year, totals 2,439/., of which only some 1,000/. are on account of robberies committed on the Bushire—Shiraz road. During the year there have been three robberies of British subjects, viz.:— 1. Mr. Greene, in Bunder Abbas district, by Khamseh tribesmen, in February. 2. Mr. Anderson, at Kerdekhurd in Arag, in June. 3. Mr. James, on Hamadan-Kazvin road in July. Claims to the value of 8,142/. have been settled or cancelled during the year. This total includes the abandonment, under instructions from the Foreign Office, of the claims (4,43SZ.) on behalf of Seyyid Boozi and other Afghan camelmen at Yezd. Mr. Smart’s claim for compensation (1,000/.) has been paid in full by the treasurer- general, and a sum of 126/. was paid by Samsam-es-Sultaneh on account of the personal losses suffered by Lieut. Bullock. The claimsfor compensation for the outrage committed on this officer and for the murder of his orderly remain, however, unpaid.^ Arrangements are being made by His Majesty’s Minister, whereby the Seislan claim bill will shortly be settled practically in its entirety, and substantial reductions made in the outstandings at Shiraz.
