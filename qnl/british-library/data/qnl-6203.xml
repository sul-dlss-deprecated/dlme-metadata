Sir, I havo th .3 honour to submit, for th3 informa tion of tho Gov^rnm^nt of India, a narrativo of gvsnts in con nection with the late rising against Muscat and the action taken by this Agency in reference thereto. 2. Towards the close of January last, Shaikh Saleh bin Ali, the powerful Shaikh of the Earthi, sent his son Abdullah to join that noted freebooter, Shaikh Eamood A1 Jahafi (who has frequently figured in reports from this Agency) at Nezwah, with the ostensible object of effecting a conciliation between the oprosing factions in that town; and on the 10th February the Sultan received information that Shaikh Abdullah had brought about a truce of :; 6j months between Shaikh Bark bin Eilal, the Nezwah Chief, and his opponent Shaikh Suleiman bin Seif A1 Beyremi, and that he and Shaikh Eamqod A1 Jahafi ?/ere on their way to visit Eis Eighness in Muscat in connection with the affairs of Nezwah. For some time past Eis Eighness the Sultan, had been anxious to acquire possession of this town. When,then, he heard that Shaikhs Abdullah and Eamodd were on their way to visit him, he had hopes that matters were taking a turn favourable to his views. . „ . -o 3. The 2 Shaikh and their followers, numbering, it was supposed about 140 persons, arrived at Rui, 5 miles from Matrah, the following morning; and Shaikh Abdullah, who was accompanied by Shaikh Mohsin bin Aamir A1 Earthi, came on to Muscat with 40 of the Earthi. They were hospitably received by the Sultan, quarters were placed at their disposal, and( 2 ) th3 usual arrangemsnts made for their entertainment* The rest of their fellows were detained at Rui by the Sultan^ orders* On the morning of the 12th February, Shaikh Hamood A1 Jahafi came to Muscat with a small following and had an interview with His Highness, after which he was enertained in the quarters al lotted to Shaikh Abdullah and Mohsin, In the afternoon the Sultan sent the Shaikhs their dismissal presents, a bag of 2,000 lbs coffee,. Ealwah etc., and the party notified their intention of leaving Muscat that evening, or at the latest the following morning. After dark however, some Bedouins made their way.into the town in parties of twos and threes, and it would seem from what I subsequently heard, that the Wahabis and Haydramis, the Sultan T s most faithful guards, began to get suspicious of their visitors and gave His Highness a warning to which he paid no attention. About 4 A.M. on the 13th, Shaikh Abdullah^s party within the town rushed the gates, and let in their comrades who had come over from Rui through the Wadi. In the meanwhile, the house of Shaikh Badr bin Seif, the Sultan f s general, had been surrounded and any action on his part effectually stopped. No defence was made at either of the gates. The Sultan f s new palace was therientered through a side door (the gate keeper having been cut down) and an attack was made on the Sultan in the old palace which adjoins the new. This attack was repelled by the Sultan and the few men he had ?/ith him. His Highness shooting the first rebels who at tempted to enter. 4. The first intimation I received was at day-break, from the Customs Farmer, who, however, could give me no information as to what had occurred. I sent out to inquire, and in the meanwhile the Sultan ! s wife and her sister-in-law made their way to the Agency over the roofs of the Banians* houses, and told me of the attack on the palace and asked me to protect the Sultan. I sent their attendant back with a message offering His Highness the I I 11 I | *(3) -4 v.' i* protection of the Birtish Agency should he not be able to hold the palace, any show of force on our part in that direction being out of the question, Eis Highness shortly afterv/ards arrived, coming over the roofs of the intervening houses, and the remainder of the occupants of the palace were withdrawn in the same way. On meeting His Highness I again offered him and his family our protection, in case his position did not admit of any other resort; at that time, indeed, very little was known of the actual state of affairs beyond the main fact that the city had been taken. The Sultan thanked me for my offer, and said he did not want to seek protection at present as the forts were still in his hand. He left the Agency for Fort Julali, and his family subsequently joined him. Eis Highness was naturally much agitated and his face was bleeding from the effects of splinters struck off a wooden railing by a rebel shot. I afterwards heard that His Highness’s brother, Seyyid Mahomed bin Turki, had jumped out of his house on to the foreshore when the palace was attacked and made his way to fort Murani. The next day at Eis highness’s request I obtained a safe conduct from the rebels for the withdrawal of Seyyid Mahomed bin Turki’s family from their house to fort Julali. 5. In the meanwhile arrangements were in progress for the protection of British subjects and their property: a letter (annex A) was written to Shaikh Abdullah whom I took to be the rebel leader warning him that he would be held directly responsible for the loss to our subjects in life and property. Eis reply (annex B) intimated that he would restrain his followers from doing damage, that the rising was general their Hinawi movement, and that^object was to dethrone the Sultan, (annexB). The escort was called into the Agency building, notices of nationality were issued to British subjects to affix to the(4) doors of thoir housos and godowns, and all precautions were taken which are usual on occasions of disturbance* Owing to the sud denness with which events had declared themselves, it was impos sible to remove British property to a place of safety, neither boats nor porterage being available* The Hindoo merchants brought some of their treasures and valuables to the Agency for safe cus tody, but the majority shut themselves up in their houses af.ter affixin^he notice to their doors. At Matrah, the Khojas withdrew to their fort which was supplied with a British Blag, and British subjects of the Banian community were advised to shut up their houses, affix the notices supplied, and take to the shipping in the roacstead, in view of the expected advance of Shaikh Saleh with the object of occupying that town* 6. Shortly after the Sultan had entered fort Julali, a can nonade and rifle fire was commenced from both forts on to the old Palace, a rush at which was made along the beach by about 30 men of the Sultan f s adherents who had begun to arrive in boats from Matrah and Sidabh; this rush was repelled by a volley from the window of the Palace and the party ran back to fort Murani with a loss of 6 of their number. Another attempt was made to occupy Seyyid Fahad ! s house adjoining the old palace and the Customs house; this and the old palace were actually held for above an hour after which the Sultan f s men withdrew to fort Julali. It was unfortunate for the Sultan that this position was not permanently occupied for it would have formed a strong basis from which to attempt the recapture of the new palace later on* As it was, both houses fell into the rebels* hands, and auickly strengthened their defensive position when an advance was made by the Sultan*s reinforcements. 0. The position on the evening of the 13th stood thus; the Sultan and his brother occupied the two forts overlooking the harbour \ Aall tli3 outside towers and one tower on the city walls on the south east side of the town were held by his men, whilst the rebels occupied the town itself. Their number was thought for some da 3 r s to be only 150, but I have since received au thentic information that when the coup was made there were between 250 and 300 of them. They did not molest any of the inhabitants, and were well under the control of their leaders who said they had. come to rule not to rob. They assumed a quiet defensive position in the town, awaiting further reinforcements. About I received a verbal message from the rebels inti mating that Shaikh Saleh, would arrive with a large force that evening or the following morning to occupy Matrah, and sug- » gesting that British subjects should be warned to look after their property, l sent the Agency Munshi to Shaikh Abdullah warning him again that he would be held responsible for all damage done to our subjects, both here and at Matrah, and desiring that this warning be communicated at once to the advancing party, which Shaikh Abdullah said he would do. The Agency Munshi repeated to me that he had seen all three leaders who were unanimous in declaring that the people of Oman were tired of Seyyid Ppisal f s rule, and they were deter mined to have a Sultan who would rule the country. Shaikh Abdullah and Mohsin said they would act as to who had the power (referring to Shaikh Saleh) might direct, whilst Shaikh Eamood intimated that no one would content him but Eis Eigh- ness Abdul Aziz, 7. The down mail arrived at 7 A,M, on the 14th February Mr A, Mackirdy, the Agent of the B.I.S.N.Co., at once placed her at my disposal, and I despatched the vessel to Ohabar (Annex C,) with my telegram to your address. No one was al lowed to land, and of course all trade was at a standstill.Boforo the departure of the mail steamer, the Vazier came to me with a message from the Sultan asking if I would send the vessel to Soor to bring up reinforcements for His Highness. I regret ted that for several reasons I was unable to complv with this request. Apart from other considerations, the fact that the persons and property of our subjects were in the hands of the rebels would alone have been sufficient to make the policy of strict nutrality, which I adopted from the first, one of absolute necessity. The rebels employed their time during the day in wrecking the Sultan ! s palaces, and auctioning all his fxir- niture and effects which they had not destroyed. Several pieces of furniture and other articles were bought in by Baians to return to His Highness. An order was issued forbidding British subjects from having any-dealings with the rebels in this con nection on their own account. (annex D) A letter was received from Shaikh Abdullah suggesting a communication of interests between himself and me, and intimating his readiness to abide b^* v/hat I though advisable in the in terests of all. (annex E) To this I replied that what I require of him in the present state of affairs in Muscat, was the ef fectual protection of our subjects and their property from his followers. 8. Early in the morning of the 15th the white Mutawwah flag was seen flying from the palace flag-staff, which seemed to indicate that the rebels were acting in the interests of the Rostuk branch of the reigning family. I paid the Sultan a visit in fort Julali, and was glad to find His Highness in fairly good spirits; he was expecting the arrival of reinforcements on the morrow and seemed confident of outing the rebels from the town. (annex P.&amp; G.) Here reference to the question of the occupation by the rebels of the extreme eastern portion of the town, with a view to cutting off the Sultan^ communication with the land(7) on that sids, I had pr3viously recoivod a verbal communica tion from Shaikh Abdullah informing mo of what ho proposed to do and asking if I had any objection* To this I replied through the Agency Munshi that I could not consent to their drawing the fire of the fort down on this quarter of the town which was almost exclusively occupied by British subjects and the Foreign Consuls. After the receipt of my letter (G), the rebels drew back from our immediate vicinity. . 9• The first reinforcements for the Sultan arrived on th the 17th the Beni Jabir from Tao. Shortly after the arrival, I received a letter(annex E) from the rebel leader informing me that he had been joined by 400 men, and subsequent information brought me from the town was that the number of the rebels had been materially in creased, I received a visit from Shaikh Mohsin bin Amr who told me the rising was a general Einawi movement with the object of de throning the Sultan; on other points he was very reticent as to who had prompted the rising; and who their Nominee for the Sultan would be in the event of their success, he would say nothing. I gathered from him that Shaikh Saleh was close to Matrah with a numerous following. As he was not the principal leader, I deemed it advisable to confine, the rest of our conversation to the immediate object of his visit, which was the occupation of the extreme eastern portion of the town; on this point I declined to go beyond what I had said to Shaikh Abdullah in my letter of the 16th February (c). Throughout the interview 7 , the Shaikh w r as profuse in his pro testations that the tries of Oman desired nothing but the friendship and support of the British Government. Further reinforcements came in for the Sultan during the day.10. Thg afternoon of the 17th February the Vazier came to me with a message from the Sultan, about which I thought it desirable to go and see His Highness personally. His Highness wished to know whether I could mediate between him and the rebels, and get them to leave the town before damage was done property, and who would be responsible for damage done if he decended from the fort and tried to recover the town. To His Highness T s first query I replied that I should be happy to afford my good offices when the proper time for mediation should arrive, but that I doubted whether the opening of negociation on the lines indicated by His Highness would serve any useful purpose in the present state of affairs, as the rebels had as yet received no check and they had* clearly intimated that their object in seizing Muscat was to obtain the Government. On the Sultan assuring me that he intended to fight and drive the rebels out, I pointed out to him that an 3 r overtures might very likely be interpreted by the rebels as a sign weakness on his part. In offering my good offices with a view to mediation should an opportunity occur, I was aware that I should have to be careful to in no way compromise Government with any guarantee to either side r In reply to the Sultan T s second question, I satd that only a general answer could now be given, the Government of a country was responsible for the safety of property in its town; I added that when the rebels first appeared I warned them that they would be held responsible for all damage occurring from their acts, but now they had held possession of the town for 5 days without any destruction to property, and the situation had some what changed. 11. Late the same evening, I received a message from Shaikh Abdullah to the effect that Seyvid Saood bin Azzan had arrived and had assumed the functions of leader, and that Shaikh Saleh was now at hand with a large force, and would accupy Matrah that night(9) A warning was s^nt to British subjects in Matrah threats of occupying this town were frequently made by the rebels after this, but as a matter of fact no demonstration was made against Matrah which is of secondary importance to Muscat. The taking of Matrah would have been the first steps to the invesment.'of the Forts, as the sultans supplies would have thus been cut off; and this the rebels would have done, had had they received sufficient reinforcements to press the a t uack. 12. Early on Monday the 18th an atteiant was made by the sultan to recover possession of the town, the point of attack being the Babh Saghir. For several hours there was fighting in the Banians f quarters; the attack on the Babh Saghir finals ly failed with a loss to the Sultan of 20 men. The number of rebels killed and wounded was never ascertained, but it was said to be considerably in excess of the loss of the Sultan*s side. This fighting was a serious danger to our subjects, for not only was it carried on; in the streets,round their houses, but to both sides mounted on the roofs and entered the rooms of the Banians* houses and fought from house to house. It was time to take immediate steps for the protection of our people, and this I was enabled to do through the opportune arrival of E.MS. 'Sphinx**. A short truce was insisted upon. There was but little time in which to arrange details, and as I found the representa- tines inclined to agree about terms and show a disposition to refer for orders, an Arabic letter was placed in their hands calling upon each side to suspend hostilities from midday to two hours after sunset. The object of the truce was explained to them, and they were told that this was an authoritative order and that I should commence to remove British subjects from Muscat in half anhour without waiting for rsplios, I subsequently received an intimation from the Sultan and the rebel chief that my wishes had been met and acted * on. In the meanwhile boats and barges were collected and brought to the Agency foreshore by K,M. S. Sphinx’s steem launch, and in the course of the afternoon all British subjects were removed from Muscat to safe quarters at Mukellah, where they remained in safety till the conclusion of the disturbances, I should not have been able to take this very necessary stop had not E.M6. Sphinx been here, for it would have been impossible to collect boats, also the presence of a man-of-war in harbour added weight to my demand for a temporary cessation of hostilities, I would wish to bring to the notice of Government the service rendered by Captain J,Felly, Senior Naval Officer P,G,Division, on the occasion, and my hearty acknowledgement of the ready and courteous assistance he offered me in this very important matter. To the exertions of Surgeon Lt-Col,, A,S,Jayakar it is due that all our subjects were got out in time. He went about from house to house in the rebels’ quarters, and got out those who through fear or for other reasons were unwilling to leave their walls, and he subsequently exerted himself to obtain for our people such comfort as was possible at Mukellah, Complaints were frequently received during the afternoon, of breaches of the truce on both sides, the Sultan’s men being the chief of fenders; on the whole it was finally well kept, and no accident occurred to any our people. The small Europen community was accommodated on board E,M,S, Sphinx, and at the Agency where quarters were also found for the Agency hospital staff, 13. At 2.P,M. on the 18th February, you arrived in R,I,M,S. Lawrence; I proceeded on board and informed you how matters stood and you then assumed the general direction of affairs^ Of w'hat subsequently occurred you are fully aware and you have( 11 ) r'sportsd to Govormnsrit, on tho position from tim 3 to timo by wiro and lottor. It will, howsvor, bo oonveniont to com- ploto this narrative with a short rosumo of the soquonce of events, from the time of your arrival to the close of the dis turbances. 14. For the next two days but little vas done on either side, a desultory cannon and musketry fire being kept up by the Sultan*3 men increasing about sunset. The Sultan received considerable reinforcements, but the failure of Monday f s attack seemed to have damped the spirits of his followers. On the 21st, slight advance, supported by fire from the forts, was made by the Sultan T s side, as far as the eastern gates of the Customs House, the rebels falling back slightly in the centre to concentrate their position. Communication with that part of the town occupied by the rebels was now quite cut off, and information as to their numbers and movements was henceforv/ard most difficult to obtain, 15. The afternoon of the 22nd, a sepoy of the Marine Battalion, who was on sentry duty over a door on the western side of the Agency, was unfortunately struck by a stray bullet, coming from the rebels* direction. It was at first feared a that the wound would be mortal onej subseauently it was as certained that the ball had escaped the lungs. The patient rallied and in a few days was pronounced out of danger. Care had been taken to place the sentries so as to avoid risk as far as possible, but there was not complete immunity from stray shots at any time in the Agency precincts. After the accident all natives were withdrawn inside the build-r ings, and folltowes were warned to be careful not to expose themselves, a caution which had boon previously given. Complaints were received this day from the Banians that theirgodowns had boon looted by tho Sultan^ allies, chiefly the Beni Boo Ali* The Yazier was desired to meet the Resident and myself at the Agency and' the chief Shaikhswere also sent for* Subsequently His Highness arrived. What was first said to the Vazier was after wards repeated to the Shaikhs, and thus in effect to the Sultan himself -that while friends of the Sultan, and enemies of none in Oman, but friendly to all its people, and in no way objecting to the presence of the Shaikhs and their followers to aid their ruler, we imperatively objected to the looting of British subjects - The Shaikhs were strongly warned to restrain their followers from \ acts of violence, and it was forcibly pointed outto them that their boats were entirely at the mercy of our armed force onthe sea, and that if British property was plvmdered by their followers it was in our power at once to seize and destroy their boats and that the doing of this might become necessary; t,hey seemed to under stand this and were dismissea,'in order to make the necessary com munication to their followers. The Sultan could give no idea of his plans or of his prospects of success; indeed on these points he has been singularly uncom municative throughout. 16. Seyyid Eamood bin Azzan arrived at Rui on the 23rd Feb ruary with 50 men* The first complaint was now received of looting on the rebels T side, and I addressed a letter (annex i ) to Seyyid Saooa warning him that if proceod.ings of this kind were not put a stop to, it might become necessary for us to take action. In his reply (annex J) Seyyid Saood attempted to excuse the entry of his followers into the Banian) temple, on the ground that the Sultan T s troops had commenced firing from the tops of the houses and practically denied that any plunder had been done. When I saw the temple later on, it was wrecked from top to bottom but it then in possession of the Sultan’s men and it is probable that they completed what the rebels had commenced.(13) •ifo) lAnnax K) is an accompaniment to Seyyid Saood's letter (J). 17. On ths 24tli February it was r^portsd that 300 to 400 of tho Yal Wahaboh had joinod Shaikh Saleh at Rui, and that this Shaikh had declared a general war against all Ghafiris in the Sharkiyeh and Jalan, on account of the assistance they had rendered to the Sultan. A long petition was received from the Banian community, set ting forth the hardships and loss of property to which they asking were exposed by the presence of the rebels, that if the fight could not be stopped, a,i least a cessation of hostili ties be effected for the purpose of enabling them to remove their more portable valuables. I had an interview with the Vazier '■ v ^ 10 waS told that we had been expecting some attempt on His Highnessts part to recover possession of the town, but that not',withstanding the fact that he had received all the reinforcements he expected, nothing had yet been done, and it was added that wo had a right to ask how long this present position was to be allowed to continue. The Vazier replied that the Sultan was continually urging the Shaikhs to advance but without success, and he informed me that a council of war was being held and that he honed some-' thing would soon be done. 18. The following day, the 25th Februay, the Sultanas forces took the water gate and the lower half way between it and the Babh Kabir, and on the left the Beni Boo Ali advanced their barricade some 50 yards. On the 26th the position appearing as hopeless as ever, you sent for the Vazier and some of His Highnesses Councillors to enquire how matters stood, what hopes and plans the Sultan had and what prospect he could hold out of order being restored. The conversation that then took place was recorded in the form of a memorandum.(14) &gt; But little information was afforded by Eis Highnoss ? s represen tatives: they said that the Sultan was continually urging his forces to make a determined move; that reinforcements were being sent round to the water gate in view' of a combined attack on bpth sides of the town, and they trusted some definite result would soon be attained* s , They were dismissed with a message to the Sultan, to the effect uhat it would be a matter of great regret to you if you were com pelled to report by the next mail, that aftor more than a fortnight of this state of things nothing practically been done, notwith standing that large resources were available to end the deplorable position now existing, and that it was certain the news would be received by Government with grave concern. The time had now come to demand a clear exposition of what we are to expect. It was added, that though not .desiring to interfere with the Sulian's opera tions, it would be necessary, failing a definite assurance of some thing being achieved to restore order, for us to insist on a truce for some days to afford opportunity for securing the property of our people, Eis Highness T s answer being fairly satisfactory you at once wrote him a letter (annex L) to which he replied the following morning (annex M), Some days afterwards at an interview I had with Eis Highness he expressed his deep regret at not replying at once in the sense desired by the Resident, the reason being, he told me, that he was dreadfully worried and had in fact nothing to communicate; he complained bitterly of his allies, especially the Beni Boo &amp;li, asked me why they would not fight and said they had simply come to sponge on him. There can be no doubt that the Sultan*s situation was an extremely difficult one, A letter (annex L &amp; A) was this day received from Shaikh Saleh, reiterating the reasons and objects of the rebellion. 19- cJayakar ! s boat was fired on this faternoon by one of the rebels from a hill between Matrah and Muscat, My correspondence(15) with Soyyid Saood bin Azzan in this connection is contained in annexes N.O.L.P, I am not inclined to attach much im portance to the incident, as Jakayar was satisfied that it was the act of a man who evidently did not recognise our flag* Accidents of this kind, though, must not be allowed to occur, and this was impressed on the rebel leader and an explanation demanded. 20. A slight advance was made by the Sultan T s forces in the centre who captured the Banians 1 temple from the rebels - the Sultan^ position was then east of a line drawn from the eastern gate of the Customs House past the temple to the big Musjid. Beyond this no advance was subsequently made. The rebels held the rest of the town with the exception of the space intervening between the two barricades. 21. On the first March an unfortunate accident occurred. I had occasion to send Peon Othman with a letter to the rebel chief, which he carried under cover of a British Flag, firing having first been stopped at and near the Sultan^ barricade, from which he passed by one of His Highness T s official stati ed there for the purpose. He delivered the letter and received a reply, but on his return he accompanied a Banian T s servant to the house of his master, and going upstairs was unfortunately shot through the head by a stray bullet. This servant had been allov/ed to proceed to the rebel chief to get a safe conduct to the house which the rebels had reported as having been damaged by the Sultan»s artillery some days beforet The room in which the peon fell was on the upper storey, and no one could be seen in the room for the window shutters were all closed; the accident was done by chance firing by the Sultan*s men at the houses in the rebels 1 lines. There had been but little firing this day and no particular danger was anticipated after passing between the barricades, and the unfortunate peon had not been instructed to proceedto this hons^ but merely to make over the servant to Seyyid Saood bin Azzan, 22, I had a long interview with the Vazier on the morning of the following day, the purport of which I recorded in form of a memo. We discussed the situation and the prospects of order being restored. The Vazier told me the Sultan was much troubled at the want of activity displayed by his allies, who, he was sure had not come here with his interests at heart, but on account of the old tribal enemity between the Kinawis and Ghafiris, That was the Vazier ! s firm belief, that the tribesmen did not intend to make a determined assault on the rebels, and that their object was to prolong matters, i He also told me, not on behalf of the Sultan, that Saeed bin Ali one of the Karthi Shaikhs who had always been friendly to the negociations Sultan was busy trying to set^on foot, and the Vazier thought the rebels were in a fix and would be willing to come to terms, more especially as the ^eni Boo Ali Shaikh had written to the Naim and the Ghafiri tribes of the Dhahereh to come and aid the Sultan. In the afternoon further complaints of looting were made by the Banians, and it now became necessary to demand a cessation of hostilities for the purpose of enabling them to remove their more valuable property from the town. You recorded a note the purport of which I communicated to the Sultan in person, which was to the effect that nothing had been done to restore order and security, that meanwhile^nxiety, for the safety of British property was increasing and constant reports of plundering were being made, that the position had become intolerable and that there was no other course but to require the Sultanas consent to a 3 days truce to allow of the removal, as far as possible, of valuable property and to demand Ik' to Eis Highness. It was evening when I communicated this message to the Sultan who readily gave his consent to the truce. A letter (annex P.1,) was sent to Shaikh Saleh demanding a truce.(17) and desiring ths attendance of two of his Shaikhs at the Agency the following day. Reports were received of the loot ing of rice from godowns of British subjects by the Beni Boo Ali, which it was reported they had smuggled away in their boats at night. Shaikh Abdullah bin Salim and another Shaikh of this tribe were sent for to the Agency. They denied that their people had done any looting, saying that there were many tribes in this portion of the town. Shaikh Abdullah admitted having sent some bags of rice off during the night, which he said the Sultan had given him as rations for himself and followers. Actual proofs against this tribe not being then forthcoming, and his presence being required with his men to stop their firing, so as to enable the rebels ! representatives to reach us, he was dismissed with a summary warning. At night Shaikh Rashid bin Azaiz, one of the Sultanas leading officials, placed a guard at the Mughub to stop any suspicious bags being removed. 23. The Resident and myself then had an interview with the rebels 1 representatives. Shaikh Mohsin bin Aamir and : , L another Shaikh of the Earth. Asked why they had acted as they had done, they said they wished for a ruler on whom all would be agreed. On its being pointed out to them that all the Einawis were not with them, they replied that they were; although all the tribes had not yet appeared in Strength, they were coming and all had repre sentatives with them. own As regards Zanzibar, they said they had acted on their^behalf and not on behalf of the Sultan of Zanzibar. Withe regard to the complaints of looting, they said they said had they^done all in their power to stop it and restrain their followers over whom they admitted they now had not full con trol. They admitted their responsibility for any damagedone, which they said they would make good. Asked how, they replied that Shaikh Saleh had wealth and would give full com pensation. With regard to their objects, they said they wished to offer the Sultanate to the Sultan of Zanzibar, and failing him to one of the sons of Seyyid Azzan bin Kais. They were anxious that their objects as above, should be reported to Government by wire, and were told in reply that so far from their wishes representing the general opinion of the country, there was no evidence to show that it was the general wish of the Hinawis, as their numbers were small and the Ghafiris out numbered them 4 to 1. They said that the wish of Shaikh Saleh was the wish of the Hinawis. They were told that a small number of them had attacked Seyyid Feisal (whdjfor years had been the friend of Government) and had thrown the place into confusion and disorder causing injuiyand damage to British Property, and that this was a most serious matter asd would be regarded as such by Government. To this they said that Seyyid Feisal was not a friend of Government, and that they had chosen Seyyid Eamwood bin Thoweyni because they knew he was , Asked how it could be presumed Seyyid Feisal was not a friend of Government, they would only say that the fact was clear as the day. 24. _ The V a zier and Shaikh Rashid bin Azaiz were then summoned and the terms of the treaty were arranged, the principal of v/hich were;- (a) That the truce should last till 2 hours after sunset on the 6th instant. (b) That during this period no firing or fight be allowed in the town by either side. (c) Every facility was to be afforded to British subjects to remove their property, and to ensure their safety for which purpose both sides withdraw bedouins'and others, on whom they could not place confidence, from the precincts of the Bazaars, and proper guards be placed(19) under responsible Shaikhs. (d) No advance of any kind was to be made by either side t during the period of the truce. 25. The next morning early, I went round the barricades of each side and got the leaders to withdraw their followers from the tops of the houses so as to prevent as far as pos sible any loose firing and breaking of the tru-s; I saw to the opening of the Customs house gates which each side was too suspicious of the other to open, British subjects were then allowed to enter the town, and the work of removing the more valuable portions of their possessions commenced. This work went on fairly smoothly for the first dayy though complaints were received of obstruc ^ion by the bedouins, which were at once referred to the leaders. On the 2nd day the tension became more acute; frequent com plaints were received of obstruction and intimidation coupled with blackmail by the bedouins over whom it was evident the leaders were loosing control. A letter (annex W) was written to Shaikh Saleh, warning him of the serious consequences of any interference with our people. In his reply (annex X) he denied that British sub jects had been interfered with, but admitted that he and his followers had fallen short of their duty to us, and asked for pardon. Early on the 3rd day a panic set in, and all British subjects left the town and retired back to Mukellah. The only cause that cuuld be discovered for this panic was a shot fired from the roof of one of the palaces; but doubtless the temper of 1 the bedouins the previous day^predisposedthe Banians to take fright, and the firing after dusk in the town during the period of the truce (v/hich though contrary to the terms agreed on by both sides, could not be stopped) had further tended to diminish confidence*/ i ( 20 ) Tha pr9caution had. b33n taken before the truce commenced, of warning British subjects not to remain in the town during the night, 26. The Vazier was asked to convey a message to the Sultan, asking if His Highness would agree to prolong the period of the truce; but this His Highness absolutely declined to do, saying he had received further reinforcements, more were on there way, and he hoped soon to be able to make a resolute attack on the rebels» position. In reply, the Vazier was told that it rested with His Highness to incur the further responsibility if such there should be of declining another dayts truce to remove British property still remaining in the town. 27. Shaikh Mohsin bin Aam'r and another rebel Shaikh were then summoned to the Agency. On being asked about violence and threats to our subjects, and prevention in the removal of property, they gave vague and evasive answers to this and many questions. They admitted that they had ignorant with them, whose cupidity was excited at seeing property being taken out of the houses, and that all their followers were not now in hand; they said that all the leaders had been busily engaged in helping our subjects and in restraining their own followers, and that any British subject who was sent to them was furnished with men to help him in the removal of his property. They fully admitted their liability for all damage done, adding that the arm of Govern ment was long, and that their property and trade was open to the sea. To this they were told, that their property and trade would cer tainly be held liable, but their acceptance of responsibility^ was not sufficient, and that we could not admit for a moment that they could come and do mischief on the pretext of compen sation from their trade. Having been sternly warned, about mistaking our moderation, that responsibility would be strongly enforced, and that by( 21 ) injuring British propsrty th3y wars in opposition to Govsrn- mant, thsy wsre told to convsy the tenour of the above remarks to Shaikh Saleh. The Shaikh intimated that the rebels would leave the town if tcld by us to do so, but afterwards said that this was only were meant as polite form of speech; that they ready however to go if a show of force were used. 28. By this time the day was far advanced, and it would have been futile to attempt any further removal of property from the town, and perhaps with the experience of yesterday before us, this would not have been altogether advisable had we had time. However, it was hoped that the more valuable and portable property belonging to our people had been safely removed, and that what remained was mostly rice,dates, etc., in bulk, for which no place of storage either at Mukellah or on boats was available, and inquiries which were made showed this to be mainly the case. 29. At 4 P.M. on the 7th instant having arranged for a short cessation of hostilities, I proceeded to the Customs house in one of H.M.3.Sphinx 1 s boat, and personally communi cated to Shaikh Saleh the orders of Government, to the effect that (a) any union between Muscat and Zanzibar was now im possible (b) that British property was to be respected, or else we should have to take active measures to protect it. I added on behlaf of the Resident|that the position contem plated in (b) had practically arisen from their recent acts in looting, and impeding the removal of British propertj'. Shaikh Saleh did not deny that damage had been done by his followers, and laid stress on the fact that damage also had been done by the Sultan»s people. To this I remarked, that I had met him with reference to matters on his side, and not with regard to the short comings of the Sultanas followers. Shaikh Saleh then admitted his full responsibility for alldamags by his psopls, promised full compensation, and asked with reference to property belonging to our subjects still left in the town, that it might be'-all removed to a place of safety. With regard to the question of damage and compensation, I replied, as directed by you in anticipation of Shaikh Saleh*8 making some such admissions, that he was not a ruler and tha,t the Government was not in his hands, and therefore, although his responsibility for damage done by his followers was unquestionable, his mere accep tance of responsibility and promise of compensation would not be accepted as sufficient. As regards the further removal of British property, I said that this was impossible for two reasons: 1st, that our subjects had neither boats in which to remove, nor places in which to store further property; 2nd, that the actions of his followers on the 2nd and 3rd days of the truce had made it impossible' for us to allow our subjects, with due regard to their safety and the actual removal of property, to again venture amongst his tribesmen. Understanding that Shaikh Saleh had nothing further to say in connection with the object of my mission, I repeated to him the orders of Government to insure his thoroughly understanding them, and then terminated the interview. There is reason to believe that the communication of these orders had a very material effect in bringing on the peace which was concluded two days faterwardS, for it was known that latterly Shaikh Saleh had considerable difficulty in keeping back a portion of his followers who, tired of the protracted v/ar, were anxious to return to their homes, and that he had only kept them together by locking -the gates and spreading false reports about the early arrival of aid in ships and money from Zanzibar* The interview with Shaikh Saleh was held in a narrow street, surrounded by his leaders and tribesmen, and I took care that what I had to say to the Shaikh was heard by those a,bout him. 30. In the afternoon, an official of His Highness, came to(23) board the R.I.M.S* Lawr3ncs with Isttsrs from ths Sultan, ask ing for our active assistance in repelling the rebels. You replied to His Highness the following morning, to the effect that the troubles which had befallen him had caused you much concern but that you regretted that you were not authorised to intenvene in such an internal contest as now unhappily prevails and that therefore you were unable to take the action which His Highness sought - you added that you would be rejoic ed to hear that these troubles had come to an end (annex Q&amp;R). I also annex copies of my correspondence with the Sultan in this connection (S&amp;t). It will be observed that in his letter of the 4th March the Sultan made an allusion to assistance from us, which could not be taken as a direct request for aid. 31. On the 8th, it was reported that another British godown had been broken into by the Sultan*s allies. Shaikh Rashid bin Uzaiz was sent for, and a search instituted which produced a few bales of rice and wheat. Shaikh Rashid was then sent with a message to the Sultan to have a strong party of 20 to 30 men, on whom he aould depend, placed at night near the Musjid by the Agency, to stop any property being removed from the town; the necessity for a step of this kind had been brought to the Sultan ! s notice after the first complaints of looting by his people had been received and it had been subsequently repeated. Shaikh Rashid was further desired to inform the Sultan that if he could not stop this pilfering and removal of goods, we should have to do so ourselves, which might be prejudicial to His Highness’s interests in this state of affairs. 32. Since the truce, there had been an almost complete cessation of firing in the town, which was taken to indicate that more negociations were in progress. On the morning of the 9th, intimation was received that this was actually thecaso, and at 5 P.M* an official cams on board Sphinx, with a msssags from His Highnsss to say that psacs was being made and that he trusted it would be concluded that night; His Highness added that he had delayed giving us this intimation in the hopes of being able to tell us that the war was over, but as his represen tatives had not yet returned he could not wait any longer without communicating to us the news. Two hours later the same official came to the Agency on behlaf of the Sultan to say that the terms of the peace had been settled and that the rebels would leave during the night. His Highness wished British subjects to retun to their homes and shops as soon as it was known that the rebels had left the gates, but this could not be permitted. A message was sent to the Sultan that British subjects would be allowed to retun in the morning as soon as it was ascertained that all was safe and His Highness was urged to keep his allies within their present position and not allow them to advance further into the town until His Highness had come down from the fort, and British subjects were back in their homes and shops. The official assured us that orders to this effect had been issued; we said it was a wise precaution and trusted the orders would be carried out. 33. Early the next morning the scene in the town was one of ruin and desolation. In every direction, shops godov/ns and houses had been broken open and their contents either pillaged or des troyed; the streets were strewn with grain, torn account books, % and broken articles from the houses. On their departure, the rebels must have looted all thev could, and in a spirit of wanton destruction broken everything they could not carry away. To add to the destruction, the town was on fire in 4 places; and the Sultan f s allies, who had overrun the town as soon as the rebels left, joined the Baloochis and lower classes in pilfering from the open shops what there was still left to take. Some of His Highness f s retainers were attempting to restore order, and parties(25) werg employed in getting tho fires under control and prevent ing their spread, by pulling down the surrounding buildings* After ascertaining the state the town was in, I proceeded to the fort and besought His Highness to come down, and by his presence stimulate the efforts of his officials to restore order and save what property was still left in the town* A little later His Highness and his brother Seyyid Mahomed bin Turk! descended from the fort, and we afterwards found them superintending operations at the fires* Seyyid Mahomed bin Turki was most energetic; both the Agency fire engines had been placed at his disposal, and he was constantly on the scene till the fire in the big bazaar, the most obstinate of all, w r as finally extinguished on the 3rd day. Fortunately, the fire did not reach the more inflammable khojas dry goods merchants, and fears of a general conflagra tion soon subsided. engaged in setting their shops and houses to rights, but the presence of His Highness ! s allies|/;as a constant source of anxiety and even of some danger, consequently our people re turned to Mukellah at night and did not for some days resume their usual w r ork in the town, nor were they able for the same reason to bring back their property, which had been removed during the truce, till the 7th instant. Several representations were made to the Sultan, urging him to dismiss his allies as soon as he possibly could, but this necessarily took time, the claims of all the tribes had to be pled, and there was difficulty in obtaining boats for those w r ho had to return by sea. In view of these considerations, and of the fact that this A portion of the town which is occupied by the shops of the 34. In the next few days British subjects were busily was not a time to consider our claims against the Sultan ortak^ any action which would further add to his difficulties, you authorised me to continue the payment of the subsidy as usual. His Highness T s cheque was presented on the 13th and the payment thus made was of considerable service to him in his straitened circumstances, and helped to disembarass him of a portion of his supports. The Beni Jalir and the people of Nakl were only sent to Matrah, but the difficulty of boats delayed the departure of the Jaalan reinforcements; the majority of these departed bythe 18th instant, and it is now thought there are but 200 to 300 left, a portion of whom may be retained for the strengthening of the garrison till other arrangements are made; the gates being in the hands of the Wahabis and Hydramis, the Sultan ! s best men, 35. On the 13th instant the French Cruiser u Troude n arrived from Obok. Yesterday, reports were received that Kurriyat had been looted by ' a kindred spirit to Shaikh Hamwood el Jahati. There are only 10 British subjects in the place; they estimated their loss at about 1000 dollars. After leaving Muscat, Shaikh Saleh and his forces halted for a day at Rui,^where he dismissed the tribes who had espoused his caus h-e then proceeded on his way to Sammed (with his more immediate followers) where he is now said to be. P. 36. The number of killed and wounded during these 3-§- weeks of civil war has not been correctly ascertained. The Sultan must have lost about 40 men killed, and 60 wounded. It is thought that the rebels 1 loss is 80 killed, and they are said to have car ried away with them 80 wounded when they left the town. This would give a total loss in killed and wounded of 260, probably an outside estimate. With regard to the rebels* loss, it must be remembered that the Sultants troops used their ammunition freely, day and night, for nearly 3 weeks* the rebels had but little and ^ -Itr rf a jEi in' tmm'- war® careful of it, but their was the more effective.Altogsthsr, bstwsen 500 and 600 rounds must havs baon firsd from ths guns of the forts. Ons interesting fact is, that the time of each discharge from fort Julali, which is almost immediately above the Agency Building, was accurately recorded by the Anemometer supplied by the Meteorological Department. Reports were constantly current for several days, at the early part of the war, that Shaikh Hamwood el Jalufi had been mortal-*- ly wounded and had succumbed. Perhaps unfortunately for the future peace of Oman, these rumours proved to be unfounded. 37. The attitude of the rebel chiefs towards us was satisfactory throughout. They came as they said to rule and not to loot, and their acts were in accordance with their words. In the first few days of the disturbance, when the town was wholly in their hands, not a complaint of robbery or theft was received, and their arrangement for the protection of life and property left nothing to be desired. In my dealing with them I found them anxious to meet all my wishes, and on more than one occasion they assured me that the tribes of Oman desired nothing but the friendship and sup port of the British Government, It was not till the eleventh day of the occupation that any robbery took place on their side, and thenceforward it was apparent that the tribesmen were becoming impatient at the protraction of hostilities and getting more and more out of hand. Later on the tension increased, and finally ended in general pillage and destruction. In this the leaders are of course directly responsible, and this responsibility they had admitted, though it was not accepted by us as sufficient. That the chiefs were unable to control their followers is no excuse whatever for the violation by the tribesmen of British property a fact which our interest will require us to demonstrate to the offending tribes in a forcible manner. The Sultan has abstained from giving us any information as to(28) thg t3rms which ths rebels exacted from him as the price of their withdrawal - they are believed to be; (a) The payment of a cash sum variously estimated at from 12,000 to 17,000 dollars. (b) The continuation to the leaders and the Rustak family of the allowances they formerly enjoyed. (c) Forgiveness for past acts. It is possible His Highness may have felt some natural distaste in alluding to such unfavourable conditions. 38. The above is a narration of events connected with the rebellion, on the political situation. On the question of com pensation to our subjects for loss of property, and other matters incidental to the rising, I shall shortly address you separate com munications. With regard to damage to British property T may now say, that from all I can gather, and making allowance for reports which may have been exaggerated, the total loss may perhaps be put down at one lac of dollars; but this estimate cannot be regarded as conclusive, and I doubt if our subjects are yet aware of the exact amount of their losses. Trade is now beginning to resume its wonted course, and a certain amount of confidence has been restored. 39. It would be difficult even in the pre-Ismalite days of ignorance, to find a parallel for the dastardly act of treachery which has been perpetrated by Shaikh Saleh and his subordinates on their Sultan. The three Shaikhs mentioned at the beginning of the narrative, were on a visit to Seyyid Feisal; they were hospitably received by him and were dismissed with presents, which, considering the Sultan^ financial circumstances, were more than amply liberal. Yet they took him unawares by night, seized his capital, and rushed his palace with the intention of killing him; they subsequently reached his palace and finally retired when they found it was out of their power to dethrone him, after plundering and setting fire to his town, and this after peace had been con cluded and considerable money payments had been made them. 'ASuch an outrage against th^ Arab cods of honour cannot but recoil on th^ h^ads of Shaikh Sal'sh and his lieutenants, and alienate from them the sympathy of the great majority of the Hinawi tribes, if not the allegiance of many of those who willingly or unwillingly joined him in his effort to seize the Sultanate. The causes of the rebellion may be said to be three * - (1) The weakness of Seyyid Feisal ! s rule,‘ and his un fortunate policy of holding aloof from the tribes and allowing their quarrels either to adjust themselves, or to be settled by the more powerful shaikhs, (2) The restless ambition of Shaikh Saleh, which, dor mant for some years, had been excited by the reception his son and other Shaikhs of his tribe received at the hands of the Sultan of Zanzibar, during their visit to his cppital last year, (3) The comparatively defenceless state of the town against such a coup as that which effected its capture. The garrison was below its normal strength, and most of them were living outside the walls. Against an open attack, how ever, Muscat could have held out till relief arrived, despite the small number of its defenders. The causes of the failure of the rebellion to effect the ob ject of its leaders were also three * - (1) The rapid rallying of the Ghafiri tribes to the succour of their Sultan. ‘ ( 2 ) fact that the movement had not the full support of the most important Hinawi tribes, who were not all devoted to Shaikh Saleh^s cause* (o) Dissensions among Shaikh Saleh f s own particular adherents and an absence of community of interests, 13th February - About 6/30 A.M. Ruttonsee came over and - &gt; *rrsported that th3rs had beon a row in ths palacg; I could get no information from him as to what had occurred and sent out to enquire* In the meanwhile., the Sultants wife and Seyyid Fahad T s widow came in, having made their way over the roofs of the Banians* houses, and told me the Sultants palace had been taken and that d ? f I he had taken refuge at the top of his house adjoining the palace* .hey begged me to protect him. The employment of force outside the Agency being impossible, I sent back their attendant with a message to the Sultan, advising him to come to the Agency, and offering him protection here* The ladies insisted on returning with the. messenger, and, as the way by which they had come was safe, allowed them to do so. The Sultan came on shortly afterwards. I offered him protection for himself and his family in the Agency, should his position admit of no other resort; at the same time I warned His Highness that should he stay here I could not in view of the interests I had to protect, allow of his taking of fensive measures from the Agency. His Highness said he did not wish to seek protection at present, and expres&amp;sd his intention of returning to the old palace. On further consideration, he determined to repair to fort .1 Julali, and sent for his family who followed him there. His brother Seyyid Mahomed had already taken refuge in fort Mirani. In the meanwhile, reports had been received of what had taken place* It appeared, that yesterday evening, small parties of Shaikh Eamood’s men had made their way into the town through the gates without exciting suspicion; that some of them put up at the house of Shaikh Bader bin Saif, that t about 1 A.M. his house was surrounded and all action on his part effectually stopped. The Bab Kabir was then rushed, and the rest of Shaikh Hamood»s men, who had come over from Matrah by the Wadi Kabir, let in. About 4 P.M. the Sultants new palace was rushed and taken, and he and his family took refuge on the roof of the old palace.whsncs lig subsequently came over to the Agency. Arrangements were made for the protection of the British Indian Community, as far as was possible after such a surprise Notices of nationality were supplied to British subjects (who commenced to flock into the Agency) to affix to the doors, and they were advised to keep their shops shut, and avoid all com munication with the rebels; and, if they found an opportunity to bring their more valuable possessions to the Agency for safe custody. I wrote a letter to Shaikh Abdallah, whom I took to be the rebel leader, warning him that he would be held directly res- ooisible for all loss to British life and property, consequent on the grave step he had taken, and quickly received a reply from him to ^.he effect that his followers would be prevented from interferring in any way with British subjects, and adding that what he had done was on behalf of all the Hinawi tribes, a^d that io was an old custon^amongst the Arabs to change their rulers when they did not approve of them. Notices were also sent to British subjects at Matrah, to affix on their houses. British Flags were supplied for the Khoja fort, and British subjects living in the Bazaar at Matrah were advised .to move into the Khoja fort. About 1 P.M. I received a verbal message from the rebels, to the effect that this night or the following morning large reinforcements would ar rive, and that, as they*would attack Matrah on their way to Muscat, it would be well to warn British subjects to look after their property. I sent the Agency Munshi to Shaikh Abdallah with a verbal mes- sage that British subjects had no time in which to remove oh :Ir prop.^rcv to a place of safety, and I warned him again that he would be held responsible for any loss occasioned to British subjects, and that he must warn the coming party to this effect by sending a messenger to meet them, and impressed(32) on tham the necessity of not intarferring with subjects of the BritiBh Government* the Agency Munshi returned with an intimation that this had been done. Also that Shaikh Abdallah would place a party of 7 or 9 of his men in the fort to safeguard our interests, but that in the event of his side being repulsed, these m mi would be considered as being under the protection of the British Government. I replied that I could give no such guarantee, and that the responsibility of protecting life and property rested with the leaders who were the cause of the present disturbance, I added that if his party were thrown back by the Sulcan, I would warn the latter that these men were placed there for the protection of our subjects, and that it seemed to me that in any case they would have plenty of time to escape. Communicated by me verbal ly to His Highness at the 2nd interview I had with him; His Highness said he would bear my wishes in mind. The Haji on taking my first message, saw all these leaders. Shaikh Abdallah, Shaikh Hamood el Jahafi and Shaikh Mohsin bin Aamir al Harthi. They all declared that the people of Oman were tired of Seyyid Feisal f s mis-rule, and that they wanted a Sultan who would really ruler over Oman. Abdallah and Mohsin said that about 11 A*M. a sortie was made from the fort by a reinforcement of Wahabis; they rushed along the beach and fired into the new palace. They were met with a volley which sent them flying up to fort Mirani, with a loss of several of their number. A little later, another party rushed into the old Palace and occupied it. Failing to dislarge'the rebels from the adjoining palace, they retreated after having occupied the house for about an hour. Hamood told the Haji he would be content with no other ruler tha^ Abdul Aziz, and that he would probably send for him from Bombay.5 P.M, Th-g Haji tails ma ha haars from tha ax Vaziar, Sayyid Saaad, that thara is soma talk of tha ratals putting up Sayyid Hamood bin Mahomad bin Salim (aldar brothar of His Highnass Sayyid Saaad) who cama from Zanzibar soma months ago. This man laft yastarday for Habubayih aftar paying a visit to, and taking laava from tha Sultan, As far as I can gathar, tha forca of tha ratals is 150, aug mented by dasartions from tha Sultan»s followers to perhaps 250 or 300, Firing kept up all day at intervals, by the gun ners of both forts and musketry fire, on tha rebels* position in tha palace, from which this fire was powerless to dislarga tham. To tha east sida of tha town they have not panstratad; com munication between tha Agency and tha Banians* houses has con- saquantly bean open. As soon as tha Sultan got into fort Julali, he despatched a Shaikh of tha Beni Boo Ali to Soor to get reinforcements, and other messengers along tha Coast for early relief. His own Wahabis at Sidabh and outside tha town refused to coma forward^ The first affactual reinforcements that can reach him are expected to coma from Wadi Tyni, 14th February P.A.M, Despatched mail 3.3. Simla to Charbar with telegram to Resident, 11/30. Tindul reported 2 shots firad from palace at Agency boat returning with notes. Sent Haji to Shaikh Abdullah to enquire meaning of this. Tha Shaikh was vary profuse in his regrets that such an accident should have occurred, and at once sent to tha palace to ascertain facts and warn all their people to respect the flags of Foreign Nations, Haji reports Shaikh Abdallah told him a party of reinforcements had arrived at Rui, and that Shaikh Saleh was following. 2.P,M, Reports received that the palace had been wrecked and that all the Sultan*s property was being auctioned by thaBodouins Sgvoral Banians bought in furniturs and othar articlss for ths Sultan. British subjsets wsrs forbidden to purchase any of the goods seized from the palace, on* their own account. 4r.P.M, Acting on request made to me by Mr de Crastos on behalf of the Sultan, I sent the Haji and a pattevalla with him to Shaikh Abdallah, and arranged for the safe transport of Seyyid Mahomed^ sssdis and family to Mr de Orastos* house whence they will be removed to fort Julali in the morning. Before the departure of the mail, the Vazier came to me with a message from the Sultan, asking me to arrange for the mail steamer to be sent to Soor to bring up reinforcements. He said the mail steamer would not be detained more than 2 days. I replied that this was impossible for several reasons, and that I was sending the steamer to Charbar to communicate with Government by wire. 15th February - During the night the Sultan f s flag was taken down from the palace and the white Mutowwah flag hoisted, which shows that the rebels are acting in the interests of the Rustak family. About 9. A.M. - I paid the Sultan a visit in fort Julali, and was glad to find him in good spirits; he was expecting reinforce ments to arrive from Tiwi, which might be here by tomorrow, and later on reliefs from Soor and the Jalaan* He seemed..confident of being able to turn out the rebels. With regard to Saleh T s movements, he knows no more than we do. l/30.P.M. - Abdul Rahman bin Eesa came to me from the Sultan with information that His Highness had just received letters from Rashid bin Uzaiz, and Mansoor bin Tamim, to the effect that nothing had yet been seen of any reinforcements for the rebels from the Sharkiyeh; that they were collecting the Ghafiris of the Sammyil at Bid Bid, and were marching to his relief. The Sultan thought they might be here by tomorrow, Abdul Rahman was decidedly of opinion that all the Ghafiris of the Sammyil,(35) including thos3 holding tho Ak ( it ) and th3 Karji (Rahbiyesn) would bsfrisnd th-i Sultan as they suffered at the. hands of Azzan* o/oO.P*M, - Rsceived letter (E) from Shaikh Abdallah, saying portion of Salehts fores had reached Rui, that his father is behind, and that he hopes his father will reach Muscat tonight^ The messenger, who brought the letter, said it was reported that Saleh was at Finga* This is indirect contradiction of the information the Sultan sant me 2 hours ago, and it ssems to me likely that this letter was sent as a kind of antidote to the Sultan*s infor mation, which I was surprised to find was generally known as soon as it was conveyed to me. I ascertained that the news had at once been spread from the fort, possibly this was done with a purpose. If ohaikh Saleh has passed through the passes, it seems that he will be here before Rashid*s relief, but no mention is mad' o.t this in ohaikh Abdallah*s letter. He says he hones Saleh will be here tonight, but makes no mention as to where h is now, beyond chat he is in rear of the advanced party at Rui, which might be any where between the place and Semmed. Meanwhile the Suitan»s position is getting stronger and that of the rebels weaker. Both Julali and Mirani forts are suf ficiently garrisoned, and well supplied with water, provi sions and ammunition. 6,P.M. - Reports received that the Ranizah fort, commanding the water supply at Tuyyan, has capitulated; this does not alter the position much, for it only had a small garrison, which being taken by surprise, had not time to supply itself with food. Firing continued at intervals from both forts on the palace during the ^ay bui^much less than the two previous davs. 16fc|i February 7.A.M. - The Haji sent out to obtain information(36) reports, that the rebels seem weaker today in number and spirits; he did not meet any of the leaders, but the men he saw seemed depressed* They had no news of Saleh. Hamood was in the Sultants palace, where he spent the night, Abdallah and Mohsin in the house given the former by the Sultan. None of these three had yet come out. Dr Jayakar tells me that a letter was sent from Seh U1 Hurwul or Rui on Thursday morning, by one Saood, to Shaikh Andallah, infor- ing him that 70 men had arrived with A1 Harbi, and that Saleh was expected Friday night. This letter was not delivered till yesterday forenoon, and probably accounts for Shaikh Abdallah^ letter to me of yesterdayts date. 9.A.M. - A messenger arrived from Shaikh Abdallah to say he wanted to establish a position at the Mughib, to cut off Seyyid that Feisalts communication with Muscat; but before doing so, out of A respect to me, he sent to know if I had any objection. Haji Derwesh was instructed to reply that this is the quarter of the town in which the Foreign Consulates are situated, and most of the British interests in Muscat, and that I could not approve of fighting so close to these interests, in this direction. This seems to me to be an empty threat, possibly made withja view to a further request to stop Seyyid Feisal^ communication with Muscat. Reports received yesterday that Raniyah fort has capitulated is untrue. The fort is held by a detachment of Wahabis. The Bab Mithayil is also in the Sultan Is hands. 11-A.M. - Received letter from Shaikh Abdallah. Replied thereto in the afternoon. 5.P.M. - Haji reports that he learned from the rebels that Saleh's people were collecting rapidly in Biet A1 Falag, and that Saleh was behind gathering further reinforcements. 5.30 P.M. - A messenger from the Sultan brought me a letter, written to the Wali of Matrah from Biet A1 Falag, saying Saood bin Azzan(37) and Sal9h with a faw man would ba thara bafora Rashid^ paopla and tailing him to look out for himsalf this night* Communicatad contents of this to Jayakar, who was with ma at tha time of receipt, and instructed him to warn British sub jects in Khoja fort to kaap within the fort; tha Banians to keep in buglows in tha harbour, and Goldsmiths &amp;etc., to taka up their quarters tonight in tha small houses round Jayakar*s which he offered to placa at their disposal. Warned Foreign Consuls of the turn events might taka, if this news turned out true* It is thought that the rebels have recaived an accession to their numbers, Y/hich might bring their forca up to about 250; it being supposed that bedouins crept in over the hills in small numbers during the night from Falag and are lying hid amongst the houses in the rebels 1 position. Evar since the assault, the Sultan has been urged by his subjects to make a sortie and attempt to recover the town, and each night I have expected that he would make some move, but none has been made* Of this, two explanations are current; one, that he has no men who could stand up in a hand to hand fight^with the bedou ins who despise the Muscat Hydramis and Wahabis; the second, that he wishes to await the arrival of reinforcements, in order to make his coup thoroughly effectual. Sunday (17th February 3.A.M.), Sultan sent me word from the fort that his reinforcements from Nakl and Taw have arrived and are in Julali. 7.A.M.Ramjan, whom I sent to the Sultan, brings a message from him to the effect that 50 men of the Beni Jabir from Taw have arrived, that more boats are behind, and that the letter he sent me yesterday is evidently false. Also that Rashid and Suleiman bin Saif are on their way with 500 men. The Beni Jabir, who are quartered outside the Agency, inform me to same effect. They say Rashid and Suleiman bin Saifreached Sesb ysBtarday, and that thay ?;ill b3 hsrs at noon today, and that ths passes are held apainst Saleh. The Sultan is said to be in good spirits, but had fever during the night. 10/15 A.M. - Received letter from Shaikh Abdallah, to the effect that he had received a reinforcement of 400 men. Subsequent information brought in from the town that the number of the rebels had largely increased. This accounts for the firing this morning, in the direction of the Riyam Pass and Tuyyan. 11/30.A.M.- Received a visit from Shaikh Mohsin bin Aamir. Asked why he had done what, he had replied that it was for the good of the people of Oman. Asked what was Shaikh Saleh^s purpose and by whom this attack was projected, replied that it was projected by the order of God* and that their purpose was to put another ruler on the throne of Oman. Asked who, replied whomever the people of Oman choose* On my enquiring where Shaikh Saleh was, he replied at Seh A1 Hurwul, about 3 miles from Matrah, and that he had with him and following him about 2000 men. As this Shaikh was not the principal mover, I deemed it advisable to confine the rest of the conversation to the immediate object of his visit, which was the question of Shaikh Abdallah^ people occupying the corner of the town abutting on the Mughib Pass. He pointed out, that his side had undoubted possession of the town of Muscat, and that they had the right to cut off Seyyid Faisal ! s communication between this end of the town and the fort of Julali. The Shaikh added, that they did not wish to fire a shot at the fort and were most anxious to protect and save all property. I replied that I understood the position he had placed before me; but, that their occupation of the locality indicated, was calculated to draw the fire of the fort on to the portion of the town mostly occupied by British subjects and on the Agency itself; that the responsibility for any damage done would rest on his party, and(39) that I daclinsd to go ona way or thg othsr bayond ths tsrms of the lottsr I addressed to Shaikh Abdallah in this connec tion yesterday* I took this opportunity of expressing to the leaders my thanks for the arrangements they had made for the protection of life and property, from the^hands of their bedouins followers. The Shaikh informed me, that the Ghafiris of the Semmyil Valley were all with Shaikh Saleh. Throughout this interview, the Shaikh was profuse in his pro testations that the tribes of Oman desired nothing but the friendship and support of the British Government. Shortly after this interview, finding that this portion of the town had been occupied by the rebels, a notice was issued to British subjects warning of the danger of passing that way. Two badans with 50 men each, pa.ssad^ for Julali. a These are^further detachment for tao and Nakl. l.P.M. - Ibrahim bin Eesa came to show me two letters which The Sultan had received; one from Rashid bin Uzaiz written from Darset to His Highness ! s officials in Matrah, saying he was bringing in reliefs at once. The other from Saeed bin Salim Wali of Khaborah, dated 15th March, to the address of His Highness, intimating that he was oil his way with the Beni Kalban and Beni Shutegt - number not stated. Also gave me a message fron His Highness, requesting I would not allow any rebels to take advantage of the shelter of the Agency walls. I said I would certainly not allow anything of the kind. On sending Haji Derwesh to ascertain the exact position taken up by the rebel party, it was ascertained they had all left his end of the town* Whether because fighting is going on towards the Wadi Kabir, or not, is not known. Ab durahman bin Eesa informed me, that the Sultan*s information was that Saleh and Saood were at Seh A1 Harmal, but that theyonly had 200 man with tham, in which casa Ibrahim saamad to think a pacific tarmination might ba hoped for. The question is, are Saleh and Saood within the immediate vicinity of Matrah or not? The whole thing lies here. But little confidence can be placed / . on the reports brought in* Since the re inforcoments from both sides had come, the guns of both forts had been comparatively silent; a great relief from the cannonading that has been going on day and night since the 13th. Rashid ! s force of between 3 and 400 men passed across the harbour, round by fort Julali. These men have occupied the Moghib Gap. It is thought the Sultan has reasons for not letting them into the fort. 5.P.M.- The Vazier, Seyyid Mahomed bin Azzan, came to me with a message from the Sultan about which I thought it advisable to see His Highness and reply personally. The Vazier was very pale and agitated. I returned with him to the fort, and gave my reply to the message the Sultan had sent to me. The first portion of the message had reference to whether I could and mediate with the rebels and get them to clear out thus save British property. To this I said that I should be happy to afford my good services to both sides when the proper time of mediation should arrive, if I could do so without compromising Government, but that it would be useless my opening communications with them at present, on the lines indicated by His Highness, as they had clearly stated that their ’ object in seizing Muscat was to obtain the Government. I then asked the Sultan if he meant to fight. He said 'of course' but I thought in rather a half-hearted manner. I said, that in that case any proposition of the kind indicated by His Highness, made by me now to the rebels, would be taken as a sign of His Highness 1 s weakness. The second portion of the message had reference to British subjects. His Highness wanted to know who would be held responsibile fordamage dons, should hs dsscond from ths fort and try and rscovsr tho town. I rsplisd that v/hsn tho rebels attacked Muscat, and were taking possession of the town, I warned them that they would be held responsible for all damage to life and property; but that now, that they had held possession for 5 days and the Sultan was confined to the fort, the situation had somewhat changed, as he would in a way be now the aggressor. I further told His Highness that I should wish to clear out British subjects, before there was a general engagement in the town, and asked him if he would agree to a cessation of hos tilities for two days if th.3 other side would do the same# His Highness considered for some time, and at last said he would agree to a cessation of hostilties for two days for the purpose I mentioned, if the other side would aalso agree, which he did not seem to think they would. I left him after a few complimentary messages, that I would send for Mohsin bin Aamir and try and arrange this matter, in which case I was to let His Highness know. However, by the time the interview was over and I had reached the Agency, night had fallen, and I saw the impracticability of getting anything settled then, owing to the dofficulty of o- pening communication with the other side of Muscat in its present state, in the dark.-. 4 I accordingly sent a message to the Sultan, asking him to send me a confidential man to convey a message to him, to say that i did not prefer to move in this matter at this hour and the \ reason why. I do not think there is likelihood of there being an attack from either side this night. Saif bin Hamad came to me on behalf of His Highness, 9.P.M. I explained to him the reason I could take no steps in the matter of communicating with Shaikh Abdallah about clearing out British subjects to-night, but that I would consider themattor to-morrow and l 3 t him know. It should bs added, that, while discussing this question with the Sultan, he asked me whether, in the event of his agreeing to a cessation of hostilities for two days, he was attacked by he rebels, he was at liberty to repel the attack. 1 replied that certainly he was, I received a message from ohaikh Abdallah, to the effect that Seyyid Saood bin Azzan has entered Muscat and that his functions as leader were now over, and Seyyid Saood sent m: his compliments and I requested the messenger to give him mine. me The messenger informed^ on behalf of Shaikh Abaallah, thac Shai Saleh has 1500 men with him, and that he would occupy Matrah tonight. I sent at once round to Dr Jayakar by boat. Thursday ISth - H.M.S.Sphinx arrived in the early morning. I went round in her at once to Matrah, and tound that the ov had not been occupied during the night. During my absence an attempt was made by the oultan^s men to recover the Bab Saghir. The advance was c'.riven back, and fighcing took place in the Banians* quarters, the Sultan’s party loosing about 20 men* On my return, I .receipted a message from His Highness, to the effect that the rebels wore occupying the roofs of the Banians’ houses and shooting his men in the streets. It was clearly time to remove British subjects from the town, which could now be done with the assistance of the steam launch and boats from the Sphinx; the Banians too were getting very frightened. There was not time to get the opposite factions to arrange themselves for a short armistice, nor to settle the differences that would be sure to arise, were the matter to be referred to them,for their acceptance. I found the only way to effect a temporary cessation of hosti lities, in order to clear British subjects from the town, was to make a demand on each side, coupled in terms which would admit of #; i a. m m no refusal. Accordingly, His Highness’s Vazier and ShaikhMohsin bin Aamir woro callod to tha Agency* It was oxiDlain^d to th^m that my objsct was simply to protect British interests | and aletter was given to each to present to his chief, to the i effect that fighting must cease in the town from now (ll/30) until two hours after sunset, and that I requested that orders would be at once issued to cease fighting till that time. At the same time, I told both envoys that I should commence to move the Banians in half an hour without waiting for their replies, I subsequently received communications from each side, saying my wishes would be accepted, and that no fighting would take place till the hour I named. Some references were subsequently made to me by both sides, chiefly the Sultan’s, as to the non-observance of this truce by the opposite party. The outlying positions were the dif ficulty, as it took time to search them. The terms of the truce were on the whole faithfully observed, and far less difficulty occurred than I had expected, with the foes at such close quarters. Through the assistance I received from the Sphinx, all the British subjects were cleared out of the town at 2.P.M. and taken to Mukellah, where they are at present, mostly in native crafts. Dr Jayakar rendered me great assistance in this matter, as he was throughout the business. I personally warned all Europeans that the town would be dangerous after nightfall to-night and they left. The Lawrence arrived about 2 P.M. I went on board and explained the situation as it stands at present to the Resident, also the main lines on which I had hitherto acted. The Resident subsequently landed at the Agency, and returned to the Lawrence about 6/30.P.M. About 5/9.P.M. Reinforcements arrived for the Sultan from Nakl by sea from Matrah, possibly 200 to 300 men. The rebels are practicably in possession of the eastern portion(44) of th3 town, and have boon so sincg tho ropnlse of the Sultan^ men this morning. Th3 Sultants roinforc^monts ar3 in largo numbers bo twoon tho Agency and the Musjid* Tuesday 19th - There has been no movement on either side to-day* The Sultan received a few reinforcements in the morning, supple menting his contingent from Nakl and Tao. The ammineh of the Beni Boo Ali returned from Soor to-day with ^ or 6 men, with information confirming that received by the Sultan by letter from his Wali at Soor, that lOGOof the Beni Boo Ali and Hism were coming to his assistance. This is the contingent on which His Highness relies for the recovery of the town and his power. It was thought they might be in by the evening. It seems strange though that the Tammineh should be in advance of his force, the usual custom of Arab chiefs being to insure the departure of their men by seeing them off themselves. Perhaps this has been left to other leaders and His Highness»s Wali. The very fact of the Tammineh return is a good omen for the Sultan; it will be remembered that this was the Shaikh who sought safety in this Agency with 7 of his men, shortly after the surprise on the 13th. Of the position of the rebels little further is known. They cannot be in strength, else they would have occupied Matrah to cut off the Sultan f s supplies. They say that Seyyid Mohsin bin Kais is expected here in person, and it is thought that he will arrive in two days* time. A very quiet day - no communication made to me by either side. The French Vice-Consul returned to his homo from H.M.S. Sphinx against my advice, all communication between the harbour and the town being virtually closed. Orders issued to the Subedar Com manding my escort not to let any one out of the gates of the Agency without my orders, Wednesday 20th - 8/30.A.M. - About 15 badans arrived from Soor. A.M. H.M.S. Bramble arrived from Bombay. 11/30 received a messaf?* fromthe Agency saying the Tammineh of the Beni Boo Ali wished to see me. Left Lawrence and returned to the shore,,,and sent for the Tammineh. Message returned that he was in advance in the town, I understood his object in seeking an interview was to know the views of Government with regard to his advancing against the enemy, 12, O’clock - Received a visit from Abdurrahman bin Eess^, with a message saying he was glad to hear of the Resident’s arrival and sent salaams to all Europeans from the Sultan, v/anting to know whether there would be any objection to his forces oc cupying Mr Zwimer’s house. Referred him to the American Vice-Consul, Mr Zwimer being an American citizen, A, bin Eesa told me that altogether 1,300 men would be coming from Soor, including those arrived this morning, Juwabeh, 200. Beni Boo Ali, 600. Hishm, (500. The Sultan he said was well and in good spirits. Also gave me th^ following information:- (a) The Beni Ruwahe (25) have left Muscat and returned to their homos, probably owing to some rupture. Their Shaikhs are Mahomed bin Nasir and Mahomed bin Saif* (b) A row has taken place (yesterday) between the and the Haboos with regard to some 'dr .' ,fl* at Rui, in which * one of the latter killed a / A/. and they are now in sepa rate parties, A truce has been effected between them by L Ifert Shaikh Saleh, which is not supposed to last owing to long standing feuds. (c) Seyyid bin Ali Burrowmi was forced to join, by Saleh who told him him this rising was in the interests of Seyyid Earned bin Thuweini, and not in the interests of the Ruatak family, and ho told him it would go hard with him at Zanzibar if ho held aloof. (d) Letters have been received by His Highness from Nasir(46) bin Mahomed, the Shaikh of Mav/aal saying he had reached Mjl t with hi» men, and *was av;aiting the Snltan , s orders. It seems the enemy were 250 strong at first and that Saleh has since joined with about 200 men. Rumours are current that the rebels are &gt; and this would seem to be the case, as the Beni Boo Ali have now advanced into the town unopposed as far as Rui the house about half way to the small gate. Just seen Dr de Crastos, on his return from the Sultan; latter said he was pleased to hear of the Residents arrival, sent salaam* to me and all Europeans; Dr de Crastos said His Highness was in good spirits and very hopeful. 4, P.M, - Dr Jayakar reported to me that he had heard his house had been broken into. I sent a message to the Sultan to say that I would not prevent his forces from advancing along the tops of the houses occupied by British subjects, but that their pro perty must be respected, and that he would be answerable for all loss occasioned by his men breaking into these houses. At the same time, I observed a party of 16 of His Highnessfs men lining a parapat immediately in a line with the enemy and close to the Agency. They were warned off, and subsequently the Sultanforbade his people to take up positions close to the Agency, calculated to draw the rebels* fire on that building. 6/30.P.M. Shaikh Abdullah bin Salim, the Tammineh of the Beni Boo Ali, came to see me; he is an old friend of Sir E.Ross and Col Miles. He asked, as he said, on behalf of the Sultan and himself, whether I would point out to the rebels tomorrow, that Seyyid Feisal had now received a great accession of strength, and get them to clear out of the town and save further dis turbance. I replied that I had as yet seen no signs of the rebels showing an inclination to come to terms, but that I would be willing to mediate when I saw a fitting opportunity of doing so, 8/30. - There has been continual musketry fire in the streets. ft(4?) along a line drawn from tho east corner of the Customs house or past the American Consulate. Thursday 2lat. February. - Mail steamer came in from^he C-ulf ^ 9 and loft for Gwadur about 3.P.M. with telegram and letter from Resident to Foreign Officer r., n .? ?? « . ^ Letter giving a summary of events from 13th up to date, with action taken thereon. From about 2/30 to 6/30, continuoua musketry fire from Sultan’s troops, who had advanced their position on the harbour side up to the Customs house. This fire was aided by the guns of both forts. - Fire not returned by rebels,- Mo advance hitherto made on todayta position, on the left towards the Bab Saghir. It seems that the rebels are giving back in t/ie centre of their advanced position. One rebel was taken prisoner and conveyed to His Highness in fort Julali. As communication is now cut off with that part of the town occupied by the rebels, information as to their numbers and movements is difficult to obtain. Friday 22nd. - The Sultan’s people report, that about 30 of the rebels left the town, but it is not confirmed from any other source. Reports are also current that the rebels have received an accession of strength since yesterday, it being remembered that Shaikh Saleh has sent in the men he had with him at Rui, on hearing that the Beni Boo Ali had taken up a position in the city. All quiet during the day on the harbour side of the town, some firing in the faternoon in the centre and towards the walls. • - w v *' About 2.P.M. - The Banyas c^me on board and complained that s* ^ w v \j r v v.-V ... C • *' J- their shops and houses were being looted. I proceeded on ' ' shore with the Resident, and found that the sentry on the west side of the Agency had been shot a few minutes before.(48) A The Subedar was ordered to bring all his sentries within.the shelter of the Agency walls, and the Agency establishment and all followers were warned not to expose themselves on the west side to stray shots. - The Vaster was sent for in connection with the looting of Banyas* houses, and the following Memo drawn up by the Resident summarises what took place at the interview with the Sultan, who came to the Agency whilst the Vazier was in communication with us. RESIDENT’S MEMO. and Sent for Mahomed bin Azzan, Vazier of Sultan, during interview * A with him got message to say Sultan himself wished to come and v * rf* a ' # W. f.r' . ' • r» ■ no - .a he arrived soon after; later. Shaikh Abdullah bin Salim was sent for, and finally two others came, Haith bin Mahomed A1 dabiri and Rashid bin Eesa of Twi. What was first said to the hazier was afterwards put before the Shaikhs, and thus to the Sultan himself in effects that v/hilo friends of the Sultan and the enemies of none in Oman, but friendly to all its people, and in no way objecting to the pro- sonce of their Shaikhs and their followers who came to the aid . .• :-.v c of their ruler, wo imparatively objected to any looting of T v &lt; British property. It was equally intimated to the Shaikhs that their followers must be absolutely given to understand that they must restrain from all violation of British property, and it was forcibly pointed out to them that their vessels, which brought them here, were entirely at the mercy of our armed force on the seas, and that if British property v/as plundered by their fol lowers, it would be in our power at once to seize or destroy their boats, and that the doing of this might become necessary. S 1 'W &lt; /u? &amp; ’ Aw .*?! /Tt'o/rtf fw if.®.’ n '^.-9 They seemed to understand and accepted the position, and were dismissed in order to make the necessary communication to j c i i? *u r &gt;' aft it* r oif# rsJ f j their follov/ers. ... /t - ' .1 '&lt; ' a*? *r.u* - r? o • Je/t , ff* 2 . * iw /.c The Sultan at one time professed to be ready to take the res- *(4b) roaporisibllit'y of any plTinderinpr by lia side, and seemed dis posed to argue that only the rebels were to blame. He asked how it would be if the houses, after being locked up or secured by his party, were broken into by others. He was told, that broadly speaking a ruler was responsible for the safety of all property, and that here it was further than this a question of quite evident plundering by his own people. The Sultan could give no idea of his plans, or of his pros pects of success. He is perhaps hoping for further reinfor cements of the Hishm. I informed him at departure, that it would have been a sa tisfaction to me, and would have gratified Government, if I had been able to report by the mail just going out, that there was a prospect of an eariy solution of the present troubled position^ His Highness said finally, he hoped there might soon be good news to give, possibly tomorrow. To this it might be added, that v/hen the Sultan hinted at ac cepting responsibility for all damage done by his followers, it was impressed on him, that in the present state of affairs, we looked for more than the mere acceptance of responsibility; we look for measures to be taken to stop further robbery of British property. It is reported that a Banya has been wounded in the leg from a shot; the man was in the town at his own risk. 2 0 AJ oJ gat f A Saturday 23rd February.9,A.M. - The Haji reports that Seyyid il 1 ft 8 -T 1 V Hamood bin Azzan has arrived with about 50jnen. The Sultan's people say that the Hishm and Beni Rashid - 800 - probably • ' • S» V . - t ' i * Vfi '• * S'. 350 - have arrived as far as Jussa, and are coming on slowly, the wind being contrary. There are reports that Hamood al Jahefi has been wounded - not confirmed. Reports from the town say that about 100 of the Beni Kalbanz (CO) arrived during.the night, and have been seut by the Sultan p° Kulbooh, to hold the hills in that direcJ,J.on« Reinforcements of the Beni Kalban and Umr tribe, about /r ’ came in during, the day^vfor the Sultan.: and also the Beni Rashid • ** r: c- * r and Umr. 4/50.p.M. - Sent Othman with a letter to Seyyid Saood, warning him about the pillaging at the Sanyas’ temple by his followers, and also one of our sepoys having been dangerously wounded by a shot fired from the direction of Seyyid Fahad’s house, and shots dropping round the Agency and in the harbour near our ships, and intimating that unless acts of this kind wore stopped at once, we should take steps to stop them in concert with our force in the soa. Othman returned with roply which I connot consider satisfactory. Seyyid Saood also sent me a letter from Shaikh Saleh to his son Shaikh Abdullah, of jerterdayts date, the purport of which ia , About 5/30.P.M. - Saw a shot from a Martini Henry strike the hill close to the buoy near the North eastern corner of the ■ * - ~ . # * . p Agency. All the Sultan’s men sitting near the buoy got up and S t y&amp;fi. .. « *1 *&gt;S v f-■ -TW H fi JH It • i took cover close to the Musjid, This shot was fired from Seyyid » 1 ^-i ^ Vw ** &gt; * J . ‘c J.. 'i ir.v v S\aJ * v-' Fahad’s house or the palace, and it was probably in firing at the Sultan’s men in this direction yesterday, that our sepoy was struck, Othman reported a large increase to the rebel force since he saw them last 5 days ago; he says they are now very strong. Sunday 24th February .8.A.M. - The Haji reports that yesterday(51) afternoon he heard that Shaikh Earned bln Humeyed, the /Pammif neh of the *. v ^ iCv, had joined^.Saleh with 300 or ' \ 400 men. j w si wi, e • « Thia waa the Shaikh who wrote to warn, the Sultan against v Hamood’s party, but the letter only reached the Sultan after he had returned to the fort after the surprise. , The Haji heard from persons who had been told by Hamad bin Nasir the Wali of Sohar, who is taking a leading part on the &lt; Sultan*s side, that the Shaikh Hamad bin Eumeyed had an inter view with the Sultan yesterday in the fort, at which he point ed out the trouble that the present state of affairs entailed on all sides, to which the Sultan would not: agree* Today the Haji heard from the Sultan’s people^, that Shaikh Hamad bin Humeyed did not visit the Sultan personally but sent a messenger. There is a general report in the town that the Hinawis have declared a.general war against the Ghafiris in the Sharkiyeh, on acesunt of the Beni Boo Ali having come to the Sultan’s assistance. Nothing was done on either side last night. The rebels ap pear to be very strong, and. to be^ playing a waiting game, knowing that the Sultan cannot turn them out, and that the longer the present state of affairs continues, the more it will tell on Feisal’s purse and resources. 12. The Resident received a long petition from the-Ban- yas this morning, setting forth the hardships and .loss of pro perty to which they are exposed, and requesting that if a ces- satipn^of hostilities could not be effected, that at least the opposing parties be desired to make a truce for a week, in order that they might be able to remove their valuables and property from Muscat. v . .iu. ... l.H.M. - Had an interview with the Vazier for whom I had sent. I first of all told him that we had been expecting, some at tempts on His Highnessts part to recover possession of histown, but that, notwithstanding: tho fact that he had rooelved all the ire infer cements he expected, nothing asyet had been n,-i done, and I said we had a right to ask how long this present ■ positioi*'t&gt;£ affairs was ^to be allowed ta continue* S’he Vafc^ ier replied, that the Sultan was always urging the Shaikhs to make an assault but without result, that the Shaikhs were now in consultation and that he hoped something would soon be done. The Vazier, however, gave me his opinion that neither the Belli Boo Ali nor the other tribes intended to sell their lives, a rather obvious conclusion, since they have been here 5 days and done nothing, u » . ' With regard to the note the Haji received this morning, desiring him to inform me that the rebels had occupied vhe Banyas 1 temple and that he wanted to fire on the temple from the fort and asked for my views,. I told the Vazier that we had not hitherto placed any impediment in the way of His Highness^ movements of war, but that the further destruction of British property was a great responsibility to incur, and that it rested with His Highness to consider whether he should incur this further res ponsibility should it be necessary to dislodge the rebels from the position in connection wit a general advance of his forces on the enemy; in any case there would be no objection in doing so with his forces remaining quietly under cover showing no signs of advancing, J v . I further pointed out, that it was very undesirable to draw the fire on the rebels on to the corner.of the Agency and near our ships in the harbour, and I further requestedthai^ie would order his men to keep close to the Musjid, and not expose themselves ~ near the buoy by the steps, and also thatjhe would send his boats round outside the harbour and not across it, I added, that in making these requests we had no intention ©^putting him at any disadvantage, and that it was simply to guard our people against stray sho/s; he was always at liberty to use the(03) harbour for an assault by sea, but in that case X trusted no assault would be made until I be given time to warn our ships to close out of the line of fire. I reported These messages A to Haji Derwesh and sent him with them to His Highness in company with the Vazier. The Vazier told me pri vately that negotiations for peace had been proceeding yes r terday, between the former Wali of Sohar, Nasir bin Mahomed, and Shaikh Saeed bin Ali al Harthi, and that the rebels told Naair bin Mahomed they would not entertain proposals for peace except through the mediation of the Agency. Although the * Vazier assured me that His Highness refused to make peace, and certainly did not propose^t to the rebels, the above looks as if the overtures came from him. 2.P.M. - Th.e Haji returned - His Highness said he would not fire on the temple, and.would keep his men out of ranp-e from the house of Seyyid Pahad by day, but would want them to oc cupy the steps by night. He would also order all boats to go round the island, and not cross the harbour. Monday 26th 8.A.M. - The Beni Kalban and the under Saeed bin Salim al Omani, took the Bab al Mathayul Saif bin Hamad bin Saif; the man who killed Shaikh Hilal bin ifahir led the advance and was the first to open the gate. ~i * ■ ^ ^ •/- was also taken. The Sultan f s forces on the left have ad vanced about 100 yards towards the Bab Saghir. rf1 he rebels are still in the Banyas* temple. About 300 of the Hishm arrived today from cfalaan. These men will go round to the Bab Mathayul this evening. , • The Sultan must have now between 3000. and 4000 men inside and outside the town. • t. r f . 5.p,M. - The fighting on the left has been without result, the Sultan’s loss was 2„killed and 2 wounded. 5.P.M. - Abdurrahman bin Eesa came to see me; he says the rebels are looting the bazaar. I should doubt this, forOttoman passed through the bazaar 3 days ago, and it was then ■antonetoed. Sent him and the Haji into the Musjid and other houses below the Agency, to see whether any British property*.had been stored there by the Sultan’s people* who are said to have looted someK*houses 3 days ago* Nothing was seen* The foreshore the Haji said was stinking* 5/30 P.M* - Had a conversation with the Resident, in which the question of sending for one of the rebel leader or rather of arranging a meeting with him was discussed* as the situation was so slow in developing. The points to be discussed with the leader to be settled tomorrow morning. Presumably they would be to ascertain their intentions.&lt; Tuesday 26th* - Nothing done by either side during the night. The Sultan’s position no further advanced. The state of affairs is as far off a solution as ever. The rebels content themselves with holding their position, about 4/6 of the town; they are probably not strong enough to throw the Sultan’s troops back, and invest the forts* On the other hand, the Sultan’s forces are doing practically nothing. The Sultan is up in fort Julali, and the efalaan reinforcements, on whom His Highness’s hopes chiefly rested, show no signs of making a determined attack. « £ It is the general opinion here, that the Sultanas forces will not attack the strong position held by the enemy, unless His Highness comes down from the fort and leads in person, which it is not thought he will do. . ^ This want of action is commented on by his forces, and it is rumoured that they say that they will not sell their lives whilst their ruler stays in safety in the fort. Also a com parison has been drawn between the present situation and the attack on Rustak, when His Highness did not advance against .. ~ the enemy personally, and his forces were thrown back and he had to beat a hasty retreat. ^ JShowed above to Reaidont; subsequent action taken is shown in RESIDENT’S memo. lr ^he position this morning appearing as hopeless of solution as ever, landed with Sadler and sent for Vazier and one of the Sultan’s councillors, to enquire what the position is, and what hopes and plans the Sultan has, and what prospect he can _ hold out of order being restored. w ‘ V &amp; It being now the 9th day since my arrival, and the 14th since the Sultan’s authority was overthrown, His Highness having in the interval received very large reinforcements, so that his W 6 *- • ir . followers number 3 or 4 times the force of the rebels, it is time to ask when this disorder and extreme danger to property are to cease. In the desire to refrain in any way with the Sultan’s freedom of action for the restoration of his authority, he has been left unfettered in his operations for this long period, but it is the first duty of every ruler to insure order and security for life and property to all resting under his power; and the failure to do so iflust invlovO the most serious responsibility. It appears to me that this responsibility has now reached an extreme point, there being nothing to show that the force at h the disposal of the Sultan is being used to any purpose in view of the heavy obligation resting on him to restore his authority, and provide for the security in life and property of those in Muscat and especially the very large number of aur subjects. It will be a matter for extreme regret if by the next mail, after more than a fortnight of the state of things, I am com pelled to report to My Government that practically nothing has been done,' notwithstanding that large resources are available, to end the deplorable state of things now existing. It is certain that this news will- be received by Government with the greatest concern.Tho time lias arrived to demand a clear exposition of jwiiat we. are to expect. In addition to the above, the Vazier and Rashid bin Uzaiz were clearly told, for the information of the Sultan, that, though not desiring to interfere with the Sultan*s operations, it is necessary, failing a definite assurance of something being achie ved to restore order, for us to insist on a truce for some days to afford opportunity for securing the property of our people* They were dismissed to communicate the above to the Sultan and to bring hisreply* &gt; . In reply what was said to the Vazier and Rashid bin Uzaiz, as recorded in the foregoing note, and in accord with its general tenour, they said that at the time of the summons, they had come down from the fort by order of the Sultan to see that no damage was done to property, and that they had found all apparently secure* That an attack on both sides of the town was being urged by the Sultan; that as to when a determined advance was to be made, it would be directed by G-od, and that war was carried on by stratagem (as an abstract proposition), that the rebels are notnet more than l/4 of the Sultan’s forces, which is 3 to 4000 (the rebels being only 4 to 500, besides 300 with Saleh at Rui) that a further force is being sent round to the water gate in view to a combined strong attack from both sides; that it is hoped some definite result may be attained before the departure of the mail. They suggested as regards mischief (to property) by rebels that they (the rebels) will be liable; but were clearly told that this could not be admitted, that we look to the ruler and none other, a ruler being always responsible for tl*© » •protection of life and property M . After waiting till 6 P*M. A message was sent to the Vazier,through the Haji» requesting to know whether we might expect an answer. A reply came back to say that His Highness would send the Resident a reply to what he was asked in 3 days from now. A reply of this kind, after the Resident had been kept waiting so long, and in view of the fact that the mail was to leave in two days, and the Resident had particularly said he wished to be in aposition to acquaint Government v/ith &amp;is Highness*8 intentions and course of action, ;would not be looked on as otherwise than extremely unsatisfactory if not down right uncourteous; the Resident at once sent a letter to His Highness, copy of which I have on record. Hr Jayakar reported that his boat was fired on 5 times, by a /- / f Cf £&gt; ; / man belonging to the rebels from j) ./L wa ' s doubt less done by a bedouin, who did not recognise our Flag. But such proceedings must at once be put a stop to, and an expla- 1 V nation demanded. I am only deterred from demanding an ex planation at once, by the danger of trying to open communica- v tion with the rebels so late in the evening, in the present disturbed state of the town. Wednesday 27th. Nothing done during the nighti 8.P.M. Fur-* ther reinforcements arrived for the Sultan from Jalaan, Wrote to Seyyid Saood bin Azzan regarding the firing on Jayakar It is reported to me by my head clerk, that Tuesday evening, - * i some of the Banyas repaired to the temple occupied by the j ■ &gt; rebels, and removed their valuables. From what Ruttonsee said to Haji Derwesh it would appear that very little, if any looting was done there by the rebels, and after the exagger ated accounts of the Banyas gave of their loss in their peti tion to the Resident and myself, they would feel bomd to maintain still that the temple had been robbed. The whole objection of that petition would appear to be to induce the Political Officers to interfere on behalf of theSultan; for if Seyyid Feisal does not regain his authority, man' of the lending Banyas would lose in money advanced to him and in recovering accounts* The following may be near the mark * • / - V . j.

Asks for reply. 2/30. - There has been heavy fire in the early morning in the dire tion of the Ryiam Pass, which the Sultan»s people say is now in their possession, and later on in the town.

He told me Saood bin Azzan sent his salaams, and said he would take care that none of his men fired on a boat with a flag# Saood told him to tell me, that they had received a letter from Rashid bin Uzaiz in which the latter said the Sultan intended giving his country to the French# He further said, that he was sending this letter to his father, whence it would reach us in the same way as his us father f s letter reached today via Matrah# A Thursday 28th, 7/30. - Haji reports that it is confirmed that the Sultan!s forces have captured the new temple# He says it was only defended by 3 men, of whom one was killed. It appears that the total loss yesterday was 4 rebels killed, and of the Sultan^ men 4 killed and 3 wounded. .&gt; No attempt was made yesterday on the Bab SaghirJ the Sultan f s people say they did not take the Ryiam Pass yesterday. Went on early to Lawrence where engaged all day with Resident in connection with report to Government, and two telegrams one via Jask, the other via Karachi, detailing present position. Captain Pelly came on board at request of Resident, and gave opinion, that only, effective means of employing force to clear the town of the rebels, should our policy tend in,that direc tion, would be to shell the town which would probably set it on fire, and in any case cause great destruction to property which is chiefly British. Only 40 Blue Jackets available for landing, and this would be a great risk. Both mails left this evening# Practically no firing in any direction today. His Highness is reported to have come down from the fort and conferred with the Jenebeh Shaikhs, about what not yet known. Friday 1st March* 10.A.M. - No firing throughout the night, nor this morning. It lokks as if peace negotiations were ’■*' proceeding between the parties, and Dr Jayakar tells me theBanyas, who are in constant comnmnication with the fort, believe this to be the case, &amp; They say the Snltan has offered the rebels 3,000 dollars to clear out, but that they do not accept as His Highness refuses to guarantee their safety. The Haji reports that His Highness paid a visit to the French Vice-Consul, after seeing Shaikh Abdallah bin Salim, but does not know what transpired, French Vice-Consul came over this morning* and told me he had seen-the Sultan yesterday. r Sent Othman with letter to Saood bin Azzan, in reply to his denying that any of his men had fired on cTayakar f s boat, and instructed Haji to ask him for Rashdd*s letter. On his return, Othman was shot through the head when in Virjee’s house whither he had accompanied Virjee^ servant. The shots came from the Sultan , s side and^l must either have been fired at random, as the Sultarn's men have been doing all day, or purposely fired at the house on the chance of some of the enemy being in it. Neither Othman nor the man with him could have been seen in the room from the outside. Received a letter from Seyyid Saood bin A^an. In reply to Haji f 3 note, Saood said that Rashid's letter was with his father, that its contents were that the Sultan had determined to give his country to the French, and that Saleh's was to the effect that whatoever Cod wished would be done, but that this matter did not rest with Seyyid Feisal, nor with anyoneelse. About 5/30.P.M, - A cloud of smoke was seen to arise from the palace as if an explosion had occurred, but no noise was heard; volumes of smoke followed. It would seem as if the rebels had attempted to blow up the palace. 8.P.M. - Mr de Crastos tells me the Sultan is doing all 'in his power to urge the Shaikhs to make an advance and attack the enemy resolutely, offering them anything they want, but that all they do is to say ' Inshaallah'.Mr de Grastoa thinks they have simply come to live on the Sultan, and the latter, he says, has told them that if they did not intend to fight they had better leave him and return to their homes* Saturday 2nd March, 7/30. - Had a long conversation with the Vazier at the Agency. After asking after His Highness’s health, on behalf of the Resident and self, I told the Vazier, that the Resident re gretted that he had not received the information His Highness had promises to give him before the departure of the mails, regarding his hopes of a speedy termination of the present state of affairs, and what his plans were. Vazier replied that His Highness had instructed him to reply to such a message as this, that he was very sorry, but that the day the mails left he was very busy, and in fact had nothing new..to communicate. I then asked the Vazier his opinion of the present situation. He told me that the Sultan was disgusted with the tribes who had railed round him, and was quite aware that they had not come to Muscat with his interests at heart. He had told the Vazier that the Ghafiris had collected men on their own ac count against the Hinawis, and that the matter was now a question between these two factions. The Vazier was practically incensed with the Shaikh of the Beni Boo Ali, who, he said, did not mean to attack and was bent on prolonging the present situation. It seems that the tribesmen would ship the rations and ammunition they receive on to their Badans, instead of using them in the cause of the Sultan. It was the Vazierts decided opinion that the tribesmen could do nothing for the Sultan, and that they would not make a « determined attack. , ^ t The Vazier then told me - not on behalf of the Sultan - thatr (62) peace overtures were in progress, and he showed me a letter from Shaikh Saleh to Rashid bin Uzaiz, which reads as follows; dated 2nd Ramzan lsts&gt;March. tt Your have said what you have; the whole affair rests with God, To Him belongs the kingdom. He is all powerful. If you are thinking of arranging for the general good come to me and we will consult”. This, the Vazier told me, was in reply to a letter from Rashid suggesting an interview. It appears that several letters have passed between the-Sultan»s side and Shaikh Saood bin Ali, the Shaikh of the Harthi; (whom the Sultan tried to put on Saleh) who is with Saleh at Rui, and ‘ promising on both sides; and that a meeting between Saleh and Rashid had been suggested by Saood. I asked the Vazier what the terms.would be, supposing a peace-was negotiated*? He said it would be impossible to say at present, for no one toiew Saleh’s present intentions. Had Saleh been strong, he remarked, he would undoubtedly have taken Matrah and moved to depose the Sultan; but since the Ghafiris had mustered in strength, and Saleh had received no large reinforcements and was not apparently backed by a general Hinawi movement, he thought his plans must have been conveniently modified. The Vazier thought the terms of peace might possibly take the form of a cession of territory. Saood, he said, was a mere puppet in Saleh’s hands, and that Saleh was nKat heart attached to i his interests. Further, that the rebels now thought themselves in a fix, and would be anxiouh to come to terms and effect their retreat. Hamood, the Vazier thought, was in communication with Abdul Aziz. T he Vazier also said, that Shaikh Abdullah bin Salim had written to the Naceen and the Ghafiri tribes of the Dhahireh to come to Muscat, but had not yet found a means of despatching his letters. When Saleh comes to hear of this, he will be anxious(63) to clear out when he can* I spoke to the Vazier about his men having shot Othman, and told him that this was the result of the careless firing of the SultanIs followers, who were afraid to face the enemy in a local attack and did nothing but kept up a purposeless fire on homes, on the chance of there being some of the rebels in there* The Vazier admitted this, and expressed his great regret at the occurrence* On the question of the looting, 1 told the Vazier that it was reported that the house of Khoja Chinoy had been plundered* He partially admitted this, and said the Sultan had taken further steps to restrain his followers. I then spoke privately to the Vazier on the subject of the insinuations of the rebels as to French interference. He assured me that they were without foundation,&gt; and that they were undoubtedly put forward with an object. He was present with the Sultan when he visited the French Vice-Consulate, and not a word about French interference was said. The Vazier was very strong on this point. I again warned Vazier about not letting the Sultan»s boats cross the harbour. On the subject of a cessation of hostilities, the Vazier said that the Sultan would not be likely to agree, and would cer tainly refuse any suggestion made by Saleh to this effect, and it would give the latter time to get further reinforce - ments. To this I remarked, that we saw but little difference between a state of truce and the present state of inactivity, as no thing was being done on either side* The Vazier gave me to understand that Shaikh Saleh was ex pected in Muscat, and might be there now. The Haji tells me, he believes Shaikh Saleh is now in Muscat, and also that the Wali of Kurriyat has just told him that the( 64 ) Beni Boo Ali have sent off to their country 3 badans full of rice, ammunition, etc.. Received a letter from Shaikh Saleh ( ) and replied to it. Resident's letter was also sent through the Sultan. During the day, Chinoy went to the Resident and complained of certain of his property having been looted. Later on in the afternoon, the following Banyas came and reported loss as fol lows; Virjee Ruttonsee Upper part of the shop broken into and • property removed. Has 32,000 dollars and 700 rupees in iron safe below, and 35,000 dollars of goods and silver- ornaments, his own and others. Does not know what has been taken of this. Shop broken into and 460 dollars cash stolen. Shop broken into, 350 dollars cash and 100 dollars mortgaged property stolen. House broken into, and 100 dollars of property taken. Nanji Ramdass Khimji Nuraie Kaliandass Nanji, At 5/30.P.M. the Resident's note. V Note of communication to Sultan. Position appears unchanged and nothing whatever seems achieved towards restoration of order and security; this is the 18th day. Meanwhile, anxiety for safety of British property must necessarily increase, and constant reports of plundering are made. The position is becoming intolerable, and the ruler has not only failed utterly to restore order, but even to give reasonable as surance of his prospect of doing so. The interests at stake are too large to admit of this state of things being indefinitely acquiesced in, or of assurances as to compensation for loss beingtaken as adequate. There is no other course but to require the Sultan’s consent to a truce for 3 days, to allow of re* moval, as far as possible, of valuable property, and to demand the same of those opposed to him, intimating to them that the Sultan has accepted, and requiring them to send responsible persons to represent them in arranging all the details neces sary thereto, in order to secure perfect safety during the is to be period. This done tomorrow. I went to the Sultan at 6.P.M. and communicated the tenour of above to him, in the presence of the Vazier. His Highness at once acquiesced, and said he would have done so the first day the question of a truce was mentioned, had he not been so busy and so worried. He will send his Vazier to me in the morning with a memo of the conditions for which he will stipulate, chiefly being, I take it, (l) That the truce only refers to the town and the villages immediately round it. (2) That operations about Ryiam are to be free. (3) That neither side advance. (4) That no firing whatever be allowed in the town. I found His Highness more dejected than I have yet seen him. He apologised for any apparent neglect on his part to answer the Resident’s communication about information for the mail, and he asked me most petiously why I had not pitched into the Beni Boo Ali for their apathy to their Sultan’s interests. I find from the Sultan’s demeanour, that Rashid’s negotiations today with Shaikh Saleh have not been successful, and that His Hipfrness is in a bad way. He asked me if I had heard that Saleh intends to set up Hamad bin Thuweyni, and I said I had. He complained bitterly of the rebels trying to burn, his palace. Sunday, 3rd March, 9.A.M. - Went on board the Lawrence, with Vazier and Haji, reports having reached me that the Beni Boo Ali had removed 200 bags of rice from our godowns, and shippedthem to soor during the night. Went on shore, and sent for Shaikh Abdullah bin Salim and Saleh bin Thuyeni Shaikh of the Beni Rasib. They said there were many tribes in Muscat, and that their people had done no looting. Asked about the bags carried off during the night, Abdullah said he himself sent away 20 bags of rice given him by the Sultan, and he does not know what his people have done. Asked if he does not know he is responsible for the acts of his fol lowers, admits his responsibility. Asked what he came here for if not to loot, replied to aid the Sultan who had been attacked. Asked in what way he aids the Siiltan and for how long his aid would be required: said he has lost 10 men already, that when he arrived the enemy had already a very strong position, practically unassailable, talked a good deal in excuse of inactivity. Could not say how long they will stay. Said that when he- first came, he told the Political Agent that they would leave the town if British cleared the rebels out, to which we replied, that if we were to do this, of what use was his coming here. Answers to everything, - ,r God knows M . A deceitful old hypocrite who has employed his time here in looting British and Arab property. The interview was suddenly broken off, before we could deal with the question of his looting, by our discovering that he had never warned his men to observe the truce which was to commence at 12 0 1 clock. It was imperative that he should go and do this, and our time was occupied till nightfall in arranging the terms of the truce. Rashid bin Uzaiz was, however, v/ith me off and in from 6/30 to * 8/15. He has given this Shaikh a strong warning about his pro ceedings tonight, and is himself posting men at the Musjid, to give intimation if any loot is brought during the night. I understand, though, that all the godowns remaining intact nearhis tribe will have to be dealt with after the present crisis is ended. INTERVIEW WITH ^ *#f SHAIKH MOHSIN BIN AAMIR AND ANOTHER OP THE HARTH. Asked why they had acted as they had done: replied they wished for a ruler on whom all of them should bo agreed. On it being pointed out that all the Hinawis were not with him they replied that they were, although the tribes wore not with them all in strength*, they were all coming and had repre sentatives from all the principal Hinawi tribes. Only 5 of the Beni Boo Hassan, but the tribe was with them and would be here soon. As regards Zanzibar, they said they had acted on their own behalf and not on behalf of the Sultan of Zanzibar. J On being told, that so far from having come here to restore order they had done nothing but caused disorder for 20 days, they said they had arranged to stop looting and restrain their followers from robbery. Asked how Saleh proposed to make reparation for property stolen replied Saleh had wealth. Being told that they must have been aware that Seyyid Feisal was the friend of Government, that they had attacked him treacherously, and caused great injury to British property and danger to life: they said they did not consider the Sultan a friend of Government, that had thought him so and had he ruled the country well, they would not have attacked him. Asked why they thought he was not a friend of the British Government, as he has visibly been their friend for 7 years, they said:- M it was clearer than the sun at noon”. Being told that British subjects were satisfied with Seyyid Peisal f s rule, and that all carried on their business in per fect safety till 20 days ago since which there has been(66) nothing hut complaints of danger to life and property. Replied British subjects were happy with Seyyid Feisal, so long as he was supported by His own people, but that when he fell out with them, their disturbances arose* Asked how long they supposed the British Government was going to put up with the present state of affairs, they said war was day was, it might last one or twenty* A !T And are we to put up with this state of security for 20 days?” n Cannot sat - It depends on what Government thinks.” Asked what their intentions ares replied, to have a ruler who will rule the country* They would first offer it to the Sultan of Zanzibar, and if he refused, and Government did not oppose, then they would give the Sultanate to one of the sons of Azzan bin Kais* On it being pointed out, that according to them, the country would in the meanwhile be without a ruler s they said the matter could be settled at once by wire. We pointed out that so far from their choice representing the general oponion of the country, there was no evidence to show that it represented the general wish of the Hinawis, as their numbers weee small and the Ghafiris here outnumbered them 4 to 1. They said the will of Shaikh Saleh was the will of the Hinawis, and that they had chosen the Sultan of Zanzibar, because they knew him to be friendly to the British Government. On being told, that it was only possible to report to Govern- ment that the Sultan, who for many years has been recognised as friend by Government, has many followers here, and that a small number of nis enemies have thrown the place into confu sion and caused injury and damage to British subjects, and that this was a most serious matter and would bo regarded as such by Government: no reply was made. (The question of a report to Government was again mooted by Shaikh Mohsin, just before he left, and he was referred towhat had been said*) Seyyid Mahomed bin Azzan, and Shaikh Rashid bin Uzaiz, were 1 then summoned, and the following terms were agreed to* The Sultan4representatives, however, refused to sign on the ground of the peculiar temperament of their ruler* Shaikh Saleh f s representatives represented that Shaikh Saleh knew nothing about the terms, and did not wish to; that he did not care about a truce, but that, as it was our wish, they would agree to anything and sign anything. Eventually, as it was getting late, and the Haji had to see the representatives of Shaikh Saleh back to their quarters, it was arranged that each side should take its copy, keep a copy itself, and return one copy signed. I have since heard from the Sultan that his only objection is to a possible prolongation of the truce, which he trusted we would not enforce unless absolutely neces sary, as it was burdensome to him. I replied to Shaikh Rashid, who brought the message, that we would only consider the Sultanas wishes, but that possibly we might require the truce to extend to Thursday midday* (jfcMQ b #• - TERMS OP TRUCE. (1) Truce to be from now till 2 hours fater sunset, Wednesday. But to be further extended should the Resident so find neces sary. (2) During this period, no fighting or advance to be made by either side in the town.

Monday 4th March. - Went on early in the morning* round the bar ricades of both sides, and insisted on the men of both sides comin?' down fr m the upper stories of houses. This was principally necessary, with a view to stop aimless and indiscriminate fire, especially onjthe Sultan*s side. Finding that neither side would open the gates leading on to the Customs house from distrust of each.other proceeded with the Haji to each gate and had it opened. Saw Shaikh Saleh, Saood, Hamoo, Hamood al Jahafi and Mohsin. Shaikh Saleh referred to his complaint of last nigfct about occupation by Sultan*s men of Hilal bin Aamirts housej replied that Sultan had assured me it had been occupied in the earlymorning yesterday, before the truce commenced, and that in the present state of affairs it was impossible for me to as certain which statement was correct* Received letter from Saleh, complaining of his men being taken down from the upper rooms of houses; replied that I had desired this to be done on both sides, to guard against in discriminate firing, in accordance with the 7th article of the truce# Several complaints received during the day, about bedouins ; not allowing the Banyas to go to their shops. ^aji either took them to, or wrote to rebel leaders, to send men with them to their shops. H.clerk reports, many of merchants say rebels have refused in many Cases to allow bags of rice and dates to be removed. No particular instance brought to my knowledge. Maji reported that ho had seen tha,t Semayyal people had taken advantage of the truce to advance one of their barricades some 50 feet. At once sent for Rashid bin Uzaiz, told him this could not be allowed, and sent him to have it put back in its original place,' which was done. Rebels sent remons trance against proceeding of Sultan’s men in this connection. Jo ^ t &amp;■ i},'- 3■ iCC r - -*wO - *«•'-*-•' ' mm'* v\ : Also said they had reoccupied the upper rooms of their houses, as Sultan’s men had done so. Rashid refused to clear his men out of the upper stories of houses occupied by them, on ground that Sultan had written to me, ignoring the reply I had sent. A great deal of the property was removed in the course of the day, and probably most of the British subjects’ valuables, books and portable property has been taken out of the town. Marked difference between the attitude of the Khojas and Banyas} the former expressed their thanks for the truce, and made no complaints during the day; the Banyas were full of , d . complaints, and there is reason to believe are grossly exag-o (72) exaggerating thoir losses, especially ipash* Of course,the present crisis has told most on the Banyas, who have been turned out of theiLr homes* On the whole, the truce has answered today, fully as well as one could have hoped; com plaints from both sides there were bound to be* Shaikh Saleh told the Haji today, that he had received letters to say that Seyyid Feisal bin Hamood will be at Rui tonight, with 00 of the Hijrieen; that he was to take Matrah, but that Shaikh Saleh would halt him and his party at Rui till the conclusion of the truce* Also that the Beni Boo Hassan had absolved themselves from tfhe Rama-zan fast, and wore all on their way here* ^azier told me privately this morning, that the Sultan has sent sums of money to Salefc^s following outside the town, probably in the direction of Rui* rn he following are said to be favourable to the Sultan*s interests.

Tuesday 5th March. - General complaints that Bedouins would not allow our subjects to remove their goods • particularly rice and dates. //rote to Shaikh baleh, and sent Derwesh to him; satisfactory reply received, and the work of removing property, on the whole satisfactorily carried on* It is clear that the rebel leaders are losing control over their followers, since their numbers have increased: the houses and shops of British subjects are many and much scattered, and this r* ' AJ*. business is naturally full of difficulties. Shaikh Saleh told the Derwesh, that Feysul bin fiamood arrived y r.- at Seeb with between 4 to 500 men. AReceived trivial complaints from the Sultan? through the Vazier, that the rebels had raised one of their barricades up higher. I pointed out what the Sultan’s own men had done yesterday, and said that the terms of the truce forbade on either side an advance only. I told the Vazier? that either the rebels must lower their barricades? or the Sultan’s men were at liberty to raise theirs, provided they did not impede the passage of British subjects. His Highness particularly asked that the Haji should not be sent to the rebels in this connection. f -he Vazier privately told me, he hoped Government would look into the unfortunate state of affairs here, and fix upon a ruler at once, so that order may be restored. He suggested (between himself and me) Abdul Aziz, who, he said? was sure to make over any tract of country, such as Gwadur? to Govern ment, if required to do so. Engaged throughout the day in filling Agency windows and doors? on the west side, with sandbags - Lower storey completed at 2/45 P.M. In the morning, 2 British subjects complained to K clerk of their godowns having been broken into by Beni Boo Ali during is the night. It^not however known what has been taken out. At 4/l5.P.M. - Went over to Lawrence, to suggest that Brambler (r^J watch the pass (Moghib) with a search light during the night. Eventually, we went ourselves, and found but two badans in the Sultan’s Khor. Saw Suleiman, who would not or could not say how many badans had gone to Soor with loot. Saw Abdurrahman bin Eesa? who also could give no information on the subject. He took a message to the Sultan, requesting that 10 or 12 men under a responsible person, be placed at the corner of Seyyid Yusuf’s house, to stop any property being brought to the Musjid during the night. H.clerk says nothing more to loot in this quarter; doubtful I should think.He broup^it a message from His Highness, to the effect that it was wrong of Shaikh Saleh to collect loothe had received from his people in the Sultan f s palace, for if His Highness assaulted and retook the palace it would be said that his people had damaged the property* This is a trivial matter? but we said we would consider it* '^ook Resident as far as Customs house, which we found shut and barricaded more securely than beforeJ this effectually silences the Sultan^ complaints of the enemy having raised one of their barriers* Wednesday 6th March 8.A.M* - There was a panic this morning,(all the boats? about 70, rushing off from the shore) caused.by Banyas hearing a shot from Seyvid Fahad f s house. There had been fir ing since 7.P.M.yesterday, off and on. Both sides complained of breach of truce. Expect it originated in firing from the.- Sultan's side last; cannot ascertain truth* Agency full of Banyas, who complained of disorder amongst rebels, of threats, demand for money, and refusal to allow property to be removed, and even violence; but this last of mild nature* is Subedar reported Banyas told him cash in Treasury^talked of amongst bedouins on rebels' side. Probably got up by Banyas to enlist our sympathy on Sultan's side. Asked Pelly, with Resident's permission, to let search lights piy occasionally after midnight, and to land a party if any row heard at Agency. Met the Commander of Lawrence and returned with Resident. Letter from Saleh, complaining of the Sultan's people firing and breaking truce. Sent for Rashid bin Uzaiz, who said B a ieh*s statement required proof. Mutual complaints 'useless to try and investigate. Rashid was sent to Sultan, to ask whether His High ness would agree to another day's truce, also to give safe-conduct for two rebel Shaikhs to send two of their representatives. Lid not return. ^azier came Portly afterwards, saying the Sultan absolu tely declined to have another day's truce, as he had received(75) reinforcements, more were on their way, and he hopeduto be .able to take a resolute offensive* Told that it rested with Sultan to incur further responaibilijty if further there tfiould be, of declining another day’s truce to remove British property, and asked how about property still remaining in the town* Says it is under our protDCtion. This view was absolutely repudiated, it being clearly intimated that Sultan’s respon sibility will be increased (if increase be possible in an abstract quantity) by any action he may take to decline to secure British property* i hazier acknowledged all this, and suggested we should address Sultan in writing* No time and useless, as Sultan had said through Vizier he would not have another day’s truce under any circumstances. Vazier also said, Sultan would have nothing to do with rebels’ representatives. This in refernce to request made to Sultan through Rashid an hour (l0/30#a.m.) before, for safeconduct to procure their attendance. Vazier dismissed with intimation that present and urgent matter is to re-establish confidence in truce, and enable removal of rest of British subjects’ property to be continued, and meeting of representatives was primarily in view of that. Told that if at meeting extension of truce was positively refused on Sultan’s side, it would strengthen his position. 3.P.M. - Mohsin bin Aamir and Hamood bin Saron came from rebels under safe-conduct of Hamood bin Nasir, who was present at interview, except just at last. Two former being asked about violence and threats to our British subjects, and prevention of removal of property, gave vague and evasive answers to this and many questions. Finally being rather strongly warned about mistaking our moder ation, and that responsibility would be strongly enforced; that they were still injuring British property, and were thus(76) in opposition to Government and. told to convey this to Saleh; said that thoy would depart if told to do so. But afterwards •aid this was only polite form of speech - that they would go if show of force was made, Warned especially about remaining property in town, ( made 7C from Residents notes ) Interview recorded above with Mohsin bin Aamir and Hamood bin Saron; How about threatSr. violence and obstruction by rebels? Done by some ignorant people - any one brought to leaders 1 notice rectified, 'esult that Banyas could not remove further property today? Every time British subjects came to us with complaints, we gave them several men to help them ? and used stripes freely on our people. Evident that followers out of hand? We had a lot of ignorant people whose cupidity was excited by seeing property going off. By what right did you bring a lot of ignorant people to plunder a town. Brought them to fight,, not to plunder. But they do plunder f All whom we found plundering we stopped. In the rest it depends on your will. We hold ourselves responsible for all property looted.

' n hese two Shaikhs were also warned by me. (l) ^hat if they made a demonstration against Matrah, they * ,/ must respect Jayakar*s house and adjoining British houses and the Khoja fort. ( ) ^hat no firing is to take place from palace and Fahad*s house on to the harbour, and specially along the sea-shore in front of the Agency. They at once agreed to this, and asked the Sultan»s people be not allowed to fire at them from Rut- tonseets house and close to fore-shore. Hamood bin Nasir was taken out to the Brambler, shown the shells, and desired to arrange this. On Sultan’s side , 60 of and 100 from Twi, came in. ,p hen were sent on to Matrah. Tammineh bin Hameyed witha Co. ection of Naseri Beni Kalban Beni Sharkiyeh - 4 to 500 said reached to have^Khabooreh; will probably be here tomorrow. m he Sultan is certainly taking a strong position in refusing „ an extension of the truce, and Mohsin bin Aamir did not seem so confident in his demeanour, as at the last visit. Thursday r th March. A Banya who arrived yesterday from Seeb, reports that the Muavil are occupied on the west side of Rastak,and the bedouins on the east, the Sultan having written to the bedouins to protect the town. The Muavil and bedouins are all Hinawis. The Haji reports that no reinforcements can now reach the Sul tan by land. The Banya also reported, that Mohsin bin Kais has left Rustak, and is now in Hajim near Musnaah. Haji reports, that on Thursday the French Vice-Consul sent to Abdul Aziz and brought him to his home. That yesterday morning, Abdul Aziz went up to the fort to see the Sultan between 7 and 8 a.m. Proceeded on board Lawrence, 9 A-m. Mails and telegrams received 11 A.M. Proceeded on shore to arrange for a cessation of hostilities in the town between 4 and 5 P.M., as I desired to have an inter view with Shaikh Saleh at the Customs house at 4.P.M. All preliminaries being arranged, I left Sphinx in one of their boats, with the Haji, and Putewalla carrying flag, at 4.P.M., a gun from Sphinx anouncing my departure. Arrived at Customs house, found Shaikh Saleh expected me at a house inside the town. Sent to summons him to barricades. Waited 10 minutes and then mounted over barricade and sat on chair about 10 yards from Customs house gate, it being clear that Saleh would not cross barricade. Shaikh Saleh then arrived. I told him he had kept me waiting 10 minutes. He said they were all bedouins, and asked to be excused, as they knew nothing about ceremonies. I then communicated to him, through Haji Derwesh, in the pre sence of his^son Abdullah, Seyyid Hamood, Saood bin Azzan, and a crowd of followers whom I found it impossible to keep we back in the narrow street in which were seated, the orders of A Government which werej m*T 4Kf' •r n! M (l) That Zanzibar and Muscat were separate some 30 years ago, and that their union was now impossible.N»/ ( 79 ) (2) That British property must be respected, or else we should have to take active measures to protect it. I added on behalf of the Resident, that the position contem plated in (2) had practically arisen from their late acts in looting and impeding the removal of British property, on the 2nd and 3rd days of the truce. Shaikh Saleh said, that he could not deny that damage had been done to the property of our subjects by his followers, and said that damage had been done by the Sultan^ side also* I replied that I had met him with reference to matters from his side, and not with regard to the short-comings of the Sultan’s followers. He again said, he admitted his responsibility for all damage done by his people, promised full compensation, and asked, with refernce to property belonging to our subjects still left in the town, that it be all removed to a place of safety. To this I said; (1) That he was not a ruler, and that the kingdom was not in his hands, and that therefore, although his responsibility for.damage done by his followers was unquestionable, his mere acceptance of responsibility and promise of compensation could not be accepted as sufficient. (2) That the removal of the remaining property of British subjects was impossible for two reasons; (a) They had neither boats to remove, nor places to restore their property. w 1 (b) The actions of his followers, on the 2nd and 3rd days of the truce, had made it possible for us to allow our subjects, with due regard to their safety and actual removal of pro perty, to venture into the town again amongst his followers. Understanding that Shaikh Saleh had nothing further to say with regard to the object of mission, but that he admitted the short-comings of his followers, and accepted responsibilitytherefore, ( which I had said was not considered sufficient) I repeated to him personally the orders of Government, to ensure that he thoroughly understood them* When X came to the subject of Zanzibar, he motioned to the Haji not to repeat this; but I repeated it myself in a suf ficiently loud tone to be heard by all surrounding us, know ing that Saleh was keeping a large nutober of his following here on the hopes of the arrival of the Sultan of Zanzibar, or at leastjof assistance from him. (On the way back,, the ^aji explained this fact to me, also the reason why Saleh did not want his followers to hear that Muscat and Zanzibar would not be united, all of which I knew.) I the said good-bye to Shaikh Saleh and the other leaders and returned to the Sphinx* ha principal Shaikh of the Beni Boo Hassan was behind one of the barricades and salaamed to me - a fair looking man. Rost of afternoon and evening taken up with Resident, in con nection with telegram and report to Government, on situa-. tion during the week. About 2. P.M. Abdurrahman bin Eesa came on board Lawrence, with letters from Sultan asking for assistance against rebels. Sent him back with salaams, and message to say his letters had been received and would be shortly answered. A good deal of firing in the morning; no advance on either side. Sultan said to* have lost 4 men at Kulbooh. Yesterday we knew that Rashid met the rebels on behalf of the Sultan, after which Mohsin told us Sultan-had suggested * peace, which rebels had refused. He is now asking for our assistance, on the 2&lt;3.rd day; looks as if Mohsin*s story were true, and that the Sultan had no hopes of turning rebels out by means of his numerous followers. Friday bth March. - Resident despatched telegram to Foreign Office, by Lawrence which left at midday.(81) About 10/30 - It was reported that the Sultan's troops had mean evacuated the heights above Mukelleh, As this would probably^ their occupation by the rebels, and firing thence on the fort, I went to Mukelleh and advised the Banyas to clear out to Matrah, Later on, the principal ones came and represented that the alarm was false, and that they would prefer to remain at / Mukallah where they were comfortable and thought themselves safe, to anchoring in their bagglas in the more exposed road stead of Matrah* As further troops had been sent in the meanwhile, to the heights, I said they might remain for the present where they were, but that all their belongings must be kept on the shipping, and they must be ready to remove to Matrah should occasion require it. On returning to the Agency with Ool Wilson s after departure of Lawrence, found the Choudreyts godowns had been broken into, either last night or the night before* Hearing some loot had been taken into a shed close to the Agency, sent for ftashid bin Uzaiz, and had that place and Musjid searched; a few bales of rice and wheat were recovered. The thieves were said to be the people from Semmiyal. He sent a message to Sultan, desiring that a party of from 20 to 30 men be located every night, with one of his Walis, close to ^eyyid^fusuf , s house, to stop any plunder being brought to the Musjid. It was also intimated to His Highness, through Rashid bin Uzaiz, that if His Highness did not stop this pilfering and removal of goods, we should have to take steps to do so ourselves, which might be prejudicial to His Highness 1 s interests in the present state of affairs. Rashid told us about his interview with Shaikh Saleh; both of them seemed to agree that the present position had lasted long enough, but Shaikh Saleh said he had no confidence in the r ■(82) Sultan nor the Sultan in the Hinawis. and. that he refused to mediate except through the medium of the Agency. It seems from Rashid f s account, that Saleh knows he has sinned deeply against the Sultan this time, and fears )a subsequent expedition against him. This seems doubtful. Saleh f s terms, if he treats, would probably be;- (1) That bygones be bygones. (2) A cash payment of 10,000 dollars. Three of the Hijrieen were with the Sultan today/ bent on peace overtures, the idea being that the Sultan should pay them to go, and thus reduce Saleh f s following by about 400 men. This tribe has been always fairly well disposed to the Sultan. The chief Shaikh is Badar bin Mahomed. Rashid told me that Feysul bin Hamood was still at and that Mohsin bin Kais had not left Rustak. 5.P.M. - Replied to Sultan^ letters asking for active aid. Saturday 9th 8.A.M. - Heard that there was a truce between the parties, with a view to peace negotiations. 12.P.M. - Sent Haji to Shaikh Saleh to get hold of Rashid’s letter, in which mention of the French had been made. Saleh told Haji the letter had been left at Rui and he did not know whether it existed or not. Said the French were not speci fically mentioned, only aihint given about certain proceedings in the north of Africa. I must question whether there is anything in this throat of playing off the French on the rebels. About 5/30 P.M. - Abdurrahman bin Besa came on board Sphinx, and told us that peace negotiations were proceeding. He said the Sultan had waited till 1 then before sending us a messaged as he hoped they would have been concluded by this time, and he would have liked to let us know that security was restored. bin Eesa 7.P.M. - Abdurrahman came with a message from His Highness to say peace had been concluded, and that the rebels would leavethis night. The Sultan would show red lights on both forts as soon as they had gone and he wished British subjects to re** turn to their homes with the dawn. I demurred to this, and said I would be up myself at daylight, and see how matters stood. Abdurrahman bin Eesa told us the Sultan had arranged that none of his allies were to advance or proceed further in the town until he had come down, and the British subjects were back in their homes. I replied that this was a wise precaution, and trusted it would be carried out. Sunday 10th March. Haji came to me at 6 A.M. and said the whole place was being looted by the Sultan f s people and Baloochis. Went with him round the streets and bazaars; nearly all the shops and houses were gutted, and what had not been carried away had been broken, ^’he pillage and wanton destruction had been com plete. Looting of very serious description and the Sultan’s men trying to restore order. Before the rebels left., they set fire to the town in 3 directions; (a) The Parsee’s shop which was burnt out and standing alone; there was little fear of the fire spreading. the (b) At the North-west corner of big bazaar; this was more dangerous. Several houses had been burnt, and the owners of the surrounding houses were engaged in knocking down walls to prevent the fire spreading. ,1 he fire then seemed \,o be smouldering in the ruins. (c) By the small gate similar to (b). I twice visited the scene during the day. Seyyid Mahomed busied himself in getting men to convey water, and the fire engine was sent from Mukallah. But such was the confusion that it was difficult to get anyone to give orders, or find any to obey them. 7.A.M. - Went up to the fort and besought the Sultan oo come( 84 ) down and do something to restore order. I told him the rebels had sacked and burnt the town, before leaving, in the night, \ * / ■ and that his allies had since completed the rest of destruction, for He appeared to fear leaving the fort. Asked me 2 Bugglas, at A present with British subjects. Said I would do what I could to help him to get rid of his very doubtful allies, especially the Soor people, but found on my return that the 2. bugglas were full of British subjects* property for which there was no other place of storage, I'ried to see if any steamer arrived during night would take off Soor people on payment, but commander declined, &amp;aji wrote to Vazier, suggesting that all bugglas and badans in Matrah should be brought round to Muscat, and the Soor people sent oft in them. Went round the bazaar again with Colonel Wilson, Vazier tells me that the Beni Boo Ali, Shaikh Abdullah bin Salim, had been much with the French Vice-Consxil of late, evidently try ing to shield the tribe under him. Monsieur Ottavi came over in the faternoon, the first time since Wednesday, About 12 0*clock, wrote to Sultan urging energetic measures to be taken to save the little property left in the town, Sultan came down from the fort about 10 A,M, and returned about midday. At 3,P,M, he came down again, and we found him in the evening watching operations for extinguishing the fire. Rashid bin Uzaiz(aslo there) told us the Beni Boo Ali, Hishm were to be removed outside the city tomorrow morning, and would be sent off to Soor as soon as bagglas could be got. 'Ihe Beni Jabir and others had been sent to Matrah in the morning: Doth .vith a view to got tuem out of Muscat, and to strengthen Matrah in case of a surprise by Saleh’s people who had halted at Rui. In the evening the whole town seemed as a town of the dead almost utterly deserted.Besides the fires mentioned above, a Banyans shop was set on fire by the rebels, Jayakar tells me this Banya had promised rebels 150 dollars for safe custody of his shop, but had given an assumed name. On leaving, not being able to find the man whose name he gave, they looted the shop and set fire to it. Most of the Banyas remain the night at Mukaliah. Monday 11th March. - Attempts at restoring order being strongly made by Local Government. The Sultan came down from the fort in the morning. Went round the town in the morning and again in the evening. The big fire was still smouldering in the places, but all fear of further conflagration ended. A gun was heard, from the direction of Bait al Falaj, in the morning, which was thought to be signal that Sultan , B men had all left. Rashid bin Uzaiz went to Bait al Falaj and reported rebels all left. Banyas engaged in clearing up their shops and houses, but property remains at Mukallah till the Beni Boo Ali have been cleared out. Megji Banya reported Postmaster^ house full of rebels who would not leave because they had loot in it. Sent several messages to Local Government, and at last house cleared by the evening. Unlicensed loot being // upon, but Sultan too weak to risk encounter with Beni Boo Ali. Sultan hopes to clear this tribe out to Sidab tomorrow, but fears this will not be done for a day or two yet. Suleiman Jamadar of Julali, searched one of the Beni Boo Ali on foreshore, to great indignation of Shaikh Abdullah bin Salim. The heavy bag carried by the man was shewn to contain lead. Tuesday 12th March 8/30 A.M. - Went round all the palaces and town with Colonel Wilson. Top of palaces and Seyyid Fahad^ house must have been untenable by rebels-Town being cleared up and B an yas putting their houses in order. Damoder says fires were lighted in every part of the Mils j id by one of the first to warn Sultan on evening of the 12th February. Also - Saleh the Hydrami Commander of the Rawajab' power. Cates now held by Wahabis - a serviceable-looking set of men. Eaji says Ruttonsee bought 40 bags of his rice from Beni Bob Ali for 1 dollar per bag. Bab Kabir, too, must have been untenable in any numbers, as shots from Mirani could reach it. Two Banyas complained of their godowns being broken into at Matrah, suspected His Highness^ troops. Communication to Sultan through -^aji. His Highness had sent orders in the matter to his Wali and would clear his troops out of the town. Wednesday 13th March 9 A.M. - Resident and Political Agent paidi a vi6it to the Sultan in the fort. Memo made of interview. ^oats not yet collected to take off Beni Boo Ali. No further depradations reported. French man-of-war w Troude ,r arrived at 9/l5 a.m. H.M. S. ^rambler 11 returned from Jask shortly afterwards. No telegrams. Commandant of Troude called at 4/l5 P.M. Guard was turned out on his arrival and departure. He had left Toulon on the 13th ultimo for Obok, whence he came on here. Sultan, in fort Julali, at 9,A.M. this morning, and were received by His Highness at the second gate of the fort. The Resident offered his congratulations to His Highness on the departure of his enemies, hoped no new trouble would arise, and that the difficulties which the outbreak had occasioned to His Highness would soon be surmounted. To this His Highness rebels. Saw bin Abdullah who commands 150 Wahabis, CONFIDENTIAL memo. 'he Resident and Political Agent paid a visit to His Highness the expressed his thanks, with a hope that it might be so(87) After some ordinary conversation the Resident told His Highness that he must be aware that worse damage h?*d been done to the property of British subjects in the town* and that though the Resident was not aware what view Government world take of this matter, he thought Government would doubtless be glad to know what His Highnesses own views would be regarding the exacting of reparation and the manner in which this should be effected. His Highness at first said that this could be done in any way Government thought fit. Pressed further, His Highness said the offending tribes should be made to pay, and that he would take the necessary steps against them if Government should assist him. As regards the question as to how this was to be effected, he said, against their property, implying that action could be taken against their export trade. With regard to this** it was pointed out to His Highness, that Government would probably not consider a more money reparation for pro perty looted and destroyed as sufficient,' and that the matter could not be looked upon in the light of an ordinary business looted transaction, so much property so much paid back in return; vN. that the tribe by coming to Muscat and laying violent hands on our property, had implicated themselves deeply with the British Government, and that the exaction of a heavy fine on this account might be necessary. His Highness replied generally that this might be so. His Highness asked us privately what view Government would take if an application were made from him for a loan to meet his present difficulties. To this it was replied, that no answer could be given to such a question, as it was a matter entirely for the consideration of Government, but that it was obvious that before Government would consider tho matter, it would want to be fully informed, not only as to what had occurred,^ - but what guarantee there was for future peace and security in Muscat, and what steps the Sultan had taken and would be(88) prepared to take, to ensure this end* His Highness insisted that the outbreak was incited from Zanzibar, but beyond the fac\,s that have already formed the subject of correspondence and were connected with the visits of the Harth to Zanzibar, His Highness had no further direct, evidence to show the connection of the Sultan of Zanzibar with the rising* He thought aid had again been given in money and promises to the rebel chiefs, but had no certain information to go on* He particularly dealt on the visits of the Harth to Zanzibar, the presents they had received, and the fact that Mohsin bin Aamir is brother to the Vakil who transacts business between Hamad bin Thuweyni and the British Government* His Highness referred more than once to our not having given him assistance against the rebels* To this it was pointed out, that he had not asked for our assistance till the 11th hour. His Highness said that a little help on our part would have been of great assistance to him in discouraging the pretensions of the rebels, who had been encouraged by the very fact of our non-in tervention for so long, and he was disposed to argue with ref erence to damage done to British property, that we had acquiesced in this damage by our non-intervention, or at least had en couraged the idea that money payments would fully meet all their liabilities to us. He even seemed inclined to hold that we were responsible ourselves for the protection of our property in Muscat, and pointed out that on previous occasions, when Muscat had been threatened, the rebels had been driven back by a few shells from our men-of-war, and even by a word from us alone. To this the Resident replied, that the responsibility for the protection of British property in Muscat rested entirely on the ruler, as it does all over the world, and that we could not in any way assume responsibility for its protection. That the normal policy of Government was one of non-interference in internal affairs of Oman. That the late disaster was one(89) unparalled in the history of the country, both as/regards the amount of mischief done, and the period of its duration, and it was pointed out that this crisis could never have occurred had the Local Government used due fore-sight and precaution; that he was the ruler of the country and not we, and that we had no voice in the relations he chose t»o exercise with the tribes under this rule: that were we responsible for the safety of Muscat, we should have taken steps which would have rendered such a surprise and coup, as that effected by the rebels, out of the question. With regard to the damage done to our property, so far from acquiescing in the acts of ^he rebels, they were more than once strongly warned uhat, their responsibility for compensation would not be taken as suffi cient, and we expressed our surprise to His Highness at his putting such a idea forward. It was further said that a! wo had taken action on our own behalf to expel the rebels, in uho interests of our own property, that property would have suffered as much at the hands of his followers as it did at the hands of the rebels. Withe regard to the Beni Boo Ali and their failing to make a resolute attack on the rebels. His Highness told us that Lhoy could not attack the strong position hold by cho enemy, but that ho was undor deep obligations to them for the way they had answered his summons for assistance, and he practically meant that they had saved the Sultanate by preventing a further advance by Saleh’s people. On its being pointed out that they had done damage to British property. His Highness did not attempt to deny this, but said he hoped to recover all the property they had taken. His Highness had nothing further to state at present with regard to any measures ho proposed to adopt with a view t*o communica- tion to Government, nor did His Highness show any sign of acquainting us authoritatively with the terms of the truce hohad offoctod with tho rebels Muscat, 13/3/95. Saturday 16th March. - At ll/30 called on Commander of French man-of-war !f Tro\ido’ f with tho Resident; a salute of 13 guns was fired on Resident’s departure. About l.P.M. - Virji came and complained that one of his godowns had been broken into byvtho Beni Boo Ali or Baloochis. Sent him to tho Sultan, with again a message to say that tho prosonco of tho tribe was a menace to tho town, and asking when they were going. Sultan replied, as soon as two buglas wore cleared. Hurried on tho Banyas to remove their goods on to one of Virji’s buglas. Seyyid Mahomed bin Hilal’s house was occupied by about 30 of tho Beni Boo Ali, who levied Blackmail and refused to t'jrn out. Sultan eventually came and turned them out. Dhamoder has orders for final payment of money to the Beni Boo Ali, Hishmr, and Beni Rasib and went off at l/30 to give them their money. Head clerk tells mo, that it is supposed Shaikh Abdullah bin Salim will stay on for some time, sending the rest of tho men away. Also the general opinion in town that Sultan will not be able to hold Muscat without our help. Ramzan tells me, that he hoars from a friend of his, that Shaikh Abdullah bin Salim was at the French Vice-Consulate the day the w Troude ,f arrived, and not since. Sunday 17th March. - A Banya came and reported that Kurriyat had been looted by Kurta and about 25 to..30 men 9 days ago. They only stayed an hour, and looted the whole bazaar. Some 15 days before this, Kurta had tried to get at the bazaar and failed. This time ho appeared suddenly. There are two Banyas at Kurriyat - brothers - they put down their (Sd) J.Hayes Sadler. Political Agent.(91) joint loss at about 1000 dollars. Saturday 16th March. - Ghopalji Valji tolls mo that tho day boforo yesterday* in tho afternoon* R-attonsoe, after leaving- Mr Mackirdyis house* passed through his office and sat down and talked. Ruttonseets man came and called him, and said someone was waiting for him. Rxittonsee got up and said ,f Perhaps it may be Abdullah bin Salim ,T Ghopal asked him what business this Shaikh could have and why he was waiting. Ruttonsee then said n I think he wants to be a French subject 1 ' Ruttonsee then went off, havirig told Ghopal that the French Commander and Vice-Consul had been that day to his house. Ghopal says that Ruttonsoe is often going to the French Consulate; that is what ho hears. Has seen him once or twice lately. Does not know whether Abdullah bin Salim goes there or not. When Ruttonsee left Ghopal's house, latter thought d,hat per haps Ruttonsoe would take Abdullah bin Salim to the French Vice-Consulate and interpret between them, but this is not what struck him at the time. Ruttonsoe further told Ghopal that he had to lot his house to the French Vice-Consul, and that the latter would fly a French Flag over his house when ». a ^ French man-of-war arrived. Yester day, Ruttonsee showed the Banyas a card given him by the Com mander of the French man-of-war, permitting them to see the vessel. Virji Ruttonsee asked Ghopal to go with him to see the vessel. The latter said it was not good to go at such a time. After this the Banyas did not go. Ghopal thinks that this has come to the ears of the Sultan, while Dhamoder was up in the fort, heard some mention of tho French vessel, at a long private interview Shaikh Abdullah had with the Sultan, and he thinks tho Sultan has forbidden Abdullah from going to the French Vice-Consulate. Ghopalthinks Sultan quite disapproves of these pretensions on part of Beni Boo Ali, etc,, as since those disturbances he has heard the Sultan call them rascals for flying French Flags, saying ho was powerless to do anything against them, Ghopal says all the Merchants are crying out against Ruttonsoe, who they say has purchased over 300 bags of rice from the bedouins, having his (Ghopal f s) marks, and that ho only had 60 bags of rice and no wheat in the godowns, previous to the com- moncoment of the disturbances. Rice he had with his own marks, \ and sold thisto merchants, and now claims all bags bearing his marker as his own, (Sd) cf.H.S. 16/3/95. Monday 18th 7,A,M, - Saw about 40 of the Beni Boo Ali on the beach, with about 30 bags, apparently rice and loot, preparing to embark on a badan. Also another badan apparently full. Sent a message to Sultan, drawing his attention to the matter? and asking what steps ho proposed to take, vamzan came with message to say His Highness would send me an immediate reply. Went over and saw Sultan, and showed him from window of palace what was going on. He had sent his Vazier to fetch Abdullah bin Salim, On my insisting that these proceedings must be stopped, he said he could not come down on the Beni Boo Ali for taking off rice, as he had given them a great deal which they had stored up. To a this I replied, that it was notorious fact, which had been often brought to his notice, that the Beni Boo Ali had looted godowns and that there was just as much (if not some) probability that it was our rice they were taking off; besides, I said this question could be easily set at rest by seeing how many bags His Highness had given these people from first to last. On this point His Highness could give me no idea, except that he hadgiven them large quantities. I told His Highness that these people were thieves* and should be searched before they were allowed to embark, I asked if this would cause a commotion and be likely to lead to further trouble in the town, as the Beni Boo Ali were numerous and His Highness had all along hesitated to coerce them. His Highness said he did not know, that he had sent for Abdullah bin Salim, and would have the badans searched, and that they would not be allowed to depart till this had been done. I asked His Highness if, in the event of his failing to effect a search, he would wish for our assistance. His Highness hesitated for some time, and then said he would send me a reply to this question later. He referred again to the object of rice, and said it would be impossible to tell from marks whether the bags had been stolen or not, as he had himself purchased quantities for the Beni Boo Ali, from our people. Also he said, that he had caused the Beni Boo Ali to return all the rice stolen from the Banyas. I referred to the conversation we had with His Highness in the fort, and asked with reference to exacting compensation from the offending tribes, whether His Highness included among them the Beni Boo Ali and others of his allies. His Highness replied ,f AS the Surkar sees fit ,f . His Highness promised to send his Yazier over to me as soon as he had taken steps. The Vazier came about 8/30, with one of His Highness f s writers and two Beni Boo Ali Shaikhs, Mahomed bin Kalfan and Khamis bin Mahomed. I spoke very strongly to these Shaikhs, and asked them what they meant by looting our godowns. They said there were many tribes here, and practically admitted that plundering had been done by their followers ( whom they said they couldpot control) as well as by the other tribes.I reminded them of what had happened to them when they fell fOTil of the British Government 60 years ago: and warned them that actions of this kind would not be allowed to pass un noticed. The Vazier told me that the French Vice-Consul had, during the disturbances, claimed protection for Abdul Aziz which the Sultan refiised. The badan that was loaded came round to the Moghib, and all its contents were taken out on the beach and examined by Shaikh Rashid and a committee of leading Banyas, Only a cushion was found belonging to their small temple. I did not expect much results from the actual searching, but today f s action will have a very good effect, for now that the tribesmen knew their bags will be searched, they will not try to take off stolen property. The Banyas say it would be impossible to get any proof with regard to rice bags, and Dhamoder tells me the Sultan used to give out 100 bags of rice per diem as pay and rations. This would account for a great deal of rice we have seen on the badans. The committee also told me, that the accounts which have reached me regarding the Beni Boo Ali and others having sent off boats full of stolen property to Soor, are greatly exaggerated, for they say but little damage has been done on this side of the town. Perhaps 5 boats have gone off with copper pots, house hold things, and some rice, but not in the wholesale way in which reports had reached me. Wrote to the Sultan to have a strong party posted at Seyyid Jowawi f s house to search suspicious-looking bundles, and sug gested the arrangements bo placed in Shaikh Rashid f s hands. Also that a Shaikh of each tribe be present to stop any commotion, ho again made use of the expressions ,r It behooves Government to look into the matter’ 1 , refering to the recent disturbances.21st March. - His Highness called on the Resident. The Resident left in the Lawrence at 5/l5 P.M. A salute being fired from His Highness f s batteries. His Highness also told me that Ruttonsee and other Banyas had sold rice to the rebels during the 2nd truce and received in payment hoondis on Zanzibar; His Highness had heard this but had no proof. He said he would let me know further when he had obtained proof.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00025d_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/6/37</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00025d</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/6/37</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>‘File XXVIII/2 INTERNAL POLITICS &amp; RELATIONS WITH OMAN MAJOR SADLER'S DIARY DURING REBELLION OF 1895.’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1895/1895</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-05-05T13:39:29</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (50 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 52; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains a diary written by the Political Agent at Muscat, Major James Hayes Sadler.
