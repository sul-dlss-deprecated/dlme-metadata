Copies of the outgoing responses from the Government of India Foreign and Political- and External Affairs Departments are also found within the file. There is a small amount of correspondence dated 1940, conducted between the Government of India and the War Office, regarding further requests for ammunition; these were denied due to a change in Government policy on the export of arms and ammunition.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the end of the correspondence (folio 1).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>War Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Portuguese India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Nova Goa</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Export controls</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002d9#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002d9#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
