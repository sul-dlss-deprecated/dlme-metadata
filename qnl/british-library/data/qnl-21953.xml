(2) It will he necessary for ships sailing from a neutral port to any of the above countries to obtain: (ij Navicert for all items of cargo (2) a ship’s Navicert from British Consul at last port of loading. 1 (3^ The ship’s Navicert will not he a separate document hut an endorsement on the ship’s manifest in the following terms: 'It is hereby certified that all (give number) items of cargo on this manifest have been passed for export. Date, name, description.' (4) Ships sailing in ballast will require a ship’s Navicert in above form endorsed with words 'ballast'. 1 (5) Any ship which has not obtained a shin’s Navicert will be liable to seizure. (6) At present a ship’s Navicert is not issued for a ship carrying passengers or mail. Some modification to this will he necessary and we propose that in these cases a ship’s Navicert should be issued: (1) if passenger list has been submitted and approved by local British Consul in advance; and (2) if arrangements have beer made with local government or shipping company concerned which will enable us to exercise censorship of mails where facilities are available. In practice, they cannot (i ch.) issue a ship’s Navicert in certain cases where censorship arrangements are not practicable. (7) We suggest for their own protection that ships sailing from any Empire port direct to any of above destinations should be given a ship’s Navicert by the competent local authorities, provided of course that the cargo is covered by export licences or by Navicerts in case of goods previously loaded in neutral countries. (8&gt; Existing arrangements regarding the refusal of export licences for certain of specified (2 ch.) destinations should remain unchanged. 1 (9) In cases where ships sailing from any Empire port intend to call at any intermediate British or neutral ports, the ship’s I Navicert should be given by the appropriate officer at the' last Jport of call, It will facilitate his task if the Master of the | ship could be given a document at each port of loading contraband H that goods loaded at that port are approved. | (10) Where a ship which should have obtained a shin’s Navicert | has cleared without doing so, the fact should be reported by tele- I gram immediately to London and also to the local Naval authority. iiii,Miii&lt;iiiiniiw&gt;m&gt;i&lt;uTrii'iii*«iH'T‘' :, 'i’* ? *^'” a&gt; Th'' - Tm—n-fT'rir r—COPY Note No. 347 dated 30th July 1940. Prom His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran; To the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Tehran. On instructions from His Majesty’s Principal Secretary for Foreign Affairs, I have the honour to “bring the following inform ation to Your Excellency’s notice and to request that it may “be conveyed to the appropriate authorities in Iran. 2. Presence of German troops on the Spanish frontier and German occupation of the West coast of Europe from Norway to the South of France necessitate changes in the form of contraband control. It is no longer enough to examine ships entering the Mediterranean or North Sea, It is necessary to control all shipping approaching Europe. 3. Under the present system of contraband control this would mean that ships would often have to be intercepted and diverted for examination to control bases far out of their course. Although it would be within the rights of His Majesty’s Government as belliger ents to do xx this, they wish to avoid it if possible and have therefore decided to make general use of Navicerts for inward ships and cargo and of Certificates of Origin for outward ships and cargp 4. Under the Navicert system exporters in foreign countries intending to ship goods throiigh contraband controls submit their shipments for consideration in advance and in proper cases obtain through His Majesty’s Consuls a Navicert or pass showing that they have been provisionally approved. Similarly', European exporters obtain a Document known as Certificate of Origin provisionally approving goods as not being of enemy origin or In which an enemy has an interest. 5. In addition to these facilities for examination of items of cargo. Masters of ships can if they comply with the requirements of the contraband control E in other respects, obtain a document knov/n as a ship’s Navicert from a British Consul certifying that the whole of their cargo is covered by Navicerts. In future ship’s Navicerts will also be available for outward bound ships carrying cargoes completely covered by Certificates of Origin. 6. These documents in so far as they may be required will be made generally available. As regards exports from British territ ory export licences will be equivalent, to Navicerts. 7. In future His Majesty’s Government will assume that shippers and shipowners will take advantage of arrangements which will save them much inconvenience, loss and delay. They will therefore regard as suspect any cargo not wholly covered by Navicerts or British export licences, consigned to any of the following countries:- Finland, Baltic States, Sweden, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, Spanish and International Morocco, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Greece, Bulgaria, Foumania, Turkey, European Russia, Spanish and Portug uese Atlantic Islands. Since Navicerts are not normally refused except where actual or potential enemy destination is suspect, any unnavicerted cargo for these destinations v/ill be liable to be seized as prize. Same will apply to any outward cargo not covered by Certificates of Origin. 8. In the same way inward bound ships sailing without ship’s Navicerts will be presumed to be doing so only because they were unable to obtain Navicerts for the whole of their cargo and there fore deliberately carrying contraband. Such ships will be similarly liable to seizure. Outward bound ships not provided with a ship’s Navicert will also be assumed to be carrying goods of enemy origin or interest and will be liable to seizure. 9. Accordingly His Majesty’s Government have decided to announce that all ships sailing to or from any of the above destinations whichwhich leave their last port of call/after 31st July 1940 without obtaining a ship’s Navicert, will, if intercepted by our patrols, be liable to be seized in prize* ‘During the initial period allowance will be made for cases where the shipowner has already loaded unnavicerted or uncertif icated cargo. I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that His M a J e 8ty s Consular Officers at Khorramshahr, Ahwaz, Bushire and Kerman have been Informed accordingly and to assure Your Excellency that they will do everything possible to assist the Iranian authorities in the application of these measures.

From...Secretary of State for India, London. To .....Governor General (Commerce Departmentsew Delhi. IMRaBliiL L.y'' Your telegram No.5072 December 22. Subject to final viev^s of His Majesty^ Representa tives at Baghdad and Teheran it is proposed shortly to announce extension to Iraq and Iran of (a) compulsory Navicert system for all sea Lome goods consigned to either country via Persian GulfT (b) compulsory certificate of origin system ona all goods loaded at Iraqi or Iranian Persian Gulf ports other than those on a published list of commodities. This list would contain commodities normally exported from I rap and Iren which are unlikely to xagx originate in present circumstances from enemy territory, (}oods on this list would not .require certificates of origin if th^y are of Iraqi or Iranian origin and contain no enemy interest. 2, following consequential points are under consideration: (a) whether exports from India and other arts of empire to Iran and Iraq should be subject to quantitative restric tions. If this is necessary in r espect of any commodities LOWS I presume that it eould be apolied to exports oyer Indo- ITinian land frontier and th&amp;t exports irom Irdif by qho\ are ef x “ made t - ^ w T and British Airways. Jn . Iran it would be undesirable to introduce-any severe restric tions against that country. (b) problem of transhipments or re-exports from protected Arab States or Muscat. In this connection I would be glad of views of Government of Indie on my telegram No.843 to Political Resident in the Persian Gulf which is being repeated to Department of External Affairs. ‘ IbJc (c) Ships without ship Navicerts could cost conveniently be diverted to Karachi for examination. Number of ships so divert d will depend on whether Japanese ships apply for ship Navicerts and if they refuse on what decision is taken how to d eal with such a situation. Possibility of an incident occuring at Karachi in connection with a Japanese ship is evident, I presume that you will satisfy yourselves that staffing arrangements at Karachi are adequate for such contingency. 3. I wpuld be glad of your views generally and particu larly on points mentioned in paragraph 2. Telegram XX No.1183 dated llth March 1941* From Governor General (Commerce Deptt)New Delhi. To ......

Lffipo.xta..k.IMPORTANT .y yq \ Your telegram No,866 of 26th January, to wiloome proposal to xal.reduce control over sea-borne goods consigned to or from Persian Gulf Ports and as part of that plan to establish an examination base at Karachi. We have, as you know* throughout. m en the view that such measures are essential, n the pOssibi- y is to be ensured against of goods originating in neutral, 1 countries and consigned to Persian Gulf Ports being re-exported or on-carried to enemy territories. 2. Pan graph 1 of your telegram. We would be rateful to have in tlue course a list of commodities which should be exempted from Certificate of Origin provisions 3, Our views on points raised in paragraph 2 of your tele gram are as follows: on exports from India tp.Ifran _ r „ A r r Bespept of (1) commodities whim tne two countries, and Iran in particular, are known to be supplying to the enemy and (2) commodities of much the enemy is in short supply, rood grains, tea, raw cotton, oil seeds and possibly hides fall in first category, decora cate gory includes non-ferrous metals and ores, raw rubo r, coffee, vegetable oils and possibly sugar. In some of these articles., nptably raw cotton and non-ferrous metals and ore?, there is xi little or no trade and question of quota restrictions appears to us to nrise in a practical f«r«m only in the case of raw hides. „ and skins, dyeing and tanning substances, food grains, vegetable oils and jute manufactures. If quotas are to bef fixed for these articles we consider that regard should be paid not merely For commodities not in in categories mentioned above such as cotton manufactures, cement iron or steel goods and )aper and stationery no quantitative limits should be fixed. On mainte nance oi unrestricted opportunities of trade expansion in such ’TOO 13 i ;r&amp;de :xist depend to a large extent success of the ^rejected drive in Iran and Iraq. We confirm presumption that any restrictions decided upon could be applied to exports accoss Indo-Iranian land frontier. Exports by dhows are already subject to licence, but following further steps have been taken to tighten control, firstly, customs authorities have been instructed to or anise special measures to prevent possible attempts at unauthoriesed shipment of controlled goods from places on the coast not declared as ports. Secondly, in order to guard against possibility oi diversion of goods en route, shippers are now being required to execute bond undertaking to produce within a specified period landing certifi cates from local authorities at port of discharge, Ks a further checn, it is proposed that reports of al 1 such shipmoxts should be ma e to the appropriate British authorities in the country or port of destination tp enable them to verify arrival of goods and to keep track of their subsequent movements, lantime States are being ? ske4 to co-operate by enforcing similar measures in their territories.

Persian Gulf Contraband ControlAt a meeting held in Delhi 'between the External Affairs Department and Commerce Department it ms observed that the 'bulk of the exports to the Arab littoral were commodities which were not on the prohibited list and that the total amounts, though subject to fluctuation, were fairly regular over a long period, and moderate in amount, 2. It was therefore decided to recommend to the Secretary of State that a licensing system should not be introduce! for the Arab littoral but that political Agents should be notified by mail of exports from India and that they would acknowledge their arrival and inform Government at once of any re-exports to suspicious destinations or any unusual development. This would of course only continue as long as these states co-operated, and it would be explained to their rulers that it was a special concession and that the navicert and quota system would be applied to them if the arrangement proved unworkable through any fault of their administration. 3. I explained frankly to Commerce Department that these states had a small smuggling trade with Persia, that this did not include any articles likely to help the enemy and that in return they receive certain foodstuffs which they would find difficulty in getting elsewhere.

Persian Gulf Contraband J x Control fR( Received under Tehran Circular ^avinp; No. 8 dated the 15th February 19417 1 Tel egram. From His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, London, To His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 49 Arfar. /5th. Dated 4tl^February 1941. Subject to your final views I propose shortly to announce the extension to Iraq and Iran of (a) compulsory navicert system for all sea-borne goods consigned to either country via the Mediterranean or Persian Gulf and (b) certificates of origin and interest system which will be limited in scope but which where applicable will also be compulsory. My immediately following telegram contains lists of commodities normally exported from Iraq or Iran which in present circumstances are unlikely to originate in enemy territory. Goods on this list provided they are of Iraqi or Iranian origin and contain no enemy interest Y/ill not be required to be covered by certificates of origin and interest (though in proper cases certificates will be issued on exporter’s request); all other goods loaded in Iraqi and Iranian ports in the Persian Gulf will be required to be so covered. 2. This method of operating the certificate of origin and interest system hitherto untried is designed to give us desired control of enemy exports without throwing unnecessary v/ork on consular officers. Moreover it should avoid dislocation of trade referred to in ♦ your telegram No. 78 since only a small percentage of the total exports from Iraqi and Iranian ports will yG* /require -n Not reed. % / 2 . require certificates. Its only serious defects are that it provides no certain means of preventing (i) Syrian- Turkish goods belonging to one of the listed categories from being exported without certificates under the pretence that they are Iraqi or Iranian and (2) exports of listed goods which the enemy has purchased with a view of acquiring foreign exchange on re-sale overseas. However shipowners should be warned that the fact that goods are on the list is no guarantee that they will not be placed in prize if it should transpire that that they are not of local origin or that they contain an enemy interest. 3. Contemporaneously with the extension of the navicert and certificate of origin and interest systems as above outlined I propose to make the navicert system available on a voluntary basis for goods consigned to Saudi Arabia (see my telegram No. 6 to Jedda). Further extension of the certificate of origin and interest system is at present unnecessary. 4. Muscat, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Trucial Sheikh doms will be excluded from the navicert system provided they adopt satisfactory export licencing systems. India Office have telegraphed in this connexion to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf* ^ V | 3. All ships including (unless you see any objection) dhows and other coasting vessels trading in or into the Gulf will require to carry ship»s navicerts. If they fail to do so ship and offending items of cargo will be liable to be dealt with in the manner indicated in * paragraphs 6 and 7 of my telegram No. 45 Circular. To qualify for ship’s navicerts the following requirements must be fulfilled: a) inward-bound ships 1}) all cargo /for3 .r \ \ ^ e ¥ for the Gulf area other than that for destinations mentioned in paragraph 4 (assuming that satisfactory- export licencing systems are established) must be covered by Navicerts or export licences from. British or Allied territories. £) if ship carries mails the Master must give an undertaking to drop mails for examination at a designated censorship port. 3) list of passengers embarking at neutral ports must be submitted to and approver by the local British Consul, b) outward bound ships 1) all cargo loaded in Iraqi or Iranian ports other than goods specified in the published list must be covered by certificates of origin and interest. 2) and 3) as above. 6. Following are suggested designated censorship stations: a} for ships sailing round the Cape, Cape Town, b) ships to or from East Africa or Madagascar or Reunion if possible Bombay otherwise Mombassa or Karachi, (at present our policy is to prevent all ships calling at Madagascar and Reunion), c) for ships to or from the Atlantic seaboard of the Americas it might be possible to arrange a call at Bermuda or Trinidad providing there was no intervening neutral call between the Persian Gulf and these stations. 7. Form of ship’s navicert for inward-bound shins will be as set out in paragraph 3 of my telegram No.42 Circular. For outward-bound ships it will be in the following form: ft It is hereby certified that all items of blanks (giving vessel’s description and name) cargo loaded in Iraqi or Iranian ports are covered by certificates of origin and interest or are approved for export on the /understanding4 understanding that they are of Iraqi or Iranian origin and contain no enemy interest. Date, name, description. 8* Ship’s navicerts for inward-bound ships will normally be issued at the last port of call before entering the Gulf of Oman and for outward-bound ships at the last port of call in Iraq or Iran as the case may be. In the latter connexion I foresee some difficulty as regards ports where we have no consul or other officer who could undertake the task of issuing necessary documents. Faced with a similar problem in Portuguese African colonies I arranged that at consular ports the Consul should approve 1) cargo loaded at that port and 2) cargo loaded at any non-consular ports at which ship has called since previous consular port. If this system is adopted Consul will issue ship’s navicerts vali^d only to the next port of call (whether a consular port or not) and the form of words suggested in the preceding paragraph will require some amendment. It will be necessary to indicate that ship has been authorized to call subsequently at certain named (non-consular) ports on the understanding that she will call finally at a British empire or consular port. Please let me have your views on this proposal with particular reference to Bandar Shahpur, 9* By way of simplification of the certificate of origin and interest system laid down in enclosure to my i. e. App.4 of War Instns. L Circular despatch No. E.W. 22 A to superintending Consular officers, I should be prepared to adopt 'approved Bill of Landing' system at present in operation for exports from opain and iortugal to most oi their overseas possessions. Under this system instead of applying for certificate of origin and interest shippers submit to His Majesty’s /Consul5, Consul before sbipraent two copies of Bill of Lading or similar shipping document together with relative invoice and such other information as His Majesty*s Consul would require before issuing certificate of origin and interest. His Majesty’s Consuls, if they are satisfied that goods concerned would qualify for a certificate of origin and interest, stamp on each copy of Bill of Lading 'approved for shipment' adding date and name of vessel intended to carry the goods and retain one copy and return the other of the shipper. If they are unable to certify any item they inform the shipper and shipping line concerned and retain both copies of Bill of Lading. Approved Bills of Lading operate for all purposes as certificates of origin and interest and the copy returned to the shippers accompanies the goods.

V ^ \ Continuation this Department Express Letter No:65-C.W.C82)/4I^ dated 31st July 1940 and Nos65-C.W.(149)/40 dated 21st November 1940, on the above subject. v V *To Collectors Customs 2. It is necessary to explain that goods navicerts are granted by British Consular Officers in neutral countries to exporters despatching goods to countries to which the navicert system applied (at present, ail neutral countries kJO ' in Europe, Syria , French West Africa, Portuguese Guinea, ‘ fb* Liberia, Ma3Sg§S'car and Reunion). Such navicerts are carried' in'the same ships as the goods to which they relate, and they! \ normally ensure favourable treatment for the goods covered by them, at British Contraband patrols. The corresponding document which should accompany goods loaded from British Indian ports has been prescribed in this Department letter Not65“C.W.(82) dated 31st July 1940. Ships carrying fully navicerted cargo and satisfying certain other requirements are given special facilities at Contraband patrols and for this purpose, ship navicerts are issued by British Consular or Customs authorities at shijte last port of call, before reach ing any of the destinations (specified above) to which the navicert system applies. Ship Navicerts will therefore have to be issued at an Indian port only if such port happens to be the last port of call before reaching any of the specified countries, and the following procedure should be observed, if occasion should arise for the issue of such a document at *ycur port. any of the ports in - your charge./ (1) It should be ascertained that all cargo shown of 1 l on the manifest as having been loaded at neutral l ports is covered by navicerts and that all cargo 01o Collector of Salt Revenue Madras l shown on the manifest as having been loaded at ^ d Bombay. British ports is covered by certificates to the effect that it has been licensed for export or consists of commodities which do not require export licences as the case may be. (2) A check should be exercised to see that there is no cargo on board which does not appeal' on the manifest, if this can be done without great inconvenience. (3) If you are satisfied as to (1) and (2), you should issue a ship navicert to the master of the ship. This ship navicert would not be a separate document,but would be an endorsement on the ship r s manifest in the following termsi- “It is hereby certified that all the (give number) items of cargo on this manifest have been passed for export”. There should be added thereto the date and the name andtodc designation of the certifying officer. Ships sailing in ballast should be given a ship navicert in the same form, but endorsed with the words f, in ballast ,, . A notification should be made by telegram in code to the Secretary of State and to the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, when a ship navicert has been issued, stating the ship r s name, her Indian port of departure, her date of sailing and her port of destination, in Europe or in one of the other territories to which the ship navicert system has been extended. 4. (4) 'Where a cargo is not completely covered by navicerts or export licences (or does not require export li cences) the master must be informed that, if he does not- 2 - not &amp; C^/ not discharge the items of cargo not covered and sails without ^ obtaining a ship navicort, those items of cargo and the ship itoeax will be liable to seizure* If in spite of this warning the^rnafeter clears without a ship navicert, the Secretary of Stave and the Commander-in-chief, East Indies, should be informed of the facts immediately by telegram in code, full particulars oeing given, there is real ground for suspecting fraud or concealment in to cargo. Seizure of a ship for being un-navicerted does not carry with any automatic seizure of goods laden therein* Fully documented and non-suspect cargo would, .as a rule, not be seized* where regard (5) The authority issuing a Ship Navicert should send a copy of the ship 1 s final manifest direct to the Ministry of Economic Warfare by An- Ha il • 3. Ship navicerts should not be issued to ships which carry:- (i) Mail, -unless it has already been censored, or arrangements have been made which will enable it to be censored. ^ Cases may, however, arise .in which it is not practicable to make such arrangements, and in such cases the grant of a ship navicert might be considered. (ii) Passengers, unless, in the case of passengers^embarking at a neutral port, the passenger list has been submitted^to and approved by the appropriate British Consular authority or, in the case of passengers embarking at British ports, the usual, security requirements have been met. d. An acknowledgment of this letter is requested* Copy of an express letter No* 65-C.w. (149)/4C. , dated the 21st November 1940, from the Secretary to the Govt* of India, Deptt* of Commerce, to the Collector of Customs, Bombay/Calcutta/Madras/Karachi and the Collector of Salt Revenue, Bombay/Madras. • * * • Reference this Department Express Letter No.65-C*W.

Consular Officers should issue a notice as in Annexure A which explains the scope of the Navicert System and given publicity to it in the principal commercial centres. They should^explain to shippers that the System affords a special facility designed to enable His Ma.jesty* s Government to differentiate between shipments to which the Ministry of Economic Warfare are unlikely to raise objections and shipments which if ipmoL persisted in may encounter difficulties and delays at contraband control bases. 2.

For all consignments over 1000 tons, 40s. or the equivalent of a 20-word telegram, whichever is the greater. The charges are experimental for a period of six months from the date of introduction of the System. The cost of telegrams in respect of Navicert applications should be recorded in a separate schedule in the Accounts of the Consulate in order that the cost of this service at the end of the experimental period may be readily ascertained and compared with the receipts from the applicants. 5. instructions to applicants (i) A separate application must be made for each consignment; (ii) Applications for Navicerts can be made before the carrying vessel is known.

(ii) As outlined in paragraph o(v) guarantees (or other documents) are asked for when the consignment is considered important. If eight days after His Majesty’s Consulate in the country of destination has posted to a consignee a request for a guarantee, no reply has been received to the request, the Consul telegrapte accordingly to the Minisory of Kcanomic -warfare. A similar telegram is sen., by the Ministry of Economic Warfare to the Issuing Officer in the exporting country, using the word ” No rep.” Tills will be taken to mean n No reply has been receives, from ohc proposed consignee to the request for a guarantee in respect of the application. Tou should inform the applicant tiiat in ohese circuDastances it is not possible to proceed *it&gt;n iiis appncac»ion. which must accoj. ding— iy be regarded as cancelled, if, however, a satisfactory guarantee is subsequently received from the proposed con signee in respect of this consignment, you will oe informed and should in turn inform the applicant that, if he wishes to renew his application, he can do so without incurring any further charge. You may then at once issue the Navicert informing Ministry of Economic Warfare accordingly. (in)....v.« (iii) If an application is refused because of tlae consignor| the consignee, or on stotisticul grounds 9 it should be made clear that there ar- liable to be difficulties if the goods are shipped. The general practice of the Contraband Committee is to refuse applications only if circumstances would justify seizure of the goods if actually shipped. The Committee is not, however, prepared to grant Navicert facilities to firms on the Statutory or Black Lists or their cloaks. 3. Revoc^tion of ilavicoris: - It is sometimes necessary to revoke a havicert which iias ^been already' isauca. This action is taken only when there is fresh evidence which indicates possible enemy aestination or if the consign* declines to furnish guarantees. If, when a Navicert is revoked, you receive a protest from the original applicant, you should explain that a Navicert is not an imconditionaL passport and that this is made clear in the terms of the issued document, doe paragraph 3(1) 3. Intimation of name etc, of carrying: ve Melsi- (x) The name ana nationality of a carrying vessel should be communicated to you at least three days before shipment, but a Navicert will not be invalidated by any failure to give due notice.

If it is granted after the ship has oailed, a telegram should be sent in’’die following forms- (a) Navicert late (prefix). (b) Name of vessel* (c) Navicert serial numbers.

The entry does not require certification by a Consular Officer. (ii)since cancelled. (ih) When a Navicert is issued after the goods to which it relates have been shipped the shipper should communicate to this Ministry, or to his London agent, the number of the Navicert, the name of the carrying vessel, ah the Bills of la tap* numbers, If shippers can be encouraged to fallow this oro.c tice it may eventually be possible to abandon the procedure outlined in paragraph 9(ii) above. (iv) Having obtained a Navicert, the shipper may not be able +u ship the whole consignment in one vessel. This does not invalidate the Navicert. (v) If, however, the shipper wishes to ship the balance, ho must apply to a Consular Officer for the amendment to be rtified. You should be informed of such amendments. An appro 'date fee should be charged for such certificate, with the object of discouraging application for quantities greater than it Is actually desired to ship* You,You may issue a Navicert for the balance of the consignment without charge and without refe -ance to 'the Ministry of Economic Warfare* The Navicert should be endorsed “Balance” end bear the seme refer - nee number.

They should explain to shippers that the System affords a special facility designed to enable His Majesty’s Government to differentiate between shipments to which the Ministry of Economic Warfare are unlikely to raise objections and shipments which if persisted in may encounter difficulties and delays at contraband control bases. 2. Applications for Navicerts should be in the prescribed form. (Annexore B )* 3. If a Navicert is granted, the application form when endorsed as below, becomes the physical proof that such authorisation has been given. The space at the end of the form is to be endorsed with (i) the words 'so far as is at present known, there is no objection on the part of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to this consignment'; (ii) the facsimile signature of the Consul General ; Consul (iii) the seal of the consulate; (iv) the signature of the consular officer specially designated to countersign Navicerts; (v) the reference letter or letters and number of the Navicert. 4. Fees: - All applications for Navicerts should be referred direct to the Ministry of Economic Warfare. No cha%e will be made if the applications are to be referred by sea borne mail i#e* where tne consignments are unimportant. The number of such applications are not likely to be many. When/- r f 7 4-2“(vi)/ Vjihen applications are telegraphed, the i oil owing charges should be recovered:- For consignments of under 10 tons, 10s. or the equivalent of a 20-word telegram, whichver is the less For consignments of between 10 tons and 100 tons, 20s* or a 20-word telegram, whichever is the less. For all consignments over 100 tons up to 1,000 tons,50s» or the equivalent of a 20-word telegram, whichever is the less. For all consignments over 1000 tons, 40s. or the equivalent of a 20-word telegram, whichever is the greater. The charges are experimental for a period of six months from the date of introduction of the Bystem. The cost of telegrams in respect of Ifevicert applications should be recorded in a separate schedule in the accounts of the Consulate in order that the cost of this service at the end of the experimental period may be readily ascertained and compared with the receipts from the applicants. 5 . Instr uctions to applicants,: - (i) A separate application must be made for each consignment; (ii) Applications for Navicerts can be made before the carrying vessel is Known* In such a case, the the sub-heads Nos.12 and 14 on the application need not be filled in at first, but the inform ation must be supplied by the shipper or a representative of the shipping company at least three days before the date of shipment; (iii) Applications must show full details of the coomodities beirg shipped. If for example, an application covers several types of oil, the quantities of each should be stated separately; (iv) As far as possible, the ultimate consignee should be stated in the application. Applications for shipments consigned to forwarding agents are liable to be delayed, while the ultimate consignees are ascertained by the Contraband Committee. (v) It is advisable that applications should be made at ia&amp;st 10 days before tne proposed date of shipment The minimum 1 time taken to give a decision is about 4 days and in many instances sworn declarat ion from the consignee nave to be obtained and delays are likely to occur in doing so.(iii)/ (Vi) c'*mtries will be intimated from ti^ to time to , ,. , (ill ) To avoid delay, applicants should be encouraged to telegraph the consignees to furnish the necessary guarantees at the nearest British Consulate m respect of the consignments• For this purpose, applicants should be informed of the code letters and the serial number allotted to their applications ( vide para. 7 below). The applicants should quote these numbers in their telegrams and ask the consignees to quote them when making the declarations* The above procedure need not be followed in respect of consignments to certain countries for which no guarantees are a.squired. Name s of such Consular' OlTicefs^n French India and* G-oa. Arrangements may be made by H.M.G. with important private firms by which applications for bavieerts may be made in Lordon* In such cases. Consular Ofileers in French India and G-oa will be informed and instructions to issue navicerts will be issued by telegram as and when applications have been approved. The Consular Officers can then issue Navicerts to the shippers in question upon payment of the approved fee. 6♦ Procedure for telegraphing Navicert ap pl ica tion#,:-* (i) When an application for a Navicert is received, particulars should be at c$ce telegraphed to the Ministry of Economic Warfare in the following form NVC or MIR (prefix for all Navicert telegrams - see sub-paragraph (ii) below) A (code letter for country of destination - see sub-para, (iii) below) 117 (serial number of consignment to that country) S (code letter for issuing consulate - see sub-para (iv) below) Armour Co* (name of consigner) 10 tons (quantity in metric tons where possible) Fat backs (commodity) bans Keen (name of consignee) Madrid (residence of consignee). (ii) 'NGrR* shoulo. be used as prefix when the consignor is adopting the procedure of telegraphing to the consignees to furnish guarantees, outlined in paragraph 5(vi) above. l *NvC M should be used when applicants are not followiig this procedure(iii) The code letters for countries are as follows A - B - D — 3 - f ~ Gr ~ H - J - &amp; T, M - N - ? * Q “ 3 - B - T - U - 7 - f - I - Y - consi to Norway* Sweden. * 9m Switzerland* Greece* Hungary* Belgium* Finland* Latvia. h**4 \ st&gt;- Pr&gt; 1 o v*r3 Netherlands* Portugal* Bulgaria* Houiiania • Spain* Turkey * Lithuania* Italy Yugoslavia* (iv) In due course each Consular Officer issuing Navicerts will be given a code letter which is for the purpose of providing, the identity of the Issuing Officer. This mould be included in ail telegrams after the code letter for the country^of destination and the serial numbers, e.g., if your code letter were 3, a tyoical reference would be K574S. This full reference should also be given to applicants who are ^telegraphing to consignees. (v) All Navicert telegrams should he sent en clair 3 to 'WHISKERS' LONDON, unless local conditions render this inadvisable* If sent in code or cypher they must be addressed to ARFAR, CHSZ iftODRCME. No number other than that of the Navicert is required. If you have any information likely to be useful to the Contraband Committee in consioering an application, this should be included in telegram in code ia (vi) Each telegram should deal with consignments to one country of destination only but iiiay include any number of consignments to that country. The particulars of each consignment must be preceded by its own serial number* P&gt;Vi- 7./; OJn* CkqsZkk !r w *■ Goa^unic a tion of de ciBions by ie cia _ fe n^acrbionTd^be Taken (T -J.'y' V*' ^ A* oflconomic (i) The Ministry of Economic Warfare will telegraph its decision using one of the following code words to indicate the nature of the decisions:- Accio meaning “Navicart should be granted/* meaning “enquiries axe being made#' Mo lor meaning “this application if. refused Because of the unfavourable view we take of the consignor* Onr immediately following telegram (which will be sent in cypher) will indicate the nature of our suspicions if we have not previously communicated them.' signifying, “this application has been refused because re dislike the consignee♦' Molty signifying “this application is refused on grounds connected with the commodity in question and the stocks of it held in consignee’s country.“ guijs meaning “the consignee denies knowledge either of the consignor or consignment: please make further'enquiries•“ Plify meaning, “please amplify name and address of consignee whom we have been unable to trace .* Nore p **.*... See rmt sub-paragraph. (ii) As outlined in paragraph 5(v) guarantees (or other d o o uments ) are a eked for whe n the c onsignme nt is considered important. If eight days after His Majesty*s Consulate in the country of destination has posted to s consignee a request for a guarantee, no reply has been received to the request, the Consul telegraphs accordingly to ±h the Ministry of Economic Warfare* A similar telegram is sent by the Ministry of Economic Warfare to the Issuing Officer in the exporting country, using the word 'Norep.“This will be taken to mean 'Ho reply has been received from the proposed consignee to the request for a guarantee in respect of the application. You should inform the apolicant that in these circumstances it is noVpossible to proceed with his application, which must accordingly be regarded as cancelled. If, however, a satisfactory guarantee is subsequent ly received from the proposed consignee in respect of this consignment, you will be informed and should in turn inform the appli cant that, if he wishes to renew his applicat ion, he can do so without incurring any further charge. You may then at once issue the Navicert inf ormirg Ministry of Economic Warfare accordingly.(ii) Deleted. (iii) If an application is refused because of the consignor, the consignee, or on statistical grounds, it should be made clear that there are liable to be difficulties if the goods are shipped. The general practice of the Contraband Comnittee is to refuse applications only if circumstances would^justify'seizure of the goods if actually shipped. The Committee is not, however, prepared to grant Navicert facilities to # firms on the Statutory or Black Lists or their cloaks. 8* Revocation of Navicerts :** It is sometimes necessary to revoke a Navicert which has been already issued. This action is taken only when there is fresh evidence which indicates possible enemy destination or if the consignee declines to furnish guarantees. If, when a Navicert is revoked, you receive a protest from the original applicant, you should explain that a Navicert is not an unconditional passport and that this is made clear in the terms of the issued document. See paragraph 3(i) 9. Intimation of name e tc, of carrying vessels.!- (i) The name and nationality of a carrying vessel should be communicated to you at least three days before shipment, but a Navicert will not be invalidated by any failure to give due notice. (ii) It is not necessary to telegraph the name of the ship to this Ministry if the Navicert is granted before the ship sails. If it is granted after the ship has sailed, a telegram should be sent in the following formi ca) Navicert late (prefix). (b) Name of vessel. (c) Navicert serial numbers. Where a Navicert application is refused, and the goods are shipped regardless of this refusal, details should be telegraphed. 10. Important instructi ons to shippers (i) It should be made clear to shippers that unless Navicerts are on board the carrying vessel, and the distinguishing letter and number are entered on the ship f s manifest, the consignments are liable to be treated as un-navicerted. The entry does not require certification by a Consular Officer.12. t **# (iii) When a Navicert is issued after the goods to which it relates have been shipped the shipped should comuni cate to this Ministry, or to his London agent, the number of the Navicert, the name of the carrying vessel, and the Bills of Lading numbers. If shippers can be encouraged to follow the practice it may eventually be possible to abandon the procedure outlined in paragraph 9(ii) above. (iv) Having obtained a Navicert, the shipper may not be able to ship the whole consignment m one vessel* This does not invalidate the Navicert* (v) If, however, the shipper wishes to ship the balance, he must apply to a Consular Officer for the amend ment to be certified. You should be informed of such amendments. An appropriate fee should be charged for such certificate with the object of discouraging application for quantities greater than it is actually desired to ship. You may issue a Navicert for the balance of the consign ment without charge and without reference to the Ministry of Economic Warfare. The Navicert should bfe endorsed 'Balance' and bear the same reference number. You should telegraph the details to the Ministry quoting the original reference: e.g. NVC B24US Balance 15 tons * 11. Period of validity and renewal of Navicerts (i) Navicerts are valid only if the goods are shipped within two calendar months of the date of issue. Navicerts may only be renewed with the consent of the Ministry of Economic Warfare to which the application with the date from which renewal is required should be referred as follows:- NAVICERT B 128 S extend August 11. The Ministry’s reply will be as follows NVC B 128 S renew accin (or nolpr, nolee . nolty . or pc ride ). (ii) In the event of a Navicerted consignment being lost by enemy action or otherwise, applications for renewal should be made in the usual way, and referred to the Ministry of Economic Warfare.ljMge..to^’oe laguad by His Majesty's Gonaular Offica rg reeaMir^TM institution of the Navicert System . Hi23 Majesty^ G-overmient in the United Kingdom, ^hile determined to prevent ail contraband trade with the enemy, are, nevertheless, sincerely desirous of reducing to a minimum the interference with neutral trade inevitably occasioned by the exercise of their legitimate belligerent rights. During the war of 1914~18, the so-called Navicert System was introduced for this purpose, and worked to the satisfaction of all concerned. As evidence of their intention to facilitate bona fide neutral trade, His Majesty's Government hereby announce that on y' ,l94ip, they intend to intx'oduce the ■ fy , , , Nayicert system in : ; 5 for shipment to any port in Continental Europe (including Eire Spanish and International Morocco, Spanish a/id Portuguese Atlantic Islands and fui'key) Syi'ia, Erench West Africa, Portuguese Guinea, Liberia, Madagascar, Reunion, Iraq and Iran. The procedure will not however apply to ships all of whose cargo is for United Kingdom ( Mote : Although the Navicert System applies to Iraq aid Iran, cargoes from Kuwait, Bahrain and Muscat to ports within the Persian Gulf (including parts in Iraq or Iran) do not require cargo navicerts. The system has been operating in the United States of America, Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay and other countries for several months past and has proved its value to exporters and shipping companies. Nor the benefit of exporters and others who are not familiar with the operation of the system, a Navicert may be explained as a form of commercial passport. Intending exporters desiring to take advantage of the system will be able to apply to the Consulate-General/ConsuJ^t# on special forms obtainable from/11./ ■? from any British Mission or Consulate; and, if His Majesty^ Government raises no objection to the consignment, they will be granted a Sfabieert for it. A small charge will be made for Navicerts granted to cover the cost of the necessary telegraphic enquiries* The Navicert must be carried in the same ship as the goods to which it relates, and it will then normally ensure favourable treatment at the hands of British contraband patrols. -H—T , Form of application for neutral exporters desiring navicerts* Note:*- This form should be completed in the English r&amp;nguuge » I desire to obtain a navicert for the under-mentioned consignment on the conditions orescribed by tne Government of the United Kingdom.

Cargo consigned from neutral countries to destinations in the Persian Gulf other than Iraq and Iran are not required to be covered by cargo navicerts. If, however, there are grounds for suspicion regarding any items of cargo for destinations other than Iraq and Iran, the facts should be reported to the Secretary of State abox and the issue of Ship Navicerts should be withheld pending instructions. Goods loaded at British Indian ports to Iran and Iraq must be accompanied by a document issued by the Customs Collector stating that the goods loaded at the Indian ports are covered by export licences, or do not require export licences as the caBe may be. (ii) It should be seen that there is no cargo on board which does not appear on the manifest, if this can be done without great inconvenience.

The ship should not be allowed to sail for a port in Navicert area and should not be given a Ship Navicert unless goods are unloaded or approved by Secretary of State. Unapproved cargo which is thus unloaded should be detained but not put into Prize pending a reply from the Secretary of State, The following further instructions regarding seizure of ships and seizure of cargo should be notedx- (i) Decision as to seizure is to be taken by Contraband Committee or Enemy Exports Committee, as the case may be. Particulars of ships and cargo should be telegraphed urgently to the Secretary of State (prefixed MEWIL), in any case where there is real ground for suspecting fraud or concealment in regard to cargo or where an unnavicerted ship appears to be a clear defaulter and liable to seizure. There might be unnavicerted items not on the Contraband List, e.g., tobacco, ana these would not be liable to seizure even though of enemy destination. (ii) Seizure of a ship for being unnavicerted does not (as in the case of seizure of enemy ships) carry with it any automatic seizure of goods laden therein* Fully documented and non—susnect cargo would as a rule not be seized. (iii) Ordinarily, ships without ship navicerts bound to or f j om the Persian Gulf will be diverted to Karachi for examination, but 3.n certain circumstances this examination may have to be carried out at other British Indian ports also.

Their names will be entered against their owners’ names in “ Specified Persons Orders ” and they will in effect be declared enemy vessels, though they may not be liable to actual seizure as Prize. Pending publication in a Specified Persons Order such vessels should be regarded as being in category D.2, unless you are instructed other wise. D.2.

Sir, I am directed by the Minister of Economic Warfare to enclose a copy of the notice appearing in the Board of Trade Journal of the 27th February dealing with the refusal of Navicerts, Certificates of Origin and Interest (or equivalent documents), &amp;c., to consignments insured by enemy companies. 2. On the 13th March it is proposed to give notice of the date when the refusals are to come into force, which date will be about thirty-five days from this second notice, i.e., about the 17th April. His Majesty’s representatives abroad and traders will thus have had ample time in which to adjust themselves to the new regulations. The period has been made as long as this mainly to give traders time to cancel any running insurance contracts which they may have with enemy companies. 3. The list of enemy companies will be sent to you shortly. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, F. W. LEITH-EOSS.

Rev Inverted Navicert system for Spain. His Majesty’s Government have now decided to adopt what has been styled as 'Inverted Navicert System' for the rationing of exports to Spain. Under this system, instead of applications for licences or navi certs being made in the consignor country and then referred to the Ministry of Economic Warfare for con sideration, the first application will come from the consignee end. The Ministry of Economic varf&amp;re will consider such applications and after weeding out un desirable consignees, intimate to the licensing xx&amp;ksx rxty or navicertx issuing authority in the consignor country, particulars of the applications among which the available ration has been apportioned. The system will be applied as from 1st March 1942 to the following among other commoditiesv- (1) Oil seeds (2) Oils (3) Fats (4) Edible oils (5) Jute (6) Scrap iron (7) Manganese ore (8) Sugar (9) Coffee (10) Rubber (11) Hides and Leather (12) Cotton, raw carded and waste. 2. All applications made on or after the 1st March 1S42 for export of the commodities in quest!cn to Spain should be refused unless the Secretary of State for India has previously notified you that the consign ment may be licensed. When an application reco mended by the Secretary of State is refused on supply or other grounds, the fact should be reported to him by teiegrafa. such a contingency will ordinarily arise in respect of goods included in any of tue parts a to D of tne Export Control Notification. Only scrap iron and rubber from #nong the articles listed in paragraph 1 fall in tills category at present. Applications if any, for scrap iron recommended by the Secretar of State should be referred to the Director General, Munitionssi a Production, Calcutta, for orders. Applications for rudder even if recommended by the Secretary of State should be refused. 3. Applications for export of commodities not specified in paragraph 1, if otherwise admissible, should continue to be referred to the Seczvtery of State for India, pending further instructions.

With this exception it is therefore no longer necessary to send us ships manifests or other papers relating to cargo for such countries. 2. Nevertheless (1) M.E.W* still exercises a measure of control over cargo for such countries under the arrangement by ■which M.E.S.C. - approved import licences (against 'which export licences can alone be granted) are only available if M.E.W. tests, by a process of delegation, have been satisfied locally in the Middle East. Jr (11) Persia and Iraq still remain in the navicert area and ships destined for the Persian G-ulf still require ship navicerts. Voyage certificates are not issued by the American authorities when the entire cargo consists of goods consigned to Russia, Persia and Iraq or other countries in the Middle East excluding Turkey. This may seem somewhat anomalous but it is in accordance with American practice and it is not worth attempting to have it altered. The result is that in the Middle East area only commercial consignments destined to Turkey are subject to selected destinations procedure and voyage certificates are issued for vessels carrying commercial cargo (one item or more) to this destination. Voyage certificates are not issued for ships carrying only Lease-Lend for Turkey or only Lease-Lend for Turkey with other cargo for other countries in that region. Military shipments or British Supply Council shipments are not items on which the voyage certificate would be issued because they are either Lease-Lend in the case of Turkey or not going to a selected destination. (m) We regret that we cannot give you a rule which can be more simply stated. The existence of the selected/’ ^de selected destinations and lease-1 end procedure „ » . prevents the making of a simple rule applicable to all countries of origin* Our telegram to Tehran No*57 of the 28th May, 19^3, is incomplete and is overruled by this Savingram* « v (IV) Ships sailing from the Persian Gulf require ship navicerts* (V) Manifests and other documents relating to cargo for Turkey must be sent as heretofore.

BRVALIDITY OF ilWICERTS The Ministry of Economic Vvartare announce the following change in Navicert procedure designed to assist neutral shippers and importers. Under existing regulations, goods .must he shipped Vithin the calendar quarter for which the covering navicert has been issued, and it is realised that it is often difficult for shippers to arrange their shipping . programmes to permit shipment during that period. To meet this difficulty, it has now been arranged* - that as from the 1st January 1945, navicerts will have double calendar quarter validity. Thus navicerts issued for shipment during the first quarter of 1945, will be valid until the 30th June, 1945; those issued for shipment during the second quarter, will be valid until the 30th September, and so on. A period of 10 days grace will continue to be .allowed at the end. of the double validity period for shipments which have been delayed owing to lack of shipping space or for any other reason.£ '/•ill-' Government of India, jjixtemal Affairs Department, Express Letter .

In the latter part of 1943 some vessels whose particulars are mentioned in the enclosed statfeaent arrived at Bombay from the Persian Gulf without Ship Navicerts but they were allowed to proceed as the cargo which was to be cleared at Bombay was not* suspect'. The Agents of the vessels were however advised to instruct masters of vessels to obtain Ship Navicerts prior to departure from the last port of call in the Persian Gulf,as non-production of such Navicert was likely to entail datention at the port and serious interference with the sailing programme. ^ 2^','% 3. m regard to the three vessels - hich arrived from Bahrain in water-ballast, the Agents produced a letter from the Political Agent, Bahrain,to Messrs*Gray Mackenzie and Companyo .C/1411 dated the 2 4th October 1943,frim which it appeared that it was not the practice at Bahrain to issue a Navicert to ships which did not carry cargo. 4. The Regulations do not make any distinct ion, for the purposes of Bhip Navicerts,between vessels carrying cargo and vessels in ballast vide para 2 of instructions under referance.The only exception pemittecTTS in respect of tankers on United Nations Service return ing to the Persian Gulf from Egypt if they are in ballast or carrying only empty oil drams or service stores.The position therefore is that with 1 this except.ion vessels sailing in ballast to or from the Persian Gulf have to be furnished with Ship Navicerts.A confirmation or clarification of this position has been sought for from His Majesty's Government and a further communication, will be made to you when a reply is r ceived from them,It is therefore requested that pending further advice,ship Navicerts be issued for ships sailing in ballast from the Persian Oulf. 5.

M.A. 8.3.45COHFIBi.NTIAL. &amp; op'' SHIP KAVICJbiHT HSGULATIONS Vref&amp;tory Co mpu 1 so ry w av ic e rt sy ste n The Compulsory Navicerty System bod its origin in the Reprisals Order in Council of July 31,2340,und^r which,in order to avert liability to seizure as prize,goods consigned to any port or place from which they might reach the enemy must be covered by vdid navicerts or by valid British or Allied export or transhipment licences; goods shipped from any port from which goods of enemy origin or ownership might have been shipped,by valid c ertificates of origin and interest; and vessels on their* way to or from ports through which goods might reach or come from the enemy, by $h ip N av ic ert s v4. id for the voyage. H.M.Missions abroad were accordingly instructed that the W avlc ert. system was now compulsory for all sea-borne goods from extra- European (and otiier)countries eonsigned to certain named countries- collectively known as the Navicert area.Ships sailing from neutral ports to any part in these named countries must,to avoid liability to seizure as prize,obtain navicerts for all items of cargo and a Ship Navicert. Outward-bourn cargo from any port in these named countries must be cov ered by certificates of origin and interest *nd a Ship Navicert .The Ship Favic ert would be in the form of an endorsement on the ship*s manifest,for vhich application should be made to the British Consul at the last port of loadlng.The origin ally naned countries or territories were; - Finland,the Baltic States, Sweden, gwitzefland,Spain,Po r ugal, opani sh and intemational Morocco ,Y ugo si av ia ,Hun gory, G recce, Bu Igar la, Bo urn an ia ,T u rk ey, JSu ro^ a an Russia,and the Spanish and Portuguese Xxji3c Atlantic Islands. extensions Meanwhile the Ship warrant Scheme came into being,whereby the grant of British-control led shipping facilities to vessels in all parts of the world was made dependent on compliance with these and other conditio ns, failure to observe which might entail revocation of all .Ship warrants granted to their owners. On November 11, 1940, the Compulsory Navicerty .System was extended to French west Afr ca,Portuguese Guinea,Liberia,Madagascar, Reunion and Syria, ships sailing without Ship Navicerts were liable to be Mack-11sted and denied access to all British-contmlied shipping facilities. On November 29, 194D, the System was extended to Iceland. Navicerts were not required for goods shipped from the United States to Iceland, but the vessels must be covered by Ship Navicerts. On January 22, 1941, the System was extended to goods shipped from isire to copiatries in the Mavicert area; and on May 1, 1941,to goods shipped to Hi ire,Goods so shipped must be covered by navicerts or certificates of origin and interest,and the vessel by a Ship Navicert On May 15, 1941, the System was extended to ships sailing to or from the Persian Gulf,which must carry Ship Navicerts; in the latter case whether the approved cargo was destined for countries within or outside the «avicert area. Vessels sailing ballast at to or from the w avicert area had alsojl to be furnished with ship Navicerts. H In addition to cai*go carried,the System was further extended,in so far as regards Ship Navicerts,to include the carriage of mails, passengers and crews.The conditions laid down for the issue of Ship Navicerts requi re(a)that the entire cargo of the vessel shall have been approved by the Ministry of Economic Warfare,©r by a British Commonwealth or Allied Licensing Authority;(b)that, if the vessel is carrying mails,the Master undertakes to call at a designated British port for their fexamination;(c) that, if carrying passengers, the list of these shall have been submitted and approved; and (d)that a list of the officers and crew of the vessel shall have been submitted and approved.In certain circumstances other conditions might also be tuposac The Navicert Area The progress of the war has brought with it other changes and developments.At the present time the Navicert area includes the following countries and territories to which the Compulsory Navicert System is in actual practice applieds- SwGden,lceland,Eire,5Csfffc&amp;: Switzerland, Spa in (including the Balearic Islands),Portugal,and in general all neutral European territories, Spanish Morocco and Tangier. Span ish western Sahara,the Spanish Atlantic lslands(Canaries;, the Portugese islands (Azores.2 f£/ Madeiras, Cape Verdes),Portuguese Guinea, Persian Gulf territories (Iran, Iraq, etc.) Syria (for Shipments via the Persian Gulf),and Turkey, as regards french North and West Africa, see paragraph 19 below Certain special ret irements in the c ase of each of thes*.countries or territories are set out in Section(Tl) below* Tliited states Goods shipped from the United States to countr-es in the Navicert area are now covered by United States export licences, and the vessel by a 'Voyage Certificate' endorsed on the manifest .These are granted by the United states authorities on conditions corres- po r ding to those governing the issue of navicerts and Ship Navicerts respect 1v ely, and have equal validity .The original documents (Voyage Certificate,yoyate Covenant,Shipper* s export declarations,or other official documents relating to cargo) are to be surrendered to the United States Consul at the port of destination,who will communicate them to the British Consul; if there is neither a United States nor British Consul there surrender is to be made to the nearest United States Consul. Croods shipped to the United States from countries in the Navicert area, except Mre, require to be coveredfby certif icates of origin and interest or export passes, and the vessel by a Ship Navicert. &gt;&lt; x ^ Persian Gulf, Iran, Iraq, etc., Syria, Turkey- Si. Vessels sailing to the Persian Gulf require Ship Navicerts, but cargo navicerts,or their equivalent,are only necessary where cargo is consigned to I ran,Iraq, Syria or Turkey .If the vessel is bound for a destination in the Gulf other than Iran or Iraq the Ship Navicert can be granted provided any cargo of neutral origin for I ran,I raq,Syria or Turkey is covered by navicerts.Ships sailing to the Gulf from Latin-American countries should obtain Ship Navicerts at the last p rt of loading in the Americas; if the vessel subse quently loads cargo at a port in Africa or Asia a fresh Ship Navicert should be applied for at that port.Goods shipped from Portugal require to be covered by certif icates of origin and interest and a Ship Navicert; if transhipped in a Portuguese African Colony navicerts must be obtained for than and a fresh Ship Navicert. Goods of British Commonwealth or Allied origin may, if consigned direct to those countries,be assumed t) have been approved in the country of origin. Should there be grounds for suspicion regarding other items of cargo the facts should be reported by telegraph and the ahip Navicert withheld in the meantime.For record purposes copies of the manifests of vessels sailing to the Persian Gulf are only required by the Ministry of ttconoraie Warfare where cargo is consigned to Turkey. Ship Navicerts and cargo navicerts are not required by tankers on United Nations Service returning to the Persian Gulf from Kgypt if they are in ballast or carrying only empty oiigt drums or Service stores. (In thee ase of goods shipped from the United States to the Persian Gulf Voyage Certificates are not issued by the United States authorities where the entire cargo consists of goods consigned to Hussia,Persia,Iraq,or other country in the Middle Bast with the exception of Turkey .Voyage Certificates are issued to vessels carry ing commercial cargo(one item or more)for A urkey,but not if they carry only Lend-Lease goods for Turkey,or only Lend -Lease goods for Turkey among cargo for other countries in that region .Mil it ary ship ments or British Supply Council consignments are not items in respect of which Voyage Certificates are issued). £&amp; 22.Vessels sailing from the Persian Gulf require Ship Navicerts, subject to the usual conditions, provided (a) cargo for countries withint the Nav'cert area is covered by fiavlcerts; (b) cargo for countries outside the Navicert area is approved for shipment by one of Hls.Majesty* s Consuls. Consuls in cases(b)have been provided with a list of goods nomally exported from Iran and Iraq unlikely to originate in enemy territory Goods loaded at ports on the Arab cofSt,and goods loaded in Iranian or Iraqi ports of the listed classes,can be assumed to be approved with#- out the issue of any document,provided tjiey are really of local origin and contain no enemy interest,and in these cases a Ship Navicert may be issued.Approval of the export of all other goods must be evidenced either by a aajckkfxakx certificate of origin and interest,or by one of H.M.Consuls stamping a copy of the Bill of3 m ^ i Lading ‘^Approved for Shipment**; such a copy will then operate for all purposes as a certificate of origin and interest.

If the authority to whom application is made has reason to suspect that listed goods loaded in Iranian or Iraqi ports, or any goods loaded in other Persian Gulf ports, are not of local origin or contain some enemy interest, a Ship Navicert should be witheafcheld, and the facts reported by telegraph to the British representative in the country of loading, and repeated to the Ministry of Kconomic Warfare. Should the vessel sail without a Ship Navicert the Com-rnander-in-Chief,&amp;a!st Indies Station, should at onco be informed.

On page 8 of the revised Ship Navicert Regulations it is stated that M goods loaded at ports on the Arab coast, and goods loaded at Iranian or Iraqi ports on the listed classes can be assumed to be approved without the issue of any documents, provided they are really of local origin and contain no enemy interest, and in these cases a Ship Navicert may be issued”. We agree that petroleum products from Bahrein should be made one of the listed classes and Bahrein treated as a port covered by this rule. This will do away with the need for a cargo navicert. Tankers on United Nations service ieterrang to the Persian Gulf from Egypt in ballast, or with enpty oil drums or Service stores are already exempt from Navicert or Ship Navicert requirements® I think we can now agree to an extension of this in the opposite direction to cover tankers laden with oil for Egypt, or other destination considered safe; i.e. British Commonwealth or Allied ports, or ports controlled by the United Nations. This is a concession which should considerably ease the situation in an area which we consider must remain within the Navicert area. • / ‘ The Persian Gulf must remain in the Navicert area for several reasons, one of which is_ to A South America and Portuguese African &amp;° m G.U.

H.M. Missions abroad were accordingly instructed that the Navicert System was now compulsory for all sea-borne goods from extra-European (and other) countries consigned to certain named countries—collectively known as the Navicert area. Ships sailing from neutral ports to any port in these named countries must, to avoid liability to seizure as prize, obtain navicerts for all items of cargo and a Ship Navicert. Outward- bound cargo from any port in these named countries must be covered by certificates of origin and interest and a Ship Navicert. The Ship Navicert would be in the form of an endorsement on the Ship’s manifest, for which application should be made to the British Consul at the last port of loading. The originally named countries or territories were :— Finland, the Baltic States, Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, Spanish and Inter national Morocco, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Greece, Bulgaria, Roumania, Turkey, European Russia, and the Spanish and Portuguese Atlantic Islands. Extensions Meanwhile the Ship Warrant Scheme came into being, whereby the grant of British- controlled shipping facilities to vessels in all parts of the world was made dependent on compliance with these and other conditions, failure to observe which might entail revocation of all Ship Warrants granted to their owners. On November 11, 1940, the Compulsory Navicert System was extended to French West Africa, Portuguese Guinea, Liberia, Madagascar, Reunion and Syria. Ships sailing without Ship Navicerts were liable to be black-listed and denied access to all British- controlled shipping facilities. On November 29, 1940, the System was extended to Iceland. Navicerts were not required for goods shipped from the United States to Iceland, but the vessels must be covered by Ship Navicerts. On January 22, 1941, the System was extended to goods shipped/row Eire to countries in the Navicert area ; and on May 1, 1941, to goods shipped to Eire. Goods so shipped must be covered by navicerts or certificates of origin and interest, and the vessel by a Ship Navicert. On May 15, 1941, the System was extended to ships sailing to or from the Persian Gulf, which must carry Ship Navicerts ; in the latter case whether the approved cargo was destined for countries within or outside the Navicert area. Vessels sailing in ballast to or from the Navicert area had also to be furnished with Ship Navicerts. In addition to cargo carried, the System was further extended, in so far as regards Ship Navicerts, to include the carriage of mails, passengers and crews. The conditions laid down for the issue of Ship Navicerts require (a) that the entire cargo of the vessel shall have been approved by the Ministry of Economic Warfare, or by a British Common wealth or Allied Licensing Authority ; (b) that, if the vessel is carrying mails, the Master undertakes to call at a designated British port for their examination ; (c) that, if carrying passengers, the list of these shall have been submitted and approved ; and (d) that a list of the officers and crew of the vessel shall have been submitted and approved. In certain circumstances other conditions might also be imposed. The Navicert Area The progress of the war has brought with it other changes and developments. At the present time the Navicert area includes the following countries and territories to which the Compulsory Navicert System is in actual practice applied :— Sweden, Iceland, Eire, Switzerland, Spain (including the Balearic Islands), Portugal, and in general all neutral European territories, Spanish Morocco and Tangier, Spanish Western Sahara, the Spanish Atlantic Islands (Canaries), the (C52718) B *Portuguese Islands (Azores, Madeiras, Cape Verdes), Portuguese Guinea, Persian Gulf territories (Iran, Iraq, etc.), Syria (for shipments via the Persian Gulf), and Turkey. As regards French North and West Africa, see paragraph 19 below. Certain special requirements in the case of each of these countries or territories are set out in Section (II) below. United States Goods shipped from the United States to countries in the Navicert area are now covered by United States export licences, and the vessel by a ' Voyage Certificate ” endorsed on the manifest. These are granted by the United States authorities on conditions corresponding to those governing the issue of navicerts and Ship Navicerts respectively, and have equal validity. The original documents (Voyage Certificate, Voyage Covenant, Shipper’s export declarations, or other official documents relating to cargo) are to be surrendered to the United States Consul at the port of destination, who will communicate them to the British Consul; if there is no United States Consul there surrender is to be made to the British Consul; if there is neither a United States nor British Consul there surrender is to be made to the nearest United States Consul. Goods shipped to the United States from countries in the Navicert area, except Eire, require to be covered by certificates of origin and interest or export passes, and the vessel by a Ship Navicert. In view of these and other recent changes revised instructions concerning the issue of Navicerts have recently been issued. Those relating to the issue of Certificates of Origin and Interest have also undergone modification. As regards the issue of Ship Navicerts, particulars are arranged in the following Sections under the heads :— (I) General. (II) Special Requirements. (III) Carriage of Mails. (IV) Carriage of Passengers. (V) Crew Control. (I) General Ship Navicert 1. The grant of a Ship Navicert, on the application of the Master of a vessel (or Ship’s agent), is customarily effected by the British Consul (or appropriate British authority) at the last port of loading by an endorsement of the ship’s manifest in the following fomiT^ ' ^ “ Ship Navicert ; valid to (specified port). It is hereby certified that the (give number) items of cargo on this manifest have been passed for export. (Date.) (Signature and designation of Consular Officer (or appropriate British authority) and seal (if any).)”. The endorsement should be affixed immediately below the last item on the manifest. If the vessel is required to call at a British or Allied port this should also be stated. For ships sailing in ballast, a Ship Navicert as follows :— “ Ship Navicert ; valid to (specified port). In ballast. (Date.) (Signature and designation of Consular Officer (or appropriate British authority) and seal (if any).)” No fee is charged for the issue of a Ship Navicert. Vessels alone Qualified to Receive 2. Ship Navicerts may only be issued to vessels of the following categories :— {a) those holding valid British Ship Warrants ; (b) those having Ship Warrant status in virtue of their flag, viz. :—British Commonwealth (except Eireann), United States, Dutch, Norwegian, Belgian, Polish, Greek (except those chartered by the Swiss), Russian, Yugoslav, and Free French vessels ; (c) Swedish vessels on approved voyages to and from Gothenburg ; (d) vessels carrying exclusively Relief or Red Cross cargo covered by British or United States Blockade documents, and sailing under safe-conduct with the express approval of the British authorities ; (e) Spanish vessels running to Portuguese ports, or Portuguese vessels running to Spanish ports, and only carrying cargo originating in and destined ultimately for Portugal and/or Spain; or having specific documentary approval of H.M. Government;(/) Spanish vessels running exclusively between Spain and Spanish overseas Possessions, and only carrying cargo originating in Spain or Spanish Overseas Possessions and destined ultimately for Spanish Overseas Possessions or Spain; or having specific documentary approval of H.M. Government. (g) Turkish vessels sailing between Turkish and Allied or Egyptian ports. Master’s Undertaking 3 . Before granting a Ship Navicert, H.M. Consul (or appropriate British authority) must satisfy himself that all items of cargo shown on the manifest have been passed for export and are covered, where necessary, by valid navicerts, British or Allied export licences, certificates of origin and interest, or export passes. As a facility he should be furnished with the information referred to in paragraph 5 below, from Consuls (or British authorities) at any previous ports of loading. He should require from the Master of the vessel a signed undertaking in duplicate, in the form shown in Annex A (for Eastbound Transatlantic voyages), Annex B (for West bound Transatlantic voyages), or Annex C (for other voyages). This undertaking, in short, guarantees, on behalf of the owner or charterer of the vessel, that the following conditions have been, and will be, observed :— Cargo. —Every item is shown on the manifest ; no other cargo will be loaded without entry thereon and previous sanction. Ship’s Money.—(Westbound Transatlantic voyages only). Full details have been furnished ; all such currency will be used for internal ship’s purposes alone. Passengers. —A true list has been submitted ; no others will be embarked without entry thereon and sanction ; strict search will be made for stowaways ; each passenger (in the case of Transatlantic voyages) has signed the required declaration as to articles, etc., carried. Crew. —A true list has been submitted ; no changes or additions will be made without sanction ; they will carry nothing but personal effects (which in the case of Eastbound Transatlantic and certain non-Transatlantic voyages, may include specified amounts of foodstuffs and soap), nor (in the case of Transatlantic voyages) any unauthorised currency ; steps will be taken to ensure observance. Mails, etc. —All bags of certified Diplomatic or Official Mail have been declared ; all bags of Postal Mail carried have been declared and copies of waybills furnished ; any additions thereto will also be declared and copies of waybills furnished ; and all, including correspondence posted on the ship, will be made available to the authorities at the British port to which the vessel undertakes to proceed, if so required ; no other documents, correspondence or packages will be carried for forwarding or handing over ** to anyone in the ports to which the ship is proceeding. Ship’s Box. —Documents carried therein have been submitted ; none but those on the authorised list will be included therein. Bunkers. —Total quantities carried have been declared, all for the ship’s exclusive use ; none will be off-loaded during the voyage, nor without authorisation at the end of the voyage. Stores and Lubricating Oil. —A full list has been submitted, all for the ship’s exclusive use ; none will be loaded during the voyage without approval, and none will be off-loaded at any port of call or discharge without approval; any articles for the use of owners or charterers on shore are treated as freight and entered on the manifest. Departure of Ship. —If delayed for over 72 hours, or if she returns to port, a fresh submission will be made. Ports of Call. —If the ship calls at any port before her declared first port of call, submission will be made to H.M. Consul there, and the undertaking and manifest furnished for his inspection and endorsement. Should she receive instructions while at sea to proceed to any port other than her next scheduled port of call submission will be made to H.M. Consul there, to whom the undertaking and all navicerts, certificates of origin and interest, and other official documents relating to cargo will be surrendered and the manifest exhibited. At ports where cargo is discharged all navicerts, certificates of origin and interest and other official documents relating to such cargo will be surrendered to H.M. Consul there. Arrival at Destination. —The undertaking, duly completed by the Master’s signed declaration that it has been complied with in every respect, will be surrendered to H.M. Consul there and the manifest exhibited. If the Master declines to furnish the required undertaking the fact should be reported by telegraph and the Ship Navicert withheld. If any breach of such an undertaking should afterwards come to light the facts should be fully reported. (C52718) B * 2 mmm 74 Treatment of Master’s Undertaking 4 . When the undertaking has been signed by the Master and witnessed by H.M. Consul (or appropriate British authority) one of the originals should be attached to the ship’s manifest, together with such of the following documents as may have been exacted for the purpose of the voyage, each of which (with the exception of [a] and [d] ) should be stamped “ Seen at the British Consulate at . . . and signed by the Consul (or if at a British port dealt with in a similar manner), the whole being taped together, sealed and handed to the Master for retention in the Ship’s Box in order that it may be available for inspection at any time in the course of the voyage :— [a) Cargo navicerts, export licences, certificates of origin and interest, or export passes. {b) The Crew List (see paragraph 59). (c) The Passenger List (see paragraph 48). (d) Waybills for Postal Mails carried (see paragraph 31). (e) Certificates in respect of Diplomatic or Official Correspondence carried (see ^ paragraph 33). (/■) List of officially sealed envelopes containing correspondence carried in the Ship’s Box (see paragraph 34). And in the case of Eastbound Transatlantic voyages (g) Certificate signed by the Master giving quantities in litres of lubricating oils on board. (h) Stores list (Victualling, Deck and Engine Room). (See Annex D.) (i) List of any private stores carried by the crew. The other original signed undertaking should be forwarded to the Ministry of Economic Warfare by the quickest route available, together with copies of the Ship’s manifest, the Crew list, the Passenger list, copies of waybills for Postal Mail carried, and of certificates furnished in respect of Diplomatic or Official Correspondence carried. ^ \ -■ .n : A i I Previous Ports of Loading. Telegraphic Advices 5. H.M. Consuls (or British authorities) at the original port of loading, and each intermediate port of loading, should furnish the Master of the vessel with a document, to be handed to the Consul (or British authority) at the last port of loading, certifying that all goods loaded at their respective ports have been approved. They should report by telegraph the departure of the ship, the date, her destination, intermediate ports of call, and also the navicert, etc., references to the items of cargo loaded there (unless a copy f of the manifest can be speedily sent to the Ministry of Economic Warfare in ample time beforehand). * Should goods not covered by valid documents have been loaded at a previous port where there is no British Consul, details should be reported by telegraph and a reply awaited before issuing a Ship Navicert. Notification of issue of Ship Navicerts. Vessels Sailing without 6. The departures of vessels from their last port of loading, whether with or without Ship Navicerts, must immediately be reported by telegraph. In the former case, the telegram should be prefaced by the words “ Important. Ship Navicert,” as indicating that the vessel carries a Ship Navicert, and should specify the date of departure, destination, any intermediate ports of call, and the navicert, etc., references to the items of cargo loaded at that port (unless a copy of the manifest can be speedily sent to the Ministry in ample time beforehand). In the latter case, the telegram should be prefaced by the words “ Most Immediate. Without.” as e.g., “ Most Immediate. Without, ss. Timbuctoo. August 30. Master made no application for Ship Navicert,” followed by a brief indication of the nature of the cargo. It is most important that the Ministry of Economic Warfare should at once be informed whether a vessel has sailed with or without a Ship Navicert. Where a vessel that should have been so furnished sails without one, the fact should also be reported immediately to the appropriate Naval Intelligence Centre. In instructions given from time to time it has been laid down that it is important to preserve secrecy concerning ships’ voyages, and that all reports which disclose the where abouts or movements of ships should be sent by cable in cypher, including routine reports of Ship Navicerts.5 British Commonwealth 7. Where a vessel sails from a port in the British Commonwealth direct to a port within the Navicert area, a Ship Navicert will normally have been granted before she leaves H.M. Dominions, unless she has cleared from a port in the United Kingdom, in which case she will be furnished with a Customs War Clearance Certificate. But if, in the course of the voyage, she calls at an intermediate port to load additional cargo she will require a Ship Navicert from the British Consul (or appropriate British authority) there ?'n respect of such cargo. Vessels proceeding direct to a port in the British Commonwealth, with the exception of Eire, from a port within the Navicert Area, do not require Ship Navicerts. But if they intend to call at an intermediate port in the Navicert area to discharge cargo they will require to be furnished with a Ship Navicert. Latin-American Countries 8 . In Latin-American countries the Master of a vessel applying for a Ship Navicert must furnish a statement of all Ship’s stores carried, and certify that they are for her exclusive use (see Annex A). If satisfied that the amounts are reasonable for both outward and return voyages H.M. Consul may approve, but any quantities considered excessive must be unloaded or a navicert applied for in respect of them and referred to the Ministry of Economic Warfare. The term “ Ship’s stores ” includes food for crew and passengers, equipment, spare parts and replacements, lubricating oil for the ship’s engines and machinery, cabin stores, medicinal and surgical appliances, and dunnage. These may not be unloaded or transferred to another vessel without the approval of a British Consul, nor must they include stores, equipment, spare parts, etc., which the owners or charterers may wish to keep at a European port in reserve unless navicerts have been applied for and granted in respect of them. If there is reason to suspect undeclared stores to be on board the Ship Navicert should be withheld until they are unloaded or the suspicion shown to be unfounded. Doubtful cases should be referred to the Ministry with details of stores on board and the condition of wearable stores such as ropes and dunnage. As a guide in checking ship’s stores lists, estimates are given in Annex D of quantities of foodstuffs for crews of the numbers mentioned, and of deck and engine- room stores, paint, rope, etc., which may be considered reasonable in the case of vessels ranging from 4,000 to 5,000 G.R.T. engaged on outward and return voyages of nine weeks duration. Personal effects of the crew may include foodstuffs and soap up to a limit of 20 kilogs per head, of which not more than 5 kilogs may consist of soap ; personal effects of passengers may include foodstuffs up to a limit of 5 kilogs. per head, the amounts of which should be declared by them in Schedule C of the Passenger’s Declaration attached to Annex A. Canned meat, dried fruit, and lard must not, however, be included in these -•allowances of foodstuffs as personal effects without reference to the Ministry. Vessels intending to call at Curacao while on their voyages to the Navicert area should receive Ship Navicerts marked “ Valid only to Curacao.” Switzerland (Cargoes for). Red Cross Supplies, etc. 9. In the case of vessels sailing from overseas on approved voyages to French, or Iberian Peninsular, ports, whether inside or outside the Mediterranean, to unload cargo destined for Switzerland, Red Cross supplies, etc., or for any other approved purpose, the Master shall be required to declare in his undertaking that he will proceed to Gibraltar, and a Ship Navicert should be granted only as far as Gibraltar. The only permissible exceptions to this rule are in the case of vessels proceeding to a port in the Iberian Peninsula specially approved beforehand, or where the vessel has already been subjected to control at a British Control Base. The telegram reporting the departure of the vessel from her original port of loading, and last port of loading, should state the ports to which she is proceeding, as e.g. (in the latter case), “ Important. Ship Navicert, ss. Armando. August 30. Lisbon-Gibraltar-Marseilles,” with, when neces sary (i.e., unless a copy of the ship’s manifest can be speedily forwarded to the Ministry in ample time beforehand) the navicert, etc., references to the goods shipped. The authorities at Gibraltar will, in such cases, issue a Round Trip Ship Navicert to the port of discharge, where this is in the Mediterranean, on condition that the Master undertakes to proceed direct thereto and to make Gibraltar the first port of call on the return voyage. Refugees 10. In the case of vessels carrying numbers of European refugees overseas, the condition may be imposed that the ship must call at a designated British port for examination. Any Ship Navicert issued in cases where such conditions are prescribed should be made valid only to the British port of call specified (see also paragraph 45 (a) ). ■R** (C52718) BI Change of Itinerary 11. Once a Ship Navicert is issued at the last port of loading the vessel should proceed direct to her declared port of destination, unless required to call at a British port in the first instance (for examination of mails, etc.). If, however, owing to unforeseen circumstances, the owners find it necessary to change the vessel’s itinerary, so as to enable her to proceed to another port of call en route, or to another port to discharge, they must report the facts at once to H.M. Mission in the country of destination, or to a British Consul. Failure to do so renders the Ship Navicert invalid (see paragraph 16). The arrival of vessels at ports other than those to which the Ship Navicert was valid should be reported at once to the Ministry by telegraph, as e.g., “ s.s originally Ship-navicerted to has arrived at (Here give Master’s explanation.) ” Carriage of “ Currency ” 12. (1) Regulations known as the “ Defence (Enemy Currency) Regulations ” have been enacted in the United Kingdom and certain Colonies, including Bermuda, Gambia, £ Gibraltar, Jamaica and Trinidad, which state that if “ currency ” as defined in the Regulations is being transmitted from foreign countries to other countries outside the United Kingdom, it is liable to seizure if suspected of being transmitted for the benefit of enemies. All such “ currency ” is regarded as enemy-tainted if exported from Continental Europe and Turkey, French North and West Africa and Tangier. In these Regulations “ currency ” is defined as— (a) coin, gold or silver-bullion, bank notes and other paper money ; (b) postal orders and money orders ; (c) bonds, debentures and any documents of title relating to stock, shares or debenture stock ; f (d) warrants, coupons and vouchers whereunder any interest or dividend is payable. All passengers on Transatlantic voyages are required to sign a personal declaration before embarking, undertaking not to carry with them any “ currency ” as defined under (c) and (d) above, or any “ currency ” as defined under yd) and (b) exceeding in total value the equivalent of U.S. $300, of which not more than U.S. $50 may be in U.S.A. currency or its equivalent in Sterling area currency. Moreover, Masters of vessels applying for Ship Navicerts on Transatlantic voyages are required to sign an undertaking on behalf of themselves and all officers and members of the ship’s crew, acknowledging that the carrying of such “ currency ” constitutes a breach of the undertaking entered into by them ; further, (if Westbound) that all “ currency ” carried ^ for ship’s purposes has been duly declared and that it will be used for internal ship’s™ purposes only (see paragraphs 3 and 7 of Annex A, and paragraphs 3, 4 and 8 of Annex B). (2) Restrictions on the carriage by Eastbound passengers of currency as defined above, and of cheques, drafts, bills of exchange or promissory notes, are set out in para graphs 4 and 5 of the Passenger’s Declaration, Eastbound Transatlantic Voyages (page 18). (3) Restrictions on the carriage by Westbound passengers of currency as defined above, and of cheques, drafts, bills of exchange or promissory notes, are set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Passenger’s Declaration, Westbound Transatlantic Voyages (page 20). War Trade Lists 13. Vessels to which Ship Navicerts may alone properly be issued are shown in the list classified in paragraph 2 above. It follows that a Ship Navicert cannot be issued to vessels on the Statutory List, i.e., those owned or on charter to persons or firms on the Statutory List. The presence of such vessels within his Consular district should be reported by the Consul to the Ministry of Economic Warfare by telegraph, as well as to the appropriate Naval Intelligence Centre. Scope 14. The possession of a Ship Navicert does not exempt a vessel from possible interception and diversion. Surrender 15. On the conclusion of a voyage the endorsed copy of the ship’s manifest, the Master s undertaking, and ail navicerts, export licences, certificates of origin and interest, expon passes, or other official documents issued for the purposes of the voyage, are, in »... i7 so far as they may not already have been surrendered to H.M. Consular Officers prescribed in the Master's undertaking, to be surrendered to H.M. Consul at the port destination, or it there is no British Consul there, to the nearest British Consul. Revocation 16. A Ship Navicert ceases to be valid— (a) if any condition or direction to which it is subject is not observed ; (b) if, after obtaining it, the vessel calls at an enemy port, or at a port in the occupation of the enemy or situated in territory under enemy occupation or control; (c) or (unless otherwise indicated in the Navicert) at any port other than a declared port of destination. Special Requirements. Mails, Passengers, Crews 17. The issue of a Ship Navicert is, in the case of certain countries or territories, subject to the fulfilment of requirements, set out in Section (II) below ; and to compliance with existing regulations concerning the carriage of mails, passengers and crews, as detailed in Sections (111), (IV) and (V) respectively. (II) Special Requirements Eire 18. Ship Navicerts are required in the case of vessels sailing from countries overseas to Eire, or from Eire to countries overseas, other than those of the British Commonwealth or the United States. The vessels must (except in the ca.se of direct voyages from or to the United States, Canada or Newfoundland) call in the first instance at a port in the United Kingdom, and all items of cargo must be covered by navicerts, certificates of origin and interest, etc. For transhipment in the United Kingdom an Import Licence from the Board of Trade is necessary ; if granted, the goods must be consigned “ To the United Kingdom in transit for (name and address of consignee in country of ultimate destination).” Failure to do so renders the documents invalid. Thus, if goods are to be shipped to the United Kingdom for transhipment to a country in the Navicert area, this must be declared at the time of application for a navicert, and the facts reported by telegraph. If approved, it may be taken for granted that the Board of Trade have issued a licence to the British firm acting as intermediary. If the words are added “ Not via the United Kingdom,” this means &gt;that the licence is refused, but that a navicert may be issued for a safe alternative route, • che outcome of which should be reported by telegraph. Consuls issuing certificates of origin and interest should warn applicants of these conditions, and impress upon them the need for a Board of Trade Licence. Board of Trade Licences are not, however, required for onward carriage in the same ship. The Eireann authorities have made arrangements to tranship a large proportion of their imports at ports in the Iberian Peninsula. Navicerts are only issued for such con signments if the Eireann authorities approve them, and have allocated space for their shipment to Eire. French North and West Africa 19. A resumption of private trade with the outside world has not yet been permitted in the case of French North Africa (Algeria, Tunis and French Morocco), but trade on a “ compensation ” basis has been established with Spain and Portugal, for the purposes of which a document entitled a “ Round-Trip Ship Navicert ” is in approved cases issued by H.M. Consuls in Spain and Portugal to the Spanish or Portuguese vessels concerned, covering both the outward and return voyages. In reporting its issue particulars should be given of the cargo carried with its port of destination in French North Africa, and of the cargo it is intended to bring back, with its port of destination. Passengers or mails are not carried by these vessels unless specially authorised by the terms of the Round-Trip Ship Navicert. Should trade be authorised with Switzerland or other neutral countries the cargoes carried would be similarly subject to approval beforehand, and the vessel required to obtain a Round-Trip Ship Navicert at Gibraltar or some other suitable port. In those cases where trade, which according to present arrangements will be in a strictly controlled form, takes place between French West Africa (comprising Mauretania, Senegal, French Guinea, Ivory Coast, French Togoland, Dahomey, French Sudan and French Niger Colony) and neutral contries in Europe, the usual Ship Navicert arrangements will normally apply. (C52718( B ** 2Iceland 20. Goods shipped to Iceland require to be covered by navicerts and the vessel by a Ship Navicert. Navicerts are not required for goods shipped from Iceland to destinations outside the Navicert area, but the vessel must be covered by a Ship Navicert. Persian Gulf. Iran, Iraq, etc., Syria, Turkey 21. Vessels sailing to the Persian Gulf require Ship Navicerts, but cargo navicerts, or their equivalent, are only necessary where cargo is consigned to Iran, Iraq, Syria or Turkey. If the vessel is bound for a destination in the Gulf other than Iran or Iraq the Ship Navicert can be granted provided any cargo of neutral origin for Iran, Iraq, Syria or Turkey is covered by navicerts. Ships sailing to the Gulf from Latin-American countries should obtain Ship Navicerts at the last port of loading in the Americas ; if the vessel subsequently loads cargo at a port in Africa or Asia a fresh Ship Navicert should be applied for at that port. Goods shipped from Portugal require to be covered by certificates of origin and interest and a Ship Navicert; if transhipped in a Portuguese African Colony navicerts must be obtained for them and a fresh Ship Navicert. Goods of British Commonwealth or Allied origin may, if consigned direct to those countries , be assumed to have been approved in the country of origin. Should there be grounds for suspicion regarding other items of cargo the facts should be reported by telegraph and the Ship Navicert withheld in the meantime. For record purposes copies of the manifests of vessels sailing to the Persian Gulf are only required by the Ministry of Economic Warfare where cargo is consigned to Turkey. Ship Navicerts and cargo navicerts are not required by tankers on United Nations Service returning to the Persian Gulf from Egypt if they are in ballast or carrying only empty oil drums or Service stores. (In the case of goods shipped from the United States to the Persian Gulf Voyage Certificates are not issued by the United States authorities where the entire cargo consists of goods consigned to Russia, Persia, Iraq, or other country in the Middle East with the exception of Turkey. Voyage Certificates are issued to vessels carrying commercial cargo (one item or more) for Turkey, but not if they carry only Lend-Lease goods for Turkey, or only Lend-Lease goods for Turkey among cargo for other countries in that region. Military shipments or British Supply Council consignments are not items in respect of which Voyage Certificates are issued.) 22. Vessels sailing from the Persian Gulf require Ship Navicerts, subject to the usual conditions, provided {a) cargo for countries within the Navicert area is covered by navicerts ; if) cargo for countries outside the Navicert area is approved for shipment by one of H.M. Consuls. Consuls in cases (b) have been provided with a list of goods normally exported from Iran and Iraq unlikely to originate in enemy territory. Goods loaded at ports on the Arab coast, and goods loaded in Iranian or Iraqi ports of the listed classes, can be assumed to be approved without the issue of any document, provided they are really of local origin and contain no enemy interest, and in these cases a Ship Navicert may be issued. Approval of the export of all other goods must be evidenced either by a certificate of origin and interest, or by one of H.M. Consuls stamping a copy of the Bill of Lading Approved for Shipment” ; such a copy will then operate for all purposes as a certificate ofori gin and interest. Approval of cargo loaded at Bandar Shapur will be signified by H.M. Consul at Ahwaz. Ships loading cargo at ports in the Gulf other than Bahrein, Koweit, Basra, Khorramshahr, Bandar Shapur, Bushire and Bandar Abbas will be required to call subsequently at a neutral port where there is a British Consul, or at a British Empire port, or at Koweit, Bahrein, or Muskat, in order that a Ship Navicert may be issued in appropriate cases. If the authority to whom application is made has reason to suspect that listed goods loaded in Iranian or Iraqi ports, or any goods loaded in other Persian Gulf ports, are not ot local origin or contain some enemy interest, a Ship Navicert should be withheld, and the facts reported by telegraph to the British repre sentative in the country of loading, and repeated to the Ministry of Economic Warfare. Should the vessel sail without a Ship Navicert the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station, should at once be informed. Ship Navicerts are not required for vessels plying solely within the Persian Gulf, the eastern limits of which are deemed to be a line drawn from Ras Masandam to a point immediately east of Bandar Abbas. Portugal. Spain. Spanish Morocco and Tangier 23. The Compulsory Ship Navicert System applies to all vessels trading between Spain and Portugal. It has not yet been applied to voyages between ports in Spain, Spanish Morocco, Tangier and the Balearic Islands, though on these routes vesselsmay obtain Ship Navicerts on application. Such exemption does not extend to Ocean going vessels whose final destination is beyond those territories, and these should be furnished with Ship Navicerts. At the same time it is highly important for the due observance of the rationing arrangements contemplated in the case of each of these countries or territories, that the Ministry of Economic Warfare should be in possession of the fullest details procurable of all goods imported or exported by each of them. Special arrangements have therefore been made whereby the arrivals and departures of all vessels, of whatever category, at or from ports in Spain, Portugal, Spanish Morocco, and Tangier, are reported to the Ministry by means of a daily return on a specified form, with particulars of the cargo they load for, or unload from, the neighbouring countries or territories. The departures of vessels whether with or without. Ship Navicerts, on routes where these are compulsory, should be reported by telegraph in the approved form, and be repeated to Gibraltar, specifying the date and hour of departure, destination and any intermediate ports of call (with anticipated date of arrival at first port of call) and all necessary particulars respecting mails, passengers, etc. Consuls at intermediate ports should in their turn report the departure of the vessel. The arrival of vessels in Spain or Portugal at ports other than those to which it was declared when granted a Ship Navicert they intended to proceed should be at once reported by telegraph in the manner enjoined in paragraph 11 above. Portuguese and Spanish Atlantic Islands 24. Vessels trading between Spain or Portugal and the Canary, Azores, Madeira or Cape Verde Islands ; or between Spanish Morocco or Tangier and those Islands ; or between the Spanish Islands and the Portuguese Islands, require to be furnished with Ship Navicerts. If vessels engaged in longer oversea voyages, and already furnished with Ship Navicerts, call at those Islands to load additional cargo there a fresh Ship Navicert becomes necessary, and should be applied for at the local British Consulate. If, on the other hand, such vessels call solely for the purpose of obtaining necessary ships’ stores or bunkers, without loading any additional cargo there, then, in view of the terms of the Master’s original undertaking, the following rules should be observed :— (1) H.M. Consul should endorse the Ship Navicert already held by the vessel to the effect that the ship called at to load tons of bunkers and/or ...... tons of ship’ stores, and that the Ship Navicert is now valid to (next port of call). (2) A list of the stores embarked, signed by the Master and H.M. Consul, should be attached to the Master’s original undertaking, the latter being endorsed (against “ Ship’s stores and Lubricating Oil ”) to the effect that the list has been so appended. (3) Similarly the Master’s original undertaking should be endorsed and signed by the Master and H.M. Consul to show the amount of bunkers taken in. Vessels sailing from Latin-American countries with cargoes of grain, etc., and putting into those Islands for orders as to their final port of destination, must also obtain new Ship Navicerts there for the completion of their voyage. The instructions to British Consuls in those Islands enjoin that the arrivals of all vessels should be reported by telegraph with the following particulars :—date of arrival; where the vessel has sailed from ; any cargo not covered by navicerts ; in the case of tankers all cargo even if covered by navicerts ; cargo to be discharged locally whether covered by navicerts or not; and any cargo to be transhipped, with the name of the on-carrying ship. Departures should continue to be reported by telegraph, with the customary particulars, and should indicate by the prefix “ Important^ Ship Navicert ” or “ Most Immediate. Without ” (see paragraph 6) whether the ship carries a Ship Navicert or not. The system of daily returns of the arrivals and departures of ships and cargoes (referred to in paragraph 23 above) has also been extended to these Islands. Potuguese Colonies (Angola, Mozambique) 25. In the case of goods shipped from Angola, Mozambique, or San Thome, to Portugal or Portuguese Guinea or the Portuguese Atlantic Islands, the Ship Navicert should be made valid only to the vessel’s next port of call, where a further Ship Navicert may be obtained for the next succeeding stage of the voyage to the following port of call. The endorsement on the Ship’s manifest should be to the following effect:— ' I hereby certify that all cargo loaded at has been passed for export, and that this endorsement constitutes a Ship Navicert which is only valid up to and excluding (name of next port of loading whether a port where there is a British Consul or not).”10 Spanish Possessions in Gulf of Guinea 26. In the case of goods shipped from Spanish Possessions in the Gulf of Guinea to Spain or to the Spanish Atlantic Islands or other Spanish possessions, the Ship Navicert should be obtained from the British Consul at the last port of loading before the vessel reaches its destination. At previous ports of loading the Master should be given a document to the effect that the goods loaded there have been approved (see paragraph 5). Sweden 27. The grant of a Ship Navicert to a vessel proceeding from overseas to Gothenburg requires special authorisation, which is only given in the case of vessels nominated by the Swedish Legation in London and approved beforehand by the Ministry of Economic Warfare. In the case of ships outward bound from Sweden the actual stamping of the manifest is dispensed with, and a special document carried, similarly worded, and endorsed with the date of sailing of the vessel from Gothenburg. By virtue of agreement, Consular certificates of origin and interest are not issued f for cargo carried on Swedish ships outward bound from Sweden. Such cargo is covered by certificates issued by Swedish local bodies which have the same validity as Consular certificates. * Switzerland 28. See paragraph 9. Syria 29. Shipments for Syria and Lebanon do not require to be covered by navicerts, unless intended to be shipped via the Persian Gulf (see, on this point, paragraphs 21 and 22), in which case a Ship Navicert becomes necessary. But a strict licensing system has been introduced by the Syrian and Lebanese authorities, and the issue of a navicert in such cases merely denotes that no objection is seen to the goods being shipped via the Persian Gulf, and does not imply that an import licence has been granted or is not necessary. Turkey 30. For shipments via the Persian Gulf, see paragraphs 21 and 22. (Ill) Carriage of Mails, etc. Master’s Undertaking 31. The grant of a Ship Navicert to a vessel carrying Postal Mails can, as a general rule, only be authorised on condition that the Master in his undertaking (Annex A, B, or C)^ agrees to call at a designated British port for their examination, and furnishes copies of the* waybills for treatment in accordance with the prescriptions of paragraph 4 above. Certain exceptions to the rule as to calling at a British port are mentioned in paragraphs 38, 39, 40 and 42 below. Postal Mail (Telegraphic Advices) 32. In reporting the issue of a Ship Navicert to a vessel carrying Postal Mail, H.M. Consul should add in his telegram the following particulars :— (a) where the vessel undertakes to call for the examination of mails ; (b) the number of bags of Postal Mail loaded ; (c) the countries to which these mailbags (or outer mailbags) are respectively addressed ; (d) if (i) empty, (ii) Prisoner of War, (hi) Red Cross, (iv) British or United States Army, or (v) of British Commonwealth origin or destination, mailbags are carried, the total number (but not destination) in each case should be stated separately. These particulars, on their receipt by the Ministry, will be communicated to the British Censorship Stations concerned, who will thus be enabled to check the number of mailbags unloaded against those reported. In the case of vessels sailing direct to the United States, the Ministry will inform the United States authorities through the medium of the British Censorship offices in the United States. Diplomatic Correspondence 33. The carriage of Diplomatic Correspondence calls for special mention in view of the exceptional treatment accorded to correspondence of this nature. Attention is accordingly directed to Annex F (page 25), which in paragraphs 3, 4 and 8 defines the communications which may properly be regarded as coming under the head of Diplomatic11 Correspondence, the conditions attaching to their privileged treatment, the form of certificate required for this purpose, and the conditions applicable in the case of accredited couriers carrying such correspondence. In particular, it will be observed from paragraph 5 of that Annex that a vessel carrying Enemy Diplomatic or Consular Correspondence must undertake to call in the first instance at a British port. Official Correspondence Official Correspondence, a term which includes bags containing purely official matter passing between the Government of a non-enemy country and its administrative officers in an overseas Possession of that country, is similarly dealt with in Annex F, which in paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 lays down rules to be observed in the treatment of such communi cations, the form of certificate requisite for the purpose, and the conditions applicable in the case of accredited couriers carrying such correspondence. Diplomatic and Official Correspondence (Telegraphic Advices) Care should be taken when reporting the issue of a Ship Navicert to a vessel carrying £ either Diplomatic or Official Correspondence that, as prescribed in paragraph 8 (v) of Annex F, the number of bags of such correspondence carried, and their respective destinations, are stated separately in the telegram under each of these heads and as distinct from those relating to Postal Mails. Ships’ Boxes 34. Documents carried in Ships’ Boxes, in whatever form the latter may be main tained on board the vessel, require to be watched with care to prevent abuses, and in Annex E (page 24) rules are laid down for guidance in this respect. Paragraph 2 of that Annex sets out a list of the documents which may alone properly be carried in a Ship’s Box, while paragraphs 3 to 8 prescribe duties assigned to H.M. Consular Officers or the appropriate British authorities, at ports of origin, during the course of the voyage, and at ports of destination respectively. Important points to observe are that no correspon dence other than that defined under the heads (/) and (i) in the list in paragraph 2 of that Annex should be permitted to be carried in a Ship’s Box, that no remittance may accom pany the consignee’s mail (i), and that a list of the officially sealed envelopes in which such correspondence is enclosed is maintained throughout.the course of the voyage. Passengers’ Declarations 35. Where passengers are carried by vessels on Transatlantic voyages the issue of a Ship Navicert requires that each passenger shall have signed a declaration engaging not to carry, or to cause to be carried on his or her behalf, correspondence, documents, pack ages, currency, etc., other than such as may have been specifically provided for by the % terms of that declaration. The form of declaration required for this purpose varies in certain respects according as the vessel is engaged on an Eastbound or Westbound Trans atlantic voyage, and is shown respectively on pages 18 and 20. Letters of introduction may be carried by passengers, but only if they appear to have been written solely for the purpose stated and do not contain any irrelevant matter. All such letters sanctioned by H.M. Consular Officers should be set out on Schedule A attached to the declaration of the passenger concerned. Crew Control 36. In his undertaking (Annex A, B, or C) the Master of the vessel binds himself to exercise a similar control as regards the carriage of unauthorised correspondence, documents, articles, currency, etc., as set forth therein, either by himself or the officers or members of the crew. Censorship Stations 37. The Censorship Stations customarily designated for the voyages mentioned below are as follows — (1) between territories in the Americas and European or African countries or territories (including the Atlantic Islands) within the Navicert Area— Trinidad. Or in the case of Turkey, should Trinidad be impracticable, the first port of call in Egypt, for Cairo ; (2) between Portugal and Angola or Portuguese East Africa—Capetown [see, paragraph 40 (c) ) ; (3) between Portugal or Portuguese Possessions within the Navicert Area and Portuguese India—Bombay (see paragraph 40 (d) ) ; (4) between Switzerland via Marseilles and (a) Lisbon or (b) direct and the Atlantic Islands—Gibraltar. If the vessel is on a longer voyage to or from Latin America—Trinidad ; (C52718)(5) between Eire and the outside world—the United Kingdom ; (6) between the Persian Gulf and— (a) countries to or from which vessels must sail round the Cape of Good Hope—Capetown ; (b) East Africa—if possible Bombay, otherwise Mombasa or Karachi; (c) ports East of the Persian Gulf—if possible Bombay, otherwise Colombo ; (d) Latin American countries—Capetown, or if they prefer, Trinidad, provided there is no intermediate port of call between these Stations and the Persian Gulf. Note .—Some outward mails may, so far as capacity allows, be examined at Gibraltar. Normally a call at Gibraltar will not affect the necessity for a subsequent call in accordance with (1) and (4) above. British Commonwealth and United States 38. Closed terminal mailbags to or from the British Commonwealth or the United States, or Red Cross, Prisoner of War, and British and United States Army mailbags, do not entail calls at a British Censorship Station for their examination, as such mails are respectively examined on their arrival at, or before their departure from, the ports in the British Commonwealth or the United States concerned. Similarly no call is required for vessels carrying only empty mailbags. Eire 39. Terminal mails to and from Eire must be routed through the United Kingdom. Spanish and Portuguese Overseas Possessions 40. {a) Spanish Postal mails between Spain and Spanish Overseas Possessions, viz. the Canary Islands, Spanish Western Sahara, Fernando Po, Rio Muni and Annobon, or between any of those possessions, are not normally subjected to Censorship, though the right to intercept such mails for examination is reserved. Such mails in vessels calling voluntarily at Gibraltar are of course subject to Municipal law. (6) Portuguese Postal mails between Portugal and the following Portuguese Overseas Possessions, viz. the Azores, Madeiras, Cape Verde Islands, Portuguese Guinea, San Thome and Principe, or between any of those possessions are not normally subjected to Censorship, though the right to intercept such mails for examination is reserved. Such mails in vessels calling voluntarily at Gibraltar are of course subject to Municipal law. f Angola, Mozambique (c) Portuguese Postal mails between Portugal or Portuguese Overseas Possessions within the Navicert Area and Angola or Mozambique are subject to Censorship and are examined at Capetown. By agreement mailbags for Angola are enclosed in outer bags externally addressed to Mozambique, and no ordinary mailbags externally addressed to Angola may be accepted. At Capetown the outer bags are removed and the mails sent on by rail to Angola and Mozambique respectively. Postal mails from Angola and Mozambique are sent by rail to Capetown for examination before being loaded on ships sailing for Portugal or Portuguese Possessions within the Navicert Area. Portuguese India] (d) Portuguese Postal mails sent from Portugal or Portuguese Possessions within the Navicert Area to Portuguese India are by agreement placed in outer bags externally addressed to Bombay, and no bags externally addressed to Portuguese India may be accepted. Spanish and Portuguese Atlantic Islands 41. As regards Spanish and Portuguese mail communications with these Islands, see paragraph 40 (a) and (b) above. In all other cases vessels calling at the Azores, Madeiras, Canaries or Cape Verde Islands from without the Navicert Area must, if they are carrying mails other than Diplomatic or Official correspondence, call at a British port before reaching these Islands, and vessels calling at these Islands on outward voyages must, if carrying mails other than Diplomatic or Official correspondence, call at a British port after leaving these Islands.13 Sweden 42. Swedish vessels voyaging between Sweden and South America do not carry Postal mails and are consequently not required to call at a British port for their examination. Special arrangements are in force as regards the carriage of Diplomatic and Official correspondence and Ships’ Box mail by such vessels. Swedish vessels sailing from or to ports other than Swedish ports must, on applying for Ship Navicerts, conform to the ordinary procedure laid down in the preceding para graphs, or Annexes, as regards carriage of Postal mails or Diplomatic correspondence. United States 43. See Prefatory Notes, and paragraphs 32 and 38 above. Restrictions (IV) Carriage of Passengers 44. It is desirable to restrict in every way possible the travel of enemy persons, those belonging to enemy-occupied or controlled countries, and dangerous neutrals. If a vessel carries passengers it is a necessary condition before a Ship Navicert can be issued in her favour that the passenger list shall have been submitted for approval. Ships carrying unapproved passengers will be refused Ship Navicerts. If the vessel nevertheless proceeds without one, she is liable to interception, and her owners to cancellation of all Ship Warrants they may hold, and to their vessels being denied all British-controlled shipping facilities. Ships leaving the Navicert Area 45. For ships leaving the Navicert Area the conditions prescribed are as follows :— {a) Enemy persons will not be allowed to travel until their requests for facilities have been referred to the Ministry of Economic Warfare and have been approved. The only exception to this rule is in the case of refugees, where Passport Control Officers have discretion to grant facilities unless there is seeming ground for suspicion. (b) Persons belonging to enemy-occupied or controlled territories will be treated as enemy persons, though their applications may be dealt with more leniently, in the light of their individual record. (c) Persons belonging to French territories not declared under enemy control, but which have not joined the Allied cause will be treated in the same way as (b). (d) Persons belonging to French Colonies which have declared for the Allied cause may be regarded as allies if of French nationality, and as friendly neutrals if merely resident there. (e) Neutrals and Allied persons will be allowed to travel without restriction unless there is reason to suppose they are working in enemy interests. In these cases Consuls must use discretion, but they will be advised from time to time of the movements of persons known to be travelling for the enemy. British subjects who have been declared enemy and have bee'n placed on the Statutory List will be treated as working for the enemy. (/) Doubtful cases in all classes should be referred to the Ministry of Economic Warfare. Ships Sailing to the Navicert Area 46. For ships sailing to the Navicert Area the conditions are the same in principle, but in practice, will for the present be modified as follows :— (g) Persons in class (a) above will normally be refused permission to travel, doubtful cases being referred to the Ministry for decision. (h) Persons in class (b) will normally be allowed to travel unless men of military age or technicians. (i) Persons in classes (c), (d) and (e) above may be dealt with in the light of their individual record. Great discretion should however be used in dealing with nationals of the country in which they reside, and doubtful cases should be referred to the Ministry. Persons in these classes will not be permitted to travel if there is any ground for believing that their journey will assist the enemy’s war effort. -14 Definitions 47. In the foregoing “ Enemy persons ” means all persons having enemy status, whether of enemy nationality or not, but in accordance with normal principle does not include persons merely by reason of their enemy nationality. At the same time enemy nationals in neutral countries should be regarded as having enemy status unless their residence there is such as to entail permanent loss of their connexion with enemy territory and freedom from enemy influence. “ Persons belonging to ” territories is intended to cover all persons irrespective of nationality who have a substantial connexion with the territory. Possession of the territorial nationality is only a guide and not a determining factor, but generally a national of the territory should be regarded as belonging to it unless permanently resident else where and clearly devoid of connexion with it and free from the influence of its authorities and of the enemy. “ Neutrals ” include for these purposes any persons who, despite their enemy or enemy-occupied or controlled nationality are not under the above definitions to be treated as enemy persons or persons belonging to enemy or enemy-occupied or controlled territory. Passenger Lists. Passenger Declarations 48. The signed undertaking required of the Master of a vessel before a Ship Navicert is issued (Annex A, B or C) prescribes that where passengers are carried a true copy of the Passenger List shall have been submitted and approved, and that no others shall be embarked without entry thereon and previous sanction ; and also, in the case of Trans atlantic voyages (Annex A or B), that each passenger shall have furnished a declaration promising to abide by the conditions laid down therein as regards the carriage of correspondence, documents, articles of value, currency, etc., of the nature mentioned, either personally or by others on his or her behalf. The terms of this declaration vary according as the vessel is engaged on an Eastbound or Westbound Transatlantic voyage, and are shown respectively on pages 18 and 20. Certain special points arising in the case of these declarations are mentioned in paragraphs 12 and 35 above and in Annex F, paragraph 8 (iv). Passenger Lists. Checking 49. Shipping companies should be informed by H.M. Consuls that in their own interests, and to avoid delays, they should submit lists of proposed passengers well in advance of sailings. It might indeed be intimated to them that the most convenient and expeditious course would be for them to consult the Consul before accepting bookings. 50. When the Passenger List is received it should be carefully checked by the J Consul and the Passport Control Officer (if available), in the light of the foregoing observations, doubtful cases being referred to the Ministry of Economic Warfare. War Trade Lists 51. Persons on the Statutory List or Black List, or who are connected with firms on those lists, should not be granted facilities to travel without reference to the Ministry, stating the reasons for their desire to travel. Approval 52. When the list of passengers has been finally approved the Shipping Company may be informed that the carriage of the persons in question would not prejudice the issue of a Ship Navicert. Endorsement 53. After final approval the Passenger List should be endorsed as follows :— “ So far as is at present known there is no objection to the carriage of the passengers on this list. “ (Date) (Signature, designation and seal of Consular Officer).” If for any reason it is found necessary to refuse to endorse the passenger list of a vessel the Consul should inform by telegram the authority to which the ship’s master will subsequently apply for a Ship Navicert of the reasons for the refusal. Suspects 54. While the form of passenger control set forth above is primarily for reasons of Economic Warfare, it may on occasion be used by other authorities having special interests. Their instructions will be transmitted either through the usual channels or in the f&lt; Arfar ”series. In special cases suspected persons may exceptionally be allowed to proceed provided the vessel is calling at a British port where possibilities of a further and closer examination exist. Permission should therefore not be refused automatically where the Consul considers it may be in British interests to allow the passenger to proceed, in order that he or his baggage may be examined at a British port, or if he is sufficiently important to cause the ship to be intercepted. Such cases, primarily consisting of notorious enemy agents, should be reported by telegraph in case any action of this nature is contemplated. Telegrams 55. All telegrams from Consuls concerning the approval of passengers in connexion with the granting of a Ship Navicert, should be sent in the “Arfar” series of telegrams, and marked at the end “ Please copy to Admiralty A.D.N.I. and Foreign Office.” [See, however, paragraph 57.) Appeals 56. Consular Officers will probably receive appeals against the decisions taken. It must be left to their discretion whether [a) to reject such appeals, (6) to refer them to the Ministry, or (c) to refer them to another interested authority. Enemy Diplomatic and Consular Officials, etc. 57. As regards Diplomatic or Consular Officers of enemy or enemy-controlled terri tories who wish to travel, all cases of this nature should be referred to the Foreign Office for decision. A similar reference should be made in the case of applications on behalf of persons employed by Diplomatic and Consular Officers. The exact status of these persons should be reported, as well as their activities and reasons for wishing to travel. All telegrams on this subject addressed to the Foreign Office should be marked “ Please copy to Admiralty A.D.N.I. and Ministry of Economic Warfare.” (V) Crew Control Supervision 58. It is necessary to maintain a close supervision over the crews of vessels sailing to or from the Navicert area, in order to prevent smuggling or other illegal activities on their part on behalf of the enemy. In his undertaking when appfying for a Ship Navicert (Annex A, B or C) the Master of a vessel is required to guarantee that nothing but personal effects will be carried by himself or by the officers or members of the crew, nor any documents, correspondence, or packages for forwarding or handing over to any person in the ports to which the ship is proceeding. H.M. Consuls (or appropriate British authorities) should avail themselves of all sources of information open to them, officially or locally, which might serve to detect any breach of these essential requirements. Crew Lists 59. Before a Ship Navicert is granted a complete list, in quadruplicate, of the officers and crew of the vessel must be furnished by the Shipping Company or Agent, and a Ship Navicert should only be issued if the list is in all respects satisfactory or if any objected to do not sail. The list should give particulars of the registration papers of each member of the crew, and if required these papers should be furnished in support. The list should be checked in conjunction with the Passport Control Officer, who, after approval, should endorse the four copies thus :— “As far as is at present known, there is no objection to the carriage of the (number) .... members of the crew on this list, which consists of... .pages. (Place and Date) (Signature of Passport Control Officer) (Consular seal) Treatment of Crew Lists 60. The four copies of the list should then be treated as follows :— (a) the first and second copies should be attached to the Master’s undertaking, with its original documents, as prescribed in paragraph 4, above, and handed to the Master for retention in the ship’s box and production at any time, as may be required, during the course of the voyage ;16 3t- (b) the third copy should be attached to the duplicate of the Master’s undertaking, which, with its accompanying documents, is to be transmitted to the Ministry of Economic Warfare by the quickest available route, as also prescribed in paragraph 4 above ; (c) the fourth copy should be retained by the Passport Control Officer in his records ; (d) on arrival at any intermediate port of loading or call the Master of the vessel should be required to hand the documents mentioned in (a) above to H.M. Consul (or British authority) at that port, and to notify any changes that may have taken place in the Crew List, which should in this event be duly recorded on the two copies of the list, stating the reason for the changes. If space is not available an extra sheet may be attached to each copy for the purpose; (e) On the arrival of the vessel at its ultimate destination one of the copies mentioned in (a), with its annotations showing any changes which may have occurred in the Crew List during the course of the voyage, should be forwarded to the Ministry of Economic Warfare. Undesirables 61. Lists of undesirable seamen are compiled in the Ministry of Economic Warfare and circulated officially for information. In extreme cases such seamen may be placed on the Statutory List. All information of interest concerning seamen which may prove useful for the purposes of this record should therefore be reported to the Ministry as well as to the Passport Control Officer. Enemy Nationals, etc. 62. Seamen of Japanese nationality (or with Japanese names) or of German nationality are always to be treated as undesirable ; if of other enemy nationality, or if of dual nationality or stateless, reference should wherever necessary be made to the Ministry. Evasions 63. Individuals signing on as crew for a single voyage, or who do not appear for other reasons to be bona fide members of the crew, should be treated as passengers and dealt with under the rules laid down in Section IV above.

If, in spite of my thorough search, stowaways are found while the vessel is at sea, I undertake to make a full investigation of the circumstances in which they came aboard. 5. Crew {which in all cases includes the Master and other Officers). —The Ship is carrying a Crew of (insert number) and these men are bona fide seamen, with the exception of (names) who has/have signed on as a super cargo/supercargoes to obtain passage to (the reference to supercargoes to be deleted if not applicable). A true copy of the Crew List has been submitted to His Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officer and has been approved by him. No changes in the crew will be made, or additional crew taken on board, after the said Ship Navicert has been granted by His Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officer unless they have his previous sanction. 6. It has been explained to me that it is a breach of the Ship Navicert regulations for me, my officers or crew, to carry goods or anything other than personal effects aboard the Ship. Personal effects may include foodstuffs and soap up to 20 kilos, per head, of which not more than 5 kilos, may consist of soap. I undertake that I will not permit any member of the Crew to carry anything other than personal effects except with the permission of His Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officer. I further undertake that I will satisfy myself before departure that nothing has been concealed on board by any member of the Crew, and to report to His Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officer before departure if any such articles are found. 7. I am fully aware that according to present British regulations the total amount of gold or silver bullion, coin, bank-notes or other paper money, postal orders or money orders, which any individual may carry on the present Voyage may not exceed the equivalent of U.S. $300, of which not more than U.S. $50 may be in U.S.A. currency or its equivalent in Sterling area currency, and that any sum carried in excess of these limits is liable to detention or seizure, I am also aware that the carriage of any of the follow ing documents is prohibited, and that such documents are liable to detention or seizure, viz.:—cheques, drafts, bills of exchange, promissory notes (other than travellers’ letters of credit or travellers’ cheques issued in the name of the person carrying them) expressed in U.S.A. or Sterling area currency, or any bonds, debentures, or any documents of title relating to stock, shares or debenture stock, warrants, coupons and vouchers whereunder any interest or dividend is payable. I have given my crew instructions to this effect and have warned them of the consequences of any contravention of the regulations. 8. Mails.—The Ship is carrying the following bags of certified Diplomatic or Official Mail:— (details to be given in each case) 9 bags of Postal Mail have been loaded at (ports to be filled in) and copies of the waybills have been produced to His Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officer granting the said Ship Navicert. These bags comprise all the postal mails carried in the Ship on the Voyage and no other postal mails of any descrip tion have been or will be loaded before the Ship proceeds to (here fill in the name of the port at which the Ship will call for control) , to which port I have undertaken to proceed, unless details of such mails and copies of the waybills accompanying them have been submitted to His Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officer, and are added to the number declared above. Further I undertake that any letters which may be written on board the Ship either by members of the crew, passengers or visitors to the Ship, and posted in the Ship’s letter box before the Ship reaches any specified port will be made available to the authorities at that port. 10. I undertake that no other documents, correspon dence, or undeclared packages of any description will be carried by me or any member of the crew for forwarding to any destination or for handing over to any person in the ports to which the Ship is proceeding. 11. I have studied the list of documents in Appendix Af which may properly be carried in the Ship’s Box and I undertake to observe these regula tions. The documents which I am carrying in the Ship’s Box have been submitted to His Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officer for approval, and I will not permit any other documents, correspondence or packages to be deposited in the Ship’s Box. *Where the Ship Navicert is applied for at a port in the British Commonwealth the designation of the issuing authority should be substituted for the words ' His Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officer.” (■This list is identical with that shown in paragraph 2 of Annex E (page 24).18 12. Bunkers. —The Ship’s average consumption of Oil/Coal is per day, and the total quantity of bunkers on board the Ship is tons Coal/Oil. The report in the Engineer’s log coincides with this statement. I consider this amount to be reasonable for the Ship’s requirements and is required for the Ship’s exclusive use.

(Signature of Passenger) (Date) (The Passenger’s signature may be witnessed either by His Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officer or an accredited representative of the Shipping Company.) Schedule A ; Schedule B. ANNEX C Master’s Undertaking for Voyages other than Transatlantic Voyages.* I Master of the S.S , (hereinafter called “ the Ship....,) ” Ship Warrant No for and on behalf of the owners (or charterers) of the vessel, Messrs in consideration of the issue of a Ship Navicert for a voyage (hereinafter called “ the Voyage ”) com mencing (date) from via (all ports of loading or bunkering to be filled in, in order of calls) to (all ports of discharge and approximate dates of arrival) , do hereby declare and undertake as follows :— 1. It has been explained to me, and I fully under stand, that as a condition of the issue of a Ship Navicert I am held responsible for the accuracy of the statements in this undertaking. 2. Cargo .—The Ship is carrying items of cargo upon the Voyage, and every item of cargo is shown on the manifest endorsed by His Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officer. No other cargo shall be loaded after the said Ship Navicert has been granted unless it has the sanction of one of His Majesty’s Consular Officers and is added to the manifest previously endorsed, and the entry duly authenticated. 3. Passengers .—(If no passengers are carried insert the word “ No ” and amend accordingly.) The Ship is carrying passengers on the Voyage. A true copy of the Passenger List has been submitted to His Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officer and has been approved by him. No other passengers will be embarked after the said Ship Navicert has been granted by His Britannic Majesty’s Officer unless they have his sanction and have been added to the said Passenger List previously endorsed. 4. I undertake to search the Ship thoroughly before departure to ensure that there are no stowaways on board, and to report to His Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officer before departure if any stowaways are found. If, in spite of my thorough search, stowa ways are found while the Vessel is at sea I undertake to make a full investigation of the circumstances in which they came aboard. 5. Crew .—The Ship is carrying a Crew of (insert number) and these men are bona fide seamen, with the exception of (names) who has/have signed on as supercargo/supercargoes to obtain passage to (the reference to supercargoes to be deleted if not applicable). A true copy of the Crew list has been submitted to His Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officer and has been approved by him. No changes in the crew will be made, or additional crew taken on board, after the said Ship Navicert has been granted by His Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officer unless they have his previous sanction. 6. It has been explained to me that it is a breach of the Ship Navicert regulations for me, my officers or crew, to carry goods or anything other than personal effects aboard the Ship. (In the case of voyages to the Navicert Area personal effects may include * Where the Ship Navicert is applied for at a port in the British Commonwealth the designation of the issuing authority should be substituted for the words “ His Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officer.” ^ I Tfoodstuffs and soap up to 20 kilos per head, of which not more than 5 kilos may consist of soap.) I under take that I will not permit any member of the crew to carry anything other than personal effects, except with the permission of His Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officer. I further undertake that I will satisfy myself before departure that nothing has been concealed on board by any member of the crew, and to report to His Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officer if any such articles are found. 7. Mails .—The Ship is carrying the following bags of certified Diplomatic or Official Mail (details to be given in each case) 8 bags of Postal Mail have been loaded at (ports to be filled in) and copies of the waybills have been produced to His Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officer granting the said Ship Navicert.* These bags comprise all the Postal mails carried in the Ship on the Voyage, and no other Postal mails of any descrip tion have or will be loaded before the Ship proceeds to (here fill in the name of the port at which the Ship will call for control) , to which port I have undertaken to proceed, unless details of such mails, and copies of the waybills accompanying them, have been submitted to his Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officer, and are added to the number declared above. Further, I undertake that any letters which may be written on board the Ship either by members of the crew, passengers or visitors to the Ship, and posted in the Ship’s letter box before the Ship reaches any specified port will be made available to the authorities at that port. 9. I undertake that no other documents, corres pondence or undeclared packages of any description will be carried by me or any member of the crew, for forwarding to any destination or for handing over to any person in the ports to which the Ship is proceeding. 10. I have studied the list of documents in Appendix Af which may properly be carried in the Ship’s Box, and I undertake to observe these regulations. The documents which I am carrying in the Ship’s Box have been submitted to His Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officer for approval, and I will not permit any other documents, correspondence or packages to be deposited in the Ship’s Box. 11. Bunkers .-—-The Ship’s average consumption of oil/coal is per day, and the total quantity of bunkers on board the Ship is tons coal/oil. The report in the Engineer’s log coincides with this statement. I consider this amount to be reasonable for the Ship’s requirements, and is required for the Ship’s exclusive use. I undertake that none will at any time be off-loaded during the Voyage, and that it will not be off-loaded at the end of the Voyage except with the authority of His Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officer at that port. 12. Ship’s Stores and Lubricating Oil \—The list of stores on board the Ship has been submitted to His Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officer and has been approved by him, and I undertake not to embark any further stores or lubricating oil during this Voyage without the approval of one of His Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officers. I declare that these stores and lubricating oil are required for the exclusive use of the Ship. I undertake not to unload any part of these stores or lubricating oil at any port of call unless with the approval of His Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officer, and not to unload any part of these stores or lubricating oil at a port of discharge unless with the approval of His Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officer. I further undertake that any articles required for the use of the owners (or charterers) on shore have been treated as freight and have been entered on the manifest, and have not been treated as Ship’s stores. 13. If the Ship does not leave port within 72 hours of the issue of the Ship Navicert, or if she sails and subsequently returns to port for any reason, I will inform His Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officer of the circumstances, and I understand that the Ship Navicert issued by him must be re-submitted for his approval. 14. If the Ship calls at any port before (here give first port of call) , I will inform His Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officer in that port of the circumstances and will furnish this docu ment and the Ship Navicert for his inspection and endorsement. 15. Upon the Ship’s arrival at (here give last port of call) I will surrender this docu ment to His Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officer in that port, and will produce a copy of the Ship’s manifest for his inspection. Furthermore, I will surrender any navicerts, export licences or other documents relating to cargo discharged at inter mediate ports to His Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officers in these ports. 16. If the Ship receives instructions while at sea to proceed to any port other than (here give first port of call) I will inform His Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officer in that port immediately upon arrival, and I will surrender this document and any navicerts, export licences, certifi cates of origin and interest, or other documents relating to items of cargo to His Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officer in that port, and I will produce a copy of the Ship’s manifest for his inspection. I certify on my honour that all my statements above are true. (Date) (Master’s signature) (H.B.M. Consular Officer’s signature) at I declare on my honour that the foregoing under taking signed by me at has been faithfully complied with in every detail. (To be signed by the Master on handing the Under taking to His Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officer at ) (Master’s signature) (Date) * In the case of Spanish or Portuguese vessels sailing respectively between Spain or Portugal and Spanish or Portuguese Possessions the remainder of this paragraph may be deleted. f This list is identical with that shown in paragraph 2 of Annex E (page 24). I The term “ lubricating oil ” as used here applies to all types of oil for the lubrication of the ship's engines and machinery.23 ANNEX D Ship’s Stores. Vessels sailing from Latin-American countries to the Navicert Area on outward and return voyages. [See paragraph 8 of Regulations.) For the guidance of H.M. Consular Officers in checking Ship’s stores lists, the following may be regarded as a reasonable estimate of the quantities of the commodities mentioned which may be carried by vessels of between 4,000 and 5,000 G.R.T. on outward and return voyages from Latin-American countries of nine weeks’ duration, though in dealing with par ticular cases some discretion may be used. If stores other than stores for the vessel itself are carried navicerts must be applied for in respect of them. [a) Foodstuffs for a vessel on a nine weeks’ voyage with crew of 36, 40, and 49 respectively :— kilos. kilos. kilos. Bacon and/or Ham 91-62 102-06 124-74 Butter 121-56 135-17 162-38 Margarine.. 18-14 20-41 24-94 Cooking Fats 18-14 20-41 24-94 Cheese 73-48 81-64 99-79 Chocolate and Sugar Con fectionery 63-05 68-94 84-36 Eggs, shell 18-14 20-41 24-94 Meat 1,102-24 1,224-721,500-05 Preserves .. 91-62 100-69 124-74 Sugar 275-33 306-18 374-67 Bread, Flour and Biscuits 1,322-69 1,469-66 1,800-33 Fish, fresh and wet salted 220-44 244-94 298-01 Fruit, dried 45-81 50-80 62-14 Fruit, canned and fresh .. 146-96 163-29 200-03 Milk, condensed .. 220-44 244-94 298-01 Potatoes .. 2,057-52 2,286-14 2,800-52 Rice, Tapioca, Sago and Semolina 54-88 61-23 74-84 Tea 36-74 40-82 49-89 Cocoa 27-21 30-39 37-19 Coffee 36-74 40-82 49-89 Split Peas.. 36-74 40-82 49-89 Dried or compressed vege tables .. 73-48 81-64 99-79 Green Peas, Lentils, Hari cot and Butter Beans.. 183-70 204-12 249-02 Suet 36-74 40-82 49-89 Cereals 73-48 81-64 99-79 (b) Goods carried as Deck and Engine Room stores vary from ship to ship. The main articles carried by a vessel for a voyage of nine weeks’ duration would be approximately as follows :— Deck Department 2 tarpaulins for fore peak, 6 ft. 4 in. by 5 ft. 4 in. 1 tarpaulin for Storeroom hatch, 6 ft. by 6 ft. 1 tarpaulin for No. 3 hatch, 20 ft. by 15 ft. 1 tarpaulin for Carpenter’s hatch, 24 ft. by 8 ft. 6 in. 1 tarpaulin for No. 6 hatch, 13 ft. 10 in. by 13 ft. 10 in. 10 bags quick drying cement. 15 bags sand. 300 hatch wedges. 8 bundles battens. 6 galvanised buckets. 6—3-in. flat paint brushes. 2 galvanised tanks, 17 in. by 30 in. by 12 in. (to store necessary subsistence in lifeboats). 1 sail for lifeboat. 200 lbs. Sal. soda. 4 pails soft oil soap—25 lbs. each. 25 gal. bed. linseed oil. 1 drum deck coating tar. 10 gals, gas proof white paint. 20 gals. std. marine buff. 6 gals, funnel paint. 1 coil marline. 1 coil spun yarn. 1 coil 2| in. sisal (old rope must be left ashore). 1 gal. varnish remover. 1 gal. denatured alcohol. 12 galvanised thimbles. 1 K-oiler—iron. 20 lbs.

(c) In checking the quantity of Paint, the Deck and Engine Room Lists should be perused, as in some cases the Engineers have their own supply, which reduces the quantity ordered by the Deck Department. The quantities given below are sufficient for a nine-weeks’ voyage Dry dock paints 30 cwts. Hull topsides 6 cwts. Red lead 4 cwts. Assorted deck paints 10 cwts. Wastage 2£ cwts. 52£ cwts. {d) When dealing with Rope the quantity can be more easily judged if the size and the number of coils are quoted, and not by weight which seems a practice now acted upon and can be most misleading. The length of a coil is 720 ft. and hauling lines 540 ft. The quantity below is reasonable for a nine weeks’ voyage :— Ropes, 6 of 3J in., 4 of 3 in., 2 of 2J in., 2 of 2 in. (in coils) 10,080 ft. Ratline .. .. .. .. 1,440 ft. 2 hauling lines . . . . 1,080 ft. 12,600 ft. (e) For any item which seems to be in excess, and for which no guiding figure has been given, local advice should be obtained, or it should be reported to London for consideration. (/) Where any stores are landed as a result of the withholding of a Ship Navicert, the goods remain at the disposal of the Company, subject to any action which may be taken by the local authorities.24 ANNEX E Documents, etc., in “ Ships’ Boxes ”, Rules In paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Regulations reference is made to the signed undertaking in duplicate required of the Master of a vessel before a Ship Navicert is issued. This undertaking guarantees, on behalf of the owner, or charterer, that beyond the declared number of mail bags loaded, or if subse quently loaded yet to be declared, no other corres pondence, documents or packages of any description will be carried by the Master or any member of the crew for forwarding to any destination, or for handing over to any person in the ports to which the ship is proceeding, other than those official documents deal ing with the ship and her cargo which are to be carried in the Ship’s Box. 2. Various cases having come to light in which unauthorised correspondence has been improperly included in Ships’ Boxes, it has become necessary to define what documents may properly be carried in a ' Ship’s Box,” in whatever form this may be maintained on board the vessel. They are :— (a) The Certificate of Registry, Load Line Certifi cate, Passenger Certificate (if passengers are carried), and Chain and Anchor Certificates. (b) Panama Canal and Suez Canal Certificates where appropriate. (c) Clearance documents, Bills of Health, etc., and certificates regarding fumigation. (d) The Crew lists (as approved by H.M. Consular Officer) and agreements. (e) The Master’s sailing instructions. (/) The Shipowners’ or Charterers’ letters to their offices or agents abroad, or, conversely, from those offices or agents to the ship owners or charterers, relating to the current voyage of the ship, its cargo, or matters concerning the current administration of their business. (g) The Ship’s copy of Bills of Lading, Cargo manifests, Stowage plans, Passenger mani fests (as approved by H.M. Consular Officer, if passengers are carried), Baggage manifests and Mail waybills. (h) Consular letters containing legalised manifests for particular ports. (i) Consignees’ mail, i.e., signed Bills of Lading, Consular invoices, or documents relating to cargo actually on board of the vessel, which the shippers desire to send by the Ship’s Box in order that they may be assured of their arriving at the port of destination along with the goods. (j) Navicerts, Export licences, Certificates of origin and interest, or Export passes, issued in respect of particular items of the cargo, or other documents issued by one of H.M. Consular Officers in respect of the voyage. (k) One set of the Master’s undertaking, with the attached documents, referred to in para graph 4 of the Ship Navicert Regulations. 3. No correspondence or letters other than those shown in the above list may be carried in the Ship’s Box, or be treated otherwise than as ordinary mail for transmission by post. Shipping Companies and Masters of vessels applying for Ship Navicerts should be warned accordingly, and informed that neglect to observe this injunction would be regarded as a breach of their undertaking. No remittance should be allowed to go with the Consignees’ mail. 4. With regard to letters and documents coming under the heads (/) and (i) in the list in paragraph 2 above, special care is necessary, and the rules set out in the following paragraphs should be observed. It should, however, be clearly understood that these rules in no way dispense with the prior fulfilment by the senders of such letters or documents of any obligations imposed in the country of origin that they should bear postage stamps duly cancelled, or be subjected in the first instance to the local censorship. Procedure at the port of origin 1 and Gibraltar 5. (i) All correspondence, letters and documents coming under the heads (/) and (i) in paragraph 2 must be submitted in open addressed envelopes to H.M. Consul (or the appropriate British authority) at the port of origin for his inspection 2 . If satisfied that those under (/) relate solely to the current voyage of the ship and its cargo or the current administration of the Company’s business, that the Consignees’ mail (i) contains no remittance, or correspondence other than that relating to cargo actually on board the vessel, and that they are not otherwise open to objection, H.M. Consul (or the appropriate British authority) should then enclose them in a large envelope or envelopes, conspicuously marked “ SHIP’S BOX MAIL ”, sealed with his official seal, and addressed to the British Consul, or Consuls, at the respective port, or ports, of destina tion, as follows :— “To His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at or on demand to any appropriate British authority in the course of the present voyage ”. # (ii) In the case of vessels outward bound from a Mediterranean port where there is no British Consul, Gibraltar will be regarded for this purpose as the port of origin, and all correspondence, letters and docu ments of the above categories must be submitted in like manner to the Contraband Control Service Officer there, who will pass them to the Chief Censor. If satisfied that they conform with the requirements ^ mentioned above, and are not otherwise open to ^ objection, the approved documents should then be similarly enclosed in a large envelope or envelopes, conspicuously marked “ SHIP’S BOX MAIL ”, officially sealed, and addressed to the British Consul, or Consuls, at the port or ports of destination as in (i) above. (iii) In the converse case of vessels proceeding from overseas by way of Gibraltar to a Mediterranean port where there is no British Consul, the sealed envelope or envelopes should be addressed as follows :— “To the Contraband Control Service Officer at Gibraltar, or on demand to any appropriate British authority in the course of the present voyage ”. (iv) In every case H.M. Consul (or the appropriate British authority) at the port of origin should prepare a list of the sealed envelopes so addressed, sign and date it, and attach it with a wax seal to the ship's manifest, in order that it may be available for pur poses of comparison and checking at any time in the course of the voyage. Procedure by British Authorities in the course of the Voyage 6. (i) The British authorities here referred to are :— At a Contraband Control Base—The Contraband Control Service Officer. Note 1 .—The term “ port of origin ” is to be read as denoting the port at which the papers are handed to the Ship’s Master for inclusion in the Ship’s Box. Note 2 .—If the vessel is destined to call at a British Censorship Station for examination this inspection need be no more than initial and of a precautionary character. Otherwise it should be thorough.25 At a British port where there is a Censorship Station but not a Contraband Control Base —The Chief Censor, or the appropriate Officer appointed by the Government of the British territory concerned. On the high seas—Any Boarding Officer of the Rxwal Navy. (ii) The appropriate British authority concerned, in the customary exercise of the right of visit and search, should in every instance demand to have produced to him all documents carried in whatever may constitute the Ship’s Box, check the sealed envelopes against the list attached to the Ship’s manifest, and ensure that all other documents carried come within the limits of the list set out in paragraoh 2 above, and in pai ticular that they include no unauthor ised correspondence or mail of any kind whatever. a (iii) After such preliminary investigation, the Contraband Control Service Officer, in conjunction with the Chief Censor at ports where there is a Censorship Station, and at other ports the Chief Censor, and elsewhere the Boarding Officer (if the IcTtei elects so to act) 3 should examine the contents of the sealed envelopes marked “ SHIP’S BOX MAIL” expeditiously but as thoroughly as circumstances permit, ana satisfy themselves that the documents enclosed therein conform strictly to the requirements postulated in paragraph 5 (i) above, and are not in any other respect open to objection. They should also report any matter of interest arising from the corres pondence in accordance with the usual procedure. (iv) Thereafter the approved documents should be re-enclosed in a large envelope or envelopes, officially sealed, marked ” SHIP’S BOX MAIL ”, and re addressed to the British Consul or Consuls at the port or ports of destination in the form indicated in paragraph 5 above. Care should be taken that they are restored to the Master of the vessel before she sails, in order that they may be available at the port or ports of destination for clearance of the cargo. The list of sealed envelopes attached to the ship’s manifest should also be amended in any way necessary, initialled and dated, so as to maintain an accurate record. Procedure at Port of Destination 7- (i) On arrival at the port or ports of destination the Master of the vessel must deliver all sealed envelopes marked “SHIP’S BOX MAIL” to the British Consul or Consuls to whom they are respec tively addressed, and in each instance produce the list attached to the ship’s manifest for his inspection. If the ship is proceeding to several ports to discharge cargo, H.M. Consul at the first port of unloading, on taking charge of the sealed envelope or envelopes addressed to him, should amend the list accordingly, and initial and date it, in order to preserve a reliable record. And similarly at other ports of discharge. (ii) Before releasing the documents in the Ship’s Box Mail to the intended recipients H.M. Consul should, as a further precautionary measure, make a final inspection of them to ensure that they contain nothing to which, in his opinion, objection might be taken. This is especially desirable in the case of vessels which have not called at a British port in the course of their voyage. 8. The strict observance of these rules should render it unnecessary to report to the Ministry of Economic Wariare correspondence which is properly carried in the Ship’s Box. H.M. Consuls (or the appropriate British authorities) at the ports of origin may refuse to allow unauthorized correspondence or documents to be carried in the Ship’s Box ; Naval Boarding Officers should remove such papers for Censorship examination ; Censors may condemn or release them under their normal practice ; and H.M. Consuls at ports of destination may, in cases of doubt, hold up papers while they refer to London for instructions. This Memorandum may be cited as the “ Ship’s Box Rules, dated 20th October, -1948”. ANNEX F Diplomatic and Official Correspondence Rules In paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Regulations reference is made to the signed undertaking in duplicate required of the Master of a vessel before a Ship Navicert is issued. This undertaking guarantees, on behalf of the owner or charterer, that beyond the declared number of mail bags loaded, or if sub sequently loaded yet to be declared, no other corre spondence, documents or packages will be carried by the vessel other than those documents carried in the Ship’s Box. In Annex E it is laid down what docu ments alone may properly be carried in a Ship’s Box and the treatment to be accorded to correspondence included therein. 2. It is, however, necessary to refer to certain correspondence of a special character, described below under the respective headings, Diplomatic Corre spondence and Official Correspondence, which call for distinctive treatment in accordance with the undermentioned conditions. Diplomatic Correspondence 3. Diplomatic Correspondence comprises all com munications of an official nature emanating from or addressed to (a) His Majesty's Foreign Office and Dominion Departments of External Affairs, (b) British (including Dominions) Diplomatic Missions or Consular Establishments in non-enemy territory, (c) foreign diplomatic representatives in British territory, (d) members and departments of the several Allied Governments established in British territory, and (e) foreign consular officers, provided that inward communications addressed to such officers bear external evidence of official provenance, and that out ward communications are addressed to official destina tions. This definition is equally applicable to com munications passing in transit through British territory or controls, to and from foreign (non-enemy) diplomatic representatives and foreign (non-enemy) consular officers in non-enemy countries or in Eire. 4. To ensure the customary privilege attaching to such communications, all correspondence of this nature should be enclosed in bags (except that when small in quantity it may be contained in an adequately wax-sealed envelope) plainly addressed to its official destination, sealed with an official seal, and accom panied by a certificate furnished by the sending authority in the terms shown in paragraph 8 (ii) below, testifying to its official character. 5. Enemy diplomatic or consular correspondence may only be carried in a ship which is calling in the first instance at a British port. Official Correspondence 6. This term is designed to cover bags containing official matter sent from (or to) (a) a British Govern ment Department to (or from) any British Official Note *. Normally it is not anticipated that the Boarding Officer will require to examine the contents of these sealed envelopes. But if he has reason to suspect any irregularity he may do so. See also Note 2 ante.(052718) 700 8/44 26 address, or (b) from (or to) a Government Department in a non-enemy country to (or from) the Governor or the Administrative Departments of an overseas possession of that country. Bags sent from one Postal Administration to another Postal Administra tion do not come within this category. 7. Such Official Correspondence must be enclosed in bags officially sealed, plainly addressed to its official destination, and accompanied by a certificate furnished by the sending authority, in the terms shown in paragraph 8 (ii) below, testifying to its official character. Procedure at the Port of Origin* 8. In dealing with cases in which Diplomatic Correspondence or Official Correspondence, as above defined, is carried by a vessel His Majesty’s Missions or Consulates should ensure that the following rules are observed :— (i) All bags, etc., containing correspondence coming under either of these heads must be specifically declared by the Master of a vessel when giving his Ship Navicert undertaking. (ii) They should be accompanied on each occasion by a certificate f in the following terms furnished by the sending authority :— “It is hereby certified that the (number) bags and (number) envelopes, as detailed below, which are being shipped from on the s.s contain nothing but official correspondence on the business of the Government. bags addressed to etc. envelopes addressed to etc. (Signature and designation of certifying officer) (Place and Date) ” (iii) The certificate should be furnished in tri plicate, and each stamped “ Seen at the British Consulate at signed, dated and sealed. One should then be attached to the Master’s undertaking for retention in the Ship’s Box, the second attached to the duplicate of the Master’s undertaking and sent to this Ministry, and the third retained by the Mission or Consulate in its records. (iv) In cases where the bags, etc., are entrusted to the care of an accredited courier, such courier should be furnished with {a) an authenticated certificate appointing him as such by a properly constituted authority of the country(s) whose bag(s) he is carry ing, (b) a certified waybill or other similar document showing the number and weight of the bags carried (accompanied) by him. ^ In this event care should be taken that the Declaration as to articles carried, which is required of passengers sailing on Transatlantic voyages to or from the Navicert Area, is, in the case of such accredited couriers, amended by the inser tion at the commencement of the para graph of that Declaration relating to correspondence and documents, of the words “ Except as regards bags and envelopes of Diplomatic (Official) correspondence entrusted to my care, which have been duly certified as such and declared before His Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officer.’’ (v) When reporting the issue of the Ship Navi cert, His Majesty’s Missions or Consulates, in addition to telegraphing the requisite details set forth in paragraph 32 of the Ship Navicert Regulations in the case of Postal mails carried, should specify sepa rately in the telegram the number of bags, etc., of Diplomatic Correspondence or Official Correspondence respectively carried and indicate their respective destinations.J This Memorandum may be cited as the “ Diplomatic^- id Official Correspondence Rules, dated June 1,1944.’ A Note *. The term “ port of origin ” is to be read as denoting the port at which the bags are shipped on board the vessel. In the case, however, of vessels outward bound from a Mediterranean port where there is no British Consul, Gibraltar is to be regarded as the port of origin for the purpose of the administration of these rules. NoTEf.-—-In the case of bags addressed to or from British or United States.Diplomatic or Official authorities, it will be sufficient if they are accompanied by a certified waybill or other similar document showing the weight and number of the bag(s). Note %—-As regards such correspondence passing between Spain or Portugal and their overseas Possessions (except Angola, Mozambique and Portuguese India) the total number of bags, etc., carried on the voyage in respect of each territorial unit (Azores, Canaries, &amp;c.) need alone be given, without specifying the particular ports to which they are addressed.1211'+'t •• Telegram From To No. 'S*.

Portugal, Spain, Turkey, Eire and Iceland, must be covered by certifi cates of origin. Tehran should note that certificates of origin for goods not on the reserved commodity list may be issued without reference home* provided there is no statutory list objection. Reference home Is required if the goods are on the reserved commodity list except in the case of Switzerland, to which country the procedure given in circular /UPfar No*8 of the 28th May applies.

Ref. sub para 2(ii) and 2(iii) ibid. We have already received 1.0. x.l. at s.76 and issued our memo to -G. 1,1. and Bapco at s.77. Presume petroleum products ex Bahrain are not shipped except by tanker. Qo K. Ref. sub para 2(iv) ibid. From para 2 of ^ s.85 it will be seen that Eire is now also among countries for which vessels do not need ship navicerts. But we seldom or never have a direct sailing from Bahrain to U.K. or Europe and it seems hardly necessary to issue letter to G.M. Enclosure is addressed to Collectors of Customs at Indian ports. V, to S.8 7. Ref. para three of p.u.c. This confirms instructions in para 4 of s.73. Our memo to G.M. at page 103 of F. 23/14. b haf covered point. The information contained in enclosure to p.u.c. has already been given us in 1.0. x.l. at s.85/,4^ and office has been observing this procedure. It has been noticed, incidentally, that we . have been granting ships navicerts indiscriminately, regardless of whether Bahrain is last port of loading in Gulf or ship is to load at other ports subsequently. Cant. Dixon's suggestion to grant ship navicerts 'up to j . and including Bahrain' is at page 46 of note sheets of F.23/14.b, but if Bandar Abbas is last port Consul there should issue ship's navicert?, and if Dubai or Sharia is last port then procedure at para 2(ii) of G of'l letter at page 63 of this file should be followed by master of ship. In these cases we should stamp manifests sent to us 'approved for shipment' as in procedure for approving bills of lading given at page 115. G.M. have got so fond of our big rubber stamp however that they insist on its being used for all their manifests and if A.P.A. agrees we may continue to humour them. \ We should be hearing from G of I soon, vide enclosure to s.3l.
