W. R# LUMtfYn\ Mr. Lumby, Please see Mr. Thomson^ reply to your note of 9th February. The question at present under discussion with M.W. T. concerns the desirability of insisting that all goods shipped from this country to the Persian Gulf Protected States must go in vessels sailing direct to the Persian Gulf. 4* Space in these vessels for goods destined for Persia and Iraq is allocated by U.K.C.C. on the basis of M.E.S.C. priority recommendations and consignments for the Arab States would presumably also need to be properly authenticated. For this purpose it has been suggested that it might be stipulated that all goods must be covered by import assistance recommendations on the lines suggested in our telegram 12416 of 1st April, 1942 to External Affairs Department (this telegram was agreed by you and was copied to your Department). The actual mechanism of any scheme offsort suggested*. ^oj^Ld need to be considered here if the M.W.T. rocomroondation were favourable and you would, of course, be consulted before any definite steps were taken. It would, for instance, be necessary to decide whether the new procedure should apply to goods shipped from or via the U.K. only, or whether consignments from the U.S.A. and possibly elsewhere (with the exception of India) should also be covered. The question of how far exchange control is linked with these matters depends, therefore, on the scope of any arrangements introduced. In the case of the U.S.A. there may be Lend-Lease ^pn cations and this aspect would naturally have to be taken into account* In© Mr* Thomson These papers deal with the proposal (arising out of an application submitted to the U.K* Exchange Control for Swiss francs to pay for watches sent to Kov/eit) to send the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf some guidance with regard to the treatment of future similar applications. The draft enclosed with the Treasury letter of February 6th is worded to cover all the Gulf States; but, for the reasons given in that letter, I think it will have to be amended to apply to.Koweit only. The passage marked X in the Treasury draft contemplates that in issuing permits of the kind in question the Political Agent should have in mind not only Exchange Control considerations but also the necessity of restricting imports in accordance with our general policy in the Middle East. Thus it may cut across proposals which I understand you are considering for the introduction of import control machinery in the Persian Gulf States. (External Department has not yet been consulted on these proposals, but I trust we shall be before any definite action is taken). I imagine that the certificate which started this correspondence was issued ad hoc at the request of the importer. If so, it does not constitute evidence that similar certificates are issued in the case of all, or even most, other imports into Koweit. Nor does the Treasury draft appear to contemplate that the machinery which it envisages will cover all imports. In these circumstances it would perhaps be best for me to tell the Treasury (if this is the casej that proposals for a comprehensive import control system in the Persian Gulf States are at present under consideration here; and to arrange with them for the draft to be revised so as to deal only with Exchange Control considerations. £ia/W?L V' - P.T.O.Shipping fP ace a £g is now so res tide ted that it is no longer possible to/M-th equanimity shipment of goods for Bombay or Karachi for transhipment to Persian Gulf destinations. This shipping aspect of U.K./P.G. trade is at present under investigation with the Ministry of Tar Tr&amp;nsport* Jt is, however, solely the shipping aspect which we are looking at and not import control machinery in the Persian Gulf States. On the latter question I should like to suggest that instead of the code proposed in your draft as a guide to exchange control authorities, Political Agents should use the grading for orders wmeh has been suggested as suitable for Afghanistan and Nepal, see External Collection 23/77 viz. Category A meaning essential, category 3 meaning that the goods should be supplied and shipped if possible. Category C meaning that no facilities are advised.Ym, a,/«- OT «Jxt..424/43 Treasury Reference E.G. •..G^JLQ— TEBASURY CHAMBERS, GREAT GEORGE STREET, LONDON, S.W.l. 6th February, 1943. Dear Luraby, Ivlany thanks for your letter of the 30th January about Kuwait. We have passed the Swiss franc application which started off this correspondence. As to guidance for the future, I have been in consulta tion with the Bank of England authorities on mechanics and we have agreed to modify the procedure a little. Please see the revised draft express letter enclosed. Bahrein can be left out of the scheme since we have for some time had arrangement*for their exchange applications to be vetted by the Indian Control through the Reserve Bank of India. The link between them is the Eastern Bank, which has offices both in Bahrein and in Bombay. We would like to leave this machinery undisturbed. Muscat has not hitherto been a member of the sterling area, and should also drop out unless you regard her as a Protected State or in treaty relations with us like Kuwait, or if for any other political reasons you would like th(H»^ to be included. Loombe is in the best geographical position to give occasional advice to these territories, but though a British banker he is at present an Iraqi Government Servant. So I have suggested in the draft letter that he Jbe consulted only through H.M. Embassy, Bagdad. Yours sincerely. 4 E.W.R.

Ify attention has been drawn to a certificate issued by the Political Agent at Koweit No. 5^5^27/4-0 dated June 15th 1942 (copy enclosed), which has been presented to the Exchange Control here in support of an application for 2,664 Swiss francs for payment of the watches to which it refers. In view of-this “'certificate and of the inconsiderable sum involved, th£j^ application has been granted. 3 # it is most important that throughout the sterling area strict econony should be exercised in regard to non-sterling currencies; in this respect Koweit/Koweit and the other Gulf States are under the sane obligation as all other jnenibers of the sterling area* To this end it would he advisable that in 'iS&amp;VUbd future si^y permits/by Political Agents in respect of the import of goods from non-sterling countries should indicate specifically that importation is allowed only subject to the requisite application for exchange being approved by the British Exchange Control authorities. If this were done, no action A could be taken on such a permit until it had been presented to the Exchange Control in London and they had approved the grant of exchange,, It Iras been suggested that it would be a useful guide to the Exchange Control if Political Agents were to adopt sane simple code to indicate the degree of essentiality of the import in question; e.g* the • v . ... „ , ^ . C* v permits might be stamped with 3 - meaning 'considered essential'&gt; R - meaning 'recommended', D - meaning 'doubtful' and N - meaning 'not recommended'.

Copy of this letter and its enclosure is being sent to the Government of India*Mr. Lumby ^ I have discussed this orally with Mr. Wade, of the Treasury. It is always very desirable that the primary engine of Exchange Control should consist of the operation of import control, since, once you allow the import of goods, it at least very embarrassing to have to refuse to let them be paid for. I agree with what is said in Mr. Wade^ letter to you, and I would suggest that the Treasury be asked to pass the present application, but that a communication should then be made to the Political Agent, Kuwait on the following lines. He might be told what is being done as regards the present application, and then be reminded of the need for economy in respect of the more important non-sterling currencies* Membership of the sterling area involves duties , n as well as privileges, and Kuwait, like other countries, must l*\ . conform to the rules of the club. It would be advisable that ^ future, any import permits signed by the Political Agent j ^should indicate specifically that importation is only allowed subject to the requisite application for exchange being approved by the British Exchange Control authorities. If this were done, no action could be taken on such a permit until it had been presented to the Exchange Control here and they had approved the grant of exchange. The Treasury, suggest that it would be a convenient arrangement if the Political Agent adopted some code of hieroglyphs to indicate to the Exchange Control here what degree of 'essentiality' . belong ed to the particular order. (For example, he might ^ for considered essential, R for recommended, D for doubtrul and N for not recommended, or something like that.) The meaning of the code would not be communicated to importers, thought in time they might be able to guess it. It would.of course, have to be coiranunicated via the India Office to the Exchange Control here. The Political Agent might be told that if he is in doubt about the detail of the working of such a system, and in particular about the grading of imports, he could usefully get into touch with Mr. Loombe at Baghdad and concert the matter with him. In that event a copy of the correspondence ought presumably to be forwarded to Mr. Loombe. Before you actually pass on any such proposition to the Political Agent, the Treasury would be glad of an opportunity to see the draft embodying it. If apy of the other small territories in the Persian Gulf neighbourhood are similarly circumstanced, it might be advisable to communicate with them on the same lines.COPT Political Agents, Kuwait. 15th June, 1942. - N 0.565 - 27/40 c B K T I F I C A T B This is to certify that there is no local objection to Messrs.

Both the two applications I have ZeZS were for Swiss francs (a particularly difficult currency for us) to pay for imports of watches (a particularly unnecessary import, at least without supporting evidence of essentiality).' I might mention that watches hive a peculiar appeal to the Arab world and that controiling their import into Iraq and Egypt is also something of a problem. , The first application for Kuwait was last July and afterO ^ reference to you* we turned it down. We now have another,for 2 ^ Swiss francs, which we would deal with similarly* u _ . that the applicants hold *a certificate from the Political E. W. R.

Otherwise x we would like to turn it down, and in any case we must take some steps to acquaint him with the need for econony in most non-sterling currencies. It wo^ 1 be all right if he issued certificates graded according to the esse, ^ality of the goods, as long as it is left to us to provide exchange or refuse it. But faced with a very summary and unqualified document like the enclosed x we do not have a very free hand. The business is admittedly most insignificant and we do not really mind if you would rather not introduce any formalities.
