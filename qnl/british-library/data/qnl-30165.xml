Dated 8 th, received 9th May 1948. SECRET. Para 10 of Chancery letter of March 24th about Continental Shelf of Persian Gulf. In our reply to State Department we propose to accept suggestion that some public announcement by ourselves and U.S, Government on general lines will be , needed. We have come to the conclusion however that if this public announcement were made as envisaged by State Department before rulers on south-western shores of Persian Gulf had made any formal assertion of sovereignty an opportunity would be afforded to Persian Government to take forestalling action and to claim continental shelf of whole of Gulf. On reflection we therefore consider and propose to suggest to State Department that as soon as H.M.G. and U.S. Govt* have settled their policy the first public action by anyone should be a declaration of sovereignty in general terms by the rulers of the south-western shores of the Persian Gulf. This would mean that we and Americans would suggest this course to Saudi and Iraqi Governments and that we should arrange for Shaikhdoms under our protection and Muscat to make general assertion of sovereignty over area of continental shelf between median line and limit of their territorial waters. We would try to persuade Saudi and Iraqi Governments to synchronize their action with that of the Sheikhdoms. H.M.G. and U.^&gt;S. / Govt2 *) Govt, could Immediately after make an announcement of their policy. 2. As far as action by Arab Sheikhdoms is concerned we think that this should take the form of a formal proclamation or law by the rulers covered by a declaration by H.J.G. that the rulers' ptoclamation is made with the full assent and approval of H.M.G. We would supply you with the necessary formula. The declarations of sovereignty would be in very general terms and fact that there are so many undefined land frontiers in the area would not matter at this stage. 3. This means that we have been obliged reluctantly not to accept the recommendation in para 4 of your despatch 448-S February 21st to Commonwealth Relations Office. Fact is that London offices of several of the Oil Companies are showing interest in continental shelf of Persian Gulf and wex are under considerable pressure to tell them on what lines we think continental shelf of Persian Gulf ought to be divided. There is thus likely to be ? competlon for concessions at a very early date and definition and public declaration of principles which HtM.G. and U.S. Govt, think should be adopted cannot be mpch longer deferred. And as stated in para 1 above we consider it would be dangerous to make a public announcement before sovereignty has been asserted by rulers of south western shores of Gulf. 4. We therefore hope that you will be able to agree to the course which we propose to suggest to State Department. 5. Ws we should like to send our reply to them as soon as possible we should be grateful for a very urgent telegraphic reply.

Your telegram No. 58 dated May 8 th. 2. Chancery letter of March 24th on Continental Shelf of Persian Gulf has not been received. 3. In view of what Is stated In paragraph 3 I have nothing more to say except that it will not be easy to make Trucial Shaikhs understand whit is required of them and that in view of their number and the distances by which they are separated the process of explaining the matter to them and getting declarations issued will take some time. Some difficulty may be experienced with the Shaikh of Bahrain who will take the opportunity of venting kx his grievances over Zubarah and the recent decision about the sea bed between Bahrain and Watar. 4. In framing the proposed formula the ownership of islands will presumably be borne in mind for instance Hulul Island which lies off Qatar is recognised as belonging to Abu Dhabi while the Tarab Islands wnich lie nearer the Persian than the Arab shore are claimed by us for Has al Khaimah. - HAY -FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.I. 24th May, 1948. (E 6276 / 276 / 91 ) SECREI. Dear Chancery, Will you please refer to your letter No. G59/-/48 of the 24th March about the principles to be adopted for the territorial division of the waters of the Persian Gulf and the exploitation of off-shore oil. We are very glad to find that in general the State Department's thinking is on the same lines as our own. In giving you our further observat ions on the State Department's preliminary views, we think it would be convenient if we referred in each c&amp;se to the para graphs as numbered in your letter. 2. Paragraph 3 of your letter presents no difficulties as the State Department agree with our view that existing concessions do not cover after acquired territory unless this is expressly provided for in the terms of the concession. 3. Your paragraph 4. Two things are Involved here, the assertion of sovereignty by the rulers over the sea-bed and sub-soil of the areas wWich would fall to their shares, and the grant of rights to exploit the oil in the sub-soil. On the first point our view is that the rulers should annex the sea-bed when they annex the sub-soil. We do not see how they can very well do one without the other. A different sovereignty over the sufface from the sub-soil is hardly tenable. As regards the second point, the Americans view ± as we understand it is that the right to exploit the sub-soil does not include a right to make any use of the sea-bed above and that nothing the oil companies do in the sub-soil must prejudice the existence of the fisheries or pearling beds on the sea-bed above it; in principle, we agree and we think that navigation rights must be similarly protected. This point will present no difficulty in the case of new concessions or in the case of those companies whose concessions do not include the continental shelf territory. In the few cases where existing concessions will Include the continental shelf after it has been annexed by the State concerned, it will, however, have to be made clear to the companies that whatever their theoretical rights they shall only exploit the sub-soil provided they reppect the sea bed above it and navigation rights in the sea. It will also probably be necessary to issue rules and regulations similar to those which we understand have been Issued by the States of Texas and LoulMana to control explo&amp;atory methods in off-shore areas v in the Gulf of Mexico and likewise something on the lines of the Trinidad Submarine Regulations for the protection of shipping, an extract from which we enclose. This is, however, a detail which can be settled at a later date.2 ■■■■■■■■ ’V 4. Your paragraph 5, We hope that the map sent with our letter No. E. 4457/276/91 of the 12th April will have been of assistance to the State Department in showing our conception of how the geographical divi^im of the sea-bed of the Persian Gulf by a median line between the North-Eastern and North-Western shore of the Gulf woold look on a map. As regards the transversal division, we feel that the most practical way would be to extend rit towards the median line the boundaries of the territorial waters between adjacent States except where this is clearly inequitable. We appreciate the necessity for some such arrangement as that suggested by the State Department to meet the difficulties of disputed land frontiers. We think, however, that it would be unwise to decide now upon a settled practice as regards sea areas corresponding to land areas in dispute, as much will obviously depend on the areas in which the oil companies show interest. In so far as the sea areas off the Trucial Coast sheikhdoms are concerned, the problem will be largely one for us to settle and we have asked the Political Resident for an appreciation ofi the possibility of an early settlement of the disputed boundaries. As regards areas in dispute between Saudi Arabia * and the Sheikhdoms under our protection, we agree with you that it would be better to have some sort of self-denying ordinance. In the case of the neutral zone between Koweit and Saudi Arabia, we do not anticiapte any difficulty as it can presumably be arranged that just as Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit hold jointly the rights over the neutral zone on land, the rights over the corresponding area of the sea-bed could be shared jointly. 5. We are glad to see from paragraph 8 of your letter that tht State Department agree with us that sovereignty over those parts of the sea-bed where it is desired to grant concessions should be asserted by the States concerned. In .the case of the Arab sheikhdoms, we think'this should take the form of a formal proclamation or x law by the ruler covered by a declaration on the part of His Majesty^ Government that the ruler's proclamation is made with the full assent and approval of His Majesty's Government. We have in mind that the ruler's proclamation should be an assertion of sovereignty in general terms over the sea-bed between the median line and the limit of territorial waters. In some cases islands be longing to one State lie nearer to the shore of another State and the proclamations would have to tkke this into account. 6 . Your paragraph 7. There is a difference of opinion between us and the State Department over the approach to Persia. We have made it clear in the first paragraph of our telegram No. 4135 of the 15th April to you that in our view acceptance of the State Department's suggestion in your paragraph 7 might result in the whole divisabn of the sea-bed on the Arab side of the Gulf being held up. We are convinced that it is essential because of the Persian claim to Bahrein that we should present the Persians with a fait accompli . Any other course would, we feel sure, lead to endless arguments and prevent us dealing with the problems which have already arisen due to the interest shown by certain oil companies in exploiting off-shore oil in on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf. We hope that the State Department will be able to agree to our views in this matter. Tehrah telegram No. 342 of the 27th April supports this view. i / 7.- 3 / 10 7* As regards the future procedure mentioned in your paragraph 9, the negotiations which certain oil companies have already started with the Saudi Arabian Government have* we feel, forced our hand over the Continental Shelf and the principles of our joint approach must clearly be settled as soon as possible. We think that any attempt to settle the disputed boundaries before we informed the rulers of the Arab States,and we and the United States Government jointly or in concert infommed the Governments of Iraq and Saudi Arabia, would hold up proceedings indefinitely. 8 . On the further question of the action to be taken once Anglo-American policy has been defined, we are of the opinion that, if His Majesty^ Government and the United States Government were to make a public accouncement as suggested, be fore the rulers concerned had made a formal assertion of sovereignty, an opportunity would be afforded to the Persian Government to take forestalling action. To prevent this we feel that the first public action should be the declaration of sovereignty by the rulers. This would mean that we and the Americans would suggest this course to the Saudi Arabians and Iraqis and that we should arrange for the Sheikhdoms under our protection and Maxtcx Muscat to make a general assertion of sovereignty over the area of the continental shelf between the median line and the limit of their territorial waters. In the case of the Trucial Sheikhs the process of explaining what is required of them and getting the required declarations issued may take some little time. We are looking into this question further but are inclined to think that some delay on their account is probably inevitable since they would in any case have to be told what was proposed for them. His Majesty’s Government and the United States Government could immediately after make an announcement of their policy in the matter. We think it is unlikely that this procedure would favour some companies more than others. In their own Interest the rulers will not grant additional concessions without giving full opportunity to all comers to make their bids. The State Department have also asked whether His Majesty’s Government have finally.adopted or are likely to adopt the principle of the Continental Shelf for sea-bed areas in general. We cannot commit ourselves to a definite assurance that we should follow this principle in all cases which might ailse in future, which are infinitely varied. Wo have, however, followed this doctrine in the two cases that have arisen in the Bahamas and Majaica and are proposing to apply it in the Western Atlantic and the Persian Gulf. For your information, we should not be able to give a more definite acceptance of the principle without consulting the Commonwealth Governments. We, of course, mean the principle as originally expressed in President Truman’s proclamation which, when property applied, has the effect of excluding from any division at all the sea-bed where the sea is is so deep that so far as can be seen at present there is no practical fceason for dividing it and not the extensions of this principle which have been put forward by various Latin-American States, extensions against which we have in most cases formally protested.G&gt; 4 &lt;* 10. On the Question of the association of Service advisers, we have kept in full consultation throughout with the Admiralty which, we consider, is the Department chiefly concerned and shall continue to do so. In fact, their hydrographer drew up the chart which we sent you. We presume that the State Department will have similarly consulted their Navy Department. 11. We should be grateful if you would discuss these comments informally with the State Department. We would like you to g telegraph the results of this discussion as if they are in general, agreement with the approach suggested in our despatch of the 4th February as modified and explained in t: is letter, it will be necessary for us, in view of the ever- increasing interest now being shewn in off-shore oil in the Persian Gulf to seek higher authority as speedily as possible for this line to be adopted as our official policy. They will no doubt wish k to do likewise. Once the British and ' American policies are settled we should hope that action on the lines of our paragraph 7 above would follow fairly speed ily unless some particular twist of the Palestine or Persian situations made it advisable to hold bacit. 12. We are sending copies of yours. of this letter to the recipients Yours ever, EASTERN DEPARTMENT. COPY . (E 4131/276/91) In the third paragraph of the Foreign Office's letter of the 30th April to Washington, mention is made of the possibility of having to issue rules and regulations to control exploration in the Persian Gulf. In this -ewtre* connection it may eventually be desirable to include the following two provisions, which appear in the Trinidad Submarine (Oil Mining) Regulations, 1946 s- (1) The Licensee shall, if called upon so to do by the Director of Surveys, erect and maintain at his own expense such survey marks or monuments as may be necessary for the delimitation of the submarine area included in the licence. Such survey marks or monuments shall be of a form and type approved by fcc the Director of Surveys. 2 ( 2 ) The Licensee shall not carry on any operation authorised by the licence in such a manner as to effect hhe closing of the marine areas specified in section 2 of the Submarine Areas of the Gulf of Paria (Annexation) Order, 1942, or any of them, and any works or installations erected by the Licensee shall be of such nature and shall be so constructed, placed, marked and buoyed as not to constitute a danger of obstruction to shipping, and the Licensee if required by the Governor to do so shall illuminate between the hours of sunset and sunrise, in a manner satisfactory to ' the Harbour Master, all derricks, piers, survey works or any other installations erected in the area included in a licence. The means of illumination shall be such as is approved h or required by the Harbour Master.SECRET His Excellency the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain, presents his compliments to:- I S. ' 1.

Moreover the assertion of sovereignty oyer the sea-bed in the present case might, in their opinion, give U s ® ^\! eri0 “ s Political complications concerning navigational rights if used as a precedent in other parts of the world. . . .?• l n the Truman declaration, the word 'sovereignty' was -“although with V mnoh d ^ and th ® WOr ?

The State Depart- ???* w ®“ ld therefore prefer that the States concerned should assert areas Allotted th ® natural resources in the'subsoil of the that %h»£o^ d k? ^ J* was P° int « d ou t to the State Department that the maim object was to prevent exploitation of the subsoil III™?**' the Persian Gulf by undesirable counties but thej t 5 at th *f r Proposal would suffice for this purpose.

The State • • •- 2 - 5. The State Department agreed with Eastern Departments comments on the second point discussed in paragraph 3 of their letter. 6 . Paragraph 4. The State Department geographer produced a map which together with an explanatory memorandum, is being sent by bag. He emphasised that it was drawn with the object of giving the divisions of the area a strictly scientific basis and that although there would no doubt have to be divergencies for political reasons from the boundaries suggested, it would be advantageous, ir dealing with the States concerned to start from some clearly logical principle. His map would, in our view, need considerable changes if it is to be acceptable to the States concerned. If his principled were adopted further information would be needed about the status of some islands, the sovereignty over which is undefined or disputed. 7. Paragraph 6 . In spite of our strong representations to the contrary the State Department still adhere to the view that it would be wiser not to face the Persian Government with a fait accompli. This would, in their view, encourage anti-British and anti-American element in Persian and would engender in the Persian Government a lack of confidence in both our Governments even if tney did not learn of our intentions in advance through a leakagei. 8 . The State Department suggest therefore that after consult* 3 tion with his British colleague, the United States Ambassador in Tehran might advise the State Department whether in his opinion it would be desirable to discuss the question privately with the Shah v on a suitable occasion. He would explain the position, say that the British and United States Governments did not desire to stir up trouble in dealing with this urgent question, and ask the Shah suggestions as to how the matter might be settled without raising political difficulties. He would point out that an orderly and rapid solution was as in the interests of Persia as of any fcther country, since the Persians could hardly wish to see Soviet concern] drilling in the Gulf. Any agitation would only help the Soviet Government to stir up trouble and the latter would have no chance of doing this if the Persian Government were prepared to acquiesce in the proposed division. If the matter were raised it could be suggested to the Shah that the Persian Government could reserve thet their 'rights” to Bahrain whilst accepting the proposals themselves, If the Shah refused to agree in spite of these arguments, he would be told that the British and American Governments intended to go ahead anyway in view of the urgency of the problem. This compromise suggestion would, in the State Departments view, ensure that the proposals were not held up whilst at the same time giving the Persian Government no excuse for saying that they had not been consulted by two supposedly friendly governments in a matter in which they had a considerable interest. 9. A similar approach could also be made by His Majesty's representative, although in the State Department's opinion it might be preferable, in view of our own interest in Bahrain and Kuwait, to leave this to the United States Ambassador who would, of course, keep in close touch with His Majesty's Embassy. Henderson hoped ti that you would be prepared to give serious consideration to his suggestions. He emphasised the State Department's concern that we should not go behind the back of the Persian Government by sayini that even if the United States Ambassador in Tehran agreed with the views so far expressed by His Majesty's Embassy there, the State Department might feel obliged to overrule him. 10. Paragraph 7. State Department agree. They think that the companies concerned might be asked to observe a self-denying ordinance in any disputed areas in which oil might exist. 11. Paragraph 8 . This is largely covered by the State Department's comments on paragraphs 5 and 6 . In their view the first public attion should be the assertion of jurisdiction by th' States concerned over the natural resources in the subsoil of thf areas allotted to them.(£\ M.) dP - 3 - - 1 ^BXXXX3iaiXXi5IMXXRiaKyiiry^1TOYliQgsxXM^gD&amp;3^KirrtT^y; yyKy¥yjp^¥y ? - 12# Paragraph 10.

(d) The assertion of sovereignty. (Paragraph 4 of the despatch). (e) Future procedure (paragraph 5 of the despatch). 3. T heir views on (a) are that existing concessions do not U ' 1 •' *“* ■ (b) they consider that there are two ways of dealing with the point. The first is to hold that only subsoU rights ar2*now in question, ignoring for the present seabed (and fishing) rights, orange for any assertion of sovereignty to relate to subsoil rights only. The second is to assert both subsoil and seabed rights, but to make any reservations which may be necessary for acquired seabed rights. They are inclined to prefer the first alternative as being simpler, with some clause indicating that sub- soil rights should not be exercised to such detriment of seabed rights as might be caused, for example, bat by drilling in pearl beds or by contamination of the waters on fishing banks by oil. If these problems were in fact to arise, arrangements might be made a d hoc for compensation to be paid. 5 \ a The X thab the conception of the median line, with the extension of land frontiers to meet it. is a sound one. Where there are disputed land frontiers it might be possible to make a neutral zone in the sea areas corresponding to the land areas in dispute, in which there could be joint rights or no rights at all These areas could be allocated when a decision is reached on the lane areas concerned. It occurs to us that, if this idea were adopted, it would be better to have no exploitation at all, rather than joint rights, since if oil were found in the sea areas, the conflict over the land frontiers would become even more acute. tent ative idea about the projection of a land frontier where the angle at which the frontier intersects the coastline is in doubt, is that it might be drawirfmt to the Median Line perpendic- uiar to the general trend of the coast at the point in question. But it was realised that this might, in practice, be difficult, and that no decision could be reached unless it could be seen how such ar 6 - 2 - u conception would look on the mat).

If so/th^y suggest that', at the moment when our two governments approach the states concerned, a press release should be issued about what is proposed, #e so that everyone would start on an equal footing, if this were delayed beyond that moment, one or other of the governments concerned would certainly tell one or other of the oil companies, an d this were done by the Saudi-Arabian Government for example, the Arabian American oil Company would start with an advantage.
