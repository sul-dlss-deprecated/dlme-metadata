Introductory. 1. Basidu is situated on the westernmost point of the island of Kishm, which is separated from the south Persian coast, to which it runs parallel, by Clarence Strait. It lies about 25 miles E. by N. of Lingah town on that coast. It has a reasonably good anchorage for vessels of moderate draught, about a quarter of a mile from the shore. The place is one of the healthiest Lor. n, 267 . near the entrance to the Gulf; while the island of Kishm, on which it is situated, was described in 1902 by Rear-Admiral Bosanquet as “in my opinion the most important strategical position in the Persian Gulf from a naval point of view ...” For landing purposes there was stated in 1906 to be a jetty extending to low-water mark. There is a cemetery containing Indian Navy graves, which is maintained in good order and the upkeep of which is a point which will call for consideration should the concession revert to Persia. Extent of the British Concession. 2. The extent of the British concession in Basidu was the subject of investigation in 1901. Difficulty was experienced in defining its limits, but the Government of India, after examination of the reports of the Political Resident and the available records, expressed the view that “ whatever may have been the original limits of the tract granted to the British Government in 1820, as to which there appears to be no information readily available, they are debarred from asserting a claim over Old Bassidore [a village in close proximity to the old Portuguese fort which once existed upon the north-west extremity of the island of Kishm, and which, with the village of Bandar Singau, situated also in close proximity to the Portuguese fort, was formerly regarded as within the limits of the British station] by the prescription of man} 7 years. The site of the abandoned settlement at Singow may, however, be regarded as included within the limits of the British Station.” Status of Basidu. 3. The British concession in Kishm was obtained in 1820 by a written grant from the Imam of Muscat, in whom effective control of the island was then vested. The international and legal position of that concession turns on whether this grant was made by the Imam as sovereign of Kishm, and so of Basidu, or as tenant of Kishm from Persia. 4. From the records in the possession of the Government of India it would appear that from the middle of the I8th century until about 1800 Kishm was farmed by Arab tribes from the Persian sovereign, to whom they paid tribute ; that at the beginning of the last century the islands and Bunder Abbas came under tbe control of the Imam of Muscat, who, however, continued to pay rent to Persia in respect of them ; that the officers of the Imam were, however, reported in 1821 to have stated that neither Kishm, Ormuz nor Larak were specified on the receipts annually granted by the Persian Government for the stipulated sum paid ; and that tbe Muscat Government claimed at the same period that the islands in question belonged exclusively to them. 5. In 1799-1801 endeavours were made by His Majesty’s Government to Precis, p. 35, p. 37(18), secure a lease of the island of Kishm from Persia, whose sovereignty was not apparently at the time regarded as doubtful. The active British association with the island, which, as stated above, dates from 1820, originated in the transfer to it in that year of the British military detachment previously stationed at Ras-al-Khaima. The British settlement on Kishm took place with the consent of the Imam of Muscat, who, in his letter on the subject to the Government of Bombay, remarked of Kishm that “ The island in question and all other territories appertaining to me and subject to my authority appertain also to the Honourable Company, and I do not 3099 75 10.28 a p. 43 iv (2).

Precis, pp. 14, 16. p. 18. reckon those dominions as appertaining to me but as appertaining to the Honourable Company.” The Imam simultaneously instructed the Sheikh of Kishm to give every assistance in the embarkation and conveyance of the troops. Various places were occupied in the island for the purpose in question, before a decision was finally taken in favour of Basidu in 1822. 6. An immediate protest in strong terms was received from the Persian Government against the British occupation of Kishm, and a reference to the lease granted by the Imam was met by a statement that Muscat was itself a dependency of Persia, and a fortiori Kishm and Henjam, which depended from Bunder Abbas * Sooner than risk a rupture of friendly relations with Persia, it was decided to remove the British detachment from the town of Kishm. This was done in February 1S22, but the Government, of Bombay, in their letter repudiating the unauthorised agreement which had been entered into by Captain Bruce with the Prince Governor of Fars, which had inter alia recognised Persian sovereignty in Kishm, made it clear to the Persian Government that their action was without prejudice to the decision on the question of the respective rights in the island of the Imam of Muscat, and of Persia, and that the island would be restored by His Majesty’s Government to the Imam, from whom they had leased it. As, however, no equally convenient naval station could be found in the Gulf, Basidu was again occupied in 1823, from which year until 1879 it remained the head quarters of the naval squadron in the Gulf. No protest appears at the time to have been made by Persia against its re-occupation, since the date of which the British flag has flown in the concession. 7. In 1853 the Persian Government expelled the Muscat representative from Bunder Abbas and its dependencies (including apparently Kishm), and the agreement finally reached between Persia and Muscat in 1850 involved not only the payment of an increased rent to Persia by the Sultan of Muscat, but the recognition as Persian territory “of the two islands of Ormuz and Kishm, which had been dependencies of Oman.” 8. During the Anglo-Persian War of 1855 Basidu was constantly used as a British depot, but neither in 1853, 1856, 1864 (when the British occupation was confirmed under Article 6 of the Telegraph Agreement with Sultan Thoweymee of Muscat,t then lessee of the island from Persia), on the renewal of the Persian lease to Muscat in 1868, or on the forcible termination of that lease in the same year by Persia, was any exception taken by Persia to the British occupation. 9. The legal position of Basidu, which had been raised in 1863 by a claim from the Persian authorities, which would appear to have been rejected, for the surrender of a slave who had taken refuge in the concession, was again raised by a similar demand in the spring of 1868, and by a murder committed in the same year in the Naval Station. 10. The question was exhaustively considered by the Government of India, who as a result, on 8th September 1868, informed the Government of Bombay that in their opinion “the station in question cannot properly be considered as British territory. It is perfectly true that we have occupied Basidu either as a naval or coaling station for half a century. But the island has always been treated by us as a dependency of Bunder Abbas ; and Bunder Abbas and its dependencies, including the island of Kishm, and consequently Basidu, have been leased to the Sultan of Muscat by the Shah of Persia under circumstances with which the Government of Bombay is perfectly familiar. ... It follows in such circumstances ... as the British Government holds possession of the town of Basidu by permission of the Sultan of Muscat, while that potentate derives his lease of Kishm, which includes Basidu, from the Shah of Persia . . . that Kishm must still be considered as Persian territory. There may be some obscurity as to the exact nature of our derivative title to the town of Basidu, and it may have been thought that our rights over the town existed by continued usage, or that we had obtained a prescriptive title ; but, in looking closely into the question, it becomes evident that our rights are subordinate to those of Muscat, which again are, admittedly, entirely subordinate to those of Persia, and have58 For. Pol.. Oct. 28 1875. Lor. i. 2107-8. been always so treated up to this very hour.” The Government of India, in adding that arrangements should be made to establish a local jurisdiction for petty criminal cases, remarked, “The official holding the trial at Basidu would, in the eye of the law, be merely using the delegated authority of Persia and Muscat.” 11. The opinion as to the status of Basidu expressed in 1868 by the Government of India, and quoted in the preceding paragraph, has since held the field, and was maintained by them in 1875 in connection with the * India letter 2 os, proposed Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council. 0 12. In 1878 the Political Resident in the Gulf urged that the grant of 1820 by the Sultan of Muscat and its renewal by his successor in 1861, taken with “such prescriptive right as an undistributed possession of nearly 60 years may be held to confer, constitute our title to possession ... I Precis, pp. 19-20. think it might fairly be urged that the Persian Government have been fully aware all these years of our assumption of the prerogatives of possession at Basidu and have by silence acquiesced.” 1868—1926. 13. The surrender to Persia of the British concession at Basidu, in return for a corresponding concession at Henjam, and the transfer of the naval station in the Gulf to the latter island, was considered in 1866-8, but was not ]ti) 20 _ 2 pursued. In 1878 the infantry detachment which had been maintained in the L or . j ) 210S-9. ■concession for the protection of the coal depot was reduced from a company to a havildar guard, which was itself withdrawn in 1883. No detachment has since then been stationed at Basidu. In the same year the subordinate non-European stall were withdrawn, and the station placed in charge of a coal agent under the ultimate control of the Bushire Residency. Some concern was caused in 1899 by rumours of designs on Kishm by Russia, which, however, proved unfounded, and in 1901 the Government of India instructed! the Political Resident that “ no official of the Persian Government can be permitted to reside in any part of the station at Basidu without the express consent of the British Government.” 14. The question of reasserting British claims at Basidu in connection w r ith the extension of British influence in the Gulf was considered, and a decision in favour of action to this end taken, by an inter-Departmental conference in 1902, but, probably consequent on the decision of His Majesty’s Government in 1903-4 that Henjam offered greater advantages as a site for a telegraph station, no action appears to have resulted. A further recommendation as to the consolidation of the British position at the entrance to the Persian Gulf, including Kishm, was made at an inter- Departmental conference in connection with the Baghdad Railway in 1907, but again apparently without result. 15. In 1905 a request by the Moin-ut-Tujjar for permission to store red ochre in the British concession was refused, and in the same year the coal agent was instructed by the Resident to warn a Persian Customs officer who had interfered in the territory of the concession that “ he has no business in British territory, and if he persists he should not be allowed to come within British territory.” 16. No fresh consignment of coal was landed after 1911; the coaling station was unobtrusively transferred to Henjam in 1913 ; a proposal to abandon the concession, on grounds of economy, was dropped, apparently for political reasons, in 1923. v - , ' ::: ' Since 1913 the concession has been maintained on political grounds only, its cost from the 1st April 1927 having fallen on Indian political funds.§ A nominal coal depot and the coal agent are. however, maintained to this day, the British flag is constantly flown,|j and the circuit house is kept up.^| p. 76. t Lr. to Pol.

The Air Ministry, having in July 1921 raised the question of establishing a seaplane base at Basidu, were relented b} the 1 oreign Office to the opinion expressed by the Government of India, and informed that Basidu was retained “mainly as a possible asset in negotiations with the Persian Governmentthat the British position in it was extremely weak, and that there would be the strongest political objection to their proposal.^ 21. The possibility of an arrangement with Persia in respect of Henjam on the basis of surrender of Basidu was touched on in unofficial discussion between Sir L. Haworth and the Belgian Director-General of Customs in September 1927, and was well received; but the matter was not pursued. Incident of August—September 1928. 22. There were no further developments till August 1928, when the Senior Naval Officer in the Gulf reported that the Persian Customs official in Persian Basidu, who had previously told the British caretaker that Persian troops would occupy British Basidu in a few weeks, claimed the right, under instructions from liundar Abbas, to collect taxes in British Basidu, in which, he said, the British flag had no more significance than a consular flag. 23. The Political Resident requested the Senior Naval Officer to keep a ship off Basidu, and, should Persia attempt to occupy the concession, state that this could not be permitted without the orders of His Majesty’s Government. The Government of India, who were seriously disturbed by the Persian threat, which was closely followed by an attempt by the Persian Customs Mudir, which was prevented by the Captain of H.M.S. Lupin, to arrest a man within the concession, urged that His Majesty’s Government should either— (а) warn Persia that any molestation of British Basidu 'would be regarded as an unfriendly act ; or (б) send a small landing party to remain in Basidu until the situation cleared. 24. The Foreign Office saw objection to the first alternative, which they thought likely to provoke a definite challenge by Persia, as did the Charge d’Affaires, Teheran. As regards the second, they were not prepared to take any action which might lead to an incident at Basidu, and so could not agree to the landing of a party save with orders to withdraw under protest if challenged. To action on these lines the Admiralty, with whom the India Office agreed, saw strong objection. The India Office suggested in the circumstances reversion to action on the lines taken by Sir L. Haworth as described in para. 23 above.5 S9 25. The situation was changed by information that the Persian Director Tei. from Pol. Hew. of Customs at Bandar Al)bas, who (he alleged on orders from Tehran) £^i^sv-pt 0 ^ 1 ,'’ refused to recognise the British flag in Basidu. was intending to proceed p.495’4. thither with a gunboat on 11th September to make an arrest. The Charge d’Affaires at Tehran was immediately instructed to make representations to p' 4974 ’ Kept ' 11 ’ the Central Customs authorities, and, if necessary, to warn the Persian Government that any molestation of British Basidu, “ which has been British station for 100 years, would be a complete negation of Minister of Court’s promise to Sir R. Clive.” The Senior Naval Officer was simultaneously instructed that, as the landing of armed Persians in Basidu Adm. t« s.n.o., would be an infringement of the agreement entered into with the Persian Sept - 11 ’ p * 494,1 Government, it should, as a last resort, be resisted by force, and that, while conflict with the Persians was to be avoided if possible, protection was to be afforded to British subjects at Basidu, and the British flag was not to . be hauled down. The Senior Naval Officer was instructed, however, that, if the man required by the Persians was not a British subject, and the reason for his arrest in British Basidu appeared sufficient, he should himself take steps to arrest him and hand him over to the Persians. 26. It transpired that the individual whom the Persian Government desired to arrest was the British caretaker, Hussein (whose nationality, it may be remarked, is not clear). The naval precautions taken, coupled Po, | R&lt; T 8 of s - with the representations made at Tehran, secured, however, the desired sept.W. p. 5249. result. The Customs official arrived at Basidu on the 19th September, and informed the Commanding Officer of the Cyclamen that he had orders that since the agreement with Persia of 10th May 1928 (i.e. the conclusion of the first stage of the general negotiations, in the course of which, however, no reference was made to Basidu), Basidu had ceased to be British. The Commanding Officer replied that the status of British Basidu was to be considered in the autumn, and that till then no Persian armed forces would be permitted to enter the area. The Customs official appears to have accepted the situation, and agreed that there should be no attempt at Customs interference, landing of troops or making of arrests. The Charge d’Affaires at Tehran was about the same time informed by the Teh.tei. to f.o., Administrator-General of Customs that the Belgian Director had issued p '509V. 1 151 formal instructions to subordinate posts that they were to avoid sending armed vessels with armed landing parties to any of the islands, while the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, who expressed entire ignorance of the matter, agreed that “ nothing will be done in regard to islands in Gulf to change stains quo pending result of Customs conversations this autumn.” There have been no subsequent developments ; but the naval precautions taken by His Majesty’s ships at Basidu are being maintained. Summary. 27. The legal position in regard to Basidu is concisely set out in para. 10 above. The station cannot be regarded as British territory, and an absolute claim to the concession, in the face of a desire on the part of Persia to resume it, cannot be maintained by His Majesty’s Government. On the other hand, His Majesty’s Government have occupied the concession without protest for over a century (1822-1928), and, while they cannot be held by mere occupation to have acquired sovereign rights, undisturbed and unquestioned possession for so long a period would ordinarily be regarded as giving a very strong prescriptive right to continue occupancy on the terms on which the occupation had hitherto proceeded. 28. The station at Basidu has for the last few years been retained to a small extent because of its possible value to the Admiralty for coaling purposes, but primarily for political reasons, and with the object of using it as a pawn in negotiations with Persia, whether of a general character, or immediately directed to the consolidation of the position in Henjam of His Majesty’s Government. The abrupt revival of the Persian claim makes it unlikely, however, that this counter will prove as valuable to His Majesty’s Government for bargaining purposes as was at one time hoped. 3099 BTel. from Viceroy, Aur. 22 1928, P. 4559.

Views of the Government of India. 30. The Government of India consider that as the rights in Basidu of His Majesty’s Government derive from the Imam of Muscat in his capacity as tenant under Persia, their derivation can hardly be claimed by itself to substantiate British ownership. But. the unchallenged occupation of Basidu has lasted over a century, and while materially the station is now of little or no use, politically “ it is obviously a valuable counter,^ for possession unchallenged for a whole century is not easily shaken. ^ hatever its future, however, “ we shall have to stipulate that our Indian l\avy cemetery and British graves there are properly preserved.” To the moving of the coal depot (which, as explained in para. 10,^ has had a nominal existence only since 1912) they see no 'prima facie objection.
