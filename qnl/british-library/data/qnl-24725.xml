Offence which Bahrain Police accuse American in custody is under S.381 half 762 I.P.C. which is triable by Court of Session or Magistrate of first or second class. Empha sis placed on value to Americans of Sessions Court procedure in your telegram No. 970 dated 22nd April and connected corres pondence would indicate that prolonged procedure of commitment by magistrate (Assistant Political Agent) and trial by myself as Sessions Court (with assessors) should be adopted. My view is that I should try case as District Magistrate since power to impose sentence up to two years under Section 34-A(b) Criminal procedure Code is ample to deal with accused if convicted. As one American and one Canadian in custody and cannot find bail should be grateful if you could telegraph agreement with this view as soon as possible. 3. I informed all those accused today of their right to have pleader under S. 340 Criminal Procedure Code and while regretting that no pleader was available they waived right in order to be able to be brought to trial quickly. 4. American Vice-Consul, Dhahran, here today on ordinary business saw American accused at their request and with ray consent. Vice-Consul proposes to attend trial. 5.

Convicts sentenced to long terms are usually sent to India. The most recent case was of the two convicts sentenced for trying to attempt the life of Haji Salman, Reis-al-Police. The necessary police escort for taking them away to India was sent for from India. The T. A. of the escort was defrayed by the Bahrain State . But the Indian Tail authorities have not asked for their upkeep so far. In the case of the convict in the murderous attack on Sub. Niaz All, the death sentence was executed in Bahrain. There are instances previous to this in which Indian jail authorities asked us to remit the upkeep of certain prisoners sent to India and such charges we have been, in every case, recovering from the Bahrain State. A few instances are submitued. In connection with the prisoners now referred to by the Adviser, there is still a Sessions case pending for you to deal with for which the pxlxaHJK presence of these accused will be required.umez* BY AIR MAIL Confidential Very Urgent From To No.8900/34~A.

I am therefore to request that you will be so good as to specify the classification of the prisoner Mr.Charles Minnick to enable this Government to £reat him accordingly. 2. T am to add that the dates of conviction of Mr.Charles Minnick viz. .^h July 1945 and of issue of the warrant of committal against him (viz. 26th August 1945) being different, it is presumed that the commencement of the year is to be calculated with effect fr L.e. 4th July 1945* This presumption For Chief Secret ?mbay Pblitica y* * I Copy of a letter from the Consul General for the United States of America at Bombay No.310-GDL-ace.,dated the 5 th October 1945. I refer to the recent visit of Consul LaMont of my office to Mr.Charles Elwood Minnick,Jr.,an American citizen serving a sentence in the Yeravda Central Prison, Poona, as a result of conviction of theft by the Government of Bahrein. Mr.Minnick requests that his status be changed from 'B' class, in which he has been placed provisionally, to n A n class. The class of his confinement was omitted from the warrant of commit tal in his case, and it would be appreciated if the change in his status could be arranged as soon as possible. Mr.Minrick also complains that the food given him at the prison is not suitable for a European and in this connection he alleges that he has lost 46 |iiai pounds in weight since his arrest, six pounds of which have been lost since his arrival in the Yeravda Central Prison. If Mr.Minnick is to be confined to a prison in India, it is believed that he should be given food to which he is accustomed and in appropriate -quantities. It would be appreciated if this ' could be arranged, and I would also appreciate a copy of a typical day f s menu of the food served to him. It should be pointed out that Mr.Minnick is not accustomed to Indian food and his health may be seriously endangered unless prompt steps are taken to elnsure that his diet is appropriate to his needs. Mr.Minnick believes that there was considerable irregularity in v^is conviction and it is understood that the local courts have no jurisdictionin his case. If he wishes to have his con viction reviewed, information would be appreciated as to what authority such a request should be directed. This is a question upon which I must report fully to the Department of State at Washington and I should appreciate your comment on the matter at the earliest possible date.£ _ From To Ko*8900/34-A.

In this connection I confirm thcit feeding arrange ments for Hlnnick were in the hands of the Bahrain Petroleum Co., and consisted of two meals per day, one at 9 A.II. and one at 4 P.M. The meals served^from the Company’s regular menu for its European personnel and consists generally as under:- ' 1 Tin Juice (Tomato, Orange or Lime). Hot or Dry Cereal. Fried Eggs or Omelette. Bacon or Ham or Sausages, or Hashed Corned Beef. Hot Cakes. Toast. Butter. Jam or Syrup. 1 Thermos Flask Coffee (l-Callon size) 1 Thermos Flask Water (1-Gallon size) Hot Soup. Hot Meat Dish and Vegetables. Cold Meat and Salad.'' pudding. Bread - Cheese. 1 Thermos Flask Coffee (1-Gallon size) . 1 Thermos Flasi-c Water (1-Gallon size) . ihere are no hard and fast medical arrangements for prisoners of this nature, but a Doctor is always available when required. I am informed by the Superintendent of the State • Police that he had asned Minnick if he wished to see a Doctor and the reply was in the negative. I can see no reason why the loss of 40 lbs. in weight by Minnick could be attributed to his stay here, it is of coursejalways possible that due to his mental state he may have lost a certain amount. The accommodation provided for Minnick was identical to that now used by the British Police Detachment of the State Police - an ordinary bedroom with lights and fans and he had the use of a modern bedroom. This type of accommodation is again in use for a European prisoner, and may be taken as the usual. Lt. Colonel A.C. Galloway, O.3.E., H. 13. M T s Political Agent, Bahrain.D.O.

I note chat he was provided with BAPCO water. 3. The medical officer does not regularly attend the jail, but he is always available if required. Minnick was actually asked if he wished to see a doctor and replied that he did not. 4. I have visited the jail and consider that the accommodation is, in fact, not severe enough for it consists of a furnished room as provided for the British Police Detachment together with a ceiling fan and electric lights. The sanitary and bathing arrangements are modern, and the exercise ground is a pleasant garden. 5.

Hart in a recent visit intimated that the American Consul-General, Bombay, was interesting himself very closely in a petition from Minnick in which ic is stated (a) that he was not given a fair sxat trial because he had not received benefic of legal advice, (b) that the prosecution was based on evidence of men convicted themselves at past dates. He complained also of (c) losing weight (40 lbs.) here, and (d) in Indian prison where his health was being permanently impaired. (e) the charge brought against MinnicK by BAPCO could be withdrawn, (f) if at this stage there is any machinery to obtain a remission of sentence, and (g) if he might be given a copy of tbe judgement. convey the impression that he was in sympathy with the petition because he understood that the trial had been conducted with scrupulous fairness. He only wanted material for reply to Bombay. 5. I replied to (a) in the terms of paragraph 3 of Bahrein telegram No.373 dated 18th June adding that Minnies had stated that he did not wish to appeal, vide Bahrain telegram No.463 of the 15th August; (b) that the convict should have thought of this before; as regards (c) please see my letter No. C/1112 of the 9th December of which facts Hart had like information from BAPCO and agreed with my views. As regards (d) this is mainly Government of India matter but Bahrein Agency is interested for obvious reasons. As regards (e) I pointed out that the case was Bahrein State versus Minnick. Hart agreed that to consider the question of withdrawal or revision was out of the question. The United States Bombay Consul can have recourse to the codes in Bombay, 3 The Consul General asKed Hart to enquire if 4 Hart made it clear that he did not wish to /and I see\ and I see no reason to assist in obtaining a review. As regards (g) I replied that we had already written to the Dhahran Vice-Consulate on the matter and asked Mr. Hart to write to me if he wished to re-raise it. If the letter arrives I shall refer to you for instructions for reply. 6. Hart said that he understood that Minnick had not engaged counsel as he did not wish to pay fees and that he was endeavouring now to alleviate punishment and make trouble free of cost to himself.

I again pointed out that the code was available in Bombay but because of this very fact, and to avoid giving the impression of not co-operating with him, I informed him of the terms of the Code of Criminal pro cedure 404 Note 2 last sentence, and said that if the convict preferred an appeal under this ruling it would be considered on its merits. 3. With reference to the question of loss of weight, Hart informed me that Mlnnlck's medical certificate given at the time of his engagement in the United States of America stated his condition to be normal and his weight 170 lbs. medical authorities gave Minnick»s weight as 164 lbs. on admission and his present weight as 158 lbs. Minnick, therefore, has lost 6 lbs. normal weight between the time of his employment in the States and his arrival at Yerwada. The loss may be attributable to many causes but having regard to the diet provided - and paid for - by BAPCO the views expressed in paragraph 5 of my Demi- Official letter No. C/1112, dated the 9th of December, 1945, hold good. 2 With reference to my 3(f) he again According to Hart the Yerwada prison Sd./- A.C.

I have the honour to bring to your attention the case of Charles Elwood Minnick, Jr. t an American citizen now serving a term of imprisonment in the Yervda Central Prison at Poona. The Mission has received a communication from the American Consulate General at Bombay regarding the conditions of Mr. Mirmick’s imprisonment, in wfcnch it is requested that certain details be communicated to the Government of India. 2. Mr. Minnick was convicted, on a charge of theft, to one year’s simple imprisonment in India by the British Political Agent sitting as Judge of Sessions at Bahrein Island. The prisoner alleges tii t there was some irregularity in the conduct of the trial inasmuch as he was not provided with defence counsel. 3. It is understanding of the Consulate C| General at Bombay that a warrant of commitment should specify the classification of a convicted persons* imprisonment and that Ifc; Europeans are customarily classified as Class 'A' prisoners. The p risoner was committed to jail as a Class 'B' prisoner, although the warrant of commitment did not specify his classification. 4. An officer of the Consulate General interviewed the prisoner at Poona and reports that the prisoner complaine bitterly abou thfc rations which heis receiving He maintains that they arenot fit or adequate, according to European standards, to maintain a reasonably good state of health, and states that he has lost 5P pounds in weight since the date of is conviction. The consular officer confirms that the prisoner has obviously lost a great deal of weight* 5. In the circumstances, I should be most grateful were an investigation to be made regarding the foregoing allegations with a view to ascertaining whether Mr. dnmck was in fact convicted under due process of law, and with a view to mitigating the conditions of his imprisonment. ■f KgCopy of telegram dated the 5th December 1945 from Government t 'of n Bombay?* 1 ^ t0 ^ Chief to the@) U U ? lea ? e F e C?, r correspondence with Political A«*nt Bahrain about CHAPLES MTRNTCK American subject serving sentence in Yeravda prison.

In so far as the conduct of the trial le concerned, the Government of India understand that Mr. Minniek vfia Informed of hi a right under the code of criminal Procedure to be defended by a pleader but that he waived this right. The code does not recutre that an accused person should be provided with defence eoixiael by the Court and the sugges tion that some irregularity occurred is therefore based on a misunderstanding. It may also be stated that Mr. Mlnnlck did not wish to appeal against his conviction and sentence. 3 . As regards the treatment cl the prisoner in gpol, I am to explain that prisonera f wmtlM*r Europeans or otherwise, who are convicted of offences involving moral turpitude, such as theft, cannot be placed in Class ’A 9 , and that in point of fact there is no difference in the scale cf diet prescribed for dase f A 9 and Clase •B* prisoners.

THE ABOVE MENTIONED PETITIONER DO HEROBY HUMBLY PETITION AS FOLLOWS: 1. The Petitioner, an American by birth,nationality and an American^citizen has been convitted by the Court of Sessions at Bahrein Island under Sec.381 I.P.C. and sentenced to undergo one year’s imprisonment. 2. The Petitioner submits that the Court of Sessions has no power as abdurt of original jurisdiction to try and convict the accused unless the same has been committe d to it for trial.. 3. The Petitioner being an American by birth and nationalitv and being an American by citizenship had a right to be tried by an American jury or a jury approved by him, and had furthermore a right to be defended by such counsel as he chose. The learned sessions Court had not conceded any of these o^dinarv and elementary rights. ‘ y 4. The learned Sessions Judge is wrong in holding that because t■^e prosecution also had not the assistance of a lawyer there fore the defence need not complain about his hardship. The prosecution^ story is disclosed in the complaint and needs no yer. It is only the defence that does need any legal heir) ani particularly in the case of the accused who being a foreigner must be deemed to be an utter stranger to the technicalities and abstruse procedure of Indian laws. 5 . The Petitioner had claimed that he was an American and had submitted his claim within the meaning of sec.528-A of the Cr.P.C. but the claim, without any i nquiry into its correctness was rejected. The Ifetitioner submits that t&gt;is procedure is arbitrary as it has violated the fundamental rights conceded by the code to Americans 3 6. The disparity between the facts of tfe case and law becomes still more griev^onsly apparent on an examination of the charge against the petitioner. Thafcharge was not proved to hav« come rithin the perview of the Section and the evidpnc« was woefully lacking in that respect. The confession of the Petitioner has no signi;icance when the learned Judge proceeded to take evidence despite the confession. 7. The Petitioner further submits that he has been committed bv a warrant which is ab initio invalid and his detention in custody illegal. The Petitioner has been confined in .T ail by a warrant not signed by the Court passing the sentence. submits violets the provisions of Section 3«3 of the Cr.P.C.and creates an incurable illegality which goes to the bottom of his continuation in Prison. 8. The Petitioner submits that under the circumstances his detention in Prison is unjustified and illegal.

With regard to the Case No.1 cited by the Adviser it does not seem from the file herewith if the Bahrain Govt, defrayed the cost of passages etc. of the escort, but from page 74 it woiald appear that they did cU-eTbear such expenses on previous occasions. Please return the file when done with. 3. The I.A. tells me that the papers concerning the case No.2 were destroyed by order of the then P.A. 4. It might be interesting to know that the B.G. paid the cost of passage in a later case in 1933 (Criminal case N 0 .195 of 1938 - Accused Salim iuddin who was sentenced to 7 years rigorous imprisonment for attempted murder on Mr. V/.B.Steele. 7 ltd.

The Petitioner being an American by birth and nationality and being an American by citizenship had a right to be tried by an American jury or a jury approved by him, and had furthermore a right to be defended by such counsel as he chose. The learned sessions court had not conceded any of these ordinary and ele mentary rights. 4. - The learned Sessions judge is wrong in holding that because the Prosecution also had not the assistance of a lawyer therefore the defence need not complain about his hardship. ■^he prosecution story is disclosed in .the complaint and needs no lawyer. It is only the defence that does need any legal help and particularly in the case of the accused who being a foreigner must be deemed to be an utter stranger to the techni calities and abstruse procedure of Indian lav/s. 5. The Petitioner had claimed that he was an American and had submitted his claim within the meaning of sec.528-A of the Cr. P.C. but the claim, without any inquiry into its correctness , was rejected. The Petitioner submits that this procedure is arbitrary as it has violated the fundamental rights conceded by the code to Americans. 6. The disparity between the facts of the case and law becomes still more grievously apparent on an examination of the charge against the petitioner. The charge was not proved to have come within the purview of the Section and the evidence was woefully lacking in that respect. The confession of the Petitioner has no significance when thelearned Judge proceeded to take evidence despite the confession. 7. The Petitioner further submits that he has been committed by a Warrant which is ab initio invalid and his detention in custody illegal. The Petitioner has been confined in Jail by a Warrant not signed by the Court passing the sentence. This the Petitioner submits violates the provisions of Section 383 of the Cr. P.C. and creates an incurably illegality which goes to the bottom of his continuation in prison. trate and Sessions Judge, Bahrein Island, ) Persian Gulf. ) Re; Sec.491 Cr. P.C.
