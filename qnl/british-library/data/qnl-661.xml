Aa regarda the apecific pointa referred to in the Baatern Gulf Oil Coiapany'a letter of the 24th of October, 1 am to make the following obaervationa:- (1) Hawing regard to the oonaid erationa referred to in^ the s©Tenth paragraph of the Baetem Gulf Oil Corapany'e letter of the 24th of October, Hie Majesty's Oowerraaent are prepared to recognise the right of the Company to hare a woice in the deaignation and election of the British member of the Board of Direotora, and to agree that condition (b), referred to in paragraph 1 of Colonial Office letterof the 16th of September laet should be amended to read aa followa:* «{b) That of the fiwe Directors of the Company one Director ahall at all timea be a British subject who shall be pereons grata to His Uaj eaty'a^ajMty's QoT9mm«nt. His 0election for a-ppointr.ent as Director shall toe «ad« in cona'Jltation with Majesty's Ooverissent, and Ma salary ae Director shall be provided by the Ceapany' . (S) His Kajenty'e aoTsrnossnt do net regard the proposed addition to condition (o) as entirely satiofaotory. They would, however, he prepared to agr«c to the addition suggested oy the lastern aulf Oil Company subjeet to the addition of the following furtherprovlso - 'Provided also that any sooner deteraination of the appointment Major Holaes shall be aubjeot to the consent of His Majesty's ^ovarment, which shall not be unreasonably withheld'. (3) If the Sastern Oulf Oil Coapany aro premred to agree to the two auaendaents suggested above. His Majesty's Sovemsjent will be prepared to advise the Sheikh of Bahrein to extend to the 2nd of 3«eember,1930, the period of the Tixploration Licano« granted to the Syndicate. It should be anderstoed, however, that this extension would not affeot the periods specified in the agrssnent of the tnd of Decesjber.lSSS, as those for *hioh a Prospeoting Licence and Mining Lease could be granted, and that the further extension proposed would, if granted, involve the payment to the Sheikh of a sum He.10,000 in respeet of the year ending on the Snd of Deoember 1930. (4) As regards the suggested amendment of the last sentence of paragraph A ef Colonial Office letter of the 16th of Saptenber laet, X am to point out that failure on the part of the Conpany to,observe certain of the conditions set out in the first paragraph of that letter oould not be ramadted even aftarths lapse ef a reasonable time. It should, howerar.- however, toe understood that the Company would h® allowed a reaeonable time in which to appoint a flritiah mmher of the Board of Diraotora, or a Chief Local Hepreeentative in Bahrein, in the event of either of those poata falling vacant* and if the Sattem Oulf Oil Company bo desire, Hia Majesty 's GoTemnent are prepared to agree to the 4th paragraph of the Colonial Office letter of ttfe l«th of Septeraher last heing aman'ied toy the addition thereto of the following words 'it toeing understood that a reasonatole time ohall toe allowed to elapse for the replaoecaent of the British Direotor or the Chief Local Representative in the event of either fcf those poets falling vacant'. His Uajesty's Gove ma ant are, however, anatole to agree to the suggestion that, in the event of a toreach of the conditions presoritoed, the Concession should not toe cancelled tout should revert to the Kastern and General SyAdioate. His Majesty 1 a Government are not prepared to contaaplate a partial or limited assignment of the Concession. Any asaignment now made must toe final and complete and in such fore aa to cause the asaigneea to toe definitely autoatituted for your Syndicate as regarda the enjoyment of all toenefita and the performance of all otoligationa under the Concession. His Majesty's Government are not concerned with the financial arrangements conter.plated toetween your Syndicate and the Sastem Gulf Oil Company in connection with the proposed assignnaent, and the question of aafeguarding the continuing royalty mentioned in the Company's letter under reference, or of providing financial coapsnsation in lieu thereof, ia one for settlsfaent toetween your Syndicate and the Bastem Gulf Oil Company. (S) A# regarda the suggested extension of the concession to cover the whole of Bahrein, ills Majesty's Government consider that this ia a aeparate question which could more properly toe diaouaaed when the questions relating to the existing ^o vernm - ^ * ^«r Gevsnunant have not yot reaohad a deoiaion on the subj eot of the proposed extension of the oonceeaion, and would not ho prepared to take auoh a deoision until they hare had an opportunity of further ooneultation with the local authorities. In the oireumetanoee, they feel aure that the Company would prefer that the two queationa should he dealt with aeparately, and that a settlement of the queations at laaue regarding the exiating eoneeaaion should not he dela ed until a deoision oould he taken an the subject of the extension of that oonceoaion. 2. It mat he understood that Hia iiajesty'a Ooveimmt are not prepared to aaeept any aodifieations» other than those indicated in the foregoing paragraphs, of the conditions proposed in Colonial Office letter of the 16th of Septemher,192l and in the Sastem Gulf Oil Company'a letter of the 24t3li of October,1826. Hie Majeaty'a Oovaarnaent would aocordingly be glad to be infonaed in due courae whether the Baatem Gulf Oil Company are prepared to acoept these conditions with the raodificationa indicated above. If the Company are prepared to agree to those raodificationa Hia Mafaaty'a Qoremraent would be glad to be fumiahed with a draft of the proposed formal aaaignment of the rights of the Saatern and General Syndicate to the proposed new Company. I am, eto.is) g January 30 1903^29. a sir, I am directed by Lord Faesfield to inform you tiiat fie lias had under consideratiou, iu consultation with tne other interested Jepartments of his Majesty's uoveniment, the letter addressed to the Eastern and oeneral syndicate by the ^resident of the Eastern Uulf oil Company, wnich was enclosed in your letter of the 6th of hovernber last, and which is returned to you herewith, ids Majesty's Government note that the Eastern Gulf Oil Company are prepared to accept save in so far as the specific points referred to in their letter of the 24th of October are concerned, the conditions set out in Colonial Office letter of tue 16th of September last. 2. As regards the specific points referred to in the Eastern Uilf Oil Company 1 s letter of the 24th of October, 1 am to make the IcREXARY following i EAGfKHh AhD GI .m EHAL bli-. JlCAXK .LlivJXED.m following observatione (1) &gt; saving regard to the coasirterations referred to in tne seventh paragraph of the Eastern Gulf Oil Company's letter of the 24th of October, his majesty's Government are prepared to recognise the right of the Company to have a voice in the designation and election of the Britisn member of the Board of directors, and to agree that condition (b), referred to in paragraph 1 of Colonial Office letter of the l,th of September last enould be amended to read as follows:- •(b) that of the five Directors of the Company one Director shall at all times be a British subject who siiall be persona grata to His Majesty 's Government, iiis selection for appointment as Director shall be made in consultation with his Majesty 's Government, and his salary as Director snail be provided by the Company *. (2) iiis Majesty's Government do not regard the proposed addition to condition (c) as entirely satisfactory, ihey would, however, be prepared to agree to the addition suggested by the EasternGulf Oil Company subject to Uie addition of the following fur titer proviso - •provided also that any sooner determination of the appointment of Major iiolmes sliall be subject to the consent of uis Majesty's uovernraent, which snail not be unreasonably withheld'. (3) If the Eastern Gulf Oil Company are prepared to agree to the two amendments suggested above, his Majesty's Government will be prepared to advise the aheikh of Bahrein to extend to the 2nd of December,1930, the period of the Exploratioj Licence granted to the Syndicate, It should be understood, however, that this extension would not affect the periods specified in the agreement of the 2nd of Jeceraber, 1925, as ttioee for wnich a prospecting Licence and Mining Lease could be granted, and tJ &lt;at the further extension proposed would, if granted, involve the payment to the Gheikh of a sum its. 10,000 in respect of the year ending on the 2nd of December,1930. (4) As regards the suggested amendment of the last sentence of paragraph 4 of Colonial Office letter of the 16th of September last, 1 am to pointj/ • -s point out tiaat failure on the part of the Compaxiy to observe certain of the conditions set out in the first paragraph of tliat letter could not be remedied even after the lapse of a reasonabXe time. It should, however, be underbto-/d that the Company would be allowed a reasonable time in which to appoint a British xoember of the Hoard of Directors, or a Chief Local Hepresentative in - ahrein, in tne event of eltner of those posts falling vacant, and if the astern Gulf Oil Company so desire, iiis Majesty's uovenment are prepared to agree to tne 4th paragraph of the Colonial Office letter of the 16th of September last being amended by the addition thereto of the following words 'it being understood that a reasonable time shall be allowed for the replacement of the British Director or the Chief Local Kepresentative in the event of either of those posts falling vacant*. *ds majesty's Government are, however, unable to agree to the suggestion tnat, in the '■vent of a breach of the conditions prescribed, s, tne Concession should not be cancelled but snould revert to the Eastern and ueneral syndicate, ids feajesty's Government are not prepared to contemplate \3^ contemplate a partial or limited assignmetit of the ConceBSion. Any aselgumeat now made must be final and coroplete and in bucu form ae to cause tne assignees to be definitely substituted for i?our syndicate as regards tne enjoyment of all bene fits and ttie performance of all obligations under the Conceseion, ids luajesty's uovernment are not concerned with the financial arrangements contemplated between your Syndicate and the Eastern Gulf Oil Company in connection with the proposed assignment, and the question of safeguarding the continuing royalty mentioned in the Company's letter under reference, or of providing financial compensation in lieu thereof, is one for settlement between your syndicate and the Eastern uulf Oil Company. (5) As regards the suggested extension of the concession to cover tne wijole of Bahrein, nis Majesty's Government consider that tnis is a separate question which could more properly be discussed when the questions relating to tne existing concession have been disposed of. ^o decision has yet been reached by ids Majesty's Government in regard to the application made by your?3) your i»yxidicat.e for such an extension, ab probable toat further consultation with the local authorities will be necessary before a decision ic reached on the subject, and, while his l.ajesty' b Goverttflent cannot indicate the line which their decision is likely to take, it would be unwise to assume that it will necessarily be favourable. In these circumstances, further delay must be anticipated, and ilia .vajeuty's government feel that the Company will agree with them that, from their point of view also, it is preferable that the two m- tters should be dealt with separately, and tirnt a .attlement of the questions at issue regarding the existing concession should not be delayed until a decision can be taken on toe subject of its extension. 3. It must be understood that i4 .s Majesty's Goverrsaent are not prepared to accept any modifications, other than those indicated in the foregoing paragraphs, of the conditions proposed in Colonial Office letter of the 16th of September,1929, and in the Eastern v .If Oil Company's letter of the 24th of October,1929. His Majesty's Oovernraent would accordingly be glad to bebe informed in due course wnetner the masteru uulf Oil Company are prepared to accept, these conditions with the modifications Indicated above. If the Company are prepared to agree to those modifications his Majesty's Government would be glad to be furnished with a draft of the proposed fonasl assignment of the rights of the Eastern and General aymticate to the proposed new Company. 1 am, blr, Your obedient servant. om- 'IAL . Downing Street, January, 1930. Sir, I have the honour to refer to your telegram No.4 of the 3rd of January, regarding the further payment of Rs.10,000/- made to the Bahrein Government by the Eastern and General Syndicate Limited, and to transmit herewith, for your infomation, copies of two ^sJ^letters on the subject received from the Syndicate. You will have learned from ray Confidential desoatch of the 8th of January of the stage reached in the negotia^ tions with the Syndicate on the subject of. the assign ment of their rights in Bahrein to American interests. Until those negotiations are completed it will not be possible to say what payments will be due from the Syndicate to the Shaikh of Bahrein, but I assume that the payment of Rs.10,000/- referred to above has been made by the Syndicate in anticipation of the satisfac tory conclusion of the negotiations and the extension, until the 2nd of December, 1920, of the Licence to explore for oil in Bahrein. 2.

I am directed to inform you that on the 27th ultimo this Syndicate cabled instructions to the Eastern Bank at Bahrein to pay to the Consolidated Fund of the Bahrein State Government the sum of 10,000 Rupees, being the yearly rental of the Bahrein Oil Concession, ■which was due on the 2nd instant. The Eastern Bank replied on the 2nd instant stating that the Bahrein Grovernment had refused to accept this payment until they had received fuller information from us. The refusal of the Bahrein Government to accept the 10,000 Rupees is doubtless due to their knowledge of the questions which are at present in course of settlement between us and they will naturally expect advices from you before they will officially accept the renewal rental. I am therefore to say that my Directors assume, in view of the present state of the negotiations with you, that the delay by the Bahrein Government in accepting the rental will not in any way prejudice this Syndicate.

I am, etc, (sd.) 0. G. E. Williams. The Under Secretary of State, India Office.9035/30. Downing Street 8th l , e'bruary,1930. Sir, I am directed by Lord Passfield to inform you that he has had under consideration your letter of the 30th of January (HA/^P) enclosing a copy of a letter addressed to your Syndicate hy Major H.G.Davis, representing the Eastern Gulf Oil Company. I am to inform you that the interpretation placed 'by the Eastern Gulf Oil Company upon paragraph 3 of Colonial Office letter of the 3rd of January, No. 69035/29, as recorded in paragraphs 2 and 3 Of Major Davis's letter, is correct. It is the intention of His Majesty's Government, provided that full agreement is reached upon the subjects dealt with in the present correspondence, to advise the Shaikh of Bahrein to extend to the 2nd of December,1930, the period of the Exploration Licence granted to the Syndicate, and it was their intention that at the expiration of this Licence, the Prospecting Licence should run for two years, this period being open to extension for a further two years subject to the stipulations of Article IV of the Agreement between the Shaikh of Bahrein and your Syndicate. The Mining Lease would then follow upon the Prospecting Licence in accordance with Article V, of the aforesaid Agreement. 2. His Majesty's Government agree that the payment to the Shaikh of a sum of Rs.10,000 in respect of the year ending on the 2nd of December 1930, to which reference was made in paragraph 2 (3) of the letter from crstary, E TR&amp;STERU AND GBHSRAL SYNDICATE,LIMITED. thisthis Department of the 3rd of January, has, in fact, been made 'by your Syndicate, and they do not propose to advise the Shailch that any further payment should 'be made on this account. 3. As regards the question raised in paragraph 4 of Major Davis's letter, I am to explain that His Majesty's Government fully appreciate that the registered office of the Company formed to operate the Bahrein concession must 'be situated in Canada, and they have no wish to suggest any alteration of this arrangement. The object of condition (a) in paragraph 1 of Colonial Office letter of the 16th of September last was to secure that the company should, in addition, open and maintain an office in this country which should at all times be in the charge of a British subject, who should be the recognised channel of communication between the Company and His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. 4. If the foregoing explanations are satisfactory to your Syndicate and to the Eastern Gulf Oil,Company, I am to suggest that you should forthwith cause to be prepared a draft of the formal document to govern the assignment of the Syndicate's rights under the Bahrein Agreement, and should communicate a copy of the draft to the Colonial Office at an early date for their consideration. I am, et c. (Sd.) 0.G.R.Williams.Note of an Interview at the Colonial Office with Representatives of the Eastern and General Syndicate Limited. Mr. Janson, Major Holmes, and the Syndicate Solicitor, Mr. Pott (of Messrs. Holmes, Son and Pott) called at the Colonial Office by appointment on the 6th of February, and were seen by Mr. Williams, Mr. Bushe, and Mr. Hall. The points raised in Major Bavis^ letter to the Syndicate, a copy of which accompanied the Syndicate's letter of the 30th of January, were discussed. It was agreed that the interpretation placed by Major Davis, in paragraphs 2 and 3 of his letter, upon paragraph 3 of the Colonial Office letter of the 3rd of January represented flae intentions of His Majesty's Government, and that the explanations asked for by Major Davis on behalf of the Eastern Gulf Oil Company could be given without involving any alteration of the position taken up by His Majesty's Government. Paragraph 4 of Major Davis's letter was then discussed. Mr. Janson explained that the doubts which were present in the mind of the Eastern Gulf Oil Company were to be explained by ignorance of the requirements of the English Companies Act, which required the registration of any agency set up in this country. The Company apparently feared that if their agency in London were 'registered', this would involve the payment of income tax in the United Kingdom. They also seemed to fear that the intention underlying our condition was to secure that the main office of the Company should be situated in London, and that their principal business should be transacted there. He had assured the American interests that His Majesty's GovernmentGovernment had no such intention, and that their only wish was that the Company should maintain an office or agency in this country under a British suhject, through whom all communioations 'between His Majesty's Government and the Company should be addressed. Mr.Janson was informed that he had rightly interpreted the wishes of His Majesty's Government, and it was agreed to assure the Eastern Gulf Oil Company that His Majesty's Government realised that the registered office of the Canadian Company must be situated in Canada, and that all they wanted was that the Canadian Company should open an office in this country, which should be in the charge of a British subject, who should be the recognised channel cf communication between the Company and His Majesty's Government. The precise nature of the formal instrument governing the assignment of the Syndicate's rights under the Bahrein Agreement was then discussed# It was agreed that this should take the form of a tripartite deed, to be signed by or on behalf of the Shaikh of Bahrein, the Eastern and General Syndicate, and the Eastern Gulf Oil Company, and that in this document the Shaikh should confirm the assignment, subject to the conditions set out in Colonial Office letters of the 16th of September and the 3rd of January, and the Company should covenant to carry out those conditions, which conditions should be made expressly subject to the penalty provisions of Article VII of the Agreement of the 2nd of December,1925, and Article XI of the Mining Lease scheduled thereto# It was agreed that a reply should be sent by the Colonial Office to the Syndicate's letter of the 30th of January, conveying the assurance asked for in Major Davis'sDavis's letter, and that in the meantime Mr. Pott would prepare a draft of the proposed Deed would agree it with Messrs. Freshfields (who are representing the interests of the Eastern Gulf Oil Company) and would them communicate the draft to the Colonial Office for their approval.7 /? File 222 British Consulate-General, San Francisco, February 19th 193CU Sir and Dear Colleague:- I have to-day given a letter of introduction to you,copy of which is enclosed,to Mr^W # F.Taylor, General Superintendent of the Producing Division of the Standard Oil Company of California,who is _19t]^^ leaving here in the near future for Bahrein Island ). where, I understand,his Company has a concession to prospect for oil.

In hiw view a nuch ©iiapler arid better procedure mould be to leave the Colonial Office conditions in the correspondence. iucrc was. ne argued, no real need to recite those conditio as in any formal document, or in aay ease in any document which the waaikh need sign, ihe Kastern Gulf Oil Company could not, in any ease, work; the concession with any hope of success without the full \ support of ids teajesty's Governrcent. ihey could not expect to have taat full support unlees they scrupulously adhered to the coudltlons imposed by tae Colonial Office. Consequently, any breach of tnoss conditions would be directly etgainst their own interests, and would provide Its own penalty* mere was no need, therefore,to give the ahaUtb a Concession in the event of a breach of the formal right to cancel th«/conditions. Mt iioped that his k&amp;Jessty's uoveracent would see their way to drop the proposal for a tripartite ues4, and would be content to let the matter rest on the basis of the correspondence which had already been exchanged.

Dear Mr. Ballantine, I write with reference to our conversation on ,1811 the Slat February. a « As regards the general legal position in Bahrein, I referred you to the Bahrein Orders in Council of 1913 and 1932. as regards the assignraent of the rights of the Bastern and General syndicate, you will remember that I explained that I was to sane extent at a disadvantage, as I had not been aware of the point which you proposed to raise, and so had not had an opportunity of considering it, but that, if you were of opinion that there was in fact any »• necessity to comply with any specific requirements of ^h® ^ocal law of Bahrein, I thought you would be well advised to apply for information regarding its requirements direct to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire. 3. I have now been able to look again at the papers, but I fear that I cannot help you. I myself think it most unlikely that there is any specific local law applicable to the assignment which should be complied with, but I am unable to give you any assistance on the subject, and if you feel any doubt in the matter, I can only suggest that you should consult the Political Resident.

Dear Sir, We are very much obliged to you for your letter of even date relative to the local laws of Bahrein. We note what you say. We are still without instructions on the matter tout we are doing what we can to advance matters in the expectation of receiving instructions to go forward. Among other things, we have obtained and perused with much interest, the two Bahrein orders in Council of 1913 and 1922. We see that in the Order of 1913, Clause 8 of Part I en page 4 reference is made to His Majesty having jurisdiction over foreigners with respect to whom the sheikh of Bahrein has agreed with His Majesty for, or consented to, the exercise of jurisdiction by His Majesty. Could we trouble you further to the extent of enquiring if His Majesty has, in fact, arranged to exercise any such jurisdiction? May we take this opportunity of thanking you for the courtesy you extended to our Mr. Ballantyne the other day? Yours faithfully, (Signed) OTCBSKFISLDfi,LBBSE AHD MUHNS.

Major Holmes has not yet arrived at Bushire 'but when he does the Hon/hle the political 'Resident proposes to inform him that $ copy of the letter from Messrs Freshfields, Leese and Munns has been transmitted to you that you will send a reply direct to them 'by cable. Should there be any point on which you are in doubt you should refer i't to the Political Resident for orders. 1 am to express a hope that on Major Holmes # s arrival it will be possible to obtain Shaikh Hamad's assent to the draft agreement without much delay. You will observe that in the draft received from the Secretary of State provision has been made fof the Shaikh's signature to be witnessed by the Hon'ble the Political Resident. inquiry has however been made from London as to whether it would not suffice if the signature was witnessed by you, in order to obviate delavp delay, you will be informed of the- reply in due course. 1 have the honour to he, Sir, Your obedient servant, Captain, for yeci'etary to the Political hesident in the Persian Gulf.Enclosure 31, OLD JSWEf, E.G.2. 14th March, 1930 Sir, negotiations have now, we think, been concluded for the transfer to the Bahrein Petroleum Conpajy Limited (a Canadian Company) of the Concession Agreement dated the 2nd December, 1925 entered into between His Excellency The Sheikh of Bahrein and tne Eastern and General Syndicate, Limited as modified by stipulations or conditions which have been agreed with Hie Majesty's Government and so that the same will become binding upon the Bahrein Petroleum Company, Limited. We are interested as Solicitors advising the American Interests. We understand you are cognisant of all the facts relating to the case and you, no doubt, have a copy of the draft of the 'Assent' which it is proposed should be entered into between His Excellency and the Eastern and General Syndicate, Limited. You will have observed that this document is contingent, for its effect, upon the vesting in the Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited, of the said Concession Agreement. Such vesting will be effected by another document which in the view of the Eastern and General Syndicate, Limited and the Bahrein Petroleum Company, Limited is sufficient for the purpose. This document will not be produced to His Excellency but notice of it will be given by the Eastern and General Syndicate Limited to His Excellency as is provided by the 'Assent'. We are concerned to see what (if any) laws applicable11 applicable ia Bahrain, affect the position. You will appreciate, of course, that we have to advise the Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited that the eastern and General Syndicate, Limited are definitely the legal owners of the said Concession Agreement and the rights thereunder according to the local law, as against all parties, and that when the transfer of the Agreement to the Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited is complete that Company will stand in the same position as the Eastern and General Syndicate Limited now stand. There may be requirements of the local laws necessitating some act or fomality, e.g. registration of a deed or other document or alteration of a Register by attendance of th® parties by proxy to complete the title of the Bail rein Petroleum Company Limited. We understand there is in Bahrein, a Register of Ownership of land but What the purpose of it is, we do not know. Would you be good enough to explain this to us, and at the same time tell us to what particular interests it relates? Would you also please advise us whether the estate or interest created by the leasing of territory under the Concession Agreement of the 2nd December 1925 creates such an estate or interest in land as would be governed by the local laws? If so, what steps would have to be taken to comply with such laws, and when? We use the term 'local laws' without having any very clear idea of what this phrase means. So far as the Register we have referred to is concerned, we believe that this has been established by Custom. Theieare, of course, the Bahrein Orders in Council of 19131913 and 1922, and there are, no doubt, Regulations made by you but as to the practical local effect of these, we have no knowledge. There are also, no doubt Orders issued by His Excellency or other the State Government of Bahrein. There is one further question we would like to put to you, and that is. By whom and in what form (if any) a Receipt for moneys payable under or in respect of the Concession Agreement of the 2nd December 1925 should be given so as to constitute a complete discharge to the Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited, or the Eastern and General Syndicate Limited, as the case may be, as against His Excellency and all other parties (if any) interested. As you know, there are certain periodical payments due under the Agreement and if the provisions concerning a Mining Lease become operative, then royalxties will also probably become payable and we would like to be able to advise our Clients now and for all time what they should accept as a formal and final discharge for such payments made by them. We enclose a form of Receipt which we suggest might serve as a precedent. Do you think it will be sufficient? Major Frank Holmes is kindly bringing this letter to you; we have discussed it with Mm, and he will no doubt be able to afford to you any further explanations which you may require. If so, please cable fully to us. It would be agreat convenience to us, and we think to others concerned, if we could have your short reply by cable, followed by a confirmatory letter in detail. If you could expedite the letter by Air Mail, we would appreciateappreciate this. Will you kindly permit Major Holmes to reimburse you all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this matter? fe are, Sir, Yours faithfully, (Sgd) FRESHFISLDS LSES1 AND MUHNS. The Hon.

Political igecny, Bahrain. The 26th April 1930. Prom To Captain 0. 0. Prior, I.i., Political Agent, Bahrain. The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to refer to the Bahrain Oil Concession of 1925 and to draw your attention to Article VI in the Third Schedule of Mining Lease. This lease will, at the option of the Eastern and General Syndicate or their successors inevitatlyfollow the present prospecting lease, and it is the far reaching provisions of this clause that I wish to bring to your notice. 2. lou will observe that the wording of the second paragraph says that ' If in spite of the efforts of the s; id guards thefts should occur, the Shaikh undertakes to re* -cover the property stolen and to compensate the company for any damage sustained in his territory.' In the event of non-recovery of the stolen property the value thereof shall be deducted by the company from any sums due to the Shaikh by the company.' 3. I pointed this out to Mr. Belgrave, and he agreed with me that the State incurred a very serious lia- -bility by this section. Further, I pointed out that apart from the question of compensation for theft, the words ♦ and to compensate the company for any damage sustained in his territory ' unless read as referring to the stolen property, would involve the State in possible liabilities that might run into thousands of pounds.4. I suggested two hypothetical cases. One, a company's employee might steal 10,000 rupees from a safe belonging to thea^nd by the wording of this clause the State would clearly hsve to compensate th«- company. Mr. Belgrave agreed with me. Then again there is another possibility. Suppose that wilful damage or sabotage occurs^/is caused to the machinery or plant, by the guards, the employees or dis- -gruntled inhabitants of Bahrain, either inyj^ or in transit from the Customs or anywhere at all inside the terri -torial waters: It could be agjrfted that the State was liable to compensate the company for this loss since it would be ' Any damage sustained in his territory, « and to do so might consume the royalties for the remainder of the leas®. I sent for Major Holmes ana asked his view on the Article as viewed in the light of these hypotheses. He agreed that the Article was very vngue, but said tnat it had been inserted by the fiolonisl Office anc! that he felt sure that the Qompany would never desire to strain its meaning to tnat extent. He woulu not however bina himself as to what they would interpret it to mean, as he saiu it was a setter for lawyers to tteciae, not aaWfflly «nou«jij, ,yula he sxpress hias«lf in writing or in any way commit the Company, though he holds full power of attorney from them. I gathered that his personal view of the meaning was that the Shaikh was responsible for keeping the guard upto their duties and pre- -venting petty thefts, but not for cash etc, in the charge of the Company's servants. He was however of the opinion that the guard would be responsible for preventing damage or sabotage even by the Company's servants, and that the State would have to indemnify them. 6. I told him that it was essential, in my opinion, that the question should be cleared up before we proceeded any further, so that the State might know exactly what they had to contend with. I suggested that a letter should be given either by Ms Syndicate or by the proposec Company indicat- -ina- the extent to which they considered the Satet liable.3. He appeared to resent this and said that it was * Going back ' on the concession, to which I replied that to ask for an explanation of a section could not be held to be going back on an agreement. He then said that once the assignment of the Soncession was signed, if the State approached the concessionaires, he was sure that they would agree to a reasonable interpretation. I said that the State would then be in their hands, and Major Holmes, interrupting said that was exactly where they were now. I disagreed with this, and said that I should suggest to you that the Shaikh be adyised not to sign the Assignment until the point had been elucidated. 7. Major Holmes now became much alarmed and said that we should be putting the ides into the Shaikh's kmx head that he could alter the agreement at will, and creating a very dangerous precedent. I him that I saw no reason why he should be informed, and that in any case he could have ac uired that idea when I mentioned t the Assignment to him but that he had not done so. He reiterated his point that the concession could not be tampered with, but I said that the assignment amounted to a favour from the Shaikh and had been put through to suit the concessionaires and that it was unreasonable ± e in the circumstances to refuse a statement of how the State stood as regards liabilities that could at present ^^scaroeIy|assessed . 8. I then told Major Holmes that I would put forward the suggestion to you that the Shaikh should not be asked to sign the new Assignment until this matter ha been cleared up^ and undertook to inform him in writing that I was going to ao so, that he might advise his firm. I gather his principal cause for alarm is that a ship- -load of nearly a thousand tons of materisls has already left the States, and he fears that this eleventh hour hi may cause great delay OTmagJ to the necessary consulta-4 tions with their ..onerioau associates. 1 feel very earn- -estly that the State has heen so kept in the dark throughout the whole negotiations that we, who are definitely responsible for advising them, should leave no stone unturned to have this matter cleared up. 9. Should you decide that it is too late to take action at this stage, another opportunity will occur to bring pressure to hear on the Bahrain Petroleum Company though they would no doubt require a quid pro quo. In 1928 a draft supplementary agreement for an exploring, prospecting and mining concession for the raraaining areas of the islands was forwarded to the Secretary at Bushire with this office letter 0-199 dated the 5th July. This agreement eventually fell through because Captain Parke ( who was acting as Adviser) greatly increased the amounts payable in royalty. I understand from Major Holmes that he will recommence negotiations for this directljc the present Assignment is disposed of. Since they are anxious to acquire this extra territory, ( not, Major Holmes tells me on account of the supposed oil it covers, but because it will give j. |fe. them greater freedom in siting their pipelines,) ad- -vantage might be taken of this to get the Concession- -aires to accept a revised rendering of the clause to which I have taken objection, and to have it so worded Ibhat the liability of the State is reduced to reasonably proportions. A suita le wording would appear to be one which confined the Shaikh's responsibility to thefts directly attributable to the guards negligence ( but excluded offences by the Company's servants and/or damage for which the guards could be held personally liable. It must be remembered that the guards will be a wildwild and undisciplined body of men, probably similar to our night watciuaen, and that it is not reasonable to expect from them an efficiency and ability which have not 1 yet been instilled into the MA NAMA Police Force. 10. There is one further point which I should # » ^ like to mention. Last summer the uestion of keeping certain areas free from rigs etc belonging to the Oil Company were considered, so as not to interfere with aviation. Has any conclusion been arrived at regarding thisf Major Holmes believes that an undertaking has been given by them, and if so I would be flad of a copy to complete my file. I had understood that it was to be embodied in the new Assignment, but this has not been done. 11. I explained to Shaikh Hamad and Shaikh A f Abdullah the purport of the Assignment and although Shaikh Abdullah showed alarm at hearing that the Company was not entirely British, upon learning that His Majesty's Government had approved the transfer. His Excellency said he was prepared to sign it after it had been translated. This has now been done, but in view of i ' points I have raised in this despatch I would be flad to know whether I should not await further instructions fro you. The witnessing of the origingl concession was, I find, carried out by Major Daly and not the Political Resident of the day, so there would, prima facie, appear no reaso why the Political Agent's signature should not suffice on a deed transferring it to a third party. I have the honour to be. Sir, lour most obedient saTpan Political Agent, Bahrain.Eastern and general Syndicate Limited^ J \ ahrein agents; M. YATEEM BROS. ]6l vble address: sensynd, Bahrein,' 26 th, April. 1930. de—broomhalls. To. His B. ! s Political Agent bahrein. Dear Sir, . ^ ^ am in rec Gipt of your confidential letter ^■0.57-0 of 1930 and dated the 26th April 1930. I note that you are suggesting to The Hon'lDle The Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf that the Eastern &amp; General Syndicate, Ltd, should be asked to explain what they understand by Article YI of The Mining Lease of 1925, and that the signature of the transfer should be suspended until this has been done. I must again strongly protest against this very arbitrary action, my principals will look upon this suggestion as nothing less than an attempt to-tamper with the Concession Agreement which I know they will strongly oppose, more especi ally when you also suggest that the signature of the transfer should be suspended, pending a clarification of a 0lipase which does not in any manner apply to the transfer. Furthermore delaying the signature to the transfer also involves delaying the signature to the extension of the Exploration License, this is a serious matter to the Company as five (5) months have already expired of the year for which the extension was asked. Without entering into the merits or demerits of Clause YI, I feel that if representations,apart from the question of transfer of any other extraneous points^had been yfnJ 2 - P.T.O.made to my Company as to the scope and bearing of Clause VI, the Company would not have been averse to giving an assurance that the Company's rights would not be exercised in an arbi trary or unfair manner. I respectfully request you to forward a copy of this letter to The Hon'ble The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf together v/ith a copy of the cable I despatched today to my Company in reference to this-question of Clause VI. Two copies of each are enclosed herewith. Yours faithfully. For and on I of £he Eastern &amp; General LTranslation of Telegram dated 25th April and despatched on 26th April 1930. and addressed to EASG-EIISYITD .. LOHDOl. At his request I had interview** with the Political Agent Bahrein this morning at which the Financial Adviser to the Government of Bahrein was present greater part of the time stop. The Political Agent of Bahrein brought up the question of Clause number VI of Mining Lease of the Bahrein Oil Concession Agreement dated December 2nd Year 1925, and stated that until the full purport of this Clause has been defined and what interpretation the Eastern &amp; General Syndicate,Ltd, places thereon, he did not feel that he could recommend the Sheiiih of Bahrein to sign the Perm of Assent Indenture without first referring to She Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf stop. This course of action by the Political Agent of Bahrein, was I gathered decided upon in consultation with the Financial Adviser to the Bahrein Government stop. The Political Agent of Bahrein and the Financial Adviser to the Bahrein Government stated that they consider that most arbitrary and far reaching financial demands could be made under Clause VI on the Sheikh of Bahrein for losses incurred by the Company resulting from action over which the Sheikh of Bahrein had no control stop. They suggested for example, if employee of Company stole money from Company, if not recovered the Sheikh of Bahrein could be called upon to make amount good stop. I was asked by the Political Agent of Bahrein to express my views on the scope of Clause number VI, I conveyed that I did not think that the Company would interpret it in such an arbitrary manner as they suggested it would be possible to do stop. I also stated that it was entirely outside my powers to alter, define or modify any part of The Bahrein Oil Concession Agreement - 2 - P.T.O.that 'being solely a question of mj Company and their lawyers stop. I also pointed out the grave danger of inciting the Sheikh of Bahrein to demand any alteration in fhe Bahrein Oil Concession Agreement stop. The Political Agent of Bahrein suggested that as the Company were asking a favour of the Sheikh of Bahrein in requesting an extension of the Exploration License that the Coia^any shoikld mdify Clause number VI or at least define 'by letter the Company^ views as to the Company 1 s rights and limits of the Company's demands under Clause TI, before Form of Assent be signed stop. I pointed out that the Company were not asking a favour in requesting an extension of the Exploration License, but exer cising a right granted in the Bahrein Oil Concession Agreement itself stop. The position when my interview terminated was that the Political Agent of Bahrein would submit the question of Clause VI, to The HonSble Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to decide whether the question of its interpretation be raised at this juncture or not stop. The Political Agent of Bahrein informed me that the question of Clause number VI had not been raised by the Sheikh of Bahrein nor had he been up to the present told or consulted in the matter stop.

My Lord, 1 have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordatiip'e despatch Confidential, Uated the 2tfth March 1930, transnitting to rae a letter froia Messrs Treohfields, Leese and Uunna. the original of this letter was presented to me yesterday by aajor Holmes, who left for Bahrain in the evening. 8. In their letter stiesnrs yreslifields, i^eese and Munns desire to be infomed whether the reuuircnents of tlie local laws necessitate compliance with any form alities, what the purpose of the register of ownership of land is and whether the estate or interest created by the leasing of territory under the Concession Agree ment of 2nd December 1928 creates such an interest or estate in land governed by the local laws. finally, they enquire by whom and in what form the receipt for money payable under the concession sho.ld be given so as to corajjete a discharge. The rsolicitors have asked rae to cable my reply. I informed Major Holmes verbally, however, Passfleld, p.o., Majesty's Secretary of State the Colonies, nial Office, om.pliklcu -2- however. that I regretted, that I was not in a posit so answer these questions * tliat the Balirain State was juridically an independent Government and the Slmikh an independent Huler though he did not exercise jurisdiction over foreigners, and I therefore suggested to him that he should approadi sir Belgrave, Adviser to the Bahrain Ooverranent, on arrival at Bahrain, who would be in a position to give hira full information regarding any fonaalities connected witii the x'egittration of land which raight be required by the Bahrain law and also supply him with details regarding the register of land which was being prepared. Major Holmes expressed the view to m that the oil concession did not confer any ownership in the land ana m this view I inclined to agree. If so, no registration would presumably be necessary except for such land as the Company wish to occupy for buildings, etc. I do not, however, know how far the procedure for the registration of land has proceeded or what rules have been frawed regarding it. This information will be obtainable, however, from the local authorities at Bafarain and asked aajor Holraes to reply to Messrs freshficias. Lease and Munns or to get the Political Agent to do so. As regards the question of the receipt; the foria suggested by aessrs Freshfields, lieese and Munna would seem suitable and if this is signed by Shaikh Hanad or by Mr Belgrave on his behalf it would, in my opinion, constitute a complete discharge against any other person. I have thought it desirable to send this rflply through you instead of direct to the Solicitors. I mould request that, if Your Lordship sees no objection, it should be conraunicated to Messrs jfreshfields, .ueese and Uunns. I have the honour to be, with the highest respect, Your Lordship's most obedient, , , „ humble servant, j?/ -7 ' . / - u -'No. 68-C of 1930. Political Agency, Bahrain, The 6th May 1930, To Messrs, Freshfield Leese and Munne, 31 Old Jev/ry , E.G.2 London. Dear Sirs, Please refer to my telegram No. 733 dated 29th April 1930 ishich contained replies to some of your queries. The matter is treated more fully in this letter as requested hy you* 2. There is no local law that vdll affect the transfer, for the concession is sui generis. His Excellency Shaikh Hamad's signature as Ruler, countersigned by that of the Political Agent or the Hon'ble the Political Resident repre- -seating the Protecting Power will suffice for all purposes and render the transfer binding, 3. The Political Agency maintains a register of deeds for British and Protected subjects, and I advise the registration of the transfer in this register, which the official register for such documents. This could be done by your local representative at any time. Apart from the records of the .adhis or religious Judges, which will not affect your clients, the Bahrain Government have no such register at present. 4. The land registers, on the other hand, are maintaine entirely by the Bahrain Government Land Department. Ti leasing of territory however under the concession does not create an estate such as would be cohered by local laws. When the company hire or buy landed property for their purposes some formalities will have to be gone through, but simce a certain amount of reorganisation is going on in the Land?7 tand Department it would serve no useful purpose to give their details at present* lou may rest assured, however, that this Agency will supply such information as may he required to 1 Company's representative should he apply for it. 5. It is somewhat difficult to reply to your query regarding local laws. There is, of course, the Shara'a or lohammadan law which is the only official law 01 ^he State, hut decrees issued hy the Ruler have had the effect of altering and limiting its effect. There are also certain customs with the force of law, hut I do not think it likely that your clients will come into contact with them at present. 6. British and Protected subjects are subject to the Order in Council and rules issued under them, the principal effect heing that certain Indian enactments have been applied including the Penal Code and Criminal Procedure Codes. The procedure in tie Agency Courts is assimilated to British Infllfw Courts and the Political Agent exercises the powers of a Sessions Judge. Cases between Protectee persons and cases in which a protected person is a defrmdant appear in the Agency Courts, hut cases in which a IHilsh subject is a defendant and a protected person J complainant appear before the Joint Court. The Joint Court is not necessarily bound by British Indian enactments. 7. The system is, however simpler than would appea, at first sight, and the company's representatives can obtain all the information they require on application at the Agency In conclusion, I might add that the Political Agent is authorised to perform any act that a British Consul would he empowered to do, and that he is empowered to register births, deaths and marriages. Should you require any further inform- -ation upon any particular point I shall be pleased to give it. Yours faithfully (sd ) C. G.

The Syndicate will however wish to expedite the matter as the extra area facilitates the laying of pipe lines. 3.

Sir, We refer to the conversation which we had with Mr.Lloyd last week when we discussed the modifications which had been suggested in the Mining Lease to he granted by the Sheikh of Bahrein to Eastern and General Syndicate Limited or their Assignees in accordance with the Concession dated the 2nd Deoember, 1925. We cabled to our Clients and informed them that a proposal had been made to restrict the liabilities of the Sheikh under Clause 6 of the Mining Lease to 10,000 Rupees per annum, and that a further suggestion had been made to release him from all liability for thefts by the Company's employees. We have now received cabled instructions from our Clients on this matter. Our Clients ; do not consider that they should be asked to agree \ to any such modifications as the form of the Mining Lease has been agreed for some time, and also as \ \ the Assent, in the form in which it is prcrposed ' ff\ It should be signed, has been approved by the \ Colonial Office. This Clause: (/v£ This Clause which makes the Sheikh personally liable was clearly inserted originally so as to ensure that he would enforce the covenants in the Mining Lease to protect the Company 1 property and recover it if stolen. The fact that theft might be committed by an employee of the Company should not relieve the Sheikh of the liability to use his utmost endeavours to recover the same, and though it is true that the employees will have greater oppirtunities of stealing than outside persons, our Clients consider, and we agree, that it would be dangerous to draw any distinction between employees and other persons. Our Clients are, however, prepared to assure the Sheikh that they will not hold him responsible for thefts by the Company's European employees as the Sheikh will not have the same opportunities of enforcing his authority on such persons. If such assurance is required, it should, we consider, be given in a separate letter and should not be inserted in the formal Assent. should be obliged if you would therefore give the necessary instructions to the Political Agent so that he can obtain the execution by the Sheikh of the Assent In Its present form at the earliest possible date. If you desire a letter of assurance to be given to the Sheikh at the same time, perhaps you will let us know, when we could quickly agree a short form of letter. We are, etc., (Signed) FRESHFISLDS, LSESE &amp; MUNNS.

Sir, We enclose herewith a print of the proposed Assignment of the Concession granted by the Sheikh of Bahrein to the Eastern &amp; General Syndicate Limited in the form in which it is at present proposed that it should be executed. The reason for the deletion of the last two lines of Clause 3 is that the royalties referred to in those lines were payable on the happening of certain events prior to a fixed date; that fixed date is now passed and the events have not happened. You will observe that the second sentence of Clause 5 specifically refers to the consideration payable under the Option Agreement. As you know, vie are endeavouring to ascertain whether the Assignment .vill need to be registered in the Local Land Registry as should this be v*#; necessary we understand you will require the statement of the ooneideration to be omitted from the Deed. Prom a cabled reply to our enquiries, we have received, it would appear that registration is not necessary except at the British Agency. We understand Jhe Under-Secretary of State, Colonial Office, S.W.I.understand that if registration is neoessary the Colonial Office or the India Office will insist on the statement of eonsideration being deleted. Could you please inform us if this is the oase as regards the Colonial Office, and could you please make enquiries from the India Office as to the attitude which they will take up? We are, etc., (Signed) FRESHFIELDa, LEESE &amp; MUNNS. f ; i ■ - : v . ' V' 5/30 Downing Street, 15th May, 1930. Gentlemen, I am direoted by Lord Passfleld to /), ^ &lt; ^ rN± acknowledge the receipt of your letter ON/SJB of the 7th of May regarding the liability imposed upon the Sheikh of Bahrein by Article VI in the Mining Lease scheduled to the Bahrein oil concession car the 2nd of December, 1925. 2. It is noted that your clients are not disposed to agree to the limitation of that liability to a sum not exceeding Rb .10,000 in any one year, or to the further suggestion that the Sheikh should i ' a be released from all liability for thefts oommitted, by ©mployees of the concessionary company. 3. The Secretary of Stats cannot but regret that your clients should have rejected these suggestions, but, having regard to the basis on which the negotiations for the assignment of the concession have been conducted, he will not press further the view that the modifications proposed should be adopted. 4. Lord Passfield considers that an assurance should be given to the Sheikh of Bahrein on the lines suggested in the third paragraph of your letter, but he is advised that the exemption from responsibility ®SSR3. FRESHFIELDS, LEESE &amp; MUNNS./jTb responsibility which it is proposed to aooord to the Sheikh should extend to thefts by any employees of the companies concerned 'who are not of local (i .e. Bahrein) origin', since any persons who fall within thfcs definition will not be under the direct authority or control of the Sheikh. An assurance in these terms can best be given in the form of a letter, which Major Holmes might be authorised to sign on behalf of the two companies concerned, and to deliver to the Sheikh at the time of signature of the agreement setting out the conditions which govern the assignment of the concession. It is suggested that the letter might be in the following termsj* of the Sheikh of Bahrein to the assignment of the Bahrein oil concession, to the Bahrein Petroleum Company, Limited, the said Company agrees that the provisions in the second paragraph of Article VI of the Mining Lease, (which forms the Third Schedule to the concession) shall only apply in respect of thefts or damage committed by persons who are of Bahrein origin.* On the receipt of information that this form of assurance is acceptable to your clients and that Major Holmes has been authorised to sign a letter in the terns set out above, the necessary instructions will be sent to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 5, As regards your letter CN/EJB of the 9th of May, I am to inform you that you are mistaken in 'In further consideration of the assent \ supposing* supposing that either the Colwiiai Office, or, so far as is known, any other department of His Majesty's Qovernoent, would wish to insist on the omission from the assignment enolosed in that letter of all mention of the consideration to be paid by the Bahrein Petroleum Company, Limited, to the Eastern and General Syndicate, Limited.

I*®' Hlf BANK BUiLDINUS, 31, OLD JUHJf, (4.0.2.) 17th lay, 19o0. mr. ^ ■H9thank you for your letter dated the 15th instant, and we observe that the Secretary of otate is of the opinion that the sheikh should be relieved of liability, for thefts committed by any of the Company's wnployees who are not of Bahreini origin. Fran our conversation on the telephone yesterday, we understan that the objection you see to making the Shtikh personally liable for the acts of persons other then Bahrein natives is that such persons are subject to British jurisdiction and that therefore the Sheikh would not be able to enforce his absolute authority over then, or, if they left the country, over their possessions so as to compensate himself for sums deducted by the Company from the suns payable to him. ■Ve may say that we understood and we advised our Clients that the question of amending the Mining Lease was originally raised by the Finance Minister to the Sheikh's Government and that if our Clients did not wish to mate any concessions at this stage the Colonial Office would give instructions that the Assent should be signed in its present form. It would now, however, appear that the secretary of otate also requires an alteration to be made. As we have informed our Clients that the Assent has been approved by the authorities, they are naturally very unwilling to make any further conces sions and express some eurprise that they should be requestedroquaated to do so. ;« do not baliayg that our Clients havo done thia because they wish to enforce against the Sheikh the strict tema of the Agreement aa thia would clearly be bad policy on their part but their attitude ia, that once an alteration auch aa this haa been made, the door ia open to further baxgainir^. 48 our Clients hate specifically stated that they are prepared to release the Sheikh frora liability for thefts by European enployees, we cannot advise than to extend such release to all employees excepting Bahrein natives, the reason being that jurisdiction under the Order in Council of 191v&gt; does not, apparently, extend to all foreigners, and in fact we understand from the India Office that it is questionable whether His Majesty haa jurisdiction over Persians of whom there must be a considerable number. Further, the duty of arresting offending foreigners who come within British juriadiotion is still caat upon the Jheikh and therefore it would appear to ua that there ahould be an inducement to cause him to effect an arrest. H agree, however, that if it is proved that the offender haa left the country, it would be unreasonable to bold toe Sheikh liable for hia miadeeda. fe have informed our Clients by cable of the Secretary of State* e request arid have sujested to them that a letter might be addressed to the Sheikh explicitly atating that his liability shall not extend to forei jnera coming within British juriadiction if such forei,jnera are arrested or escape from the country. Ie have no doubt whatever that when once our Clienta have corns &lt;mcad operations in the Si eikh'a territory, no difficulties will ariae under thia Clause and//y., and that if thay are satiafiad that the ihelidi ia carrying out his bargain to do his bast to arrest offenders, thay, on their part, will be reasonable and will not stand by the strict terms of the l ining Lease. We have perused the draft letter which you suggest should be written, and subject to receiting out Clients approval, we suggest that the terns of this letter should be araended somewhat on the lines of the draft which we enclose. la shall be obliged if you will let ub know if you approve of the grant of a letter on these lines and when we have heard from our Clients we will let you know if they are prepared to agree to it. Xhis matter appears to us to asstwe undue importunce and as pointed out above we do not think there is the least chance of our Clients bei'-n. unreasonable in their dealings with the Sheikh as any other attitude on their part would clearly not be in their interests. fa are, etc, (Signed) FRaSHFHLDS, MiSt i MUSSS, Die Under-Secretary of State, Colonial Office,/jrr'i oam Of uam m w miTTa -to e;.; aunw tw M a . a 't l(1 ■la further consideration of toe aosent of the Sheikh of Bahrein to the Assignment of the i&gt;ahrein Oil Concession dated the End December, 1925 to The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited, the said Company a .roes that 80 long aa the provisions of the Bahrein Orders in Council 1915 and 1922 or any Orders supplemental thereto remain in fores, and jurisdiction over certain foreigners in the State of Bahrein is exercised by His Majesty, the provisions in the second paragraph of iirticle VI of the Mining Lease (which forms the 3rd Bohedule to the said Concession) shall not apply in respect of the oonmission of any act of theft or damage by any parson (1) if on such J&gt;erson being arrested it is found that he is a foreigner over whom the jurisdiction exercised by His Majesty under the said Orders in Council has been extended, or (2) if, in the event of no arrest being made it is proved to the satisfaction of the Company or, if necessary, the Political ikgent, that ^he offender is such a foreigner as above-wentione^that he has left the territories governed by the Sheikh of Bahrein and has not to the knowledge of the Sheikh or his Officials returned thereto, and that no arrest could therefore be made.'FR^SHSI 8LDS, LKHSl &amp; MUTTT-'B.

The surface conditions prevailing on the Bahrein Islands have been minutely examined on behalf of 2he Eastenn and G -eneral Syndicate Ltd., by seven highly qualified oil geologists, from a geological stand point. The surface condi tions were examined to ascertain whether there is reasonable hope of discovering oil in payable quantity by drilling deep boreholes. The preliminary expense of engaging highly paid oil geologists to examine and report on the Bahrein Islands, has been exceedingly heavy, but small in comparision to the menetary outlay now necessary to prove by deep boring, if payable oil be present. The real knowledge as the value of any prospective oil bearing area can only be proved by the area being given the acid test of a comprehensive and carefully directed drilling programme.

When I made my first application (23-4-1928) the Political Agent of Bahrein at that time, informed me that His Excellency Sheikh Hamad was willing to grant the Company the additional area. I have no information that he has altered his attitude in this matter.

Sir I am directed Toy the Secretary of State for India to say that he has had under his consideration Mr. Willia.m , letter oi y&amp;n August, Ko. 79035/30/Pt. II f regarding the application made 'by the Eastern and General Syndicate for permission to negotiate with the Shaikh of Bahrain for the grant of an extension of the area covered by the Bahrain oil concession agreement. 2. On the question of procedure dealt with in para graph 2 of the Colonial Office letter, the Secretary of State agrees with the views of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. 3. As regards the application itself, however^ the Secretary of State feels strongly that it would 'be un desirable to grant any further concession - at any rate, at this stage. He is miich impressed by th ' s adduced by the Political Resident in his despatch, Ho.29 of 30th June, and agrees with him that it would 'be premature to consider any application for a further concession on behalf of the Bahrain Petroleum Co. until they have shown their ability to develop successfully the areas which they may select under the existing agreement. 4. Mr. Secretary Benn, moveover, adheres to the view which . ae Under Secretary of State, COLONIAL OFFICE, S.W.I.-2- which he has consistently taken, in the light of the considered opinions of the Government of India and the local political authorities, as to the complications likely to arise from the activities of America^ oil interests in the Bahrain archipelago. He reluctantly agreed to the assignment of the original concession held 'by the British syndicate 'because it was held that His Majesty f s Government had become in some measure committed to that course, 'but there is no similar reason for giving the syndicate a second concession for the purpose of their assigning it to the American interests# Mr. Benn considers also that the smallness of the area of the Bahrain principality constitutes an additional danger, having regard to the very extensive nature of the rights enjoyed 'by the jtompany under their present concession. 5.

Sir, I am directed by the Secretary for Mines to ^ I s'm refer to your letter of August 9th, No.79035/30/Part II . Pnn and to India Office lettTer lo»5i56/30 of September 11th, regarding an application by the Eastern and General Syndicate Limited, for permission to enter into negotiations with the Shaikh of Bahrain for the grant of an oil concession to extend over that part of the Bahrain Islands ( including their territorial waters) which is not covered 'by the Bahrain Oil Concession agreement of December 2nd, 1925, and to offer the following obser vations for Lord Passfield's information. (l) The Island of Bahrain has been included by the groups constituting the Iraq Petroleum Company in the area within which they have agreed that there shall be no competition for concessions amongst the various companies interested in the Iraq Petroleum Company» This arrange ment appears to have precluded the Gulf Oil Company from operating in Bahrain as a result of which it has assigned the rights acquired from the Eastern and General Syndicate to the Standard Oil Company of California, and the latter Company has in turn organised a Canadian subsidiary ( the Bahrain Oil Companyj to hold and operate the concession. The Gulf Oil Corporation of which the Eastern Under Secretary of State, COLONIAL OFFICE, s • W • 1. •Sastern Gulf Oil Company is a subsidiary is one of the independent United States Companies* The Standard Oil Company of California is a member of the well known group of Standard Oil companies in the united States ? and was incorporated as a consolidation of previous Standard oil companies, in Delaware in 1926. The Company is engaged in all 'branches of the Oil industry from prospecting to the distribution of refined products. It is engaged in actual drilling outside the United States in Colombia and Venezuela^ (2) The Petroleum Department are not aware of any British Company who would be likely, under present conditions ' to undertake oil exploration in the Bkhrain area. At one time the Anglo-Persian Oil Company were interested, but it is understood that their Geologists have now condemned practically the whole of the main land of Arabia. They had an option covering the territory of Bahrain until March 31st | 1925, and at one time offered to put down a test Well on the Island of Bahrain, if requested to do so. They did not, however, seem very enthusiastic over the project. It appears from previous correspondence that the IraQ. Petroleum Company has declined to consider the matter further. (3) The Eastern and General Syndicate do not seem to have put forward any specific reason for demanding an extension of their concession, and it is presumed that their object is mainly one of acquiring control over as large an area as possible before drilling is actually commenced. l?rom the point of view of the Shaikh of Bahrain, the concession is quite a favourable one, as the Royalty offered is | relatively(5) .. -3- relatively h.igh( a'bout 5/3 per ton) and if operations were carried out on 'behalf of either the Gulf Oil Company or the Standard Oil Company of California they would no doubt 'be I conducted in an efficient manner. (4) The Petroleum Department consider that the area which the Syndicate are already entitled to take up under lease ( of about 156 square miles) should 'be large enough to enable them to acquire control of a substantial oil field m the event of favourable indications being discovered as the result of drilling under prospecting licence. It should be remembered that the actual area covered by many puoved oilfields is by no means large. It was stated by the Chairman of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in 1926 that the proved area of the main producing field at Masjid-i-Suleiman in Persia only amounted to about 30 square miles. It is understood that as a result of further trial borings this area may now be said to amount to about 40 square miles ( the field is about 18 miles long x 4 miles wide at its widest z part). The new filled in South Persia at Haft Kel, which is 35 miles S.E. of the main oilfield, covers a structure of about 9 miles long by 2 miles wide. In Russia the producing area in Baku is only about 12 square miles in extent. The latter is rather an unusual case as the Baku field represents an exceptional concentration of oil. Nevertheless, it is considered that these instances are sufficient to show that after carrying out a campaign of prospecting drilling ovei xs the whole Island, the Company should 'be aole to protect it self adequatelyjby taking up an area of 156 square miles. This would still leave an area of 52 square miles on the main Island available for future concessions, whereas the Syndicate would have had the advantage of 'being first in the field and having first choice of areas.-4- (5) There is always the danger that a Company forced to demcircate tiie aroa of its concession before sufficient drilling has oeen done to enable the geological structure to be txxurougnly understood, may 'be unfortunate in tnat d. good oil producing structure may subsequently be discovered close to the boundary of the concession, with the result that companies granted subsequent concessions might be in a position to drain oil to some extent from territory held by the original concessionaire. Companies must, however, be prepared to take some risk in these matters, and if a certain amount of territory is withheld it might be extreme ly useful to H.M.Government in the course of later negotia tions as a bargaining counter. If the other concessions in which the Eastern and General Syndicate are interested on the Arabian coast are completed and transferred to the Bahrain Petroleum Company, the Standard Oil Company of California, through the Bahrain. Petroleum Company, would control a very considerable area in Arabia on the shores of the Persian Gulf. In practice, however, the investigations of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company have indicated that the prospects of finding oil are not very favourable, and it therefore sseems advisable to encourage the Bahrain Petroleum Company to undertake as much active prospecting as they are pre pared to do# (6) Reviewing the question generally both from the point of view of Bahrain and of the British empire, the Secretary for Mines is of opinion that no further con cession should be granted at present# We agree that from the technical point of view there are advantages in the operation..-5- operation of an oil field under single ownership which means that an economical drilling programme can 'be adopted with the definite object of high oil recovery at low cost and at a rate adjusted to meet the market demand • It is considered however that it would be to the advantage both of the Shaikh of Bahrair and of the British Empire to withhold further concessions at present as the concessionaires can be informed that their position will be reconsidered when they are in a position to show that they have carried out satisfactory development work on the property already conceded to them. Again, if a further concession is granted at this stage such a concession would finally exclude British Companies from participation, whereas if no concession is granted now it may be possible to secure some share to British Companies if oil is discovered in commercial quantities in the Bahrain Islands.
