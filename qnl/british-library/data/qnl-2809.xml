I consider success of the gendarmerie to be such an important factor in our efforts to extract order out of the chaos that I venture at the risk of incur ring your displeasure to add some arguments to those addressed in my official telegrams of yesterday in support of my opinion that it wnld be had policy to take any action such as appointment of a British of ficer to command Governor-General’s forces at Shiraz of a nature to lessen however slightly the prestige of the Swedes. I urn convinced that all chance of putting matters straight here depends upon gendarmerie. This opiiuon is shared by Russian Charge d’Affaires and 'omard. About a fortnight ago reviews of the cossack brigade and the gendarmerie contingent specially prepared for Fars took place on successive says. Deep impression was made by comparison between clap-trap circus per formance of the former with the soldierly bea mg and military precision of the latter none of whom had been more than six moivuhs with the colours. Cossack of ficersofficers themselves saw this and have begun to realize / that the da^/ for making ^ersia pay dearly for useless articles is past and that they must bestir themselves to make soldiers or not even Russian support will be able to save them from the open expression of public ridicule. Both Russian Legation and the cossack of ficers are making strenuous efforts to win good will of the Swedes. \ Rightly or wrongly general public hail gendarmerie as the British answer to the Russian cossack brigade and they are mrwly greeted in the streets 'the British Army'. Their popularity grows daily: even recalcit rant Persian Ministers are being won over and a feeling of pride in the possession of the gendarmerie js being engendered. The officers have of course made mistakes but it is unfair to say that they betray lamentable inability ir. dealing with finances, and unless I am. grossly mis informed some of the Swedish officers have made them selves beloved of their men a^d all are respected on account of their fairness though in the early days of their undertaking they ware perhaps unduly harsh.

TownUy to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 7.) ,i i , Tehran, March 17, 1913. e i 01 J, OU i }° re P ort that first detachment of the gendarmerie proceed.ng to Shtraz left lehran on the 28th ultimo and 1st instant, 468 men strong- with three Swedish offieers. _ I he men were at full strength with the exception of one corporal, who fell ill just before the start, and who will follow with the second detach ment at the end of next month, and one bootmaker, who deserted. In communicating to me the above details the colonel commanding informed me that no difficulty whatever had been experienced m the selection of men for the expedition, since the men had outvied each other in their desire to form part of it. Colonel Hialmarson followed himself by motor-car on the 11th instant. Unfortunately, since the departure of the detachment unsatisfactory news has been received from Bushire, where 168 men, practically the whole force that had been recruited there, have resigned their commissions, leaving the two Swedish officer instructors with only about thirty or forty men who accompanied them from Shiraz. The actual cause of the trouble would appear to have been the severity or nature of a punishment inflicted upon two of the recruits by Major Noren-Brandel, who had, I understand, a reputation for severity in his own country with recruits. The incident is an untoward one, as the men had been enrolled for the purpose of escorting a caravan of arms and ammunition up to Shiraz as soon as Colonel Hjalmarson had occupied the road in sufficient force. Sir Percy Cox telegraphs that this disappearance of the gendarmerie at Bushire would appear to be destined to delay indefinitely the transport of the arms and ammunition. He would appear to attribute the incident to the want of knowledge of Orientals possessed by the Swedish officers, but it would seem to me, from the description of these men previously given by Sir P. Cox, that they would have proved most unreliable material, upon which, I know, Colonel Hjalmarson set but little store. They were disbanded, disarmed, and dismissed from the island without causing undue trouble, though the night before their departure some shots were exchanged with the guard stationed at the quarters of the two Swedish officers. Before his departure for the south I discussed the situation fully with Colonel Hjalmarson, who has a very delicate and difficult task before him, which has not been rendered more easy by the nature of the instructions and advice given him by the Minister of the Interior, who appears to labour under the old Persian misapprehension that a rebellious chieftain is a much more valuable asset alive than dead. This is true if one only considers the pocket of the Governor-General, to whom he would pay ransom for his life, a fair share of which money eventually finding its way into the coffers of the Minister of the Interior. I told Colonel Hjalmarson that, in my opinion, should a chieftain come in and surrender after an encounter, he should be handed over to the local authorities after a court-martial had drawn up a report upon his case ; but that it would be much better that he should be made to fight for his life and lose it on the field of battle, as a warning to others. The Minister had represented that the death of a chief would be the signal for the whole tribe to rise and revenge him. There may, of course, be some risk of this, but it would hardly appear that the tribesmen of to-day are imbued with any deep feelings of affection and fealty for their leaders. In any case, if any real impression is to be made certain risks will have to be run, and it is desirable that the old principle of paying to live and fight another day should be abolished. It is possible, though generally considered here improbable, that tnis well-organised and powerful force will be recognised as the striking power of the Central Government, and that there will be no fighting. I was glad to find that Colonel Hjalmarson appeared to realise the dangers ahead of him, and did not make light of them. He expressed confidence in his men, who are of different type to the unwarlike townsmen he had had to enrol at first, and he expressed a belief that he could rely upon the present stuff to stand firm under fire.’ 'j /'V _ / /- I impressed upon the colone! that ^ su^p'ort other than purely mrhtary ones ; that he would no^ ^ ^ himse if in a difficulty, of the two legations, as he had done “ &gt; ^nnort of Maior O’Connor and although he could count upon * le ' 10l f 16 , r ‘ a ]] ph e local officials openly ort*&gt; I Sir P.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 9 of the 16th January, I hare the honour to forward to you herewith copy of a letter which I have received from Lieutenant- Colonel Douglas at Shiraz, offering some observations in connection with his views respecting the numerous occasions on which parties of the regiment have been fired at by natives since the date of their arrival in Persia. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel Douglas to Sir W. Townley. Sir, Shiraz, February 25, 1913. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge receipt of your despatch of the 16th January, enclosing a copy of your despatch No. 9 to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. I trust I may he permitted to offer the following remarks in explanation of the paragraph in my letter of the 19th December last to the Chief of the General Staff in India, to which your Excellency took exception as likely to create an erroneous impression in London. I attach a tabulated statement showing the occasions to which 1 referred on which parties of the regiment have been fired at by inhabitants of the country since the date of their arrival in Persia. It can, I think, hardly be contended that the majority of these -were not malicious attacks, and among the number I should include the occasion referred to by you on which two officers of the regiment were fired at within a few miles of the city. It is scarcely probable that they were not recognised, as they had been moving about, with their horses led behind them, for half an hour or more before the shots were fired ; and this opinion is strengthened by the fact that on the 20th December two officers shooting in the same direction were fired at from some gardens to the south-west of the city, and though it was impossible to say exactly where the shots came from, it is probable that they were fired by some of the same men. I may add in this connection, and Mr. Smart will doubtless confirm my statement, that the Governor-General at first expressed his inability to punish the man brought in, as he was unwilling to excite the hostility of a locally notorious scoundrel to whose following he belonged. It was only after considerable pressure that a nominal beating was inflicted, and no attempt was made to make use of him as a means of identification of the other men who were with him, and who were equally guilty. I cannot, of course, say whether their object was amusement or not, nor does it appear to me to materially affect the case. That several of the incidents were of themselves trivial I am quite aware, and I have no wish to attach an exaggerated importance to them, though in almost every casualties to men or horses might easily have occurred which would have considerably complicated the matter. Their significance from my point of view is mainly the effect they must necessarily have on the troops, and it was with the object oi emphasising the difficidties of our position here in this respect that I alluded to them in my despatch to the Chief of the General Staff. It is doubtless true that civilians are equally liable to be fired on, though I believe no such case has occurred since I have been in Shiraz, but I would venture to suggest to your Excellency that when a party o armed men comes under fire an entirely different situation is created. These^ men are trained to the belief that their arms are given them for self-defence ; that n attac e it is their duty to retaliate promptly, and they are perfectly ready to do so. t is [2874 k—1], X -U • +n hp nblio-ed to restrain them on the plea that therefore dlsl ? ea ^ teni ^ g ^aMhem have done so with the most innocent intentions. An the people who have fired at _ attached is not one which any officer would wish attitude of humility when msu command Nor is it always easy for officers to encourage among the men under J d the firers, and it is quite themselves to judge what particular which, in its political aspect, , conceivable that a “ e ttab i e * Moreover, should men of the regiment he ^ could only be considerec as display of the fact which took the form feeling light-hearted, they aie a ^ c i i seV ere punishment, and it is difficult of shooting at or near the passers ^ of ’ otllers who for them to understand why, when themselves ™ae ^ ^ feelincrs thev should adopt this method of giving expression to the exuberance of their lee 0 , y ^ ^ould ifte fhought'that I have laid undue stress on this aspect of the matter, I must ask your Excellency to excuse me m view of the fact that, though sufficiently Oh” ous to those whose duties include the training of troops, it may not be equally so t0 ^am forwarding a copy of this, and of your despatch under reference, to the Chief of the General Staff in India. ^ J.

He will of course try to arrange peaceful journey to Bushire and back, and will, I presume, modify his present plan of operations should the circumstances seem to require him to do so. Soulet promised me that he would prevent Mohammed Ali Khan’s men from opposing the gendarmerie, and would guarantee that the latter should be given peaceful possession of that section of the road. I can scarcely credit his ability to make good these assur ances, but I trust at any rate that he will use his influence, on the side of the gendarmerie. I do not think that I could properly have said or done anything further, and only trust that the situation may prove less serious than it appeared to me at Kazerun.” It is clear that the consul has made the situation quite plain to the Swedish colonel, who will, I hope, exercise caution. I have also explained the state of things to the Persian Government, who at once telegraphed a report of my conversation to the Governor-General. Short of causing the colonel to be forbidden to proceed we could do no more, and circumstances did not admit of such a drastic step, in my opinion.CONFIDENTIAL. i Sir W.

If the gendarmerie can count on the loyal support of local levies and of Soulet their task should not be an impossible one, but it appears to me from your description of the state of the road that a small force without guns will run a very considerable risk of suffering defeat, buch a fatal contingency should be avoided by all possible means, and for this reason you should, if there is still time, get into touch with the colonel, explain to him the situation as you see it, and seek his opinion as to whether it would not be better to await the arrival of reinforcements from here with guns before risking too much. He might perhaps content himself with occupying the road as far as Kazernn in force for the piesent. It would appear to me that a further delay of a month or two before bringing up arms and ammunition would be preferable to risking a disaster. It is not foi me to endeavour to influence the colonel’s decision, but it is our duty to put the situation clearly belore him if possible. I had hoped that he would have awaited your return to Shiraz before starting for Bushire, but I gather that he has already marched.

Again were British officers to be engaged for Pars, some slur would inevitably be ast upon the Swedish officers, who have been working hard and conscientiously for more than a year m Persia, and their position would suffer accordingly. The verv arguments used by Sir P. Cox and Major O’Connor that they are wanting in tact and experience of Orientals would be brought up against them. Very unfortunately, these defects in their character have been brought out somewhat glaringly at Bushire and ohiraz by officers who are peculiarly ill-suited for the delicate duties they have had to pertorm. borne of the officers now at Tehran have acquired no small knowledge of what may be called the diplomacy of a Swedish instructor’s life, and they are acquiring a certain insight into the difficult art of understanding and humouring Persians, whilst making them do their duty. I should be sorry indeed to see any obstacle put in their way after the really great fight they have made against Persian ill-will and obstruction. I should be obliged, Sir, if you would give a final decision upon this question. My views are entirely unbiassed. I am sure that British officers would do the work better than any others, but for the reasons given above I am strongly of opinion that it would not be politic to select any but Swedish officers for the work in hand. Sir P. Cox and Major O’Connor are equally strongly of the opposite opinion, and it makes a difficult task here harder to have to encounter their sustained opposition to what I have understood to be your opinion. I trust, Sir, that you will in no way consider my feelings should you think that the arguments put forward by Sir P. Cox and Major O’Connor have more weight than mine, seeing that they are more favourably placed than I am to judge of how far local conditions outweigh what seem to me serious political considerations. I have much pleasure in calling your special attention to Major O’Connor’s telegram No. 97, which contains an appreciation by Mukhber-es-Sultaneh of the fact [2874 c—1] COPY TO INDIA iECRITARY’g Im.T .ikof the gendarmerie that is highly satisfactory, and reveals, moreover, a more friendly feeling to that force on the part of the Governor-General than I had reason to believe existed at the present moment.

PARAMOUNT necessity in South Persia is restoration and maintenance of order, This can only be accomplished by armed force. If gendarmerie take over roads, Governor-General must still have a force wherewith to keep order among tribes and in outlying districts. In order to form such a force, arms and ammunition are required ; and in order that it may be efficient, European inspector and supervisor are indispen sable. It is true Governor-Generals new regiment is not making very satisfactory progress, but that is due partly to local intrigues, which can be eventually circumvented, and partly to lack of properjsupervision. But in any case men will sooner or later be forthcoming, if not from Ears, then from other parts of Persia. I am 'therefore of opinion advantage should be taken of this opportunity of procuring arms and ammunition. But I would at the same time venture to urge upon your Excellency necessity of securing services of European or American officer to organise provincial forces as a whole, and I would venture to suggest that although His Majesty’s Government do not approve of supply being conditional on employ of British officers, they might possibly consent to impose condition that officers of some other nationality should be employed. With such assistance there is no reason why good local force should not be raised, and I see no reason to suppose any friction need arise between them and gendarmerie which could not be easily allayed. In view of the fact that we are financing the administration, and that future order and collection of revenue depend on raising of efficient force, it is clearly to our interest to ensure that our expenditure produces proper result. I presume quantity of arms and ammunition sanctioned is that originally proposed by me, namely, 1,000 and 500,000 respectively. (Repeated Bushire 42.) Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P.

Please also see last part of Government of India’s telegram to Secretary of State for India, 25th February. With reference to above correspondence, I am in general agreement with the consul at Shiraz in thinking employment of European officer essential. But I am strongly of opinion that to be of any use they must be British Indian officers and no other. I have now had some months’ experience of the Swedes and their work. They are good men and true, but entirely lack experience of Oriental character, are slow to leam, and easdy imposed upon. It might perhaps be possible to find other foreigners less uncompromising and more tactful, but I do not know where we are to look for them. IVloicover, it seems to me that no detached handful ot European officers, who do not enjoy moral support of some manifest embodiment of force, can hope for success, and British officers are only category in regard to which the latter factor can be present! It must even be doubtful if British officers can cope with tribes of Ears until one section or other of them has been made a severe example of. But at all events their employment affords the best hope of success, and I therefore earnestly hope that His Majesty’s Government will be urged to reconsider their decision.

Enclosure 4 in No. 1. Shiraz, March 21, 1913. (No 94 ) Major 0 Connor to Sir W. Townley. (Telegraphic.) YOTTEt telegram No. 68. In the course of conversation with the Governor-General last night question of employment of foreigm officer to organise local forces cropped up and Governor-General expressed himself as strongly m favour of idea; he says principle of employing officer m capacity of inspectors or supervisors of Persian troops is^one which has been fccepted and acted on for many years past, and utility of which he thoroughly recognises Officer should, however only be employed as adviser and inspector, not as executive commandant, and provided this is understood, Governor-General would welcome employment of any foreign officer of suitable capacity and qualities including Swede to organise local forces. &amp; These views are in entire accordance with my own. My idea has always been that foreign officer should hold the same relation to Persian troops as do our inspecting officers of Imperial Service troops m a native State in India. I am, however, still very strongly of opinion that British officer would be more suitable than any other. Duties wou d require much tact, and knowledge of the language seems almost indispensable. O cer would have to interest himself in every detail, and would, in practice, have to ' control the whole organisation without openly appearing to do so, and would have to be in close friendly touch with Persian officers without allowing his influence to be seen too clearly. I was myself for some years with Imperial Service troops in Kashmir, and under stand something of the difficulties of the position and necessity for tact and knowledge of the language. ^ In these qualities Swedes with all their good points seem to be lamentably lacking, and, indeed, I know no other country than Great Britain which could produce exactly the suitable type of man. ’ In your telegram under reply your Excellency says that His Majesty’s Government do not concur with the Government of India in opinion that British officer would be suitable. I did not understand from Foreign Office telegram No. 109 that this was so. That telegram merely states that His Majesty’s Government do not propose to attach condition of employment of British officer to grant of arms and ammunition, which is quite a different matter. I, of course, realise that there may be reasons of State which deter His Majesty’s Government from sanctioning employment of British officer in Soutli Persia, but I venture very respectfully to suggestthat this might be reconsidered, as urged by Sir P. Cox in his telegram No. 131, with contents of which I am in entireagreement; and I again venture to express opinion that there is no reason to fear friction between gendarmerie and officer charged with supervision of local forces. Dutv of the latter would be merely to help to make an mdiilerent organisation effective, and this duty need in no way clash with duties of the gendarmerie officers. This opinion was much strengthened by views expressed by Governor-General last night regardii 9 gendarmerie generally, and which I am communicating to you in another telegram. In conclusion, I would beg very respectfully to represent to your Excellency that my views in this matter are shared by all Europeans on the spot most capable of forming sound opinion upon local conditions and qualities of Swedish officers as manifested here, and that they are shared by Sir P. Cox. And, if your Excellency sees no objection, I venture to suggest that they may be submitted to His Majesty’s Government, as employment of British officer in capacity suggested would, I think, go a long way towards restoration and maintenance of order in South Persia. (Repeated Bushire 64, who will please repeat to India.) Shiraz, March 21, 1913. Enclosure 5 in No. 1. Major O’Connor to Sir W. Townley. (No. 97.) (Telegraphic.) MY telegram No. 94. In conversation last night Governor-General expressed himself very frankly on subject of Swedish gendarmerie, and he asked me to communicate his views to you. In the first place he expressed his recognition of the many excellent qualities of the Swedish officers and his unqualified approval of the whole of the gendarmerie system which he has hitherto loyally supported, and will continue to support. He pointed out that when he arrived here the gendarmerie were under a cloud, and had suffered much in prestige, and were on bad terms with Kawam, &amp;c. Since his arrival he has encouraged Major Siefvert to dispose his men on the Bushire road, and result of limited experience has been on the whole highly satisfactory, has raised the prestige of gendarmerie, and augurs well for their future success on the whole of the main trade road from Bushire to northern frontier of Ears. Only adverse criticism Governor- General has to make is in reference to inexperience of officers themselves, which in the circumstances is inevitable, and they are reluctant either to seek or to follow advice of himself or other persons better equipped with local experience than they are. This attitude brings them into constant collision with local prejudices and leads to many quite unnecessary difficulties and misunderstandings, and tends to make force unpopular. Governor-General quoted specific instances in support of his views. He proposes to discuss matters frankly with commandant on arrival. I think on the whole Governor-General’s review of situation is a fair one. It is possible that he may at times have experienced some not unnatural irritation at attitude of Swedish officers, but I have no reason to think that he has ever failed in his support of gendarmerie as such. Attitude of Major Siefvert towards local authorities has of late been much more tactful and cordial, and I hope and believe that gendarmerie will eventually succeed in their difficult task. At the same time Governor-General’s remarks have convinced me more than ever that Swedes are not the persons best fitted to undertake reorganisation of Persian troops, and it would also appear probable that gendarmerie will continue to receive loyal backing from Governor-General even should that task be confided to officer of another nationality.

It seems certain that they will be opposed on the way, and I have written to Colonel lljalmarson indicating the difficulties which may be expected, so that he may not be unprepared. “ The task now confronting the gendarmerie is not really of a very serious military difficulty. The first step should be to take over the section of the road from Kazerun to Bahdar, about 10 miles, and then to move up the Shah pur valley and to crush Mohammed Ali Khan before proceeding further. “ These measures would involve considerable fighting, but the gendarmes could rely on the assistance of Kazerun and Kamarij riflemen, and perhaps of Soulet. “ Sufficient force would thus be raised, and under suitable leaders would undoubtedly succeed. “ But I feel very doubtful whether the Swedes possess qualities and abilities necessary for such an undertaking. We can, however, only await the result of their operations, and meanwhile I have impressed on all local persons concerned the necessity for co-operating ’oyally with the gendarmerie.” l 554—373 j[This Document is the Property of Eis Britannic Maiesty s Government . 1 mam road An officer of the gendarmerie, Captain Brandel, has been for some time at Bushire collecting recruits and taking delivery of a quantity of arms imported for the use ol the bars gendarmerie. He will await at Bushire the arrival of Colonel Hjalmarson at Shiraz, whose contingent of gendarmes will enable a detachment of that force to march south and join hands with Captain Brandel, thus providing a presumably sufficient escort to bring the arms in safety to Shiraz. ~ ‘ Major O’Connor, strongly supported by Colonel' Douglas, has represented to me that this movement will afford a suitable opportunity for the withdrawal of the Central India Horse from Shiraz. He points out the false position in which the regiment is placed, and the possibility of future unfortunate and embarrassing incidents to which its prolonged sta^ exposes the officers and men. He also indicates the local military measures which might be taken to effect this combined movement of the British Indian and the gendarmerie forces with the smallest amount of risk. I consulted His Majesty s resident at Bushire m regard to Major 0 Connor’s and Colonel Douglas’s proposals, and, as will be seen from the annexed correspondence, Sir Percy Cox replied that he considered that the question of the withdrawal should depend entirety on the policy of His Majesty’s Government, and could not be treated from a detached and local standpoint; that if His Majesty’s Government decided that they 'would take no action in the spring, but would wait on events until the autumn, the regiment should remain until that season. The policy of the withdrawal of the regiment was discussed very fully with you, Sir, last summer, and the decision was taken to give time to Mukhber-es-Sultaneh to restore order and to exact reparation for the attack on Mr. Smart and. his escort. Since then little change has occurred in the situation excepting the added seriousness resulting from the murder of Captain Eckford, and there has been no political development sufficient to justify my pressing on His Majesty’s Government a course wdiich almost necessarily entads an immediate decision with regard to their more general policy. The main consideration now advanced for an early withdrawal of the forces, viz., the military well-being of the regiment itself, appears to me one which should be more fitly urged on the Imperial Government by the Indian military authorities than by myself*, however much I appreciate its importance and soundness ; while my final views had better be reserved for any points on which His Majesty’s Government might wish to consult me if they are ready, at the instance of the Govern ment of India, to reopen the question at the present moment. I have accordingly advised Major O’Connor and Colonel Douglas in this sense, and the telegraphic correspondence, copies of which I have the honour to enclose, has been submitted by Sir P. Cox to the Government of India. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLE Y. MY telegram No. 19 of the 16th January.

[2836 /c—2] B2 commandant in Ears, when arrangement will be made to bring him up with arms and ammunition and recruits, all at the same time. I do not know exactly when this will be, but if commandant considered himself strong enough to make necessary arrange ments with first detachment from Tehran, backed by gendarmes already here and at Bushire, presumably journey could be arranged some time in April. It has occurred to me that in this event it would be excellent opportunity to arrange for return to India of the Central India Horse. I have hitherto refrained from addressing your Excellency specifically on this subject, but having read correspondence on this subject in my office, and studied the actual situation on the spot, I venture to recom mend that this regiment should leave Shiraz at the earliest possible moment. I think that it is now generally admitted that their dispatch was an unfortunate mistake. The first proposal, under which they were to escort caravans, having been shown to be quite impracticable, there remained no good leason why they should ever have been sent here at all. Cavalry are in any case practically useless on such a road as that between Bushire and Shiraz, and if reinforcements to consular guard here and at Ispahan they really needed infantry, who would have been in every way more suited to the purpose. Moreover, dispatch and presence here of this regiment have led directly to all the principal trouble and difficulties which have beset us in this province since last December year. Attacks on Major Birdwood’s and Mr. Smart’s escort differ from ordinary robberies by robber bands in that they were organised attacks by well-known villagers and tribesmen upon British troops. Since these first attacks a number of minor incidents have occurred, culminating m the death of Captain Eckford last month. Every one of these may be attributed directly to presence in Ears of this regiment. No blame can in any instance be attached to officers and men of regiment, whose conduct throughout, in most trying circumstances, has been beyond praise. But the fact remains that but for their dispatch and presence here such incidents could not have occurred. They are, in fact, in a false position, and must continue so until they are either removed or their injuries avenged. As regards the latter policy, it is to be hoped that in course of time (possibly during the ensuing summer or autumn) Persian authorities, with assistance of gendarmerie, may be strong enough to exact reparation from the principal culprits. At any rate, there is the possibility of something being done to enable them to do so, and sooner or later it is to be hoped that some effective punitive measures may be taken. But anybody acquainted with the internal condition of Persia knows that such measures cannot be taken immediately. Persia has no money and no armed forces, and to expect a country without either to take vigorous military action is to expect impossibilities. I am aware of argument which has been used, that to withdraw 7 regiment before reparation has been exacted wall involve serious loss of prestige ; but whilst sympa thising with it, I do not think it can be allowed to weigh very seriously in considerino 7 the question. If His Majesty s Government have the intention of themselves exacting retribution, regiment might with advantage remain here until the necessary steps had been taken, but if they do not intend to do so, I can see no good object in keeping the regiment here another day. As shown above, it v 7 ill certainly be months, and it may be much longer, before the Persian Government are strong enough to take punitive measures, anupt is clearly impossible to keep the regiment waiting here indefinitely for a consum mation which may conceivably take years to reach. Every day they remain here means fresh chances of embarrassing incidents, and I need not remind your Excellency of the inconvenience to officers and men of the regiment themselves, and of the useless expendi ture involved. r I am, therefore, for these reasons, very strongly of opinion that regiment should return to India as soon as possible. In my following telegram I shall indicate how I think this journey might be arranged. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Major O'Connor to Sir W. Townley. (INo. 30.) J (Telegraphic.) 1. .

I am not afraid that the regiment will be molested on their way to the coast, and it appears to me useless to keep the men indefinitely cooped up in Shiraz. It has occurred to me that you might perhaps^ prefer to march your men down independently of the gendarmerie, and 1 imagine that such a course would not entail any risk of attack. The conduct of the regiment whilst at Shiraz has been exemplary, and I should like to study your wishes as far as may be possible.” Enclosure 4 in No. 1. (No. 33.) (Telegraphic.) P. COLONEL DOUGLAS telegraphs as follows : Major O'Connor to Sir W. Townley. Shiraz, January 26, 1913. “ Persian assistance would not be of much use in case of serious fighting, and in any case I should, of course, much prefer to march the regiment down independently of the gendarmerie or other Persian support. An attack on the regiment is a possibility which must, in my opinion, be taken into consideration, though I do not myself consider it likely to happen. But I think we should be the better for some support, as1 If there are m any places on the road where a small force of cavalry encumbered by a large convoy would have to fight at a great disadvantage. A small force^of infantry sent from Bushire to Kamarij might afford this support. From Kamarij they could hold Tan^-i-Turkhan and afterwards assist in guarding dangerous defiles there and at Daliki. But if the political officers here and at Bushire consider the chances of our being attacked so small as to justify risk of journey, I am ready to move without the support indicated above. If military operations on a larger scale are not likely to take place in the near future the regiment would welcome orders to leave Persia, hut they would deeply regret missing any chance of exacting retribution themselves for the numerous attacks made on them by the tribesmen of Southern Persia. Enclosure 5 in No. 1. Sir W. Townley to Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Cox. (No. 43.) (Telegraphic.) P. Tehran, January 28, 1913. THE following are Colonel Douglas’s views on the question of the early withdrawal of the regiment from Shiraz ; in this connection please see all Major O’Connor’s previous telegrams on the subject. It appears to me that if we withdraw the regiment now it is equivalent to announcing that His Majesty’s Government do not contemplate a punitive expedition. But, apart from that, it seems to me that the suggestion is one which requires careful consideration, and I should be very grateful for your opinion. Colonel Douglas says :— [For text of Colonel Douglas’s telegram see Enclosure No. 4.] Enclosure 6 in No. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Cox to Sir W. Townley. Bushire, January 31, 1913. (No. 55.) (Telegraphic.) P. YOUlt telegram No. 43 of the 28th January. While sympathising fully with the regiment, the unsatisfactoriness of whose position I entirely appreciate, I do not consider that the question of their withdrawal can be treated from a detached and local standpoint. It should, in my opinion, depend entirely on the policy of His Majesty’s Government. If the latter decide that no action is to be taken in the spring, and that they will wait till the autumn and see what happens, then, in my judgment, the regiment should stay at Shiraz until the autumn. If His Majesty’s Government, on the other hand, state either in the spring or in the autumn that they have definitely decided not to take any active measures themselves, but_ are ready to give financial and moral support to the Persian Government until the latter are m a position to recover control and to restore order, then the intention of His Majesty’s Government to recall the regiment as a factor m that policy might be publicly announced at the same time and then be carried into effect. If the gendarmerie had not by then the Kazerun route as a whole sufficiently under their working control to preclude risk of attack, the regiment could be withdrawn via Ispahan or even by the Firuzabad route, as, after such a declaration, it would doubtless be quite possible to come to a friendly understanding with Soulet for immunity from attack in that direction ; my own personal opinion, however, is that the regiment should march out as through a friendly country, independently and on their own account, or, in the^ alternative, that they should be withdrawn incidentally in the course of adequate military measures taken by ourselves for the control of the road. I here are, m my opinion, grave objections to their extrication under the wing of the gendarmerie and the Governor-Generals force without any declaration or certain policy on the pait of His Majesty s Government. The arrangement might be welcomed by the gendarmerie and Governor-General, but a good deal of capital could be made out B by both, and fiom what we have seen recently both would probably make capital out of it. J Lastly, I do not believe that the military authorities would look at the suggestion that the small party here, acting as if in a hostile country, could or should march out %from Bushire and endeavour to hold the passes between Bushire andKazerun, including Tang-i-furkhan a proposal which, according to my own personal ideas, is altogether impracticable and unsound. Enclosure 7 in No. 1. Major O'Connor to Sir W. Townley. (No. 39.) (Telegraphic.) Shiraz, Februanj 1, 1913. FOLLOWING from Colonel Douglas :— “ I shall be grateful if you will inform me as soon as possible whether regiment is likely to be withdrawn in the spring or not, as in the latter case I must make arrangements immediately for supply of necessary stores and equipment.” Enclosure 8 in No. 1. Sir W. Townley to Major O'Connor. (No. 25.) (Telegraphic.) P. Bushire, February 2, 1913. I HAVE considered very carefully the question of the withdrawal of the regiment from Shiraz ; I have also invited the views of His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire on the subject. We both agree that* neither the time nor the manner of withdrawal are suitable, though we fully appreciate the unsatisfactoriness of the position from the point of view of the regiment, and sympathise with them most heartily. That the gendarmerie should escort a British regiment down the road to the coast does not seem to me seemly or in keeping with the dignity of the British army ; on the other hand, if the suggestion is adopted of detaching the British force from Bushire to march out and meet the regiment and accompany it over the difficult portions of the lower section of the road, I do not think it would be possible to prevent the tribesmen from thinking that it was a concerted movement to punish Mahomed Ali Khan Kashkuli or other suspected persons, in which case the regiment would probably be attacked at a disadvantage before a junction between the two parties had been effected. Further, the political horizon is by no means clear, it may well be that the mission of the Swedish gendarmerie ends in failure, and that Llis Majesty’s Government may find themselves obliged to abandon their present pacific policy in the autumn. It is true that the new Cabinet is a strong one, but they will be unable from want of money to carry on the administration unless a large loan is floated. It is therefore impossible to foretell what the future may hold in store for this country. I have also reason to believe that the presence of the regiment at Shiraz acts as a deterrent to certain elements antagonistic to the Governor-General whose position would in consequence suffer were the regiment to leave. I therefore consider it undesirable under the circumstances that the regiment should be withdrawn at the present moment. Prey express to Colonel Douglas and to the regiment my most sincere regret that I am unable to recommend their withdrawal this spring. You should also discuss the above with the Colonel. I have not yet referred the matter to Sir E. Grey because I felt that I could not recommend it, but I am quite ready to entertain and submit to His Majesty’s Government, should you so desire, any suggestions which appear to you and the Colonel more weighty than my reasons against withdrawal. Enclosure 9 in No. 1. Major O'Connor to Sir W. Townley. (Telegraphic.) Shiraz ’ February 3, 1913. YOUPv telegram No. 25 of the 2nd February. Following from Colonel Douglas : — “ I fully appreciate objections to any appearance of our moving to Bushire escorted by gendarmerie, but if O’Connor’s suggestion were adopted tins would largely [2836 k—2] Cbe obviated by our co-operating with them in bringing up their arms and ammunition. It is essential for this purpose that our troops should accompany gendarmerie from Bushire as well as from here, and in that case I think combined forces would be sufficiently strong to obviate any chance of attack by Kashkuhs. _ “ This arrangement is not ideal, but it appears to me that unless His Majesty’s’ Government are going to send an expedition in the autumn, in which case it would doubtless he better that we should stay, there is no hope of any improvement in the situation, nor is any more favourable opportunity for withdrawing us likely to occur then; and I cannot look with equanimity of prospect of the indefinite retention of regiment in Persia under circumstances which are necessarily injurious to its efficiency. “ It is not for me to give an opinion on the effect our withdrawal would have on local political situation, but I would point out to your Excellency that since January last year regiment has been treated not as an active force but rather as a source of embarrassment which it was desirable to remove on the first opportunity, and I can hardly think its retention in this position can have anything but a harmful effect on British prestige.” Enclosure 10 in Xo. 1. Major O'Connor to Sir W. Townleii. (No. 44.) (Telegraphic.) P. Shiraz, February 4, 1913. YOUB telegram No. 25 of the 2nd February. s Before opening a discussion on the subject of the withdrawal of the Central India Horse it must, I think, be recognised that the choice of two evils present itself to us His Majesty’s Government are necessarily placed in an awkward position by the presence of the regiment here in existing circumstances, and we are confronted with difficulties both in policy of retention and that of withdrawal. It is not an ideal solution which we must seek to obtain, but the one which is the least objectionable. With this point in view I will endeavour to reply to the objections which your Excellency and Sir P. Cox have raised to my proposals :— 1. Colonel Douglas, in my telegram No. 43 of the 3rd February, has answered your argument that it is not seemly that the regiment should travel to the coast under the wing of the gendarmerie. We could regard the move as a joint operation in which the cavalry are supporting the gendarmerie in accompanying their arms caravan up the road, and the gendarmerie act as escort to the cavalry in their march through mountainous country. As you are aware, the country between Shiraz and Bushire is very mountainous, and it can never from a military point of view be regarded as in any degree derogatory to the regiment that they should accept infantry escort for a march through such a country. Cavalry are quite incapable of protecting themselves effectively against attack on hilly roads among narrow paths and defiles, especially when encumbered with baggage train. Cavalry are practically helpless under such conditions, and their passage can be obstructed by a comparatively small body of armed hillmen, who can inflict heavy losses on them with impunity in almost every case. All soldiers are well aware of these elementary facts, which I simply allude to here to show that it cannot be regarded as undignified if a regiment is escorted by infantry. It would undoubtedly be preferable tliat British infantry only should act as escort, hut under the circumstances it is not possible to attain this ideal. 2. Witn reference to your objection that an attack on the regiment might be provoked by the advance of troops from Bushire, I concur in Colonel Douglas’s view thac the Ivashkulis would be the rather deterred than provoked by the strength of the combined forces. In my telegram No. 30 of the 23rd January I have referred to this point. I tlmiK eitner iorce would be strong enough to look after itself before the jauction was eftecfed, Bug some risks are inevitable whatever arrangement be made, and such usks would, I think, be minimised rather than increased by the dispatch of troops from Bushire. 3. Both Colonel Douglas and I recognise the force of your am-ument that the state of Peisia may eventually oiiige His Majesty’s Government to intervene. Our telegrams to you make reference to such possibility. His Majesty’s Government woulu peihaps prefer to retain regiment at Shiraz, if they consider that disorder in feoutiiein Feisia is likely to compel their intervention in the autumn but I imagine they would much prefer to withdraw it as soon as possible if there is any uncertaintyabout the matter, thereby putting an end to the embarrassing situation in which both they and the regiment find themselves. 4. I do not share jour Excellencys view that the withdrawal of the regiment might embarrass the Governor-General. But I hardly think that, even supposing this were the case, such a consideration could be advanced as a serious argument against withdrawing the regiment at a moment most convenient to His Majesty’s Government. It was not with a view of supporting the authority of the Governor- General that the regiment was sent to Persia, and I do not imagine that its retention here lor that purpose would be allowed by His Majesty’s Government or the Government of India. I he retention^of a smart Indian cavalry regiment cooped up in gardens round Shiraz and debarred from active exercise of their military duties can hardly be considered the^ best way of supporting the provincial administration of Ears, if it is desired that British pfficers or troops should support that administration, and there are many better ways in which British officers or troops might be utilised for the purpose. The following, in short, appear to me to lie the arguments put forward in favour of retaining the regiment here : although its presence in Shiraz causes expense and inconvenience to all concerned, although the fact is admitted that under present conditions the regiment is practically useless, although numerous embarrassing and some tragic incidents have resulted from its presence here in the past, and although similar incidents may possibly occur in the future, yet its retention here is considered the best policy to adopt on the chance that His Majesty’s Government may find themselves forced by the failure of the administration of Southern Persia to send an expedition to effect a restoration of order rather than to face some risks and a possible loss of dignity by allowing the gendarmerie to escort it to the coast in the spring. Your Excellency and Sir P. Cox are of opinion that it is not suitable to withdraw the regiment either at the time or in the manner proposed by Colonel Douglas and myself, yet your only counter-proposal is that it should stay here till a British expedition is perhaps eventually dispatched ; but supposing such an expedition is not dispatched, I fail to see that we shall find a more suitable occasion later on for the withdrawal of the regiment. It is only postponing the inevitable on the off-chance that His Majesty’s Government will dispatch an expedition, and His Majesty’s Government might, in a far-off eventuality, be led by such postponement to send an expedition for the purpose of withdrawing regiment, which necessity they would, I presume, like to avoid. We should be glad if you would lay our views before His Majesty’s Government; but, before doing so, would your Excellency sound the colonel commanding the gendarmerie on the subject. It is possible that he would refuse his consent to the proposed plan, in which case we should have to reconsider the whole subject. Enclosure 11 in No. 1. Major O'Connor to Sir W. Townley. (No. 46.) j Shiraz, Fobituary 5, 1913. CONTINUATION of my telegram No. 44 of the 4th February. I have omitted hitherto' to refer to question of relief of consular infantry escort. If proposal for withdrawal of cavalry regiment in the spring should meet with approval, I suggest also that advantage should be taken of the opportunity co effect relief of infantry escort, which is already some months overdue. The present strength of escort is one British officer, one native officer, and fifty-seven men, and it will presumably be relieved by detachment of the same strength. Thus force of some sixty infantry would be added to both columns. Believed escort would travel to Bushire with cavalry, and relieving escort could accompany arms caravan and gendarmerie back to Shiraz. [2836 /f—2] D8 Enclosure 12 in No. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Cox to Sir W. Townley. (Telegraphic ) P Bushire, February 5, 1913. IT would seem to meet requirements if I wait till Saturday before repeating to the Government of India O’Connors telegram No. 44 of the 4th February. Your telegram No. 52 of the 2nd February has not yet been repeated to Delhi as it arrived after the departure of the mail, but the rest of the correspondence has been posted in the course of ordinary routine and should reach the Government of India on Saturday. I do not desire to make any comment on O’Connor’s present observations; the following consideration does not, however, fall naturally within the purview or the Shiraz consulate, and I may perhaps mention it. At the present moment we are U up against” Taugistan. Firstly, we are blockading the coast against arms traffic; and secondly (please see my despatch No. 24 in transit to you), we have under contemplation punitive action against coast villages in connection with a very serious case of piracy. In the meantime the governor, whom the tribes m the hinterland regard with hostility, has no force at all at his disposal to maintain security, and if it had not been for the presence of our troops here Bushire itself would certainly have been attacked last November when the road just outside was blockaded. The Bushire road would clearly be left in a weak position were the 200 odd infantry here to leave on the mission suggested, and both the opportunity and the excuse would be afforded to any malcontent tribesmen anxious to make difficulties for the governor or to annoy us. In order to secure the position here I might therefore be compelled to ask that new troops should replace the absent ones. Enclosure 13 in No. 1. Major O'Connor to Sir W. Townley. (No. 49.) (Telegraphic.) P. Shiraz, February 6, 1913. COLONEL DOUGLAS asks me to telegraph as follows :— “ Please see last paragraph of your telegram No. 53 to Foreign Office dated the 4th February. “ I will not, of course, ask for the withdrawal of the regiment in the spring if there is any question of their being actively employed during the summer. But it would be of great assistance to me if I might be given some idea as to when, in normal circumstances, I may expect regiment to be withdrawn or replaced. There are certain other aspects of our position here, such as the impossibility of replacing casualties, especially those among horses, which make indefinite stay at Shiraz under present conditions extremely difficult.” I beg to support views expressed by Colonel Douglas. It is chiefly because of the present enforced inactivity of the regiment that we both consider their early withdrawal advisable, but of course their presence here during the spring and summer might prove of great value if the Foreign Office adopt the suggestion put forward in your telegram as to allowing regiment to intervene actively in protecting the city. Enclosure 14 in No. 1. Sir W. Townley to Major O'Connor. (No. 35.) (Telegraphic.) P. _ Bushire, February 6, 1913. I HAVE come to the conclusion after a most careful consideration of your telegrams Eos. 44 and 46 of the 4th and 5th February, and after a close examination of all the arguments in favour of and against the withdrawal at the present moment of the regiment from Shiraz, that the military considerations of the question so far outweigh the political ones that the best course to adopt would be for Colonel Douglas to submit the matter for the opinion of the Indian military authorities. Should the Government of India (to whom it appears from Sir P. Cox’stelegram No. 66 of the 5th February all.the correspondence has been submitted) consider that the withdrawal of the regiment would be justified from the military point of view by the arguments adduced, they will doubtless seek the views of His Majesty’s Government, who will ask me in their turn for my own. - Colonel Hjalmarson has no objection to the proposal, but before giving me a definite Inswer is asking Major Siefvert confidentially for his opinion. The colonel is quite convinced that he will be obliged to fight either on his way down to Bushire or on his return journey. Enclosure 15 in No. 1. Major O'Connor to Sir IF. Townley. (No. 51.) (Telegraphic.) Shiraz, February 7, 1913. PLEASE refer to Bushire telegram No. 66 of the 5th February. I venture to suggest for your Excellency’s consideration that difficulties in the Persian Gulf constitute no argument in favour of retention of an Indian cavalry regiment in Shiraz. If, as Sir P. Cox anticipates, dispatch of 200 infantry from Bushire on a minor expedition which should not last more than a fortnight would seriously imperil the safety of Bushire and would interfere with punitive measures on the Gulf littoral, it would seem possible to reinforce Bushire temporarily from Task, or by landing party of bluejackets. At any rate, this is question of detail which does not materially affect arguments bearing on the desirability or otherwise of withdrawal of regiment.confidential. Sir W.

Enclosure No. 4. Telegram P., No. 76, dated (and received) the 8 th March 191S From—His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, To—His Majesty's Minister, Tehran. (Repeated Resident, No. 41.) I have the honour to refer to my telegram No. 72. The following proposals have been made by the Governor-General in order to maintain order during the coming tribal spring-migration. He proposes to send the Qawam-ul-Mulk to Fasa with 1,200 men and to the other eastern districts where he will be in a position to restrain the Baharhis and the Arabs, and to effect some collection of revenue. About 300 horsemen and about 400 riflemen will be enlisted by him for the purpose of this expedition. Stas can meet from savings on his budget estimates the extraordinary cost of these measures, over and above the cost of the troops already paid out of the budget, the estimated cost being about 20,000 Tomans. The force will be accompanied by a financial agent, who will exercise supervision and control over all expenditure. The Qawam will be required to furnish written guarantees that the sanc tioned estimate of expenditure shall in no case be exceeded. Provincial autho rities are able to take these measures without being under the necessity of asking the Persian Government for funds. In view of previous correspondence I have hesitated to recommend these proposals to Your Excellency, but having regard to the fact that the Qawam has not been removed from the province by the Persian Government, I am in accord with the Governor-General in thinking that it is better that he should he actively employed than that he should remain idle in Shiraz while the tribes pillage the country unrestrained. There is always a recrudescence of robbery, and there is no doubt that the condition of affairs will daily grow worse. I need not urge the desirability of early consideration being given, and an early decision arrived at with regard to the above proposals. Should further details be desired, I will furnish them by telegraph.Enclosure No. 5. Telegram P., No. 80, dated (and received) the 8th March 1913. From—His Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, To—His Majesty's Minister, Tehran. (Repeated Resident, No. 42.) ~ Your telegram No. 60. The restoration and maintenance of order is the paramount necessity of Southern Persia. Only armed force can accomplish The Governor-General, if the Gendarmerie take over the roads, must still have a force wherewith to keep order in outlying districts. Arms ancLammuni- tion are required in order to form such a force, and in order that it may be efficient, it is indispensable that it should be inspected and supervised by Europeans. 1 J The Governor-General’s new force, it is true, is not making very satisfac tory progress, but that is due partly to local intrigue, which can in the lon°- run be circumvented, and partly to the absence of proper supervision. In any case, however, sooner or later men will be forthcoming, if not from Ears then from other parts of Persia. I am of opinion therefore that we should take advantage of this opportunity of procuring arms and ammunition. At the same time, however, I would venture to urge on Your Excellency ! the necessity for procuring the services of European or American officers for the purpose of organising the provincial forces as a whole, and would venture the suggestion that though His Majesty’s Government do not approve of the supply of arms and ammunition being conditional on the employment of British officers, yet it is possible that they might consent to the imposition of the condition that an officer of some other nationality should be employed. There is no reason why local forces should not be raised with such assist ance, and I see no reason to suppose that any friction need arise between them and the Gendarmerie which should not be susceptible of adjustment. Having regard to the fact that we are financing the administration and that the future collection of revenue and maintenance of order is contingent on the raising of an efficient force, it is clearly to our interests that we should ensure that the proper result is produced by our expenditure. 1,000 rifles and 5,00,000 rounds, the quantity originally proposed by me is, I presume, the quantity of arms and ammunition now sanctioned. * Enclosure No. 6.

No direct representation regarding the removal of the Kawam has as far as I am aware been made by the Governor-General to the Persian Government. The first step should come from His Excellency if such action was to be taken officially, but it would have been very difficult to execute such a measure, as there is no Governorship at present vacant, which it would be possible to offer him. The Governor-General perhaps hesitated before taking a leap in the dark which, in the absence of any regular force to support him, would have left him on the Kawam’s departure without any local element of moderate ability to back him up. 1 Speculation as to what may or may not be at the back of the Governor- General’s mind is not likely to be of any use, and it would appear in the circumstances that the Kawam would be better employed in active work outwardly, at least, under the Governor-General’s orders, and under the supervision of the agent, than that he should remain idle in Shiraz for we have all been taught who it is who finds work for idle hands to do. ^ k course possible that Kawam’s position may be strengthend in future by success in his mission, and that this may make it more difficult to remove him, should the necessity for taking this step continue to exist, but that is a point which we can tackle later on when occasion arises.

If no funds are forthcoming for the USe x ( i 2 . aaminis tration, the position here will be very difficult during the next financial year. The provincial treasury is empty, and there is no hope of any revenue coming in until July, and not even then, unless order has been re-established, and unless forces are placed at the disposal of the Governor- General with which^ he can enforce his orders. Mukhbir-es-Sultaneh is in communication wdth the Persian Government, and I believe he has asked them tor 20,000 tomans, with which to raise, as a' temporary protective measure, levies from the tribes. The Persian Government will no doubt consult Your Excellency with reference to this proposal. Por the moment the most urgent question is the enlistment of 300 sowars, as suggested in my telegram No. 59. Sufficient funds can he saved out of the budget estimates to pay for these for threel, months, and with yonr sanction, the necessary arrangements could be put in hand forthwith. I fear ^ that the Governor-General’s new regiment promises to he a complete failure. Only 120 men have been enlisted after three months’ efforts, and those are not of a very suitable type. Both the treasury Agent and I think that it will he necessary to tell the Governor-General that in view of the unsatisfactory nature of the arrange ments made by him, we are unable to recommend further expenditure on these troops after Nau Buz. Besides the gendarmerie, therefore (who will presumably he exclusively occupied for some time to come to the Bushire road), the provincial forces available to cope with disorder in the spring will consist of a few hundred old sarbazes, and perhaps five hundred horsemen of a sort. The immediate appointment of a European (not a Swede) to or ganize and supervise local forces to some extent is the only possible solution to the impasse which I can suggest. Without European supervision, local forces are a hopeless rabble. The provision of funds is however the essential preliminary to all arrangements of any kind.

With regard to the position of the regiment at Shiraz, it had been so difficult that the time had come when it was really a primary consideration to give it relief by withdrawal as soon as possible, and that withdrawal was going to be carried out. There was no object in its being retained at Shiraz under present circum stances. If we were to have a force in Southern Persia which was really to affect the conditions and be effective for any pur pose, it ought to be a much larger force.

R. 7 YOUR telegram No. 169 I have discussed the question of a force for Luristan with the Russian Charge d’Affaires. He has expressed the opinion, which I share, that an irregular Persian force is more likely to add to the confusion and sufferings of the people than to do good. He thinks that more use should be made of the Cossack brigade, which costs the Persian Government a large sum of money, and is of small practical value. He suggests that, as the gendarmerie is not at present strong enough to send a force, 300 or 400 Persian Cossacks under Persian officers should be sent. They are a drilled force, and if need be a Russian officer could easily go to Sultanabad from time to time to see that all is well. It is generally recognised that Russia is beyond Cossack brigade ; this knowledge and the fact that force is disciphned should' render it sufficiently strong for the purpose in view. The Russian Charge d’Affaires also told me that 100 Persian Cossacks have been sent to Sullduz, where disorder, since the Persian Government took over administration after the evacuation of the district by Turks, has become unbearable. Persian Cossacks are also being used on Tabriz-Akher road in order to support certain tribes who are threatened by Shahsevans in consequence of assistance which they rendered to Russian expedition last year. These movements of Cossack brigade entail certain development of the sphere of action of this force under Russian officers, but it can hardly be objected to under the existing circumstances, I think. r- v- r\ ~ t u - / ' '&gt; 4AFi ^'9l V yv.CONFIDENTIAL, Sir Edward Grey to Sir W.

I would beg leave to call your attention to the lucid and thorough manner in which the aims, ambitions, and objects of the several warring factors in Ears have been classified and summarised. The despatch is a document of great value for anyone who is desirous of arriving at some understanding of the rival pretensions which make it almost impossible to foresee a satisfactory solution of the problem, as long as the repre sentative at Shiraz of the Central Government is precluded by the weakness of the same from playing a bold part sustained by the force of arms. The final deduction that peace cannot be assured “until the tribe which attacked m pitched battle the regular troops of the Power hitherto most feared m Ears has been called to account” is peculiarly apposite at the present moment when the steps to be taken to punish a tribe for a similar offence, though possibly with a different motive, are under serious consideration. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. 1. Acting Consul Smart to Sir W. Townley. &lt;No. 22. Confidential.) Si r &gt; Shiraz, October 30, 1912. THE present lull, after the southward migration of the tribes and the arrival of the new Governor-General, would seem an appropriate time for a review of the general situation in Ears during the past six months. In my despatch No. 9 of the 23rd May last I endeavoured to represent the situation such as it was after the defeat of Soulet-ed-Dowleh and his retirement to the lowlands around Firuzabad. The following two months were a period of extraordinary calm as far as the neighbourhood of Shiraz was concerned. Indeed, I have never, during my two sojourns at Shiraz, known the vicinity of the town so peaceful. However, the improvement in the situation at and around Shiraz was not reflected on the trade routes or in the outlying districts. This unexpected peace was due partly to the appeasement of the Kashgai-Khamseh strife, partly to the skilful administration of Kawam-ul-Mulk, and partly to the salutary effect produced by the downfall of a chieftain, around whom a legend, highly detrimental to the authority of the Government, had grown up. But it soon became evident that this peace had no elements of stability in it. The main factors in its break-up were the question of the attacks on our troops and the pretensions of Mohammed Ali Khan Kashkuli. The ilkhani in the north was, with some severity, endeavouring to obtain a real control over the tribes. He had imprisoned Ayyaz Kiha, the Kalantar of the Darashoori section of the Kashgais. This chief, responsible for many of the Kashgai robberies of recent years, was the last kalantar to abandon Soulet-ed-Dowleh, and his final submission was of doubtful value. He was replaced by Ali Penah Kiha, a strong partisan of the ilkhani, and the allegiance of the important Darashoori tribe was thus secured. The majority of the Shishbulookis, who effectively guarded the Sarhad route, were loyal, and even paid some maliyat. The chiefs of the Earsimadani tribe, which was [2763 n —15] ® —y X _ _ ... ... .. \ f”cGPY H) b-MA : 28tv^ 9l \ I ' ■ SECRETARY'S N 2 &amp; 3retained near Shiraz, were also loyal, but their control over their followers many or whom were far from loyal, was very slight. The Kashkulis, who controlled the upper part of the Bushire road, were perhaps the strongest supporters of the Government. The lesser tribes were easily kept submissive. Gradually the llkhani was consolidating his position, endeavouring to collect maliyat. It is faiily certain in the adminis tration of the tribe he displayed considerable rapacity, which alienated many sympathies. His administration of Abadeh, through Amir-ul-Mulk, differed little from the normal, rapacious, tribnl government m the Fars districts, and even provoked a bast of several Abadeh notables in the Indo-European telegraph office there. By _ direct, friendly negotiations I was able to induce Amir-ul-Mulk to come to terms with the “ bastis/’ who finally left the telegraph office. _ Yet the general tendency of the ilkhani’s tribal administration was good from the political point of view. He was obviously 'endeavouring to bring the Kashgai tribes under the control of the Government, which, however, was unable to lend him the necessary support for the attainment of tins object. Probably few of the kalantars viewed with favour this growing consolidation of the ilkhani’s power, but there was one kalantar whom it gravely menaced. That kalantar was Mohammed Ali Khan. This chieftain had long been the mainstay of Soulet-ed- Dowleh, and the withdrawal of his support from Soulet-ed-Dowleh had been the main factor in the latter’s downfall. He is at present the most powerful of the Kashgai kalantars, though he has many enemies, even among the Kashkulis. Fie was quick to realise that the consolidation of the ilkhani’s power would not only prejudice his advantageous position, but would even involve him in considerable personal danger. Kawan-ul-Mulk and the ilkhani were pressing him hard for the surrender of the culprits of the attacks on our troops. If the ilkhani were allowed to grow much stronger, this pressure might take the form of forcible action. Mohammed Ali Khan began to show signs of restlessness. He demanded the release of Ayyaz Kiha, knowing that it would strike a fatal blow at the ilkhani’s power. Sardar Ihtisham and Kawam-ul-Mulk refused to entertain his request in spite of many menacing letters and veiled threats of secession to Soulet-ed-Dowleh. I am inclined to think that the Persian Government missed their chance by postponing all action pending the arrival of the Governor-General. If at the end of June, when it became apparent that Mohammed Ali Khan would not surrender the culprits, the Persian Government had ordered Kawam-ul-Mulk and the ilkhani to proceed to punitive measures for their apprehension, it is just possible that the under taking might have been successful. Mohammed Khan, cousin and bitter rival of Mohammed Ali Khan, expressed the opinion, in the course of a visit he paid me towards the end of August, that the most urgent need of the situation was not action against Soulet ed-Dowleh, but action against Mohammed Ali Khan. The sequel was to show that this opinion, though prompted by personal animosity, was correct. At the beginning of July Mohammed Ali Khan’s position had considerably weakened. Mohammed Khan could no doubt have detached a large part of the Kashkulis, and the other tribes, jealous of the predominance of the Kashkulis, could probably have been put in motion against Mohammed Ali Khan. Failure to seize the favourable moment gave Mohammed Ali Khan time to organise his plot, which resulted in the recovery of his power and the downfall of the ilkhani. Meanwhile, Kawam-ul-Mulk was making arrangements to deal with the Khamseh tribes, whose lawlessness had passed all bounds. 1 strongly suspect that he had, through his deputy, Mirza Fazlullah Khan, sown discord between the Jabbara and Shaybani sections of the Arabs, with a view to facilitating punitive measures against the divided tribes. Unfortunately, his departure, long delayed by the refusal of the Persian Government to allow him to leave Shiraz, was rendered impossible by the forward movement of Soulet-ed-Dowleh. About the middle of July Soulet-ed-Dowleh began to show signs of restlessness. His bands began to raid Kevar and to attack caravans of local produce going to and from Shiraz. A small force of Farsimadanis under their chief, Masih Khan, was sent to Kevar to watch these banas. ^ At the end of July a mixed force, 500 strong, composed mainly of Surkhis and other Kumarrehis, of villagers from Firuzabad and other lowlands, under the command of Hassan Khan Kashkuh, brother-in-law of Soulet-ed Dowleh, advanced through Khojeh and. drove the Government garrison of some fifty Kashkulis, under Ghulam Hussein Khan Kashkuh, out of Darangan. This development resulted m the closing of the Chenai liahdar—Khan-i-Zmiyan stage of the Bushire road and the exposure of the Shiraz valley to periodical raids. Kawam-ul-Mulk began to collect an expeditionary force to reoccupy Siakh, and, ifpossible, to pursue the marauders to Firuzabad. In reply to his summons, some 800 Arabs, under Mohammed Kuly Khan, brother of Asker Khan, the Shaybani chief, and 200 Baseris came into the town. They were followed by about 200 ^ Kashgais, under Samsam-es-Sultan, a khan of the reigning family. Another * 200 Kashgais—Farsimandanis and Kashkulis—were also in the town. Arrangements were made for the collection of another force of Kashkulis and Farsimandis around Khan-i-Ziniyan. While this expedition was being organised Major Siefvert with 260 gendarmes occupied Chenar Kahdar, with the object of watching the first stage of the Bushire road, of preventing incursions into the Shiraz valley from Siakh, and, if he considered it advisable, of subsequently co-operating with the Government army against Siakh. I have reported by telegraph the unexpected, single-handed move made by Major Siefvert against Siakh. I have subsequently questioned Major Siefvert as to what his intentions were in making this movement. 1 gather that he proposed to march to Darangan, spend the night there, and return on the next day to Shiraz via Karabagh. Apparently he thought this military promenade would present few difficulties. He doubtless underestimated the fighting value of his opponents and overestimated that of his own men. Fath-ul-Mulk, one of the gendarmerie officers, who, formerly in the local Government cavalry, had served in many expeditions and fought last spring in this very district of Siakh against Soulet-ed-Dowleh, told me that he and other Persian officers pointed out to Major Siefvert the impossibility of the undertaking.. To add to its difficulties, the gendarmes were not provided with water- bottles, and had to march some 10 miles through a waterless region under a blazing sun. Parched with thirst and having little stomach for a fight, they were easily defeated by Hassan Khan’s force, posted in the fortified hillocks covering Darangan. The greater part of the gendarmes surrendered witiiout much hesitation, and finally Major Siefvert and Captain Nystrom with a few men had to beat a hurried retreat. They fortunately succeeded in escaping, though Major Siefvert was slightly wounded in the stomach. The enemy released all the prisoners after stripping them. About 150 rifles and 16,000 cartridges fell into the hands of the enemy. One mountain gun, the breach of which had exploded, was abandoned on the field. The casualties were slight —two gendarmes killed and a dozen wounded, of whom two afterwards died in town. Soulet-ed-Dowleh subsequently expressed his regret at this incident, and promised to restore the captured arms and munitions, but he has not yet put his promise into execution. This disaster, apart from its bad effect on the future prospects of the gendarmerie, had a deplorable influence on the situation. Had Major Siefvert remained at Chenar Bahdar, he could have rendered the Government useful service in escorting caravans over the first and dangerous stage of the Bushire road, in deterring Hassan Khan s men from their frequent raids into the Shiraz valley. After the withdrawal of the gendarmerie, caravans bad to proceed under expensive Kashkuli escorts by a detour through the Tang-i-Surkh, and on one occasion Hassan Khan’s men actually raided the Shiraz valley between the town and Chenar Bahdar. Moreover, this defeat of a Government force greatly increased the audacity and prestige of the rebels. Meanwhile serious discord had inopportunely broken out among the Arabs. Oyer half the Arab contingent left Shiraz for the scene of the strife. The two parties, Jabbara and Shay ban i, sat opposite each other in hostile formation around Murghab for a considerable time. However, both sides apparently decided that prudence was the better part of valour, and no further hostilities followed those which had marked the outbreak of the quarrel. Jabbaras and Shaybanis, in a state of armed and watchful distrust, began to migrate southwards, and gradually separated as their lines of migration diverged. Much bad feeling was occasioned among the Arabs by this discord, which they openly attributed to Mirza Fazlullah Khan, Kawam-ul-Mulk s deputy. The result of this inopportune outbreak was that Kawam-ul-Mulk was deprived of imaluable Arab support for his expeditionary force. His inability to go out among the Arabs and profit by the discord he himself had probably sown has seriously prejudiced any chance he may have had of reducing the Khamseh tribes to relative obedience m the near future. _ . At the end of August Mohammed Khan Kashkuli arrived at Shiraz. His preseiice was urgently needed to set the expeditionary force in motion. He had been de aye y quarrels with Mohammed Ali Khan. On the 2nd September the Government ou ®’ consisting mainly of Kashgais, with a few “ sarbaz,” local sowars, and one gun, move out of town. About the same date Soulet-ed-Dowleh appeared in person at aiangan. I doubt whether the full Government force numbered more than 600 men, an i vane “Considerably, many of the tribesmen coming and going according to the requiremen s o4 their private affairs. The army never got beyond Chenar Itahdar, developments m the north suddenly transferring the centre of interest from Siakh to Baiza. The ilkhani had been collecting a force and was moving southwards. Soulet-es- Sultaneh, Soulet-ed-Dowleh’s full brother—a weak, vaccillating character had in the spring, after many hesitations, thrown m his lot with Sardar Ihtisham and beenp appointed ilbegi. His loyalty was, however, dubious, and he was known to be ambitious of becoming ilkhani. At the beginning of September the ilkhani discovered that Soulet-es-Sultaneh was plotting to bring down some of the tribes to join Soulet-ed- Dowleh. Salar Hishmet, the^ilkhani’s full brother, attacked and utterly defeated Soulet-es-Sultaneh near Asepas. Soulet-es-Sultaneh escaped with the utmost difficulty to Baiza, where several of the smaller tribes, who had revolted against the exaction of “ maliyat,” gathered round him. At this juncture the ilkhani showed a deplorable lack of decision and energy. Had he marched promptly to Baiza he could probably have dispersed with little difficulty the insignificant following then round Soulet-es-Sultaneh. Instead of taking such prompt action he advanced in a very dilatory manner, giving Mohammed Ali Khan, who had moved from Ardekan, time to join Soulet-es-Sultaneh. Negotiations for peace ensued, Mohammed Ali Khan all the while pretending to be neutral and actuated by the amiable desire of effecting a general reconciliation. It soon became evident, however, that Mohammed Ali Khan, with the help of Haji Mohammed Kerim Khan, the arch-mischiefmaker among the Kashgais, was plotting the ruin of Sardar Ihtisham. He and several lesser chief’s around Soulet-es-Sultaneh telegraphed to the Persian Government and Mukhber-es-Sultaneh that they were dissatisfied with Sardar Ihtisham. They asserted that they in no way supported Soulet-ed-Dowleh, and that they desired the appointment of Soulet-es-Sultaneh as ilkhani. In negotiating with Sardar Ihtisham, Mohammed Ali Khan insisted strongly on the release of Ayyaz Kiha, and at last the ilkhani weakly consented. This concession was fatal. The Kashgais saw that Mohammed Ali Khan was master of the situation and they began to desert to Soulet-es-Sultaneh. Negotiations continued for some time, and Mohammed Khan, leaving the Government army at Chenar Bahdar, proceeded to Baiza to support the ilkhani. At the request of Mohammed Ah Khan and Soulet-es-Sultaneh, Kawam- ul-Mulk dispatched Mudabber-es-Sultaneh, the deputy governor, to Baiza to assist in effecting a reconciliation. He was accompanied by Musteshir-ul-Mulk, a registered British subject, who had often acted as secretary to former ilkhanis. They did not proceed beyond Guyum, the attitude of Mohammed Ali Khan and Soulet-es-Sultaneh inspiring them with little confidence. As they were returning to Shiraz they were attacked by Hassan Ali Khan, a minor Kashkuli chief. Mudabber-es-Sultaneh alone succeeded in effecting his escape. His sowars were disarmed, and Musteshir-ul-Mulk was made prisoner and handed over to Soulet-ed-Dowleh, who, wishing to extract from him a legal transfer of his properties round Firuzabad, long arbitrarily appropriated by Soulet-ed-Dowleh, sent him as a prisoner to a fort near Firuzabad. Sardar Ilitisham had now apparently lost hope. Suddenly, without warning his partisans, he retired from his camp, while his brother, Salar Hishmet, handed over the tribes to Soulet-es-Sultaneh. Sardar Ihtisham arrived at Shiraz on the 29th September. He declared that the conditions which Mohammed Ali Khan and the other kalantars wished to impose on him were such as would have made him their servant. He said that if the Government would give him a moderate force he would, with the help of his suppoiters, march against Mohammed Ali Khan, whose overthrow he considered essential. Failing this he could not remain ilkhani with any profit to the Government or himself. In thus retiring from the tribe, Sardar Ihtisham seems to have displayed regrettable precipitation and weakness. Probably he realised that the days of the ilkhaniship were ovei, and thought it better to retire on the money he had succeeded in collecting than to provoke innumerable blood feuds by a hopeless struggle against the recalcitrant K&amp;i&amp;iich tcirs. i jf r f P 1 fy ed ^ Soulet-ed-Dowleh in the Baiza developments is obscure. He undoubtedly had some sort of an understanding with Soulet-es-Sultaneh, but it seems evident that Mohammed Ah Khan, Haji Mohammed Kerim Khan, and some other ashgtu chiefs i-eally cherished hopes of establishing Soulet-es-Sultaneh as a puppet lain. iieso opes were inevitably disappointed through the incapacity of Soulet- e . s j. bu ‘ t f' neh - A meeting took place between him, Soulet-ed-Dowleh, and'Mohammed Ah Khan near Khan-i-Zimyan, with the result that Soulet-es-Sultaneh agreed to accompany his brother to Jirreh. Mohammed Ali Khan and Mohammed Khan patched np a reconciliation one with another, and both proceeded to Shapoor. Soulet-es- Sultaneh, though placed m charge of the Kashgais by the Persian Government, has een more 01 ess superser ed by Soulet-ed-Dowleh, who appears to be exercising a vaguesuzerainty over the tribes. Ali Penah Kiha and Samsam-es-Sultaneh suffered con siderably, for their possessions were plundered by Ayyaz Kiha. Zeki Khan, the Farsimadani kalantar, has been dismissed by Soulet-es-Sultaneh or Soulet-ed-Dowleh, ^ and has gone to Kamarij with his immediate retainers. Masih Khan, the other Farsiraadani kalantar, and t vvm of the lesser Kashkuli khans, went with Sardar Ihtisham to meet the Governor-General at Persepolis. The lateness of the season was partly responsible for the hurried departure of the disturbing elements from the vicinity of the town. Also, no doubt, Soulet-ed-Dowleh, Soulet-es-Sultaneh, and Mohammed Ali Khan were anxious not to remain in the vicinity of the town on the arrival of Mukhber-es-Sultaneh. A refusal on their part, when they were so close to Shiraz, to come into town and pay their respects to the Governor- General would have savoured too strongly of revolt. The news of Sardar Ihtisham’s retirement and lack of funds caused the break-up of the Government army at Chenar Rahdar. The famous expeditionary force, after absorbing the greater part of 20,000 tomans, melted away without having done anything effective. The state of the Shiraz valley, after Hassan Khan’s advance to Siakh at the end of July, grew more and more unsatisfactory. The tribal riflemen, Kashgai and Khamseh, summoned to form the expeditionary army, were more baneful to the Shiraz valley than the marauders they had come to repel. They robbed freely in and around the city, and their chiefs seemed to have little control over them. Kawam-ul-Mulk’s restraining influence grew weaker and weaker. There were several daring assaults on Europeans, for whom the tribesmen had evidently lost their respect. But for the personally friendly dispositions of the tribal chiefs in the town towards the consulate, we might not have got through the tribal migration without more serious incidents. As it was, from the beginning of September, I had to warn the British subjects not to remain abroad after sunset. The raids of Hassan Khan’s men from Siakh resulted in the interruption of the snow supply of the town at the very hottest period of the year, and rendered it dangerous for Europeans or townsmen to circulate at any distance from the city. This state of affairs continued until the tribes had passed Shiraz. As the Kashgais moved southward, the Sarhad route, which had been safe all the summer, was naturally closed. Several large caravans came down in the wake of the Governor-General, and the squadron of the Central India Horse withdrawn from Isphan to Shiraz. Otherwise caravan traffic with Isphan has been practically suspended since the middle of September. Since the end of July blocks on the Bush ire road have been even more frequent than before, partly owing to the closing of the Chenar Radhar-Khan-i-Ziniyan stage after the occupation of Siakh by Hassan Khan, partly owing to chronic hostilities lower down the road, between Ali Mohammed Kamariji, one of the ringleaders of the attacks on our troops, who is still in possession of Rahdar, and the Kazeroonis, helped by their allies of Kamarij, as well as between the Kamarajis, supported by Shabancara, and the adherents of Nur Mohammed Khan of Daliki, under the command of his brother, Hussein Bey, who is in possession of Konartakhteh. Hussein Bey, profiting by the death of Khurshid Khan, reported in my telegram No. Ill of the 16th July last, seized Cherum, a village belonging to Kamarij and lying on the road between Kamarij and Konartakhteh. The 70,000 cartridges consigned to the Ears Government and seized by Hussein Bey (see my telegram No. 141 of the 23rd August last) must have been very useful during the hostilities around Cherum. However, the Kamarijis succeeded in reoccupying Cherum, and peace has, at any rate temporarily, been made between the two contending parties. The extortionate exactions of headmen and roadguards from caravans have shown no signs of diminution, and the rates of transport are as exorbitant as ever. After the retirement of Sardar Ihtisham the road remained practically closed for several weeks, no one being responsible for its protection. The districts, on the importance of which for Shiraz trade I laid stress in my despatch No. 10 of the 15th July last, have remained closed. South-Eastern Ears, the most important outlet for merchandise imported to Shiraz, is, owing to the interruption of communications with Shiraz, being now largely supplied from Bunder Abbas. As a result of this state of affairs the present year has been the worst on record for Shiraz merchants, who have been unable to clear the goods brought up from Bush ire at phenomenal rates of transport. The director of the Indo-European telegraph department has m) doubt kept you informed of the frequent interruptions to the telegraph wires. These interruptions and the assaults on, and robberies of, repairing parties have been far more frequent than in [2763 w—l5j C6 previous years, though the usual autumnal total interruption of the southern wires was less prolonged than in the last two years. _ • i 11 j The events of the last six months have resulted in a consideiable deterioration of^ the situation generally in Ears. The waning authority of the Government has beenG almost entirely broken up. Even more serious has been the dissolution of tribal b authority. The control of the chiefs over their tribesmen has become largely ineffectual as a restraining influence. The Khamseh tribesmen, with possibly the exception of a part of the Shaybani Arabs under Asker and Mohammed Kuly Khan, are completely out of the control of their kalantars. The Kashgais, always more submissive than the Khamseh, still respond to a limited extent to the restrictions of their kalantars, but are tending to become more and more insubordinate. The kalantars have created for themselves a position of independence against which no ilkhani, under present conditions, can successfully assert himself _ ^ The main cause of the successful insubordination of the Khamseh and Kashgai tribes has, of course, been the rivalry between the Kawami family and boulet-ed- Dowleh. This rivalry has enabled the kalantars of the Kamseh and Kashgai tribes to make themselves practically independent of the Kawam-ul-Mulk and the ilkhani respectively; it has indirectly led to the insubordinate attitude of the tribesmen towards the kalantars themselves. To enable the kalantars to regain control over their tribesmen, or to enable Kaw T am-ul-Mulk and an ilkhani to reassert their authority over the Khamseh and Kashgai tribes, a settlement of the strife between the Kawami family and Soulet-ed-Dowleh would seem essential. In 1910, when the Government still had considerable authority left, a soluticn would not have been difficult. Now the Government’s authority is well-nigh gone and cannot count as an important factor in the resolution of this vital problem of Ears. Sardar Ihtisham, by force of circumstances and by his own incapacity, has failed to impose his authority on the Kashkais. It is improbable that Soulet-ed-Dowleh can be more successful as long as he has to contend against the Kav/ami influence among the Kashgai and Khamseh tribes. It is equally improbable that Kawam-ul-Mulk can ever impose bis authority on the Khamseh tribes as long as he is distracted by the opposition of Soulet-ed-Dowleh. The Government is at present too weak to annihilate either the Kawami power or Soulet-ed-Dowleh. Unless, therefore, a reconciliation and an alliance can be brought about between these two rival powers, the affairs of Ears are likely to remain in a hopeless impasse. Such an alliance, with Government support, might possibly lead to a gradual reduction of the insubordinate Khamseh and Kashgai tribes. Efforts are being made to effect such a reconciliation, which some persons believe, for several reasons, to be easier to-day than at any previous time. Firstly, they reason, Soulet-ed-Dowleh has been humbled and must have realised its limitations. Secondly, it is said that the Bakhtiaris are now animated with less hostile sentiments towards Soulet-ed-Dowleh. A minor Bakhtiari khan, Abbas Kuli Khan, came to Shiraz in September with a view to negotiating a marriage between Murteza Kuli Khan, son of Samsam-es-Sultaneh, and a sister of Soulet-ed-Dowleh. In 1910 this same Murteza Kuli Khan married Sardar Ihtisham’s sister, who died last year. In the present case, the negotiations, which were conducted with Soulet-es-Sultaneh, may possibly have been intended to detach that chief from Soulet-ed-Dowleh. Anyhow, they do not appear to have led to any definite understanding. Thirdly, it is argued that the sudden death, on the 21st instant, of Lika-ed-Dowleh, the wife of Kawam-ul-Mulk, is likely to facilitate a reconciliation. This woman, a Kashgai and aunt of Soulet-ed-Dowleh, was a remarkable personality, possessing a great influence over her hasband and many powerful elements in the province. Her death provoked quite an extraordinary demonstration in Shiraz, all the bazaars closing for one day in sign of mourning. Of mutable connections in her sexual life, she was yet devoted to her husband’s interests. She acted as his bailiff and political adviser, and even fought for him. In the summer of 1911, with her brother-in-law murdered and her husband in refuge at the consulate, she succeeded in bringing the Khamseh tribesmen into town, and by the energy of her direction caused the defeat of Nizam-es-Sultaneh and Soulet-ed-Dowdeh. She is said, during the hostilites in the town, to have gone to the barricades and used a rifle as competently as any of the fighting men. Her restless, uncompromising spirit often stiffened her husband, and it is thought that the removal of her influence may facilitate negotiations for peace. It is even suggested that, Lika-ed-Dowleh being dead, it might be possible to arrange a marriage between Kawain-ul-Mulk and Soulet-ed-Dowleh s sister. ^ Fourthly, it is hoped that the lassitude resulting from long, ineffectual strife may dispose both parties to peace.I am inclined to think that those who hope for this happy consummation overlook the most important factor m this problem. Everything is quickly forgotten in Persia and it is possible that Kawam-ul-Mulk may overlook the years of bitter rivalry the jreacherous murder of his bi other, his own narrow escape from a similar fate but the material loss he has suffered, and is suffering, from Soulet-ed-Dowleh’s rapacity is a far more serious matter. Machiavelli’s remark that “ men forget more quickly the death of their father than the loss of their patrimony ” is true at any rate as regards Persia Unless some means can be devised to deter Soulet-ed-Dowleh from plundering and appropriating the properties of Kawam-ul-Mulk and other Ears landowners I fail to see how any real reconciliation can be effected. And Soulet-ed-Dowleh is peculiarly shortsighted when his avarice comes into play. Time after time he has sacrificed his political interests to his insatiate greed. Moreover, I confess that I am sceptical as to whether Soulet-ed-Dowleh’s misfortunes will have taught him wisdom. He is peculiarly untrustworthy, even for a Persian, and he has little political* sagacity. I doubt whether the Government could ever be assured of his co-operation, even if his legitimate interests were protected. The Persian Government cannot now, in my opinion, count on a restoration of order through the reconciliation of Kawam-ul-Mulk with Soulet-ed-Dowleh. Even if such a reconciliation were effected, the Government would still require a strong, efficient regular force to support these two magnates in reducing their insubordinate tribesmen. If a reconciliation is found impracticable, the Government may be compelled in the end to make an attempt to remove Kawam-ul-Mulk from Ears, to abolish the ilkhaniship of the Kashgai tribes and to deal direct with the kalantars. In that eventuality a larger force would be required. However, with or without the assistance of a combination of the most powerful tribal leaders in Ears, the Persian Government cannot to-day hope for a restoration of order without the support of a regular army of considerable strength. The_ old policy of using tribe against tribe is played out. The tribes have at last realised the folly, in their own interests, of fightingeach other “ pour le ftoi de Prusse.’ In conclusion, I would lay stress on one special question, which, nevertheless, is of the most general import for the administration of Ears. I refer to the prosecution of the ringleaders of the attacks on our troops. This question, as has already been noted, had a disastrous influence on the situation this summer. It is likely to play a prominent part in future developments. This question concerns us very particularly, but it is of even more concern to the Persian Government in its bearing on the internal administra tion of the province. No governor can hope to impose his authority satisfactorily on the province, no ilkhani can hope to re-establish his authority over the Kashgais, until the tribe which attacked in pitched battle the regular troops of the Power hitherto most feared in Ears has been called to account.

[282—480]From Viceroy, 28th March 1913. (Repeated to Bushire.) Foreign Secret. Shiraz. Your telegram of 26th March. Cox who was consulted on 0 Connor s proposal telegraphs as follows : “I was somewhat surprised that Governor-General, to whom presence of our troops must be a source of comfort, did not demur to their withdrawal. From my point of view, it was always contemplated in correspondence of September 1911 that they might be required for two years or longer, and general situation prevailing at moment is by no means so hopeful or clear that one (? can) contemplate their withdrawal at this juncture without some misgivings. But it has been stienuously pressed on regimental and military grounds, and has also been accepted in principle by His Majesty’s Govern ment and Government of India, as a factor in their policy, and at such incidental risk and loss of credit as it may involve. It seems therefore only logical that we should eschew half measures, and, if possible, withdraw ail extra men from inland and revert to normal arrangements. O’Connor evidently considers his personal escort is sufficient, and that safety of Consulate will not be seriously endangered by withdawal of infantry as well as Central India Horse, and in this connection I agree that there is no special feature m state of b ars politics at the moment such as to suggest anv deliberate attack on Consulate is likely. Moreover, in my opinion, party of 100 men proceeding to Shiraz at present would incur great risk of attack; much more than Central India Horse will incur in coming down.” We do not consider there are same political objections to retention of infantry detachment as there are in case of Central India Horse. Detachment was sent up in 1911 with object of affording additional protection for Consulate, and until the gendarmerie are organised into an effective force we consider it undesirable to withdraw such protection. In the case of a riot or other local disturbance, Consular escort of 10 Sowars would be insufficient to allay anxiety with regard to safety of European community and Consulate, while detachment of 60 men might well hold their own until the local authorities had succeeded in restoring order. Further we think it is undesirable to forego evidence of our special status in neutral zone which presence of this guard at Shiraz affords. It is no particular hardship for infantry guard to remain. If the situation does not improve, their presence may be very useful, while if it improves in the course of next few months there should be no difficulty in relieving them.r % ■ is M J ^ 13485- I,9ei - 10,000.—7/1912. /O^) Departments vre requested, if they suspect that there is any mistake in this telegram, to communicate ' 4 imn^atel^ with the Private SecretaryParliamentary Under Secretary of State. ^ ' COPY OF TELEGRAM.

Following from His Majesty’s representative at Shiraz, No. 92 of 19th March : “ With regard to withdrawal of infantry escort from Shiraz. I am of opinion that the whole of the infantry detachment may now be withdrawn, and that it is not necessary to replace them. This will leave the consulate with escort of twelve sowars. “ The latter escort, however, is now short of two men invalided to India leaving me with only ten. ’ 8 “ I propose, therefore, that for the future the number of sowars for this consular escort should be fixed at ten, and that in the place of the two men I should be permitted to engage jour Persian gholams at 10 tomans per month each. The average monthly cost of Indian sowar, including his clothing, and including journey to and from India, works out at about 77 rupees.

I HAX E the honour to forward to you herewith copy of a despatch which the officer commanding His^ Majesty’s troops at Shiraz has addressed to the. chief of the stah m India on the sueject oi the attack on a party of the regiment near Khan-i-Zinian on the 11th December, which resulted in the death'of Captain Eckford. I would beg leave to offer the following^ observations on paragraph 3 of Colonel Douglas s covering despatch, which is, I fear, likely to convey a mistaken impression Mr. Smart, recently His Majesty’s acting consul at Shiraz, informs me that, to the best of his knowledge, the officers or men of the Central India Horse were only once maliciously fired on, the occasion in question being the attack on Lieutenant Frazer and his orderly mentioned in this same paragraph. The other occasions were not malicious attacks; they were generally cases of villagers, tribesmen, or riflemen, firing either under a misapprehension that our men had hostile intentions or from pure light heartedness, without intention to kill. These can hardly be termed “ outrages,” and the observation that no satisfaction has been obtained for any of these occurrences is somewhat misleading. In one case, the Kawam-ul-Mulk caused the headman of the village responsible to be brought into Shiraz, and sent him to His Majesty’s consulate to apologise. As the matter was obviously a misunderstanding, Colonel Douglas accepted this settlement as sufficient reparation. The other incidents are normal incidents, continually occurring in the neighbourhood of Shiraz. The natives generally, villagers or tribesmen, are in a state of continual apprehension, and the appearance of armed men always causes alarm. Those alarmed generally fire a few shots over the heads of the party approaching, to show that they are prepared. Civilians riding with Persian sowars are also liable to such incidents, though the danger is less in such instances, because Persians, by recognised calls, signs, raising of hats or rifles, know how to calm the alarm of the excited villagers. On one occasion, some officers, with half a squadron, were out exercising 3 miles south-west of Shiraz. The Shishbuluki Kashgais, who were passing southward, were encamped in a lo-w line of hillocks at the spot in question. They fired at our men, whom their officers restrained from returning the fire ; the next day the officers returned with a large force to demand explanations. The Shishbulukis explained that they always fired, on principle, at any body of armed men seen approaching, and that our men should have raised their hats or their rifles, to show that they were friends. The conversation ended in the most amicable manner. On another occasion, two officers were out shooting, with two orderlies, some 3 miles to the south of the town. Some local riflemen, posted on a hillock, amused themselves by firing shots wide of our officers, whom, as it was dusk, the riflemen may not have recognised. The officers went back in force on the morrow, seized a rifleman, and brought him into the town. The Governor-General promised to have him beaten in the presence of a representative of the consulate. As Mr. Smart was leaving Shiraz for Tehran that day, I am unable to say whether the punishment was inflicted, but there is no reason to suppose that his Excellency did not keep his promise. I have, &amp;c.

'dyri I HAVE the honour to forward a detailed report by Major A. M. Kettlew ell of the attack on a party of the regiment of which he was in charge, and which resulted in tie death of Captain A. B. Eckford and the loss of nine mules and their loads. [2804 /c—20] ® Oft1. Mai or Kettlewell and Captain Eckford had obtained permission from me to go to Dasht-i-Arjan, partly with the object of shooting and partly to carry out some survey work in that neighbourhood under the superintendence of the latter olhcer, who was himself a trained surveyor. The larger portion of the regiment have now been m Shiraz for more than a year, and owing to the disturbed state of the countiy and my desire to assist the political authorities by avoiding incidents which must necessarily prove embarrassing to them, the movements of officers and men have until quite recently been strictly confined to within a few miles of the city. 2 In the middle of October a new Governor-General of the province reached here from Tehran, and his arrival was immediately followed by a great improvement in the security of the neighbourhood. r I he tribesmen hau mostly moved dow n co their winter quarters m the plains, and the more lawless elements were, tempoiarily at least, quiet. The particular portion of the road on which the party w ere moving had, moi eo/ei, been taken over bv the gendarmes more than a montn ago , since then Swedish officers, accompanied only by a small escort, had been moving freely cser it, and travellers and caravans had been unmolested. . . Under these circumstances, I thought I was justified nyallowing officers somewhat greater latitude in their movements, and consequently sanctioned the expedition which ended so disastrously for the regiment, subject only to the approval of His Majesty s consul and the Governor-General of the province. .3. Since the arrival of the regiment in Persia, little more than a year ago, officers and men have been fired at on twelve different occasions, and six of these incidents have occurred within 5 miles of Shiraz itself. It is, therefore, purely a matter of chance that there have been no casualties among officers before. In August last Lieutenant W. Fraser, while returning home after dark, accompanied by a single orderly, was attacked by five armed men w 7 it bin a few hundred yards of the consulate, and escaped only by galloping at and through his assailants ; his orderly had a button shot off his coat, the bullet afterwards passing through his sleeve. For none of these outrages has any satisfaction been obtained. 4. I cannot sufficiently express my regret that my action in sanctioning this expe dition has resulted in Captain Eckford’s death. He was a most able and valuable officer, who had justly earned the respect and admiration of all ranks. I look upon his death as a serious loss, not only to the regiment, but to the whole Indian army. I am forwarding a copy of this despatch, with enclosure, to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran.

This they did. ^ J Until near the river I was accompanied by the Persian officer of gendarmerie with vro sowars from Khan-i-Zinian. These then galloped on a-head to visit their post at the tower on the crest of the Sineh Safid Pass. Almost immediately after the gendarmes had left me I sent Jemadar Soraiyan bmgh and two sowars with orders to trot on to Dasht-i-Arjan, in order to arrive there before the sarbazes and secure accommodation for my men, about which I knew there would be some difficulty. onn I then crossed the river, sending two scouts on to a small isolated hill (about oOO ieet high), about 700 yards south-west of the bridge. I then halted on the far bank for ten to fifteen minutes to close up my party before en ermg the strip of thorn and tamarisk jungle, through which the road passes for about miles. ^ &amp; r 9nn J sta Hed on again at about 8 a.m. sending a scout to ride along the ridge (about , • above the road), which rises some 400 yards beyond the isolated hill mentioned a o\e. I sent forward two scouts to get up on to the next hill beyond this ridge, and wo scouts to ride a-head on the road. The two scouts who had been on the first hill fon rejoined me, and my advanced party then consisted of Captain Eckford, myself, our our orderlies, and five men of B squadron. At 8*20 A.M. this advanced party had go about 200 yards clear of the strip of jungle, and the leading baggage mules were just appearing out of it when a hot fire was opened on us from the hills, 300 yards to advanced party galloped to get under the shelter of a hill about Tk’ .^ 0 i ron t, and ithe four leading mules and four followers joined it here, is hill is of convex section, so that on reaching it we were under cover. All the is near are thickly covered with scrub jungle, so that so far we had seen nothing of our a ackers. On reaching the foot of this hill we dismounted, and leaving two men with our horses began to climb the hill, which was frozen hard and very slippery. We had c imbed about 40 yards up the hill, and I personally could still see nothing of the enemy hut some of the men must have done so, as they had fired a few shots in return 0 are which was falling all round us. At this moment Captain Eckford was in the act of taking aim with his revolver^ eo he suddenly gave a lurch and fell. He was a yard away from me on my left. [2804 k—20] B 2*- I went to him and he gasped out “ they have hit me/ and after that became quite unconscious. I left two men with him, and his servant who was clown oeiow came up to him. . I then with three remaining men moved a little higher up, and towards the east ed^re of the spur on which we then were. I could then (across a wooded ravine, which' ran up into hills see some of the enemy on the hill on the opposite side ( this was the end of the ridge along which I had sent my scout), and as I reached the edge I saw from 150 to 200 of the enemy rush out from the bottom of the ravine and cross about 30 yards of open ground and disappear into the jungle beyond. The hrsfc fifty or so of these men had rifles, the remaining appeared to be unarmed. I and the men with me fired at them, but I could not see whether any of them were hit. Up to this time I had no knowledge of what had happened to the men of A squadron and the rest of the baggage mules. Put had seen several of the followers run off into the jungle directly the first shots were fired. From where I now was I could see some of the mules emerging from the jungle into the open bed of the river. They were quickly surrounded by Persians and taken out of my sight. I could also see one or two of the men of A squadron who had got on the low hills north of the river. Shots were still being tired at us from the top of the hills on our side. My object now was to try and collect the whole o: my men and to remove Captain Eckford. I went back to him and found that he was quite unconscious, but he seemed to still he breathing. I had him carried down the bill and put on a horse in front of one of the men, and then leaving three men to cover my retirement, with orders to rejoin me at a gallop as soon as I was about 400 yards clear, I proceeded with the mules and folio were as fast as I could to the right (north) bank of the river. On the way I was joined by Jemadar Soraiyan Singh and the two men who had gone on with him. He reported to me that he had overtaken the Persian sarbazes about half way up to the tower on the top of the Sineh-Safid Pass (some 2 miles ahead) ; he had then heard the firing. He asked the Persian officer of the sarhazes to return, which he refused to do, and he himself' then came back at a gallop along the bed of the river. As I approached the light bank of the river one of the men of A squadron galloped up to me and reported that his party with some followers and mules was on a hill just ahead. I joined them and found that one syce and several mules were missing: sowar Poor an Singh (the scout I had sent on to the ridge when I left the river after halting) was also reported to be missing, but was shortly afterwards reported to be present. Having collected my party I placed the followers, left horee and mule in charge of Jemadar Soraiyan Singh, with orders to keep well under the left bank of the river ind level with me ; here they were absolutely under cover from the north, and had a certain amount of concealment from view on the south, afforded by a line of tamarisk bushes in the bed of the river. t he country to the north consists of low-rolling hills for several miles, with a few bushes here and there on them, but the watercourses which run into the river are fairly thickly covered with scrub. I moved along these hills with my men in two sections, sending these sections forward alternately, and thus reached the road just beyond the bridge at 11*20 a. if. On the way I saw about fifteen to twenty mounted men on a ridge about 1,500 yards to the north and several men on foot in the ravines nearer to me with whom I exchanged shots, and saw at least one of them hit. I also saw fifiv or sixtv men with rules on the : ridge, but could not ascertain who thev were. Thev eventually disappeared. Desultory shots were being fired most of the time from the hills south of the river, and I saw three horsemen moving along the hills from the direction of the Sineh-Safid Pass. These after a time I recognised to be Persian gendarmes. On nearing the bridge I saw thirty- or forty men, some of them with rifles, on a small hill 400 vards in front of me, and was preparing to fire on them when thev disappeared. Shortly afterwards about i wen. v men appeared without arms, and I went up to them. Thev were men from Khan-i Zinian, and the telegraph ghulam was with them. Directlv after my horses nad crossea the bridge 1 was joined bv the Persian officer of gendarmerie. He told me gnat he had had three or four men wounded, and asked me for help to bring them in, but tooit some of the villagers and riflemen from the village to do t jis. He then went off. and I did not see him again, till about 5 r.M. I now mounted my men ana moved, with scouts out on the hills to the north, back to the caravanserai at Khan i-Zinian.^ iitdi a ' &gt;U'.

Fifteen to twenty horsemen also came up from behind. I then, with what mules I could get hold of, took my men across the river. As I was moving across about thirty to forty horsemen came out from the opposite bank. I got my men on to a small hill on the other side of the river and opened fire on the enemy, some of whom tried to make an attack on me with the object of carrying off the mules I had with me, but they were driven hack by my fire. They then went off up a ravine towards the north, and were quickly followed by the others who had first seized the mules. I saw them carry off four men who had been hit. They carried off about fourteen mules altogether, i.e., about five moie than they had got from me. I saw no other mules anywhere in the neiodi- bourhood.

(Repeated Bushire No. 38.) I have the honour to invite reference to my telegram No. 42 and to state that I have been in communication with the Governor-General and with Monsieur Stas with regard to measures which it will be practicable to adopt during the coming spring to restrain the depredations of the tribesmen. We propose that 300 sowars should now be engaged, in addition to the 200 already provided for in the budget; this will make a total of 500, which it is considered should be permanent strength of the cavalry of the province. It is estimated by the Agent of the Treasurer-General that the pay of these extra 300 men can be met out of the savings which are being’effected out of the £15,000 on the present budget estimates. The above is the only practical measure which the local authorities can guarantee to undertake out of their own re sources to restrain the tribesmen. It is clearly not sufficient to enable the Governor-General to protect the distant outlying properties. If after consult ing the Governor-General the Central Government consider that further mea sures are necessary for this purpose, they will have to provide additional funds. Stas again begs me to impress on you the urgency of the following measures :— (1) Engagement of European officers for supervision of troops and mili' tary arrangements generally. (2) Arms and ammunition to be provided for the Governor-General’s new force. . (3) Mischievous persons who are instigating all sorts of intrigues to be removed from the town. He instances the recent invasion of his office by a crowd of clamorous pension- holders—an act which he ascribes largely to the instigation of the Kawam’s followers. (4) Essential question of provision of funds for the ensuing year. I am very sorry to appear to press these points unduly, but Nau Buz is draw ing near,* and both Stas and I are anxious to lose no chance of putting the pro vince in a proper state, and we hope that it will not turn out that the money now being expended has been merely wasted. -r' ■CONFIDENTIAL. * Sir Edward Grey to Sir W.

Telegram P., No. 25, dated (and received) the 2nd February 1913. From—His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—His Majesty's Consul, Shiraz. (Repeated to Bushire No. 52.) Your telegram No. 39, with reference to the question of withdrawing the Central India Horse from Shiraz, has been under my most careful consideration, and I have asked Sir P. Z. Cox to favour me with his views on the subject. Whilst we both fully appreciate the unsatisfactoriness of the situation from the point of view of the regiment, and whilst we both sympathize most heart ily with them we are both agreed that neither the time nor the manner of the proposed withdrawal are suitable. It does not seem to me seemly or in keeping with the dignity of a British regiment to proceed down the road under the escort of Swedish gendarmerie, whilst I do not think it would be possible to disabuse tribesmen of the belief that a movement to punish Muhammad Ali Khan was ■,r ■’i- Ja&gt;. 15^1^1'on foot, were a British force, as suggested, to march out from Bushire to meet the regiment, and accompany it over the difficult passes in the lower section of the road. There would seem to be a grave danger of the regiment being attacked at a disadvantage before a junction had been effected by ^ the two parties. The political situation, moreover, is by no means settled; it may well be that the gendarmerie will prove a failure and His Majesty’s Government find themselves in the autumn compelled to abandon their present pacific policy. Unless a large loan is floated, the new Cabinet, though it is a strong one, will find it impossible to carry on the administration. It is impossible for these reasons to foresee what the future may have in store for Persia and I consider it undesirable under the circumstances that the risks attendant on withdrawal should be run by the regiment. I further con sider that the position of the Governor-General would suffer as the result of the withdrawal of the regiment, and I have reason to believe that it acts as a deterrent to certain antagonistic elements in Shiraz. Please discuss the above with Colonel Douglas and express my most sincere regrets to him and to the regiment that I am unable to advocate their with drawal this spring. Should any arguments, which appear to you and Colonel Douglas more weighty than my reasons against it, occur to your minds I am quite ready to entertain them and, if you wish, submit them to His Majesty’s Government. As I felt unable to recommend it, I have not yet referred the proposal to Sir E. Grey. Enclosure No. 2. Telegram P., No. 42, dated the 3rd February 1913. From—His Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, To—His Majesty's Minister, Tehran. (Repeated to the Political Resident, Bushire, No. 30.) I was visited by the Kawam last week, who pointed out that the Governor- General’s new force was making but slow progress, and that as in any case they had no arms, they would be of no use for some months to come, and that the Governor-General had no other efficient troops at his disposal. In the meanwhile, he said, the spring season was drawing near, a critical time, when the tribes would again be on the move, and there might be antici pated to be a recurrence of raids and robberies. He pointed out how essential it was that at least one section of each tribe should be made an example of, the Baharlus being selected for the purpose from among the Khamseh, and the Kashkulis from among the Qashqais. Failing action in this direction, he anticipated a recrudescence of disorders. I asked him how he proposed to effect the chastisement suggested. He replied that if he were allowed enough money (30,000 tomans was the figure he suggested) and 100,000 cartridges, he would undertake to raise a force and in flict punishment himself on the Baharlus. I replied evasively, and discussed ' matter later with the Governor-General. I have already mentioned that the Governor-General is quite alive to the anomalies presented by the Kawam’s position here. He is well aware that in many ways the latter enjoys a pres tige and influence that are, even now, greater than that of the Governor- General, and that this state of things must continue until a suitable force is at the Governor-General’s disposal. He realizes, I think, that there is no longer any room in Ears for the ; Kawam and the Governor-General. I myself am very strongly of this opinion, and beg reference to my diary for the week ending December 28th for the considerations which I have sub mitted in support of this view. I have had constant evidence since writing those remarks of the impossible state of things which must endure so long as the Kawam remains in Ears. With or without the latter’s knowledge, every intriguer and malcontent in the province bases his schemes to some extent on the Kawam, and relies on3 his aid should he get into trouble with the local powers that h„ ti, , , proposal made to me by the Kawam simolv temlc fV, r.r. a t f be '.

I will keep you informed of the Kawam’s plans and of the ideas of the Governor-General on the subject, so far as I am able to learn them- in the meanwhile, should opportunity occur, you might be able perhaps to ’indicate to the Persian Government how difficult the presence of Kawam makes the Governor-General’s position here, even when the former is well disposed. You yourself, I think, hold similar opinions on the subject, and would concur in mv proposal that the Kawam should leave Pars. J Enclosure No. 3. Telegram P., No. 48, dated the 3rd (received 4 th) February 1913. From—His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. (Repeated to the Political Resident Bushire, as No. 31.) Your telegram No. 25. Poliowing for you from Colonel Do uglas :— I quite appreciate the objections that exist to any appearance of our movements to Bushire being under the aegis of the gendarmerie, but this would largely be obviated if Major O’Connor’s suggestion were adopted, i.e., by our co-operating with them in bringing up arms. Por this purpose it is essential that both from here and from Bushire, the gendarmerie should be accompanied by our troops, in which case I think the combined force would be of sufficient strength to obviate any chance of attack by the Kashkulis. • arran £ emen t is not an ideal one, but it seems to me that unless His Majesty’s Government intend to despatch an expedition to Pars this autumn (m which case no doubt we should do better to stay) no hope exists of any improvement in the situation, nor are we likely to have a more favourable opportunity of withdrawing. I cannot look on the prospect of indefinite detention with equanimity, the circumstances of our stay here being of necessity detrimental to the efficiency of the regiment. It is not for me to give an opinion as to what effect would be produced on the local political situation by our withdrawal, but I would point out that the regiment has been treated since January of last year not as an active force, but rather as a source of embarrassment, which it was desirable to remove on the first opportunity. I can therefore hardly think that anything hut a * harmful effect can be produced on our good name here by its retention. Ends. /Enclosure No. 4. Telegram P., No. 56, dated (and received) the 5th February 1913. From—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, x To—The Political Resident, Bushire. Following sent to Foreign Office No. 53, repeated to Bushire and Shiraz : Begins. Major O’Connor telegraphs that it has been pointed out to him by the Qawam that, seeing that the Governor-General appears to find some difficulty in enrolling recruits for his new force, the task of punishing at all events the Baharlus should he entrusted to the Qawam, as there will be very serious trouble in the spring unless this tribe or the Kashkulis are punished m an exemp ary manner. The Qawam naturally added that for this purpose he would require about 30,000 tomans and 100,000 cartridges to give effect to his punitive measures. An evasive reply was returned by Major O’Connor, who subsequently talked the matter over with Mukhhir-es-Sultaneh. It would in mv opinion he most unwise to entrust the Qawam with money, and to allow him 'to collect a force such as he suggests would make the tact that he is a stronger factor than the Governor-General apparent to ail. It is probably true, as it is, hut to emphasize the fact would inevitably lead to grave disorders. It is further reported by His Majesty’s Consul that the Qawam is intrigu ing, and that he and the Governor-General concur in thinking that it is desirable that the Qawam should leave Fars, though the Governor-General hesitates to declare himself clearly. This view is shared by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who has promised to try to obtain a governorship for him. If this cannot he arranged, I am of opinion that it is most desirable that Qawam should go abroad for a time. This he could probably he persuaded to do under the advice of British Consul, hut it would he necessary to take care not to convey the impression that he was being forced to do so. I fear the situation in Fars is not satisfactory, and that there is reason to fear that trouble will arise in the spring. On 1st March the Swedish Colonel will leave Tehran with 450 men, upon whom he tells me he can rely. Fears having been expressed lest the Salar-ud-Dowleh should go to Meshed, my Russian colleague instructed the Russian Consul-General at that place not to' permit him to enter any line occupied by Russian troops. Were it possible to issue similar instructions authorizing action in this direction by British troops, in the event of possible attack on the town of Shiraz, the Governor-General’s hands would, I think, be greatly strengthened and the prestige of the regiment might be increased. Of course such action would only be taken in concert with the Mukhbir-es-Sultaneh. Ends. Enclosure No. 5. Telegram P., No. 44, dated the 4th (received 5th) February 1913. From—His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. (Repeated Bushire No. 32.) Your telegram 25. Broposed withdrawal of the Central India Horse. As a preliminary to any discussion regarding the withdrawal from Shiraz, I think it must be recognized that a choice of evils confronts us. In existing circumstances the presence at Shiraz of a cavalry regiment here of necessity places His Majesty’s Government in an awkward position, and the policies of l xetention and of withdrawal alike present difficulties. It seems to me therefore S that what we must seek is not an ideal solution, but one wffiich is the least objectionable.Bearing the above consideration in mind, I will endeavour to answer the objections to my proposals which are made by Your Excellency and by Sir Firstly.—Yon .consider that it is not seemly for a regiment to travel under escort of gendarmerie to Bushire. This argument has, it seems to me, been disposed of by Colonel Douglass observations my telegram 431 The movement should, in fact, be looked on as a joint operation? in which the gendarmene are being supported by the cavalry in bringing up their arms and ammunition, ‘whilst the gendarmerie act as escort to cavalry on the march through mountainous country ; from a military point of view it can never be looked on as derogatory to the regiment that they should accept, for a march through mountainous country, such as between here and Bushire, the services of an infantry escort. It is an elementary truism that cavalry, when encumbered with ba»ga»e tram, are quite incapable of protecting themselves efficiently against attack on mountain tracks and among defiles and narrow paths. Under such circumstances, cavalry are practically helpless and their passage can be obstructed by a comparatively small body of hill men, and heavy losses can be occasioned them with practical impunity. The above are simple facts with which every soldier is familiar, and I only refer to them here to show that it is not possible to consider as undignified the mere fact of the regiment being escorted by infantry. t It would undoubtedly he preferable that the escort should consist wholly of British infantry, but this again is an ideal, which is not at present achievable. Secondly .—As regards your objection that the advance from Bushire of troops would tend to provoke attack, I concur with Officer Commanding Troops here in considering that the strength of the combined force would serve rather to deter than to provoke the Kashkulis. My telegram No. 30 deals with this point. Either force should I think be strong enough to look after itself before they joined up. Whatever arrangements are made, however, some risk is inevit able, and I think that the despatch from Bushire of troops would tend to mini mize rather than increase the risk. Thirdly .—You argue that His Majesty’s Government may eventually he compelled by the unsettled state of Southern Persia to intervene. This is recog nized both by Colonel Douglas and myself, and we have both adumbrated such a possibility, in telegrams to your address. If His Majesty’s Government con sider that they may be compelled by disorder in Southern Persia to interv ene in the coming autumn, it would perhaps be preferred to let the regiment stay where it is. If, however, there is any uncertainty about it, they would, I imagine, express preference for a withdrawal as soon as possible, in order to extricate both the Central India Horse and themselves from an embarrassing situation. Fourthly —It is argued by Your Excellency that the Governor-General might be embarrassed by the withdrawal of the regiment. This is not a view with which I am in agreement, but even supposing it to he the case, I scarcely think that it could he seriously advanced as an argument against the withdrawal of the regiment at any moment convenient to ourselves. It was not in order to support the authority of the Governor-General that the regiment was sent to Persia and I scarcely think that its retention at Shiraz for that purpose would he agreed to either by His Majesty’s Government or the Government of India. If it is considered that the Administration of this province can best he supported by British officers and troops, there are many better ways of utilizing their services than by keeping a regiment of Indian Cavalry cooped up in gardens round the town debarred from action, or from the exercise of their military functions. In short, the arguments in favour of keeping the regiment here present themselves to me somewhat in the following light:— In spite of expense and inconvenience to all concerned, and in spite of the admitted fact that under present conditions the regiment is virtually useless, and that numerous enbarrassments ha\e been caused in the past as well as some tragic incidents, and will prob ably be caused in the future ; it is, notwithstanding all this, belterto keep it here if there is the chance that failure of the administra tion of Southern Persia may compel His Majesty’s Government to despatch an expedition to .restore order, rather than to run some risk in arranging for its withdrawal this spring accompanied by a force of gendarmerie. I should like to add that though Your Excellency and Sir P. Z. Cox concur in thinking that the time and manner of withdrawal proposed by me are alike unsuitable, the only counter-proposals made by you are that we should await the possible despatch of a British expedition. Even supposing this expedition to be sent, I am unable to see that there is much likelihood of a more propi tious occasion for withdrawing the regiment presenting itself later on. It is only postponing the inevitable, on the off chance of an expedition,^ and the result of such a postponement might very well be that His Majesty’s Govern ment would be forced in the end to send an expedition, in order to extricate the regiment, a necessity which they would, I presume, desire to avoid. It is desired both by Colonel Douglas and by myself that our views should be represented to His Majesty’s Eoreign Office, but I venture to suggest that the Commandant of the gendarmerie should be sounded beforehand as to whether he would give his consent to the proposed plan, as the whole proposal would have to be reconsidered if he objected. Bushire will please telegraph the above in full to India. Addressed Tehran No. 44, repeated Bushire No. 32. Enclosure No. 6. Telegram P., No. 66-233, dated the 5th February 1913. From—The Political Resident, Bushire, To—His Majesty^s Minister, Tehran. (Repeated Shiraz, No. 66-233.) O’Connor’s telegram No. 44. Correspondence was posted to India in ordinary routine (as you were not for the time communicating with the Eoreign Office in regard to the proposal) and will reach the Government of India on Saturday. I have not yet repeated your telegram No. 52 to India as it arrived after the mail had left. It would seem to meet requirements, and Major O’Connor’s special request, if I waited till Saturday before repeating his telegram No. 41. By that time I shall perhaps be in possession of Your Excellency’s views and can transmit them simultaneously. I had better perhaps mention the following consideration, which naturally does not fall within the purview of the Shiraz Consulate, without, however, proffering comment on the subject of Consul, Shiraz’s present observations. At the present moment we are “up against” Tangistan. To start with, we are blockading the coast against arms traffic, whilst in the second place, punitive action against villages implicated in a grave case of piracy is under consideration, vide my despatch No. 24, which is in the post. In the meanwhile, the Governor, who is also looked on with hostility by the tribes in the hinterland, is without any force of any kind with which to main tain security, and but for the presence of our troops, Bushire itself would un doubtedly have been harassed when the road was blocked just outside, last November. If the 200-odd infantry here were to leave on the mission suggested, Bushire would clearly be left in a weak position, and the opportunity and the excu e to make difficulties for the Governor or to annoy us would thus be afforded to malcontent tribesmen. It might therefore be necessary for me to ask that other troops should be sent to replace those absent. Addressed Minister, repeated Shiraz. Enclosure No. 7.

I have hitherto made no mention of the question of relieving the Consular infantry escort.

The relieved escort would return to Bushire with the cavalry, whilst the relieving detachment would accompany the arms and gendarmerie here. Enclosure No. 8.

I have had the above telegrams under my careful consideration and have come to the conclusion, after going into all the arguments in favour and against the withdrawal of the regiment at the present moment from Shiraz, that the question is one in which political considerations are so far outweighed f by military ones, that I think the best course would be for Colonel Douglas to submit the proposal for the opinion of the military authorities of the Govern ment of India. Should they regard the arguments quoted as justifying the withdrawal of the regiment, no doubt the Government of India will enquire the views of His Majesty’s Government, who in their turn will ask my opinion in the matter. From Bushire telegram No. 233 it would appear that all the correspond ence has been submitted to the Government of India. &lt; No objection is seen to the proposal by Colonel Hjalmarson, but before giving me a definite reply, he is asking Major Siefvert confidentially. He tells me that he feels quite certain that either on the way down to, ; or coming up from, Bushire he will have to fight. Enclosure No. 9. Telegram P., No. 49, dated (and received) the 6 th February 1913. From—His Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, To—His Majesty's Minister, Tehran. (Repeated Bushire, No. 34.) Following is from Colonel Douglas :— Begins. —Your telegram No. 32 has been shown to me by Major O’Connor. M ith reference to the last paragraph, I would state that if any question of the regiment being actively employed during the summer arises, I would of course not ask for them to be taken away in the spring. There are, however, certain | other aspects of our position here, such as the fact that we cannot replace casualties, more especially among horse flesh, which render an indefinite stay here very difficult, and if I could be given some idea of when in normal cir cumstances I may expect the regiment to be withdrawn or replaced, it would be a great help to me.—Ends. I beg to express my concurrence with the views expressed by Colonel Bouglas. If permission be given, as suggested by Your Excellency to Ilis Majesty’s Foreign Office, to protect citizens in case of necessity, it is possible that the presence here in the spring and summer of the regiment might prove to be of great value. It is chiefly because of their present enforced inactivity that their early Withdrawal is advisable.Enclosure No. 10. Telegram P., No. 51, dated (and received) the 7th February 1913. From—His Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, T 0 His Majesty's Minister, Tehran. (Repeated to Bushire, No. 35.) Sir P. Cox’s telegram No. 66. I venture to surest for the consideration of Your Excellency that no argument in favour of the retention of an Indian Cavalry Regiment at Shiraz is constituted hy difficulties in the Persian Gulf. If as Sir P Cox anticipates, the safety of Bushire would be seriously imperilled by the despatch thence of 200 men on a minor expedition, which should not last more than a fortnight and would interfere with punitive measures in the Gulf, it would seem possible to reinforce Bushire temporarily from Jask, or hy landing a party of Bluejackets. The question is, at any rate, one of detail, which does not materially affect arguments bearing on the desirability or otherwise of withdrawing the Central India Horse. Enclosure No. 11. Telegram P., No. 52, dated (and received) the 7th February 1913. From—His Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, To—His Majesty's Minister, Tehran. (Repeated Bushire, No. 86.) The following telegram has been addressed to Tehran, No. 52, and repeated to Bushire, No. 36. Bushire will please repeat this telegram also to India with the rest of the correspondence. Begins. Please refer to Bushire telegram No. 66—233. My telegrams Nos. 28 and 30 outlining proposals for the withdrawal of the regiment were respectively dated January 22nd and 23rd. I had, therefore, expected that these two telegrams, which concern a matter clearly affecting the Government of India would have been repeated to India telegraphically; or that even had they been posted to India by mail immediately subsequent to their arrival at Bushire, they would have reached the Government of India by now. I con sequently thought it advisable that my telegram No. should be repeated telegraphically to India, in order that the Government of India might be in possession of my full views in the matter. As, however, it appears that the telegrams referred to (Nos. 28 and 30) missed one mail at Bushire, and will not reach India till the 8th instant, it would seem that the method now proposed by Sir P. Cox for communicating the subsequent correspondence to the Government of India is suitable. As it w T Ould seem essential that the whole of the correspondence on this subject and the views hitherto expressed by various officers concerned should be communi cated to the Government of India with the least possible delay, I presume that all the correspondence which has hitherto reached and issued from their office, with the exception of such communications as were posted by last mail from Bushire, and which will reach the Government of India tomorrow, will be repeated onEebruary 8th telegraphically to India in extenso. So far as this office is acquainted with them, these communications are as follows:— My telegrams 43, 44, 46, 49, and 51. Your telegrams 25, and 35 to me. Bushire telegram No. 66. In addition to these there are tw T o telegrams, viz., your telegram No. 19 to me and No. 33 to Your Excellency from this office, which were not repeated to Bushire. Colonel Douglas would like these telegrams to be communicated by tele gram to India, and no doubt your office will arrange for this to be done.As desired in your telegram No 35, Colonel Douglas is telegraphing his views to the Indian military authorities, and he presumes that the Government of India will receive the whole of the correspondence tomorrow.

No intention exists on the part of anyone here to depreciate the efforts now being made by the Governor-General to create an effective force, nor to belittle the possible efficiency that may be attained in the future by such a body, but it is felt to be most desirable that the force should be strengthened by the co-operation of a strong gendarmerie force, which will clearly demonstrate to the tribes that the helplessness of the Central Government is not so great as they believe, whilst the presence under foreign control of these men on the trade routes will leave the Governor-General’s hands free to use the force at his disposal wherever it may be expedient for him to assert himself. Without fresh funds, the original programme cannot be carried out, and as has been pointed out by you, it is only proposed to add 400 men, whose services will be utilized to form a mobile force, which can be detached without endangering the safety of the road, and despatched to the relief or assistance of any points which may be seriously threatened. I am not without hopes that, in the event of His Majesty’s Government consenting to advance the money necessary, the scheme may be successful; at the same time, I should be desirous of assisting the Governor-General in every cSsfdway we can, without permitting myself to anticipate that the full measure of success we desire will crown his efforts, but it seems necessary in Persia to prepare for and guard against disappointments. I have mentioned to Colonel Hjalmarson the attitude of the Swedish officers, and will continue to impress the desirability of their co-operating with the civil power in all civil and military matters on him. Addressed Shiraz, No. 20, repeated Bushire, No. 40. Your telegram No. 40. His Majesty’s Resident at Bushire has for so long been in close association with the march of events in Southern Persia that he is exceptionally well fitted to judge of the effect of the policy of forbearance which has been adopted by His Majesty’s Government upon British trade and British prestige, and of the probable outcome of a continuance of such a policy. It would appear that Sir P. Cox entertains small hopes of any improvement in the situation from the gendarmerie and other measures which are in contempla tion by the Persian Government, in case His Majesty’s Government come to their assistance financially. It is but natural that this should be the case, after many previous failures. Because, perhaps, I have not been a close witness of the destruction of former hopes I am disposed to believe that the occupation of the road in force by the gendarmerie is a measure which may be productive of much good, and there should be a gain and no loss to British trade in this event. It is more difficult to gauge loss of prestige in the eyes of orientals, but I can scarcely imagine that petty attacks on British contingents by brigands, the said contingents being practically unable to retaliate, will count for much, so long as British interests are represented by men who inspire confidence, even if such insults remain unavenged. Telegram No. 3 from the Government of India, in reply to a telegram from Bushire upon which I am asked to state my views is no doubt in your possession. The Government of India and Sir P. Z. Cox, are so much better (qualified ?) than I to judge of the needs of our position in the Persian Gulf that I would restrict my remarks to a statement that I consider that we might fairly utilize the present occasion to press on the Persian Government the formal recognition of our prescriptive rights in the matters connected with Gulf navigation.

Personally I am not of the opinion that the regiment would be attacked, but the possibility is one which we must take into account, and many places exist on the road where a cavalry regiment, encumbered by a large convoy would have to fight at a great disadvantage. t I am for this reason of opinion that it would be better that we should have some support, and the despatch of a small force of infantry from Bushire to Kamarij might afford this : from Kamarij they might hold the Tang-i-Turkan and afterwards assist in guarding the defiles there and at Dalaki. If however the Political Officers here and at Bushire are of opinion that the risk of our being attacked is so small as to justify our making the journey, I am prepare to move without such support. Orders to return to India would be welcomed by the regiment provided that no likelihood exists of military operations on a larger scale in the near future, but if any chance of themselves exacting retribution for the attacks made on them exists, they would be sorry to miss it. Ends. Telegram P., No. 53-182, dated the 29th January 1913. p rom _Xhe Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To His Majesty's Minister, Tehran. (Repeated to Foreign Department; No. 182). Minister’s telegram No. 31 to Foreign Office, dated 26th January, which I repeated to you under my telegram No. 168, January 27th. Up to a certain point the deduction which His Excellency makes regarding my views and anticipations is correct, but in explanation or amplification thereof, 1 beg to offer the following observations. The present position, I understand, is as follows :— In considering the pros, and cons, of the two alternative courses, consisting respectively of (1) action by ourselves to control the Bushire-Shiraz road, and (2) the grant of a further respite to the Persian Government after the spring in the forlorn hope that within a reasonable period they may be able to achieve sufficient effective measures to afford us reparation for outrages and to satisfy the requirements of our commerce, His Majesty’s Government incline to the view that the last named is the less far-reaching evil of the two, and this is the course of which the adoption is now contemplated by them. It would seem from recent telegrams from His Majesty’s Minister that the adoption of this course means that we shall assist in financing both the gendar merie and the Administration of Ears simultaneously. We are asked to provide ^350,000 for the former purpose, for three years’ maintenance, and it is recom mended by Sir W. Townley that a sum of ;£ 100,000 be provided now to meet their requirements during the next ten months. For the Governor-General, it is estimated by Major O’Connor that from £40,000 to 50,000 will be needed to enable him to maintain security and collect revenue for the next three or four months, while His Majesty’s Minister thinks that it should be sufficient if £30,000 was given for the present. I do not gather however, that the cost of a punitive expedition against the tribes responsible for the attacks on Smart and Eckford is specifically provided for in either of the above estimates, yet the decided conviction has been expressed by gendarmerie officers here (and I concur with them) that action in this direction is a sine qud non to the success of their schemes. The machinery however will, in any case come to a stop, when the contri butions mentioned above are expended, for from Major O’Connor’s recent telegrams it would seem that even if the revenue of the province be recovered m full, it will not meet both the cost of the gendarmerie and that of the civil5 pirttnb onsistiog d, spring in adiiere itisffifi ;lie ?iet ie course conin' recem fered 1 ” tlecird administration; It is, furthermore, still problematical whether Mukhbir-es-SaUaneh will be able to rise to the situation at all, whether from financial point of view or any other. His predecessor was capable though dishonest, he himself seems to be honest, but not very capable. ^ It is the above prospect which I regard with so little hopefulness. On the other hand, if the onus of financing the province and the gendarmerie for a pro longed period, say ten years, on a definite basis, is a burden which His Majesty’s Government are ready to assume, and if they can arrange in the meantime to promote railway enterprise actively in the same sphere, 1 am not prepared to say that for some considerable time intervention might not be staved off, so far as Fars is concerned. But I fear even then that we shall be liable at any moment to be let in badly by any Governor-General whom the Persians can produce so that money advanced would be but a precarious investment; I believe too that the administration would quickly relapse into chaos directly we ceased to finance and control it, owing to the fact that the peasantry are now well armed and are conscious of their power, while men of sufficient honesty of purpose and capability to take up the reins when we lay them down cannot be produced by Persia now, nor could they be produced in the present generation. I may here mention that among intelligent Persians of the mercantile class and the headmen of the hinterland with whom we are in touch here, it is a matter of conviction that the Central Government has permanently lost control of Persian Baluchistan and Luristan and that in Fars likewise the disease has advanced beyond the point of recovery, and that it is unlikely that the Persian Government will ever be able to regain effective control. It was in the above attitude of mind that I submitted the opinion that we could sufficiently vindicate our commercial interests and position by assuming control of the Bushire-Shiraz road, and that this done, we could leave to its fate the administration of the province and the general restoration of order, in the hope that the Governor-General, freed of responsibility for the trade route, might find his hands strengthened for other purposes. The British Exchequer, by financing indefinitely the administration as well as the gendarmerie, without full control of either, seems to me to be undertaking liability more risky than the holding of the road would involve, and one which promises less advantage to our commerce. If, however, it is decided by His Majesty’s Government, owing to its probable effect on the policy of the Russian Government, that military action of any kind by themselves is inexpedient, then I w r ould venture to urge, with great respect but very earnestly, that the financial position and outlook should be made the object of a searching diagnosis as well as the complete decrepitude of the administrative machinery of the country (pace factitious journalistic state ments to the contrary) and that this diagnosis once made, we should take upon ourselves, deliberately and constructively, at whatever cost and for whatever period may be indicated by the enquiry mentioned above, such measures as may be shown to be essential for the cure of the patient, if indeed such is within the bounds of possibility, and for the preservation of our larger and ultimate interests. I would further venture to urge that the policy on which we have decided should be stated in Parliament or in the Press, as soon as we have reached a final decision, or at all events as soon as spring draws near, and that, whatever temporary loss of credit may be involved thereby, we should then form our local dispositions accordingly. Telegram P., No. 48, dated the 30th (received 31st) January 1913. From—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Your telegram 53-182 has been repeated with the following observations to His Majesty’s Foreign Office. Begins. ■6 It i s stated by Sir P. Z. Cox that it is the opinion of the gendarmerie officers at Bushire that a sine qud non of the success of the gendarmerie schemes in Pars is a punitive expedition against the tribes. I do not think that this view is shared by the Swedish Commandant. He attaches some importance to the co-operation of such local forces as it may be ^ possible for the Governor-General to collect, but it is not anticipated either by him, or by me, that it will be possible to form a force capable of undertaking a punitive expedition against the powerful tribes concerned, if unsupported. The most that is hoped is that order may be gradually restored in Pars and punishment exacted from the tribes who may be proved guilty. My latest advices from Shiraz are to the effect that the Governor-General’s plans have been seriously affected by the decision not to endeavour to bring up from Bushire the arms and ammunition belonging to the gendarmerie, and that the decision has moreover caused the contemplated expedition against Muham mad AH Khan to be abandoned by the Darya Begi {vide my telegram 648) and has forced him to return to Shiraz without having effected anything. This circumstance is reported by Major O’Connor to have greatly dama ged the prestige of the Governor-General, whilst he states that the Qawam has commenced to intrigue against the Governor-General with a view to prevent ing recruits from offering themselves, or arrears of taxes from being collected. I am not in accord with the views expressed to the effect that after the end of the three years, whhin which it is hoped that order will have been restored by the gendarmerie, the revenues of Pars will be insufficient to meet the expenses of the administration and of the gendarmerie. It is perhaps very doubtful whether order can possibly be restored, but if this can be achieved, the richest province in Persia should be self-supporting. Repeated, to Foreign, No. 197, dated January 31st, 1913. Telegram P., No. 55-198, dated the 31st January 1913. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. Proposed 'withdrawal of Central India Horse from Shiraz. Your telegram No. 43. From the point of view of the regiment the position is unsatisfactory and I quite realize this and sympathize with them. But in my opinion the question of their withdrawal should depend entirely on the policy to be adopted by His Majesty’s Government, and is not susceptible of treatment from a detached or local standpoint. Should it be decided by His Majesty’s Government that no action is to be I taken in the spring, but that decision will be deferred till the autumn, then I consider that the regiment should remain at Shiraz until the autumn. On the other hand, should it be announced by His Majesty’s Government either now, or in the spring, or in autumn, that it has been definitely decided to take no overt measures themselves, but that they are prepared to give the Persian Government support and financial assistance, until the latter is in a position to regain control and restore order, then it might be publicly announced at the same time that it was our intention to withdraw the troops, as a factor in that policy, and we could then take steps to put the intention into execution. If the gendarmerie had not got the Kazrun route as a whole sufficiently under control at that juncture, to preclude the risk of an attack being made on the troops, then the Ispahan route could be used, or it would probably be quite possible to come to a friendly understanding (after such a declaration as that mentioned above) with the Sowlet-ud-Dowleh, for immunity on the Firuzabad route.In my opinion, however, the troops should either march out as through a friendly country on their own bottoms, or, alternatively, should be withdrawn incidentally in the course of adequate military measures taken by ourselves for the control of the road. The extrication of the regiment under the wing of the gendarmerie and the Governor-General’s force, without any declaration or certainty of policy on the part of His Majesty’s Government, seems to me to be open to great objection. The gendarmerie and the Governor-General’s force might welcome the arrange ment, but it is evident that they would be in a position to make a good deal of capital out of it, and our recent experience indicates that they would be prone to do so. Lastly, according to my personal ideas the suggestion that the small party here, acting as if in a hostile country could, or should, proceed to endeavour to hold the passes between here and Kazrun, the Tang-i-Turkan pass included, is wholly unsound and unworkable—that the Military authorities would look at it I do not believe.

[6247] No. 1. Sir W . Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 10.) {No. 10.) Sir, Tehran, January 18, 1913. WITH reference to my telegram No. 17 of the 12 th instant, I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of a precis of a verbal communication made to me by the Ala-us-Sultaneh, then Minister for Foreign Affairs, on the same day, upon the subject of the measures that the Persian Government are desirous of taking to re-establish order in the south, guarantee the security of the trade routes and eventually punish those guilty of the attack on Mr. Consul Smart in December 1911, of the murder of Captain Eckford on the 11 th December, 1912, and of various other outrages. The document in question, which was handed to me by Ala-us-Sultaneh at the conclusion of our conversation, was drawn up in English at the Foreign Office, and contains a fairly faithful summary of what his Highness said to me. I have also the honour to enclose a copy ol a programme drawn up by the Swedish colonel commanding the gendarmerie, showing the strength of the force it is proposed to maintain on the Ispahan-Bushire road from Yezdikhast to the latter place, and the estimated cost of its maintenance^ Ala-us-Sultaneh laid stress upon the fact that the season of the year had made it impossible for the Governor-General to take effective punitive measures, but he pointed out that active preparations are being made, and that it is seriously hoped that it will be found possible to take some decisive action next spring. The Persian Government are, however, he added, seriously desirous, not only to punish those actually guilty of outrages, but also to re-establish order and security on the southern trade routes. For this purpose he recommended the programme drawn up by Colonel Hjalmarson to my earnest consideration, in the hope that I would submit the same to you, Sir, in such a manner as would ensure its favourable reception. His Highness added that the Persian Government have unfortunately no means at their disposal to meet the heavy expenses that must be incurred in the carrying out of this scheme, and, with some hesitation, he expressed a hope that His Majesty’s Government might see fit to advance the money required for the purpose, namely, 350,000Z. to the Persian Government under such guarantees as might be considered desirable that the money would be devoted to that and no other purpose. It would not be necessary, he said, for the whole sum to be advanced at once, but it was essential for the satisfactory execution of the scheme that the Persian Government could rest assured that the money would be forthcoming when wanted. In conclusion, Ala-us-Sultaneh expressed an earnest hope that His Majesty’s Government would once more show forbearance, and would take no drastic step of a nature to embarrass the new Cabinet at the outset of its arduous task. He expressed great concern at an article which had just appeared in the “ Times.” He said that he had the evening before received a telegraphic summary of this article, which contained many hard things about Persia, and seemed to foreshadow the despatch of a military expedition, and he asked if the “ Times ” now expressed the views of His Majesty’s Government. I replied that I was not yet in possession of the decision that had been come to on this question, if, indeed, any had actually been taken, but I said that it was improbable that the “ Times ” wmuld have learned the determination of His Majesty’s Government before 1 had been officially informed of the same. I took occasion to hint that I had heard that the Governor-General of Fars was still uncertain as to who were the real authors of the outrage that had cost Captain Eckford his life, and that his Excellency had telegraphed to the Bakhtiari khans suggesting that the projected movement on the part of the Bakhtiaris against the Boer ahmadis should be stayed until he (Mukhber-es-Sultaneh) was in possession of more definite information. I said that it would be a pity to run the risk of stirring up a tribal warfare that might have far- reaching consequences unless one was quite sure of one’s ground. As discreetly as possible 1 hinted that the Bakhtiaris enjoy an unenviable reputation for pillage and [2804 k —17] Not printed.

I was careful not to afford a loophole for it to be said in the future that we had forbidden the Persian Government to make use of the only punitive force in their possession, and that they had consequently been unable to offer the reparation that they had been desirous of making. I understand from outside sources that the local Bakhtiari khans, who would naturally be called upon to lead a force against the Boer ahmadis have at once demanded large sums of money, ^ as was to be anticipated, from the Government to meet the cost of the rumoured expedition. I am decidedly of opinion that the only force that can hope to restore any permanent order in Pars is the gendarmerie. Their record in the south has not so far been a very satisfactory one, but it must be borne in mind that the young officers employed at Shiraz have had to compete single-handed against the opposition and intrigues of the local authorities without having the visible support of the two legations and of the Central Government, as has been the case at Tehran. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure 1 in No. 1 . Precis of a Verbal Communication made by the Ala-us-Sultaneh to Sir W. Townley. MY Government, realising the all-important necessity of improving public security and maintaining order on the trade routes, are most anxious that the gendarmerie organisation, entrusted to the Swedish officers, and to which much attention and money have already been devoted, should be enabled to develop more rapidly. Having consulted our military and financial advisers, it is manifest that our best efforts in this direction are completely paralysed by the embarrassed state of our finances. On the other hand, the recent unfortunate incident near Dasht-i-Arjin, where a gallant young British officer was accidentally killed whilst out on a shooting expedition, is a strong incentive to our earnest desire to clear up once and for all the burning question of the policing of the southern roads. Although the season of the year precludes any immediate effective action, measures are already being taken by the Governor-General of Ears and other local authorities to punish the responsible tribe, and a force of about 1,000 gendarmes, well-trained and equipped, will be sent out early in the spring to Shiraz, whilst a convoy of arms and ammunition, including Maxim guns, recently purchased in Europe, will shortly be escorted from Bushire to°the same locality. e feel, however, that m order to achieve complete success and arrive more speedily at a permanent state of calm and tranquillity, it is imperative, for the present requirements of the road, to organise, m addition to fixed posts of gendarmes patrolling the highways, detaenments of flying columns, stationed in various important centres, which can be concentrated at any given moment as powerful striking forces. Having particularly in view the speedy improvement of order in the south, we have appioved of a scheme drawn up by Colonel Hjalmarson, chief instructor of the gendarmerie, of which a copy has been handed to your Excellency, fixing the annual budget of expenses for the immediate necessities of Ears. I now, therefore, have recourse to your Excellency’s good offices for an advance by your Government of 350 , 000 L (to be reimbursed by the big loan which will shortly be negotiated) of which only a-half will immediately be required, this sum to be set aside by the treasurer-general of Persia at the complete disposal of Colonel Hjalmarson, and entirely allocated to the lequirements of public security m Ears for a period of three years, duiing which the above scheme could be steadily and satisfactorily carried out without let or hindrance whatsoever. I rely upon the friendly feelings of your Excellency for Persia to put the above request in a favourable light before your Government and to recommend it strongly as the only piacticable and sure means of improving the situation and of avoiding the very serious complications which any other alternative measure would most assuredly entail to the prejudice of both British and Persian interests.

(Repetition of telegram No. 23* to His Majesty's Minister, Tehran). I venture to express my concurrence with the views expressed in your tele gram No. 14 with reference to the journey of Major Brandel. I have, however, certain suggestions to make in regard to this question of arms generally, and after seeing the Governor-General this afternoon I will address you further on the subject. Telegram P., No. 21, dated (and receive !) the 20th January 1913. From—His Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. (Repetition of telegram No. 24, to His Majesty's Minister, Tehran). \ Supply to Governor General of Fart of gendarmerie arms. If, as Colonel Hjalmarson says, he needs all the 1,500 rifles now at Bushire for the gendarmerie, of course there is no more to be said on the subject. I venture, however, to make the following remarks on the subject of the Com mandant’s statements to you before troubling you with fresh proposals. Firstly .—The argument he uses that in the hands of Persians, that the rifles would soon be spoiled seems to be irrelevant. Once the arms were handed over to the Govern or-General, the Commandant is not concerned as to whether they are spoiled or not, and if the Governor-General is precluded by this argu ment from receiving these particular rifles, he is equally precluded thereby from receiving good rifles of any other kind. If the meaning of the Commandant is that the Governor-General’s new force is unfit to receive any but some useless old arms, then I venture to express my disagreement with him. It seems to me that as we are financing the Governor-General in his efforts to reorganize the province, it is only fair to him and to ourselves that we should endeavour to make these attempts real and not farcical. Secondly ,—The Commandant, in signifying that he is prepared to hand over 500 old rifles now with the gendarmerie at Shiraz to the Governor-General, as a mark of favour, seems to have forgotten that (as I have just ascertained from Major Siefvert) they only have altogether 300 old rifles here, of very inferior quality. It is to be feared, therefore, that the Governor-General will not be so grate ful as might be desired for Colonel Hjalmarson’s evidences of good will. I make these remarks not because I hope that the Commandant will recon sider his decision, for, as I have said above, if he wants the rifles, he will not give them to anyone, but because I do not think that his general attitude in the matter, as set forth in your telegram under reply, indicates any particular anxiety to see the Governor-General of Pars provided with a really efficient force. This is quite comprehensible, as the gendarmerie officers here would natu rally prefer to make their own force the sole efficient body in the province. Nevertheless, as it seems probable that this attitude will sooner or later conflict with the present policy of His Majesty’s Government, under which we are financ ing the Governor-General and encouraging him to raise a force of his own, I ven ture to trouble you with this statement regarding the Commandant’s attitude, as it appears to me. Possibly, I think, the gendarmerie have been a little too prone in their dealings with local authorities to treat them with sometimes scanty consideration. It would be a great pity if any friction or ill-feeling were allowed to developbetween gendarmerie and the present Governor-General, who is quite ready to co-operate with them in a most am.cable spirit, but at the same time expects them to recognize his dignity and position. ’ xpects As you are aware, there has already been and it is for this reason that I have ventured to observations. some slight misunderstandings, place before you the foregoing Telegram No. 40-125, dated 21st January 1913. From— The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—His Majesty's Minister, Tehran. (Repeated to Shiraz). egra r m l8th h nu . ar y- term ca ravan is used too loosely to make it practicable to frame statistics on a caravan basis. Latter must be based pn numbers of transport animals. Without special arrangements it is exceed ingly difficult to get precise information, as local authorities are interested in falsifying numbers^ For some months past we have provided ourselves tempo rarily with rough figures on payment both here and from Borasjun, through telegraph Ghulams, but we cannot maintain this or do anything more extensive without some special arrangement. I would now request Your Excellency to ask Director of Telegraphs if he could see his way to have intructions issued to Head Gholam at Kaz^run as well as at Borasjun to report weekly to^ Bushire number of animals passing up and down. His Majesty s Consul, Shiraz, wmuld probably find similar report from Dastarjin a useful check on Shiraz estimates. Necessity for independent information in Kazerun is due to fact that many mules, especially at certain seasons, only do half the journey and loads are left to accumulate there. In my opinion regular remuneration to Ghulams employed would be neces sary at say Rs. 3 per month in each case, with similar payments at Bushire and Shiraz ; total annual expenditure south of Shiraz would be £12. If this system were also introduced between Shiraz and Ispahan we should have a fairly reliable means of getting statistics of internal trade, and I trust you will move His Majesty’s Government to sanction expenditure. Addressed His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, repeated Shiraz. Telegram No. 126, dated 21st January 1913. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—His Majesty's Consul, Shiraz. Commercial Adviser suggests that as Governor-General has started a new chapter of administration of Pars and is being specifically financed it would be a reasonable arrangement and one calculated to encourage and inspire confidence in despondent traders here and at Shiraz if instances of caravan robbery which have occurred or may occur subsequent to date of his arrival Shiraz should be promptly settled by him on proof, out of the funds with which he is provided. Apart from direct interests of traders existence of such an arrangement would keep Governor General up to the mark in following up each case strenuously. Please let me know’ if you can join me in supporting suggestion. As far as we know here, not many claims have so far been lodged. What is your total to date. Telegram No. 22, dated (and received) 21st January 1913. From—His Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. (Repetition of lelegram No. 25 to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran). I should not have ventured to trouble you with any observations regarding Ala-es-Saltaneh’s scheme for the increase of the gendarmerie in Pars, were itnot for the fact that it is exclusively this particular province which is affected by his proposals, which cannot fail to react upon questions of local administration and provincial finance. The opinion has been expressed by the Ala-es-Saltaneh that order can be restored in Pars only by means of the scheme proposed by the Swedish Com mandant. He has no doubt good reasons for expressing such a view, but I find it difficult to understand why an increase of the gendarmes in Pars from 1.400 (the number allotted at present under the gendarmerie scheme) to 1,800 should of necessity bring about the desired consummation. Nor do I understand why His Highness should ignore all that is now being done, and proposed, by the Mukhbir, to raise a local force and to provide road guards. Might I, without in any way wishing to belittle or even criticize the details of the Colonel’s scheme, suggest that we should at any rate watch the course of events at Shiraz during the next few months before we give our support to any such extensive financial proposals, or any extension of the present pro gramme of the gendarmerie. « If it becomes apparent during the course of the next 6 or 8 months that satisfactory progress is not being made with the proposed arrangements of the Governor-General, and that it is the gendarmerie force alone that can do any good to the province, then it will be time enough to consider a more ambitious programme for giving them wider scope : in the meanwhile I venture to think that the Governor-General’s own plans are sufficient to meet the necessities of the case. As to the financial aspect of the matter, 1 need only remind Your Excel lency that in favourable circumstances the normal revenues of Pars amount to about ^ 150,000 whilst normal provincial expenditure will probably come to £80,000 or £90,000, the cost of the gendarmerie being excluded. But for the next year or two the revenues cannot be expected to be as much as £ 100,000; it is therefore clear that although it mav in the furure be possible to meet out of provincial revenues the cost of a small force of gandarmes, this is not at present possible, and under the circumstances it would be best perhaps to allow experience to develop slowly in accordance wdth changes in the situation, rather than accept as constituting the only means of salvation, the enlarged programme put forward by Colonel Hjalmarson. Telegram No. 23, dated (and received) the 21st January 1913. From—-His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. (Repetition of telegram No. 26, to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran). Arms for Governor-General, , 6 proposal made in your telegram No. 12 that arms and ammunition should be obtained by the Governor-General from India is gladly accepted by hmi. He begs me to address you on the subject forthwith and to ask you to be so goo as to make the necessary arrangements with the Government of India. 1,000 rifles are wanted, with 500,000 rounds of ammunition.

I did not suggest that I should procure arms for the Governor-General, but that he himself should get them.

C82FD6 Telegram P., No. 24, dated (and received) the 22nd January 1913. From—His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. (Repetition of telegram No. 28 His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran). Please refer to my telegram No. 19. I am now informed by Major Siefvert that with a view to avoiding the expense and risk involved by two separate caravans, Major Brandel will stay at Eushire till the Swedish Commandant arrives in Pars when it will be arranged for arms, ammunition and recruits to be brought up simultaneously. When exactly this will be I do not know, but if the Commandant considers himself strong enough to make the necessary arrangements with the help of his first detachment at Shiraz with the support of gendarmerie here and at Shiraz, it will presumably be possible to arrange the journey some time in April. It occurs to me that in this event it would be an excellent opportunity to make arrangements for the return to India of the 39th Central India Horse. I have abstained hitherto from making any specific representations on the subject to you, but having perused the correspondence on the subject in this office and examined the actual situation on the spot, I now venture to recom mend that this regiment should leave this town as soon as possible. It is, I think, generally admitted that the despatch of troops was an unfortunate mistake. The first proposal under which they were to escort caravans having been shown to be quite impracticable, there remained no good reason why they should have been sent here at all. In any case cavalry are practically useless on such a road as that from Bushire to Shiraz, and if there was any real necessity for reinforce ments to the Consular guards here and at Shiraz, infantry would have been more suited in every way for the purpose. # * Moreover, the despatch to Shiraz, and the presence here of this regiment have led directly to all the principal troubles and difficulties which have beset Pars since December 1911. The difference between attacks on Major Birdwood’s and Smart’s escort and ordinary robberies by robber bands is: that the former were organized attacks by well-known villagers and tribesmen and villages on British troops. A number of minor incidents have occurred since the first attacks, culminat ing in Captain Eckford’s death last month. Kvery one, of these incidents may be ber 22nd, 1912. attributed directly to the presence in Pars of the Central India Horse. No blame can be attached in any instance to the officers or men, whose conduct has been beyond praise throughout, under most trying circumstances, but the fact remains that but for their presence here incidents such as these could not have occurred. They are in fact in a false position, and will so remain pending their removal, or the exaction of retribution for their injur.;es. As regards the latter policy, it is to be hoped that the gendarmerie may be strong enough in course of time (possibly during the ensuing summer or autumn) to exact reparation from the principal culprits. All that is possible, at any rate, is being done to enable this to be effected, and sooner or later it is to be hoped that some effective punitive measures may be adopted, but anyone acquainted with the internal conditions of Persia must be aware that it is not practicable to take such steps forthwith. Hitherto Persia has had neither money nor armed forces, and it is an impossibility to expect a country without either to tak e military action. I am not unaware of the argument that has been brought forward that a serious loss of prestige will be involved by the withdrawal of the regiment before' reparation is exacted, but in considering the question I do not think that this argument can be allowed to weigh very seriously. The regiment might with advantage remain here until the necessary steps have been taken, if it is the intention of His Majesty’s Government to exact reparation themselves; if this is not the case, then I see no good object in keeping them here for another day.„™iSsfc “,al, ru l sr,'SoT,±H o, ;' d v',,^ *f\ i.».».,««ac involved to ,he“SS ho”5i, T.d Z T’ ' ''r'* 1 necessitated. ^ cnemseives, and the heavy expenditure regiment stuldTeturn 'toTndlr 2 * * ' 7 ° f ° Pini0n aS S ° 0n “ P° ssib,e the telegram.'' 1 mdlCate h ° W 1 think this i ourt, ey '“ight be arranged in a subsequent Extract from Reuter’s dated 23 rd January 1913 . ■ P ^ rslan Legation denies that Swedish gendarmes are unequal to task of nolic- ing trade routes and that they are disheartened.

It seems hardly fair, in considering the a titi.de of Colonel Hjalmarson in the matter of rifles to attribute to him motives of hostility or jealousy because he does not see his way to let the Governor- General have modern weapons to obtain which from Europe has taken t8 months and which, he himself requires. It must not be forgotten that the gendarmerie forms part of general scheme for the gradual restoration of order throughout Persia, with the special object of putting off if possible the day when the country will be practically partitioned by the presence of Russian officers in the north and British in the south. His Majesty’s Government are most anxious to avoid this if it can be done, and for that reason we must support the gendar merie as far as we can. 53 The Commandant, I think, counts greatly on the co-operation he hopes to receive from the Governor-General, but I consider that it is for the latter to make his own arrangements for obtaining the arms which he requires. Your comments on the scheme for the development of the gendarmerie in ars show, I think, some misapprehension of the situation. 1,400 men were originally estimated for, it is true, but this force could never have been raised without additional funds, seeing that the resources of the Persian Government are wholly insufficient to meet the cost. It must not surprise you if some doubt is felt here as to the probable efficacy of the preparations to restore order on which the Governor-General is now engaged. Our own records, and those of the Persian Government, serve to show that such efforts, however strenuous, have had small effect in the past, and for that reason it appears essential to us that we should have a second string to our bow in the form of a strong gendarmerie. I quite understand that the Mukhbir-es-Sultaneh is a superior person, and more honest than his predecessors, but it seems to me that his efforts to restore order by means of a force under his own control will benefit greatly by the presence on the roads of the gendarmerie, provided that the two pull together.I am unable to agree with you that we can afford to wait and see whether or not the Governor-General’s force proves a success. In the face of our past experiences, it seems to me most desirable that the gendarmerie should be developed as much as possible, and at the earliest possible date, but we should equally give to the Governor-General all the support we can in his efforts to restore order, which I do not believe he is capable of doing unaided. There is nothing to show that Pars will be called on to provide funds for the maintenance of the gendarmerie. If funds are obtained they will be a charge on the Central Government, and devoted to meeting expenses involved by the gendarmerie schemes now in progress. Telegram P„ No. 30, dated (and received) the 23rd January 1913. From—His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, To—&gt;His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. (Repeated Bushire No 25). My telegram 28. The following is my idea for the return of the Central India Horse to India. When the gendarmerie leave Shiraz in the direction of Bushire in order to escort arms caravan from the coast the regiment might go with them as far as they go along the road to Bushire. Colonel Douglas and Colonel Hjalmarson would arrange the actual details in conjunction, but it seems certain that the united force, together with local levies, and such men of the Governor-General’s new force as may be ready by that time, and provided with arms should be able to force a passage against any opposition that it is likely to be offered, when they are working in conjunction with Major Brandel’s force from Bushire. The following is a rough calculation of the strength of the force :—• Central India Horse 420 Gendarmerie from Shiraz, say ... • •t 400 Local Tufangchis, say ... • •• 700 to 800 Total • • • 1,500 to 1,600 men. It could no doubt be arranged that the Bushire force should advance to Borasjun or even to Kamarij. Forces would meet at a selected point, regiment proceeding down the road to Bushire, and the gendarmerie returning with the arms caravan to Shiraz. In my opinion the above would involve but little risk. The strength of the force would be sufficient to inspire respect, and to be effective, whilst the fact that the advance was made from two directions would tend to disconcert the tribesmen. ^j 6r c ' rcums l ;ances » however, it seems unlikely that any resistance at all would be offered. To make the position still more secure, and if considered desirable, the arms caravan might be accompanied by a detachment of infantry from Bushire as far as the rendezvous of the two columns : they might return thence with the cavalry. At any rate, it will, I think, be a long time before any better opportunity tor extricating the regiment from its present embarrassing situation here is likely to present itself. April is suitable for movements both by land and by sea, and if the movement takes place in that month, the fact of the tribesmen being then on the road would, 1 think, on the whole render them less capable of offering serious opposition than they would be at other times. a bove views have the general concurrence of Colonel Douglas, whom I have consulted, and who considers the project feasible and not unduly risky. * venture to suggest that a separate expression of his opinion be obtained. Repeated Bushire, 25.9 ; Telegram P., No. Si, dated (and received) 24th January 19,3. From—His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, To--His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. (Repeated Bushire, No. 26). ♦ Your telegram No. 17. From your telegram No. 12 I understood you to mean that the Governor General should apply for the arms and ammunition he wants to the Government of India. This, at any rate, is the only way that I can see for him to obtain them. His needs could be supplied without difficulty by Inaia from the stocks of discarded Government rifles lying in the arsenals. The most suitable weapon, as I have already stated in my telegram No 26, would be the long Lee-Enfield rifle which is now being replaced in the India Army by the short Lee-Enfield. Precedents exist for the supply of rifles to such countries as Nepal, but, seeing that it is not possible for the Governor-General to address the Government of India himself, and subject to your concurrence, I think that the suggestion would come most suitably from you, or I could address the Government of India myself, with your permission. The permission of the Persian Government must of course be obtained, but under the circumstances it is to be presumed that there could be no possible objection on their part. With regard to the question of paying for the arms: You are aware that neither the Persian Government nor the Governor-General have money for the purpose of immediate payment, and this fact effectually precludes them from making purchases in the open market at Maskat or elsewhere, besides which the arms would cost very much less if purchased from the Government of India than if they were bought from dealers or agents. I trust therefore that the Government of India may be approached with a view to letting the Governor-General have these arms, payment of which should be made out of the proceeds of the next big loan, or out of the last advance for the administration of Ears, whichever may be most suitable. The Government of India should suffer no loss and but little inconvenience by the above, as in any case the old rifles stocked at the arsenals are so much locked up capital and unremunerative as such, whereas dealers would want ready cash, or at the least would charge interest on unpaid accounts. I regret to have to trouble you with this lengthy explanation, but the above seems to me the only way to get arms for the Governor-General, and you will, I am sure, agree with me in thinking that it is most necessary that he should be placed in possession of them without delay. We are pressing the Persian Government to restore order and to punish rebellious tribesmen and robbers, and we are advancing money with the object of bolstering up the tottering administration of this province. We may, in the circumstances, very well ask the Government of India to help the Persian Gov ernment in this task by letting them have a few old rifles and some ammunition, even though payment for the same may be delayed. I venture therefore to suggest that you should in the first place obtain the sanction of the Persian Government to the importation of 1,000 rifles and 500,000 rounds, and then address the Government of India yourself, or else authorize me or Sir P. Z. Cox to approach them. Repeated Bushire, No. 26. Telegram P., Nos. 48 - 159 , dated 25th January 1913. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran.

They could only be obtained by payment in advance if purchased at Maskat.If it is definitely decided that we have no intention of taking action ourselves in the spring, and contemplate allowing the gendarmerie and the Governor- General to experiment for another period on the road problem, then, if there is no objection on the part of the Persian Government, I do not consider that 1,000 rifles with 500 rounds per weapon would be an excessive provision, and I concur in thinking that the Government of India might reasonably be asked to $ assist in the matter, so far as they feel able to do so, up to that amount the cost being adjusted in the Imperial account against the Persian Government.* I am, however, rather doubtful as to whether the rifles could be spared by the Government of India. Possibly there may be 200 or 300 rifles available from recent captures by His Majesty’s ships. If the Government of India are able to supply the arms, I would suggest their being consigned to the Commandant of the detachment of British troops here as ^ measure of precaution, and sent up by instalments or en bloc to Shiraz by such safe opportunity as may be arranged by the Governor-General.

On re-reading your telegrams Your Excellency will, 1 think, find that I make no adverse criticism therein of the gendermerie as such. Indeed I venture to say that your hopes in regard to this force are entirely shared by me, and I am prepared to assist them by every means at my disposal and to encourage the Governor-General to do likewise. 1 would further state that it was merely upon grounds of financial policy and expediency that I deprecated any attempt to extend the programme of the gendermerie with undue rapidity. As you know they have not been uniformly successful in the south, and I know as a fact that even now the Swedish officers do not fully realize the nature of the problem which confronts them. It would seem merely prudent and reasonable to move with some circum spection in the matter, and, before actually recommending any further extension, to allow the present fairly extensive programme to develop. This opinion was merely advanced for Your Excellency’s own consideration with great deference. A regards the financial aspect of the question, you are of course in a position to form judgment on the matter, which I cannot pretend to do. I only tried to explain the inadequacy of the revenues of this province to meet the cost of the gencermerie. Secondly.~\ deprecate the tendency exhibited both by my Commandant and by the Central Government and voiced by Ala-es-Saltaneh, to depreciate or ignore the plans made for the reform of Ears by the Mukhbir-es-Saltaneh. As you are aware I am no blind admirer of Persian methods and am fully acquainted with the short-cpmmings of a Persian military force, but at the same time, having regard to the fact that we are giving encouragement to the Governor-General in the training of an effective force, and are actually provid ing him with funds to do so, it seems to me (and with this I feel sure that you will agree) that to accept without remonstrance remarks such as those made by the Commandant of the gendermerie is a little illogical. . Your Excellency and the Persian Government are deliberately of the opinion that any efforts made to raise a local force will of necessity be futile, then there is no excuse for us to expend further money on futile experiipents. If on the other hand we believe that some good result my accure from the experiments, then I think we should give it all possible assistance and encour agement here and in Tehran. 1 o allow the impression to spread that the Governor-General s new force is looked down by us as a negligible quantity will certainly end in its becoming so.In any further communication on this subject, please quote n». 55840/12. \ and address— The Under-Secretary of State.

I hnvp fire* ’ WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure 1 No. 1. Acting-Consul Smart to Sir W. Townley. (No. 23.) J Sir, Shiraz, November 4, 1912. BEFORE leaving Shiraz I wish to record my grateful appreciation of the manner in which Colonel J. A. Douglas has facilitated my work in matters regarding the troops under his command at Shiraz. The position of the troops here has not been easy or pleasant. Colonel Douglas’s tact and forbearance, combined with his considerable experience of Persia, have largely contributed to smoothing away difficulties and to obviating regrettable incidents. In all the trivial cases necessitating negotiations with the local authorities he has consistently facilitated my task by his moderation. Several cases have occurred in which the men and their officers have, under misapprehensions, been fired at by villagers or local tufangchis. In such cases, realising that the shots were being fired under misappre hension, they have refrained from retaliation, which might have resulted in untoward complications, and have, after at some danger getting into communication with the villagers or tufangchis, averted bloodshed by timely explanations. Colonel Douglas has always refrained from attaching too much importance to such incidents. Owing to the disturbed state of the Shiraz Valley during the greater part of the last ten months the free circulation of the troops, either in bodies or individually, in the neighbourhood of the town would in all probability have led to disagreeable incidents. Colonel Douglas, in spite of the great inconvenience involved, did much to obviate such incidents by circumscribing the movements of his officers and men according to the changing exigencies of the local situation. But for his tactful attitude, I doubt whether this year would have passed without serious incidents in connection with the troops. Although it may savour of presumption on my part, I cannot while on this subject refrain from expressing my appreciation of the attitude of the officers and men generally in their relations with the native population. Owing to the good-humour and tolerance [2763 n—11]2 of both officers and men the sentiments of the townsmen and villagers towards our troops have been of the friendliest nature. I have, &amp;c. W. G.

Smith, assistant superintendent of the Indo-European TeWrnnh Department, and his staff in Ears. ° ^ My precedessors and myself have Mten had occasion to allude to the advantages accruing to this consulate from Mr. Smith’s long local experience, the assistance he has always so willingly lent in dealings with tribal or village headmen, in helping to arrange f-the passage of British travellers, in keeping the consulate informed of developments m different parts of the province. As the disorders have increased this assistance has grown more valuable. Moreover, Mr. Smith’s coolness and prudence have rendered his co-operation peculiarly reliable.

The present lull after the southward migration of the tribes and the arrival of the new Governor-General would seem an appropriate time for a review of the general situation in Ears during the past six months. In my despatch,f No. 9, of 23rd May last, I endeavoured to represent the t Enclosure to Semi No. 46 . situation such as it was after the defeat , . Sowlet-ed-Dowleh and his retirement to the lowlands around Eiruznbad. The following two months were a period of extraordinary calm as far as the neighbourhood of Shiraz was concerned Indeed, I have never, during my rwo sojourns at Shiraz, known the vicinity of the town so peaceful. However, the improvement in the situation at and around Shiiaz was not reflected on the trade-routes or in the outlying districts This unexpected peace was due partly to the appeasement of the Kasb^ai- Khamseh strife, partly to the skilful administration of Kawam-ul-Mulk and partly to the salutary effect produced by the downfall of a chieftain, around whom a legend, highly detrimental to the authority of the Government, had grown up. But it soon became evident that this' peace had no elements of stability in it. The main factors in its break up were the question of the attacks on our troops and the pretensions of Muhammad Ali Khan, Kashkuli. The Ilk ban i in the north was, with some severity, endeavouring to obtain a real control over the tribes. He had imprisoned Ayyaz Kiha, the kalant ir of the Harashoori section of the Kashgais. This chief, responsible for many of the Kashgai robberies of recent years, was the last kalantar to Sowlet-ed-Dowleh, and his final submission was of doubtful value, replaced by Ali Penah Kiha, a strong partisan of the Ilkhani, allegiance of the important Darashoori tribe was thus secured. The of the Snislibulakis, who effectively guarded the Sarhad route, were loyal and even paid some maliyyat. The chiefs of the Earsirnadani tribe, which was retained near Shiraz, were also loyal, but their control over their followers, many of wnom were far from loyal, was very slight. The Kashkulis, who* controlled the upper part of the Bushire road, were perhaps the strongest supporters of the Government. The lesser tribes were easily kept submissive. Gradually the Tikhani was consolidating his position, endeavouring to collect maliyyat. It is fairly certain that, in the administration of the tribe, he dis played considerable rapacity, which alienated many sympathies. His administration of Abadeh through Amir-ul-Mulk differed little from the normal, rapacious tribal government in the Ears districts and even provoked a bast ” of several Abadeh notables in the Indo-European Telegraph Office there. By direct friendly negotiations I was able to induce Amir-ul-Mulk to come to terms with the “ bastis ”, who finally left the Telegraph Office. Ye abandon He was and the majoritythe general tendency of the Ilkhani’s tribal administration was good from ti e political point of view. Be was obviously endeavouring to bring tiie Kasbgai tribes under the control of the Government, which, however, was unable to lend him the necessary support for the attainment of this object. Probably few of the kalantars viewed with favour this growing consolida tion of the Ilkhani’s power, but there was one kalantar whom ir gravely menaced. That kalantar was Muhammad Ali Khan. This chieftain had long been the mainstay of Sowlet-ed-Dowleh, and the withdrawal of lus support from Sowlet-ed-Dowleh had been the main factor in the latter’s down fall. He is at present the most powerful of the Kashgai kalantars, thougu he has many enemies, even among the Kashkulis. He was quick to realise that the consolidation of the Ilkhani’s power would not only prejudice his advanta geous position but would even involve him in considerable personal danger. Kawam-ul-Mulk and the llkhani were pressing him hard for the surrender of the culprits of the attacks of our troops. If the llkhani were allowed to grow much stronger, this pressure might take the form of forcible action. Muham mad Ali Khan began to show signs of restlessness. He demanded the release of Ayyaz Kiha, knowing that it would strike a fatal blow at the Ilkhani’s power. Sardar Ihtisham and Kawam-ul-Mulk refused to entertain his request in spite of many menacing letters and veiled threats of secession to Sowlet- ed-Dowleh. I am inclined to think that the Persian Government missed their chance by postponing all action pending the arrival of the Governor-General. If, at the end of June, when it became apparent that Muhammad Ali Khan would not surrender the culprits, the Persian Government had ordered Kavvam-ul- Mulk and the llkhani to proceed to punitive measures for their apprehension, it is just possible that the undertaking might have been successful. Muham mad Khan, cousin and bitter rival of Muhammad Ali Khan, expressed the opinion, in the course of a visit he paid me towards the end of August, that the most urgent need of the situation was not action against Sowlet-ed-Dowleh but action against Muhammad Ali Khan. The sequel was to show that this opinion, though prompted by personal animosity, was correct. At the begin ning ,pf July, Muhammad Aii Khau’s position had considerably weakened. Muhammad Khan could no doubt have detached a large part of the Kaskulis^ and the other tribes, jealous of the predominance of the Kashkulis, could r probably have been put in motion against Muhammad Ali Khan. Failure to seize the favourable moment gave Muhammad Ali Khan time to organise his plot which resulted iu the recovery of his power and the downfall of the llkhani. Meanwhile, Kawam-ul-Muik was making arrangements to deal with the Khamseh tribes, whose lawlessness had passed all bounds. I strongly suspect that he had, through his deputy, Mirza Fazlullah Khan, sown discord between the Jabbara and Shaybani sections of the Arabs/ with a view to facilitating punitive measures against the divided tribes. Unfortunately, his departure, long delayed by the refusal ol the Persian Government to allow him to leave Shiraz, was rendered impossible by the forward movement of Sowlet-ed- Dowleh. About the middle of July, Sowlet-ed-Dowleh began to show signs of restless ness. His bands began to raid Kevar and to attack caravans of local produce going to and Irom Shiraz. A small force of Farsimadanis under their chief Masih Khan was sent to Kevar to watch these bands. At the end of July, a mixed force, five hundred strong, composed mainly of Surkhis and other Kumarrehis, of villagers from Firuzabad and other lowlands, under the command of Hassan Khan, Kasiikuli, brother-in-law of Sowlet-ed-Dowleh, advanced through Khojeh and drove the Government garrison of some 50 Kashknlis, under Gliulam Hussein Khan, Kashkuli, out of Darangan. This development resulted in the closing of the Chenar itahdar-Khan-i-Zinian st'ge of the Bushire road and the exposure of the Shiraz valley to periodical raids. Kawam-ul-Mulk began to collect an expeditionary force to re-occupy Siakh, and, if possible, to pursue the marauders to Firuzabad. In reply to his137 summons, some 800 Arabs under Muhammad Kuli Khan, brother of Asker Khan, the Shaybani chief, and two hundred Baseris came into the town. They were followed by about 200 Kashgais under Samsam-es-Sultan, a Khan of the rf isrning family. Another 200 Kashgais—Farsimadanis and Kashkulis—were also in the town. Arrangements were made for the collection of another force of Kashkulis and Farsimadanis around Khan-i-Zinian. While this expedition was being organised, Major Siefvert with 266 gendarmes occupied Chenar Babdar, with the object of watching the first stage of the Bushire road, of preventing incursions into the Shiraz valley from Siakh, and, if he considered it advisable, of subsequently co-operating with the Government » Enclosure 3 to Serial No. 52 . army against Siakh. I have reported Eidosures 2 and 3 to Serial No. 64. by telegraph* the unexpected, single- handed move made by Major Siefvert against Siakh. I have subsequently questioned Major Siefvert as to what his intentions were in making this move ment. I gather that he proposed to march to Darangan, spend the night there, and return on the next day to Shiraz via Karahagh. Apparently he thought this military promenade would present few difficulties. He doubtless underestimated the fighting value of his opponents and overestimated that of his own men. Fath-ul-Mulk, one of the Gendarmerie officers, who, formerly in the local Government cavalry, had served in many expeditions and fought last spring in this very district of Siakh against Sowlet ed-Dowleh, told me that he and other Persian officers pointed out to Major Siefvert the impossi bility of the undertaking. To add to its difficulties, the gendarmes were not provided with water bottles and had to march some ten miles through a waterless region under a blazing sun. Parched with thirst and having little 0 . , _ stomach for a fight, they were easilv + Enclosure 3 to Serial No. 64. n r j i i i tt tt-t. » c . S deleatedt by Hassan Khan s force, posted in the fortified hillocks covering Darangan. The greater part of the gendarmes surrendered without much hesitation, and finally Major Siefvert and Captain Nystrom with a few 7 men had to beat a hurried retreat. They fortunately succeeded in escaping, though Major Siefvert was slightly wounded in the stomach. The enemy released all the prisoners after stripping them. About 150 rifles and 16.000 cartridges fell into the hands of the enemy. One mountain gun, the breech of which had exploded, was abandoned on the field. The casualties were slight—two gendarmes killed and a dozen wounded, of whom two afterwards died in town. Sowiet-ed-Dowieh subsequently expressed his regret at this incident and promised to restore the captured arms and munitions, but he has not yet put his promise into execution. This disaster, apart from its bad effect on the future prospects of the Gendarmerie, had a deplorable influence on the situation. Had Major Siefvert remained at Chenar Bahdar, he could have rendered the Government useful service in escorting caravans over the first and dangerous stage of the Bushire road, in deterring Hassan Khan’s men from their frequent raids into the Shiraz valley. After the withdrawal of the Gendarmerie, caravans had to proceed under expensive Kashkuli escorts by a detour through the Tang-i- Surkh, and on one occasion Hassan Khan’s men actually raided the Shiraz valley between the town and Chenar Bahdar. Moreover, this defeat of a Government force greatly increased the audacity and prestige of the rebels. Meanwhile, serious discord had inopportunely broken out among the Arabs. Over half the Arab contingent left Shiraz for the scene of the strife. The tw 7 o parties—Jabbara and Shaybani—sat opposite each other in hostile formation around Murghab for a considerable time. However, both sides apparently decided that prudence was the better part of valour, and no further hostilities followed those which had marked the outbreak of the quarrel. Jabbaras and Shaybanis, in a state of armed and watch ful distrust, began to migrate southwards and gradually separated as their lines of migration diverged. Much bad feeling was occasioned among the Arabs by this discord which they openly attributed to Mirza Fazlullah Khan, Kawam-ul-Mulk’s Deputy. The result of this inopportune outbreak was that Kawam-ul-Mulk was deprived of invaluable Arab support for bis expedi tionary force. His inability to go out among the Arabs and profit by thediscord he himself had probably sown has seriously prejudiced any chance he may have had of reducing the Khamseh tribes to relative obedience in the near future. At the end of August Muhammad Khan, Kashkuli, arrived at Shiraz. His presence was urgently needed to set the expeditionary force in motion! He had been delayed by quarrels with Muhammad Ali Khan. On 2nd Septem ber, the Government force, consisting mainly of Kashgais, with a few sarbaz local sowars and one gun, moved out of town. About the same date Sowlet- ed-DowJeh appeared in person at Darangan. I doubt whether the full Gov ernment force numbered more than 600 men, and it varied considerably, manv of the tribesmen coming and going according to the requirements of their private affairs. The army never got beyond Chenar Rahdar, developments in the north suddenly transferring the centre of interest from Siakh to Baiza. The llkhani had been collecting a force and was moving southwards Sowlet-es-Saltaneh, SowIet-ed-Dowleh’s full brother, a weak, vacillating character, had in the spring, after many hesitations, thrown in his lot with Sardar Ihtishamand been appointed Ilbegi. His loyalty was, however, dubious and he was known to be ambitious of becoming Ilkhani. At the be^innin^ of September the Ilkhani discovered that Sowlet-es-Saltaneh was plotting to bnno* down some of the tribes to join Sowiet-ed-Dowleh. Salar HishmeL the IlkhanTs full brother, attacked and utterly defeated S miet-es-Saltaneh near Asepas. Sowlet-es-Saltaneh escaped with the utmost difficulty to Baiza where several of the smaller tribes, who had revolted against the exaction of Malivrat gathered, round him. At this juncture, the Ilkhani showed a deplorable lack of decision and energy. Had he marched promptly to Baiza, he could probably have dispersed with little difficulty the insknificant following then round Sowlet-es-Saltaneh. Instead of taking such prompt action, he advanced in a very dilatory manner, giying Muhammad Ali Khan, who had moved from Ardekan, time to join Sow let-es-Saltaneh. Negotiations for peace ensued, Muhammad All Khan all the while pretending to be neutral and actuated by the amiable desire of effecting a general reconciliation. It soon became evident however, that Muhammad Ah Khan, with the help of Haji Muhammad’ Karim Khan, the arch-misch.ef-maker among the Kashgais was plotUn“ the ruin of Sardar Ihtisham. He and several lesser chiefs around Soedet-es'’- Saltaneh telegraphed to the Persian Government and Mukhber-es-S iltaneh that they were dissatisfied with Sardar Ihtisham. They asserted that they in no way supported Sowlet-ed-Howleh and that they desired the appoiutnienT of Ah Kh ' f I^ hani ; In 'egotiating with Sardar Ihtisham, Muham- mad Ah Khan insisted strongly on the release of Ayyaz Kiha, and at last the Ilkham weakly consented. This concession was fatal. The Kashgais saw that Muhammad Ah Khan was master of the situation, and tW began to desert to Sowlet-es-Sa aneh. Negotiations continued for some time/and Muhammad Khan, leaving the Government army at Chenar Rahdar, proceeded to“a to support the Ilkham At the request of Muhammad All Khan and SowTet es-Saltaneh, Kawam-ul-Mulk despatched Mudabber-es-Saltaneh the Demits Governor, to Baiza to assist in effectino&gt; n +• n L t - L,e P u ty by Musteshir-ul-Mulk, a reg^tered^rftiAh^u^ect^rrho Secretary to former flkhanis They d d nni- 1 .n n d ^ aCted as arbitrarily appropnated by Sowlet-ed-Dowleh, sent him ,luzabad - lo ' 1 ' fort near Firuzabad.

These hopes were inevitably disappointed through the incapacity of Sowlet-es-Saltaneh. A meeting took place between him, Sowlet-ed-Dowlel, and Muhammad Ali Khan near Khan £ Zinian, with the result that Sowlet-es-Saltaneh agreed to accompany h s brother to Jirreh. Muhammad Ali Khan and Muhammad Khan pitched up a reconciliation oue wit, another, and both proceeded to Shnpur. Sowlet-es- hii wn S P ? m Char '!

Ali Penali Kilia and Samsam- es-Sultan sulTeicd considerably, for their possessions were plundered bv Ayyaz Kiha. Zeki Khan, the larsimadani kalantar, has been dismissed by Sowlet-es- Saltaneh or Sowlet-ed-Dowleh and has gone to Kamarii with his immediate retainers. Masih Khan, the other Karsimadani kalantar, and two of the lesser Kashkuli Khans went with Sardar Ihtisham to meet the Governor-General at rersepolis. £ ,, Th f. ^ te 1 n . esa of 1 the season was P artl y responsible for the hurried departure ot the disturbing elements from the vicinity of the town. Also no doubt Sowlet-ed-Dowleh, Sowlet-es-Saltaneh and Muhammad Ali Khan were anxious not to remain in the vicinity of the town on the arrival of Mukhber- es-Saltaneh. A refusal on their part, when they were so close to Shiraz to come into town and pay their respects to the Governor-General would have savoured too strongly of revolt. The news of Sardar Ihtisham’s retirement and lack of funds caused the break up of the Government army at Chenar Kahdar. The famous expedi tionary force, after absorbing the greater part of 20,000 tomans, melted away without having done anything effective. J The state of the Shiraz valley after Hassan Khan’s advance to Siakh at the end of July grew more and more unsatisfactory. The tribal ritiemen, Kashgai and Khamsek, summoned to form the expeditionary army, were more* baneful to the Shiraz valley than the marauders they had come to repel. They robbed freely in and around the city, and their chiefs seemed to have little control over them. Kawam-ul-Mulk’s restraining influence grew weaker and weaker. There were several daring assaults on Europeans, for whom the tribesmen had evidently lost their respect. But for the personally friendly dispositions of the tribal chiefs in the town towards the Consulate, we might not have got through the tribal migration without more serious incidents. °As it was, from the beginning of September I had to warn British subjects not to remain abroad after sunset. The raids of Hassan Khan’s men from Siakh resulted in the interruption of the snow supply of the town at the very hottest period of the year and rendered it dangerous for Europeans or townsmen to circulate at any distance from the city. This state of affairs continued until the tribes had passed Shiraz. As the Koshgais moved southward, the Sarhad route, which had been safe all the summer, was naturally closed. Several large caravans came down in the wake of the Governor-General and the squadron of the Central India Horse withdrawn from Ispahan to Shiraz. Otherwise caravan traffic with Ispahan has been practically suspended since the middle of September. !Since the end of July, blocks on the Bushire road have been even more frequent than before, partly owing to the closing of the CSienar Rahdar-Khan- i-Zinian stage after the occupation of Siakh by Hassan Khan, partly owinst to chronic hostilities lower down the road, between Ali Muhammad, Kamariji, one of the ringleaders of the attacks on our troops, who is still in possession of Rahdar, and the Kazerunis helped by their allies of Kamarij, as well as between the Kamarijis, supported by Shabancara, and the adherents of Nur Muhammad Khan of Daliki under the command of his brother Hussein Be', who is in possession of Konar Takhteh. Hussein Beg, profiting by thedtatu * Enclosure to serial No. 44 . of Khurshid Khan reported in my tel,- gram* No. Ill of 16th July last, seized Cherum, a village belonging to Kamarij and lying on the road between Kamarij and Konar Takhteh. The 70,000 cartridges consigned to the Ears t Enclosure 1 to 3 ™! No. 81. Government and seized by Hussein Beg (see my telegramf No. 141 of *s3rd August last) must have been very useful during the hostilities around Cherum. However, the Kamarijis succeeded in re-occupying Oherum, and peace has, at any rate temporarily, been made between the two contending parties. The extortionate exactions of headmen and road-guards from caravans have shown no signs of diminution, and the rates of transport are as exorbitant as ever. After the retirement of Sirdar Ihtisham, the road remained practically closed for several weeks, no one being responsible for its protection. The districts, on the importance of which for Shiraz trade I laid stress in t Enclosure 1 to Serial No. 49. my despatch, J No. 10, of 15th July last, . have remained closed. South-Eastern Ears, the most important outlet for merchandise imported to Shiraz, is, owin' to the interruption of communications with Shiraz, being now laro&gt;ely supplied from Bandar Abbas. As a result of this state of affairs, the present year has been the worst on record for Shiraz merchants, who have been unable to clear the goods brought up from Bushire at phenomenal rates of transport. The Director of the Indo-European Telegraph Department has no doubt kept you informed of the frequent interruptions to the telegraph wires. These interruptions and the assaults on, and robberies of, repairing parties, have been far more frequent than in previous years, though the usual autumnal total interruption of the southern wires was less prolonged than in the last two years. The events of the last six months have resulted in a considerable deterio- ration ol the situation generally in Ears. The waning authoritv of the Gov ernment has been almost entirely broken up. Even more serious has been the dissolution of tribal authority. The control of the Chiefs over their tribes men has become largely ineffectual as a restraining influence. The Khamseh tribesmen, with possibly the exception of a part of the Shaybani Arabs under Asker and Muhammad Kuli Khan, are completely out of the control of their kalantars. The Kashgais, always more submissive than the Khaoikh srill respond to a limited extent to the restrictions of their kalantars, butare tend mg to become more and more insubordinate. The kalantars have created for themselves a position of independence against which no Ilkhani, under present conditions, can successfully assert himself. pmsent The main cause of the successful insubordination of the Khamseh and Kashgai tribes has of course been the rivalry between the Kawami familv and Sowlet-ed-Dowleh. This rivalry has enabled the kalantars of tlie Khamseh nf “S? 1 /K nb T 8 !^? thernselv es practically independent of Kawam- ul-Mulk and the Ilkhani respectively : it has indirectly led to the insubordi nate attitude of the tribesmen towards the kalantars themselves. To enable the kalantars to regain control over their tribesmen, or to enable Kawam-ul-Mulk and an Ilkhani to re-assert their authority over the Khamseh and Kashgai tribes, a settlement of the strife between the Kawami family and Sowlet-fd- Dowieh would seem essential. In 1910, when the Government still had considerable authority left, a solution would not have been difficult. Now the Government’s au hority is well nigh gone and cannot count as an important factor in the resolution of this vital problem of Ears. 1A 141 Sardar Ihtisham, by force of circumstances and by his own incapacity, has failed to impose his authority on the Kashorais. It is ‘improbable that Sowlet- ed-Dowleh can be more succesful as long as he has to contend against the Kawami influence among the Kashgai and Khamseh tribes. It is equally improbable that Kawam-ul-Mulk can ever impose his authority on the Khamseh tribes as long as he is distrac f ed by the opposition of Sowlet-ed-Dowleh. The Government is at present too weak to annihilate either the Kawami power or Sowh*t-ed-Dowleh. Unless, therefore, a reconciliation and an alliance can he brought about between these two rival powers, the affairs of Fars are likely to remain in a hopeless impasse. Such an alliance, with Government support, might possibly lead to a gradual reduction of the insubordinate Khamseh and Kashgai tribes. Efforts are being made to effect such a reconciliation, which some persons believe, for several reasons, to be easier to-day than at any previous time. Firstly, they reason, Sowlet-ed-Dowleh has been humbled and must have realised his limitations. Secondly, it is said that the Bakhtiaris are now animated with less hostile sentiments towards Sowlet-ed-Dowleh. A minor Bakhtiari Khan, Abbas Kuli Khan, came to Shiraz in September with a view to negotiating a marriage between Murteza Kuli Khan, son of Samsam-es- Saltaneh, and a sister of Sowlet-ed-Dowleh. In 1910, this same Murteza Kuli Khan married Sardar Ihtisham’s sister, who died last year. In the present case, the negotiations, which were cpnducted with Sowlet-es*Saltaneh, may possibly have been intended to detach that Chief from Sowlet-ed-Dowleh. Anyhow, they do not appear to have led to any definite understanding. Thirdly, it is argued that the sudden death, on the 21st instant, of Lika-ed- Dowleh, the wife of Kawam-ul-Mulk, is likely to facilitate at reconciliation. This woman, a Kashgai and aunt of Sowlet-ed-Dowleh, was a remarkable personality, possessing great influence over her husband and many powerful elements in the province. Her death provoked quite an extraordinary demonstration in Shiraz, all the bazaars closing for one day in sign of mourning. Of mutable connections in her sexual life, she was yet devoted to her husband’s interests. She acted as his bailiff and political adviser, and even fought for him. in the summer of 1911, with her brother-in-law murdered and her husband in refuge at the Consulate, she succeeded in bringing the Khamseh tribesmen into town, and by the energy of her direction caused the defeat of Nizam-es-Saltaneh and Sowlet-ed-Dowleh. She is said, during the hostilities in the towm, to have gone to the barricades and used a rifle as competently as any of the fighting men. Her restless, uncompromising spirit often stiffened her husband,°and it is thought that the removal of her influence may facilitate negotiations for peace. It is even suggested that, Lika-ed-Dowdeh being dead, it mio'ht be possible to arrange a marriage between Kawam-ul-Mulk and Sowlet-ed-Dowleh’s sister. Fourthly, it is hoped that the lassitude resulting from long, ineffectual strife may dispose both parties to peace. I am inclined to think that those who hope for this happy consummation overlook the most important factor in this problem. Everything is quickly forgotten in Persia, and it is possible that Kawam-ul-Mulk may overlook the years of bitter rivalry, the treacherous murder of his brother, his own narrow escape from a similar fate, but the material loss he has suffered, and is suffering, from Sowlet-ed-Dowleh’s rapacity is a far more serious matter. Machiavelli’s remark that “ men forget more quickly the death of their father than the loss of their patrimony” is true at any rate as regards Persia. Unless some means can be devised to deter Sowlet-ed-Dowleh from plundering and appropriating the properties of Kawam-ul-Mulk and other Fars land- owners I fail to see how any real reconciliation can be effected. And Sowlet- ed-Dowleh is peculiarly shortsighted when his avarice comes into play. Time after time he has sacrificed his political interests to his insatiate greed. More over I confess that I am sceptical as to whether Sowlet-ed-Dowleh’s mis fortunes will have taught him wisdom. He is peculiarly untrustworthy, even for a Persian, and he has little political sagacity. I doubt whether the Gov ernment could ever be assured of his co-operation, even if his legitimate interests were protected.142 The Persian Government cannot now, in my opinion, count on a restora tion of order through the reconciliation of Kawam-ul-Mulk with Sowlet-ed- Dowleh. Even if such a reconciliation were effected, the Government would still require a strong, efficient regular force to support these two magnates in j reducing their insubordinate tribesmen. If a reconciliation is found impractic able, the Government may be compelled in the end to make an attempt to remove Kawam-ul-Mulk from Ears, to abolish the llkhaniship of the Kashgai tribes and to deal direct with the kalantars. In that eventuality a larger force would be required. However, with or without the assistance of a combination of the mrst powerful tribal leaders in Ears, the Persian Government cannot to- .dav hope for a restoration of order without the support of a regular army of considerable strength. The old policy of using tribe against tribe is played out. The tribes have at last realised the folly, in their own interests, of fighting each other pour le roi de Prusse. In conclusion, I would lay stress on one special question, which, neverthe less, is of the most general import for the administration of Ears. I refer to the prosecution of the ringleaders of the attacks on our troops. This question as has already been noted, had a disastrous influence on the situation this summer. It is likely to play a prominent part in future developments. This question concerns us very particularly, but it is of even more concern to the Persian Government in its bearing on the internal administration of the province. No Governor can hope to impose his authority satisfactorily on the province, no Ilkbani can hope to re-establish his authority over the Kashgais, until the tribe which attacked in pitched battle the regular troops of the Power hitherto most feared in Ears has been called to account.

He asks if you will kindly use your good offices with Governor to prevent obstruction and have men sent up. On 14th November, Resident replied as follows: information available here differs from that given by Major Siefvert. The person to whom Darya Begi wired was his former farrashbashi, Mahmud, who showed telegram to Governor in presence of my Mirza, and had latter’s permission to do what he could. He is stated to have obtained 40 men, and is endeavouring to obtain funds from Darya Begi for their despatch to Shiraz. As there is ill- feeling of longstanding between Darya Begi and Governor, latter would be more amenable to direct message from Governor-General than to message through me which would be attributed to Darya Begi. Since above, Governor informs me he has received telegram from Governor-General asking for assistance in recruiting for Gendarmerie.

It will be seen that there is every prospect of an acute feud develop ing between the two sections of the Kashkuli Kashgais, and that this feud is likely to involve Muhammad Ali Khan in hostilities with an important sec tion of his own tribe, who wish to see him deposed or even obliterated I will not attempt at this stage to forecast the possible effect of this development upon the political situation, which seems again to be as unsatis factory as ever, now that the momentary detente caused by the Governor- GeneraFs arrival has lost its novelty.

I am forwarding a copy of this communication to His Majesty’s Minister. Note. Shortly after my arrival at Deh Kuhneh, the principal village of Sliaban- cara, where I was most hospitably and cordially entertained by Muhammad Ali Khan of Shabancara, an old friend, it was announced that Muhammad Khan, Kashkuli, and Ardeshir Khan were coming in from the mountains to pay a visit to the Shabancara Khans. This Muhammad Khan, Kashkuli, is at the head of one-half of the Kashkuli clan, the other half following Muhammad Ali Khan, Kashkuli, his cousin. Muhammad Khan is the eldest son of the late Muhammad Hassan Beg, who died in the winter of 1910-11, and for many years before his father’s death there was hitter enmity between them and Sowlet-ed-Dowleh on the one hand, and Muhammad All Khan’s section on the other. A younger brother of Muhammad Ali Khan had been killed in the inter-Kashgai conflictU8 of 1906, fighting on behalf of Sowlet-ed-Dowleb, while Muhammad Khan and his section were on the opposite side. It was only because of Muhammad Ali Khan’s temporary estrangement from Sowlet-ed-Dowleh in 1911-12 that there was a reconciliation between the two sections of the Kashkulis. This autumn there has been a quarrel between the two cousins and a split between the factions, on the one side being grouped Muhammad Khan and his brothers, his cousin Ghulam Hussein Khan, and Isfandiar and Ardeshir Klian, two younger cousins of another branch : while with Muhammad Ali Khan and his brother are Haji Muhammad Kerim Khan and his brother, and Ibrahim Khan. In reply to my questions, my host told me quite frankly that the reason for Muhammad Khan coming down to the plains at this juncture w r as-to canvass the support of Ismaii Khan of Shabancara and Zira against Muhammad Ali Klian, in an approaching campaign; both of these Kasbkuli Chiefs desired supremacy in the clan, and Muhammad Khan was now thirsting for blood. Later, Muhammad Khan unburdened himself in my tent, and biassed though it may be, his story is important evidence against Muhammad Ali Khan. , After telling me that Muhammad AJi Khan had become an enemy of his, he said that one of the chief grievances against himself by Muhammad Ali Khan was on account of the attack on the British force near Kazerun, and the surrender of those guilty. Muhammad Ali Khan, being alarmed at the idea of the British Government taking action, had been pressing him to a^ree to join him (Muhammad Ali Khan) in resistance, if pursued. f:. : t P Last year, Major Birdwood on arrival at Kazerun had asked ^ 'two men to accompany him to the caravanserai. Muhammad Khan, Kahskuli, then in Kazerun, had sent four. At the caravanserai, while the British party w r ere halted, Muhammad Ali Khan’s men in the caravanserai told Muhammad Khan’s four men that they were going to attack the British. Muhammad Khan’s men objected, saying that they were responsible to their Khan for the safe escort of Mr. Smart and his party, and that Muhammad Khan’s permission would first have to be obtained. Muhammad Ali Khan s men would not wait, and in the running fight which followed one of Muhammad Khan’s men w r as, so he declared, wounded in amongst the British troops. As to the booty, saddles, equipment, cartridges, &amp;c., all w T ent to Muhammad Ali Khan’s tents. ^ eas ^ -^ u ^ iamma fi Ali Khan might have done, was to have consulted him, Muhammad Khan, before making the attack: he would either have u ° V ^ de arran g e ments in concert. “As it is,” he continued, Muhammad Ah Khan is solely responsible and srot all the bootv : now, with- 0 , U L r !? I f e .° r reas ° n ’ be cJaims that I ’ Muhammad Khan, should support him it British troops take action against him. The Zeisham and Kawam had pressed him so hard for the delivery of the culprits that he has taken flight. He cannot give the culprits up, as he himself was responsible. ” I remarked that the culprits are w 7 ell-known. Muhammad Khan then gave the following names :— .

Could there have been anything more, said Muhammad attack on a British Consul in such a manner ? He then asked why we were doing nothing. Khan, than an rHe supposed that the British Government thought it would cost them 60 lives and 50,000 tomans to exact the necessary retribution with their own men, and that was why they were taking no action. But, let the British Government give him 7,000 cartridges and with 20 men only he would capture Muhammad Ali Khan. Once he had crushed Muhammad Ali Khan, the culprits, having lost their protector, would have no where to turn. The Kalantars of K^azerun and Kumarij, part of Mammasenni, and the Khans of Shabancara were all friends of Muhammad Khan. Anvhow, whether the British Government pursued the matter or not, he, Muhammad Khan, was going to sit still no longer. Muhammad Ali Khan had begun to “ think himself a man He was going to attack Muhammad Ali Khan once and for all very shortly. Discounting the bravado and exaggerations of this statement, it seems certain that there will be hostilities among the Kashkulis very shortly. Muhammad Khan was busy during the whole of his visit buying rifles and cartridges. In my presence he sent one man to buy 3,000 cartridges from Budhilleh, other men to purchase several thousand in Borasjun, and he was buying as many as he could locally in Shabancara.

The main focus of discussion is the Gendarmerie (under the command of Swedish officers) and a new local Persian force proposed by the Governor-General. It contains much discussion between British officials over the effectiveness of the Gendarmerie, and the suitability of employing Swedish officers in Persia. There is also discussion over the extent that British support should be provided to the Governor-General's new force, which includes the following: a proposal for the Government of India to supply arms and ammunition, and proposals to appoint a British officer to inspect and advise the new force. There is also consideration over the potential for conflict between the Governor-General's force and the Gendarmerie, and the potential for a negative impact on the latter should a British officer be appointed to the Governor's force.There is also a great deal of discussion related to the position of the 39 Central India Horse (commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel James Archibald Douglas) at Shiraz and additional infantry supplied to guard the British Consulate there; the discussion centres on whether or not these forces should be withdrawn from Persia. Some limited consideration of 'outrages' committed by Persians against British troops is factored into this discussion. It also includes proposals for withdrawing these forces from Persia via Bushire.The principal correspondents are as follows: Sir Walter Beaupre Townley, HM Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Persia; Sir Edward Grey, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; Sir Walter Alexander Smart, HM Consul, Shiraz; and Sir Percy Zachariah Cox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.The following can also be found within:two copies (on folios 84-87 and 185-188) of a review of the general situation in Fars by Sir W A Smart;a note (folios 190-191) from Henry George Chick, Commercial Adviser to the Persian Gulf Political Residency, on a possible split between two sections of the Kashkuli Kashgais;a proposed answer (folios 132-139) for the Secretary of State for India to a proposed question to be asked by Sir John David Rees in the House of Commons on 13 March 1913;a report from Major Kettlewell (folios 109v-111) on the movements of a survey party of the 39th Central India Horse on 11 December 1913, which provides an account of the death of Captain A B Eckford;a commendation for Mr J C Smith, Assistant Superintendent of the Indo-European Telegraph, and staff in Fars (folios 182-191).The French content consists of two programmes for the development of the Gendarmerie submitted by Colonel Hjalmar O Hjalmarson (folios 152-153 and 50-51) dated 29 December 1912 and 13 February 1913 respectively.Each part includes a divider which gives the subject and part numbers, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references contained in that part by year.
