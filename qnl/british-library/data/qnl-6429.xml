General Goldsmid’s original decision respecting the Perso-Belooch Frontier was embodied in a note,* dated OcioKoDcLter t i r 87i. r0m Mla ' l/t September Wl, addressed by Mr Alison, Her Majesty s Minister at Teheran, to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs in the following terms:— The undersigned, Her Britannic Majesty’s Enroy Extraordinary and Minister Pleni potentiary at the Court of Persia, acting on the part of his Government, has the honour to submit, for the approval of His Majesty the Shah, a map in which the boundary line between the territories possessed in Baluchistan by Persia, and the territories forming the exclusive property of the independent State of Kelat, is delineated. This line may be described :—Commencing from the northernmost point, or that which is furthest from the sea, the territory of Kelat is bounded to' the west by the large Persian district of Dizzuk, which is composed of many dehs or minor districts, those on the frontier being Jalk and Kallegan. Below these two last named is the small district of Kohuk, which, together with Punjghur, comprising Parum and other dependencies, is on the Kelat side of the frontier, while on the Persian side is Bampusht. Below Punjghur, the frontier possessions of Kelat to the sea are Boleida, including Zamiran and other dependencies, Mund and Dusht. Within the Persian line of frontier are the villages or tracts belonging to Sirbaz and Bahu Dustyari. The boundary of Dusht is marked by a long line drawn through the Drabol hill, situated between the Rivers Bahu and Dusht, to the sea in the Bay of Gwuttur. To summarize,—Punjghur and Parum, and other dependencies, with Kohuk, Boleida, including Zamiran and other dependencies ; Mund, including Tump, Nasserabad, Kedj, and all districts, dehs, and dependencies to the eastward ; Dusht, with its dependencies as far as the sea. These names exhibit the line of actual possession of Kelat, that is to say, all tracts to the east of the frontier of actual Persian possession, which frontier comprises Dizzuk and Bampusht, Sirbaz and Peshin, Bahu and Dustyari. f Page 300, Letters from India, Oc tober to December 1871. His reasons for thus stated:—+ this decision were Kohuk must be considered, however, as well as Punjghur, among those parts of Kelat territory which Persia has not made her own. Inquiries made in 1863, and since that period, led me invariably to this conclusion, and the hereditary Chief of Kohuk was with Major Harrison’s camp this year at Bampur, waiting to give his evidence. I need not repeat here the particulars of Mirza Maasum Khan’s refusal to discuss this question. Ibrahim Khan had set up an opposition Chief, but the Persians would not confront him with the other. I examined the latter at Gwadur, and tested his deposition taken before Major Harrison, of which the following is an extract,— _ « Though I have never paid revenue, I have always considered myself a subject of His « Hio-hness the Khan of Kelat, and bound to give feudal service. I have no wish whatever “ to Ibe a Persian subject. My tithes as Sirdar are five maunds of jowaree and barley, « 24 seers of ghee, and 15 maunds of dates. Kunabusta, close to Kohuk, belongs to me. « My nephew, Isfunda Khan, son of Jehangir, is the Chief of Isfunda. He has the revenue. « Jafunda is under the Kelat Government, and has never acknowledged Persia.” On the other hand, Captain Lovett heard, when in Parum, that Kohuk had always been an integral portion of the Dizzuk District, and was subject to Bampur when in the hands of the Nourshirwanis, and never at any time paid tribute to or acknowledged the Khan of Kelat. A day later he wrote, “ One old man affirmed that Mir Morad, of Kohuk, had hitherto paid a camel yearly to the Shah’s Government as a nominal mark of fealty.” From the incidental mention of a name in an old Native report, I have reason to believe that Mir Morad was seized, while fighting against the Persians in 1854, and earned away to Bampur, and such seizure may not improbably have led to forcible dispossession, or acknow ledgement of a new sovereignty. But against this assumption, and Captain Lovett s hearsay evidence, we have the recent statement of Mir Morad himself, the hereditary :Nourshirwam Chief of Kohuk,—quoted, moreover, as Chief by Captain Lovett s informant, an t is ap pears to me to have the greater weight, especially when, as regards Kohuk and dependencies, Mirza Maasum Khan declined to enter upon any investigation of possession or rights what ever. 17358.2 From the first the point of contention, as regards the Shah of Persia, has been the district of Kohuk. His Majesty was willing to accept Sir F. Goldsmid’s decision m all other * Page 1,216, Letters from Persia, 1871. t Page 326, Letters from India, October to December 1871. respects,* hut the “ small tract” in ques tion was much coveted hy the Shah, who was anxious that a “ little alteration * should he made in regard thereto. Mirza Saeed, The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, indeed, plainly said t to Sir F. Goldsmid that the Persian Govern ment only asked for a slight concession, which “ to a Sovereign like that ol te Persia could hardly he refused ; that the General had it in his power o “ do all that was required, and that he certainly could not hesitate to do “ it; that His Majesty had now abandoned much to meet the wishes ot “ Her Majesty’s Government, together with many similar allusions to the “ request communicated on the previous evening that Kohuk might e ** included within Persian territory.” To all these protestations Sir x. Goldsmid repeated his regret “ at being powerless in the matter. . . . “ From first to last he had consistently maintained one particular frontier “ as that of possession on either side, and that it was not in his power to “ give away this or that tract at pleasure.” After much discussion Mr. Alison’s Note was ultimately accepted by the Persian Government in the following terms : ^ _ x „ . T ,. r T Letter from Mirza Saeed Khan to Oc to hereto Deo’cmberYsT i ’ Mr. Alison, dated 4th September 18714 Your Excellency’s letter of the 1st instant, together with the map of General Goldsmid, the British Commissioner, respecting the frontier line between the Persian possessions and dependencies in Baluchistan and the Baluchistan dependencies made over to the indepen dent State of Kelat, have been received and have both been submitted to His Majesty the In obedience to His Majesty’s orders, I beg, in reply, most respectfully to state that the Persian Government, notwithstanding the clear right which it considered itself to have over Baluchistan, simply out of regard for the wishes of Her Britannic Majesty’s Government, that this question should be brought to a satisfactory conclusion by the definition of a boundary line, has hereby accepted your Excellency’s letter and the map. The Persian Government now looks forward to the desirable results and important advantages which it expects from the British Government for this great act of compliance and co-operation on the part of Persia, and awaits to see what will emanate from the suitable manner in which the matter will be represented through the good offices of your Excellency, an experienced Minister and a well-wisher, perfectly cognizant of the whole details of the merits of the question. The same day (4th September 1871), however, Mirza Saeed ad- 8 Page 619, Letters from India, October to dressed a further note§ to Mr. December 1871. Alison: — Your Excellency’s letter has been received, with General Goldsmid’s map, delineating the frontier line in Beloochistan. - # The reply is contained in a separate letter, which accompanies this, and is also dated this day, and Your Excellency will see the same. But, in accordance with His Majesty’s com mand and desire, I consider it my duty to trouble Your Excellency with this statement, that the Persian Government, on the authority of the correspondence which has been forwarded from this Department to the Legation, from the beginning of the present discussion, and the verbal communications which have also taken place, considered itself entitled to distinct and manifest rights over most of the tracts of Baluchistan, and even over Kedj, Gwadur, &amp;c., but in the last discussion, which took place in the presence of General Goldsmid merely to facilitate matters, the Persian Government contented itself with requesting that a small portion of Persian Baluchistan, which on the map has been included in the Kelat terri tory, such as Kohuk, Isfunda, and Kunabusta, which are not large or important places, should, for certain reasons, be made over to Persia. General Goldsmid having excused himself on the plea that he was not authorised to entertain such a discussion on the part of his Government, the Persian Government has therefore referred this question to its own representative in London, who is to discuss this subject with the British Ministers, and ask for a settlement which may be in unison with justice and friendship. The Persian Ministers, considering the high opinion they have ot the British Government, the great value they attach to its sense of justice and to the important results of its friend ship, as also the friendly disposition of Your Excellency, are in hopes that this simple request, which is so heartily desired by His Majesty, and which has not been granted here, may no longer be a source of disappointment to them, who have exhibited perfect co-operation and compliance (with the wishes of England).3 * Page 584, Letters from India, July to December 1872. t Page 584, Letters from India, July to December 1872. The Khan of Kelat also subsequently accepted the above decision in the following terms“ ... I therefore send a formal agree- “ ment sealed. In future I will also agree to anything that you may “ consider advantageous to me.”* Some further correspondencef took place with the Khan, arising out of the wording of the Political Agent’s first letter asking His Highness to agree to the line of boundary, hut the answer was invariably, “ The British Government are at liberty to do whatsoever they may think advisable.” Beverting to the events of the previous year (1871), the Persian t Letters from Foreign Office, 13th Ambassador ill this country brought to November 1871. the notice of the Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs t the wish of His Majesty the Shah for a modification in the line of frontier as laid down in Sir F.

I hope that Your Excellency will sympathize fully with the views of His Imperial Majesty, and that you will appreciate the justice of his request, which has no further object than to put an end, in a clear and decided manner, to a state of things which cannot but be a source of difficulty and perpetual disorder. Your Excellency will allow me not to withhold from you that, in more than one instance, the Government of His Imperial Majesty has, in certain points, met with an inflexibility on the part of the Indian Government, seemingly but little in accordance with the desire to be in harmony with a friendly Government, &amp;c., &amp;c. Upon the receipt of these representations from the Persian Ambas sador, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs requested^' an ex pression of opinion on the part of the Duke of Argyll, as to the answer which should be returned to the Persian Letter from Foreign Office, 13th November 1871. Minister’s communication. These papers having been circulated in the usual manner. Sir H. Eaw- ** See Letter to Foreign Office, 28th linson recorded therein the following November 1871. Memorandum:—** On referring to Captain Lovett’s map of the new Perso-Baluch frontier, the claim of Persia to the district of Kohuk would seem to be geographically valid, for the district in question, as the boundary is now coloured, appears like a half-detached peninsula intruding into Persian territory. Politically also, Sir F. Goldsmid seems to have had serious doubts as to which power the district ought to belong, and ultimately, as far as I can judge, he allowed the claim of Persia to lapse by default. Under such circumstances, the protest now sent in by the Persian Minister in London, may, I think, be in so far entertained that the case be sent out for the consideration of the Government of India, and, in the meantime, an assurance may be given that, in the event of its being judged expedient to embody the late arrangement concluded at Tehran, in a formal convention, due attention will be paid to the argument contained in his Excellency’s memo randum, with a view to the rectification of any errors that may be found, on further examina tion, to attach to the proposed line of delimitation. Captain St. John should then be directed to pay particular attention to the disputed dis trict of Kohuk in his contemplated survey of the frontier, collecting on the spot all available evidence with regard to the past and present dependency of the contested villages, and ascer taining the wishes of the inhabitants in respect to their future allegiance. I cannot believe that the acquisition of these insignificant villages, with a few square miles of surrounding desert, can be a matter of real political importance either to the Persian or Kelat Governments. The question at issue is rather one of honour than of substantial value, and in that view it would be, I think, to our advantage if, without violating justice or giving real cause for offence to the Khan of Kelat, we could confer an obligation upon the Shah of Persia by modi fying the Mekran frontier arrangement in his favour.4 The India Office replied* that ^question wouldbe_ referred to the v ^r OTeign0 ^ 28thN0 - of a formal Convention ^ thl SuSs LnCtlTn the papers submitted by His Excellency.

That my own suggestion was in favour of a different procedure, to attain a similar end, can be readily explained. I believed that a concession to Persia, which really took nothing from Kelat, and admitted the truth of the Persian argument on behalf of a good geographical boundary line, would have facilitated a satisfactory settlement of the whole case, and have met the wishes on the subject of Her Majesty’s Government of India. , „ ^ , Sir H. Rawlinson’s views on the ]g | P-245, Secret Despatches tolnd.a, ^ be gathered from the fol . lowing Memorandum :—f I doubt the possibility of maintaining the district of Kohuk in a practically independent position. If the Kelat frontier be drawn to the east of it, it will virtually lapse to Persia, for Ibrahim Khan will be constantly exerting a pressure which there will be no means of resisting, and Kohuk will thus be crushed out, without Kelat or the British Government having an opportunity of remonstrance. This result, whatever might be its local effect, would be discreditable to us, after we had been at so much pains to prevent it. I think, therefore, we had better make a virtue of necessity, and consider a geographical frontier only, which, as Major St. John has abundantly shown, must, as far as Kelat is concerned, pass to the east of Kohuk. I don’t see that we should be sacrificing any real political rights by this arrangement, for what possible claim could a petty frontier Chief possess to national inde pendence ? and we should, at any rate, benefit to the extent of placing Persia under a certain obligation to us. To preserve Kohuk as a neutral territory we must guarantee it against the interference of its two powerful neighbours, and this, I presume, is going further than we contemplate. After careful consideration of the question, a Despatch! was addressed J Secret Despatch to India, No. 2, dated 28th March 1873. to the Government of India, of which the following are the important para graphs :— 2. The proposal to draw two lines of frontier, one east of Kohuk, for Kelat, and one west, for Persia, would appear to pledge Her Majesty’s Government indirectly to the main tenance of an independent State where independence would be neither necessary nor expedient. Her Majesty’s Government would prefer, therefore, to draw the line east of Kohuk as the boundary of Kelat, making no specification of the actual boundary of Persia to the westward at all. This arrangement would seem to meet the political as well as geo graphical requirements of the case, without committing Her Majesty’s Government to any inconvenient responsibility. The Chief of Kohuk can possess no claim to be declared inde pendent, and Major St. John’s recent inquiries have confirmed the truth of the supposition that, so far as Kelat is concerned, the geographical frontier must pass to the eastward of his territory. 3. I learn, moreover, that, among the disputed frontier districts, two only were practically exempted from payment of tribute to any superior power. These were Mund and Kohuk. The former was adjudged to Kelat, and remains still within the boundary of that State. It is probably the only district which has shown signs of disquiet, and a tendency to raid across the recognized Perso-Kelat frontier during the year succeeding the exchange of not*s at Tehran. These movements doubtless provoke retaliation, and lead to serious violation of boundary, and the districts whence they arise thus become a thorn in the side of sove reign authority. Were Kohuk in quasi allegiance to Kelat, it might not unnaturally follow the° example of Mund, and thus throw a responsibility on the Khan which he is little able to bear. In such circumstances, His Highness would be practically stronger without the district than with it. „ . , . , 4 The barren tracts of Gurh and Segzi, will, however, for convenience and compactness of frontier, be included with the Punjghur District of Kelat, as shown in Major St. John s 5 That there should be no misapprehension on either side as to the precise terms of the settlement, copy of the modified note^which has been forwarded to the Foreign Office for transmission to Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, in substitution of that dated the 1st September 1871, is herewith enclosed. A map is under preparation, and will shortly observe that, in September last, instructions were given to inform the Khan of Kelat that his boundary had not been finally settled. He is now therefore awaiting the decision of Her Majesty’s Government, and this should be communicated to His Highness without loss of time. 17358. B6 | From Foreign Office, 12th January 1872. To ditto, loth January 1872. From ditto, 30th January 1872. To ditto, 28th February 1872. This was done, hut the Khan of Kelat protested in the following * Enclosure 9, Secret Letter from terms : * India, No. 51, dated 4th August 1874. Your friendly letter, informing me of your welfare, and forwarding several letters regarding the boundary between Persia and my country, as also a map of the same, reached me at a good time, and I understand all that was written in a friendly spirit. I request that you Alijah will write to the Commissioner in Sind as follows on my account,— 1 hat the boundary is not the same as in my grandfather’s time, Meer Nusseer Khan. Moreover, a great deal has been taken possession of by the Persians, ihe boundary shown in the map only shows lands now in my possession. The British Government are a powerful sove reignty. I look upon myself as obedient to them, and therefore hoped that if the Govern ment above named put their hand to this business they would, of course, have recovered lands in possession of my grandfather from the Persians and restored the same to me. From the present decision of boundary a great deal ot my country has been entered within Persian border. Your Government should know this. By God’s blessing, all is well here. Whereupon, with the concurrence of the Government of India, the Political Superintendent, Upper Sind, f Enclosure 9, as above. Prontier, was directed*)* “ to inform “ His Highness the Khan of Kelat that the boundary line, as shown “on the map, was agreed to and fixed by Her Majesty’s Govern- “ ment after much careful inquiry and full consideration of all existing “ circumstances.” Nothing further on this point appears in the records. While this correspondence was being carried on, the Persian Minister in this country was repeatedly pressing the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs J as to the decision of Her Ma jesty’s Government relative to Kohuk. The matter having been referred to the Government of India, the question could not be further considered till the receipt of their views thereon. So matters, as far as this country is concerned, had remained in abeyance . T ™ | till the commencement of 1873, when an i 8 ^ 3 e amended note,§ embodying the deci- M sion contained in the above-mentioned Sid &amp;jp h', Despatch to the Government of India, was forwarded to the Foreign Office, with a suggestion that, “should Earl Granville concur,” it might be sent to Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, in substitution of that dated 1st September 1871. Lord Granville expressed his concurrence || in the terms of the letter addressed to the Indian Government, and stated that he would instruct Mr. Thomson (at Tehran) accordingly, as soon as the map was ready in which the boundary was laid down. These instructions were subsequently sent,If in April of the same year, and a copy of the Duke of Argyll’s Despatch forwarded for guid ance, as also a copy of the revised note, which it was requested might be “ substituted for that signed “ and sealed by the late Mr. Alison and the Persian Minister for “ Foreign Affairs, on the 1st September 1871,” Mr. Thomson being at the same time directed “ to express the hope of Her Majesty’s Govern- “ ment, that this decision will be considered satisfactory by the Persian “ Government.” A copy of this same note** was also placed by Earl Granville in the hands of the Persian Charge dAffaires at this Court. || Letter from Foreign Office, 24th March 1873. If From Foreign Office, 26th April 1873. ** Letter from Foreign Office, 26th April 1873.7 Mr. Thomson duly presented the revised note* to the Minister for * Letters from Persia, 1873, page Foreign Affairs, expressing a hope that 781 et seq. ° the Council of State would ratify the n i tr- • ^ j i • same &gt; but this they were forbidden by ^ Grand Vmer to do, it being considered necessary to await the return of the Shah to Tehran. f Letter from Foreign Office, 4th S( ^h e -matter rested till 1874, when February 1874. Minister at Tehran telegraphed to Earl Granville as follows :—f In consequence of difficulty created by late Minister for Foreign Affairs before leaving office, Council of State have declined to recommend the Shah to accept your Lordship’s amended note defining Perso-Kelat frontier. Though I assume that no change can be made in your Lordship s decision, at urgent request of the Ex-Grand Vizier, I beg to be informed whether my assumption is correct. Persian Government are apprehensive that, under above decision, Kohuk micffit fall into the hands of Afghanistan, and are therefore desirous either that Kohuk be acknowledged as belonging to Persia, or that no mention in the note be made of places on Persian frontier of course, with the view of retaining or taking possession of it. X Letter to Foreign Office, 16th .. The Argyll, after COnsulta- . February 1874. tion with bir F. Goldsmid, replied in these terms :—{ With reference to your letter of the 4th instant, respecting Kohuk (Perso-Kelat boundary), I am directed by the Duke of Argyll to state, for ttie information of Earl Granville, that the original settlement accepted by Persia took that district out of her hands, but, in consideration of certain circumstances of the case, the counter claim of Kelat to this small territory was not insisted on, her line of frontier being drawn on its eastern side. If this state of things were clearly explained to the Persian Foreign Minister, he would probably see no reason for seeking to change a decision which Her Majesty’s Government cannot consent to set aside. As regards the names of places alluded to in the conclusion of Mr. Thomson’s telegram accompanying your letter under reply, they are essential to the identification and maintenance of the frontier. § In the meanwhile, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed s T .. f ^ no , the following letter to Her Maiesty’s § Letter from Foreign Office, 23rd nr* • x V * e ’ Minister at Tehran, under date 21st April 1874.

Notwithstanding the ancient and full rights of the Persian Government^over Balu chistan, His Majesty, in the earnest desire of giving full effect to the friendly counsel of the British Government, has approved and ratified the said note and map, and I have been honoured by the Royal permission to exchange and accept this new map with its accom panying note for General Goldsmid’s map. My object in thus troubling Your Excellency is to inform you of His Majesty’s Royal assent. Your Excellency will then be empowered to announce this circumstance to Her Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. To this,^f Mr. Thomson replied, on 27th idem, pointing out the mistake under which Mirza Saeed was labouring in stating that Kohuk, &amp;c., were in cluded within Persian territory. Letter from Foreign Office, 23rd April 1874. ****** I have brought this acceptance by His Majesty to the knowledge of Lord Granville, Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and beg that Your Excellency will have the goodness to acquaint me when it will be convenient for you to complete the formality of signature to the note and map in question. I think it necessary, however, to point out to Your Excellency that you are under a mis take in stating that the districts of Kohuk, Isfunda, and Kunabasta have been included by the decision of Her Majesty’s Government, in the map of Persia, and I may remind you that, at the time of presenting the note in question, I pointed out that, as regards those districts, it was the Kelat frontier alone which was laid down in the map.To this latter communication no reply was sent. „ „ . In reporting this correspondence rom oreign ce, ^.j ie g ecre tary of State for Foreign Affairs, Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran stated,—* ♦ See Letter 23rd April 1874. . . . . The ground of objection the latter (the Persian Minister) has taken up is that when the Persian Government accepted the settlement of September 1871, they believed they had ground to expect that, on revision by Her Majesty’s Government of the decision given in respect to the line of frontier, the district of Kohuk would be given to Persia, and that as there were only two claimants for this territory, it having been taken from the one it would naturally fall to the other to receive it; that if allowed to remain uncontrolled it would become a centre of intrigue against Persian Baluchistan; and that the district has been and at this moment is actually in the possession of Persia, and garrisoned by Persian troops. Under these circumstances, His Highness said that he was desirous to make a further representation to Her Majesty’s Government, in the hope that the territory in question would be conceded to Persia, or that in declaring by note the line of frontier of Kelat, which would be most scrupulously respected, the Persian frontier in that quarter would be left undefined. I combated the assertion that Kohuk being left uncontrolled could become a centre of intrigue, hurtful in any way to Persian Baluchistan, separated as it was from Kelat; that the acceptance of the revised note as it stood could not fail to be advantageous to Persia, as it would be regarded by Her Majesty’s Government as a strong proof of friendly deference towards it. I informed him that I could hold out no hope that any change would be made in the settlement last proposed, and begged him to carefully avoid taking any steps which might tend to delay the satisfactory adjustment of the question. The Earl of Derby forwarded all the correspondence to the Marquis of Salisbury, inquiring whether His t r rorn 01 ei o n ce &gt; r Lordship had any observations to offer April 1874. thereon, f The views of Sir F. Goldsmid, who was consulted in the matter, t Letter from Foreign Office, 23rd may be gathered from the following April 1874. extract I need not recapitulate the particulars of the mission on which I was engaged in 1870-71. But I would most respectfully solicit attention to the facts, that everything in his power was done by the Persian Boundary Commissioner to prevent any delineation of frontier being made at all, and that, failing the regular and legitimate course of meeting the contending Commissioners on the actual scene of dispute, I was compelled to resort to previous know ledge of the question in detail and strong pressure at Tehran, to obtain the practical decision . r™ . . . . j • .v • • , declared in the letter of Mr. Alison to Lord Gran- Note, dated 1st September 1871. yille,§ No. 131, of the 5th September 1871. No information since obtained has caused me to change my opinion on the truth of the arguments influencing the said decision, which resulted in the unqualified acceptance by Persia of a line of boundary from the northernmost point at which her annexations join the Kelat territory down to the seaboard. The question raised about Kohuk originated in a request on the part of Persia that the disposal of that district might be reconsidered. If, to my mind, there existed any true grounds for reconsideration, they were not to be sought for in any incompleteness of settlement, but because— 1st. According to evidence of rightful possession, Kohuk could not really be awarded to Kelat any more than to Persia. 2nd. It would make a far more compact and better boundary for Persian than for Kelat territory. On the other hand, I had reasons for giving Kohuk to Kelat in— 1st. The refusal of the Persian Commissioner to investigate the question on its merits. 2nd. The statement to myself of the Kohuk Chief, Mir Murad. 3rd. The belief that the district would hold itself independent under Kelat, whereas it would inevitably succumb to Ibrahim Khan if made over by England to Persia. 4th. The charaeter of the recent Persian encroachments in Mekran, and great extension of her heretofore acknowledged frontier into the heart of Baluchistan. It will be observed that the present case was not one of arbitration, as that of Seistan, but rather of settlement under approval of the Government of India. The proposed modifi cation which I had the honour to submit was in the belief that a quasi concession to Persia was contemplated, and, although not concurred in by the subsequent despatch from Simla, the proposal substituted seemed to foreshadow a result which might not in practice prove dissimilar.9 ift 74 LettertoForeign0ffice,22ndJune Ultimately the following letter was addressed to the Foreign Office* regard X it tt KeU frZfer^ been drawn to the east of Kohuk, but that it was not the intention of the British Commis sioner on rev,smg the original settlement, to define the Persian frontier in this qu^““at all, but simply to show the line ot territory awarded to Kelat.

Her Majesty’s Minister appears to have rightly apprehended the position in his statement to the Persian Minister of Foreign Affairs. The question, moreover, arises whether some decision should not be arrived at for the permanent disposal of the Kohuk district. Should not the ^ revised note be either, once and for ever, accepted or declined. It is true that the main object of my settlement was the security to Kelat of Punjghur and Kedj, both threatened in 1869 and immediately preceding years, and this appears to have been achieved. But the question of Kohuk, however remote the locality, should not, I deferentially venture to suggest, be left in uncertainty. ** Letter to Foreign Office, 25th Lord Salisbury’s decision was couched February 1875, No. 89. ffi the following terms:—** ****** In reply, I am to state that the original decision of Her Majesty’s Government in the Mekran arbitration, as accepted by the Shah on 4th September 1871, excluded Kohuk from the possessions allotted to Persia and awarded it to Kelat. This decision was so far subsequently modified that the boundary of the latter State was drawn to the east instead of the west of Kohuk, thus excluding Kelat from that district, although not formally allotting it to Persia. This modification was not accepted by the Persian Government, in consequence of which the original award as pointed out by Mr. Thomson holds good. 17358. C10 Under these circumstances. Lord Salisbury would suggest that Mr. Thomson should be instructed to inquire if the Shah is willing to assent to the line of Kelat boundary laid down in the amended note which was submitted to His Majesty’s Government in substitution of that presented on 1st September 1871. In such case, it should be pointed out, as stated in my letter of 22nd June last, that “ under any circumstances the line drawn east of Kohuk must clearly not be transgressed.” In the event of Persia declining to accept the modified note above alluded to, Persia has obviously no right to interfere in Kohuk, from which district that power was excluded by the original award to which she gave her assent. Shortly after this letter had been sent to the Foreign Office, a des patch was received from the Govern- F ? r rollti ?j! L !o\ e ^Q^- m India ’ 19th ment of India,* to whom Mr. Thomson February (No. 49) 1875. , , , , had reported his proceedmgs, stating that they had approved of the same, and suggesting whether he “ might “ not be desired to urge the formal ratification of the revised note, “ after which no objection need, in our opinion, be raised to the occupa- “ tion of Kohuk by Persia, certainly not in the interests of Azad Khan, “ who is a restless intriguer, and has often shown himself ill-disposed “ towards the British Government.” This Despatch from the Government of India was forwarded to the .

The Persian Government do not appear to have given any written reply to this communication, hut discussed the matter with Mr. Thomson, who expected that the revised note would be shortly formally “ signed and ratified.” This expectation, however, was not fulfilled. Delay after delay occurred on the part of the Persian Government in signing the revised p T . * „ . , note,§ till at length, after repeated in- October 1875, No. 720. terviews on the subject between Mr. Thomson and Mirza Saeed Khan, in which the latter urged that any representation his Government might wish to make relative to Kohuk should be received by the British Government prior to the signature of the note,—a course of proceeding to which HerMajesty’s representative at Tehran strongly objected,—the Persian Minister entreated “ Mr. Thomson not to press the matter further for “ the present, so that he (Mirza Saeed Khan) might have an opportunity “ of learning, through Mirza Malcolm Khan, Lord Derby’s sentiments “ with reference to its final decision.

In para. 4 of our Despatch above quoted,** we communicated to your Lordship our ** No. 49, dated 19th February 1875. opinion that, after the formal ratification by the Persian Government of the revised note of 1873, no objections need be raised on the part of the British Government to the occupation of Kohuk by Persia. From the correspondence forwarded herewith, it appears that there is a continued hesitation on the part of the Persian Government to accept the revised note and10 11 T&amp;° ti# • a od, under these circumstances, we consider it necessary to draw the attention of Her Majesty s Government to the embarrassment which will ensue’if Persia be allowed to annex Kohuk, and leave an unaccepted boundary between Kohuk and Kelat 3. Such a state of affairs would practically undo the whole work of the late Boundary Commission, and we Me therefore of opinion that, unless the Persian Government accepts the note and map of 1873 m their integrity, Her Majesty’s Government should insist upon adherence to the note and boundary of 1871, already accepted by the Persian Government, in which case Persia should be called upon to evacuate Kohuk. 4. In conclusion, we would suggest the desirability of issuing such instructions to Her Majesty s Minister in Persia as will ensure an early settlement of this matter. * sJktLetter from India, No. 200&gt; , ® ir . H * ^awlinson has recorded the dated 14th October 1875. rollowing important Memorandum re specting this Despatch:—* I cannot accept the views of the Government of India on this question, nor, indeed, can I tully understand the argument by which those views are supported. If the Government of India is prepared to admit the occupation of Kohuk after the formal ratification of the revised note of 1873, why should it heaitate to declare the line of frontier as fixed by that note, and passing to the east of Kohuk, to be the definite boundary between Persia and Kelat i It is true that General Goldsmid, in the first instance, assigned Kohuk to Kelat, because the Persian Commissioner attached to the Arbitration neglected to prove the right of the Shah to the district in question ; but, on further examination and inquiry, General Goldsmid admitted that the right of Kelat was equally unproved, and he proposed accordingly, in the revised note of 18/3, to leave the district as a sort of neutral territory, the frontiers of Kelat being drawn to the east of it, and the frontier of Persia to the west’ and the Government of India seems to consider it a point of honour to uphold this award’ of their Commissioner. But the Persian Government very justly argues that the function of the Commissioner was to arbitrate on a disputed line of frontier between Persia and Kelat, not to create independent intermediate States ; and it thus assumes that what is not assigned to Kelat must, of necessity, belong to Persia, which principle, accordingly, the Shah seems to desire that we shall officially admit. The true reason, I believe, why the Shah hesitates to accept and ratify the revised note is that he mistrusts our policy. Since there is no difference apparently between the terri torial result as desired by him and as admitted by us, Kohuk in both cases coming into the possession of Persia, he is fain to suspect that our persistent opposition to his wishes must cover some deep political design, such, for instance, as the possible assertion of the right of Kharan, a fief of Cabul, to the district in question, a claim which might consist with our interests, but which we should be debarred from supporting if we had definitively assigned Kohuk to Persia. There is not, of course, in reality any such “ arriere pensee ” upon our part. It is a mere point of honour with us not to allow Persia to have too much of her own way ; and thus for a shadow, a simple formality which possesses no importance whatever, and regarding which, as far as the merits of the case are concerned, we are, I believe, altogether in the wrong,—for Kohuk does most decidedly belong to Persia, both geographically and historically,—we are causing an amount of irritation and ill will at Tehran which imperils substantial interest, and may lead to the most serious results. The Shah’s proposal now is to transfer the negotiations regarding Kohuk from Tehran to London, and that is, I believe, the safest course to pursue on the present state of affairs, which is really becoming critical. At any rate, I would not follow the recommendation of the Government of India to adopt stringent measures for enforcing the Shah’s acceptance of the revised note, as that would very possibly lead to a suspension of our relations with the t Persian Court. While the last-mentioned Despatch from the Government of India was *under consideration, a further ^ F Qrr Sn 0ffice ’ 29th • No ' letterf was received from the Foreign Ofhce, enclosing, for the Marquis of Salisbury’s opinion, a communication from the Persian Minister at this Court addressed to the Earl of Derby, urging him to send telegraphic instructions to the British Legation at Teheran to suspend all fresh action relative to Kohuk, in order that the question might be referred to London to a special Conference. “Her Britannic Majesty’s Commis sioners,” adds Haji Malcolm Khan, “who met together respecting the “ settlement of these frontiers, being in London, and I myself, having “ received ample instructions on the subject, we could easily arrive at a “ satisfactory solution, and avoid misunderstandings in regard to form, “ which at this moment threaten in a sad way to pervert the simple “ character of the question.” O. T. Btjrne, Lieutenant-Colonel, India Office, Secretary Political and Secret Department. 10th December 1875.. A. N. W.APPENDIX. Amended Note substituted for that signed and sealed by the late Mr. Alison and the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, on the 1st September 1871. As, under the agreement concluded a$ Tehran on the 1st September 1871, by the late Charles Alison, Esquire, C.B., Her Britannic Majesty’s Envoy Extra ordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Persia, and Mirza Saeed Khan, Minister of Foreign Affairs to His Majesty the Shah of Persia, it was pro posed that, for purposes of future reference and identification, an English Officer of Engineers should meet an Officer duly appointed by the Government of Persia, to lay down the more permanent landmarks and features of the actual line of frontier between Persian Baluchistan and the Kelat State determined by the British Com missioner, Major-General Goldsmid, making a careful survey thereof for record; and as, under the terms of the said agreement, Major St. John, an Officer of the British Royal Engineers, and Mirza Ashraf Ali Khan, a nominee of the Persian Government, both deputed on the aforesaid duty, proceeded to carry out the work required, and returned to Tehran with maps, which maps have been duly sub mitted for inspection; and as, moreover, the Persian Government have moved Her Britannic Majesty’s Government to reconsider the question of the exclusion of the Kohuk District from the Persian, and its inclusion within the Kelat territory ruled by the British Commissioner,—the delineation shown in the accompanying map, explained in the following verbal description of frontier, is understood on both sides to be correct and binding in substitution of any former drawing, paper, or agree ment whatever, as now certified by the undersigned, Her Britannic Majesty’s Minister at the Persian Court, acting on the part of his Government, and , Ministerial representative of the Government of the Shah of Persia,— Commencing from the northernmost point, or that which is furthest from the sea, the territory of Kelat is bounded generally to the west by the large Persian District of Dizzuk, which is composed of many dehs, or minor districts, those on the frontier being Jalk and Kalegan. But below the two last named, and between Dizzuk and Punjghur, is a tract of land called distinctively Kohuk, but comprising Kohuk, Kunabasta, and Isfunda, with reference to which the line will be drawn so as to include the barren lands of Gurh and Segzi within the limits of Punjghur, these lands thus marking the actual Kelat frontier. 2. Below Punjghur, the frontier possessions of Kelat to the sea are Boleida, including Zamiran and other dependencies, Mund, and Dusht. Within the Persian line of frontier are the villages or tracts belonging to Sirbaz and Bahu Dastyari. The boundary of Dusht is marked by a long line drawn west of the Draboly Hill, situated between the rivers Bahu and Dusht, to the sea in the Bay of Gwuttur. 3. To summarize,—Punjghur, including Gurh and Segzi, also Parum and other dependencies; Boleida, including Zamiran and other dependencies ; Mund, including Tump, Nasserabad, Kedj, and all districts, dehs, and dependencies to the eastward; Dusht, with its dependencies as far as the sea,—these names exhibit the line of frontier of Kelat, that is to say, all tracts to the east of the frontier of actual Persian possession, which frontier comprises Dizzuk, inclusive of Bampusht, Sirbaz and Peshin Bahu and Dastyari. 4. It is, moreover, understood that the Persians assert no claim, right, or title to the tracts north of Punjghur, or on the right bank of the Mashkid river, from Kohuk upwards. 5. And it is provided that any minor disputes as to doubtful land, water, right of way, &amp;c., &amp;c., which may eventually arise, and cannot be settled by the litigants themselves, shall be referred for decision to the British Political Agent at Gwadur. 6. The undersigned, on behalf of their respective Governments, exchange con- gratulations on the happy termination of this troublesome question, and in the consequent removal of those serious causes of trouble and anxiety which disturbed the harmonious relations so desirable to cultivate between the authorities of Great Britain and Persia. 17358.

Specifically, it focuses on whether Kohuk should be awarded to either Persia or Kelat, or left independent. The narrative is primarily illustrated through extracts of correspondence on the matter sent between British and Persian officials. It largely draws on the opinions of Sir Frederic Goldsmid and Sir Henry Creswicke Rawlinson concerning the proposed status of Kohuk.The appendix consists of a copy of an amended note substituted for that signed by Charles Alison, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Persia, and Mirza Saeed Khan, Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, on 1 September 1871.
