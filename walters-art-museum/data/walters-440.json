Judging from her fine clothing and elegant hairstyle, as well as the scale and quality of her statue, we may assume that Nehy was able to afford a fine burial to ensure her place in the afterlife. Most likely this statue, one of two known, graced a tomb at Saqqara, the ancient necropolis of Memphis.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1924", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/22976", "Keywords": "Enehey; Mistress of the House; Chantress of the Mistress of the Southern Sycamore; Hathor; Osiris; musician; sistrum; rattle; hair; fashion; music; Ka; hieroglyph", "Provenance": "Ch\u00e2teau des Aygalades, near Marseilles; Jacques Seligmann, Paris, 1917, by purchase [from an unnamed Marseilles dealer]; Henri Daguerre and Joseph Brummer, between 1917 and 1921, by joint purchase; [Judge Samuel Untermeyer, New York, 1922, by purchase]; Joseph Brummer, Paris and New York, Brummer inv. no.
