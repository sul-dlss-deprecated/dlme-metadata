India on his relations with that country under the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation _ signed in 1939. In a recent letter to the Political ™ | Resident, the Sultan has indicated his intention of raising the matter again. /r. The general question of the relations with the Arab rulers of the Gulf and the Dominion of India is under i consideration, but in their despatch No. F15-PG/47 of the • 30th April, 1947» the Government of India have indicated their intention of establishing separate representation, possibly at ^Ahrein and Muscat. In view of Muscat’s special position whfcefe is necessary to treat the question of the Sultan’s relations with India and Pakistan separately^ Muscat is internationally an independent State free to conduct its own foreign relations. The existing A Treaty between Muscat, H.M.G. and the 1 Government of India was signed 'for India** on 3th February, 1939* by Sir Trenchard Fowle, then Political Resident in the rersian Gulf, India th£ls remains a party to the Treaty. The position of Pakistan is that as a member of the British Comnonwealth of Nations this country can accede to the Treaty in accordance with the provisions of Article 20. It/ TIt is not unlikely that separate representation will cause difficulties in regard to Articles 13-16 of the Treaty which deal Ac with extra-territorial Jurisdiction over British subjects and British protected persons. It seems likely that the Sultan will refuse to grant such concessions to any Indian represent at i - *^^ and that he would contend that these Articles only contemplated the existence of one British Consular Court and that all persons over whom that Court was exercising Jurisdiction would remain British subjects or British protected persons. Should India leave the British Commonwealth of Nations, the Sultan might further argue tiiat articles 13-16 would cease to apply as nationals of India would no longer be 'subjects of His Majesty'. o0 ^ ar as Pakistan is concerned we have no information as to their intentions, and as a number of subjects of this Dominion reside in Muscat it is important that we should know whether Pakistan intends to accede - to the Treaty as soon as possible. Before proceeding further with this matter, it seems essential to ascertain the attitude which the Dominion Governments of Pakistan and India wish to adopt. When this is known it will be possible for the Sultan to be informed of the position and for.the Political Resident 1 to secure his reactions in detail. fiL, ^ ^ drafts to Pakistan and India submitted.,far India by Sir Trenchard Powle, the then Political Resident in the Persian ^ India/ thus remains a party to tie.

N D EXE® «iill you please refer to your demi-official fc/^ letter imp, dated the 29th July 1S47, on the subject of the Muscat Commercial Treaty? 2. There is no objection from our point of view to•the hritish Consular Courts continuing to exercise jurisdiction over subjects of the Dominions of India and Pakistan so long as these countries continue to regain in the British Commonwealth of .Nations, and their nationals continue to remain British subjects or British protected persons. The Sultan is unlikely to object- 3. i can see no alternative because even should the sultan accept that xndia has the right to appoint a Consul in Muscat, i agree that he would be reluctant to allow this official to exercise jurisdiction over Indians in Muscat 4. Should either India or Pakistan leave the Common wealth we should no longer be able to exercise jurisdiction over their nationals, who would no longer remain subjects of His Majesty; and the sultan would for the same reason object to the exercise of such jurisdiction by us. The best course would appear to be in the conclusion of an agreanent between Muscat on the one hand and India and Pak istan (after the Patterns accession), separately on the other, that the ttreaty should become terminable on short notice on either side in respect of either Dominion ^iich left the British Commonwealth. 5. un the hypothesis that India remains a party to the Treaty, and that Pakistan is a new member of the British Commonwealth of .Nations, Pakistan would presumably have to accede to the Treaty before it could enjoy any of the commer cial rights under the Treaty, though such accession is not necessary for nationals of Pakistan, qua British subjects, to continue under the jurisdiction of the British Consular Courts. 6. i am sending a copy of this letter to Stewart.

Muscat Since you wrote to us, the situation in India has been clarified to the extent that India and Pakistan are to be set up as Dominions. On the immediate hypothesis that Hindustan, continuing the identity of India, and Pakistan, a new member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, remain in the British Commonwealth of Nations and the nationals of both these for the time being remain British subjects or British-protected persons, the position would be, but for Articles 13 to 16 of the Treaty, relatively simple; since Hindustan continues the identity of India it remains a party to the Treaty and Pakistan can accede to the Treaty under Article 20 as a Dominion. Thence forward the Sultan of Muscat could, if he wished denounce the Treaty separately in respect of the United Kingdom, Pakistan or Hindustan upder Article 23* But there are the provisions of Articles 13 to 16 which provide for consular extra territorial jurisdiction over British subjects and British-protected persons, and the Sultan at any rate can make a case for saying that these Articles only contemplated the existence of one British consular court and that all the persons over whom that court was exercising jurisdiction would remain British .subjects or British-protected E. P. Donaldson, Esq., G.M.G, India Office* /personspersons. For so long as Hindustan and Pakistan remain in the British Commonwealth of Nations any difficulties could he got over if, with the Agree ment of these Governments, we were able to assure the Sultan that His Majesty’s Government’s representatives in Muscat would he in charge of the interests of hoth Indian States and there would only he one consular court. Thereafter the possibility that either Hindustan or Pakistan might go out of the British Commonwealth of Nations might he go-t over by providing that, if they did so it was agreed on hoth sides that the Treaty should become terminable in respect of any part of India which left the British Commonwealth of Nations on short notice on either side. In any case the Sultan might with some justice contend that the provisions of Articles 13-16 would cease to apply to nationals of either territory if they leave the British Commonwealth, as such nationals would no longer he ’’subjects of His Majesty’’. We -are inclined to think that the first thing to do is for you to put the matter to the authorities in India on this basis and see what the Indian Govern ments want. They may prefer to propose to the Sultan that, so far as their part of India is con cerned, the Treaty should be immediately terminable. If this were the case, we do not imagine that the i Sultan would have any objection.LITICAL AGENCY, MUSCAT. d 20th May, 1947 Dear Colonel Hay, * 4 Please refer to your D.O. No. P/15, dated the 29th April, 1947. A list of British subjects living in this area is given below. The figures are only approximate. In the case of Gwadur no community-wise figures are available. The only people who have not settled down here and still regard India as their home-land are the Sonaras (goldsmiths) and Banias. The bulk of the banias come from Cutch State though a good number of them belong to Sind province or Gujarat and are exporters of Muscat products and or me oanias have been established here for generations and hold considerable immoveable property. A few of them are employed by the State. Sonaras (No. 3) have also been established here for generations but keep regular intercourse with India and do not consider Oman as their homeland. country as their home-land though they appear to be firmly settled in Mutrah. All except a few are regis tered as British subjects by birth and they claim Karachi as their home-land. They dress in the style of Indians. * They deal in export and import - mainly export of fish. The Khojas (or Hyderabadis) community appears to be the oldest. They themselves do not exactly know their country of origin. If questioned, they say their ancestors came from Cutch and Hyderabad (Sind). They regard Mutrah as their home, and only in rare instances have connections with or relations in India. Almost half of this category of Indians have already adopted Muscat nationality. They are exporters and importers, shopkeepers, brokers, etc. The Hobble Lieutenant Colonel W. R. Hay.

They regard Muscat as their home-land. According to the statement submitted by the British Agent, Gwadur, in January last, the total number of British subjects in Gwadur is 657.

(a) Muscat. ^ I understand that even if India leaves the British Commonwealth she will probably be entitled to the benefits of the existing treaty until it expires in 1951. Thereafter, or before if she wishes, she can negotiate a separate treaty. Such a treaty might cover representation of India in Muscat and vice-versa and most favoured nation treatment in respect of trade,. siiipping and aircraft.

The Sultan is not expected back in Muscat until Movember and it is unlikely that it will be possible to explain the position to him orally until then. 3. Meanwhile I should be grateful if you could kindly let me have a more detailed explanation of the grounds on which Indian nationals will be able to claim continuance of the treatment to be accorded to British subjects under the Treaty as I think it may be difficult to convince the Sultan that they will be entitled to the treatment defined in Article 13 of the Treaty when they cease to be British subjects e.g. the definition of 'nationals of His Majesty' in Article 1 (II). 4. I assume that if as appears possible an Indian Consul is appointed at Muscat before India becomes completely independent he will not be able to exercise any judicial functions unless the Muscat Order in Council^1939, is amended. As far as I know at present the Governmmnt of India are thinking of appointing a non-official as Consul and they may therefore be content to allow the Political Agent to continue to exercise Judicial functions in respect of British Indian subjects for the *time* being. If India leaves the British Commonwealth some kind of Indian Foreign Jurisdiction Act will presumably have to be passed before the Indian Consul at Muscat can be empowered to try cases. In these circumstances there may well be a hiatus during which it will not be possible for any Indian subject in Muscat to be prosecuted or sued - a most unsatisfactory position. However I do not thAAk we need look quite so far ahead as this at present.DRAFT LETTER / Qs**** &gt; ), Tlie l o . % KonM.t. Col.

It is therefore a treaty which must on any possible view continue to be binding on India and watt reciprocally binding on the other party; and will be unaffected as regards either the rights or obligations thereunder of either contracting party by the intended change in the internal constitutional position of India, which will have no effect on the separate international status which India already enjoys. It will, of course, as you say, be open to the Sultan to give notice under Article 23 that he wishes to terminate the obligations as between Muscat and India with effect from the 11th February, 1951. We suggest that the Political Resident should be instructed to explain the legal position to Sultan when a suitable opportunity occurs. E.P. Donaldson, Esq., C.M.G. , India Office. (T. Garran)V DRAFT LETTKR I. P. G-arran, Esq., 7 MAR 1947 Foreign Office, London, S.W.1. iji U Dear Garran, uliilenewas here last October, Colonel Hay recorded a note, of which I enclose a copy, about the attitude of the Sultan - of L'uscat towards the Coraraercial Treaty of 5th February 1939 {(Mt-Goyi) in the event of the establishment of* an independent Government of India. This Treaty is included in the list , . of ocn MiiCi’oia.l treaties b gtwsaaa^idia and foreign oountriee/which we ape-to ■qongl'.tey with 4re^/v;hi oh, 3 , Beckett and others in the Foreign Officey^/ in connection with the drafting of 'Treaty No. 1.' with India, to deal with matters relating to the transfer of power. I think, however, that we ought perhaps to let Hay know/know, before we go much further, that the interpretation which the Sultan apparently places on his legal position under the Treaty does not correspond with the views held by think tha% it is clear from Becketts Opinion of 19th March last that this Treaty falls into Category A in his paragraph 5, viz., Treaties signed after 1919 'for India” about which no possible question can arise. According to Beckett these Treaties must on any possible view continue to be binding on India and, I suppose, that tiWmust be considered as reciprocally binding on the other party. If this is the case^the benefits of the Treaty will accrue to India after the transfer of power, whether she remains within the Commonwealth C-4t-v*» eM «■ CP«r»v/»v\ ca. or not, and Indian n a t i ona I s/w P 14&lt;. eon t •mur. en ji-iy ^g —» ^ ^ CtJ* ' the treatmen'^specified in the Treaty. It is, of course, open to the Sultan to give notice under Article 23 that he wishes to terminate the obligations as between Muscat and India ’with effect from 11th February 1951, but it does not seem open to termination/- 2 - termination before that date, except by mutual consent, and we cannot expect that India's consent would be given unless the Sultan were willing to give -Indian nationals the same privileged position which they occupy now. We should be glad to have your views on this generally, and in particular on the instructions to be given to the Political ur i f Resident in case the 1 matter comes un/for discussion in the near future. ( 3 *d) E. P. DONALDSON —m % Secretary^ Eccoiaai^/Department , (/O You should see the noting below about the Coum#ercial Treaty with Muscat which is included as Serial No*6 in List A/ef your Departments note of lifth February. f If Mr.Becketts thesis holds the field, I cannot see that there is any room for doubt but that the benefits of this Treaty will accrue to India after the transfer of power whether she remains within the Conmonwea f lth or not. As I read Mr.BeckettS opinion^the obligations jDxblie t y Sultan of Muscat - which extend until February, 1951 will au tana tic ally/pa*e to the successor Sovernment/and the benefits will Tall to be enjoyed by Indian nationals whether they are subjects of His Majesty or British protected persons or not. But we should certainly discuss this with the Foreign Office at the forthcoming meeting as a test case. ^ ^ Art - a-t* ^Qaj Meanwhile perhaps I should communicate Colonel Hay*s note of 18th October to the Eastern Department and ask for their comment on it with a view^fco instructing the Political Resident to say nothing^to the Sultan at this stage, even though it is found that the latter^ views are not based on an accurate reading of international law. 2k Mr. Donaldson I agree that it would appear from Mr. Beckett’s Opinion that this Treaty will continue to be valid as between Muscat and an independent India. If the Sultan considers/considers that its provisions would no longer be appropriate in the event of India leaving the Empire, it is open to him under Article 23 to give notice before 11th February, 1950 that he wishes to terminate it as between Muscat and India with effect one year later. It seems to me, however, to be for consideration whether in those circumstances he is entitled to argue that the assumptions on which he negotiated the Treaty no longer obtain and that he is entitled to denounce it immediately on India (or any paid: of India) attaining independence and quite apart fran the provisions of Article 23. I suspect, however, that Muscat is econanically so dependent on India that if he took that line, an independent Government of India could quickly bring him to heel. As regards your letter to Mr. Dunbar, I shall actually be here next Tuesday (but not I hope on Y/ednesday). Incidentally Tuesday is 4th March not 3rd March.*v Jfi'uh fT2s *rGi J Lep^al Adxi^ser , H y , J ^ /»* rfte^uf /^ / L£+s i** Js-fo*. /+&lt; J' 6 'h+ttix **~S e%y /ivn '/$**#*{ fv~iylJC Co'tM LLA+i. 6 f 7)^' &lt;j*i/ k^^lt Astfc cfalMMj&gt;j*,&lt;A*tt &lt;5C UtTteiifi /) T%&gt; R*. f ^4 /x+*J&gt;»~{% } Please see Colonel Hay*s note below. &gt;^7%. The Muscat treaty of 1939 is not a political treaty between Governments, but a commercial treaty between His Majesty as Ruler of the United Kingdom and Emperor of India on the one hand, and the Sultan of Muscat on the other. Its main provisions are for most favoured nation treatment for British subjects; including in this, Indians and people under British protection, excepting subjects of the ten Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms. The Dominions and Colonies could adhere to the treaty if they wished by means of adherence and accession clauses. t ^ K \US On the formation of a completely independent India the King would presumably cease to hold the title of Emperor of India, and Indians would cease to be included among British subjects; probably mcmboro of Indian States would also cease to be included among British protected persons. It ^seems to me that the treaty would then automatically cease to apply to such persons as they would not come into the category of 'subjects of His Majesty and all persons under His protection wherever domiciled' and at the same time India &lt;vould automatically come into the category of 'a foreign country' which 'shall mean in relation to His Majesty's nSiae country or territory not under the sovereignty, protection, surzerainty or mandate of His Majesty'. The principle.of Successor States explained by Mr. Beckett in his memorandum on the subject can hardly apply in such a case. / Under these Circumstances the treaty would probably become null as between Muscat and India as /I soon/soon as India declared her independence. The t eras of the preamble would require a certain amount of modification to exclude India but a formal denunciation of the treaty would hardly seem to be applicable. It would probably be sufficient for a declaration to be made on one side or the other, that the treaty no longer applied between Muscat and India from the moment that India ceased to be a Member of the British Commonwealth of Nations. of Indians in the most favoured nation treatment in Muscat may, however, be far reaching in the internal affairs of the State. The latest trade returns show that both as regards imports and exports over 90 i of Muscat’s trade was with India. It is open to question whether the goods Muscat is able to £aport - principally dates, mats and fish manure - would find a ready market elsewhere and certainly the increased cost of carriage would mean that they could not command such a high price if marketed in a place to which the local craft, in which they are for the most part conveyed, could not go. It is also probable that the goods Muscat imports could be obtained elsewhere than in India, but once again the cost of carriage would probably mean a substantial increase in internal prices. The resrults of the ending of the inclusionLr. Harrison The Sultan, while I was at Unseat, raised the question of his Treaty with and the Government of India. I said I imagined that if a completely independent Government were formed in India that Government and the Sultan would b othhe at liberty to denounce the Treaty. The Sultan remarked that if India became independent he would not be willing to give Indian subjects the privileged position which they occupy now. (Signed) V. R.

The letter that refers to Article 15 is confidential *^nd will not be published. The question whether the other letters will be published ie under consideration. The Treaty was signed on the 5th February 'nd it is Intended to ratify it on the 11th February. o # ;;e do not think it will be possible to make our new ? 'uscst Order-in—C3uncil until about next lay. The practical reasons rendering it impossible to get this Order out simultaneously with 7 of the letters exchanged at the time of the signature the/ J.; . Stephenson, Esq., C.V.O., 0.3.E Dominions Office,the retlficntlon of the ^re«ty are being explained to the Sultan, who is being asked to agree that our court In Unseat may operate under the old Order for two or three months longer. 3. The draft Order-in-Council is being prepared and will have to be sent to the Government of India and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. At the same time a copy will be sent to the Dominions Office for eommunlcation to the Hnion High Commissioner, with an intimation that we do not think that any changes that may be made in it as a result of the observations of the Government of India or the Political Resident will be such as to be very material from the point of view of the TT nion Governr ent. As soon as the final draft of the Order-in-Council is ready, we will cost' uni cat e a copy to the Union Government. It will piohably only be possible to do this about the same time as the Order is submitted to the Privy Council and therefore it will be too late to make any alterations then. 4./ m4. As regards the High Com issloner's letter of the 13th December, it appear* th*t the Union Government «gre £ with the Dominions Office letter of the 14th October except for that pert where it was suggested that Muscat might be regarded as standing In a position similar to that of a British prot ect ed 81*1 . flii y r-1 n e no fnrth or DllJactions to the provisions of the ^refitjr, ^nelnding the provisions «bont extraterritorial larisdlctlon, nor do they dissent from the viev? that the discussions f t the Imperial Conference of 1937 only related to the exercise of jurisdiction obtained by 'resty end not to the conclusion of treaties providing for such jurisdiction. ^iirthrr they admit by implication that in the e*»ee of British protected states, including those in the Persian Culf, we do not have to consult them a a regard* the term* of our Orders-ln-Council or obtain their consent to exercise jurisdiction ovfr Union nationals. m hey take the vie however, th^t Muscat stands on q different footing and we admitted that technically it did. Of the two /two alternfltive methods of showing th«t extraterritorial jurisdiction over Hnlon natl^n«l6 In Muscat would be exercised with the consent of His Majesty’s Government in the Union, which were set out in the Dominions Office letter, they adopt the second and submit a draft proclamation. 5. A.8 regards the draft proclamation, we have the fallowing immediate observations to make, while reserving the right to suggest other minor amendments when our own Order is drafted. 6. In Articles 5 and 4 the TT nlon Government have inserted in their proclamation matters which in our case would n^t be dealt with in the Order- in-Council at all because they do not affect the action of our court. These matters would simply be left on the basis of the treaty, and we would suggest that it would be more appropriate and correct that the Hnion proclamation, the object of which is to sanction the exercise of jurisdiction by our courts over Union nationals, should only deal with matters w v 1c: actually affect the consular/CDnsular court and that therefore Articles Vp 3 and 4 should he omitted* 7. Art’cle ? deals with the position in the Sultan’s court where we have a treaty right, the substance of which Is reproduced In this Article* We should claim the observance of this treaty right, but we cannot enforce it or add to its validity in any way by leaning lerislative provisions of our own* S. Similarly, Article 3 deals with the action of the Soltan of ruscat's police and substantially the same comment applies. 9. Article 4 deals with what was an undertaking by both parties to the Treaty as to the manner in which they will exercise their jurisdict1 on. Tt is hardly a provision which can be enacted legislatively In this way and we should not put it in our Order-in-Counell* 10, Similar reasoning sugreats that in the preamble of the draft proclamation, the words ’♦end certain further privileges h*ve also been accorded/’’accorded’* at the end of paragraph 1 should he omitted *nd th^t the beginning of paragraph 3 of the preamble should read *And whereas It is ’’desirable that Union nationals should he rendered w bub.1ect to the jurisdiction etc.” 11. In paragraph 2 of the preamble, the penultimate line would, we think, read better If it said ’*..• representatives, over all His Majesty*® subjects within the territories of n H1 s Hi 'hness* ’* fours sincerely.FILE COPY ^ * 1^-' Allotted to 1 ollticeil Depertment, (64 622 Copies Circuletedo DKCYFHKR OF TEJL.KGH A _M From Politicel Resident in the Persian Gulf to aecrct&amp;ry of 6tate for IndiSo Dated Ho!«. 6o Deptford, 5th February, 1939 0 Received 12 0 15 hours, 5th February, 1939 through Admiralty^ X I^MuDIaTKc T/6, Addressed to India Office repeated Qovernir*ent of India, Bahrain and Koweit; copy given to Political Treatyo go I concur 0 3 0 Grateful if you would telegraph on what date communique will be brosdcasfco I presume it will be included in ordinary Arab programme?

A new treaty was signed at Muscat on - of February between His Majesty’s Government, represented by Sir Trenchard Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and the Sultan of Muscat, replacing the old treaty of friendship, 1891, and reaffirming close ties v/hich have existed between His Majesty's Government and the State of Muscat for nearly a century and a half. It will be remembered that the Sultan recently paid official visits to India and England. Ends. 3. To this the British Broadcasting Corporation and Press could add a short account of Muscat State from materials which are in possession of Government of India and India Office in connection with the Sultan’s visits. 4. I will consult Sultan on arrival at Muscat as to whether he approves of above communique and will telegraph.Political Department.

My dear Secretary of State, tilth reference to Mr. Stephenson’s letter of the 14th October to Mr. Scallan regarding- the draft Treaty between the United Kingdom and Muscat, my Government have askea me to submit the following observations for the information of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. The Union Government, after careful examination of the considerations advanced by the United Kingdom Government, regret that they are unable to subscribe to the doctrine that British consular courts have authority .to exercise jurisdictier- over Union Nationals in any country which is 'legally and technically an independent state' ana in which 'His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom do not exercise jurisdiction over ioreigners in general', merely by virtue of an agreement between the United Kingdom ana such country and an Order-in- Council issued by His Majesty on the aavice of His Majesty’s United Kingdom Ministers. To allow this would not only be derogatory to the Union’s position as an independent state but would also be in conflict y ith the provisions of section 7 of the Royal Executive Functions and Seals Act, 1934 (Act No. 70 of 1934) His Majesty’s Government in the Union, therefore, , feel bound to take action under section 7 of the said Act, and to advise the Governor-General to issue a proclamation of the nature oi the attached draft as soon as the relevant Order—in— oouncil has been issued by the King—in—Council at Westminster. The Union THJ3 SSCRKTARY OF STATE, DOMINIONS OFFICE, DOWNING STREET, S. w. 1 .&lt; • ^ * The Union Government would be much obliged if His Majesty’s Government in the Unitea Kingaom vould favour them vith a copy of the Draft Order-in-Gouncil in question, and the proposed date of issue, together with the necessary particulars about the Treaty \ ith Muscat, so as to complete their Proclamation in time to enable them to issue it shortly after or simultaneously with the Order-in-Gouncil. Believe me, Yours sincerely, (3d.). C. T. te Water.DH^T K.OCLAIutTI ON WHiiHKAB by Treaty between His Majesty the King in respect of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and His Highness the oultan of Muscat and Oman and Dependencies dated the freedom from jurisdiction of the Courts of His Highness in the territories of Muscat and Oman and Dependencies has been stipulated in certain respects, for all His Majesty’s subjects, and His Highness has consented to such jurisdiction being exercised by the consular representatives of His Majesty in His Government of the United Kingdom stationed in the territories of His Highness and certain further privileges have also been accorded, by the said Treaty to all His Majesty’s subjects; AND vd BRDAd His Majesty, in His Government of the United Kingdom has by Order-in-Council under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890, dated made provision for the exercise of such jurisdiction, by their consular representatives, over i.a. Union Nationals, within the territories of His Highness; AND wHHRBAS it is desirable that the rights and privileges thus acquired be made available to Union Nationals and they be rendered subject to the jurisdiction of the consular courts instituted by His Majesty in His Government of the United Kingdom under the Order-in-Council aforesaid; N0'.» THBRHF0R3 I, in virtue of the powers conferred on me by Section Seven of the Royal Executive Functions and Seals Act, 1954 (Act 70 of 1934) do hereby proclaim and order as follows: 1.

In all criminal and civil cases in which a Union National is complainant or plaintiff and the accused or defendant is a national of the Sultan or a national of a third country, which shall be tiieo. Dy the Courts of the Sultan, a national of the Union shall have a right of appeal, in accordance with the procedure prescribed in the Omani Courts, to the Sultan, or, if he so desires in the absence of the Sultan, to the Sultan’s representative, against any decision given against him in any such case if. . . a Union national shall not be arrested his property seized, nor his house, office, warehouse or other premises occupied by him entered and searched without his consent, by an officer of the isultan save under an order signed by the consul of . toHis Majesty, and any Union national arreslted any property of a Union national seized snail oe placed in the custody of the consul of His Majesty always provided that, in case of necessity for the prevention of breaches of the peace or a breach of a lav. or regulation of the Sultan which has b^eii made applicable to nationals of His Majesty under Article 15 of the Treaty, the authorities of the Sultan may without such an order arrest a Union national or take charge of his property or enter and search his house, office, warehouse or other premises occupied by him, but in this case the proceedings shall be at once reported, and the person arrested and any property seized hanaed over without delay, to the consul of His Majesty.

The Sultan’s assertion that the word has no restrictive religious meaning as stated by Mr.Arberry appears to be supported by the Dictionary ( Badger's) but this Agency hunahi declares that the latter's interpretation is that of all Islamic countries and is correct. However the point does not appear a very important one and since the Sultan has committed himself, in our exchange of letters to accept the meaning of this word as including all forms of law, it may perhaps be retained.

I am sorry not to have noticed the point when you consulted us semi-officially in August, but, it it is inconvenient to make an alteration now, no harm will be done. We assume that, before the draft is prepared for signature, punctuation will be checked. We noticed a few places where commas seem to have dropped out, and, in Article 20 (l), which concerns the Dominions Office, 'his” before 'Consular Officer' is spelt v/ith a small 'h', whilst in Article 5 (c), before 'Naval Forces', it is spelt with a capital 'H' .

October, 1938, 7 Sir, With reference to your letter No.P.Z.6777/38 of the 18th October, enclosing the draft of the proposed new commercial treaty with the Sultan of Muscat, I am directed to request you to confirm to the Secretary of State for India that no change in the draft is considered necessary as a result of the recent correspondence v/ith the High Commissioner for the Union of South Africa. 2. It is not desired to offer any further observations on the wording of the draft, except that, in the fourth line of Article 7, it might be an improvement to substitute the term 'territories' for the term'dominions as the former is defined in Article l(i) and the latter is not. If, however, this alteration would be inconvenient at this stage of the negotiations, it would not seem essential to make it.3. Subject to this observation, and to the concurrence of the other Departments concerned, no objection is seen by this Department to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf being instructed to sign the treaty both for Great Britain and Northern Ireland and for India. It would be appreciated if information could be sent to the Dominions Office as soon as the treaty has been signed. 4. It is assumed that the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs will be consulted in due course on the terms of any Order in Council which may be required to give effect to the new treaty. 5.

This pmetlee is based on the recotar^endations contained in a He port of the drafting Uostt ifctee of the tater-imperial gelations Uor^ ittee of the Imperial Jonfei^eno© of 1930 which were accepted by the representatives of the Governments then present, except those of tit© Irleh Tree £tate? a copy of the veport of the Oopfiittee is annexed for convenience of wwPircmni.

In the case of a srsall country like Muscat where the native courts are extrewely primitive and the local laws unsuitable In many respects for application to persona of Iuro]&gt;ean origin and where there is no institution tmoh as the UtmA Courts in : gypt as an alternative, the rlgirt of recourse to a Court maintained by the United Kingdom and the application of the low of British India rather than local law must, it is thought, be considered us indisputable a benefit, as are any of the other rights proposed to be obtained for British subjects generally under other provisions of the Treaty# The discussions which took place at the tirie of the Imperial Conference, 1957, and subsequently, regarding the application of extra-territorial jurisdiction, were understood by His Majesty’s Govemm^it in the United fftHgflffiffl to bo related to the omontao of jurisdiction when obtained by treatj r and not to the question of treaty provisions. hey would consequently be More relevant to t © later stage , namely, tlie issue of OrOera in Council for the exercise of right© secured by treaty. The United Kingdom Government do not wish to dissent from the view thatthat in general the exeroiee of extra-territorial JurioMction in foreign countries in respect 0 f British subjects belonging to the Union of South /Xrloft naist be regarded aa exercised with the consent of His Majesty’s Ooversmsnt in the Union; they would be quite rilling, if the Union Govcmnent should so deaire, ttiat the Order in Goiancil which will eventually require to be paased for the exercise of such Jurisdiction should be expressed to be passed at the request and with th© consent of the union Government, or, alternatively, if that course were preferred, that the Union authorities should themselves make the necessary arrangements for passing the Order required in respect of British subjects belonging to th© Union. '»v© feel, however, that the Union Gover*nr j jent isay */ell consider that Huscat, by reason of its c ecial position, can pi*operly be treated as striding in a different position from other foreign countries where extra-territorial Jurisdiction is or h^ s been until recently enjoyed, such m China, higypt and Morocco. Begslly and technically, Muscat is an independent tate and His MajestyGovernment in the United Kingdom do not exerciseexercise jurisdiction there over foreigners in general* In practice, however, owing to th© influence exercised there throw h tlie ovemraent of India and the Political o; ident in tuc ersian Ouif , us cat atcuuls in a 8i&gt;eoial position which has considertthle resellblance to that of a British protected state* In the case of British protected states - as for example the Persian Oulf Ehkeikhdmas of Kovelt and Bahrein - it is assumed that Ills Majesty’s Covei^aaent in the Union would not think of questioning; tlie right of Ilia Ha josh’s Oovi ir^oent in the United ingdom to cxex^cise jurisdiction over the righto of persons belonging to the Union as over other classes of British subjects, and other non-mttives such as United states citisexis ox* Preach nationals* Having regard to the special position of Buscat, it is thought that the Union Qovemsiient may feel it preferable to adopt a similar attitude to the exex*cise of extra-territorial jurisdiction in Muscat and not to 1 ‘c-gard it as necessary to indicate by one or other of the moans outlined above that author*! ty in the territory concerned over British subjects belonging to the Union is exercised on Uxe advice of His Majesty’s C-ovemient in tae Union. An early expression of the views( of the Union oov^mment on the ueetion of the Order in Council for the continued exercise aL' extra-territorial Jurisdiction of Ouoeat would he appreciated, as we aciould lixe to procovd ae soon ao possible with the drafting of the necoBeary Order* into force iKOct bcbru&amp;ry and the time inquired for the various legal foiiaalitiea would uaice it very desirable to put this in iiand at the latest by the middle of Cecansfcer, dovemjient by tiicn, we trugt that we may assume that th^r c emeur in a draft bd ng prcx&gt;ared on tiie basis suggested j?ho necessity for bringing the new Lreaty and, if we have not heard furUxer from the Union b . v •m r T. 576/39 1 ^ October, 1938« Bear iicallon.
