The various Chiefs of the independent districts of the so-called pirate coast have, during the year under review, maintained peaceful relations one with another. 5. At Shargah, indeed, a revolution occurred in April 1883, the Chief, Shaikh Salim-bin-Sultan, having been ousted from his position by his nephew, Sakar- bin-Khalid Khalih-bin-Sultan, but this change of rulers was happily effected without bloodshed. 6.

Shaikh Salim, although younger than his brother Khalid, and moreover the son of a slave woman, succeeded to the office of Chief of Shargah by the father's will. 7. Khalid-bin-Sultan, whose mother was Arab, resided quietly at Shargah till his death and was respected by the people, who would probably have preferred him to Shaikh Salim. 8. Towards the end of March 1883 Shaikh Salim, unsuspicious of danger, proceeded for change of air to the Island of Boo Moosa, where his horses were kept at grass. His brother, Ahmed-bin-Sultan, at the same time went to Ras -el -Khaimah, and their nephew, Sakar-bin-Khalid, was left in charge of Shargah. 9. Sakar-bin-Khalid, a young man of 20 years or under, took advantage of the oppor tunity, and, with the support of the people of Shargah, proclaimed himself Chief. 10. Shaikh Salim appealed to the Resident for advice and instructions, but the Resident, seeing no cause for British interference, replied to that effect, and instructed the native Agent at Shargah to maintain friendly relations with all parties, and to avoid any active interference in party matters.6 administeation eepoet of the peesian gulf political 11 In May Her Majesty's Ship Woodlark visited Shargah and found all quiet there and negoeiations on foot between Shaikh Sakar and Sahm. The new Chief had been recognized by the other Chiefs on the coast, and was supported by a body of the Is a eem tribe under their Shaikh Mohammed-bin-Ali. 12 Shaikh Salim was anxious that the Residency Agent should guarantee the fulfilment of conditions of an agreement between him and Shaikh Sakar, which, of course the Agent re- Led to do. Various questions were raised about the Island of Boo Moosa, the horses thereon and so forth, to which general answers were returned, and the rival Shaikhs were advised to come to an amicable arrangement. 13. In May Shaikh Salim paid a visit to Lingah, to consult with the Deputy Governor, Shaikh Yoosuf, who is of the same clan. Subsequently Shaikh Saxim sent a number of horses from Boo Moosa to Lingah. 14. In July Shaikh Salim having gone to Debaye, an agreement was effected between him and his nephew, the fulfilment of the terms by either side being guaranteed by the Chiefs of Ras-el-Khaimah and Debaye. Under this agreement Shaikh Sakar was to allow Shaik Salim a yearly allowance of 600 dollars, and the latter was to retain possession of his private lands and property; whilst Salim engaged to recognize and bear allegiance to Sakar. No mention was made m the agreement of the Shargah dependencies on the Batmah coast. 15. In January 1884, Shaikh Sakar addressed the Resident informing him that Shaikh Salim having failed to adhere to the terms of the treaty, the Chiefs of Ras-el-Khaimah and Debaye had declared themselves absolved from further responsibility in the matter. Shaikh Sakar stated that Shaikh Salim was residing on Boo Moosa, a possession of Shargah, and that it was to be feared this might lead to disturbances by sea. The Resident was asked to take security from Shaikh Salim, binding him not to break the maritime peace. 16. In reply. Resident informed Shaikh Sakar that he was sorry the agreement between him and Shaikh Salim had fallen through; that he did not apprehend any breach of the mari time truce on SalWs part, but that if he or others should infringe the rules relative to the sea they would be promptly repressed. 17. Up to the present the ex-Chief of Shargah continues to reside on the Island of Boo moosa. Shaikh Sakar governing Shargah. The condition of the dependencies on the Batinah coast is unsettled, and the situation generally cannot be regarded as stable, but there are no signs of Shaikh Salim's cause improving in its prospects. Shaikh Sakar has allied himself by marriage with the Chief of Ras-el-Khaimah. 18. The Chief of Abu Dhebbee had several affrays during the year with marauders of the tribes Al-Morrah, Monasir, and Beni Hajir. In August he asked assistance of the Chief of Debaye, who allowed his Bedouin dependants to join the Beni Yas. In October the combined forces defeated the Al-Morrah, killing about 30 and capturing some cattle. In October the Al- Morrah and Monasir made reprisals, and in November Shaikh Za'eed despatched a force of 750 men of various tribes as far as the vicinity of El-Obeyd, where they came on the Al- Morrah and killed 17 of that tribe, and captured over 1,000 camels. Other encounters occurred, but in December the Beni Yas Chief came to terms of peace with the Al-Morrah and other hostile tribes. 19. Heavy gales were experienced on the pirate coast in February and March last and several boats were wrecked. 20. A bad form of malarious fever prevailed daring the year, causing many deaths. 21. The pearl-diving was fairly productive, and a new bank was discovered in three fathoms, south of Halool island. 3.—BAHRAIN. 22. The Bahrain islands have enjoyed perfect tranquillity during the year. 23. In June Shaikh Mubarik, of the tribe El-Sabah, one of the Ivowait Shaikhs, came to Bahrain on a friendly visit to the Chiefs ; he was very warmly welcomed, hospitably treated, and received numerous presents on leaving. Shaikh Mubarik is sometimes employed by the Turkish authorities in affairs requiring diplomatic action, but if his visit to Bahrain had any object beyond pleasure, it did not transpire. 24. In September Her Majesty s Ship // oodlarlc having called at Bahrain on her way to Bushne, Shaikh Eesa-bin-Ali expressed his wish to pay the Resident a visit at Bushire, and Captain Nesham offered the Chief a passage across, which he accepted.EESIDENCT AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1883-84. 7 25. The object of Shaikh Eesa's visit was to make personal representations regarding the renewal of piracy in Turkish waters, and to ask permission to act, himself, against the piratical tribes : such action would have involved the landing of Bahrain men on territory under Turkish occupation, and the Resident explained to Shaikh Eesa the ill-feeling and complications which such action would necessarily entail. The Chief was also told that the British Govern ment was constantly urging the Turkish Government to take efficient measures to repress piracy, and the nature of the measures adopted by the Porte was explained. Shaikh Eesa saw the inexpediency of his acting in the manner proposed, and expressed himself quite satisfied to leave the matter in the Resident's hands, for representation to Government. 26. In October the tribe El-Sadah inhabiting El-Hadd of Bahrain, becoming discontented on account of a quarrel with another tribe, and supposed failure of the Chief of Bahrain to do them justice, determined to emigrate to Darein in the Kateef district, and wrote to the Nakeeb at Busrah asking permission to do so, which was accorded. Subsequently, however, Shaikh Eesa dissuaded the tribe from carrying out their intention. 27. The pearl divers had fairly good success in 1883. 4.—NEJD, EL-HASA, AND EL-KATR 28. Nejd. —Although the Government of the Porte appears to have been under the im pression that close relations existed between the British Government and the ' Ameer of Neid,' the fact is that we have no direct communications with the interior of Nejd, and it is difficult to obtain trustworthy intelligence from that country. Hostilities were kept up between the A1 Su'ood family, of whom Abdullah-bin Fey sal is Chief, and the Ameer of Jebel Shamar, Mohammed-ibn-Rasheed. Both sides appear to have had successes of no great importance, and the political condition of Nejd has not suffered any material change. 29. Ul-Easa.—ln June a vessel of Bahrain was seized, some pirates of the Bern Hajir tribe near El-Kateef, and in the affray the Bahrainee Nakhoda was wounded. He escaped to the shore, but subsequently died at Bahrain. Depositions attesting the facts of the ease were prepared and a report of the occurrence forwarded through the Political Agent m Turkish r rabia to Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, by whom a representation was made to the Porte. 30. M-Katr. —The Katr coast has been quiet, and Shaikh Jasin -bin-Mohammed Thanee, though somewhat discontented with his position, has given no cause {or complaint. 31. Numerous copies of proclamations, issued in the name o£ Mohammed A' 1110 ' 1 ' m-disant 'Mahdi' o{ Soudan, have been brought through Arabia to the shores of t le ersian Gulf, and have attracted, of course, much attention. The wording of some of these circu ars shadows forth the purpose of ' the guided one' to lead his followers to the conquest o gyp and Arabia. In the latter country there is reason to believe the ' Mahdi would, if successful, have the support of large numbers of the population. As in Soudan, the sympathy wit i « Maihdi' is at present more political than religious, the Arabs looking o un W1 some 0 P e as the destined instrument who is to restore their independence. An element of religious fer vour is by no means wanting, which, according to circumstances, may either die out oi be kindled into a flame. 5.—EARS. 34 No alteration has occurred in the chief administration of the province of Pars. His Royal Highness the Zil-es-Sultan exercises chief control over all its districts, with the excep tion of Lingah and Bunder Abbass, which torts are placed under the Ameen-es-Sultan, w 10 has now general control of the Customs Department throughout Persia. The Ameen es- Sultan has an agent, Mohammed Hasan Khan, who is invested with authority over un ei Iblrs and Lingah, and also has general control of the Custom Houses at those ports and at Bushire. . 33 Under His Royal Highness the Zil-es-Sultan, the titular Governor of Shiraz, is his son the Jelal-ed-Dowlab, but he being too young to exercise authority, the actual admmistia- tor of the Government of Pars is His Excellency the Sahib Diwan. 84 In December His Excellency the Kowwam -ul-Mulk, one of the most influential men in Pars' died rather suddenly, and the title has since been conferred on his son, Mohamme Reza Khan, who was Beygler-Begee, or Mayor of Shiraz.

The Government of Shiraz disavowed responsibility the district being beyond the limits of Ears, and the matter was referred to His 1 oyal Highness the Zil-es-Sultan, with what result is not known. 37. A few other cases of highway robbery occurred near Shiiaz. 38. Small-pox raged with great virulence in Shiraz during the autumn. 39. Mr. J. R. Preece, Assistant Superintendent of the English Government telegraph, examined the route from Shiraz to Bunder Abbass and Jask in February, in view to the possible construction of a line of telegraph between those places. 40. A French engineer surveved the Shiraz-Firozabad-Bushire route in connection with a project for construction of a line of railway between the Caspian Sea and the 1 ersian Gulf. 41. Buskire. Mirza Mohammed Hoosain Khan, son of the Sahib Diwan, was appointed Governor of Bushire in succession to the Naseer- ul-Mulk, and arrived in June. 42. The wealthiest Persian merchant of Bushire, Haji Baba, died in May, and his grand son and heir, Haji Mohammed Mehdi, received the titles of Malek-ut-Toojar and Rais-ut-Toojar. 43. In January Mirza Mohammed Hoosain Khan, Governor of Bushire, was summoned to Shiraz in view to his accompanying His Royal Highness the Zil-es-Sultau to Teheran. Haji Fazl Ali Khan, son-in-law of Mohammed Hoosain Khan, was sent to act as Deputy Governor of Bushire. 44. In April the period during which exportation of grain was allowed was extended, and the interdict was re-imposed in August. In February it was again removed for a period of four months. LING AH AND BUNDER ABBASS. 45. The revenues of Lingah and Bunder Abbas were managed respectively by Shaikh Yoosuf and Mohammed Hasan-bin-Nasir, both of whom act as Deputies for Mohammed Hasan Khan, the Ameen-es-Sultan's agent. COAST BETWEEN BUSHIRE AND LINGAH. 46. Shaikh Hassan-bin Mazkoor, son of the Khan of Kongoon, who was executed at Shiraz by the Motemir-ed-Dowlah, has fled to Bahrain. In April 1883 he landed at Tahri and caused considerable disturbances in the Gillahdar and adjacent districts, and Fath Ali Khan Gerrashee, Governor of Lar, was ordered to act against him. Some Persian infantry and a body of Baharloo Irregular Cavalry accordingly proceeded to those districts. Hasan-bin- Mazkoor, however, fled and escaped. Subsequently, further disturbances occurred in Gillahdar and Gaobandee from the people refusing to receive a new governor, named Naib Ibrahim Khan, one Ahmed-bin-Saif being the ringleader. 47. Naib Ibrahim having proceeded to Jam with a force of sowars and infantry to suppress a revolt there, serious resistance was made by the people of Jam, and in the affray several of the Baharloo sowars were killed. On this the Persian infantry and the sowars plundered Jam. Subsequently some thirty or forty men of Jam were seized as being guilty of the blood of the Baharloo sowars, and made over bound to the Baharloos, by whom they were of Jam 1 ' 6068 ' A laige &lt;1Uantlty of eameIs ' she «p. and donkeys, &amp;o., were taken from the people 48. A severe earthquake occurred on l«th October on the Persian coast which was felt at us ire, ongoon, Asloo, Tahri, &amp;c. Much damage was done at Kongoon and other coast villages, where shocks continued to be felt until October 21th, 6.—PERSIAN ARABISTAN. 49. This province is one of those under the supreme rule of His Koyal Highness the Zil- es-Sultan, whose Deputy the TbH^om ^ q u i ,, uie zai- I y, Ihtisham-es-Saltanah, usually resides at Dizful, which is alsoBESIDENCT AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1883-84. 9 the residence of Asad Khan, Governor of the district of Dizful. The town is the most populous one in Arabistan, though fallen into decay, and numbers some 12,000 inhabitants. The revenue of town and district amounts to 400,000 krans. 50. Muhammerah, —Muhammerah, with its dependent districts, is governed by Shaikh Mizal, whose elder brother, Mohammed, is still detained at Isphahan. Shaikh Mizal seems to have succeeded fairly well in establishing his authority. 51. In May 1883 the Prince Ihtishan-es-Saltanah arrived at Muhammerah with a regiment of Sirbaz, 52. In August the Nasar tribe of Arabs, a branch of the Beni Ka'b, revolted against Shaikh Mizal Khan, and shut themselves up in a mud fort, which Shaikh Mizal besieged. Eventually, after some casualties on both sides, the Hasan submitted and came to terms. This success greatly strengthened Shaikh Mizal Khan's position and led to establishment of tranquil lity and good order in his districts. 53. The revenue paid by Shaikh Mizal to the Persian Government for the Muhammerah district is 450,000 krans. 54. It was proposed to establish a Custom House at Muhammerah under Persian manage ment, and the Sa'ad-ul-Mulk visited Muhammerah in view to arranging the matter. This was, of course, a very distasteful project to the Arabs, and Shaikh Mizal succeeded in having it abandoned for the present. 55.

During the year the notorious sirteep Ibrahim Khan, of Bam, was reinstated as Governor of Bampoor and Persian Beloochistan, and from all districts there came reports of distress, the population emigrating in numbers to India and elsewhere. 61. The claims (referred to in last year's report) at Charbar for losses caused by the mis conduct of troops under Meer Hoosain Khan of Sirbas ■ were, after firm pressure had been brought to bear by Her Majesty's Minister at the Court of Persia, paid in full by the Gover nor of Kirman. 62. The Persian authorities of Kirman denied the truth of the report of the murder of an Indian in Baho, mentioned in last report, but further investigation was promised. 63. The Chiefs of Baho and Dashtyaree were reinstated in their districts, but Meer Deen Mohammed, Chief of Dashtyaree, was fined 6,000 tomans, and had to give his sons as hostages or security for payment. He himself went on a begging tour to 'Oman and Sind to raise money to pay the fine. 64. Some annoyances were caused to the Telegraph employes in the district of Meer Hotee, Chief of Gaih, and steps were taken to compel that Chief to afford satisfaction, GWADUR. 65. In January Major E. Mockler proceeded from Busrah on special duty to Mekran to meet Colonel Sir Robert Sandeman, whose Mission reached Gwadur in February. 66. Lieutenant-Colonel Miles, Political Agent at Muscat, also visited Gwadur in Her Majesty's Ship Dragon in February. 67. Mr. B.

On 7th June a north-westerly gale set in, lasting three days. During the period from 14th May to 10th July the weather, owing to the seasonable ' Barih,' or Arabian monsoon, was comparatively cool for the time of year. After the latter date a month or so of very trying weather was experienced. 76. The autumn and winter rains were unusually heavy, 19| inches having fallen up to April. An unprecedentedly abundant harvest was anticipated, but late and unseasonable rain caused a partial blight. 77. Few gales blew during winter.RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY EOR 1883-84. 17 PAET II. ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1883-84. Political. —Nothing had occurred during the early part of the year 1883 to disturb the general tranquillity of ''Oman, and the official year 1883-84 opened favourably. In May the Sultan attempted to renew negociations with Shaikh Hilal-bin-Zahir of the Beni Hina through the mediation of Hamood-el-J ahafee for the surrender of the fort at Nezwa, which Hilal had promised before to deliver up for a certain sum, but nothing came out of it, and the fort still remains in possession of Hilal. The quarrel that had arisen in the previous year between the Nidabiyeen and Rehbiyeen on the one side, and the Beni Jabir on the other, about the village of Seroor, now broke out afresh, and, in view of the behaviour of the former tribes, the Sultan began to consider whether the subsidy they received for holding the passes should not be transferred to the Beni Jabir. Shaikh Hamood-el-Jahafee sided with the Nidabiyeen in this affair, and His Highness endeavoured to entice him into Muscat, where he intended to seize him. But Hamood was stopped at Senail, and the plot failed. Offers of money were then made to induce Hamood to retire but they were refused: shortly after, however, Hamood, after unsuccessfully raiding the Beni Jabir, returned to Sharkiyeh. In the meantime the Beni Jabir, aided by a contin gent from Nakhl, occupied the Nidabiyeen houses in Seroor and cut down their date trees, and the latter were compelled to sue for a truce. At the end of June the Sultan received letters from His Highness Seyyid Abdul Azeez and Shaikh Saleh-bin-Ali, openly declaring their intention of assisting the Nidabiyeen against the Beni Jabir, whereupon, to avoid further complications and to put an end to the quarrel. His Highness despatched messengers to Semail to summon the Shaikhs of the Nidabiyeen, Rehbi yeen, Siabiyeen, and Beni Jabir to Muscat with a view to the final and amicable settlement of tlie whole question. On the 6th July, however, the Envoys returned to Muscat unsuccessful and reported that the Nidabiyeen and Rehbiyeen Shaikhs had gone to Sharkiyeh. His Highness Seyyid Toorkee now despatched Shaikh Shamis to his brother Abdul Azeez, desiring him to prevent any rising in the Sharkiyeh, to which Seyyid Abdul Azeez replied that the Rehbiyeen Shaikh had gone with the Haboos to Saleh-bin-Ali to concert an attack on the Beni Jabii, but, as ipgaids himself, he would not interfere if his brother Toorkee desired it. It is now well known that this quarrel about Seroor had been carefully fomented and increased, almost from the fiist, by the intrigues of Shaikh Saleh, whose subtle mind had perceived that if he could separate the two tribes holding the passes between Sharkiyeh and Muscat from allegiance to the Sultan he would have gained an important advantage in the event of his being able to organize another rising against His Highness. Not only did he succeed in this, but he managed to make the quarrel itself the pretext for his rebellious proceedings subsequently. The Beni Jabir now expecting an attack by the Sharkiyeh tribes applied to the Sultan for reinforcements, and His Highness prepared to move out to Semail in person. But from this he was dissuaded, and shortly after the Nidabiyeen wrote in to say that they would no longer receive His Highnesses subsidy or hold the passes for him. In July a collision occurred at Barka between the Wahabee garrison and the town's people, resulting in two men being killed and six wounded. The town's people having been worsted called in the aid of the Ma'Awalees, who came down and besieged the fort. Hie 'Wazeer Seyyid-Saeed, however, was despatched to Barka in the Dar-el-Salem, and effected a satis factory adjustment of the affair. Early in August it was reported in Muscat that a rising would certainly take place ^after the Kamzan E'ed) of the Hinawi trihes in Sharkiyeh to support the Nidabiyeen against the Beni Jabir, and it was expected that the insurgents would not confine tliemselves to the Semail valley, but continue their march to Muscat. On the 14th August news arrived that Seyyid Abdul Azeez and Shaikh Saleh, with a laige force had reached the Akk Pass, and two days later His Highness received letters from his brother and Saleh-bin Ali, announcing their intention of coming on to Muscat. Preparations were accordingly made for defence, and the friendly tribes were being called m when news arrived, on the 20th, of the break-up of the coalition and return of the insurgents to Sharkiyeh. 3administeation eeport of the peesian gulf political Shaikh Saleh wrote a pacific letter to His Highness to the effect that Seyyid Abdul Azeez and himself, having summoned the Semail tribes, had made peace between them, and that, their obiect beino- thus accomplished, they were returning home. A similar letter from Seyyid Abdul Azeez was also received. But the rebel leaders were dissimulating and their pretended friendly action in tranquillizing the tribes and withdrawing their men masked an ulterior design. Their apparent abandonment of the enterprise, as later events showed, was intended to throw His Highness off his guard and to mature their plans while watching for a more favourable opportunity. On the 8th September Seyyid Feysal was despatched to Nakh to settle disputes among the Shaikhs at that town, and about the same time Seyyid Nasir-bin-Mohammed, Wali of Mattrah, was employed to adjust misunderstandings among the Beni Battash in the Wady Taeen. Both of these missions were successful. So far from the discord in the Semail valley having been removed by Shaikh Saleh it had, in fact, become greatly embittered and strength ened, as he had hoped and intended it should, and the Sultan, being aware of the danger of the continuance of this quarrel, now sent for the Shaikhs of the Nidabiyeen and Rehbiyeen to Muscat, and used strenuous efforts to restore harmony between them and the Beni Jabir. Seyyid Feysal was subsequent^ sent to Semail to use his influence with the malcontents there, but his efforts, like those of His Highness Seyyid Toorkee, met with an entire want of success. The teaching and machinations of Shaikh Saleh had been too effective; the Nidabiyeen Shaikhs refused to listen to any terms and remained irreconcileable. The rebel leaders meanwhile were not idle. On the approach of Seyyid Feysal to Semail, Shaikh Saleh, with Abdul Azeez, entered the upper end of the valley to counteract his pacific schemes and to prevent any combination of the GhafRree tribes in that quarter. Shaikh Saleh was also indefatigable at this time in writing letters to the Hinawi tribes, inciting them to rise, and Shaikh Jumah-el-Meskeri, who had joined Shaikh Saleh out of a personal grudge he had against His Highness, wrote to the Shaikhs of the GhafRree tribes of Jaalan and ^Oman, warning them not to join Seyyid Toorkee in his defence againt the coalition. Shaikh Jumah^s letters had in many cases an opposite effect to what he intended, as Arabs are not fond of being dictated to, and several of the Ghaffiree Shaikhs subsequently supported His Highness out of pure opposition to Shaikh Jumah. Rumours of the rising reached Muscat, and some preparations were made to repel attack. But the rebels' intentions were not known for certain until the 19th October, when the Political Agent received a letter from Seyyid Abdul Azeez, announcing his hostile intentions and desir ing that the British subjects might be removed from danger. On the morning of the 21st 'the vanguard of the rebel force, estimated at 1,800 men, arrived at Rui, and the main body came up during the day. It was fully expected by the garrison that the enemy would rest that night in camp and attack Mattrah the next day. But Seyyid Abdul Azeez had devised a more skilful plan, and, while he was supposed to be encamped at Rui he was marching through the hills that encircle Muscat to take the town by surprise. The assault was delivered soon after mid- night by the lebels, who were dressed in black to escape observation, and, though the garrison were taken completely by surprise, they received the assailants with such a heavy and sustained fire that the latter were repulsed and driven from the walls with great loss. Seyyid Abdul Azeez behaved with much gallantry, personally leading his men up to the assault, but he was compelled to withdraw when he found the surprise had failed. The next day it was expected that an attack on Mattrah would be made, and, as His Highness had formally requested armed assistance, H. M. S. Philomel proceeded thither and threw a couple of shells over the rebels' position, deterring them from advance. For three days after the rebels main tained their position outside the town, threatening attack, and H. M. S. Philomel con tinued an irregular fire at intervals; but, in the meantime, the friendly tribes summoned by His Highness to his assistance began to pour into Muscat and soon outnumbered those on the offensive. Seyyid Abdul Azeez and Shaikh Saleh, who had made certain of victory, then retired wrth their discomfited force, which had lost in the attack about 100 killed and 150 wounded, to Sharkiyeh. _ His Highness now determined to make use of the large body of Arabs who had responded to his call for assistance, of whom there were now about 3,000 in the town, and des patched an expedition into the Semail valley to chastise the two disloyal Ghaffiree tribes who la been the primary cause of these disorders and who had assisted Shaikh Saleh in his inva- tlie COmraand of Se yy id Feysal-bin-Toorkee, and soon brought idabiyeen and Rehbiyeen to submission, after punishing them by cutting down part of wldv Ma^wll' h i T der instrUctions £rom tlie Sul tan, then marched to the y Ma Awal, where he reduced that tribe, which had long been disaffected, to sub-RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 18S3 -84. 19 mission also, and brought the Shaikh a prisoner to Muscat. The repulse of the rebel force from Muscat and the subsequent operations of Seyyid FeysaFs expedition have completely restored His Highness Seyyid Toorkee^s prestige and have had a tranquillizing effect on the country. The Political Agent proceeded on tour to the Kooria Mooria islands and Dhofar on the 7th November and returned to Muscat on the 26th in H, M. S. 'Philomel. In November Shaikh Bargash, the Temeemeh of the Beni Ghat fir tribe, and a man of some importance, was murdered at Bahila by his two brothers, who stabbed him while he was asleep and then seized the fort. Notwithstanding his late reverse Shaikh Saleh did not desist from in triguing among the tribes and endeavouring to organise another rising against the Sultan. He tried first with the Hejrieen, and then with the Beni Boo Hassan, but failed to induce them to engage in hostilities, and he has since remained tolerably quiet. In February some disturbances arose in Jaalan and a conflict took place between the Beni Boo Hassan and Beni Uasib tribes, in which five men were slain. By the Sultan's intervention a. truce was subsequently effected between the parties. Shaikh Nasir-bin-Mohammed-el Ma' Awalee, who had been confined by the Sultan at Muscat since his seizure by Seyyid Fey sal, was released in this month on payment of arrears of taxes due by him and by a ransom of 8,000 dollars. He was then allowed to return to his country. On the I7th March Shaikh Rashid-bin Hameyd pf the Beni Ghaffir was murdered at Bahila by his brother, Nasir. Four months before, thtse two had treacherously killed their elder brother, Bargase, and now the youngest, being eager to get sole possession of the chieftainship and family property, had taken the opportunity to put the second brother out of the way by shooting him in the back while the}'' were riding together. In this month the Bedouins of Dahireh raided part of the Batineh and carried off a quan tity of booty. Official changes. —In April 1883 Major E.

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF THE LATE SEYYID SA'EED-BIX-SULTAN IMAM OF MUSCAT, BY LIEUTENANT-COLONEL S. B. MILES. The sudden and premature termination of the career of the Ruler of ''Oman, Sultan-bin- Ahmed in November 1804, after a reign of ten years, was a calamity to his country. An able and sagacious politician, and strong enough to maintain fair order among his turbulent people he was well qualified to guide his country through the troublous times on which it had fallen' and, usurper though he was, he had come to be universally recognised by all parties as their fittest leader. His death was a signal for rivalries and intestine disorders of all kinds, which, after a struggle of three years' duration, were to result in the power falling to the youngest of the many claimants. According to the Arab custom the succession to Chieftainship is ruled by the interests and requirements of the people, rather than by the individual rights of members of the family in which the dignity may be hereditary. This leads to disputed successions, and it usually happens that the longest sword elects the prince. On this occasion the question was complicated by the recency of the dynasty Barel thirty years had elapsed since the founder had died, leaving a number of descendants, each of whom could fairly claim, as each doubtless deemed himse; l he fittest for the succession. The situation of the various aspirants to power was briefly as follows : The Imam Ahmed-bin-Sa'eed had left seven sons, of whom Hilal, the eldest, was already dead, having succumbed to the climate of Sind some years before, leaving a son named Ali, now about thirty years of age. The second and now eldest surviving son, Sa'eod, had been elected Imam on the death of his father in 1775, but, having become unpopular and almost imbecile had resigned power to his son Hamed, on whose death in 1792 it had been usurped bv Sultan' Ka.s, the third son, had been appointed Wali of Sohar by his father, an appointment which had been confirmed by Sa eed. Being the most active and ambitious of Ahmed's surviving child ren he took up arms immediately on hearing of Sultan's death, and was first in the field. Seyf the fourth son had died in Africa, leaving a son named Bedr, who had rebelled against Us uncle Sultan, and who was now to become for a time the de facto ruler Talib thp - ssl ' *• i — ™ s ~ The youngest of the competitors were the children of Sultan, of whom, the eldest Salim was now barely fifteen, and as they had nothing in their favour but the prestige actiW their father and the possession of Muscat, which had been made by Sultan the cfpSn place of Rostak, their chances of success were by no means promising.

Seyf then retired to Lamoo, where he died. Bedr appears to have inherited his father's stem and ambitious character. No sooner had he reached manhood than he imitated his schemes. In 1803, while Sultan was absent on pilgrimage, Bedr entered Muscat in disguise, and endeavoured by stratagem to get possession of Fort Jelali: the plot, however, was discovered by a Baman, who reported it to the Wali, and Bedr fled to Zobara, where he put himself under the protection of the Wahabees and embraced their tenets. He proceeded subsequently to El-Derayeh to obtain aid from the Amir against Sultan, and, on his return from Nejd with a promise of support, heard of Sultan's death and received the invitation from Salim and his ad visers to join them at Muscat. Bedr, feeling confident that if he could once make good his foot ing in Muscat he would be able, eventually, to supplant his cousins, and secure the supremacy without incurring the risk and unpopularity of an open contest for power under Wahabee auspices, eagerly accepted the proposal and set out for 'Oman. He arrived at a critical juncture. Kais was strengthening his position, and the hopes of Sultan's sons were growing fainter and fainter^ when Bedr's energy came to their aid and reversed the situation. Bedr at once called in his friends the Wahabees, and the Wahabee leader, willing to facilitate the accession to power of Bedr in the hope that he would thus become bound to them more closely, despatched a force against Sohar. This diversion had its intended effect. Kais was compelled to make terms with Bedr and hasten home. The conditions were that Kais should withdraw his claims to sovereignty and retain as his share Khaliooreh and part of the Batineh as additions to his appenage of Sohar. The peace proved a hollow affair, and was but of short duration. A month later Kais found a pretext to renew hostilities and marched on Muscat, which he captured and plundered. He was unable, however, to retain his position there, and, fearing the approach of Ghaffiree reinforce ments to Bedr, was glad to retire with the addition of Mattrah to his former acquisitions, and an allowance of one thousand dollars a month. By this time the rivalship of the other uncles and cousins had melted away before the vigorous measures of Bedr, and Kais alone remained to contend with him for supremacy in the field. Before a year had elapsed Bedr had clearly made himself master of the situation in 'Oman and had begun to show his hand as regards his designs against his young cousins, Salim and Sa'eed, whom he had in fact already excluded from Muscat by sending Salim as Wali to Mesna'ab and Sa'eed to Barka. Bedr's designs in all probability were not penetrated by Salim, who seems to have accepted his position con tentedly enough, but the more subtle and ambitious Sa'eed winced at the way in which he had been set aside and harboured revenge. On the death of Sultan advantage had been taken of the general confusion occasioned by the disputed succession by Moolla Hoossein-el Maeeni, Shaikh of Kishm, to assault and capture Bunder Abbass, and, his hands being free for the time, Bedr now sailed for that port with the object of recovering it. Captain Seton, the British Resident in the Gulf, who had been engaged in blockading the Kowasim pirates, accompanied him with two armed vessels, and succeeded in re-establishing Bedr in possession of the place, in return for which service certain concessions were granted by Bedr to the English. This happened in the autumn of 1805, and Bedr had no sooner returned to 'Oman than he found himself again involved in hostilities with Kais. In making his third and final attempt on Muscat Kais procured the support of Moolla Hoosein of Kishni and of the Kowasim, and was allowed to occupy and plunder the outskirts of the town unopposed. Bedr pursued his old tactics of inducing the Wahabees to threaten Sohar, while the young Sa'eed raided and recovered Bidbid and Fauja. The result of the campaign was disastrous to Kais' hopes; he found he had miscalculated his strength and had no alternative but 10 purchase peace by surrendering Mattrah and his allowance, and retreating to Sohar. Since the death of Sultan, who alone had offered anything like a successful resistance to them, 'Oman had fallen into a state of subjection to the Wahabees, whose preponderating influence in the country was now complete. The payments of tribute had been forced upon Sultan, but Bedr had for his own aggrandisement submitted to further humiliations, and the 'Omanis were galled at witnessing his submission to the dictation of the Wahabee Agent at Muscat. A force of 400 mounted Wahabees had been stationed at Barka in the time of Sultan to overawe the neighbouring country, and was still maintained there, whilst, in addition, the observance of the Wahabee tenet and strict attendance at prayers were now everywhere enforced. The growing strength, pretensions, and aggressive behaviour of the Wahabees had createda wide-spread feeling of discontent and consternation in the country, and Bedr, who was looked upon by all as the chief cause of their humiliating prostration before the invaders, was very unpopular. The young Sauced had long cherished feelings of envy and resentment against Bedr, and, prompted doubtless by his associates, he resolved at length to make an effort to recover possession of Muscat and to rid himself and country of one who was now a rival and an enemy. To oppose his cousin in the field, however, was out of the question; it offered no prospect of success, and no alternative appeared to remain but assassination. Mohammed-bin- Nasir El Jabri was the person to whom Sa'eed naturally turned for aid in the affair, and it was proposed that Mohammed should proceed to Muscat and dispose of Bedr as he best could. Mohammed, however, was fearful of incurring the vengeance of the A1 Bu Sa'eedis, and declined the enterprise, but he did not refuse to assist in arranging the plot that led to the tragedy of Bedr's death. There are four or five versions of this transaction, and no two Arabs agree in the details, but it seems clear that Bedr was enticed to Barka, and was attacked by Sa'eed during an interview at Na'aman, a village about 4 miles distant. Supported by Mohammed Nasir and his guard, Sa'eed stabbed Bedr, who defended himself bravely and managed to escape from the house, but was overtaken and slain. The Wahabee force at Barka were indignant at the murder and demanded the punishment of the offenders, and Sa eed was mean and ungrateful enough to throw the blame on Mohammed Nasir. The Wahabees, however, were in danger of being attacked by the excited people, and deemed it prudent to quit the country and retire to Bereymee. Sa'eed immediately set sail for Muscat, sending word of the occurrence to his brother, Salim, who had remained quietly at Mesnaah, and had not been concerned in the murder. This event, which occurred in March 1807, was the turning point in Sa'eed^s career, and placed him at once above all competitors. The deed, so far from being reckoned a crime and reprobated, was applauded throughout 'Oman ; Sa^eed was recog nised and acknowledged on all sides as gifted with true Arab courage and instincts, and as one well fitted to hold the reins of power; he was hailed as the deliverer of his country from the hand of one who had turned renegade and who had been in league with their invaders. Among the first to approve the deed and acknowledge Sa^eed^s fitness to govern was Kais, who henceforward admitted his supremacy. Sa'eed was soon joined by Salim, and it was arranged that the two brothers should rule conjointly—an arrangement that was carried out with fraternal affection and without rivalry until Salim's death. Salim was now 18, having been born in 1789 ; he was of a mild and studious disposition and had little energy, but was not wanting in courage and capacity; Sa'eed was a year younger; his mother was Ghanee, a daughter of Khalfan-bin-Mohammed El Wahull Ab Bu Sa'eedi, and, besides his having thus a better title by descent than Salim, whose mother was of a different tribe, his high spirit and energetic character indicated him as more peculiarly fitted to take the lead. This he did from the first, as we shall see, and he must be looked on hereafter as the ruling spirit in the government. The first act of Sa'eed, who dreaded the vengeance of the Wahabees for the murder of their ally, was to write to the Amir Saood and exculpate himself from the suspicions that attached to him. He accused Mohammed Nasir of the crime, declared him a rebel, and requested the Wahabees' aid in attacking him. Sa'eed promised to fulfil all the engagements entered into by Bedr as to tribute, &amp;c., to receive again the Wahabee guard of 400 men at Barkah, and to observe the Wahabee tenets. This letter, which was accompanied with handsome presents, was despatched by a special messenger. The Amir Saood was not deceived by Sa'eed's words. He had been fully apprised by his agents at Muscat of the particulars of the transaction and of the part that Sa'eed had played in it. Saood, however, to conceal his intentions wrote a pacific reply, apparently accepting Sa'eed's excuses and deprecating action against Mohammed Nasir. The dynastic change and the conduct of Sa'eed appear to have been viewed with disfavour by the British authorities, and Sa'eed began to dread lest he should be left alone in the encounter which he knew was to come with the Wahabees. Sa'eed, who had been impressed by the Na o leonic wars and successes in Europe, was thus led to turn his attention to the renewaUf political relations with the French, which had been relinquished by Sultan at the request of the British Government. Since the futile mission of M. Cavaignac in the Atalanta frigate in 1803 the only intercourse had been the occasional purchase by Sultan and Bedr of En 1' h prizes captured and sold at Mauritius by the French. Sa'eed, determined on seeking French alliance, now despatched Majid-bin-Khulfan as envoy on a mission to that island to renew the relations which had formerly existed. This mission resulted in a treaty bein- concluded between Sa'eed and General DeCaen on the 15th June 1807. French influence wa' now in th« ascendant at Muscat for a brief period. In July 1808 a fresh treaty was concluded the firstRESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1883-84. 23 one not having been found satisfactory, and M. Dallons was sent to Muscat as Consular Agent. Two years later, however. Bourbon and Mauritius capitulated : English influence became again firmly and finally re-established, and the Indian Ocean remained from that date to the peace of 1815 a mare clausum to the French. By this time the audacity and power of the piratical Kowasim had increased to such an extent that they had become as great a scourge to ^Oman by sea as the Wahabees were by land and the trade of Muscat was seriously interrupted. With the object of checking them in some degree, Sa'eed, in concert with his uncle Kais, undertook an expedition against Khor Fahan, where the Kowasim had formed a piratical station. In May 1808 Sa'eed sailed with a flotilla for that fort, where he was joined by Kais, and, after a sharp conflict the fort was carried by assault and the garrison put to the sword. News of Sa'eed's arrival, however, had been rapidly carried to Ras -el-Khaimah, and Shaikh Sultan hastened to the relief of the place, where he arrived after the massacre of the garrison. He had but a small force with him, yet be easily vanquished Sa'eed's troops and compelled them to fly. Kais was killed in the fight. The troubles of Sa'eed were now gathering thick upon him. Young and inexperienced as he was for he was now only in his 19th year, he would have succumbed before the prospect of carrying on the struggle with such formidable enemies as now surrounded him, had he not been sustained by an indomitable spirit of self-reliance. The Wahabees had now arrived at the plenitude of their power. The Amir Saood had determined upon completing the conquest of 'Oman and had announced his intention of personally leading an army to Muscat. The system hitherto pursued by him in 'Oman was one of terrorism. He maintained a Political Agent at Muscat and a strong garrison at Bereymee, the frontier town of ''Oman towards Nejd, and it was from this point that his expedition started when hostilities arose. These excursions were invariably attended by ruthless massacres and barbarities, and the dread they inspired was sufficient usually to keep the whole country in a state of abject prostration. In this plight the cup of humiliation for the 'Omanis was, therefore, nearly full, but they were now threatened with yet greater evils, viz., the direct administration and occupation of the land, and the effacement of the Ibodhi doctrines in favour of those of their oppressors. The 'Oman tribes, however, Sa'eed well knew, had no intention of tamely abandoning their religion, and were ready to respond to any call he might make on them. At this time an episode occurred which enraged Sa'eed's enemies and gave the Wahabee Ameer the pretext he sought for re-opening hostilities. Shaikh Mohammed-bin-Nasir El Jabri, whom Sa'eed had denounced to Saood as the murderer of Bedr, and who was now in possession of Semail, was lured to Muscat and treacherously imprisoned. Sa'eed's object in this was the recovery of the forts of Semail and Bidbid, which he wrested from Mohammed as the price of his liberty. Bitterly resenting this treatment, Mohammed Nasir, who was now as full of animosity towards Sa'eed as he had formerly been full of loyalty and devotion, made his way to El Derayeh, where he sought the aid and protection of Saood. The latter had already, as we have seen, contemplated leading a force to act against Muscat, and now, adopting Mohammed Nasir's cause with alacrity, he despatched his best General, Mutlah El Mutairy, with the advance of his army to 'Oman. In the meantime Sa'eed had undertaken an expedition against the Kowasim pirates, and in April 1809 had set out with a fleet to Ras-el-Khaimah to act in con junction with a force from Bushire. Sa'eed's allies in the Gulf, however, failed to co-operate; his fleet became dispersed, and he was at one time in a critical situation. The Coniwaliss and another frigate, sent from India to support him, swept the Gulf and captured a number of pirates, who were taken to Bombay, only, however, to be immediately released. Sa'eed returned to Muscat, unable to boast of any satisfactory achievement. The depredations of the Kowasim upon British and Indian commerce in the Gulf had long attracted the attention of the Indian Government, and the necessity had at length been impressed on them of suppressing these piracies. A further consideration that appears to have influenced Government was the defenceless condition of 'Oman in regard to the expected Wahabee invasion, the success of which was anticipated to be injurious to British interests. An opinion prevailed that the Kowasim were urged on in their maritime outrages by the Wahabees, and it was argued that the suppression of the pirates would act as a check on their fanatical instigators. The expedition sailed from Bombay in September 1809, and was com manded by Colonel Smith. It rendezvoused at Muscat to procure the co-operation of Sa'eed, and then proceeded to Ras -el-Khaimah, which was captured and burnt, and all its war vessels destroyed. On the return of the expedition to Muscat, Sa'eed solicited the aid of Colonel Smith against Shinas and Khor Fakan, and a joint expedition sailed for the Batineh coast, where the troops landed, stormed and captured Shinas after a desperate resistance on the 4ih24 ADMINISTRATION EEPOET OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLIIICAL January 1810. During this campaign Mutlak-el-Mutairy, who had been despatched from Nejd with the advance of the Wahabee army, had arrived with Mohammed Nasir at Bereymee, from whence on hearing of the British expedition he hastened to the aid of the Kowasim at Ras-el- Khaimah. Being too late for that affair, he moved across to Shinas, which he reached just after its fall. For three days the small British force awaited the Wahabee onslaught, but Mutlak declined an engagement until Colonel Smith had embarked his troops, when he immediately attacked the 'Omanis, and with such vigour that he completely routed them. On the depar ture of the British, Sa'eed remained at Sohar, which Mutlak, after pillaging the country around and massacring the inhabitants in revenge for the attack on Shinas, began to invest. Sa'eed attempted negociations but failed; he was, nevertheless, soon able to compel Mutlak to raise the siege, and the latter then proceeded with Mohammed Nasir to Semail, which very shortly sur rendered to him. Sa'eed, returning to Muscat, strengthened the forts in the Batineh still remaining to him, but the Wahabees were expecting reinforcements and were indeed already masters of the position. In these straits he was strongly advised by the French Consul, M. Dallons, to compromise with Mutlak, but, trusting in eventual aid from Bombay, Sa^eed declined this advice. The Wahabees now raided ^Oman and harried the inhabitants at will, but Mutlak had evidently found their subjugation a tougher task than he had anticipated. On the other hand, Sa'eed's endeavours to rid the country of its foes were unavailing; his utmost efforts were only equal to maintaining his own independence. He was unable either to assume the offensive against the invaders or to contend with them in the field, and when, in April of the following year 1811, Sa'eed, after repulsing Mutlak from the walls of Muscat, ventured to give him battle in the Ma^Awal valley, he suffered a disastrous defeat. On several occasions Sa'eed sent appealing letters and envoys to the Bombay Government praying for armed intervention and support against his enemies, representing that his alliance with the British in the late campaign had incensed the Wahabees against him and made them implacable in their enmity. The request, however, was not complied with, as Government considered it impolitic to offend the Wahabees or to undertake hostilities against them. Sa'eed then turned his attention to Persia. It was arranged that his brother Salim should proceed to Fars and request aid from the Governor-General of that Province. Provided with suitable presents, Salim accordingly made his way to Shiraz, where the influence of Pishkush procured him the promised assistance of 1,500 men. Accompanied by this auxiliary force under the command of Saadi Khan, sllim icturned to Muscat early in 1812, and operations were at once renewed against the Wahabees. In the meantime Sa eed, taking advantage of the Egyptian successes over the Wahabees in Western Arabia, which had compelled the latter to concentrate their forces, despatched his cousin, Hilal-hm-Hamad, against Zohara, and El Bahrein. The expedition was partially suc- cesrful, and the W ahabee agent, AbduIla-bin-Ufeysan taken prisoner, but no advantage resulted to Sa eed. The operations undertaken against the Wahabees on the arrival of the Persian con. tingent were conducted by Sahm, who, in conjunction with Azzan-bin-Kais and Saadi Khan marc ic against the Wahabees at Nakhl and obliged them to retire to Zikki; Semail also fell • TT t00 £ar ' Salim and his IWnS were completely routed by Mutlak at Zikki and driven back to Barka.

Another General, named El Azdakah, was4 EESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1883-84. 25 appointed to succeed him and started for 'Oman, but was murdered by the way. Mutlak was then again despatched in command with orders to renew hostilities and chastise the Omanis. In the month of November 1813 Mutlak embarked on his last campaign; he marched through the Dhahireh to Sharkiyeh, intending to direct his operations against the tribes of this province. He reached, almost unopposed, the country of the Hejrieen ; but here he met with a resistance he had hardly looked for. In the first encounter Mutlak was shot in the breast by a musket ball and fell dead. The Wahabees immediately fell into disorder, became dispersed, and retreated hastily to Bereymee. Mutlak''s arms and coat-of-mail were carried to Muscat, and the dark cloud of Wahabee domination over 'Oman was scattered. The hopes of the Wahabee Amir attaining the conquest of J Oman were lost in Mutlak. To his able and dashing generalship the success of the Wahabee invasions has been chiefly due, and the Amir had no one of similar capacity to replace him. Sa^eed's fortunes were now in the ascendant; he had passed through the period of adversity, and his career henceforward, though not marked by uninterrupted success, was brilliant and prosperous. Early in 1814 the death of Azzan-bin-Kais at Mokha, while returning from pilgrimage, gave Sa'eed the possession of Sohar, and three months later the death of the Amir Saood from fever at Dereyeh was a still more decided turn of fortune's wheel in his favour. Relieved from foreio-n pressure Sa^eed's restless spirit now sent him on another expedition against Ras-el- Khaimah, the chief stronghold of the Kowasim. He succeeded in establishing Shaikh Sultan- bin-Sakar at Shargah, but the lukewarmness of his Arab allies caused the failure of the chief object of the enterprise, and, after arranging a truce for the sake of appearances, he returned to Muscat. The Ameer Abdulla, who had succeeded his father Saood, now appointed a new agent at Muscat, the reverses sustained in his wars with the Egyptians having led him to adopt a more pacific policy. Hopes of a permanent peace were entertained and negociations were opened, but they fell through owing to disputes about Eas-el-Khaimah, and hostilities with 'Oman' recommenced. The Kowasim also began to display renewed activity at sea and sent a fleet to pirate the Indian trading craft in the Gulf of 'Oman. This fleet, among other exploits, encountered the frigate Caroline of 40 guns, commanded by Sa'eed himself, off Ra- Kuryah, and nearly succeeded in carrying her by boarding ; Sa'eed was wounded by a musket ball, and escaped with difficulty to Muscat, the victorious Kowasim sailing away to the Mekran coast to continue their depredations. For some time after this Sa'eed's attention was engaged by internal disorders in the Nakhl district, where Himyar -bin-Suliman El Yaaraby, the representative of the last dynasty, had in alliance with Mohammed Nasir-el-Jabri seized the fort. Sa'eed attempted to dispossess Himyar, but was defeated in the field, and it was only by treachery that he was able ultimately to entice Himyar within his reach and put him to death. In the beginning of 1816 Sa'eed undertook a third expedition against Ras-el-Khaimah, which he blockaded for four months, but being unable to gain any success over his enemies, the Kowasim retired discomfited to Muscat. Undiscouraged by this failure, Sa'eed now determined on undertaking the conquest of the rich island of Bahrein, an object on which he had long set his heart, and on which he had for months past been engaged in making preparations. The British Resident at Bushire did his utmost to dissuade Sa'eed from this enterprise, but in vain. Sa'eed, however, was destined never to possess that island, although he continued to cherish the hope of its acquisition to the day of his death. In June the expedition sailed from Muscat and was joined by three Persian vessels from Bushire. The Omanis were landed on the island, but were attacked and defeated with great loss by the Attoobees, Sa'eed's younger brother Hamad being slain in the fio-ht. Chagrined at his ill-success, which was due in great measure to the treachery of his allies, Sa'eed sailed away to Congoon, to embark a Persian force that had been promised him, but he fortunately discovered in time that he was being led into snare by the Persians, who intended to carry him a prisoner to Shiraz, and, abandoning his project against Bahrein, returned to 'Oman, It was at this time that Ibrahim Pasha, at the head of the Egyptian army, was marching across Arabia, intent on accomplishing the final destruction of the Wahabee Empire. The Ameer Abdulla had need of every available man to aid in the defence of his country, and not only was every Nejdian soldier withdrawn from 'Oman, but the Arab spirit of clannishness, or perhaps the ingrained hatred of Arab against Turk, induced a large contingent from the Ghaffiree, or Maaddie, tribes of El Dhahireh to flock to the standard of the Ameer at Dereyeh. In September 1817 communications were received from the French Governor of Bourbon, proposing a renewal of commercial relations between that island and Muscat, and a favourable3 I ADMINISTEATION HBPOKT OF THE PERSIAN GOTE POLITICAL IZSXZ SPSS- - - '' b «—f ''' ' ,, Durin' this year 1817, and the next, Sa'eed was entirely occupied with interna isor ers 0 with his naval enemies, the Kowasim. who attacked and made themselves masters o£ Khor Fakan. Later on, however, the fall of Dereych canscd great alar mat RaVel- and in contending Khaimah, and the Kowasim, dreading the approach of the Egyptians, became anxions to make am alliance with Sa'ccd against them. Sa'eed was too well advised, however, to entertain snch a proposition. The reign of piracy in the Gulf was now doomed. For twenty years the Kowasim. notwithstanding the efforts of British cruisers, had maintained the sway of rapine ™aritime commerce, but the patience of the Indian Government was at length exhausted. At the close of 1819 the British expeditionary force under Sir W. G. Keir arrived at Muscat, when Sa eed offered to supplement it by a land force of 4,000 men and three ships of war. This was accepted by the General, and Sa'eed accompanied tlie expedition to Ras-el-Kliaimah, where the Commander was successful in completely breaking the power of the pirate chiefs and in arranging by treaty for the future good order and tranquillity of the whole Gulf. A few months later a joint expedition was undertaken by the British and by Sa eed against the Beni Boo Ali tribe in Jaalan, the immediate cause of which, so far as the British were concerned, was the murder of the interpreter of the Mercury brig, which had been de- spatched to El Askhara to enquire into certain piratical acts committed by the tribe. On the termination of his operations General Keir had left a force in the Gulf as a temporary mea sure to ensure the observance of his treaties and to preserve order, larts of this foice, consist ing of six companies of Native Infantry and six guns, was now embaiked by the Political Agent, Captain Thompson, who had resolved on immediate hostilities, and taken fiom Kishno to Muscat. Sa'eed had for some years been at variance with the Beni Boo Ali tribe on account of their having coalesced with the ^\ahabees and adopted their tenets in 1811, and he had since been seeking for an opportunity to crush them. The expedition was undoubtedly due in part to Sa'eed's instigation and encouragement, and he had been allowed to join it with about 1,000 men. Captain Thompson sailed from Muscat to Soor, and the combined force marched from that port to the Beni Boo Ali country on the 1st November 1820. The tribes were summoned to surrender, practically unconditionally, by Sa'eed,but refused to give up their arms, and a con test ensued, in which the British force was completely defeated with a loss of 6 officers, 270 men, and all the guns. The survivors retreated by way of Sharkiyeh and 'Oman through the Wady Akk to Muscat, where they arrived on the 17th November. Sa'eed displayed great gal lantry and coolness throughout the affair, and was wounded while endeavouring to save a British soldier. In acknowledgment of his services a sword of honour was presented to him by the Governor General. To retrieve this disaster, a large force was despatched under General Sir Lionel Smith from Bombay in January 18*21. The General attacked Beni Boo Ali in March, and after severe fighting destroyed the forts and almost annihilated the tribe, which to this day has never recovered its former strength and prestige. Sa'eed was not permitted to take part in this campaign, though he personally accompanied the troops. It was during his absence from Muscat on this occasion that he had to mourn the death of his elder brother Salim, who died of paralysis in February 1821. A large number of prisoners of the Beni Boo Ali were carried to Bombay by General Smith, where they were detained for about two years, and were then released and sent back to 'Oman. By order of the Court of Directors intercession was made with Sa'eed on behalf of the survivors of the tribe, for forgiveness and permission to return to their country. This intercession on the part of the British Government roused Sa'eed's jealousy and suspicion, and, though he yielded after some hesitation, it was only with a bad grace. In 1822 Captain F. Moresby, R.N., Her Majesty's ship Minai, was ordered to Muscat to conclude a treaty with Sa'eed for the suppression of the slave trade. Sa'eed granted all the concessions asked for, which would, if strictly enforced, have caused him a loss of £5,000 or £6,000 a year. Relieved from all troubles, foreign and domestic, and feeling that he had securely consoli dated his power, Sa'eed now undertook a pilgrimage to Mecca. He appointed his nephew, Mohammed-bm-Salim, Regent during his absence and sailed in the Liverpool seventy-four, which had been specially repaired for the voyage in Bombay, in March 1824. This journey was performed with great pomp and magnificence, and was most costly to Sa'eed. The Pasha of Egypt, Mohammed Ah, sent officers to meet him, and nothing was omitted by them and the Turkish Governor to give Sa'eed a fitting reception on his arrival at Jeddah. On his journeyRESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1883-84. 27 to Mecca and Medina lie was accompanied by a large escort and entertained witli great sumptnousness. He created everywhere an immense sensation, and his popularity among the people was not lessened by the generosity of his gifts. Notwithstanding his being Akharejite or dissenter, Sa^eed was received with the greatest respect and honour by the Shereef, and on his departure was presented with splendid gifts by Mohammed Ali. Sa'eed was received on his return to Muscat with loud acclamations, and the rejoicings lasted several days. In July 1826 Sa^eed sent a fleet to blockade Bushire in the absence of the Governor, Shaikh Abdul Russool, though, at the request of the Resident, he refrained, from attacking the town. The Shaikh himself was captured at sea on his way home shortly after and detained a prisoner until the following year, when he paid a ransom of 80,000 dollars and agreed to surrender a Persian princess, a sister of Reza Kolee Mirza, who had been promised to Sa'eed, but had been delayed at Bushire by the Governor, who was desirous of marrying her himself. In November of the same year Sa'eed, having been unable to prevail on the Govern ment of Busra to pay the stipulated subsidy, the arrears of which had amounted to 104,000 dollars, equipped a fleet to enforce his demand. In an engagement that ensued the Turks were defeated and the Pasha carried prisoner to Muscat. Busra was blockaded until the Turks made terms. The following year was spent by Sa'eed in a fruitless war with Bahrein, for which he had made long and expensive preparations. With the object of taking the Uttoobees by surprise, Sa^eed contradicted the rumours prevalent of his intentions, and assured the Shaikh of his pacific feelings until about a month before he arrived there with his fleet, which was in Novem ber 1828. In his attack on the island, however, his force was completely routed and many slain, while he himself was slightly wounded. Being thus discouraged in his enterprise, he abandoned its further prosecution and returned to Muscat. A peace was concluded between the belligerents on terms not unfavourable to Sa'eed in December the following year. In 1829 the Chief of Dhofar, Mohammed Akil, was murdered at Morbah, and Sa'eed imme diately despatched a force to take possession of that district. This force only remained a few months for Sa'eed, having done with Bahrein, prepared to visit his East African possessions in order to conquer the district and island of Mombasa, and with this object withdrew the troops from Dhofar. Having appointed his nephew, Mohammed-bin-Salim, Regent, and treacherously seized and imprisoned his cousin Hilal, with a view to keep him out of mischief, he sailed for Mom basa accordingly on the 15th December. The importance of this part of Sa'eed's dominions, which was to occupy his chief attention for the next 15 years, and was to be selected shortly as his permanent residence, will be our apology for taking a short retrospect of the state of affairs there. East Africa had been occupied by the Omani Arabs for many centuries; they had succeeded the Persians in the domination of the salient points of trade on that coast, and had been in their turn supplanted by the Portuguese. Without going back to those times to observe the wave of history, it will suffice to commence our retrospect from the peiiod at which the decadence of the Portuguese led to the re-assumption by the Arabs of their supremacy at Mombasa. About the year 1655 A.D, the Imam Sultan-bin-Seif, at the solicitation of a deputation of the inhabitants, who were tired o£ the tyrannical rule o£ the Portuguese, sent a fleet to besiege the place. After a siege of five years he succeeded in expelling the Portuguese and appointed a Governor. The Portuguese, however, soon recovered possession of Mombasa and retained it until 1696 or 1698 A.D., when an Arab fleet, despatched by the Imam Seyf-bin-Sultan, ao-ain expelled the Portuguese from Mombasa; the success of the Arabs being followed by a general attack on, and massacre of, the Portuguese along the coast at Kilwa, Pemba, Patta, Zanzibar, and other places. Affairs at home, however, precluded the Imam and his successors from interfering with East Africa, and Mombasa was left to take care of itself until the year 1728, when the Portuguese Admiral, Luis de Sampaio, appeared with his fleet and again brought the whole coast under subjection to his sovereign. Finding the tyranny of the Portuguese insupportable, the inhabitants soon renewed their solicitations to Oman for deliver ance, and a small fleet was accordingly despatched to their aid. But in the meantime, having found an opportunity, the inhabitants rose and massacred their oppressors, so that the Arab deputed by the Imam to assist in expelling the Portuguese had nothing to do but to quietly assume the position of Governor. This man was Mohammed-bin Sa eed El Maamiie. For the first time an Arab garrison was placed at Zanzibar by this W ali, who appears to have remitted a small annual tribute to 'Oman. In 1739 the then Wali of Mombasa, Saleh- bin-Sa'eed El Hadrami, was succeeded by Moliammed-bin- ; Othman El Mezrm. Mohammed is 4 A28 ADMINISTRATION EEPOET OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL a noteworthy character; for he was the founder of what may be ca led the Mezen. Dynasty on the east coast, and his claim to be independent of the A1 Bu Sa eedis can hard y be said to be relinquished by his descendants to this day. Mohammed was a just and able ruler, and soon gained the respect of the people of Mombasa. Two years later a change of dynasty occurred in 'Oman, the rule being transferred from the Yaareby tribe to the A1 Bu Sa eedis. This opportunity was seized by Mohammed ; Othman to declare himself independent. To put down this revolt against his authority the Imam, Ahmed-bin-Sa'eed, sent one Seyf-bin Khalaf, to assassinate &amp; Mohammed 'Othman and seize the government in Ahmed's name. Seyf was so far successful that he murdered Mohammed and took possession of the fort, but Moham med's brother, Ali-bin-'Othman, escaped from Seyfs hands, and, with the aid of Mr. Cook an English merchant, and some native allies, recovered the fort and government, and decapitated Seyf-bin-Khalaf. This occurred in the year 1745, and Ali-bin-'Othman maintained his inde pendence till his death,—Magdesho, Brava, and Samoo remaining as his dependencies. Kilwa, Marka, and Zanzibar, however, submitted to the Imam, and the latter island received its first (iovernor, under the new dynasty, in Abdulla-bin-Jaad A1 Bu Sa'eedi. A few years later, Ali-bin-'Othman undertook an expedition against Zanzibar, where he was murdered by his relative, Mesood-bin-Nasir, who then usurped the government of Mombasa. Mesood died in 1774, and was succeeded by Abdulla Mohammed, who died in 1782. Meanwhile, the Imam Ahmed did not interfere in East African politics, nor did his son and successor Sa'eed, until the expedition of his younger brother Seyf in 1784, when the Imam Sa'eed sent his son Hamad, with a fleet, to follow up Seyf and frustrate his intentions. Hamud, after raising the siege of Zanzibar, went to Mombasa, where he obtained a written acknowledgment of the suzerainty of the Imam, and then returned to 'Oman. East Africa then remained unmolested by Muscat for many years; Sultan was too much engaged in dealing with the Wahabees and with internal troubles to have leisure for distant campaigns, and for some years Sa'eed was similarly occupied. Sa'eed's first attempt at interference was in 1812, when he sent a Wali named Khalaf-bin-Nasir, and built a fort at Lamoo. Ahmed-bin- Mohammed died in 1814, and was succeeded by his son Abdulla, a brave and enterprising Chief, who, resolving to separate from the mother-country, refused to send any tribute to Muscat. Being conscious, however, that this course would inevitably lead to a contest^ Abdulla sailed to Bombay, and endeavoured to secure the alliance of the Indian Government. Some time later, in 1817, intestine broils at Patta, the suzerainty over which was claimed by the Wali of Mombasa, compelled one of the parties to call in the aid of Sa'eed. A small force, under Abdul Ali, was sent from Muscat, which established Bwana Shaikh as Sa'eed's vassal. The Wali of Mombasa, however, soon recovered his predominating influence, and matters so remained until fresh dissensions arose, when Sa'eed again was invited to interfere, and, burning with jealousy against the Mezeri Chief, sent a second expedition in 1882, under Hamad-bin-Ahmed, who received the submission of Brava, Patta, and Siwi, while Sa'eed's Wali at Zanzibar, hearing of Hamud's proceedings, seconded him by attacking Pemba and expelling the Mombasa garrison. Abdulla- bin-Ahmed died 1823, and, as the succession was disputed, the people elected Suliman-bin-Ali, the ex-Wali of Pemba, to act as Regent temporarily. Sa'eed was at this time getting ready another fleet at Muscat, and had issued orders that his people were not to trade with Mombasa—a measure which, in connection with the recent loss of Pemba, the source of its food supply, did much to weaken Suliman's position. Apprehensive of the result of a contest with Muscat, tSuliman-bin-Ali had written to the Government of Bombay, soliciting protection, but no answer was received to this appeal. It appears, however, that in December 1823 the English sloop Barracouta, one of the vessels engaged in the East African survey, anchored off Mombasa. Her arrival was hailed with great delight, and earnest solicitations were made to Captain \ idal by the Wali Suliman and the inhabitants to take the island under British pro tection. This request Captain Vidal decided to refuse, but he offered to transmit their applica- tion to the British Government. A few days after the Barracouta had left, the Muscat flotilla sailed into port and immediately commenced the blockade. Suliman-bin-Ali hoisted the British flag, trusting by it to deter Abdulla-bin-Suleyyim, the Commander of the expedition, from his designs. Matters were in this state, and the flag was still hoisted when the Leven ga ®. o Februar J' 1S21 ' A application was immediately made for protection by the Wall to Captain Owen, who, taking a different view from that of his subordi- nate, Captain Vidal, agreed to a convention accepting the sovereignty over Mombasa from Mehndi to Pangam on the part of England on condition of the abolition of slavery. The Arab Commander Abdnlla-bm-Suleyyim, at once placed himself under the orders of Captain Owen and agreed to pve up the blockade. Captain Owen appointed one of his officers.

Captain Owen revisited the coast in January 18£5, when the people of Brava also solicited British protection, which was accorded to them He then made an arrangement with the Wali at Zanzibar that no interference should take place on the Wali's part with the East African coasts until the decision of Govern ment became known. In 1826 Suliman-bin-Ali was deposed by Salim, the brother of the late Wali, Abdulla- bin-Ahmed, the British Governor not interfering in the matter, and shortly after the Home authorities,'at the instance of the Indian Government, disavowed Captain Owen's proceedings, and the British Commandant was removed from Mombasa, which was left with Pemba and Brava to settle its own quarrel with Sa'eed. Sa'eed lost no time in writing to Salim and sum- monino- him to surrender. Salim in reply offered to acknowledge a nominal sway and to remit tribute, but refused to yield the fort. This did not satisfy Sa'eed, who, having completed his preparations, sailed in the Liverpool with a large fleet and 1,200 men from Muscat, expectant of an easy victory. The sight of this imposing force riding at anchor before his little island did not terrify Salim; he refused defiantly Speed's demand for submission, and declined to accept his invitation to an interview. He was prepared for defence. A general assault was then made by Sa'eed, but it was repulsed with heavy loss, and after several ineffectual attempts Sa'eed deemed it prudent to raise the siege and retire to Zanzibar. In the meanwhile serious disorders were taking place in 'Oman. Incensed at her brother's imprisonment, Jokha, the sister of Hilal, seized the fort at Soweyk and razed the Batineh. Hamud also joined in the insurrection, made himself master of Sohar, Khabooreh, and Shinas, and prepared to march on Muscat.' Mohammed-bin-Salim, seriously alarmed, sent a vessel to recall Sa'eed from Zanzibar and appealed to Bombay for help. Two cruisers were ordered to support him and to prevent an attack being made on Muscat. The Resident also kept other vessels ready and warned Hamud not to attempt an attack. Sa'eed returned to 'Oman in May 1830, and with his usual duplicity pretended to think that the rebellion had been of an insignificant character, and that he had been recalled without reason. He was unable, however, to recover either Sohar or Khabooreh from Hamud, and had to content himself with the restitution of Shinas. Another expedition against Sohar, in February 1831, was undertaken by Sa eed, but he was disastrously defeated by Hamud with a loss of 400 or 500 men, and had to retreat with his finances and reputation reduced to a very low ebb. Early in the next year Sa'eed having entrusted the government of 'Oman to his eldest son Hilal, his nephew, Mohammed-bin-Salim, and Saood-bin-Ali of Barka, set out on a fresh expedition to East Africa in the Liverpool with the intention of again besieging Mombasa. His force consisted of 1,400 men in four ships and six bughlos, and, having on arrival wasted three days in fruitless negociations, commenced to bombard the town and forts. This proved unavailing, and negociations were again resorted to Salim, on receiving hostages, came on board the Liverpool, and a convention was concluded to the effect that Salim should recognise Sa'eed's sovereignty, and should continue to hold the governorship as hereditary in his family, that he should also hold and reside in the fort, which was however, to be garrisoned by 50 men, appointed by Sa'eed, and that the .customs should be equally divided between Sa'eed and Salim. Sa'eed then entered and formally took possession of the fort, and appointed Sa 'eed-bin-Khalfan as Akeed, or Commandant. Instead of 50, however, he introduced a garrison of 200 men, and then peifidiously ordered Salim to quit the fort and reside in the town. Before leaving, he repaired the fort and stationed a garrison of 350 men, Beloochis and Arabs, in it, and then set sail for Zanzibar. Sa'eed appears to have already resolved to fix his residence at Zanzibar, for he began to build a palace at Metony and to lay out clove and rice plantations. Bat he was not destined to enjoy tranquillity there long. He had, in fact, no sooner left Muscat than disturbances of a serious character broke out, and the integrity of his dominions was threatened. These disturb ances were due chiefly to harem intrigues, and to the existing jealousy between Saood-bin-Ali and Mohammed -bin-Salim. Taking advantage of the arrival of Hilal and Mohammed at Barka, whither they had proceeded en route to Bostak, which had been made over to Hilal, Saood seized and imprisoned the pair, and then laid siege to Mesnaah. Hamud-bin-Azzan, Hilalbin- Mohammed, and Sultan-bin-Sakar also took up arms, the last seizing Khor Fakan and Dibba, and the two former beleaguering Rostak. The Seyyideh Moza took the lead on Sa'eed 's part, and was joined by Talib and Mohammed Nasir El Jabri, with 1 ,500 Ghaffiris, at Muscat, while the Beni Naeem at their request made a diversion against Sohar. To support Sa'eed's rule the Resident at Bushire wrote warning letters to the insurgent, and despatched hisADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL T, i « 0 in Muscat but in the meantime Saood had released his prisoners ^ - ivai of the B t a d f ood withdrew his pretensions and exculpated himself by saymg he had only acted m self-defence. The quelling of this rebellion and the restoration of tranquillity was attributed solely to the pion.pt support afforded to Speed's authority by the British Government, which encouraged and brouo-ht forward Sa^eed^s friends, while it effectually checked and dismayed the insurgents. His rule In recent years had led, it was said, to the formation of a very unfavuorable esti mate of the situation of Sa^eed, and it was clear that British influence alone had prevented his immediate downfall. Sa^eed returned from Zanzibar on the 10th September 1833, and^ after appointing Saood to Rostak on condition of his giving up Barka, solicited aid in re- covering Khor Fakan and Dibba, but this was refused by Government, and he was advised to remain at home in future and protect his Arabian dominions. Sa^eed when starting from Zanzibar had ordered Hamud-bin-Ahmed, the Wali of Zanzibar, to reduce Magdesho with the Mombasa fleet. Hamud accordingly bombarded and sacked that town, which then sub mitted. Abdulla -bin-Surveylime was killed on this occasion. His old loes, the W ahabees^ had by this time again turned their attention towards 'Oman, and much anxiety was created in Sa'eed's mind by their attitude. He was not in a position to offer any effectual resistance to their encroachments, and, under the advice of the British authorities, deemed it his best policy to enter into friendly relations with them. He accordingly agreed to pay them an annual subsidy of 5,000 dollars on condition of the integrity of his dominions being respected. A stipulation was also made that each party should assist the other in quelling rebellions in their respective countries, but this latter engagement was considered impolitic and was dis approved of by the British as leading to possible embarrassments. The arrival at Muscat at this time of the United States sloop-of-war Peacock with Mr. Roberts, who had been appointed Plenipotentiary to negociate a treaty of amity and com merce with the kingdom of 'Oman, was a notable event in the life of Sa'eed. The growing importance of Muscat and Zanzibar as commercial depots had begun to attract foreign mer chants, and improvements in the customs regulations soon became a necessity. The chief part of the trade and customs farm was still, as it had been for centuries, in the hands of Indian traders, whose position was well known and assured, and in whose favour no cause had arisen for England to interfere. The American merchants, however, were in a different position. They had only begun to trade at Zanzibar some ten or twelve years before, and the heavy exactions and constant annoyances to which they were subjected by the Customs House farmer and Indian traders, who were jealous of interlopers, compelled them to make representa tions to their Governments, which thus took the lead in entering into engagements with 'Oman to remove grievances and place its commerce on a secure and satisfactory basis. The treaty which was concluded in September 1833 was of a comprehensive character and well considered in its details, and formed the prototype on which the English and French treaties were subsequently drafted. Sa'eed's engagements with foreign powers had heretofore been confined to conventions with British India and French colonies, and it was with unconcealed pride and gratification that he now for the first time found himself placed on a level with the rulers of civilised States, and, though the capitulations he had bound himself to observe complicated his foreign relations, the treaty, as he probably foresaw and understood, had the effect of raising his position and increasing the trade and prosperity of his country. It was not in accordance with Sa'eed's character that he should allow the opportunity to slip without intriguing to gain some advantage for himself, and, as the conquest of Mombasa was the matter now uppermost in his mind, he offered to allow the Americans to erect fac tories where they pleased, at Zanzibar or on the East African coast, on condition of their rendering him armed assistance in the prosecution of his plans. It does not appear that the United States Government reciprocated Sa'eeds' views, nor is it likely they would have con sented to engage in such an enterprise, but the news of the proposal was received in India with the reverse of pleasure, and Her Majesty's ship Imogene was soon despatched to observe the state of affairs. Captain Hart reached Zanzibar in 1834 and was able, not only to frustrate the proposed scheme, but to obtain Sa'eed's consent to the negociation of a similar treaty with England. To return to Africa: Sa'eed had no sooner quitted Zanzibar in August 1832 than a rup ture broke out at Mombasa, the result of which was the restoration of Mezeni independence Sa'eed had instructed the Wali of Pemba, Nasir-bin-Sultan El Meskeri, a bitter enemy of the Mezemt, to proceed to Mombasa and assume the Waliship from Salim. In this demand heEESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1883-84. 31 was supported by the Commandant of the garrison, for whom he had probably brought written orders. Salim, however, refused to submit to this violation of the treaty, and ordered Nasir to quit the place in 24* hours. Nasir then shut himself up in the fort and commenced to bombard the town, which had no means of replying. The whole population, however, siding with Salim, blockaded the fort and cut off the supplies, and the garrison, being at length reduced to extremities, were compelled to capitulate after a siege of 7 months. The command ant and his men were allowed to leave Mombasa unmolested, but Nasir was detained and kept in irons. An abortive attempt to relieve the place was made by Sauced, who sent Hamud-bin- Ahmed in the S/m/i Allum to assist Nasir, but he arrived too late. It was not until about November 1833 that Sa'eed, having arranged terms with the Wahabee General, Sa ; eed-bin-Mutlak, was able to devote his energies to the reconquest of Mombasa. Having appointed Howeynee his Deputy at Muscat, he set sail in the Rahmanee with the Liverpool (seventy-four), two corvettes and 1,400 men, and anchored off Mombasa Fort. Salim and the Mezinis, fearing the vengeance of Nasir, should the latter ever gain power over them, strangled him in prison, and Sa'eed, enraged at this action, immediately commenced a bombardment. His attacks, however, were repulsed by the Mezinis, who captured and destroyed twobughlos, and Sa'eed, after 8 days' ineffectual warfare, had recourse to negociations. Sa'eed pretended to regret his precipitate hostilities, and proposed peace on the basis of the former treaty. This was accepted by Salim, who agreed to acknowledge Sa'eed's sovereignty, but made proviso that the citadel was not to be occupied by Sa'eed's men. Sa'eed induced two of Salim's relatives to accompany him, and, with this appearance of victory, he proceeded to Zanzibar in triumph. Soon after Sa'eed sent an expedition against Siwi, which had revolted. Salim assisted the people of Siwi, and Sa'eed was defeated with immense loss. At Patta and Siwi, again, further ao-oressive movements were equally unsuccessful. Sa'eed's stay at Zanzibar was again of short duration. His ambitious schemes had no sooner led him to distant shores than intestine troubles at home recalled him to restore order. The mar-peace on this occasion was Hamud-bin-Azzan, who, taking advantage of the murder of Saood-bin-Ali by his cousin Sultan-bin-Ahmed, marched on Rostak and took it, and then prepared to attack Semail, the Wali of which, Mohammed Nasir El Jabri, had lately died. It was feared that Hamud by the acquisition of these forts might be in a position to overawe and seize Muscat, and the British Resident, therefore, in July 1834, with a view to support Sa'eed's government and authority, moved down to Muscat and informed Hamud that his persistence in rebellion would lead to his being considered an enemy of the British Government. This intervention was effective in checking Hamud's designs for a time, but a few months later his irrepressible ambition prompted him to take up arms again and seize Soweyk, from which fort, however, he was very quickly dislodged by a force despatched from Muscat. Hamud's popularity in the country, nevertheless, continued to increase, and, although Howeynee called in the Kiowasim and the Beni Yas tribes to his aid, he was able to effect nothing against his cousin until the return of Sa'eed from Zanzibar in April 1835. Sa'eed immediately took the field and proceeded against Sohar, but, although this expedition returned with only a bare semblance of success, his presence at home was sufficient to re-establish his authority and put an end to Hamud's hostilities. Affairs in 'Oman for some time occupied Sa'eed's attentions, but, although pining to return to Zanzibar, he was fearful to leave Muscat while Hamud was unsubdued, as the latter would be certain to take immediate advantage of his absence. Sa'eed therefore, in 1836, entered into an arrangement with Sa 'eed -bin-Mutlak to unite in expelling Hamud from Sohar and Rostak. Sa'eed-bin-Mutlak accordingly besieged Sohar by land with 2,000 men, while Sa'eed despatched a fleet and blockaded it by sea. Hamud's position was getting desperate, when he succeeded in arousing Sa'eed's suspicions as to the intentions of the Wahabees, and Sa'eed, hastily abandoning the enterprise, returned to Muscat. Soon after this a vessel of the Indian Navy, under instructions from Government, who were desirous of promoting a recon ciliation between Sa'eed and Hamud, proceeded to Sohar, and, having received Hamud on board, returned to Muscat, where a written engagement was entered into by the latter that he would not again rebel against Sa'eed or enter upon hostilities against Hilal-bin-Mohammed of Soweyk. ' The Wali of Mombasa, Salim-bin-Ahmed, died in March 1835, and his death was the signal for rivalry and dissensions between his brothers, Khamis and Nasir. After more than a year spent in contention the succession was obtained by Salim's son, Rashid.32 administeation kepoet of the peesian sulf political A deputation ^ in some hiv^^tion^Thastened^is^arnrng^ ^ntea'nTsTe! fromM'uscat in November 1836, arriving at Mombasa about the close of the year He at once summoned Easbid to surrender, but, recemng no reply, Sa eed landed h.s Cps and batteries on the north side of the creek and commenced a bombardment Taught bv experience, however, of the futility of this methrf, he founded h.s hopes upon mtngne and by lavish expenditure soon gained over a large proportion of those opposed to h.m, mcludmg Khamis and Nasir, the uncles of Bashid. Rashid, seemg the gradual defecfaou of h, B adherents and finding himself unable to hold out against the power of Sa eed s purse, opened neerociations, and in February 1837 a convention was concluded in the terms of the original pact by which the fort was to be garrisoned by Sa eed s men, and the Wall was to reside in the town. Sa'eed then appointed Ali-bin-Munsoor to command the fort with a garri son of 500 men, and sailed for Zanzibar. Shortly after, at Sa eed s invitation l^ashid paid a visit to Zanzibar and was then offered the Waliship of Pemba, or a liberal pension, if he would relinquish his title and claim to the Waliship of Mombasa, and quit that place with his family for ever. Rashid declined the preferred baits and maintained his hereditary claim to Mombasa, and Sa'eed failing in his attempt to get final possession of the coveted fort by purchase, devised a plan for the extermination of the family of the Mezeni Chief. Rashid was now honourably treated and sent back to Mombasa with presents. But two months later, Khalid, SaVd's second son, was despatched to that fort with secret orders which he carried out with great precision and success. On arrival at Mombasa, where he was received with due respect, Khalid landed and held a durbar in Arab fashion at the fort gate. Rashid and the other Mezenis attended the levee, and, after making their salutations, were desired to enter the fort for the discussion of business. On passing in they were seized one by one and thrown into prison to the number of 80. Suspicions then arose, the alarm spread, and the remainder of the Mezara fled to to the mainland. The prisoners were immediately put on board and carried by Khalid to Zanzibar, whence Sa'eed shipped them to Bunder Abbass in one of his frigates. Some were thrown overboard on the way, and the rest were immured and starved to death. Sa'eed's wars at Mombasa had been marked throughout by a series of perfidies, and this cruel murder of the gallant Rashid and his companions fittingly completed his conquest. With their death the Mezeni dynasty, which had lasted for over a century, and which neither the Imaum Ahmed nor any of his descendants had been able to overthrow by force of arms, came to an end. The accession of Her Majesty Queen Victoria was an opportunity for Sa^eed to display his loyalty to England, which was not neglected by him. In 1838 he despatched Ali-bin- Nasir as envoy to offer his congratulations, with presents of great value; and Captain Cogan, who brought back the mission to Zanzibar, was empowered to negociate a commercial treaty, which was concluded and signed in May 1839. Very shortly after Sa^eed received letters from the Governor at Bourbon, who had been moved by representations from French mer chants of commercial requirements at Zanzibar, requesting him to receive a French Consul on the same footing as the Americans, and making overtures for a fresh treaty. Sa'eed, how ever, demurred to granting an exequatur to the consul, who had in fact already been appoint ed in anticipation until the treaty had been concluded, and the Consulate was deferred accordingly. Sa^eed returned from East Africa to 'Oman in September 1839, and had no sooner arrived than he was forced to turn his attention to the adoption of measures for resisting the advance of the Egyptians; Mohammed Ali had at this time embarked on his vain career of aggression in Syria and Arabia, and his General, Khoorshia, had in December despatched Sa'eed-bin-Mutlak, with a large force and two guns, to Bereymee. There was reason to believe that Sa'eed had been engaged in a secret intrigue with Mohammed Ali for aid in obtaining possession of Bahrein in return for the payment of tribute to Egypt. But under the advice of the British Government Sa'eed dropped these schemes and evinced proofs of his determination to act loyally in accordance with the policy of the Government in opposing the invasion of the Egyptian troops. In one of his interviews with Mohammed Ali in April 1840, Colonel Hodges, the Consul-General at Cairo, desired explanations as to the object of the force under Sa'eed-bin- Mutlak ; professions of ignorance and evasions were at first resorted to, but the Pasha sub sequently admitted that the force was part of Khoorshid's army, and was intended for the annexation of 'Oman. He was then informed that the British Government would allow no interference on his part with 'Oman, and would punish any attempt at encroachment. ThoughEESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1883-84. 33 in bitter wrath at the frustration of his schemes, Mohammed Ali was nevertheless compelled very shortly to evacuate Arabia, and his submission to the Porte in November 1810 relieved 'Oman from any further danger in that direction. The restless activity and acquisitive propensities of the French in East African waters now greatly exercised the mind of Sa'eed; and, writing to Lord Palmerston from Zanzibar, whither he had again proceeded in the autumn of ISIO, he did not conceal his fears that that nation had aggressive designs on his mainland possession. Sa^eed's fears were probably not ill-founded. The brig Be Messager was despatched from Bourbon on three occasions to obtain concessions of different sorts, and other indications were not wanting to show that the French were anxious to obtain a footing on the coast, but Sa^eed had the sense and manliness to resist these demands and to decline to enter into any engagements against his interests. In his preposterous complaint, however, concerning the French occupation of Nosse Be, which belonged, as he averred^ to a Sakalava Queen, who bad put herself under his authority, Sa^eed was no doubt actuated by jealousy. Some seven or eight years before he had despatched a mission to Mada gascar with the double object of offering marriage to the Hova Queen and of hiring soldiers for his Mombasa campaign, and he seems then to have cherishpd the hope of becoming master of the whole or part of that vast island. His matrimonial proposals had been slighted by the Queen, who does not appear to have treated the ambassadors with particular distinction, but Sa^eed had probablv not altogether withdrawn his gaze from that quarter and did not look on the French proceedings with entire equanimity. Very soon after Sa'eed had sailed for Zanzibar, his rival Hamud-bin-Azzam of Sohar, who, to show his loyalty and amicable feelings towards Sa'eed, had lately accompanied the latter on a tour of his possessions in the Gulf, seeing in his absence a good opportunity to make another move for the supreme power, set out for Bombay to solicit the neutrality of Government in the forthcoming struggle. Though accorded a courteous reception in Bombay, the reply he received appears to have effectually discouraged him from further hostilities againt Sa J eed, and soon after his return to 'Oman he retired from public life and assumed the garb of religion, appointing, at the suggestion of the lady Moza, his son Seyf Governor of Sohar, and the since famous priest El Khalelee Governor of E-ostak. Hamud's ascetic life and patronage of the learned Khalelee led to an intrigue among the Batineh tribes to elect him Imam, but it was not generally supported and fell through. It was a mere proposal. The situation of affairs at Bahrein in 1843, where civil war had broken out, revived Sa'eed's long-cherished hopes of including that island in his dominions, and Howeynee began to make preparations at Muscat for an expedition. Before embarking on the enterprise, however, Sa'eed had the prudence to refer to Government for an expression of their views in the matter; and, as it was considered desirable that Sa'eed should, for fear of bringing on complications with the Wahabees and Persians, preserve an attitude of neutrality, the scheme was abandoned by him. 'Oman was at this time again threatened by its old enemies the Wahabees. The Ameer Feysal, having made terms with Mohammed Ali and returned to Reyadh, announced his intention of undertaking the reconquest of 'Oman. Sa'eed-bin-Mutlak was despatched to Bereymee with a large force, and a demand was at the same time made upon Thoweynee for $25,000. On receipt of this news the Resident at Bushire advised Thoweynee to maintain a friendly understanding with the Wahabees, and to accept any terms compatible with his father's dignity. Thoweynee at once requested a truce desiring time to refer to Zanzibar for orders. Sa'eed-bin-Mutlak, however, notwithstanding his compliance with the request, im mediately after marched into the Batineh and commenced hostilities. Remonstrances against this action were sent by the Resident to Feysal and to Sa eed-bin-Mutlak, and this in tervention, coupled with the fact that the 'Oman tribes were gathering in formidable numbers to oppose him, induced Sa'eed-bin-Mutlak to accept terms, and he eventually withdrew his forces for an annual tribute of $5,000, the authorization for which Thoweynee had received from Zanzibar. The invasion thus terminated in a manner more favourable to Sa'eed than might have been expected. The increasing indifference to home affairs on Sa'eed's part was exem plified on this occasion by his not returning to guide his people in their defence against aggression. He was, moreover, exhausting his resources at this time in his foolish campaign against the town of Siwi in East Africa. For this enterprise he had made extensive and costly preparations, and his force of 2,000 men was despatched in March 1844 under the command of Hamud-bin-Ahmed El Samar. It ended in a terrible disaster. The attack was badly planned, and the natives routed and almost annihilated the Arab army, killing many of the leading Shaikhs, including the commander, and capturing the whole of the artillery and stores. It was in this year that Sa'eed had the felicity to conclude his third treaty with a great power. 534 ADMINISTEATION EEPOET OF THE PEESIAN GULF POmiCAL t o a a +1 Tfi-pnr'li Commodore on the East Indian station, Captain On the ^ NoTe,nter d 1 ®f Za ^ zibar in the Crocod with a draft treaty o£ friendship atd Romajn DeS ^; ^ commu „icated the proposals of the French Government m commerce, oa eed nad pie y approval that lie consented to this matter to the English Foreign the same day the first negociate.

It was at this time that Hilal, Sa'eed's eldest son, proceeded to England to beseech the intercession of Her Majesty's Government with his 14 ^ tarn aside from political events a little and glanee at the relauons m which Sa eed stood towa.ds W son Sa'eed's family now consisted of twelve, of whom the first was Hrlal who was born 11815. He is described as tall, fair, and handsome, noted for his courage and revered by the Arabs, who deemed him the most shrewd and energetic of all the sons He was so mnch a favonrite that he would, it is said, have proved a very formidable rival to Ins father had he chosen to head a rebellion. The knowledge of this by Sa'ccd had not nnprobably something to do with the continuance of that deep-rooted dislike and avers.on which had been manifested towards Hilal from childhood. Hilal had only reached his twenty-third year when his fat er determined to disinherit him, and three years later, as the estrangement increased, Hilal who had been Wali at Barka, was recalled to Zanzibar, and was never again allowed to hold an official position. In July 1844 Sa'eed, with the express object oi finding out whether he would be upheld in disinheriting Hilal, had written to Lord Aberdeen, saying it wes his wish that Thoweynee should succeed him in 'Oman and Khalid in East Africa. The reply, however, was a diplomatic one, expressing hopes that Sa'eed would restore Hilal to favour^ The snpercession of Hilal bv his father appointing Khalid to act as Regent at Zanzibar, and Thoweynee at Muscat, during his absence from either place, was a cause of many quarrels, as Hilal was always insist- in( , 0 n the governorship of one or other of those capitals as being his by birth-right, and indignant, at length, at what he considered his father's unjust treatment of him, he proceeded to England in September 1845, to represent his condition to Her Majesty's Government. Having kept his father in ignorance of his intentions, Hilal was not accorded an official reception in London, but he seems to have gained much sympathy, and strong letters were written in his favour. Sa'eed, however, was exasperated by this visit and consequent exposure of his conduct, and, though for a time more indulgent outwardly, became really more bitter in his dislike, and in November 1849 Hilal was exiled from Zanzibar for ever. Hilal retired first to Lamoo. ^nd thence moved on to Aden, where he arrived in destitute condition; but the end was approaching, and, surrounded happily by all his family, his sad story closed on the 28th September 1851. The causes of Sa'eed's hatred of his eldest son are obscure and will probably ever remain so. Scandal rumoured that Hilal had violated his father's harem, but the story is suspicious, and it is more probable that the estrangement was due to harem intrigues and to jealousy, as Hilal's mother, an Abyssinian, died when he was an infant, while Khalid's mother was an especial favourite, and would naturally endeavour to prejudice her lord in favour of her own son. Khalid was born in 1819 of a Malabar concubine, who had great influence over Sa'eed and did not scruple to use it; he was of a mean and penurious disposition, and was as much despised by the Arabs as he was petted and indulged by his father. His energies were entirely absorbed in trade, by which he had amassed a large fortune, and on account of this he was generally known and spoken of as the Banian. Sa'eed was very desirous that Khalid should succeed him, but fate decreed otherwise, and Khalid after a long illness died on the 7th November 3854. Two years younger than Khalid and born of a Georgian mother, Thoweynee was brave and generous, and much respected by the Arabs. He was greatly superior to Khalid, but could never have held his own against Hilal in 'Oman, and it was for this reason chiefly that the latter was recalled to Zanzibar in 1841. Sa'eed had much faith and confidence in Thoweynee, and had publicly announced that he wished him to succeed as ruler at Muscat.RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1883-84. 35 The next few years of Sa^eed's life were tolerably uneventful, and were spent in the relax ing climate of Zanzibar, where his sensual habits must have tended to unfit him for the active government of his Arab dominions. During his long residence in East Africa Sa^eed^s main employment was to look after his estates and trading ventures, and to continue to add to his already large and unwieldy navy. Reverting now to affairs in ''Oman, we see that Seyf, who had become Wali of Sohar on the retirement of his father Hamud, and who had gradually made himself independent, was at length opposed by a coalition of the Yal Saad and other Batineh tribes, and, together with his uncle Kais, overthrown and put into confinement. From this Seyf not long after escaped and recovered Sohar, but Hamud, angry with him for having dismissed the pious Khalalee, and jealous of his friendship and alliance with Thoweynee, caused him to be assassinated, and then resumed charge of Sohar. This was in 1849. Thoweynee did not fail to represent these preceedings of Hamud to Government, and eventually he was informed that, as Hamud had violated the engagement that had been made through the media tion of the Resident, they would not again intervene in the matter. About the same time Thoweynee received orders from Sauced to endeavour to obtain possession of Hamud's person 5 and with this object in view he proceeded up the coast in the Feiz Allum frigate and lured Hamud under a show of friendship to Shinas, where he treacherously seized and carried him to Muscat. Here be was confined for a few days in Jelali fort, and then put to death by poison on the 23rd April 1850. Thoweynee did not gain the immediate advantage he expected by this, for Sohar was at once occupied by Kais, who, on being blockaded, called in the aid of the Kowasim and compelled Thoweynee to raise the siege. Kais, moreover, succeeded in capturing Shinas, Khor, Fakan, and Ghalla, and not content with this he arrested Kahtan-bin-Seyf, who had been concerned in the seizure of Hamud, and cruelly murdered him by decapitation with a blunt sword. When the news of these events reached India, the action of Thoweynee was viewed with strong disapprobation by Government, his conduct towards Hamud being characterised as a gross violation of the treaty. Sa^eed, after much urging, at length realised the necessity of his presence in 'Oman, where he arrived on the 16th May 1851. ■ On receiving Thoweynee's report he did not hesitate to approve all his proceedings, as indeed he could not well help doing, for Thoweynee had clearly acted under instruction, though there is some doubt whether Sa'eed had actually given orders for Hamud to be put to death. Sa'eed at once began to prosecute war against Kais-bin-Azzar. He moved first against Khabooreh, which soon submitted, and then with little difficulty recaptured Shinas. Ultimately^ deserted by the Kowasim, Kais made terms and retired to Rostak with a pension of $200 monthly, Sohar being surrendered to Sa'eed, who thus for the second time became its unques tioned possessor. Eager to be at rest again in his African home, Sa'eed, having tranquillised his country, sailed away from Muscat in the month of November 1852. By this campaign and his generally judicious arrangements with the leading Shaikhs and Chiefs of 'Oman, Sa'eed greatly increased his reputation, and his authority became more firmly established than it had been for many years previously. But the reign of peace was short, for scarcely had Sa'eed left 'Oman when the Wahabee Chief, Abdulla-bin-Feysal, with an unusually large force entered the country and re-occupied the old position at Bereymee. The terms he at first demanded were so extravagant that Thoweynee was unable to agree to them, and, proceeding to Sohar, assumed a hostile attitude. By the intervention of the British Resident, however, Abdulla-bin-Feysal lowered his tone, and an arrangement was eventually come to by which the annual tribute to Nejd was increased to twelve thousand dollars. Abdulla-bin-Feysal soon after returned to Nejd, leaving as general at Bereymee Ahmed-el Sadeyree to represent the Ameer's interests. Elated by his success against Kais, Sa'eed, on quitting his native country in 1852, had indulged the fond hope that he might be suffered to spend the remainder of his days in peace in the beautiful island he had chosen for his residence. His health and strength, it is said, had given way greatly in the last few years, and it was natural enough that at his age and with his enfeebled constitution he should seek repose. The recent incursion of the Wahabees, how ever, the vexatious treatment of the Wali Seyf-bin-Nebhan, and the continued aggression by the Persians at Bunder Abbass, forced him to turn his face towards Muscat. On the 15th April 1854, Sa'eed, who was very apprehensive at this time of French designs on his territory in East Africa, and who had been for three days and nights in consultation with the leading Arabs at Zanzibar on the subject, paid a visit to the British Consulate, and, placing the hand of his son Khalid in that of Colonel Hamerton, expressed the desire that Khalid should be guided by the Consul's advice in all his doubts and difficulties during his own absence, adding that, unless 5 a36 administbation ebpokt of the peesian gulp political Colonel Hamerton remained to support them neither Khalid nor the other leading Arabs would C ' ,e l'! tkelTapproval and aoceptauee of Sa'eed's words the Arabs present all kissed Colonel Hamerton 's hand ind promised loyal compliance. Sa'ced then embarked m the A fngate on The 18th, and, bidding a reluctant adieu to the children and relat.ves he was never to see affain sailed for Muscat, where he arrived about a month later. ' 0 Two months after Sa'eed's departure Captain Fremantle, H M. S. who bad been sent on a mission to obtain the cession by purchase of the Koona Moona Islands, on wh.ch were valuable guano deposits, arrived at Zanzibar. The French had on several occas.ons endeavoured to get possession of the guano, but their negociations had always failed. Cap an lemantle s efforts, however, were more successful. Having proceeded on to Muscat, he had no sooner intimated the desire of the Government to acquire the islands than Sa eed, at once refusing the offer of purchase, agreed to their transfer, and made them over hy a deed of gift, dated 14th July 1851. One of the first acts of Sa'eed on his arrival at Muscat had been to appoint his fifth son, Toorkee, as Wali of Sohar, a post which he continued to hold for some years. The breach between Sa'eed and the Persian Government, most probably with design on the part of the latter, gradually widened and culminated at length in the expulsion of Sa eed s Wali and troops from Bunder Abbass. This district had been conquered in 1798 from the Beni Maeen by Sultan, and had since been uninterruptedly held in farm from Teheran for an annual rental of 6,000 tomans. Highly incensed at the proceedings of Persia, Sa'eed equipped an expedition and despatched it under Thoweynee to Bunder Abbass, which was soon re-occupied. Fresh troops, however, were marched down from Shiraz, and, reinforced by these, the Persian commander again expelled the Arabs, and Sa'eed, after an ineffectual blockade, was compelled to abandon the hope of recovering his supremacy over the Persian coast by force of arms. Negociations were then opened, and a convention was eventually concluded in April 1856, by which the lease was renewed to Sa'eed by the Shah for 20 years at an increased rental of 16,000 tomans under several stringent conditions, which were very derogatory to Sa'eed's pride. Unfavourable as the terms were, however, Sa'eed gladly accepted them rather than relinquish the farm, and he at once retook charge of Bunder Abbass and appointed a Wali and customs farmer to resume control over the territory. At this time the relations between England and Persia were greatly strained in conse quence of the occupation of Herat by the latter, and war was known to be imminent. Sa'eed, however, did not wait to witness the denouement. One reason for this was, perhaps, his dis appointment at not receiving more countenance and support from the British Government in his quarrel about Bunder Abbass, but a more cogent reason was his precarious state of health, which made him impatient to get back to his home at Zanzibar. He stayed in Muscat there fore only until the change of the monsoon enabled him to turn his face southwards, and then, having appointed his son Thoweynee his Deputy in Arabia, he set sail on the 15th September in the Victoria frigate, accompanied by his son Barghash in the Artemise. Nature seems to have warned the aged prince of his approaching end. Before embarking he took a final and affectionate farewell of his old mother Ghannee, and said he felt confi dent he would see her no more. He was particular in having a number of planks taken on boar-d the Victoria, and gave orders that in the event of any one dying on the voyage a coffin was to be made and the body placed therein. On no account was it to be thrown into the sea. After touching at Soor to transact business, Sa'eed continued his voyage, but on the 18th Sep tember was taken ill with swelling of the legs and thighs; he continued to grow gradually worse until the 13th October, when dysentery set in, and on Sunday the 19th, at 8| a.m ., his life passed quietly away. The Victoria was passing Coctivi Island at the time, and six days after arrived off Chumba Island in Zanzibar harbour, where she anchored with the Artemise. In obedience to Sa'eed's wishes, the Captain, Hilal-bin-Abdulla, had on his master's decease enclosed the body in a coffin, and immediately on news of the sad event being communicated to Seyyid Majid at Zanzibar, preparations were made for the burial. The corpse was landed the same night, and in presence of the sons and Arab notables was interred in the little cemetery near the palace, where a plain horizontal slab of white marble without inscription now marks the grave of 'Oman's famous prince. At the age of 66 years and 7 months, and after a reign of nearly 50 years, Sa'eed thus closed a career which can only be described as remarkable. Left an orphan when a mere youth,RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1883-84. 37 his restless and enterprising spirit urged him to step over a cousin's body to seize with avidity the reins of power at a time when his country was harassed by foreign invaders and torn by intestine commotion. At such a time an abler and more experienced prince might well have shrunk from accepting the burden, but Sa'eed apparently felt himself equal to the position and proved himself to be so. His courage, capacity, and sustained energy enabled him to combat and eventually triumph over all difficulties until he had leisure to devote to the well-being of his own dominions, which he extended and raised to a pitch of prosperity they had never before witnessed. In character Sa'eed was a genuine Arab and possessed the contradictory and irre- concileable qualities common to that race. He was very courageous, and on many occasions displayed exalted personal bravery ; he was amiable and gentle, though fiery and vindictive ; generous, yet niggardly; just and lenient, yet too often cruel and perfidious. He appears to have been above the average in general ability of his family, which is unquestionably one of superior intelligence in 'Oman, and he was admittedly unrivalled in the tact and discrimination he exhibited in dealing with the Arab tribes. One does not look for high statesmanship in a prince accustomed to such tortuous methods of rule as Sa'eed preferred, and his frequent failures and ill-considered campaigns are sufficient to disrobe him of any pretension to military genius. But he can claim the distinction that he was the first Arab prince to effect the pacification of the East Coast of Africa; that he was at one period the first naval power in the East, not ex- cepting the British, and that by his encouragement and protection of commerce he made his capitaf the emporium of trade between India, Persia, and Arabia, and immensely increased the wealth of his country. Whilst still young, Sa'eed had followed the example of his father, Sultan, and engaged extensively in trade, 'freighting his ships at every port in the Indian Ocean. Attracted by the equity of Sa'eed's government and the superior security of Muscat from piratical neighbours, the merchants of Bahrein, Basra, and Persia soon flocked to the port, which thus became an important entrepot and rose in a few years from an insignificant town to a city of 60,000 inhabitants. The rapid development of East African commerce was equally due to his fostering care and protection, and the wisdom and foresight he displayed in this matter were rewarded by the increase of his revenue, which was mainly derived from customs dues, from 200,000 dollars when he first assumed power to five or six times that amount in his later days. On nothing did Sa'eed lavish more money and attention than in acquiring and arming ships of war, and as regards number, and so he possessed certainly a respectable fleet. The largest vessel he ever possessed was the Liverpool, a two-decker of U guns, which put to sea in 1836, and was presented bv Sa'eed to King William IV about ten years later. In 1847, when his navy was somewhat reduced it is said to have consisted of 9 frigates and corvettes, of which the latest was the Shah Allam of 5^ guns, and half a dozen sloops and brigs. Sa eed, however, had little real u^e for his ships, and did not know how to employ them; they were never kept in proper order, but were allowed to lie rotting in the harbour, where-the appearance of power served nevertheless to gratify his vanity and love of ostentation in such matters. n , when Mohammed Ali was threatening'Oman and hostilities were anticipated, the Indian Government had some thoughts of utilising Sa'eed's fleet in their naval operations, until it was represented to them that, as the vessels were neither in seaworthy condition nor properly foun , it would require a greater expenditure than was advisable to render them fit for service. Sa'eed's relations with the British Government were from almost the commencement of his career of the most friendly description, and, though this was of course in part the dictate of poUcy, for on several occasions his rule only escaped collapse by our timely intervention yet he was unquestionably well disposed to us at heart; and the son who has followed closest fn his father's steps in this respect, Toorkee, has been heard to say that Sa eed repeatedly counselled his children to stand at all times loyally by the British Government, and never o refuse any request that might be made by them. According to Oriental usage the m ima e relations existing between the British and Muscat Governments were marked by a constant interchange of presents. In return for the Liverpool Sa'eed was presen ed with a beautiM yacht called the Prince Regent ; and the magnificent presents despatched by him to Hei Majesty on the occasion of her coronation were similarly acknowledged. Sa'eed had altogether three wives, two Persians, of whom the less said the better, and one Arab lady, viz., Azza-bin-Seyf Al -bu-Saudee, whose only child died young. All his other children, numbering twenty-four sons and about half as many daughters, were y concubines.38 PART III. TRADE OF THE PEESIAN GULF DURING THE YEAR 1883. The value and fluctuations of this trade ean be approximately learnt from the annexed tables prepared with much care from all the available sources of information by Mr. fcr. Lucas, Vice-Consul at Bushire. Imports into Persia have continued to increase, and, as the goods imported were much in excess of the requirements of the markets, forced sales were often necessary at unrenrnnerative prices. The increase of imports was most marked in piece-goods, metals, and loaf-sugar. Some of the European firms at Bushire opened branches at Sluraz and Ispahan, in view of supplying the large consuming districts direct, instead of through native agency. Th.s has caused the retirement of some native merchants and the closmg of many native agency houses at Bushire. Wheat was fairly abundant, fetched good prices, and was exported on a moderate scale. The agricultural districts benefited and were generally prosperous. The exports of opium decreased, severe losses on sales .n China having deterred cultiva tors considerably. The pearl trade of the Gulf in 1883 was again unfavourable. The yield was good, but demand for pearls did not come up to the expectation of the dealers. Trade between the Gulf and Bombay received an impetus owing to the low rates of freight from Europe to Bombay, which enabled merchants to import more cheaply through Bombay than direct from Europe to the Gulf. In May 1883 a treaty of commerce was signed between the Netherlands and Persia, the terms of which corresponded generally with those of the h rench-1 ersian Commercial Treaty of 1855. The Dutch treaty provides, however, for the establishment of five Dutch Consulates in Persia,— i.e., at Bushire, Tabreez, Besht, Ispahan, and Mohammerah, whereas the number of French Consuls have been limited to three. The Dutch treaty likewise provides for re -exportation of goods, on payment of one per cent, duty in addition to warehouse charges, and for the erection of special warehouses to this end at Bushire. Ihe ratifications of this treaty were to have been exchanged at Teheran within a period of four months, but the term appears to have been extended. British merchants do not anticipate much advantage from this concession, as there is at present no re-export trade, and none is expected to spring up.EESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1883-84. 39 APPENDIX B TO PART III. SUPPLEMENTABY NOTES ON CAKE AND CULTUEE OP DATE TREES AND PEUIT. [Videpage 43 of Administration 'Report for 1877-781] In districts wliere date plantations are large and on extensive scales, tlie cultivators do not tliiak seriously of the comparatively small loss, caused by the depredations of wasps, sparrows, crows, ' bulbuls/'' &amp;c., on the sweet date fruit while forming on the palm, and as a rule do not provide against sugar-loving insects and birds, and grudge them not a share of the fruit. They say that in the good old times the cultivators were more liberal-minded, when the export trade of the date to European countries and America did not exist, and those countries had not acquired a taste for this fruit; that then any number of strangers could go to a plantation and treat themselves acl libitum to any quantity of date fruit they liked, without objection. But times have changed. The demand for the fruit having largely increased, it is more taken care of, and strangers are not allowed to indulge in those liberties. But I believe that all this apparent indifference to the encroachments of the aforesaid creatures cannot be solely attributed to their alleged magnanimity and charitable feelings for them—at least in these days whan the fruit has a market value; but that their indolence and the actual difficulty, perhaps costliness, of the measures to provide against these inroads must explain a great deal. The ordinary wants of these people are few and simple; they are satisfied with what little they get, and are content to live on the same; as a result their inventive faculties are not taxed for devising means against such sources of loss, which certainly cannot be considered of no moment. But if the case was otherwise, and the struggle for life was as great as in European countries, protective measures would doubtless be fast forthcoming, simply because ' necessity is the mother of invention/-' In places where the date palms are few, and some choice dates are concerned, the date bunch is put into a gunny bag and the mouth of the bag closed up and tied securely at the lower part of the date spadix, to prevent the depredations of those insects and birds. At Bustak, Gowda, Jenna, and other inland districts on the Persian mainland, where dry hot winds prevail, the cultivators allow the fruit to ripen and dry on the palm, and with a view to protect it from the injurious effects of very dry and hot winds as soon as the date has become sweet, but before it has commenced to soften and become juicy, they wrap up the whole bunch, the stalk of which being already sufficiently bent down for purposes of easy manipulation, in the leafy twigs of a perennial bush called ' salm, ^ and, securely tying the leafy covering, leave the bunch until jit is finally cut down when the date has ripened and formed. This method gives also a good deal of protection against the inroads of birds and wasps. In some districts, as those of Minab, sometimes bears prove destructive to the fruit; but the cultivator effectually provides against their climbing up by tying a quantity of some thorny bush or twigs of samr (thorny acacia) or koona (zyzyphus) around the stem of the palm at some height from the ground. Against a flight of locusts he is perfectly helpless; all his attempts at driving them away, by beating about among the palms with dry date leaves, and agitating them to cause a rustling noise, &amp;c., and his burning quantities of hay, tamarisk branches, and other rubbish to create smoke, prove of little or no avail; as, when the locusts alight and squat, they completely devour the fruit and leave the palm, in a short space of time, divested of its leafy appendages. There are two principal forms in which the date fruit is cured and prepared for commercial purposes,— viz., (1), 'khoorma,' soft and juicy; (2) 'kharak-pookhta,' dry and firm. The following is the usual mode adopted for preparing 'khoorma' for commercial purposes : — As soon as the dates become ripe and juicy, they are picked off the tree and gathered into a round chunam tank called 'madibsah,' where they are exposed to the sun and air, and throw off the excess of juice which runs through the aperture at the bottom of the ' madibsah,' and collects in a separate jar, buried underground to receive it. After two or three days' exposure, when the date has sufficiently hardened and formed, it is removed and packed in date-leaf baskets for exportation. Sometimes, when the owner does not find a ready purchaser, he stores the date baskets in a close-plastered room called 'kandool' in piles of 15 to 20 baskets; the floor is furnished with channels which convey the juice thrown off under the mutual pressure of the bags, to a large jar buried underground. Sometimes the juice is40 ADMINISTRATION REPOKT OF THE PERSIAN OULF POLiriOAL i,. , fVip flow bv Dourinff little warm watsr on they 1™ in the m JLh.'

There are other varieties not well known, and are comprised under the general term ' Kharoo. ' At El Hasa the best dates, principally Khalas, are packed in skins of 70 to K0 pounds for export. So also at Busrah dates are packed in skins; the dates are picked for the purpose; the skins are then allowed to dry in the sun and covered with gunny. At Bahrain and Kateef, Khalas and other dates of superior quality are put in small earthen jars and rendered palatable by adding to them small quantities of sesame seeds and ginger powder; the jars are then sewn up in the date-leaf matting. Now, since the European and American firms have commenced to send dates to their own countries, they have adopted the system of packing the best dates i.e., Hallowi, Khadrawi, Zahedi, and Sayer—in deal boxes of various shapes and sizes, brought ready made from those countries. The average size of a box is about 45 pounds-net weight. Hallowi dates are also carefully packed in small cardboard boxes, 10 to 15 of which are then put in a large deal box, which is then nailed over. The best dried dates of sound skin, and specially those which are allowed to dry on the palm, are carefully picked by a large number of labourers, principally women, boys, and girls, employed for the purpose. A certain weight of dates so picked intended to go in a box is taken; the dates are then carefully placed, one by one, in rows, so as to form layers in the box, which is lined with paper and eventually nailed and ready for export. Some people put hoops round the boxes and cover them with gunny, while others do not. These layers are pressed down three or four times during the filling of each box. The dates packed in boxes in layers throughout have now the best repute in the market. Small quantities of dates have lately been shipped from Busrah in fancy baskets, but on account of the heavy freight no sanguine hopes are entertained of this method proving a success. Hallowis keep best, but Zahidis are the brightest in colour, but soon get wormy and spoiled. The cultivator has other modes of curing fresh dates and making preserves of them in small quantities for his personal use and for presents to his friends, and even for sale to a small extent. ' Khoorma-Sheerah' is generally made of Murda-sang and Khanaizi dates- The best dates are culled and further well dried in the sun, exposed on mats or date jowlies, and protected during nights from dews. They are then washed with diluted date juice, of all dust, &amp;c., and put in a jar mixed with sesame seeds, ginger, walnut kernel, &amp;c.; a quantity of good date juice is poured in so as to cover the whole. This is much prized by the natives. ' Khoorma Seh-Roza/ J so named from its being fit to be eaten on the third day of its being potted. It is a rare and special preparation made at Minab from the Hilali dates. The fresh6 EESIDENCY A.ND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1883-84. 41 ' ratab ' is taken, its skin is removed by the date-leaf spine; then the coarser but soft layer of the pnlp; finally the white firm pnlp which is left round the stone is further detached and collected in small earthen pots. The mass is rendered more palatable by adding to it a quantity of pistachio and almonds, &amp;c. This is considered a great delicacy. ft Khoorma Post-kandah,' the skinned date.—This can be prepared from all the good varieties of dates, but it is generally made from the Hilali. As above, the skin of the fresh 'ratab' is removed by the date spine, the stone is pushed out by the same; the fleshy part is gathered and packed in large earthen pots. ' Moorabba Khoorma' (date preserve).—The ripe 'Kharak of Hilali,' i.e., before they have become 'ratab' (soft and juicy), are taken; portions from both ends are sliced off; they are then deeply punctured all over by the date spine and well dried in the sun. The stone is sometimes replaced by almond or pistachio. The ' Kharak' thus treated is boiled in sugar syrup to a sufficient consistence, and forms an excellent preserve, and may be bottled and kept for any length of time. (c Matgoogah.'—The sweet and fresh ' Kharak' is broken up and dried in the sun for five or six days. It is then pounded in a wooden mortar; the powder is put in boiling date juice and mixed with sesame seeds and flavoured with cardamoms, cinnamon, &amp;c. The whole mass is then well stirred while boiling, and removed from the fire and further well mixed up, and finally put in jars for use. The second form in which the date fruit is cured for commercial purposes is the ' Kharak pookhta,' the boiled date. It is prepared as follows When the ' Kharak ' has become sweet, but before it has begun to soften, the spadix, with its load of dates, is cut off from the palm and immersed in large copper pots of boiling water, in which it is allowed to remain for a time, which is decided by the man engaged to do the work. It is stated that the boiling is continued until the stone assumes a reddish colour ; when the bunches are removed and exposed to dry in sun on mats for eight or ten days; they are then detached from the spadix, allowed to dry further, and finally put in bags for export. The fruit of all the varieties of the date palm can thus be converted to ' Kharak-pookhtah,' which is dry, fir m , and even hard, and does not relish so much as the ' Khoorma, which is soft and juicy. This may perhaps account for the small quantity of ' Kharak' usually prepared. At Busrah ' Kharak-pookhtah ' is prepared in small quantities from Baraim, Sa'Ameran, Kabkab, jMaktoom, and Shakar. Baraim yields the best quality, and is said to be wholly converted into Kharak, as it does not ripen beyond the ' Kharak ' stage ; its price being two or three times more than that of Sa'Ameran Kharak, which is also abundant. The best ' Kharak-pookhtah ' of Minab is from Hallowi in small quantity, but princi pally from Zarak and Sayer. AtLarandits neighbourhood a 'Kharak-pookhtah' is obtained from the Sha-Khani date. As soon as the fresh Kharak has been sufficiently boiled, it is taken out of the water, its stone removed, and it is strung in long wreaths and hung up to dry; it is yellow and of good taste. From various causes a portion of the date-fruit does not attain maturity, and generally drops off in a half-ripe state; becomes dry, skinny, with very little flesh. In this condition it is called ' Salang,' |nd used as food for sheep and domestic cattle; sometimes it is boiled with date stones and constitutes a nutritious food to the milch-cow. The age of an off-shoot is no reliable guide for its being detached from its parent for pur poses of a successful transplantation. An offshoot sometimes continues at the foot of its parent several years, but under the various unfavourable circumstances of soil, supply of water, &amp;c., it is small and weak, and therefore unfit for transplantation; while under favouiable ciicum- stances an offshoot, 3 or 4 years old, is vigorous and large, and does not usually, when trans planted, fail to strike root and survive. Hence the vigour of growth and the actual size of the young plant are taken into consideration. The average weight of the young plant most suitable for purposes of transplantation is considered to be six pounds ; but larger weights are preferred, as, after striking, the plant grows rapidly, and bears fruit without much trouble and expense to the cultivator. It is averred that sometimes offshoots which have commenced to bear fruit are carefully detached and successfully transplanted. The Phoenix dactylifera, or the Arabian date palm, being dioecious,—?: the male and female flowers existing on separate plants,—the conveyance of the pollen to the female flowers is essential to fertilisation and formation of the date fruit.4 2 ADMINISTEATION EEPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL • '— ' 7 ~ far lovinff flies and insects does not seem to be suffi- The agency of winds and var10 ^ ^ such cases the fruit yielded is stated to become cient to effect f' 6 ; e ' wit ' hou t stone, and totally insipid, and is termed ' Shis.' abortive or blighted, witl nsi ' dered essent i a l for a fruitful impregnation.

But, as a mle.he does n t allow all the Hower -spathes, which vary from 12 to 24, to remain on the palm and form fruTt because bv doing so the fruit becomes small and degouerate, and during the next year the yMd of the fruit is lessened. According to the vigour of the palm, which he knows by es- periencc, he leaves 8 to 12 bunches to form frnit. The excess is removed and consumed by his people and friends. The sprigs of the male flower are preserved in a dry form one or .wo months and used as ocoasion demands. They are, however, before being used slightly moistened with water to prevent the pollen from being scattered and blown away by the wind. It is stated that sometimes, when the male flower is not in sufficient quantity at Kharg, the cultivators import it from Busrah. Pollen of one year cannot, it is stated, be preserved for use during the next year, as it becomes spoiled. W hen the female blossom has thus been treated with pollen, the supply of water is cut off for a time, varying from one and a half to two months, as excess of water is said to be detrimental to a proper fertilisation. The general method adopted for cultivating the date palm in these paits, where it is grown for economic and commercial purposes, is that it is planted in extensive groves for facilities of tending them and collecting the fruit. Spots are selected where abundance of water is avail able in shape of river, spring, cc kanat/ J or well water ; in other places, where water from wells is scanty, such spots are selected as can be irrigated by rain-torrents during the rainy season. A plot of ground is selected according to the number of palms which it is intended to plant in a grove, which may consist of 80 to 150 or 200 palms, planted in regular rows, with a distance of 12 to 15 feet between them. The grove is surrounded by a high 'bund^ for purposes of admitting and retaining water in the grove, and generally regulating its irrigation, being provided with inlets and outlets to admit and get rid of excess of water, especially that from rain-torrents. ^ For the first two or three months, after the offshoots have been planted^they are watered, each separately, by water carried to them in pots ; great care is taken that no mud gets into the heart or crown of the young plant, as it proves destructive to it. After the plants have struck root they are watered once a week, a fortnight, or a longer interval is allowed to elapse, but it is essential that they must be well watered once a month. When they have grown up and have attained some age, they are watered once a month during the hot months only. At Busrah, where water is abundant from the river, deep and wide trenches are dug between the rows of the palms, and filled with water. But where water is scanty it is allowed to run down in small channels to the foot of each palm, the ground being previously well dug up, loosened, and turned over to allow of its thorough saturation. Vegetables, lucerne, &amp;c., are grown, as at Bahrain, in these groves, such a cultivation being considered highly beneficial in improving the soil. With this object also the soil is ploughed and turned over once a year to render it soft, porous, and permeable to air moisture. In places which border the sea, fins of Awal or Lookhm, a species of Ray-fish, are used for purposes of manuring the palm; two or three bits are buried at the foot of each palm, and it is regularly watered once or twice a week until the whole is absorbed and disappears j orEESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1883-84. 43 these fins are put in, and allowed to macerate in the tank of water which feeds the plantation, and the palms are regularly fed by water so impregnated. In other places where this is not available, the dung of the cow, sheep, and goats, &amp;c., and surface sweepings are used. The best spot for extensive date plantations would be, as at Busrah, Mohammerah, and Minab, along the river banks abounding in alluvial soil. Excess of water generally is said to spoil the date fruit, and if the plantations become flooded and continue so any length of time by any very unusual rise of river waters, not only is the fruit damaged, but the palms have been known to die. So also damp air, when the fruit is forming, is said to be prejudicial, as a great deal of it drops off in a green state; this green date is called ' Khamal,' and is given to sheep and cattle ; but the poor people consume it with fish. Moderately dry winds are said to be very beneficial. To secure a vigorous growth to the palm, as also to obtain materials for economic purposes, the following points require to be attended to. A s the date palm grows each year the lower whorls of the leafy stalks, as their vitality diminishes and they become dry, are chopped off; the long stalks called ' Goorz ' are made into jowlies for covering sheds, roofs of houses, and various economic purposes. Their lower thick ends, called ' tapool,' are used for fuel, but those which are broad and light are used as floats for fish-nets. The flower spadix and its spathe must also be removed. The green spadix, when well beaten with billets of wood, yields a quantity of fibre useful for rope-making. In a dry state it is used as fuel, but if allowed to macerate and soften in water on being pounded between billets of wood yields fibres for ropes. From the fresh spathe, called ' lara, is obtained the 'Tara' water, by distillation. It is of a strong but agreeable smell, and is prepared at Busrah and Bahrain; sold in carboys at one and a half to two rupees each. It is made into a sherbet, and is greatly prized by the Arabs and Persians. The young offshoots sprouting at the base of the palm, if they are not intended for trans plantation, must be removed in the spring of each year, as they prevent it from thriving. In the same way the buds, which sometimes form and grow from the crown of the palm, resembling the offshoots at the base, must also be pulled away, as they weaken the palm. These buds are sometimes said to have grown and yielded fruit when allowed to grow on the palm. (Signed) A, R. HAKIM, L.M., Jsst. to Pol. Residenty Persian Gulf.

TRADE. T he approximate statistics of trade shown in the annexed tables exhibit a general depres- sion during the past year. The numerous insolvencies at Bombay and Zanzibar have had an effect at Muscat, and several old-established firms have collapsed. The American date trade is rising in importance and yearly increasing, but the keen competition that took place last season resulted generally in a loss to the speculators. The particular sort of date required for the American market is the ' fard,^ and the demand for it raised the value to such an extent that the Arabs are now beginning to plant this kind in their gardens to the exclusion of others. As regards imports, kerosine oil from America is being imported in largely-increased quantities, but the Merikani sheetings, which had almost driven out the Manchesters, are now being superseded by the Bombay productions. Other articles of import have remained much the same, as the quantities required for an unprogressive country vary but little from year to year. 'Oman was visited by unusually heavy floods of rain in February 1884, which have been of great benefit, and the date crop of the ensuing season is expected to be above the averaare. Sr B.
