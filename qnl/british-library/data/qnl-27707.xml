They continue to feature prominently at Agency gatherings; I have twoof them on my Hadio Listeners* Committee; I have ensured their repesentstion on the Malaria Committee and have gone out of my way to help individuals on various occasions. Nevertheless there is not the least doubt that they were mainly responsible for the agitation in 1938 and with a few notable exceptions it is impossible to discern in them nowadays any feelings of loyalty either to us or to the Bahrain Government. 5 # As I Have said, I Have plenty of hope that a simple warning will be all that is needed here.

He exhibited some anxiety about what might happen if Italy entered the war and he thought that the Iranian Government might welcome the opportunity of using persons of Persian origin here to cause disturbance or at any rate difficulties for the Bahrain Government. 2. While 1 think that Shaikh Abdullah*s fears were somewhat exaggerated and while 1 am firmly opposed to increasing the bands of personal Fidawis i do recognise that some of the Holis are thoroughly disloyal and are gx&amp;iiJ prolific ground for fifth column activities.

We had an official letter on the subject from the Foreign Office on the 9th May 1934 which, for various reasons, we have never been able to get to the point of answering. I therefore wrote a d.o. letter to the Foreign Office on August 12th, of which a copy is below, with a view to rounding off the correspondence and explaining to them that we do not propose to answer their official letter. As you will see I do not propose to do anymore at this stage, especially as in practice it does not appear that Bahreinis are any longer being ill-treated in Persia. If you agree generally with the contents of my letter to^Baggallay, I propose to put the ^ ^ /V UV TZ, \ IBDIA : Baggalley, «ould JOU Jtindlj refer to Foreign Office letter iu f Be Bth &gt; 1934, iio* E* 2633/15-61/91 and correspondence regarding the ill-treatment of Bahreinis in Persia, .ve Miy ® riever answered this letter officially, though we have been on the point of doing so several times and w ® have had a good deal of inconclusive correspondence &amp;ith India and the Gulf on the subject with copies of which 1 need not trouble you* It now seems that the probie has receded into the background, but it may be well if 1 summarise the position as it appears to us at present* are ail now agreed that nothing effective can be done on behalf of Bahreini® who have acquired Persian nationality by virtue of the Persian nationality law, but tnere is still a category, probably a small one, of Bahreinis who do not fall within the scope of the Persian ENCLOSURE IN WEEKLY LETTER 0 33 15 AUG 1935 ; ;x!^ SECRETARY, POLITICAL AMD SECRET DEPT.

On this, however, the question arises whether these persecuted Bahreinis in fact wish to leave Persia. This is as far as we have got up to the present.Minute Paper. political Department. 2956 6000 The discussions which have taken place since the receipt of the Foreign Office letter of 9th May 1934 nave made various points clear. The most important documents are the Political Resident’s letter of 13th Jaly 1934, P.Z.5126/34, the Government of India’s d.o. letter of 18th September, P.Z.6238, f orwarding Moj^Prior ’ s note on the question, the Political Resident’s letter of tie 17th November, P.Z.7196/34, and the Government of India’s letter of the 1st February 1935, at P.Z.928/35. 2. In the first place there is no actual Bahrein nationality law, see P.Z.5126/34, but in spite of this Bahreinis can claim to be considered Bahrein subjects either on the analogy of jus soli or by the adoption of the criterion suggested in para.4 of the Foreign Office letter. 3. However, most of the Bahreinis in Persia are also indubitably Persian subjects as a result of the Persian nationality law, and so long as they continue to reside in Persia their master nationality will be Persian. 4. It is now generally agreed that His Majesty’s Government can do nothing effectual on behalf of suen Bahreinis, but it is still open to H.M.G. to protest on behalf of those Bahreinis who neither own land in Persia, nor come within the scope of the Persian nationality law. 5. It is equally generally agreed that it is of local political importance to protest on behalf of this category, because an abandonment of all attempt to protect such persons would be tantamount to acknowledging the Persian claim to sovereignty over Bahrein. The Persian Government do not, however, pay much attention to protests and the question has therefore arisen whether a policy of retaliation should be adopted in order to make our protests/effectual. protests more g, in general H.M.G. are^likely to be in favour o, such retaliation because it Has been our gener-1 policy to avoid any provocative action vis-a-vis the Persi Government. The position may, however, be said to ha changed ligand since the evacuation of Henjam and Basidu which has removed certain possibilities of counte. retaliation by the Persians, H.M.G. are m a bettei position to take a strong line with the Persian Government should they wish to do so. 7. The various methods of retaliation thau *x ve been suggested do not, however, appear likely to achieve their main object, i.e. the better treatment of Bahreinis by the Persian Government, and most of the suggestions have now been discarded for one reason or another. Colonel Fowle’s criticisms at P.Z. 7196/34 of MiyiPrior’ s suggestions are fairly conclusive, whilst Colonel Fowled own suggestion is ruled out by the Government of India s letter at P.Z.928. There remain two possibilities; the bringing of the Persian schools under the control of Bahrein educational authority, and the settlement of ’'Persian” Bahreinis on the west side of the island of Bahrein. The first is probably desirable on administrative grounds and might be useful as a measure of retaliation; the second would probably have little effect on the Persian Government but would have great advantage in meeting the complaints of the Bahreinis that the Sheikh would do nothing for them. The practical implications of these two schemes are still being explored, and it is therefore not possible to draw any definite conclusi at this point. 8 . We might, however, send our long delayed reply the Foreign Office, stating such points upon which agreement has already been reached and leaving the question of retaliation open for further eonside^a* . onsDraft Paper. 1 political Department. DRAFT The U.S.of S. , Foreign Office. / / v\ \ ff ' r V O s*-'' p ^4 LETTER. Sir, I am directed Ly the Secretary of State for India to say that he has had under his consideration the correspondence noted in the margin on the subject of the illtreatment of Bahreinis in Persia. From Col.Fowle’s express letter of the 13th July, Bo.661 S, copy of which is enclosed herewith, it will be seen that there is no actual Bahrein nationality law. If there were advantage in enacting a nationality law the Secretary of State does not anticipate that any difficulty would be experienced in persuading the Sheikh to agree to its enactment. The Secretary of State, however, considers that Bahreinis can rightly claim to oe considered Bahrein subjects on the analogy of the .jus soli or by adopting the criterion suggested in para. 4 of tbs Foreign Office letter under reply. 2. After examining the legal position, the Marquess of Zetland agrees with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that it is not possible for H.M.G- to protest officially against maltreatment of Bahreinis who^ either own land in Persia or can be A shown to enjoy Persian nationality ^ under the Persian nationality law. 3761 5000 5.;)5I / / 3. There remains, however, a category of Bahreinis, though admittedly it is probably a small one, who do not come within the scope of Persian nationality law. Whilst admitting the undesirability of any unavoidable controversy with the Persian Government, the Marquess of Zetland would however, suggest, for the consideration of Sir Samuel Hoare, that there would be justification for H.M.G. to protest officially on behalf of such persons, and even if little satisfaction can be obtained fron the Persian Government by such protests,he considers, nevertheless, that it is of local political importance that such protests should continue to he made. 4 . It will he observed from the correspondence forwarded herewith that the possibility of making protests more effectual by adopting a policy of retaliation has been under consideration. The Secretary of State considers that the majority of the methods of retaliation so far suggested are unlikely to achieve their main object, i.e. better treatment of the Bahreinis by the Persian Government. He is, however, awaiting the further views of the Political Resident on two schemes, firstly, for bringing Persian schools under the control of the Bahrein educational authorities, and secondly, for settling persecuted / I' v *, -M-r3761 5000 5.35 Draft Paper. persecuted Bahreinis on the west side of Bahrein. Whilst he admits the necessity of avoiding action of a provocative nature, he feels that the two schemes referred to above might possibly prove of ultimate benefit. 5. On the question of unofficial representations, the Secretary of State realises, as stated in paragraph 9 of your letter under reply, that these are unlikely to produce a very marked effect, but he feels that an particular cases they might be of some value, and he accordingly suggests that it might be left to the discretion of H.M.Minister and the local officers concerned to take such unofficial steps as they might think advisable to mitigate the lot of such persons on whose behalf it is not possible for H.M.Gr. to protest officially( 'ONFJDEN TTu ^°. 327' : \ - \ 3 ^ ‘ s of 193 5 ^ i !

I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, COPY SENT BY oiiUmm 4 - ^ • The Under-Secretary of State, India Office.Gonfidentifil, D.O. No .F.101-N/34. hj clSC^ Please refer to your demi-official letter No. P.Z» 6238/34, dated the 20th October 1934, regarding the ill-treatment of Bahrainis in Persia. I must apologise for not having given you our views before, but as you will realize we have been rather pressed with other work of greater urgency. You will have seen Fowle f s comments contained in his demi-official letter No. 308-C of 1934, dated the 17th November 1934, of which a copy was sent to you. fe all now appear to be in general agreement that nothing effectual can be done on behalf of Bahrainis who have acquired Persian nationality by virtue of the Persian Nationality Law, and that our efforts must be confined mainly to protests on behalf of casual Bahrainis who were born in Bahrain and not in Persia and own no land, nor have any permanent interests in Persia. It is probable that these protests will not have much effect unless some form of retaliatory action can be taken. As you will see, j’owle does not approve Prior's suggestion regarding Pahlavi cans and in this we feel bound to agree with him. T e other proposal for bringing Persian Schools under the contro Bahrain Educational authority appears to be desirable on 1 N ative grounds apart from its effect as a measure o administrat. g ^ howe7er st ill examining the practical r6t f ^tion^ of tin* and also of the proposal to settle Bahrainis, wo ^ ^ su ^ es tion in paragraph 10 of letter 'would seem to imply a measure of discriminatjon% 43 - 2 *•* u i . against Persians as such, unless the Bahrain Government were to make a similar prohibition against ownership of land by any foreigner. For that reason it seems to us objectionable and could hardly be defended against Persian protest* 2 . I am afraid that the net result of all this is to leave us very much as we were before, but we have just received a copy of a Mohamerah Despatch No. 1002, dated the 23rd December 1934 (copy sent to you with the Political Residents printed letter No. 59- S of 1935 , dated the 11th January 1935) which suggests that at Abadan at any rate, where most of the trouble has arisen in the past, the Persian authorities are likely to take a more reasonable view than they have done in the past. It may therefore be hoped that our protests have had some effect and that in future it will be unnecessary to continue such protests. I am sending a copy of this letter to Fowls. To J # G.

They had been instructed by tne Persian authorities to take out Persian nationality papers and had replied that they were for signers and in possession of foreign passports* They, were, acocrdingly, requested to produce their passports for iaspection* Before doing so they decided to approach me and ask my advic^as they wished to know what to do in the event of their passports being confiscated* The present Governor of Abadan has only recently been appointed. I seized the opportunity therefore of approaching him on the whole question by sending the passports under a covering letter from this office asking for their return when inspected by the officials concerned* I sent my Interpreter with my letter and the passports to the Governor and instructed him to explain all the troubles of the past and the situation in general, cnio. told him to say' that I was only sending the passports myself to ensure that the Banrainis did not try to create trbuble by throwing the passports away themselves.

He sent his kindest regards to me and informed me that this was the manner in which he proposed to deal with the pr o bl em. 1 sent a reply to the effect t at we were giving the seme advice to the Bahrainis and that if he could make the Sijil Department keep to this arrangement we might consider the matter closed as far as he and I were concerned* I think that instruction must have come through at last and that the Bahrainis will be molested no longer provided they do not resist taking out Persian papers* While the Bahrainis themselves are beginning to take more kindly to our advice «snow that they understand that they have to choose between conscription and losing their property# As a matter of interest I would also report that I discussed the subject with my Iraq colleague, ne informed me that he is having the same trouble over certain persons living in Kohammerah who claim to be Iraqis whilst the Persians claim them to be Persians.

I s-m convinced that there is no question of any of them giving up their property or interests in Persia to return to Bahrain even without conscription* So long therefore as they are not molested i can see no useful purpose in trying to do anything further for these so-called Bahrainis who will certainly not take Bahrain nationality unless they can keep their property® In fact to satisfy them it would be more necessary to change the Persian Law regarding the holding of property by foreigners then to establish Banrain's indepegtdence in the eyes of Persia® I am sending a copy of this despatch to Bsuhire® I I am, §ir, Your obedient Servant, Sd« F.N.Chauncy, Captain, His Majesty^ Vice-Consul®o j (E S7E/4/91) j ;Q 3', j 23r&lt;i January, 1935. ^nji My dear Laitiiwaite, I\^iny thanks for your letter p.z. 159/35 of 11th January. 2 .

As regards Motamedi' note of 15th May last about Persians in Bahrein, we are inclined, on the whole now, to think that unless the Foreign Office see objection, the best plan would be to return no reply to the Persians unless they revert to the matter both in view of the lapse of time and on the ground suggested by Loch in his letter of 17th July to Tehran H.L.

Though with the introduction of the * ersi&amp;n Nationality Law ( see paragraph U below) it can no longer be said that the claim of the Persian Government to Bahrain is involved in their treatment of Bahrainis (see paragraph &amp; of my letter No* 2 T of fOth March 1934) I am still of opinion that such retalia tions as are possible t while doubtless annoying to the Persian Government} whuld not achieve our main object} i.e. the stopping of the oppression of Bahrainis in Persia (paragraph 7 of my letter No*2 T.)• 3# The two retaliatory measures advoci ted by Prior are i (a) the forbidding of Pehlavi caps in Bahrainj (b) closing of Persian schools* 4* Doubtless these} as pointed out by Prior in paragraph 2 of his note} would make the Persian Government 'squirm”, but that - though it would give me great main object, (see paragraph 2 above), and pleasure - is not our Tto« Honourable Mr. H.

Moreover (a) suffers under the following disadvantage. No government in the world, as far as 1 know, forbids foreigners wearing what clothes and head-dress they fancy. what the Persian Government, for instance, does in lersia is to order ersian s „hwt„ to wear a certain sort of cap. For the shaikh of Bahrain to be in a plausible posiUon to legislate on the subject of the head-dress of Bahraini Persians, such individuals would have to be considered Bahraini subjects, and put under the jurisdiction of the Shaikh, but this is what Prior, in paragraph 2 of his note, is strongly against. 6 . With regard to (b), 1 am not of opinion that the Bahrain Government would have a good case in taking the drastic step of closing the Persian schools* ihat they could do ( and have for some time been considering), not as a measure of retaliation but as one of administrative convenience, and for various political reasons, would be to put such schools under the control of their Department cf iiiducatiom* At present the Persian schools are under no such control* 1 have discussed th® matter with Loch and will address you separately on the subject in due course* With regard to a proposal of Biscoe that we should withdraw the Capitulations from the Bahraini Persians and subject them to the local Courts, which Prior mentions in paragraph 2 of his Fote, but of which he was not in favour# I do not think this idea is impracticable for the reason that Prior gives? that most Persians in Bahrain speak only Persian and could not be subjected to Courts whose officers speak nothing but Arabic, All over the world foreigners are atrrom thQ i^guag. point or view when Arabic for practical purposes. ? * * agree, however, with Prior that there would robhbly be disadvantages in handing over the Persian threaten to do so, I do not think that it would achieve the object of getting better treatment for Bahrainis in Persia, m connection with Biscoe's proposal one must remember that it is now generally agreed - vide correspondence ending with ludia Office letter No.P*.u*53X1/34 of 5th October 1934 to thi • vi &lt;si&gt; n l ' ice - that it would be a good thing to allow the Persians in Bahrain to come jgraduallv under the Shaikh’s jurisdiction. There is another measure of retaliations that suggested by Loch and referred to in paragraph 2 of your letter. X discussed this with Loch and he is going to examine the question further and JL t me have his opinion. Here again, however, I doubt whether the action aug ested ' would force the Persian Government to treat the Bahrainis £/ 4 [/ better, though the scheme initself has, t any rate from shaikh*s point of view, a good deal to recom end it. 9. The following general consideration has also to V borne in mind. The best kind of ret liation from our po of view would be one which could be turned off and on at will. That is to say the Persian Gove ament would be ini^-£ to become reasonable by the knowledge that when they ceased their objectionable conduct we would likewise cease being objectionable- 4 ~ cbjectioa^ble to them. Thit ^ x Ut ^ii the above suggested retal- 1&amp;UOa * US W&gt;i0r points out with regard to the particular one of tHe withdrawal of Capitulations) can only -.one once. could only intimate to the Persian -ovai-naent, in whatever way was thought desirable, that if th * y ‘ iid not cea8 « tneir ill-treatment of Bahrainis, the Bahrain Government would take such and such measures. If tue Persian Government did not respond to these threats, which I do not think tbay would, the Bahrain Government would then have to put them into force, and having done this could hold out no further inducement to the Persian Gove iiment that the measures would be relaxed if the Persian Government ceased their ill-treatment of Bahrainis* 1C. Phat is wanted is some form of suit hie retaliation which does not buffer under the disadvantages explained above# The onl/ one 1 can think of is that the Shaikh should issue a px*oclamation prohibiting ownership of land in Bahrain by Persian© and ordering that rersians who already own land in Bahrain my. will be allowed a period of, say, two years, within which to acquire Bahrain nationality, or, if they do not wish t© become Bahrain su^ects, to dispose of their property. This follows the measures taken by the Persian Government prohibiting the ownership of land by foreign lationals, appears to be a form of retaliation suited to the i&amp;se, and generally makes The punishment fit the crime. If it any time the Persians ceased their i 11 -treinant oi Bahrainis - which tiiey are not likely to - the measure •ould be relaxed. There may, however, be practical objections to the introduction of such a measure, and I ;hall address you further on this point. ^ n&gt;# as sum a that retaliations are out oi the nation, th. otOy action which we can take on behalf of (ahralnis are protests.- As pointed out in paragr^hs 3 and , of oy express better Ko.661-3 of 13th July -934, certain saumptions which of recent years had been made in connect- ion• 5 «* ion with the question of ill-treatment of Bahrainis in ®' sla * S8em ^ been controverted by the foreign Off. 1C * ' t ' helx ' l8tt * r of 9th Kay, No.iS.263B/iSl6/91, and ln ;arti0ular th * assumption that His Majesty's Government &amp;r«s legally justified in espousing the cause of Bahrainis in general, this change having been brought about by the introduction ox the ?er sian Nationality Law# In para graph 6 or Bay impress Letter quoted above, I gave the opinion, however, that there was still s certain class of .Bahrainis with regard towhon?.

He was inclined to think that the balance were probably not of very great importance. From the correspondence with Bushire below it is clear that the Government of India wish to be consulted about this question. I suggest that you might be willing to write to Mr- Metcalfe by to-day’s air mail as in the draft.

We were anxious in the first place to ascertain Fowlers views on the situation generally and. we now propose a qx/^o. t to postpone a reply * until wehave the comments of the G.of I. and any further observations which Loch may make in reply to your letter of 18th September. We should, however, be grateful if we j might have these in the near future. 2. Our own provisional view at this stage is that, in the light of the legal position as described in Foreign Office letter of 9th May, we can do nothing for Bahreinis who enjoy Persian nationality under the Persian National ity Law. This probably covers the great bulk of the Bahreinis in Persia. In the case of a Bahreini who is not in fact covered by the provisions of the Nationality Law and who is the victim of an incident, it will of course remain open to us to make a protest, and it may on general political grounds be desirable that we should do so, even though in practice the chances of securing adequate reparation from the Persians are probably relatively small. But on this/this point, aa ,.U as on the Question generally, *e snoiild »elcome the olDservations of the G.of !• 3. I make no comment at this stage on the suggestions put forward in Prio* s very interesting note. Powie did^ mention while he was here that the Persian schools in Bahrein, which he gave us to understand were centres of disaffection, were not under the control of idle Bahrein Education Authority, and that the same is true of the schools controlled hy the American missionaries. There seems a good deal to he said for remedying this state of things so far as the Persians are concerned, though if we were to bring them under the control of the Bahrein Education Authority it would, of course, he necessary to do the same for the Americans. But action on these lines ought, on the face of it, to be easy to justify on j general grounds, either to the Persians! or to the u.s.

He also susges.s the possihiUty of retaliation on certain lines. I reel extremely doubtful whether in present circumstances His Majesty's Government would he prepared to sanction any action of this kind, since it is clear that for the a^ent *uey are all out fbr saaintaining the status quo and avoiding any kind of provocative action against the Persians for fear the latter will turn ana rend us over Henjatfl and Basidu, where they are on very strong ground and aould demand our withdrawal, if they wish to he really nasty. Apart however from ohe question whether any such acoion is admissible on political grounds, it has also to be considered whether retaliation of the kina suggested by Prior would be practicable and effective, it is on this point that 1 would like your opinion before we decide whether to make any recommendation in this sense to she Inaia Office, 2 . $e should also be glad if you would explore further your interesting suggestion for the settlement of 'Persian' Bahrainis on the west side of the Island (presumably in the lands at Budaiyya deserted recently by the Dowasir tribe).

The prospect of an improvement in the finances of Bahrain and of the development of irrigation from artesian wells, seems to offer an excellent opportunity for consideration of a project of this kind, and we shall he glad to hear whether on further review of the details you still think your scheme to Be practicable. 3* X liiay aaa that so far w© have not Been asked to comment on the Foreign Office letter referred to above nor have we seen my reply from the India Office to the Foreign Office.

The Hon s ble Lieut.Col. £oruon Loch, Offg. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.SQaLQOioxi. 10 divide persons of Bahrain origin in Persia into three categories :~ vl) those who ovai landed propt 3 rty, (2) Bahrainis born in Persia, and (3) those who were born in Bahrain. As regards the first we can do nothing for them and hi ere is no objection to telling them so on every possible occasion, nor can there be any difficulty in explaining this to the bviaikh, iis regards the second, since Bahrain has now published a proclamation that persons born in Bahrain of foreign parents ivoulu, unless registered in the igency, ba considered as subjects oi trie Bahrain State, we could, I think, persuade the Sheikh that it is unreasonable to expect us to do anything for Bahrainis born in Persia, since I do not think that these people have ary real claim on us* They intend to remain in Persia, they are usually married in Persia am since they are bom there, Persians have every right to consider them as sons of die soil* It is true that foreigners in Bahrain can register and avoid Bahrain nationality, but the fact remains that Persians do not. We are now left with the third category of persons born in Bahrain who genuinely belong to it and for these we must make an attempt to do something. The question of retaliation was taken up by Sir Hugh Biscoe in his Despatch No. 235-S., dated the 5th May 1931 wherein he suggested that we should withdraw the Capitulations from the Persians in Bfihrain and subject them to the local courts. I told Sir Hugh at the time that I thought his idea was mistaken and that it would hit us more than the Persian Government in as much as it would reduce the power of the Political Agent over an important section of the community, and that it was impracticable in that most of the Persians in Bahrain spoke only Persian and could not be subjected to courts whose officers spoke nothing but Arabic* I also pointed out that since the act of with- drawing Capitulations could only take place once, it would have only a temporary effect and tiiat once the Persians had forgottenforgotten about its effect would be lost r + , othar hand thnt n . * 1 su ^ s t,ed, on the -dom 7^y '* U ' rag *• * -isible siB „ to ', H ' PerMa “ B0h “ 13 l&lt;i '“ »» &gt;i*»i&lt;ii«od fr. p er ,^„ ” B :‘ ,ra '' “ M aU “i'e a valuable cono„„io„ that aH^n “ TI t ° ler ‘ tS ‘ n ^ *««*«» - «ob would th -1 the p' ^ n 1 ° 8 ‘ &gt;ly 11 na,im - 11 “d‘ !&gt;« renanbered -t toe Persian Cnvemoont have fe , ^ ^ subjects and care little tor *at loss they cause the. in ouppoitinfi their pride. In fact in cutting off their nose to spioe their face, tliey are past masters. They would not therefore, worry very much about retaliation that only affected fch0ir ressortl83ants Pockets, but retaliation that affected their national pride would make them squirm. Moreover, such retaliation would be a continuous one and every Pahlvi cap removed would be a fresh reminder of the Sheikh's piwer over their nationals in Bahrain. Sir Hugh, however, disagreed with my vieis and did not forward my despatches and his own suggestion ^as abandoned, I think quite ri^itly, on the ground that it would do us more harm than good* I would suggest therefore, that we should not abandon the possibility of retaliation* We should allow the Sheikh to say that if Bahrain subjects in Persia with Bahrain nationality papers (we would understand this as referring only to persons of the third category) were molested he would consider the withdrawal of the privilege of allowing Persians to maintain separate schools in Bahrain and also that he would abolish the Pahlavi cap as an emblem which had become intolerable to him. If this vras conveyed to the Persian Government at the right moment, it would, I think, have a decided effect, for they know that they are powerless to interfere in what happens in Bahrain. If the persecution continued, the schools (which are a confounded nuisance) could be closed one by one and the question of the Pahlavi cap could be taken up later. I think that these two, and particularly the Pahlavi cap, would he ve a real efiect on the Persian Government and if the Minister were to drop a hint to tliis effect verbally it would be possible to gauge its effect without having to put it into writing and so enable us to resile from the position if we found that the weapon was likely to be useless. ^ In dealing with Persians their pride must never be lostlost signt of, am sense recognised as only a subsidiary factor in their composition. To sum up - (1) We admit that we can do no tiling for Bahrainis with landed property. There is no objection to telling both them and the Shaikh of this. (2) We must get round the clash between our normal obligation to protect the children of British protected subjects and the provision of Hie Persian Nationality law mentioned in sections 4 and 5 of paragraph b of the Foreign Office letter by explaining to the Shaikh th&amp;t we have accepted this position for our own subjects end that moreover the new proclamation in Bahrain has much the same effect. We should also explain that since Bahrainis born in Persia have obviously every intention of remaining there it is in their own interest to accept Persian nationality, though they would still be entitled to Bahrain nationality should they ever return to Bahrain. I see no objection to the Consul at Mohammerah explaining their position on ..or the Persian nationality law to Bahrainis and advising them privately to accept Persian nationality under protest. (3) \ve must make a genuine attempt to protect Bahrainis born in Bahrain and threaten retaliation if cur claim to do this is not admitted. (4) We should make no public announcement of our policy regarding those mentioned in (2) and if retaliation shews itself to be a successful weapon, we should extend our protection to border line cases in this category.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your Express letter Ho C/210 dated the 15th May 1934 regarding the ill-treatment of Bahrainis in Persia. 2. I saw His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin ’Isa Al Khalifa this iporning (l5th July) and put up to him the suggestion made in the letter from His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Moham- merah, Ho 2/79/139 dated the 12th February 1934, regarding the adoption of Persian nationality hy Bahrainis settled in Persia. His Excellency agreed that it was the most suit able answer which c&lt;ku3id have been given and he also said that he would still consider as his subjects any Bahrainis who had registered as Persians. 3. Afterwards I sav; three Bahrainis of Qusbah named, Zair 1 Abood, Saiyid Hadi and Saiyid ’Alawi. These three ra^n had previously seen Captain Chauncy at Mohammerah. I repeated his suggestion to them and care nily refrained from expressing any hopes that the matter would he settled quickly, hut I sugg s^ed to them that in view of +he fact that they would not lose their Bahreini status outside .... outside-- -s- ■ 74. outside Persia and tMt the;/ would be relieved of trouble inside Persia, two years' military service which their sons would have to undergo night he worth considering. 4. They as Iced me why subjects of Sing Bin Sa’ud were not treated in the same way as they had been and why they should be considered as Persian subjects and often registered as Persian subject s without their knowledge. Before I replied I found that they knew of the dispute between the British Go vernment and Persia regarding the etajms 0 f Bahrain. I endea voured to explain to them the Persian Nationality Law and that their oosition was made more difficult by this dispute. I an afraid that they did not seem to understand what* was meant by a nationality law and they considered that as they were the subjects of His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin ’Isa A1 Khalifte and under our protection the 3 r could not be Persian stibjects as well. 5. I am forwarding under Printed Letter two further petitions received regarding the treatment of Bahrainis in Persia. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your Most obedient servant, Sd/- M. Worth I.C.S.

On the other hand, there is no reason why we should not protest in the case of any Bahreini who, so far as we are aware, aoes not fall within these categories, and from the documents enclosed in Tehran despatch on P.Z.3265/34 it seems more than prodadle that there was no question of aual nationality in the case of tne two victims of the recent incidents at Guzdah, whose case is there discussed (Foreign Office in their d.o. letter of 29th fey, on P.Z.3604/34, have v/tvAKj Kfh (rC indeed suggested that the case i^s-.niTb^watertight.

Reference Foreign and iolitical Department nx^ress Letter Fo.F.lOl-K/34, dated the 30th May 1934. 2. The main point at issue dealt with in Foreign Ofi 1 ice letter referred to is the extent to which His Majesty’s Govern- ment can espouse the c.- use of Bahrainis in Persia who are ill- treated by the Persian Government. 3. As is pointed out in paragraph 2 of the Foreign Office letter ««.£ 2623/1561/91 of 9th May 1934 certain assumptions have of recent years been made in this connection which are summarised as follows? (1) That His Majesty's Government were legally justified in espousing the cause of the Bahrainis resident in Khu^istan, ( 2 )/ (Signature) s. 44. DCFP—1124S&amp;P—(M”!3I4.)—4-8“32'~12,000. ( Designation)( 2 ) That the troubles of these Bahrainis were attributable chiefly it not wholly to the dispute regarding the Persian Government's claim to Bahrain, and (.3) ihat these people would cease to oe molested if the Persian Government could be induced to renounce that claim. 4. ^hat does, as pointed out in Foreign Gif ice letter under reference, nullify these assumptions is the fact that by the Persian nationality Law (paragraph 4 of Foreign Office letter) even if the Persian claim to Bahrain were withdrawn, it would still be open to the Persian Government to claim Bahrainis * in Persia under the said Law. From another point of view, too, (Foreign Office letter, paragraph 6 )eVon if the iersian Govern- i meat agreed to regard the Bahrainis in Persia as foreigners, those concerned who own land would lose their means of liveli hood, since foreigners are not allowed to hold real estate in Persia# S. There Is no actual Bahrain Nationality Law. Neverthe less it may be assumed that even without such a law Bahrainis. (on the analogy ef 'jus soli') have a claim to be Bahrain subjects. This, however, does not help very much, since, whatever their claims may be, as pointed out in paragraph b oi Foreign Office letter, most Bahrainis in ;-ersia would be of dual nationality and while in Persia their master nationality would have to be Persian# TMr. «.t b. however »«.

All residents in Bahrain fall under two main categories i&amp;/ subjects of his Excellency the Shaikh of Bahrain, aiiu (b) foreigners. In the case of (b) foreigners born in Bahrain are treatea in Bahrain ss Bahrain subjects unless they specifically divest themselves of Bahrain nationality by having their names entered in a Register kept by the Bahrain Agency# 4. There is in Bahrain no law (other than the rule quoted aooTs) by winoit nationality can b® judged, but in a small place /whereproceedings and civil suits) between themselves to the Bahrain Courts. &gt; 3 Persons in category (b) foreigners (including persons | L;ve recourse in cases between tiiemselves to the Agency Courts.

Ihen a foreigner (including a person born in Bahrain of foreign pirents and registered in the Agency) institutes a complaint or brings a suit against a Bahrain subject (including s person born in Bahrain of foreign parents but not registered in the Agency), the natter is dealt with toy a Joint Court. I regret a slight reminiscence of a scene in ’Alice in Wonderland f , but it is really quite easy to work the system in practice. 6. If it is thought desirable to reply to the Persian Oriental Secretary's letter of the 16th May in detail, I would suggest the attached redraft of paragraphs 3 snd 4 of the original draft. I venture, however, to think that, as the / uestion98 3. question of Treaty negotiations is for the present in abeysnce, j;is Excellency Ehaikh Hamad would prefer that as little as possible should be communicated about Banr&amp;in to the Persian Government who, in his liew as an independent Ruler, have no concern in the internal administration of Bahrain, where Persians receive kindly treatment and where it is open to any aggrieved Persian to seek redress in properly constituted Courts. I should, therefore, myself prefer, as interpreting the Bahrain point of view, to see thereply confined to the last paragraph of the original draft. I have the honour to be Sir, Tour moat obedient servant,Beuraft. 2* All Hesidmts in Bahrain fall under one of two eateries (a) subjects of His Excellency the Shaikh of Bahrain (including persons born in Bahrain of for- oign parents, v/ho nave not registered their m,mu in the Agency as wishing to continue to be treated as foreigners) and (b) foreigners, &gt; 3* Category (a) nave recourse to the Bahrain Courts of Justice.

I should perhaps explain, with regard to the last sentence of the draft reply enclosed in this despatch, that Hoare has not consulted us on this point in separate papers. He doubtless felt that to send us the draft for our concurrence was a sufficiently clear method of consulting us. 3 . The despatch was of course written at a time when Hoare still hoped that we would authorise his proposals for taking a strong line with the Persians. Our present policy is, however, to he as unprovocative - - *• - , .Y.R 5 JULW4 ’ LiTlO/vL ’ INDIA OFFICE cG ;-7 sent TO-^Ea&amp;^R., J. G. lailihwaite, Esq. as NT BY AjJ u OFFICEm as possible. But quite apart from this, we feel that it would be advisable to omit the last paragraph of the draft. It may perhaps be said that we could hardly be more unsuccessful than we are at present in our efforts to help Bahrainis in Persia. We are, however, under an obligation to the Sheikh of Bahrain to conduct his relations with foreign countries, including Persia; and when our own current relations with Persia are fairly good, and someone of goodwill such as Peroughi is at the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs, a certain amount of satisfaction - or at least explanation - can occasionally 1 . oM.ln.d »» *»• M “~ 1 - officlal •stnods on t »astio». concerning the inter.... Of the Sheikh. We think, therefore, that it would be a mistake to take the initiative in making this impossible for the future, as would almost certainly the case if the final paragraph of the draft were allowed to remain. 4 . Further, though .hi. particular c.rr,.po»d.nc „ . a n rs i„, the P.r.lan. night conceivably, only concerns Bahrain, wishingn v/ishing to go one tetter than us, refuse in future to entertain semi-official representations regarding the alfairs of any of the Arah Sheikhs; and we should he in a weak position vis-a-vis of our Arah proteges if we had to admit that, owing to our own action, we were no longer in a position to represent their views to the Persian Government in any shape or form. 5. Finally it is perhaps worth while pointing out that in this business of Bahrain nothing is ever quite H on all fours”, for the simple reason that while Persia claims Bahrain, Bahrain does not claim Persia. Owing to this lack of symmetry, tu quoque retorts of the kind suggested in the last paragraph of the draft are never entirely watertight. 6 . We propose, therefore, subject to your concurrence, to tell Hoare that the letter as drafted can now he sent to Mo’ tamed!, but with the omission of the last paragraph. r— US -JLu. tt -rw LirM ^ / 1/ to ^ £&gt;~r ^ xMo* 263.

My dear Friend, In the course of the examination of some of the private correspondence addressed to my predecessor, Mirza Mohammad Khan Snayesteh, my attention has been drawn to a letter addressed by Mr. Baggellay on Tir 24th, 1312 (July 15th, 1933) to hi® (Mina ICohammad Khan Shayecteh) on your behalf on the subject of the notifications which were published some time ago in Bahrein as a result of the enforcement of the provisions of whl.li a number of Persian war*ere had been dlsiriseed from the service of the Oil Company in Bahrein. 2 . Mr. Baggallay, in his letter, pointed out two point, to wnieh, X think, replies should have been given at the times- ^ *„ statement made to the effect that 1.

A« regards til© statement made in your letter mention* i '^ ove to eI ^©ot tnat the Oil Company in Bahrein is an entirely private concern and that the Government of Bahrein no control over its policy as regards the recruitment or discharge of workmen, or in any other way, I find it necessary to inform you that apart from the fact that the operations of the Company in exploiting the sources of oil in Bahrein and taking profits therefrom are protested against by the Imperial Government, both rightly and justly, and that the facts have already been notified to the honours!) le Legation by the Ministry for foreign Affairs in the note No. 11660 of Murdad let, 1509 (July 23rd, 1950), you will, no doubt, agree that the dismissal of Persian workers fro® the establishments of the Company is in itself an unjust gesture and is an example of the scries of restrictions and the pressure which are being exercised in those regions with a view to strangle the sentiments of the Persians and to make them reluctant to retain Persian nationality.

In the &amp;hwaz despatch (No.22 of 27th March) enclosed therein, paragraph 2, Watkinson says that there is no question of dual nationality in the case of the two principal victims, Sayid Russein and Zair Saleh. It certainly seems most probable that these two people were in fact Bahrainis and were not Persians, but it is perhaps worth pointing out nevertheless that, on the facts available, this is no more than a probability, the fathers of these two men were born in Persia, and resided there at the age of eighteen, the sons (i.e. the victims in the present affair) would by Persian law If be G.

A preliminary re-examination of the whole question has, however, led him to doubt whether His Majesty’s Government would be justified in protesting to une Pe _ si an A-oveiniiienu, even in general terms, regarding the recent activities of uhe local Persian authorities; and in view of the fact that the protest would he most unlikely to benefit these Bahrainis in practice, he is of the opinion that before he issues any , 4 ..^-, 4 -n qdr -Repurald Hoare the question of the further instructions to bin Keginaxu -i ,„ pnr ,* r6 o to be carefully reconsidered, status of these people requires 2 . -Ihenever this question has arisen in recent years it has apparently been generally assumed that his Majesty's . , . n asDousing the cause of ^ ^ -lor-niiv lustixiea m ebpuu.aj -115 Government were legaxxj J . 4 - ^ 4 -uot the troubles oi . ■'•huzistan; tnai uuc the Baiirainis resident m h , - -m* Phiefl^ if not wholly to these Bahrainis were attnou^Dr • .rivi unvernment ’ s claim to .u the Persian Oovcrnmcnu the dispute rega-d..n a .. imder . - g U p-a:ested in your lettei umaer 3 jid that (as inaeea is su aD es _ , jahr ain; reply) •••• H11 ^ ( v Phe Under-Secretary of State, India Office.

If, on the other hand, they were found to be nationals not only of Bahrain, but also of Persia, they would possess dual nationality, and, as tn all similar oases elsewhere, their 'master nationality' would be that of the country in which theywere resident - in this case Persia. Phis being so, the utmost that His Majesty s Government would be justified in doing would be to afford them purely unofficial 'good offices' in certain circumstances; and even this small measure of protection could not properly be afforded to them if their only complaint were that they were ■bein'' treated lihe other Persian nationals in such matters . . ,.. n et0 m neither of the cases as conscription, registration, etc. thp action taken be of practical contemplated above would the acuion benefit to these people, since even if the Persian Govern^ were t0 oease to claim them as Persian nationals in virtue o ; I', Persian claim to Bahrain, it would seem open to the Persian possessing Persian nationality rasrard them as possessiio Government to ,e u ^ ^ which oase , as p 4-up ^©vsiaii national!

His ila^esty’s Consul at Ahwaz tas stated in his despatch No. 10 of the 6th February to His [ajesty^ Minister at Tehran (a copy of which was sent to the ;ndia Office under cover of Foreign Office letter lo. F 1895/1561/91 of the 11th April) that the Bahraini immunity at Mohammerah and Gush ah 'has been settled there 'for the most part for several generations'; and that only some 500 or 400 out of a total of 4,000 are at present in possession of Bahraini papers of nationality'. Simon is not aware of the existence of any Bahraini nationality law, and I am to enquire whether any such lav; las teen enacted. If there is no such law, it appears 10 definite ruling can he given as to the number of generations born outside Bahrain who can justifiably be regarded as Bahraini nationals. ) ' Ld61 however, at present under consideration which defines what 4 .n-n p' fT*i toric s nr€• j^iitiwi- persons emanating from caitam + . - pv^ons and lays down the principle that British pr o t e c t e a pe r s o no, anc. - ^ •tt i,p pn loved by the natives of these protection will be j , children of the first generation born territories ana oy c.ni • -noh'-'ain not being a Brit is outside these territories.

Under tip -p p ^ a • o . . ^ d Je ^sian nationality law of the 7th September 1929 tip -^n . t-,e following persons are deemed to be Persian subjects:- (1) All residents of Persia with the exception of - ose whose foreign nationality is established. The foreign nationality of a person is considered as established when his documents of nationality ■ nc - eojeetc . uo by the Persian Government. (5) All those persons whose fathers are Persian, whether those persons were born in Persia or abroad. (3) Those born in Persia of unknown parents. (4) Those born in Persia of foreign parents one of whom was born in Persia. h (5) Those born in Persia whose fathers are foreign subjects, but who at the time of reaching the age of eighteen are residing in Persia. i (6) All foreign women who marry a Persian husband. (7) All foreign subjects who have obtained Persian nationality. Even, therefore, if the Persian claim to Bahrain were withdrawn, thus rendering sections 1 and 2 inapplicr-xc , would still be open to the Persian Government to claim these people as Persian subjects under Sections (4) and/or (5), and to argue that though possibly the ancestors of these people were non-Persians, their present-day descendants, . . 'p a r*o t g, and of fathers themselves born for the most part m Persia ana u -i n not be regarded as other than Persian born in Persia, could no^ oe . -poronan lav; is in accordance subjects. This provision oi Pexsran - the ius soli on which many nationality with the principle ox. tne j— —125 ¥ laws are based, and could not be successfully challenged in the event of an appeal to an international tribunal. 6 . Meanwhile, looking at the matter from quite another angle, it must be remembered that even if contrary to expectation, the Persian Government in such circumstances failed to use this argument, and. agreed to regard the 'Bahrainis' in Persia as foreigners, the immediate effect would be to deprive of their means of livelihood the not inconsiderable proportion of these people who own agricultural property, since foreigners are not allowed to hold real estate in Persia. 7 . It is conceivable that in the proposed Anglo- Persian general treaty settlement, should it eveT be concluded, a special clause might be inserted, enabling persons (of whatever age) resident in Persia and claiming Bahraini descent on the father's side to opt xoi the .ncmishment of Persian nationality within a given emiOv.. in view of the Persian Government's preoccupation with onri rtf their natural oh^eotioi. problem of 'man-power', and ox men ;he presence of large permanent colonies of foreigners on r soil, it may he taken as certain that a proposal to increase considerably the already ,rt such a clause would increase -p 4-v-xs freatv iiQg'OtxS&lt;^fOUS. lid able difficulties ox the treat, 8 r he national status of these so-called , hen t0 M briefly that while their irainis' appear3, ^e.-, - - . -i • q in tiii0 it to claim Bahraini national , - _ _ . , their Persian nationality m ^ is very doubtful, * - nnail7 . , n p n 0W , and v;ould be eq.nali u Persian law is indispu , ; t0 wi thdraw her claim to Bahiaix.

Unmesty 1 s are Persian subjects and nothing else. as indicated in paragraph 3 above. His Government are unable to afford any degree protection to British subjects of dual nationality resident in the foreign State of which they are also nuun-viAais; L ' ie utmost that can be done is where circumstances of real hardship exist, to make purely unofficial representations if there seems to be a reasonable chance of their being favourably received and producing effect. in the present instance it seems (although the facts have been denied by the local authorities) that cases of great hardship, resulting in one case in death, have occurred. There is, on the other hand, no chance of unofficial representations being favourably receivec, and Sir John Simon doubts whether any should be made. 10. On the assumption that the foregoing exposit ’ on of the legal position is accepted, as co.i icGl, .t may yet he argued that the assurances once furnished by 'eAmourtache in this connexion render a deviation from tne strictly logical course possible, while the policy which lis Uajesty T s Government have hitherto pursued renders such a deviation desirable.

I Please see previous submission on P.z.1814/31 atout Ill-treatment ol Bahrelnie 6y tn, Persian authorities at GuShah. in, p as t history or this question is conveniently suirmarlsed In tr. Anderson's niinute at P.Z.7745/31. 0. The present trouble arises from the renewed attempt of the Persian authorities to compel sjahreinis resident in Persia to take out Persian nationality documents. We have now received the views of the Political Resident (P.z.2130/34), h.M. , Minister at Tehran (P.z.2439/34 and 2440/34) and the Government of India (P.Z.2569/34). There now seems to te general agreement as to the inadvisability of adopting retaliatory measures against Persians resident in Bahrein, since even if such measures were desirable on other grounds they would be extremely unlikely to effect the object of putting an end to the oppression of Bahreinis in Persia. The Political Resident has tentatively suggested the alternative of using the. threat of publicity with the Persian Government which was used with success a few years ago in the case of an Indian who was flogged at Charoar. mere is considerable force, however, in the Government of India’s view that the circumstances of the charbar case were entirely different and that the Persian Government might even welcome publicity in the case of Bahrein in order to ventilate their own grievances. . in these circumstances there seems nothing to be done except to make a further protest to the Persian Government, though this is perhaps unlikely to have any more effect than previous protests. The present- 2 - etXjt position is most unsatisfactory, put we may agree with of India the Government/ihat no final solution of the question is possible so long as the Persians maintain that Bahrein is part of Persia and Bahreinis Persian subjects. 4. Prom the enclosure to the latest Tehran despatch (P.zj#2bb4/ / 34) it seems possible 'that the local Persian authorities have for the moment ceased attempting to ±orce Bahreinis to take out Persian nationality documents, though in view of past experience we cannot be optimistic that this position will continue for long. 30 long as the Persians maintain their claim uo Bahrein it is clear, as the Government of India and sir Reginald Hoare say, that Bahreinis who wish to reside or own land''in Persia would he well advised to adopt Persian nationality and this is the advice which has already been given by the Vice-Consul at tohaameraht we might suggest in our letter to the Foreign Office that in tne event of j a recurrence of the trouble consular officers should bL instructed to advise Bahreinis I nationality— It is assumed that Bahreinis in Persia who adopt Persian nationality will not thereby forfeit their Bahrein nationality, but we may await Colonel Fowle's confirmation of this, which has been asked for by Sir R. Hoare in naragraph 6 of his despatch of .r , / P Ch 0i bth “wch (P.Z. 24259/34). 6 ' , , ^ t0 th » OttlM that h.h. 1 mister, lehran, should be instructed to protest to the Persian Govemmpn-f- o mmeriu against the ill- treatment of Bahreinis at \ Sba h ^ submittedTr^Gir R seems m some doubt as to how fsr. u , ^ ‘ * ar he sh0 ^ press his ( representations, so it seems desir a w ^^Oiraoie to flair +U i. think the present case important erouii t • ^ ^ a ° ' 1 -OUgh to justify provoking a eerious rapture Wlth t er sian Government.

While the Secretary of State considers that H.M.

After perusing this 0 » @ 2^0 Despatch and also Tehran Despatches Hos. 112 and 117 on the same subject, the Government of India are of opinion that no final solution of this question is possible unless and until the Persian Government abandon their claim to Bahrein and admit the separate existence of Bahrein nationality. It i* clear that such an admission can only be secured as the result of the conclusion of a . tj is i&amp;Liesty^s Government and the general treaty between His isaje j wv-&gt;nr'Vi a^neara unlikely to be achieved Persifi'i* Government &gt; whic PP* ^ 4 . rt therefore remains to be considered in the near future.

It will clearly be necessary to maXe representations to the Persian Government, but as regards the form of these representations I have little to add to the observations contained in my earlier despatch. The way in which the matter is to be handled must depend upon the view which His Majesty's Government take of these proceedings and of the length® to which they are prepared to go in order to obtain reparation. « jn the meanwhile I enclose a copy of a further despatch froa His Majesty's Consul at Ahwaz reporting- the advice given by His Majesty's Vice-Consul at Mohammerah to the Bahreinis of Gusbah. captain Chaunoy’e advice appears to ae to be admirable in every way, and if the Bahreinis had followed it much of this trouble might have been averted.

Sir, In continuation of my despatch No. 2/29/106 dated the 3rd February 1934, I have the honour to report that several Bahreinis have again dome to me to say that after leaving them alone for about a week the Governor of Gusbah has again commenced to harass them. in addition these men report that there are two clerks from the Persian Census Department who, assisted by Amnieh Guards, are forcibly taking theifci thumb prints on declarations of Persian Nationality, and issuing them with ,, Sijills ,, accordingly. Several men who have resisted have been beaten. One of the men who appeared before me showed me marks on his chest which he stated were the results of blows from the Amnieh Guards. They assert that they have been warned if they come to me again, their houses will be burnt down. 2c I have informed those men who came here that I have reported the whole matter, and that, pending its settlement, if they are harassed any more they must take Sijills to protect themselves, but to do so only as a last \\ resort. I pointed out that provided they have registered themselves in Bahrein, the fact of taking Persian Sijills now under pressure should not prejudice their claim to Bahrein Nationality when the whole question is settled, moreover that with a Sijill there is nothing to prevent their going to Bahrein should they wish to do so, and once in Bahrein they could throw away their Sijills and be Bahreinis. I stressed the point that as Bahreinis they could not hold /landed His Majesty 1 s Consul for Khuzistan, A h w a z.- 2 - 47 landed property i n Persia, so th= + so that they must weigh up the • in P.,... .„ a b « 0&gt;to! . p „ sl&gt;n ^ ^ whether th w couU gI „ up ^ ^ ^ ^ Bahreinis. 2 - I was very careful to say that the foregoing was own ides on 'the ie subject and no one else's, and that no guarantee went with it t+ ^ - ltn it * 1% was simply that at present they were receiving ill-treatment at the hands of the Persians and that if this continued and it became imperative to do something at once, in my own opinion, 'hat I had said was the best thing to do, since nothing else could be done quickly enough. I added that the only drawback to taking a dual nationality was that while they remained in Persia their sons would be faced with two years compulsory service in the Persian Army, and that since all their interests lay in Persia, this was a very small price to pay for what they received from Persia.

X received in reply one of the discourteous and disobliging communications upon which His Excellency seems to pride himself, but since I received information simultaneously that the molestation of th® Bahreinis had ceased X hoped that, though refusing to take action, His Excellency had in fact done so and X therefore decided to ©ay no more. I now learn, however, that the molestation has started again and I hare accordingly addressed a further letter to Hie Sxeelleney.

Of these three thousand the majority, according to the information contained in Mr. Watkinson’s despatches, possess Persian nationality under the Law of September 7th, 1929, quite apart from the Persian claim to Bahrein. In a sense this fact places them in exactly the same position as regards the protection of His Majesty's Legation and Consulates as other persons possessing dual Persian and foreign nationality while resident in Persia; but it must be remembered that in their case they would not have been allowed by the Persian Government to take advantage of the supplementary article^ 1 of October 21st, 1930, even if they had tried to do so, which I doubt whether any of them did. There are thus some grounds for claiming that, politically speaking, the provisions of the Persian nationality law should not be held to apply to these Bahreinis and that at any rate they should be allowed to take advantage of the now time-expired supplementary Article 1 whenever the question of Bahrein is settled. 5 # Apart, however, from theoretical /considerations,consideration*, it aeema to « that those Bahreinis who ere permanently settled m herein would serve their own interests best by accepting Persian nationality. Th ey might do so the more readily if they could be assured in the name of the Bahrein Government that they would not forefelt their Bahrein nationality by doing so, and I would welcome a statement on this point by the Political Resident, to whom I am sending a copy of this despatch. ? * ^ith those Bahreinis who own agricultural land (possibly a large number of those resident at Guebah) I do not think His Majesty’s Government need greatly concern themselves* The land-owning Bahreinis have, I believe, been warned by a succession of Political Residents that the ownership by foreigners of agricultural land (which includes date gardens) is against the law of Persia and that they cannot have things both ways* When it ease to the point few of them would, I fancy, give up their land in preference to accepting Persian nationality, in spite of the assertions of the deputation which called on Captain Ohauney at Mohan®erah on January 31 st. 1 am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign.

H, Hoare.No. 2/29/100. British Vice-Consulate, Moiiammerah. February 1 st, 1934 . Sir, X Have the honour to report that three men representing themselves to be subjects of Bahrein residing in Ousba 0 p peare(i before ffle ye3terciay&gt; namee are Makki bin Mohammed, Jasim Bin Ali, Eswaid bin Jasim. The first named stated that he had not brought his certificate of Bahrein nationality with him. The remaining two produced certificates bearing the seal of the Financial Adviser to the Government of Bahrein. The last named, Eswaid, also produced certificates in the names of Salim, Adhbi and Mahmood whom, he stated, were his brother and who were in the same difficulty as he was. 2 * THe story which they tell is as follows:- Seven days ago, the Governor of Gusba sent for ten Bahreinis and two days ago for about thirty more, and warned them that if they did not register themselves as Persian subjects within a week they would be imprisoned. Three Bahreinis were placed in confinement in a room within the Governorate by order of the Governor three days ago. The remainder fear imprisonment at any moment, 3 . I have spoken with the men, and asked them if tfe they are aware of the Persian law forbidding foreigners to own property in Persia. They say that they are awaee of this and that many of them are ready to give up their land and property and return to Bahrein but that the Persian authorities will not allow them to go. In fact they have no choice other than between imprisonment or Persian nationality. writing the above, two other Bahreinis have arrived from Gusba with a petition which they declare represents the case of three thousand of them. It is stated in this petition that the Governor is now taking their /Bahrein U'lBahrein nationality certifioatee from them by force and announcing that those who have not registered as Persians in three days will be imprisoned. These two men go on to state that they have already been imprisoned but have been released on condition that they become Persians by to-morrow. b * 1 have sent ray interpreter to Gusba to make discreel inquiries, and, as he happens to he a personal friend of the Governor there, I have told him, if he finds the above reports true, to request the Governor to stay his hand pending a reference to Tehran. I am of the opinion that as there has been a recent change of Governors in Gusba, that the present Governor is acting in ignorance of the position, and unless he has had ; very recent instructions from higher quarters, it should not be difficult for my interpreter to persude him to wait, more especially as he got into trouble some time ago in Lingah for rauoh the same action as he is taking now.

Sir, In continuation of my despatch Mo. 2/29/100 of 1st February, I have the honour to report that my interpreter Mirza Abbas Parei, returned from Ouebah on the evening of tne 2nd instant. His inquiries confirmed the stories reported in my despatch referred to above and he therefore visited the Governor of Gusbah. 2. The Governor informed Miraa Abbas that he had not received any instructions from Tehran nor did he propose asking for any. He stated that the n Si;}ill” authorities had requested him to assist them in getting the villagers to register themselves. He therefore ordered the Amnieh autnorities to send or take any villager not in possession of a ’'Sijil-i~ah\var ! to the office of the ft Sijill ,e department. There was no question of Bahreinis in particular, but the order covered all persons not in possession of proper documents. Various people had refused to register themselves as Persians on the plea that they were Bahreinis. Some of them produced certificates of nationality issued by the Government of Bahrein. As these documents could not be recognised by him, the Governor declared that people holding them would either have to take out 'Slaills” or be dealt with according to law. 3. On Mirza Abbas’s request the Governor undertook to give those who possessed Bahrein certificates ten days grace during which time he would instruct the Amnieh not to interfere with them. Others, even though they stated they were Bahreinis, would have to take out Si Jills • Alter the expiry of ten days he could do no more for us.

I think, however, that even those without documents will be left alone for the next ten days as it is quite impossible for the Governor to imprison two and a half thousand people, and I think his readiness to give ten days grace may be accounted for either by the fact that he is himself referring to Tehran or, realising he is wrong, is gently withdrawing his forces. I have told the Bahreinis who came to me that the matter Is being dealt with by the British authorities and that they must now return to Gusbah and only come to me again if there is any further trouble.

I have the honour to refer to my letter No, 302»d of 8th March 1834. Before giving sry views on the present situation as reported by ms Majesty's Consul, Afawas, L should like to take this opportunity of review ing the whole question as it appears to se personally. Hie Majesty's Minister has already been unofficially informed of my views. 2. The oppression by the Persian Government of Bahrainis consists in conscription, the forced accept ance of Persian nationality, the confiscation of pass ports and other fora® of pressure, of which the most acute issue is conscription. 3. The Bahrainle who are most affected live in the Ahwas consular district which include® Mohasmerah. The number of Bahrainis who live in this district is approximately about 8000, of which about 2300 own agricultural property, thus Isavlng about 8700 non property owners, nasely, Moharoerah 1700, 'usher, and suburbs Including Abadan about 4000, the balance being187 being women and children. Those who own agricultural property have no claim on our assistance unless and until they divest themselves of their property, aho should/be protected by ua so far as we are able. » ^ ince our protests to the Fereisn doveinrssnt on behalf of Bahrainis have been unavailing the question of retaliatory measures against Persian subjects in Bahrain has been considered in the past by various authorities from time to tine. For instance, in para* graph 10 of his letter of 5th May 1931 3lr Hugh Biscoe proposed that Persians in Bahrain should be treated as Bahrain subjects, Mr Dodd in hie letter of 9th Septem ber 1931 said that this was not logical. Sir Hugh Biscoe. however* in paragraph 2 of his despatch of the 6th November 1931, explained that all he meant ms that the Persians in Bahrain should be subject to the Juris diction of the Bahrain courts in exactly the same way as British subjects are subject to the Persian courts. This proposal Sir Hugh Biecoe made with the object of bringing pressure to bear on the Persian Sovemment to give better treatment to Bahrainis in Persia. ■.'Xl&amp;a faci a it would be quite reasonable for us to say to the Persian Government: 'In spite of our pagteste you continue to oppress the Bahrainis in Persia who are under our protection. It is unreasonable for you therefore to expect us to protect your subjects in Bahrain. And in fact we are going to do so no longer.

This being so, there is no doubt that the Persian Government will persist in their efforts to turn Bahrainis into Persian subjects, and if we are to influence the Persian Government by reprisals, the latter will I think have to be severe X and prolonged, and of such a nature that neither His Majesty's Government, nor Indeed the Shaikh, who is a humane .‘nan, could countenance. 6, As pointed out la ay previous letter this question has again reached a critical form, the Persian Government having renewed their oppression with appa rently greater severity than ever, which has resulted in brutal treatment of.Bahrainis causing the death of one and the maltreatment of another. ‘Ih&amp;tever may he the Persian Law in the matter there is certainly no aw by which such treatment can be meted out to individuals.

I presume that (X) is of old standing and applicable to all foreigners over whoip Political Agent has jurisdiction* As regards (s) I should propose to reply that Oil Company is American and. that any way if Government of Bahrain are pressing it to dismiss foreigners they are only copying the Persian Government themselves in their dealings with the Anglo-Per si an Oil Company. I should be glad of information by despatch on both points.
