Michael Hanna Shaikh, a partner in the ilanna 2 Shaikh River Transport Company, has already approached His Majesty's Consul General to enquire whether His Majesty's Government would have any objection to the establishment of an Iraqi Shipping Line by himself and certain associates. His Majesty's Consul General has been informed, in reply to a request for instructions, that there can be no question of objection to such a project by His Majesty's Government but that in view of the doubtful economic value of such a line of ships run by Iraqis in competition with infinitely more experienced shipowners no encouragement should be given. Secretary to the Political Resident in ffie Persian Gulf. ;o the Po ffie PersTheue is an interesting news about a proposal to form an Iraqi shipping company* Mr* Albert G* Asfar has been consulted by the Ministerial Committee as an expert on the subject and has put before them a plan for the formation of a company| of which the main points are as follows « - The shares of the company should be limited to ID. 2 1 000 . OCX) • The company would buy six ships at first 9 the freight of each not to be less than 6 f 000 tons. As a financial guarantee, some of these ships would be mortgaged with London companies, through the Baltic Exchange, a method practised by the most famous and rich world shipping companies* Shares to be offered on the market, 51 per cent to Iraqis only and the remaining 49 per cent to Iraqis and foreigners together* No sale or transfer of shares to others would be performed without the consent of the managing committee* If subscriptions within one year from the date of issue of shares did not reach ID* 2*000,000 the remainder of shares would be mortgaged by the Privy Jurse. at an interest not exceeding 2i per cent per annum* The Privy Purse would have the right to sell the mortgaged shares, keeping in mind that not more than 49 per cent of the issue total is to be sold to foreigners* British shipping companies in Iraq who have sea lines, like Stricks, Grey Mackenzie and African and Eastern should be urged to buy shares, in order to prevent competition and . to pave the way for the Inclusion of the Iraqi shipping company in the pool now organised by the leading foreign shipping companies* A managing committee of five persons, would be selected from snare-holders, under the supervision of the Communica tions Ministry, the number of Iraqis so selected not to be less than three out of five. Co-operation of the Managing Committee with British shipping companies in Iraq* Members of the Iraqi lanaglng Committee would have the right to amend, post; one or reject decisions taken by a foreign firm navigating an Iraqi ship* If the managing committee authorised a foreign firm to navigate Iraqi ships, this firm must submit to the former a detailed account of each voyage of an Iraqi ship showing Income and expenses, confirmed by receipts* The Company’s agents abroad must be of wide experience and specialised in shipping work. They should preferably be shipowners who have connections with Iraq and have agents in Iraq, in order to prevent competition* The head office of the company should be in London to fix dates of shipping and consigning, receive payments, repair and clean snips, appoint or dismiss masters and crew, buy or sell or replace ships as necessary and perform every thing connected with the management pf ships, as known and practised by all shipping companies which have sea connections with Iraq* Copied* G* A.*'.FROM TO Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co., Ltd.

January 19 47, Dear Sir, Enclosed we ha ad you for your information a copy of extracts from a personal letter addressed to our Mr. James L. Battey in Busreh from Mr. -^’ord of Bombay Agents setting forth the difficulties the B.I. Company are experiencing in trying to maintain their normal services. Yours faithfully, Ft GRAY MACKENZIE A COY,, LTW iSncls Agents.From: kackinnon Mackenzie &amp; go. Bombay. 12tii. December 1^46. Ve are perturbed at the apparent failure of various interests in the Persian Gulf to realise that the present somewhat attenuated service provided by the British India Company between India and the Gulf in not only the result of circumstances entirely beyond our control, but is as much a matter of concern to the Company as it is to our supporters and the various authorities concerned. Anderson, who, as you know, will be touring the Gulf in January 1947, will, of course, make a particular point of impressing on all concersed that the Company has done and is doing everything possible to cater for the passenger, mail and cargo traffic, but the Managing Agents are very anxious that the fullest publicity should be given, without delay, to the serious difficulties under which the Company continues to labour and the efforts which are befcng made to overcome them. It is possible that shippes and others do not fully realise the extent of the losses suffered by the Company during the war- almost 50^ of the pre-war fleet. In addition ts these losses the serious shortage of tonnage available for commercial employment has been considerably aggravated by the extremely tardy release ef the major portion of the company•&amp; passenger vessels, which are still eperating as Hired Transperl It is also, I feel, necessary te draw the attention of the public te the inevitable delay in refitting released vessels fer commercial service, apart from which surveys and repairs have, inmany instances, been postponed during the War years and the accumulation of these net enly immobilizes vessels for considerable periods but also places a serious strain on the repairing facilities available.Furthermore new passenger tonnage ef a type suitable fer operation on the Gulf could net be built during the war years. In the light ei the afeere facts I hope you will be able to reooTe the apparently general niscenceftien that wii&amp; the end of the War»the Company should hare no difficulty in resuming immediately its pre-war services and facilities and to explain te all the difficulties the Company has to face. While it has no far been possible» due to the difficulties I have mentioned, te afford to the travelling publi the regular and frequent passenger services» which they and the Company both earnestly desire» it must be admitted that during the war years the Persian Qulf was well served as compared with other ports» and recently the company has made a special effort to provide several extra cargo vessels to ensure that the trade is catered for fully. This point, I feel, could, with advantage, be driven heme te these who have net, perhaps, fully appreciated the efforts made by the Company in this direction. As regards new tennage, the Company has since the cessation of hostilities lost no time in placing orders for improved vessels designed te fulfill the requirements of t$Le particular trade, but in this respect, also, the positien has been difficult. Despite the great efforts being made by the ship ubuilding industry in the U.K., it is i»wtiU.ble that the heavy demand fer new tonnage cannot be fulfilled immediately, and all shipping Cempanies are experiencing difficulty in securing early deliveries. As you are aware, however, twe new 14 knot vessels for the Persian Gulf Service will be completed shortly and, according te eur latest advices, we can expect the first sf these vessels te sail from Bombay for the Gulf in February and the ether in March/April 1947.■HIMI mmm mammmm - 3 - ( 1 ) m These twe new. Teasels, with their larger carge and passenger capacities will, undeuhtedly result in a censiderahle iMprevement in the Serrice. I have endeaveured t# give yeu a reugh picture •f the varitus difficulties being experienced by the Coapany, and 1 shall be grateful if yeu will arrange fer yeur Managers te give these peints the widest possible publicity at all perts under yeur ce^pany’s central* it is particularly necessary te raiseve frem the minds ef shipper- and passengers, any impreaeien that the Ceapany is giving preference te ether ef its services at the expense ef the Persian Gulf Service. — BHHBBBBHeSHMMBBSBritish India Steam Navigation Comp, (INCORPORATED IN ENGLAND) TELEGRAPHIC ADDRESS: GRAY.
