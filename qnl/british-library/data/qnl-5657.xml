Introduction The state of the Yemen has an estimated area of 74,000 square miles and a coastline of some 250 miles on the Arabian of J ho 3 Qa * It enjoys a climate strongly differentiated from that prevailing in most part of Arabia because it is everywhere, except on the coast, dominated by high mountamso The coastal plasn is comparatively barren PJ 10 ^dH'kninous regions enjoy a considerable rainfall, and the climate of the table-land, as represented by Sana^a (the capital) which is 7,500 feet above sea-level, may be ca , . G warm-tomperato. The population has been variously estimated to number from under 2 , 000,000 to over 4 , 000 , 000 .

In the Yemen the descendants of the prophet are called Seiyids, and any Seiyid may be in theory a candidate for election to the Imamate: in practice, however, the 'Ulema’* (men of learning)-will either elect him of whom thSy are most vf ral ^ or hl “ wil1 pay th o most. The late Imam made himself an absolute ruler, and interferes constantly in the i f administrations the present Imam is following his predecessor s example.

Hansen, a German engineer employed by the Yemen Government, at Usifere near Ta^izz; it w r as planned to irrigate 220 acres# Mr# Hansen had also been drawing up other schemes for the Hajeriya province of the Yemen, 4# Minerals 1 i Very little is known of the Yemeni mineral resources# There may be a little gold in the highlands; there is c ? r ^ inly C 0 ^P 01 * pyrites and native copper, rock-salt, sulphur, chalk gypsum and alabaster, and coal is also reported# Drilling for^ oil has been carried out at Salif,' but there is no confirmation of oil having been discovered, 5# Industries Manufacturing in Yemen is confined almost entirely to tho handicraft stage for domestic use; the only factory of any consequence is a munitions plant# A pow f er house is being built at Hodeida# Householders have been given to understand that their acceptance of a certain number of fixtures w r ould be compulsory, 6 # Commerce and Trade Few details are available. Tho greater part of all finished goods are imported, as well as a considerable proportion, of foodstuffs. Tho chief exports are hides and skins, and coffee. In *1947 the Yemen .Trading Company was established with a view to encouraging trade by the granting to the company of monopoly rights for kerosene and sugar.

(b) Health There is a hospital at Sana*a with about 300 beds, and from 1937-1943 there was a British Medical Mission in the Yemen. There are also a number of Italian and other Buropean doctors* 10. Bmployment of Foreign Experts Pew Europeans remain in the Yemen, since living conditions are po.or and their work is continually obstructed by the reactionary administration. The Middle Bast Anti locust unit has, however, visited the Yemen several times, and is on good terms with the authorities* Apart from inodical. men, who a?e tolerated for their good work, there are voiy few Europeans in the country, although to—day increasing numbers oi Italian technicians are being employed. About a year ago a request was received from the government ot the Yemen for the recruitment of certain British experts ^doctors and engineers) and for the procurement of certain items of capital equipment. It was agreed that the Crown Agents should act for the Yemen; detailed arrangements howevc nave not resulted, partly owing to political difficulties ^ orn 'kj 10 frontier dispute. Until a more enlightened attitude is taken by the authorities, there is no object in senaing the necessary exports to the Yemen, 11* Development Prospects •I-bf^rmation is extremely scanty, and it is hard to judge whether there are undeveloped resources or not. Prom what is already known, it appears that progress can best be mnde by irrigation schemes designed to increase the area under cultivation. Thorough investigation of mineral resources might also be worthwhile. 12. Recommendation His Majesty’s Government should endeavour to cultivate good relations with, and to obtain the confidence of the Imam and the people of the Yemen. • Eventuallv thev may be assess the &gt;nt r s advice Until thisMIDDLE BA ST OFFIC IA L CO MMITTEE WORKING PARTY The meeting arranged for Monday, 28th November, will now be held at 4 p.m. instead of 3 p.m. in Room 25.

(Hi)(iii) The third or Sout^srn region covers the ^ remaining parts of the Sudan, where the average annual rainfall is more than 600 millimetres. The figures of rainfall continue to increase towards the South, until on the frontier with Uganda they are over 1,200 millimetres per year. The Southern belt may in years to come be economically valuable to the country but at the present time it plays little part in the Sudan’s economic life. Distance from the sea and the costs of transport render its products of little value by the time they roach the port. Soil and crop surveys are now being carried out and it is hoped that with an expansion of agricultural effort this southern area may be made at least self-sufficing. • - (b) Progress made in agriculture The economic plight of the Sudan in the days before the establishment of the present Government was desperate. The agricultural and pastoral population, which had been decimated by long years of famine, disease and armed conflict, was engaged in an unequal struggle against the natural poverty of the country. Living a primitive and precarious life in remote districts and hampered by the absence of any modern means of communication, the people wore often out of reach of help from their own country-men and always from the outside world. The failure of crops in one season brought hunger and two consecutive failures caused famine. The paramount need was for the country and its inhabitants to be equipped with the means to prevent or minimise natural disasters and for the foundations to bo laid on which the best use could be made of all its natural resources. The economic history of the Sudan for the first quarter of the 20th Century was, therefore, one of progressively increased acreage being put under cultivation, of efforts to improve agricultural methods and-of the rapid growth of communications. The material improvements enjoyed by the people as a result could not then' and cannot now bo statistically measured on the basis of consumption per head of the population. Nevertheless a fair impression of the steady raising of the standards of living is given by trade figures. The improvement received ... marked impetus after ^925* when the results of the Gozira scheme (described in annex A) began to be felt. The war years have been followed by a period of unprecedented economic prosperity due to the steady rise in world prices of the Sudan’s agricultural products and the shift of the terms of trade in her favour. (c) Agricultural sch e me s (i) The Gezira scheme (see also annex A) . This scheme now covers' an area of 900,000 acres, and a further extension is planned. The basis of the scheme is the production of a cash crop - cotton - with the aid of a specialised management supplie.d by two Companies.-,- 3 - (ii) The alternativo livolihood schamos. These were designed to provide some 70,000 semi-nomad families whose land was inundated by the construction of the Jebol Aulia dam with a settled way of life. By 1944. 45,000 acres had been settled, and 35*000 more acres have boon planned# As in the Gozira, the cash crop is cotton, but other crops and also livestock are included. The main + ^ e ^ WGen those schemes and the Gezira scheme is hat the Government itself has undertaken the administrative wor from the start; and that no large-scale cultivation machinery is used, but tenants are encouraged to form ploug^■ , cooperatives. (ill) The Gash board. The Gash delta is in the Kassala province adjoining the Eritrean frontier: the river a tt 0 ? the flood is highly charged with silt, ine alluvial land is divided into parcels by low banks and sheet irrigation is practised. The present policy is to n annua Hy about 35*000 acres for cotton; the rest oi the land is put under dura or kept for light grazing. (t v ) The Zando Scheme Capital of about £3 1*000,000 is being sunk in‘scheme known as the 'Zande' scheme in order to hasten the social emergence of one of the less backward of the primitive triboa in the South. The scheme aims at (a) producing ample food (including sugar) (b) the cultivation of cotton for a local spinning and weaving factory, (c) the opening of properly conducted trading centres at which the people will learn to sell their products and buy their needs in exchange for money instead of goods, since their present economy rests on barter. 3# Mineral Resources Geological Surveys and the activities of numerous prospecting companies and individuals over the last 45 years ave revealed no proved mineral resources apart from small quantities of gold. 4« Industry The Sudan is, and must remain, primarily dependent on agriculture. There is a lack of first-class raw materials in any great quantity, and immense distances separate raw materials from factory areas and factory areas from the markets ot the world, thereby providing a prime deterrent to industrial expansion on a grand scale. Another serious obstacle to industrial development is the lack of any form of natural fuel or power. Nevertheless a number of small industries exist. a modern mechanical tannery and a cement factory have been started, and several up to date though small oil pressing mills have boon installed. In addition a large meat-canning factory is under construction: it is managed by Liebigs, should be in operation by 1951 , and has an anticipated throughput of 100,000 head of cattle. 5o-—jrr - 4 5. C oinm area an &amp; T r ado Tho volume of trade in 1-948 reached the record figure of £3 46,000,000 as compared with £3 21,000,000 in 1945. Sudan exports have increased from practically nothing in 1899 to approximately £3 15 &gt; 000,000 in 1947 and £3 24&gt;000, in 1948. Ginned cotton accounted for £16*000,000 of this lattor sum; other notable exports are cotton-seed, gum arable, a variety of agricultural seed crops, camels, cattle, sheep, and hides and skins. Imports have increased in a similar way and in 1947 were £3 16,200,000 and in 1948 £3 22,000,000. 000 6 . Finance (a) General The Sudan falls within the Sgyptian banking system and thus has a strong link with sterling. In view of its economic relations with Great Britain and Egypt, the monetary policy of these Powers is a matter of great importance to the Sudan. The unit of account is the Egyptian pound (£3). divisible into 100 piastres (P.T.), exchangeable at 97.5 piastres to the pound sterling. (b) Budget The budgetary results of the,, government for the past three years have boon 1946.. 1947.. 1948.. • • • • • • Revenue £3 8,288,985 10,141&gt;495 12,782,346 (For comparison) 1939 (c) 5 ? 053,765 Taxation and other revenue Expenditure £3 8 , 207,802 9,434,667 11,320,352 4,890,871 Surplus £3 81,183 706,828 1,461,994 162,894 The main direct taxes in the Sudan are Land Tax, Crop Tax, Animal Tax, House Tax and Business Profits Tax. Those based on crops and animals follow in form the accepted traditions of the country. The main heads of indirect taxation are Customs and Sugar. The basic rate of import duty is.15$ ad valorem. Under the Condominium agreement the Sudan may not impose higher import duties than those in force in Egypt and Egyptian goods have free entry into the Sudan; the latter arrangement has in practice been reciprocated. As regards the goods of other nations, no discrimination is made. The Sudan in effect maintains the policy of the open door in trade*- 5 - Tho import of sugar is a govornmont monopoly and tho profits on its salo aro in tho nature of a consumption duty. Direct and indirect taxes together provide some 40^ ' of tho total revenue, and another 50$ accrues from govornmont or public undertakings, the chief of which are covered by the budgets of the Railways, Irrigation, Posts and Telegraphs, and Agriculture and Forests Departments, U) Government financial position The Sudan Government’s financial position as at 31st December, 1948, was as follows (in round figures) LS Liquid Assets Cash and marketable securities Stocks and accounts receivable Investments and loans 12,300,000 9 , 700,000 1 , 200,000 Deduct: Reserve for Working Capital Less: Current Liabilities .and Commitments 5,600,000 Excess of liquid assets over current liabilities and commitments 12 , 100,000 23,200,000 5,500,000 representing the following reserves: Development Account Railways Capital and Renewals Accounts Price Stabilisation Reserve Reserve for Capital for tho new Gozlra Administration General Reserve 2 , 400,000 4.200.000 1 . 600.000 3 , 500,000 400.000 12 ,100,000 (e) External debt Tho Sudan Government’s external debt at the end of 1948 amounted to LE 12,800,000 of which LS 5,400,000 was due to the Egyptian Government in respect of development advances made, mainly, during the period up to 1920. (f) Prospects . The available reserves are large and sufficiently liquid to enable the Government to press on with its plans for advancing the economic and social life of the country and at tho- 6 - RMPR the same' time to meet emergencies such abnormal Nile flood of 1946, Revenue unfavourable: given internal harmony, material progress are bright. as that caused by the prospects are not the hopes of further 7. Communications (a) toil. The state-owned railways had in 1947 a total length of 2,325 miles: the system comprised a North-South route from Wadi Haifa to Sennar, with a main Eastern branch from Atbara to Port Sudan on the Rod Sea and two other branch lines. (b) Steamer . The state- owned steamer services cover 2,056 miles on the Nile and its tributaries. (c) Port. Port Sudan is a fine and up-to-date port. (d) Air . Steps have been taken by the government to form the Sudan airways, which will provide regular internal services. 8. Social Development (a) Educatl on When the Sudan Government first took over the administration of the Sudan there were no schools or hospitals in the country. All that then existed wore a few native Koranic schools which were run on the narrowest of curricula, and. in deplorable conditions. These wore later developed into village or sub-grade schools, and some 239 of these now exist. Elementary schools have also been pushed ahead. There are at present 156 elementary schools for boys and 101 for girls. Intermediate education is catered for by 16 Government schools for boys, at the present time. There are now only 3 Intermediate schools for girls. The amended ton-year plan for education covers the years 1949-1956 and has received the approval of the executive Council. It concerns only education in the Northern provinces: a plan for the Southern provinces will be submitted during 1950. The plan includes provision for: U) Expansion in the training of teachers (ii) Elementary schools. By the end of 1956 there should bo 200 additional schools for boys and 110 additional schools for girls. (iii) intermediate and secondary schools. It is proposed to open 15 more for boys and 8 more for girls by 1956. • (iv) Adult education. (v) Extension of 4 technical training, etc. If the proposals are put into full operation, the recurrent cost of education in the Northern Provinces will rise from £841,320~ 7 - £841,320 in 1949 to £ 1 , 500,000 in 1956 , while capital expenditure during this period will amount to £ 2 , 593 , 110 . (b) Public Health Public Health Services, which were also non-existent at the start of the Administration have been systematically developed# Between the years 1924-1946 the number of in patients in Government hospitals has increased six-fold, the number ,of operations performed seven-fold, and the number of out-patients 1 attendances twenty-fold. In 1947 admissions to hospitals were 137 , 000 , operations 16,700 and attendances of out-patients 9 , 065 , 000 . Major epidemics have been practically eliminated and the general improvement in public health has led to a big increase in population. (c) Labour and factory legislation Labour and factory legislation has recently boon promulgated and an organisation set up for its enforcement under the supervision of an official seconded from the British Ministry of Labour. (a) Cooperatives The initial steps towards the development of co-operative mat hods of -.organisation have ‘been taken; some of the staff required have been appointed and others are being trained. 9» Development Plans (a) Present Programme. A development programme estimated to cost LE 10 millions was started in 1946 to cover the five years 1946-1950. The main items are::- LS Agriculture and Forests (including LE 1,000,000 for the Zandc Scheme.) 1,500,000 Irrigation (principally the extension of the Gezira Scheme by 100,000 acres) * 1,500,000 Posts and Telegraphs Civil Aviation (including LS 88,000 for y inauguration of an Internal Air Service) Urban water -and Electricity Supplies Rural Water Supplies and Soil Conservation Roads and Bridges Education Endowment of Gordon Memorial College 975,000 Buildings 1 9 100 .000 Medical Buildings Buildings other than education and medical. 450.000 125.000 480,000 380,000 390,000 2,075,000 500,000 1 , 200 , 000 . Thisr • - 8 - This programme of LS 10 millions is being financed as to £stg. 2^millions from a special grant-in-aid from the British .Government'and as to the remainder from the Sudan Governments reserves. ^In addition, provision has been made for the capital of LB 3z millions which will be required by the organisation which is being set up to take over the management of the Gezira Scheme in 1950 from the Sudan Plantations Syndicate, Limited, and the Kassala Ootton Company, Limited. (b) Further Development The present 1946-1950 x^rogramme is severely taxing the Sudan Government’s technical resources and it is unlikely to bo completed before mid-1951. Detailed thought has not yet been given to the next programme that is a task which will have to be tackled next year but certain lines of further development stand out very clearly; (i) Further extension of irrigation. It is estimated that at least 2.8 million acres are irrigable by systematic irrigation from the Nile as compared with the present area of about 1.2 million acres. Soil and contour surveys are now being made to determine the total irrigable area more closely but they will take several years to complete. The Sudan is, however, now using, or will shortly be using, the whole of her entitlements under the Nile Waters Agreement and any further expansion is dependent ux^on the Lake Tana and Equatorial Nile Projects. The raising of the level of Sennar reservoir, which is provided for in the technical agreement with Egypt on the Lake Tana project, offers a more immediate prospect of relief; this would givo an additional 150 million m 3 of stored water at relatively small cost if Egypt can be persuaded to agree to it in advance of the construction of the works at Tana. Assuming that the necessary water can be secured and it is ^ally justified, the extension of the irrigated area to 2.8 millions or more acres would take many years to achieve. (ii) Further extension of drinking water supplies by surface storage tsinks and bores to open ux&gt; new areas for cultivation and to permit a greater utilisation of the country f s cattle resources. • (Hi) Development of rainlands. The plains of the Central Sudan, now sparsely populated because of lack of water during the dry season, offer the prospect of a groat increase in .agricultural production if exploited by modern methods. A pilot scheme for mechanical crop production started a few years ago is now getting over its teething troubles and similar schemes elsewhere are now being considered. The emphasis at present is on the production of dura (sorghum) but attention is being givon to other crops. If these plains can be turned into the granary of the Sudan, it may then be possible to eliminate grain from the rotation in the irrigated Gezira Scheme and thus release expensive stored water for more valuable crops. (iv)? . f - 9 - (iv) Furthor expansion of educational .and health services# For the 10-year educati on plan, see fot/vx A si.milar programme for health services is now being drawn Up and it will provide for a considerable increase in hospitals, rural health centres and child welfare and ante-natal clinics# However, with an economy so dependent upon agricultural hazards ,and the price at which cotton can bo sold in the worlds markets, the expansion in social services must be cautious# (v) The lessoning of the country's dependence on cotton by a more varied cropping system is an urgent problem; much research work has been done on this problem but much more remains to bo done before 'the best solution is found, In the meantime the potentialities of Industrial expansion are small. It is not the Government's policy to invest in industry but instead to encourage private enterprise. 10 * Requirements for further development. The three main requirements for further economic and social development on any considerable scale are;— (t) Capital. The Government has net only not resorted to the capital market for nearly a quarter of the century (except for a conversion operation) but has reduced the public debt by LH. 10 millions. With the exception already mentioned - the British Government's grant of £stg. 2 millions it has financed all development expenditure from revenue# When cotton prices fall, rovenuo will not be able to take care of more than minor capital expenditure. Major items must be financed by borrowing. ( it ) An adequate supply of qualified exports. Despite persistent efforts to recruit them, the Sudan Government is still short of various categories, notably, agronomists, entomologists, veterinary research officers# engineers and doctors. quio t so that the people and Administration may concentrate on productive advances and not waste energy and time on profitless political agitation. Continued British guidance will be a sine qua non for some time to come if the progress already made is not to bo jeopardized. (iv) The Sudan Government would welcome a comprehensive exploratory survey such as is described at page 57 of the United Nations document, 'Technical Assistance for Economic Development'. 'The main purpose of such a survey would be to assist the requesting country in analysing its problems and in formulating a development programme that would define the most feasible methods of achieving improved standards and sot out the priorities to bo accorded to different projects. The survey would indicate the ways in- 10 - in which various services available through the United Nations and the specialised agencies could^ be so utilised as to interlock and reinforce one another and provide maximum support for the country’s own efforts at economic development. The international team of experts would work in close co-operation with the Government of the country concerned, and would take account of the existing economic structure, the governmental machinery, the natural, human and financial resources of the country, the social institutions and values of the people, and other local characteristics bearing on economic development,” Such a survey would be of groat value economically and politically to the Sudan Government, The Sudan’s status may well lead to considerable difficulties in securing the services of such a team; but it is hoped they could be overcome# 11« Recommendations as regards Action by His Majesty’s Government, (i) * His Majesty’s Government should agree to guarantee a loan required for further development whon the current 5 -yoar plan is completed. (ii) His Majesty’s Government should assist the Sudan Government to recruit the. technical experts which it requires, (lil) His Majesty’s Government should assist the Sudan 'Government to obtain the services, through the United Nations, of an international team of experts to, advise on development problems and to draw up a • comprehensive programme.AN NE X THE GSZIRA SCHE ME In 1925 the- Sennar Dam and canal system were completed and the first 300,, 000 acres of the Gezira plain put under irrigation. The Scheme* which now covers 900*000 acres of the Gezira plain* is operated on a partnership basis between the State* as represented by the Sudan Government, the people, as represented by the native cultivators and a u specialised management ,i as supplied by the Sudan Plantation Syndicate and the Kassala Cotton Company whose suitability for the task had been established by their successful operation of the earlier pilot-schemes in the Gezira and a large pumping scheme in the Northern Provinceo The basic shares of the three partners in the scheme are: tenant, kOft, Government 40$, and^cotton companies 20$ - a division which follows the local historical custom for bhe sharing of irrigated crops between the cultivators on the one hand and the owners of land and implements on the othere Apart from its immense economic value to the Sudan, the Scheme is of wide interest for its sociological character and achievemento Although not comparable in size with the giant Tennessee Valley Adminis jration* the Scheme has some similarity in principles and has been faced with some greater obstacles in pr^c’.' -'e, epg c * the problems of developing a backward noodle in n ^d of foreign capital but in fear of foreign rumination, of organising agriculture on sound competitive lines where i 4 *- has limped along on a peasant basis for centuries of giving the the strength of a corporate organisation, and the necessity of doing all this in an atmosphere of co-operation strong enough to capture the imagination and support of the people as a whole* The use* but not the ownership* of the land has been nationalised, i.e e * no individual owner can keep his land out of the Scheme or hold the country to ransom on the terms of entry. Thu Government has assumed entire control of and responsibility for the land, paying the owners as compensation a rent equivalent to the highest market rate before the Scheme started and giving them, in addition, original priority option to tunancies* A primary purpose of the Scheme was the production of a cash crop and, after many difficulties which were overcome by the. achievements of the Governments agricultural research institutions* that purpose has been fulfilled. The areas irrigated were devoted mainly to the cultivation of high-grade long-staple cotton. By muan 3 of its direct and indirect revenues*' the Scheme now makes a substantial contribution not only to the general costs of the administration but to the development of the social services of health and education and of new agricultural undertakings in other parts of the Sudanro Apart from the Government’s share, the cash payments to the 20,600 tenants, which now amount to more than a million pounds a year, greatly stimulate the circulation of trade. Apart/Apart from his cash returns, a tenant harvests an average crop of tons of millet per holding which provides more than sufficient to feed his family and labour and a good supply of straw for his animals. He can also: grow a leguminous ^ crop for fattening his animals and a vegetable crop for his own use* Thus the basis of the scheme has been widened from the main pursuit of a cash crop to the building up of a balanced farming society with due attention to animals vegetable and food supplies so that any setback \?hich may affect the export crop may reduce only the cash returns and may leave unimpaired an enhanced standard of nutrition and health. The co-operative advantages which the tenant enjoys are noteworthy. He neud provide no capital at all. He pays no rent for land or water and his crops are free of tax. He get' loans with which to hire any extra labour that is needed. He has the benefit of scientific research to select his seed, choose the best rotation for crops, and protect them from disease. Instruction, supervision tools and materials are all provided. His cotton is transported, ginned and marketed for him. If his yields are bad, artificial manures are supplied to him, not at his own cost but as a charge on all three partners. If his land gets foul, mechanical ploughs clean it, not at his own cost but as a charge against the tenants as a v/hole. Finally a substantial fund has been accumulated to tide him over bad years. But although he has all these benefits of co-operative socialism, a tonantj does not have to pool his profits or his crops with his fellows. His cotton profits are paid to him in accordance with the yield of his individual holding and his grain and other crops belong to him alone. The first stage in the history of the Gezira Scheme will be comxjleted in 1950 v/hen the\Companies 1 concession comes to an end. Their pioneering x j ^rpo se has been fulfilled and the whole asset of the scheme will become the property of the country. The special management will continue in the form of a public utility board which will retain as its executive agents a proportion of the present small supervisory staff until such time as the* can be replaced by Sudanese. The success of the scheme can be judged from the fact that it has conferred immense benefits on the population and has contributed towards giving the Sudan a stable economy; and in addition has enabled the Sudan Plantations Syndicate, who are now due to wind up, to make a substantial return on capital invested.(y% Middle East Official Qommittee Working Party j A meeting will be held on Friday, 25th November, at 3£0 p*m. in Room 25* Agenda To consider a draft paper on the Sudan - ME(0)W,P. 16 - to be circulated.

Their economy is almost exclusively pastoral and tneir way of life tribal and nomadic. Both are racially akin to their neighbours across the frontiers with Eritrea, on the one hand, and British and Italian Somaliland on the other. In the south, i.e. in the areas on both sides of the lakes as far as the northern frontier of Kenya, the population is predominantly Galla. II. ECONOMIC POSITION 1. Agriculture. (l) General Ethiopia, except in the dry and semi-desert areas adjoining Eritrea and Soma!iland, enjoys a rainfall which is suitable fo/ the cultivation of a wide variety of crops. Coffee, cereals, pulses, cotton, tobacco and many oil producing seeds are grown successfully without the aid of modern agricultural methods. This is due, in additon to the rainfall, to the richness of the soil rather than.to good husbandry, for only a few farmers make use of crop rotation or of animal as a fertilizer.(2) Crops* (a) Cereals, comprising wheat, maize, millet, barlet and ueff are the main crops and are grown primarily for internal con*- sumption, their cultivation being limited io the immediate require ments of the peasants* During the lost three years, however, when world prices of grain were high and almost any type of cereal was in demand, farmers increased the cultivation of cereals to take advantage of this valuable export market. For example, from 11th September, 1947» to 9th March, 1948* the value of the export of cereals was Eth $16,032,500.^ This was the most profitable six-month period, and only half this sum was obtained a year later. Now, with the fall in world grain prices, these exports have dropped considerably, and only a small market is found in the neighbouring territories* The inability of Ethiopian cereals to compete in the world market is due to their high price and low quality. The cost of transport- ing^the grain by rail to Jibuti, combined with the refusal of the Ethiopian farmer to accept the lower world prices, accounts for the high price; the low quality is due to the inefficient methods used in cleaning and grading of the grain, which fail to remove many impurities. (A consignment of wheat received in Aden was so dirty as to be unfit for human consumption). (b) Oil seeds. There are twelve varieties of oil seeds, of which the main one is Neuk, containing about 25^0 to 30$ of oil. The other varieties are sunflower, ground nuts, cotton seed, linseed, castor beans, sesame, pumpkin seed, mustard seed, rape seed, saffron and garden cress (an indigenous grass, whose seed contains about 25 % of oil). Although cultivation of these oil seeds is still on a small scale, a steady increase seems to have been made since the war. Using export values again as an index, the sale of oil seeds abroad has risen from Eth. $ 103,560 (September 1945 - March 1946) to Eth. $7,752,540 (September 1948 - March 1949) (c) Coffee. There are two varieties; Harari, which is cultivated, and Abyssinian, which grows wild in the forests round Jimma and Lekemti, Harari coffee, exported under the trade name of ,f longberry mocha”, is used exclusively for blending and fetches a high price in the European market* In March this year it sold at 210 /- per cwt* which was about 20 /- more than the price of the best Kenya coffees* The annual export has risen during the last four years from 12,000 tons to 17,800 tons, about 500 tons being imported each year by the United Kingdom. The Abyssinian variety sells at about 1^/- to 15/- less per cwt, than Harari and is exported mainly to Aden, the Persian Gulf and Egypt. About 4000 tons a year of coffee from the west of Ethiopia finds its way into the Sudan either by river steamer from Gambeilla or as contraband through Kurmuk and Roseires. Much could be done to improve the quality of the coffee for export by the introduction of some system of cleaning and grading* Only occasionally are consignments hand cleaned at Dire Dawa or Jibuti, with the result that Ethiopian coffee, despite its intrinsic high quality, does not fetch the highest possible prices. /(d)...(d) Cotton* A short staple cotton is grown for internal consumption only, and is cultivated in oaiall patches without any system ol' controls; it is in consequence, of bad quality and. /-n riddled with disease. (3) Livestock. (a) Cattle. The number of cattle in the country was estimated in 1944 to be 15*400,000 distributed as follows:— (it is not known how this estimate was made). Milk production is low - the average daily production of a cow being about 1 to 2 litres - with a fat content of about 5%. The cattle are, however, good meat producers, and the nucleus of a blood stock is being built up. A start was made in 1946, when U.N.R.R.A. introduced some cattle for breeding improvement. This was particularly necessary, as the European herds maintained by the Italians had been destroyed during the war. But no improvement of the quality of the Ethiopian cattle will be possible until successful measures have been taken to reduce the very high incidence of rinder pest. Lately a law was passed making the inoculation of cattle compulsory, but it has had little or no practical effect, and, in the sbsence of any means of enforcing this law, the veterinary experts of the F.A.O. will be unable effectively to combat this disease. (4) Livestock Products. The export of hides, sheepskins and goatskins has increased since the war, and during the 1 st two quarters these products amounted to 25% in value of the total export trade. There is also a small, but regular, export trade in beeswax each year (Eth.$ 260,600 from March 10th to June 7th this year), which at the present time mainly finds its way to the United States. 2 Commerce - General . The Ethiopian Government are, in theory at any rate, anxious to modernise the country (though in practice they are often content to achieve merely the most superficial appearance of modernisation)* and, in the absence of native talent and experience, this process ’ demands the presence of European technicians and advisers in every field of development. In Addis Ababa, but not elsewhere, the attempt is being made to achieve a ’ , western ,, standard of living. This, in view of the pastoral and non-industrial nature of the country, depends on_the importation of nearly all consumer goods. Furthermore, these imports are not as might be expected in a primitive and undeveloped country, restricted to so-called necessities, but include — perhaps, indeed, to cater for the more sophisticated needs of the European community — a wide range of the more expensive luxuries. The need, therefore, for the import agent is considerable, and a relatively large European and Eastern Mediterranean merchant class has established itself. Trade, however, is hampered to a great extent by bad communi cations. Even were the necessary capital and enterprise available the mountainous nature of the country and the rains would hamper 9 Oxen Bulls Cows 4.500.000 5 . 200.000 5,500,000 200,000 Calves /the..*the maintenance of good roads and railways. The main commercial route is the railway from Jibuti to Addis Ababa. This is a Franco- Ethiopian concern controlled from Paris, and freight rates are, by economic standards, unnecessarily high. These high costs are, for most imported goods, further increased by an arbitrary system of assessing customs duties, which are based, not on a fixed tariff. 'f ree ' market values. It is not, therefor!, surprising that, allowing even a reasonable margin of profits to ■D h ^+? erchant&gt; ?2? d !L pre P riced ^ of proportion to their value* Furthermore, with the end of the post-war period, Ethiopia, is. in common with most countries, changing over from a sellers r to a i , and d ? manci &gt; least for consumer goods, has to a i'??® a f, tent satisfied. Marchants are now having difficulty m disposing of their stocks. ^ ia sta _ ted elsewhere, the export trade depends almost entirely on agricultural and animal products. These, unfortunately, do not enable the country to achieve a balance of trade. At present i?fh a Son a nr,n d ^A Se of trade is in the neighbourhood of hQS been largely, if not completely, met in the past by the sale of gold, most of which is disposed of at free market rates by the Emperor in his personal capacity. Indica tions are that the sale of gold is no longer sufficient to bridge the gap between exports and imports and it is believed that a measure of curroncy control will shortly be introduced in order to remedy the acute shortage of hard currency. It is doubtful whether the measure will be successful since there appear to be ^ or eva sion. If it were successful, one of Its effects would probably be to depress the export trade still further since, owing to the decline of the world price level for agricultural produce and to the generally inferior quality of Ethiopian products, exporters have relied for their profits not on the sale of the produce itself abroad but on the sale in the free market in Addis Ababa of the hard currency earned by the produce. Deprived of this source of profit, the exporter will have either to +v^ S ?-i hi + p :Tj ce a ^f oad or force down the price paid to the producer: f J I&gt;s ‘ fc j ad J erna ' fc:LV Q will naturally mean that less can be sold abroad and the second that less will be available for sale, 3# Industry and Mining * (l) Industry -iYn Ve mu feW industriGS aa d these are mostly concentrated in Addis ^baba. They are run on simple lines and need little in the way of expensive capital equipment* The following list is comprehensive:- 1) Small scale canning of tomatoes and tomatoe juice at Adana in central Ethiopia. 2 ) Cotton factory at Dire Dawa, 3) Fibre factory for making garry-bags and ropes in Addis Ababa. 4) Bottle and glass factory, using broken glass as the raw material, in Addis Ababa*5) Three tanneries in Addis Ababa* 6 ) Shoe factory in Addis Ababa, using locally tanned leather. 7) Cement factory at Dire Bawa. 8 ) Several flour mills throughout the country 9 ) Vegetable oil mills in Addis Ababa. 10) Biscuit and macaroni factory in Addis Ababa. 11) Soap factories in Addis Ababa and one at Neghelli in south Ethiopia. There are no plans for the development of any of these industries with the exception of a project to build a modern vegetable oil mill at Gondar. Y/ith the exception of the glass factory and a few flour and oil mills and a tannery all these enterprises utilised the plant and building originally installed by the Italians during their occupation. (2) Mining. Gold and platinum are extracted from alluvial deposits. The main gold working is at Adola; reliable figures for the annual production are not available, but it is believed that about 60,000 of gold produced a year. Some gold is believed to be extracted from a reef by primitive methods in the Adola-Dilla-Uondo area. The platinum working at Yubdo in western Ethiopia is devoted mainly to the export trade. The quantities produced are small and yield little return (only 111.780 Ethiopian dollars forvthe sale of platinum so far this year). This was originally a Franco-Italian concern which had been operating for many years before the war. ( 3 ) Petroleum* In 1943 the Sinclair Oil Corporation was granted a concession for the exploration for, and the exploitation of, oil in Ethiopia. Their activities have been confined to the Ogaden and have so far not resulted in the discovery of oil. U Communications. The problem of providing satisfactory communications both internally.••internally and with the outside world is one of the most difficult which faces Ethiopia; and the present had state of communications accounts to a large extent for the depressed state of the country*s economy owing to the high element of freight charges in the price of Ethiopian exports* The only railway in Ethiopia is the Franco- Ethiopian railway which runs from Addis Ababa to Jibuti, the normal port of shipment for Ethiopian exports* The exorbitant charges levied by the railway on passenger and freight traffic (as well as the difficulties which have arisen as a result of the present stoppage of the railway service following the recent riots at Dire Dawa) have led the Ethiopian Government seriously to examine the possibilities of alternative means of communication, notably the development of road traffic to Assab. A certain amount of Ethiopian produce has for some time been carried by road to Massawa more cheaply than by rail to Jibuti, and it can be envisaged that from now on Jibuti will be able to exercise less of a stranglehold on Ethiopian foreign trade than it has in the past. The road system which was much improved during the Italian occupation has been allowed to deteriorate and the present state of the roads is for the most part lamentable. This applies particularly in the couth and west of the country, and there are many areas of Ethiopia which are completely inaccessible by any modern means of transport. Since 1945» however, there has been considerable development of air transport, both internal and exterucilA Ethiopian Air Lines, established in 1946, operates under a managerial contract with T.W.A. and, in addition to a number of internal services, maintains services to Cairo (via Asmara) and Karachi and Bombay (via Aden) # The managerial and operating staff is predominantly American and the airline has earned a substantial profit on its operations, proving a serious competitor in ths Red Sea with B.O.A.C. /III,.*•HI. SOCIAL POSITION. .... i j 1 14.' 1 !iiii»wy -' r,-.;,? 1 o LaLour In 1919 Ethiopian application for merribership of the League of Nations was rejected on the grounds of her inability to carry out the obligations of a member state, especially with regard to slavery. In 1923 , however, a proclamation was issued condemning dealers in the slave trade, and Ethiopia, largely as a result of French pressure and lobbying, was permitted to join the League* But, in spite of the proclamation, the system of slavery was widely practised, being almost an essential part of the country s economy; many subsequent proclamations and much effort were required before the general abolition of slavery became a reality* It is not surprising, therefore, that labour conditions are still primitive and that workers’ rights as understood in western Europe, are unknown* The Italian occupation did much to encourage the proletariat”, The abolition of the feudal system of labour (see section on Land Tenure) and the substitution of wage labour emancipated the peasant; he now expects payment lor his labour or for his agricultural produce* In this connexion it was interesting to see that merchants being unable this year to offer the former high prices for cereals, were unable to persuade the farmers to sell, and as explained earlier, this was a contributory cause of the considerable decrease in the export of cereals* This particular operation of the price mechanism may not be an unusual occurrence in more civilised countries but it emphasises strongly in Ethiopia the emergence of a class of producers able to influence the economy of the country* The above^example illustrates only the attitude of mind of what might be defined as the small capitalist class. Little is known about the conditions of work of the employed wage earners. The working class, owing to the Very small industrial development, is as yet unorganised* Some attempt has been made to build up a workers* organisation amongst the railway employees who, in defiance of the law forbidding trades unions, have organised an unofficial union* I ■ if . % 2 * Land Tenure The system of land tenure in Ethiopia is complicated and obscure. What follows is based on chapters 16 and 21 of 'The Government of Sthiopia” by Margery Perham who has studied the question more carefully than anyone else in the light of such evidence as is available. It is probably true to say that while in the old northern provinces which originally constituted the Empire there is something approaching a system in process of evolution, even this much cannot be said of the territories conquered by Menelik II* These are for the most part, if not wholly, regarded as Grown land, and some of them have been used for the settlement of ex-soldiers or granted to Amhara officials* /UntilUntil the Italian conquest the system of land tenure in the northern provinces was in some respects similar to that of early mediaeval Englando It was a system of tributes and tithes and services ? which the gabar, or :; free cultivator” rendered to an overlord in exchange for the use of land. It was for a long time a matter of controversy, however, whether private property existed at alio It was contended by the Emperors that all allegedly private lands were held only by the grace of the Emperor or because, he had granted away his rights to some or all of the various iithes and services and that ultimate ownership was held to reside in the Emperor, This theory was to some extent refuted by the fact that some land was generally recognised as being subject to hereditary ownership. But private ownership in the sense that the worker of the soil was himself the owner and therefore free of tithes and services, was rare, for the economy of the country depended on the fruits of the gabar 1 s labour. In modern times* however, private ownership of land has become more general, and in the Constitution of 193‘l a private owner was, '’except in cases of public utility determined by law”, safeguarded against being deprived of ’’movable or landed property”, A Lands Department is maintained under the direction of the Ministry of the Interior and owners are encouraged to register their lando When ownership is proved, title deeds are given. A start has been made in surveying land in this connexion, but it is not thought that this work has progressed beyond the immediate vicinity of the principal towns. Proof of ownership is required in the form of title deeds by the Agricultural Bank in applications for mortgages. The Church owns large tracts the proceeds of which were until recently used to main tab... iLo clergy. In recent years an attempt has been made to put the maintenance of clergy on a more modern footing by the introduction of state supervision of both church lands and ecclesiastical administration. Under the Italian occupation the gabars assumed the status of ordinary peasants and worked for wages 0 Finding this a freer and more convenient way of life than the complexities of the former feudal system* many .gabars have been disinclined to welcome back the landlords on the old basis. To devise a new system of land tenure is, therefore, one of the problems facing the Government, and the main need seems to be security of tenure and a fixed rent for the tenant cultivators. As far as is known, there is no restriction on the sale of land between one private owner and another, except as regards foreigners. The position regarding ownership of land by foreigners is obscure,. It seems, however, that no land owned by an Ethiopian can be sold to a foreigner without the Emperors consent, but land already held by a foreigner can be freely disposed of to another foreigner, 3* Public Health As was stated in the section on Population, no medical services exist in some parts of the country and in most others they are inadequate^ A list was recently compiled by the representative of the World Health Organisation of all the hospitals and dispensaries in the country. Although it appears that there are hospitals and dispensaries in every province, vast areas are in fact without any medical facilities and many of the /dispensariesdispensaries consist of no more than a hut, sometimes without drugs, attended by a badly trained dresser, Furthermore, the alleged maximum number of beds in each hospital is woefully inadequate, and there is seldom sufficient equipment to maintain even half this number 0 With these limitations it is not surpris ing that the ordinary citizen has little chance of being admitted to a hospital. But ? even should accommodation be available, the poor, particularly in Addis Ababa are debarred from all the State- run hospitals by their inability to pay the official fees, and well over 95% of the Ethiopian population are desperately poor# The hospitals ? with very few exceptions, are State-run and all of them are staffed by foreign doctors, there being no qualified Ethiopian doctors, midwives or nurses. There are no qualified health inspectors- 4• Edu catio n It would be impossible, and anyway unnecessary to attempt an estimate of literacy for the whole country, EducaHon, on the most generous interpretation of the term , was started in Ethiopia only about forty years ago. Relatively good progress was made from 1925 ^9350 The Italians, while doing little to educate the Ethiopian population, constructed numbers of schools to serve the requirements of the Europeans and these buildings have proved extremely useful to the Ethiopians in all the large towns# Furthermore, with a widely scattered and agricultural population, the physical difficulties of introducing an educational system are considerable c At the same time, there is little popular desire to achieve literacy, an ability to read and write being quite unnecessary to the daily life of the peasant farmer# Church schools have, indeed, functioned throughout the country from time immemorial, but at the best they do no more than inculcate the dcvma and a few chants of what is in fact an extremely dim and obsrvrantist form of the Christian religion# All schools, except those of a few Missionary Societies and the General Wingate School in Addis Ababa, are run by the Government and education is free. They are mostly elementary# Already there are sufficient of them in the capital and the large provincial towns, and their numbers are increasing in the province So Some, staffed by Europeans and Indians, give a good education, principally the Tafari Makonnen School and the Medhane Alem School in Addis Ababa, two at Harar, Two at Bessie and one at Asba Tafario But many of the local schools in the country districts, depending on young Ethiopian teachers, may even fail to teach the puxuls how to read and write. There are two secondary schools in Addis Ababa, the General Wingate School and the Haile Selassie School, both of which were founded by the British Council (the latter now being run by Swedish teachers)# Their standard of education is good, and both far had promising results in the London Matriculation examination# Secondary educational sections are being developed at some of the elementary schools in Addis Ababa and Harar, In the capital there are also some technical schools a fairly good Commercial School, a Theological School, and a Teachers * Training School which has gone to the bad since the British Council, v/ere obliged by a series of intrigues to abandon their interest in it# Since^ the war there has been an increasing demand from pupils to oe educated, or to complete their education, abroad, chiefly in the United Kingdom# At the present time there are 66 pupils in the United Kingdom, from the ages of 7 to 26# Others have been sent to the U-SnA,, Switzerland and Beirut# The /educationeducation of nearly all the pupils abroad is paid for by the Government* The weakness of the Government's educational system may be * attributed to three main factors* First, there is a marked absence of intelligent direction in the Ministry of Education, despite the well-informed and constructive criticism offered by the Canadian Deputy- Director-General* Secondly, too much attention is paid to education in Addis Ababa, at the expense of'the provinces, and lastly, the standard of teaching is low* To these factors most foreign observers would probably be inclined to^add that the intellectual soil' is intrinsically infertile* British teachers in Ethiopia do indeed report a great desire to learn amongst their (mostly elementary) pupils; but this can be accounted for, without undue cynicism, by the fact that a knowledge of lf the three R’s' is still a passport to government employ - so great is the percentage of illiteracy - and that an office job ? however poorly paid, is considered preferable to the grinding poverty of the peasant’s lot* It is, however, significant that 3 with the exception of two or three novels written by a former Ethiopian Minister of Foreign Affairs and long since unobtainable, there are not even the beginnings of a contemporary Amharic literature, nor are any foreign books translated into^Amharic„ The demand for books of any kind, by those Ethiopians who can read their own language but no other, appears to oe absolutely nil* One of the most depressing characteristics of the Amhara, and one of the most fundamental, is his complete lack of intellectual interests. JV• PLANS AND PRO SPECTS FOP. ECO NOMIC AND SOCIAL PROGRESS 1• Agri c ulture In a recent report on agriculture in Ethiopia the representa tive of the F&lt;A:&gt;Oc expressed the belief that the existing methods of crop cultivation were justifiable. The long-established principle of 'contour ploughing' in the hill regions preserves the land to some extent from the ill effects of soil erosion. The main requirement in cultivating the rich, heavy loam, which is the common soil in the hills, is to conserve moisture* Any modern technique, therefore, such as deep ploughing and disc harrowing, which would lay the soil open to erosion, should be avoided* 9 The development of crops should come through better seed selection, the use of animal manure as a fertilizer, and a more general system ol crop rotation. After harvest, the produce, especially coffee, should be more carefully cleaned and graded, and pulping, iermenting and curing, as carried out in other coffee growing countries should ba resorted to* It is thought that the production of coifee, the major export* could be considerably increased and, in view of the world demand for vegetable oils* the opportunity should be taken to increase the production of oilseeds* ^ Two members of the FoA.O* are attached to the Ministry of Agriculture, one advising on crop cultivation and the other on livestock* lo is hoped that by the end of the year this advisory staff will be .increased to six. This should lead to better supervision at the top and more frequent inspections of native holdings*_ But the main need now is for at least one agricultural college and one experimental station under Euronean The . th: ^ e existing farming schools are small, badly at presence undertaken? n ° 8atl8factc **y training program* can /2 0 Public Health2 .

The employment of foreign doctors (mainly British and Swedish) involves the Ethiopian Government in considerable expense and it is mainly the financial factor which has prompted the Ethiopian Government to accept a recent offer by the World Health Organisation to assist them in financing a scheme for the training of Ethiopian medical students in Uganda* Under this scheme a limited number of fellowships will be granted to Ethiopian students, and it is hoped that it will be put into operation next January as a result of a preliminary visit to Kampala by three Ethiopian officials, including the Vice-Minister of Education, to be made this month* 3* Educa tion The main obstacle in the way of better education is the shortage of good teacherso At present the number of good schools, which is extremely small, is limited by the number of Europeans,. This situation will never be remedied as long as there is only one inefficient teachers* training school.. The Government’s decision, after the war, to enable students to receive secondary and university education in the United Kingdom and the United States shewed at least the imp-ojHranoe they attach to better education. But this expensive programme of foreign courses, which can be made available only to a small fraction of the country''s you-tn,-will-not benefit Ethiopia unless some of the returning graduates are willing to play their part in teaching or training their home-educated and less fortunate fellow students. The first batch of students educated abroad will soon be returninge . is difficult to guess what their intentions will be* It is hoped that the more conscientious will endeavour to assist in some way the development of the country, but some may well prove to be more of a nuisance than an advantage* The rise, in this backward country* of a discontented ’’intelligentsia ’ 1 is a danger which the Government should not underrate^ That this danger is a real one is already becoming evident* The effect of education on the average Ethiopian is to unfit him for manual labour of any kind. The secondary schools in Ethiopia itself are expected to produce some 800 ’’educated” youths in the next five years; and the number of additional clerical and other posts available within that period is not expected to exceed 250* There will thus be created a substantial nucleus of unemployed ’’intellectual” malcontents which will present a serious problem to the Ethiopian Government. 1• Ext ernal Financial Assistance Pour loans, two from the U.,S,A. and two from- Sweden, have been granted to Ethiopia since the war. The first U.S. loan in 1945 was of 5 , 425*000 fine- bun 00 '- 0 silver for the purpose of minting currency* It is free of interest and repayable in kind or in the equivalent amount*of U*Sr dollars at the time of re payment. The second U.S*- loan 01 three million dollars, was granted by the Export-Import Bank in 1946 for the purchase by Ethiopia of capital equipment in the UeS.A. So far the Ethiopian Government have availed themselves of only one sixth of this / amountL2 M •' amount, being reluctant to and^being chary of capital administer and finance the The two Swedish loans were and are being used partly various Swedish technician the Government will be abl drawing on the currency re buy at the high prices now prevailing investment owing to their inability to industries which might be developed* for Kr, 5 million and Kr. 2£ million, to pay the salaries and expenses of the s and advisers. It is unlikely that e to repay any of these loans without serve. ~ „ There is little external financial assistance in the form of foreign investments, as the Government are unwilling to attract foreign capital owing to their traditional distrust of and their &amp; QsiliQ to keep for themselves the mineral ? t i Le ^.^? so y rce ^ e However, when the Lake Tsana project is started Ethiopia should benefit considerably. She will also f n^? n n lally i 11 the event ( at unlikely) of the Sinclair Oil Corporation discovering oil in the Ogaden. Ext ernal Materin 1 Assistance For many years to come Ethiopia will depend on foreign supplies of materials and equipment. This will be true for development m every field. Even progress in agriculture, which is the country s greatest natural asset, will depend on foreign material for the foundation and development of experimental stations and training colleges, besides any modern faming equipment which may be desirable. Ethiopia cannot, however. ye iU aS a promisin g market for capital goods, as she is unable to afford any large scale development* # w + hi T ? e La ^ e Project, if it materialises, will provide Ethiopia with hydroelectric power, which will not, however, reach the main centres at Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa but will be available only to the areas near to the Lake where hydro-electric power can at present be put to very little use* 3• Exte rnal JTechnica 1 Assistance Nearly every Government department has the assistance of +h^ P q+ n + 0r u^ m f ri S a 24.u? vi ? ere ThG Gover nor and Vice-Governor Ethiopia are both Americans, and the fmn^? in A te ? taff of the .

The President, Mr.. Abbott, has ho ro UGn ^ lsra:Lsse H I ' rom his posto The grounds for his dismissal c.ve not been vouchsafed by the Ethiopian Government and it can / onlyonly be assumed that they are too discreditable to be revealed# The administration of justice in Ethiopia is far from satisfactory x snd it is known that Mr* Abbott in his energetic endeavours to instil, into his Ethiopian colleagues in the High Court the elementary principles of justice, has fallen foul of the present ruling clique, including the Emperor himself# It has become clear that the Ethiopian Government intend that ‘'justice * 1 shall be administered in their particular interests* and, while wishing to preserve a facade of modern judicial procedure (and also, of course, to be able to fulfil their obligations under the Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement of 1944) by having in the High Court judges of 'proven judicial experience in other lands', they evid ently prefer the subservient type who is prepared to.carry out their wishes without question. Mr. Abbott’s position has, in any case, been growing more and more difficult for seme time and his dismissal has now provoked Mr# Addis, the second British judge, into sending in his resignation# The third European judge, a Swede, whose contract expires in the near future, had already been informed that it would not be renewed# The only remaining non-Ethiopian judge is a Palestinian of doubtful principles* The usefulness of foreign advisers and technicians generally is limited in any case by the variety of countries from which they are selected and, with a few exceptions, by their poor quality* The few who have the necessary qualifications for their jobs and who are prepared to face criticism in their efforts to get their advice accepted and acted upon, inevitably find it an uphill struggle; and it can be said that the number of such advisers is growing notably smaller. There is a marked tendency on the part of the Ethiopian Government at the present time to select as advisers displaced persons who demand smaller salaries and who are prepared to accept less advantageous conditions than those who can command alternative employment in their own countries# This x^olicy, besides being cheaper, has the advantage, from the Ethiopian Government's point of view, of bringing into their service advisers and technicians who will be more amenable to pressure because they have more to lose If they do not do what they are told, while at the same time providing Ethiopia with a facade of modern statehood with which to confront the world, VI.RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACTION BY HIS MAJ ESTY'S GOVERNMENT The possibilities for the economic development of Ethiopia are, in theory, considerable; but in practice they are limited by the primitive political organisation of the country and by the corruption, ignorance and arrogance of the ruling clique# Capital investment in Ethiopia by Plis Majesty’s Government is definitely not recommended in view of the ineradicable hostility of the powers that be towards foreign interests and of the unacceptable conditions w;'th which the exploitation of the country's resources by foreign interests would be hedged around# The provision of further British advisers and technicians is also not recommended °ince, as has been explained above, their sole use, as far as Ethiopian Government are concerned, would be to provide a iucade behind whith Ethiopian . administrative corruption and inefficiency would continue unabated. On the contrary; it is recommended that,, as far as possible, His Majesty s Government should discourage British subjects from seeking employment under the Ethiopian Government# /TheThu only field in wnich this recommendation does not apply is that of edacation 0 It is considered that, while the present ruling clique is 'beyond hope of salvation, there is some chance that the younger generation of Ethiopians, if trained in the right way, may eventually succeed in introducing more enlightened^methods and a higher standard of morality into the administration. It is therefore recommended that the work of the British Council!, 'be given increased support and that any requests which the Ethiopian Government may make for the pro/ision ol British teachers 'be given as sympathetic consideration as possihloo^4 (THIS DOCUMiiNT IS THE PROPERTY GOVERNMENT) i l? rrr r? • OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJES OONFIDBNTIAL 13 COPY NO... 26 th October. 1949 .

Waterlow Secretary CABINET OFFICE, S.W.1 26 th October, 1949.The Lebanon Economic and Social Development Part 1 . Introduction. Though the smallest, both from the point of view of population and of area, of all the Member States of the Arab League, the Lebanon is in many respects the most remarkable. I + ^ 1:LI ? at 2 undoubtedly the best in the Middle East. The no^ n(iar +• ^ ilG Sweater part of the population is o iparativoly high Public health is by Middle Sast standards good. education facilities are considerable and illiteracy is in many parts of the country virtually unknown. Individual in in + 1 vo . on ’k'3rp*’isG exist in a high degree and are reilooted in the largo number of Lebanese emigrants to be found m all parts of the world. It is in effect estimated that there are as many Lebanese living abroad as there are in the Lebanon. The merchants of Beirut are well known for their commercial skill ? n ^ a * 5 °fi GnCG * In the diversity of sects (roughly haif of the population is Christian and half Moslem) the various elements live together in relative harmony. In general the Lebanese are the least xenophobic in the Middle 3ast and it is not without justification that the Lebanonhas been described as ^ na ^ U K al between the 3ast and the West. Economically the Lebanon is very much an enigma* The possibilities of development are considerable though country ’q °irii'n ^vof^ 0 P oasiblu . 111 Sgypt, Iraq and Syria. Tho ^ 3 mair ? Physical resource is water and its use both for r v-^ii?f+ 1 ^ n 4 . ari +v, th0 d ? volo P mon t of hydro-electric power should be exploited to the maximum. In the interests of&gt;stability, a^o 1 i U ?‘ arly as th ? dos tructive forces of Communism are not without appeal m some sorni-oducation quarters in the Lebanon, opportunities of economic and social development should not be i^ssed. 2* Political v&gt; ThG hobsmon (jind Syria) achieved complete independence a £ tor p Sora ? ^ WGn ^ y “* fiv G yoars under French mandatory rule in 19L6 itar ? forcos wara evacuatod, Tho proucrl rl^mo may described as Arab Nationalist and in general derives its section h of r th^ t nh Q l° ln ?hts in the population and from a S h h 3tl ?? S (®- ranl J r thoso who sympathisa with tha ^als of Arab Nationalism). Christian influence however to some extent serves to moderate Arab Nationalism and in general extremism is absent. b x ‘ rUL As might be expected the Arab Nationalists in tho Lebanon are closely associated „ith Nationalists in Syria and as a result the Lebanon has in tho past tended to fall in with Syria’s p ^ 1 i? al ?*i gnr ? on ? with s ^ ud i Arabia and Egypt. Following the Palestine debacle however this tondonc.y has become less marked and more emphasis is now laid on Lebanese neutrality in inter-Arab rivalries. This has boon accompanied by an improvement m relations with tho Hashemite States. ThoThe present Christ!an-Moslam population ratio (the ‘ dominant factor in Lobanoso politics) rosulted from tho inclusion in the Greater Lebanon of the largely Moslem areas of tho Boqaa, Tripoli^ and Akkar, Maintenance of this arrangement (effected in 1920) is a basic factor in the understanding between the Lebanese and Syrian Nationalists - the so-called compromise of 19^3* Tho areas concerned are however culturally and economically backward as compared with other areas in tho Lebanon and have not yet been fully assimilated. The Moslem hinterlrand exerts a considerable power of attraction which would probably be increased if Syria became part of a larger political entity under Hashemite control. Hence Lebanese concern at tho possibility of greater unity in the Fertile Orescent area* The present regime is well-disposed towards His Majesty’s Government not only as a result of the assistance given by His Majesty’s Government to the cause of Lebanese independence but also because of His Majesty’s Government’s known sympathy for Arab Nationalism which is contrasted with alleged French Colonialism* This attitude has been consistently maintained in spite of very considerable French economic and cultural influence* French influence derives from the French controlled Bank of Issue, French concessionary companies (railways, port of Beirut, etc,,) the recent Franco- Lebanese monetary agreement, the French university and schools, and finally from the tradition of friendship between Christian elements in the Lebanon and Franco. Tho administration is in general of a low standard, tho Civil Service is badly paid and with few notable exceptions is ineffective and dishonest. Political intorferonco in the administration is unfortunately rarapant*. 3• General aconomic Position . During the mandatory period the Lebanon and Syria formed an economic union. Their economies wore in general complementary - the Lebanon being a country of services and Syria a producing country. When independence was in the process of being achieved the economic unity was virtually broken, though by a Convention signed in October, 1943# the Customs Union was maintained. The free circulation of goods between tho two countries, though provided for in the agreement, in practice became restricted and separate import and export policies wore followed. Tho growth of industrialisation in both countries tended to strengthen the separatist tendencies. At the same time the Syrian Government encouraged Syrian merchants to import the country’s requirements direct and not as in the past through Lebanese commercial houses* Tho quota system applied to the distribution of import business between Lebanese and Syrian merchants and (particularly after 1946 when the purchase of sterling was restricted) to the allocation of hard currcncioG f was based on the population ratio of tho two countries. These arrangements improved tho position of Syrian merchants who were oven able to some extent to inverse the normal roles of the two countries and to sell imported goods in the Lebanon* Tho Syrian Government also sought to increase tariffs both as a moans of limiting imports and of encouraging their nascent industries.This resulted in the strengthening of the movements in the Lebanon in favour of the dissolution of the Customs Union and the reorganisation of Lebanese commerce on the basis of free trade* The very high cost of Syrian wheat was also put forward as a reason for a change - in 1947-48 partly as a result of a poor Syrian harvest and x^ertly owing to attempts by the Syrian Government to sell their crop for foreign currency - the Lebanon was obliged to use its foreign exchange to buy Australian, Canadian and American flour. It is realised however that the Syrian hinterland is the Lebanese merchant’s best market and that this must be maintained and if possible expanded* There are also political objection from the point of view of both the Lebanese and the Syrian Governments to any loosening of the ties binding the two countries. It is also realised that in abnormal times the Lebanon (which in the 1914-18 war had literally starved) is a dependant on Syria for its essential food requirements, particularly cereals. After protracted negotiations agreement was reached in July, 1949, whereby Syria undertook to supply the Lebanese needs in cereals and a compromise on tariff policy was reachod. ( 2 ) Commercial Policy Under the Mandate the Levant States were only permitted to conclude commercial treaties with neighbour countries and non-member states of the League of Nations, Imports from the latter wore subject to the maximum tariff (usually 50 ^), whereas member states enjoyed, without any obligation as regards reciprocity, the normal tariff (usually 25 #)* Of the arrangements concluded with neighbouring states the most important were those with Palestine and Transjordan which in general provided for tho free exchange of agricultural products and (until 1939 when certain restrictions were imposed) of locally manufactured articles. An agreement with Iraq fixed transit duos at 1£. In common with other Arab League States tho Lebanese imposed a boycott on Zionist goods in 1946, In 1948 tho conclusion of coromereial treaties with Italy and tho Yemen and the commercial provisions of tho financial agreement with Franco marked a now departure which is in accordance with tho new sovereign status of the Lebanon. (3) Monetary Position . Tho joint Lobaneso-Syrian currency, issued by tho Banquo du Syrio ot du Liban in virtue of a convention signed in 1924 and renewed in 1937, is entirely covered by French francs, French Government securities and (to a very limited extent) by gold. Following the expulsion of Vichy forces in 1941 tho Lebanon and Syria entered into special relations with the sterling area. Sterling necessary for essential requirements was provided. From May, 1943 the purchase of sterling was. free and many Lebanese acquired large holdings'. Restrictions on the purchase of sterling were reimposed in March, 1946 and essential requirements wore made available by tho French Treasury. AsVV) Kr) As a result of the Anglo-Frerich-Lebaiiese—Syriati inancial^agreement of 1944 which fixed the Lebanese—Syrian pound at d.oh to .£ 1 , the French authorities undertook to revalue, in the event of a devaluation of the franc in terms of sterling, the Lebanese and Syrian franc holdings, when devaluation took place in December, 1945 this engagement was honoured by the payment by the French Treasury of 16.6 milliard francs. A year later however the French Government indicated that in the event of a further evaluation of the franc they would not be prepared to make good the depreciation of Lebanese and Syrian holdings. Appeals by the Lebanese and Syrian Governments to His Majesty s Government and to the United States Government produced no results and negotiations were opened with France The French Government after protracted talks agreed to revalue (following the revaluation of the franc in January, 194 o;, and to guarantee against further devaluation some milliard out of the total of approximately 23 milliard francs held by Lebanon and Syria after deducting ° f CGrta J: n ^ r 'unch properties in the Lebanon and Syria taken over by the local Governments; to release these holdings at a rate not exceeding one tenth per year during the five year period beginning January, 1953, and at the end of that period to make available the balance any currency desired by the Governments (or if exchange restrictions existed at the time), half in French francs and half in European currencies. They however agreed to release the balance of the 23 milliard francs partly in r,J^T riC£ v f0r the purchase of French goods and partly (but not exceeding one half) in Furopoan currencies, i.e. not including dollars. ’ ^ The Lebanese Government signed an agreement on this basis in January, 1948. The Syrian Government declined and it was not until the summer of 1949 that a Franco-Syrian agreement was concluded. Though the signatures of the Franco-Lebaneso agreement was the subject of groat controversy in the Lebanon there is little doubt that the disadvantages of the agreement are more than outweighed by its advantages. Monetary stability (except in the event of a devaluation of sterling) is guaranteed for ten years. it should bo observed however that, before the end )f that period when the franc cover may bo only half of the valu. Lebanese and Syrian pounds in circulation, the currency will probably need to bo reorganised* It is generally recognised in the Lebanon that it should be brought more into lino with the currencies of neighbouring countries than based on sterling. Syria and the Lebanon did not devalue their currencies following the devaluation of the pound sterling in September, .1949. The note circulation of the Lebanon and Syria which in ‘^59 amounted to some £SL 40M increased in 1945 os a result pf allied military expenditure to about £LS 400M. It fell in 1947 to £LS 346M and the bank of issue by restricting credit is now following a policy of disinflation. The value of bank notes in circulation in the Lebanon fell iri May to £L164 in August. In 1947, pounls Lob ^se, (i.o. issued in Beirut), and W,000,000 were pounds Syrian (issued in Damascus). This division is however arbitrary - in February, 1948 it in of waswas found that soma 60^000,000 Syrian pounds ware in'the Lebanon, Gold is still used to a great extant as a madium or transaction in Syria. It is noteworthy that the Ottoman Bank has an important interest (it holds 11,000 out of the total of 51,000 shares) in the Banque do Syrie et du Liban and that British financial interests are thus involved in the bank of issue. A British official v/as appointed to the staff of the Bank s Head Office in Beirut some three years ago but he has not been permitted to influence to any groat extent the policy of the bank which is firmly in the hands of French officials. (4) Balance of Trade. Owing to the Customs Union with Syria and the maintenance of joint statistics it is extremely difficult to consider the trade of the Lebanon separately from that of Syria. Liuvui'se oaianc economy of the Customs Union even before the war but the by invisible exports (expenditure y the French military authorities, emigrants remittances, tourist trade, commercial and other services). During the war expenditure by the allied armies combined with obstacles to trade resulted in the accumulation oi very considerable balances of foreign exchange* Since the war the adverse balances of trade became incroasGd from *bout £L 90M in 1945, to LL 1 obM in 1946. The volume of exports particularly to Palestine and France fell and imports reached the pre-war level. In view of the depletion of stocks as a result of the war, the latter is not surprising or even excessive, ihc value of imports was nearly four times that of pre war years but this is due not only to increased prices but hi S£ Proportion of luxury goods and gold coin and bullion. It is estimated that as much as 60 /i of the gold so imported is re-exported clandestinely. The reserve accumulated during the war was thus considerably a ^ alarico P^bably still remains end the gold holdings in the country which have probably been increased represent a reserve of purchasing power. h &gt; on S iP the capital reserves wore not to St ° a th0 cJUntr y left without the means to purchase essential requirements imports might have to be on S ^nio t 0 d I- , Va:Lua b lQ assets had indeed been frittered away i^ssent!als• Expenditure by the military authorities which in pre-war years had served to bridge the gap ceased noh f ovoa inlopondonoo altSmativo f ^ ihcome remained to bo proved. There wore ^I 0 p + V nany y bstaC B s ln tho wn:&gt; ' of official control and limitation of imports. As the Lebanon is a country of services (commercial, tourist, educational, etc.,) a policy oasy tj justify and there exist the practical difficulties inherent in an inefficient administration. Present indications are that as a result ofof the change from ca buyers to a sellers market and over stocking by merchants imports are being automatically reduced. In the meantime the Government has made a beginning with the to some extent alternative policy of encouraging exports, e.g # the commercial agreements with Italy, Prance, and the Yemen. The decision in September, 1949 not to devalue the Lebanese and Syrian currencies is however bound to increase the difficulties facing Lebanese exporters# The establishment of an important money market in Beirut has also been encouraged by the legalisation in the Autumn of 1948 of the-free market in foreign exchange. This latter development was considered undesirable from the point of view of British exchange control as it resulted in an irregular dollar sterling cross rate but there is little doubt^ that the operation of the market contributes towards bridging the Lebanese deficit in her balance of payments# According to the Societe Libanaise d^conomie politique the deficit in the Lebanese balance of payments (as opposed to that of the Lebanoso-Syrian Customs Union) amounted in 1946 to about £L 134.5M half of which was the result of trade with Syria, and during the war years the deficit amounted to a total of £L415M. High prices of Syrian agricultural products particularly cereals - in 1946 the Lebanon is estimated to have imported BL100M worth of goods from Syria, including cereals to the value of £L 5 CM — wore largely responsible# It is emphasised however in the Societal report that those estimates are necessarily approximate and it is doubtful whether in the calculations sufficient allowance is made for the very large profits made on foreign imported goods re-exported by the Lebanon to Syria during the war and immediately afterwards# Furthermore owing to the abnormally high price of Syrian cereals these figures cannot be taken as a reliable guide for the future# (5) Budgetary Position. The State budget has increased ton-fold since 1939# Receipts have regularly shown a surplus over expenditure until 1948-9 when military expenditure and refugee relief necessitated additional appropriations in addition to exhausting the reserve fund. Indirect taxation provides 83 &gt;&amp; of the revenue. In 1946 Estimates less than £L 15M was allocated to productive expenditure out of the total of £L 38 - public works £L 11#4 M education £L 1M, public health £L 2M, agriculture £L# 6 M. The balance amounting to £L 43 M Is divided to cover salaries and various administrative expenses# Taxationz'-' nut Taxation is rolativoly high - it is estimated as £11 sterling per head of the population as compared with ?n | t0 + ing -, i 5 Paloat i r iQ under the Mandate and £4 sterling in Egypt and Syria - and owing to the fact that 85 * of produCGd b y indirect taxation there is no doubt that the burden is inequitably distributed- income tax was introduced in December, 1945 but owing to tho inefficiency of tho rovonuo authorities and their fh verify doc lar at ions receipts have been, small. K^iorm of the law including a lowering of the exemption rate and increased rates for higher income groups ‘seems ^“°^ary. Vested interests have so far succeeded in attompts to effect any change or to introduce a system of death duties and a reform of land taxation. S ^ 1 in custom s receipts as a result of tho inovit^hio imP mu tS may in ^ irnQ mak0 thoso desirable changes v lhQro seems little doubt that the country bG f ncod with budgetary difficulties, even the ^lf°? dl d a p &gt;r i 0 X ?? naitU S 0 on th0 arinotl Forces and on the relief of Palestine refugees is eliminated. 4« Surveys In 194/ Sir Alexander Gibb and Partn* :rs were engaged ^ *{J° Lebanese Government to survey tho economic resources More^neciiaf 1 ^^ Pobraary1948 the Report was submitted. i?^ r +v, oP S C f?i Ll ? 0d sarv °y s h ave boon carried out by advisers labour B »n^ 1Sh E f st Office and include health, 9 affairs, agriculture, forestry and soil beonlnvit-&gt;d ^tatistics.

The results were published early in 1948 and a remarkable book entitled 'Plan de Reconstruction d^conomie Llbanaise et de Reforme de I'Etat'. , l^asis of these reports the Lebanese Government is in the fortunate position of being able to elaborate a balanced programme on economic and social development. 5* Population No reliable census has ever been taken. The last official census was taken in 1932. That taken in 1943 in connexion with the Cereals Collection Scheme gives the total population at 1 #0o4pOOO of which 33«5% is urban and 66*5$&gt; rural. Approximately half the population is Christian and half Moslem. Having regard to the limited resources of the country there is no doubt that the Lebanon is at present over populated. The rate of population increase is estimated at 16 ^&gt; and unless possibilities for emigration intervene a total population may reach 2 , 000,000 by 1967* In view of its present over-population and the substantial increase rate, the possibilities of resettlement of Palestine refugees aro clearly limited. It is true that in the past the country has shown a surprising capacity for absorbing immigrants. During the past three decades some 200,000 Americans were resettled in Syria and Lebanon (since 1946 many of these have elected to be M ^epatriated ,, to SovietArmenie) and more recently Christian elements from Syria have established themselves in Beirut. In general Lebanese, particularly Christian, take pride in their country s role as a place of refuge in the Middle East. Nevertheless the Lebanese Government have indicated that they are unable to agree to the resettlement of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. The only possibility of the country contributing to resettlement appears to lie in the full economic develop ment of Lebanon (and of its ‘hinterland Syria). In that case employment might be available for a small number of Palestinians, mainly of the urban type, as a result of intensified commercial and industrial activity in the Lebanon. In the past the population was kept down by large-*scale emigration. The heaviest emigration took place during the period of Turksih rule and slowed down during the Mandatory period partly because of improved conditions in the Lebanon and partly as a result of immigration quotas introduced in other countries. It is estimated that there are about as many Lebanese living^abroad as there are in the mother country, i.e. over 1 million. Of these between 300 and 350,000 have retained their Lebanese nationality. Some 400,000 emigrants are established in the U.S.A, Large numbers have also settled in British dominions and colonies - 25,000 in Canada, 15,000 in Australia, 10,000 in South Africa, and 7,000 in West Africa, An important Lebanese colony has for many years existed in Manchester in connexion with the textile trade. The vast majority of Lebanese emigrants in the past devoted their energies to commerce and many from very small beginnings amassed large fortunes. Emigrants remittances in 1946 amounted to some £4 million sterling and their capital has been estimated at several milliard dollars. /TheThe emigrants of the future are likely to be of a different type - doctors, engineers, and other professional men and their services may be of value in the development of backward areas, both in the Middle East and in colonial territories# It is noteworthy that many of the Lebanese perform valuable services under British auspices both in Egypt and in the Sudan# 6 # Area The total estimated area of the Lebanon is 2,600,000 acres , | of this area is mountainous# Cultivated 575,000 acres 22 .1% of total area. Uncultivated 75,000 acres 2.9% of total area# Forest • 185,000 acres 7.1% of total area# Suitable for afforestation 640,000 acres 24.6% of total area. Rocky &amp; waste 1 , 125,000 acres 43.3$ of total area. 2 , 600,000 acres 100 .% of total area. 7# • Agriculture As indicated above about 575*000 acres or approximately 22% of the countryare at present under cultivation# Of this 110,000 acres are irrigated. The distribution is as follows:-* In the plains: unirrigated 240,000 acres Irrigated 85*000 acres In the mountains: unirrigated 225 ;000 acres Irrigated 25,000 acres It is impossible to assess without extensive and detailed surveys how much more land might reasonably be brought under cultivation* Some estimates have put the total as high as 450,000 acres, but the greater proportion of this will have to be provided by terracing the mountain slopes which is a slow and costly process, and which can only be justified for the planting of new olive groves or where water is available for the cultivation of fruit trees. It is concluded in the Gibb Report that the Lebanon must devote her energies to intensification of cultivation of those arable lands already ploughed rather than attempt to bring new lands into use#• The most effective manner of doing so is by increasing tte area under irrigation. 6 * Irrigation The Lebanese main natural resource is water.- The country enjoys a fair annual rainfall over most areas. Though the greater part of this falls during the winter period lasting about seven months and there is considerable variation from year-to-year, many of the rivers and streams have a fair flowof water even at the end of the long rainless summer* When the rain ceases the rivers are fed by melting snows. There are also believed to be considerable sources of sub-soil water* The need for the maximum exploitation of the country’s water resources for irrigation, domestic use and•hydro-electric development is obvious* Certain projects already in hand, a drainage scheme in the South Beqaa Valley and irrigation schemes at Lake Yamouneh, and the Akkar Plain and at Qasimiyeh near Tyre* The total area commanded by these schemes is about 90,000 acres and it is estimated that a further 100,000 acres could be irrigated if all possible water supplies were used. The competing claims of irrigation, domestic water supplies and hydro-electric power need careful balancing* Some of the schemes already begun were unfortunately launched without sufficient technical investigations. 9* Cadastral Survey By the end of 1946 only 35$ of the Lebanon had been covered by Cadastral Survey* Without such a survey many improvements in farming methods, afforestjatl_on and irrigation will be difficult. 10. Land Tenure In general large land-owners are for the most part to be found in the coastal plain and in the Beqaa Valley while most of the land in the mountains is held by peasant proprietors* The tenant holdings in the plains are generally large enough to be worked economically but the Aame is not true of the peasant holdings in the mountains, although income derived from the tourist trade serves to improve the lot of many villages in favourably placed areas. The small holder usually has neither the means to improve his land, for example through the use of fertilisers, nor the capital to purchase the equipment and many are in the hands of money lenders. On the whole however the familiar evils of Middle Eastern land tenure systems appear to be less in evidence in the Lebanon than elsewhere* 11. Farming. Capital and Co-operatives An Agricultural Co-operative Society has been in existence for a number of years in the village of Abadiyah* Apart from providing credit for its members the society offers other facilities such as the marketing of produce, the provision of fertilisers and agricultural equipment and instruction as to their proper use* This experiment has undoubtedly proved the value of co-operative eflort and the merits of Governmental encouragement. 12. Crops The climatic conditions of the Lebanon permit the oultivatibn of a very large range of crops from the tropical banana and sub—tropical olive, citrus and fig to the grape, appie and pear of the temperate zone and the wheat and potato of the colder areas. Annual average production of the country’s main crops is as follows:— / 92,000 tons cereals92,000 tons cereals 15&gt;000 tons leguminous crops (lentils, 'beans, chick-peas, etc*) 97 &gt;000 tons industrial crops (mainly tobacco) 156,000 tons vegetables (potatoes form the principle item) 80,000 23.000 31 .000 30,500 70.000 11 ,500 40,000 tons grapes tons melons tons olives tons figs tons citrus tons bananas tons deciduous fruits* The Lebanon*s annual requirements in cereals are about 210,000 tons and as indicated above some 90,000 tons are grown locally* It is clear that it would be uneconomical to grow cereals on costly irrigated land and the country cannot hope to become self-supporting in cereals* The storage of reserves is therefore necessary and the construction of silos has been recommended. The future of Lebanese agriculture lies in the adoption of more intensive forms of cultivation (especially by the expansion of irrigation), the introduction of new and more valuable crops and the improvement of existing varieties* Before the war Palestine and Prance were the principle markets for the Lebanese produce* Loss of the Palestine market as a result of the Arab boycott and the Palestine war and the decline in exports to Prance (particularly before the conclusion of the Franco—Lebanese financial agreement in 1948) have proved to be a heavy blow to Lebanese economy* Fruit growing has developed very considerably in recent years and much experience has been gained in the selection of the varieties best suited to local conditions* Nevertheless the major proportion is still of a poor quality* Improvements are also needed in the grading, packing, and handling* Fresh fruit finds a growing market in Middle East countries where the requirements of foreign oil compands are increasing and there is also scope for an extension of the present small scale canning industry. The citrus crop estimated at 1,000,000 cases a year (as compared with 20 , 000,000 in Palestine) is of considerable importance but it is doubtful whether the area given over to citrus should be expanded in view--o£,competition from Palestine and the demands of other crops such as 'bfuoa.nas and vege-tuhljus which present a greater possibility of export, /The ....The cultivation of olives is important as quasi arid hillsides can 'be used and as this type of cultivation contributes to soil conservation, 13tf Live Stock The following is an estimate of the live stock position:- 500,000 goats 41.000 horses, mules and ponies 18.000 draft animals 15.000 sheep 3.000 pigs 2.000 milking cows* The number of poultry cannot be estimated. Except for goats the quantity of live stock is low. The quality is also poor. This is mainly due to lack of pastorage and any increase is dependent on the intensification of agriculture. In general an all round improvement in quality and performance of the animals should be aimed at rather than any great increase in numbers. It is in fact desirable that in the interests of forest regeneration and soil c onservation the goat population should be decreased. The fall in milk production should be compensated by an improvement in the milk yield of the cows or alternatively by the keeping of tethered goats in place of the free ranging goats which cause so much damage, 14 . Forests and Soil Conservation Misuse through uncontrolled felling, charcoal burning and brousing of goats has sadly depleated the once famous forests of the Lebanon, The present estimated area for forests is about 185,000 acres which could be increased to 750,000 acres. The bare hillsides are a danger to agriculture. More forests would be an asset in connexion with the tourist trade and over a long period the reafforestation might produce most of the country^ timber .needs and provide a surplus for export. The control of goats is essential. The problem is similar to that which existed in Cyprus before effective measures of forest preservation were introduced, and in 1948 the Director of forests in the Lebanon visited Cyprus in the company of the Forestry and Soil Conservation Adviser to the Middle East Office, The latter has recommended the restriction of goats and sheep, the establishment of small administrative areas for soil conservation, the training of staff in the United Kingdom and Cyprus and the separation of the Forestry Service from the Department of Agriculture. Resj^onsible Lebanese are aware of the importance of restoring their forests and their are hopes that progress may be made in the near future, 15. Minerals Geological investigations to date have shown that the Lebanon possesses no metallic mineral wealth except limited quantities of sulphate of lead in the Mount Hermon area. Non—metallic minerals are limited to deposits of inferior /lignitelignite | which exist in virtually inaccessible places* a small deposit of asphalt and silica sand. The last is valuable as it is used in local glass factories and in the past was exported ^ to Palestine. There is no lack of good quality building stone. Test borings for oil have up to date been unsuccessful and it seems douotful whether any deposits exist. 16« Fisheries Although the Lebanon and Syria have some 140 miles of with suitcitae anchorages for fishing boats the amount of fish landed is only between four and five hundred tons. That this can probably be increased is indicated by the relative figures for Palestine which were normally about 2,000 tons a year. Whether a large scale fishing industry can be developed is doubtful since the Eastern Mediterranean, except for the stretch off the mouth of the Nile does not appear to contain very large quantities of fish* a ^^ em Pi' s were made to stock inland waters but they do not appear to have been maintained. Trout in the Orontes River may prove an increasing attraction to tourists and their preservation should be encouraged. 17* Industry Though the economy of the Lebanon is likely to remain, at least for many years, predominantly agricultural, it needs the support and stimulus provided by the development of industry. This is also necessary to absorb some of the increase in the population which agriculture alone even when fully developed will be unable to provide for. ^ Existing industries apart from oil refining and transiting at Tripoli are cotton spinning and weaving, silk spinning, silk and rayon weaving, wool weaving and knitting, cement, tanning, olive oil pressing and refining, soap, jams, preserves, chocolate, alcohols, biscuits and matches. At the eud of the war there were 36,000 spindles in operation Lebanon producing about 2,000 tons of yarn as compared with '7#500 spindles in Syria. The total requirements of the Lebanese and Syrian local weaving industry in yarn (including rayon yarn) is about 12,000 tons a year which is over' 9,000 tons more than the output of the mills in 1946. Expansion providing for an additional 10,000 spindles in the Lebanon and 73,000 spindles in Syria should increase the output of yarn to well over 10,000 tons a year which would not only be sufficient for local industry, but also to provide a surplus for export. There is. in fact considerable danger of over expansion, but the cotton spinning industry clearly merits encouragement especially as it increases the demand for locally grov/n cotton* Weaving of cotton textiles is not so important in the Lebanon as it is in Syria. Production is estimated at 1 ,200 tons in the Lebanon as compared with 7,300 tons in Syria. A modern wool weaving factory equipped to provide almost the entire requirements of the Lebanon exists near Beirut and the goods it turns out are of high quality. Its production in 1946 however was only one fifth of its capacity and it is handicapped by customs dues on imported wool yarn and by the inexperience of and high rate of pay of its operators which render difficult competition with foreign products. /CementMBS&gt; Cement prcrivo ti on arr^intb ':o about 150-&gt;000- y tona a year* Lack of power at presexjb prevents full capacity prodnoi^on* factory situated on the coast is well placed for export - 65^000 tons we^e shipped in 1937 - and expansion up to a productive capacity. orX)0,000 tons a year which is in hand appears justified# The tanning and connected industries which greatly expanded during the period between the two v/ars and was the basis of considerable export trade to neighbouring countries, particularly Palestine, has recently lost ground* Though only partly dependent on locally produced raw hides its encouragement is doubly important to the country,, Olive oil is produced in considerable quantities* It is mainly consumed locally as food or in the manufacture of soap but fairly large quantities are‘also exported. The oil is obtained from innumerable primitive presses scattered throughout the olive producing areas. The need for technical improvement is obvious and the formation of industrial associations has been suggested. Since the war a modern refining plant has been erected by local business men who hope to secure British participation in its operation* About a half of the soap produced in Syria and the Lebanon is of Lebanese manufacture* In the past this soap was renowned ir the: Middle East but both Syria and the Lebanon now import more soap than they export. The industry stands in need of complete overhaul. The canning and pi industry is at present on a small scale and is workirn- Zuider considerable difficulties caused to some extent by the high i;&gt;rices of imported tin plate and sugar. The industry deserves to be encouraged both for its own sake and ior the stimulus it would give to agriculture. The freezing of fruit and vegetables would also appear to be a suitable development* Lack of coal and iron makes development of heavy industries impossible. The Lebanon’s raw materials are the product of the land and industry should in general be based on the transformation and processing of these products. Possible exceptions are the manufacture of nylon and fertilisers,markets for which are considerable The former u.^vur calls for heavy capital expenditure and for technical skill wh 1 eh is not at present to be found in the country, ihe manufacture of nitrogenous fertilisers - the requirements of the Lebanon and Syria are likely to reach 20,000 tons a year in the near future ' calls not only for capital and technical skill but also for power. It has been estimated that’ 10,000 kws. are required for the production of the 20,000 tons a year. A further possibility is the manufacture of super-phosphates and this development which would involve the import of phosphates from Jordan, is already being studied* Cheap power which would also encourage foreign manufacturers to set up assembly plants possibly to cover the whole Middle East is essential. In the past commerce has been favoured at the expense of industry which not in general received the official support it requires, A beginning has however been made and in May, 1949 restrictions on imports affecting local industries (textiles, leather goods and preserves) were irrrposed and the Lebanese-Syrian Ecopomic Agreement in 1949 has provided for increase in import duties on cotton and artificial silk yarns and on textiles. It also provided for increases in tariffs to protect local industries and for reductions in tariffs on raw materials required by local industry to be studied* It should be noted that although the Lebanon has no known oil resources, the oil industry brings considerable wealth to the /countrycountry* The Iraq Petroleum Comi:&gt;any pipe line from Kirkuk is partly serviced from TriiDoli and the Company not only provides employment for many Lebanese, both at its installations and a^so at the small^Tripoli refinery, but is also a source of Cvjsiderable foreign exchange. The refinery has recently expanded to double its output (sufficient to meet the internal needs of Syria and Lebanon), Similarly, the Trans-Arabian Pipe Line Company when its terminal and refinery are completed at Sidon will provide additional employment and further foreign exchange. In accordance with its agreement with the Lebanese Government concluded in 1946, the Company undertook to pay the sum of £ 2 . 5,000 a year for facilities and £ 20,000 (or P 63 ? 'ton of oil), whichever may be the greater as a transit payment. Though the agreement with the Iraq. Petroleum Gonrpany concluded in 1931 makes no such provision, the Company offered in 1947 to make to the Lebanese Government an annual payment of £45,000* 19« Power Hydro-electric power is undoubtedly an important field of development in the Lebanon. The British Good-will Mission of 1946 was much impressed by its possibilities and Metropolitan Vickers, one of whose senior staff was a member of the Mission, have considered it worth while to appoint an engineer to reside at Beirut to watch developments* Increased power would be available for industry, the development of rural and tourist amenities, pumping for irrigation and possibly for use by the oil companies. Control of certain rivers would help contribute to soil conservation and the development of hydro-electric power. Due regard should, however, be paid to the requirements of agriculture and domestic water supply. The present position of electricity supply is that about half of the population is served. Prices are high. 17,852 kws, are generated by water power and 9,700 kws. by thermal stations. These figures present the installed capacity; firm capacity is approx imately 5,000 and 8,500 kws. respectively. Recommendations in the Gibb survey include (a) In view of the unsatisfactory manner in which private concessions for the development of hydro-electric power have been operated in the past a Public Utility Corporation to ensure the maximum co-ordinated utilisation of water resources should be set up or failing that a Water Resources Board should be formed to control and co-ordinate the activities of concessionary companies. (b) Due regard should be p&amp;id to the demands of irrigation and domestic water supply. (c) The demand for electricity by 1956 is estimated at 33,000 kws. (excluding any requirements of the oil companies). This calls for a generating capacity of between 40 and 50 thousand kws. of firm power. (a) On a short term basis the 16,250 kws,r should be developed hydro—electrically and 10 to 15 thousand kws. by thermal means. (e) A further study of water resouj^ces should be made at once. (f) A Short Term Plan should include the development of the following:- /BaridTourist Trade. There is no doubt that the tourist trade could he developed* Its develoxjment depends x^artly on circumstances which are v/ithin the power of the Lehanese Government to control, e.g. better organisation, improvement of accommodation and amenities, better publicity, special tourist rates etc., and partly on circumstances outside their control, for example exchange difficulties and high prices. The Government have already employed a Swiss expert to advise on'development* Before the war a thriving tourist trade was built up but this has declined for a variety of reasons; high cost of living, exchange difficulties and improved communications with Europe from the Middle East countries which provided the bulk of pre-war tourists. Tourists were mainly summer visitors but there are also considerable possibilities for winter sports. The number of summer visitors reached 18,800 in 1938, of whom some 5,000 were Palestinians, 8,000 Egyptians, and 3,500 ~ Iraqi # 4 It has been estimated that the annual income derived from tourism amounted to £L33,000,000. The number of summer visitors in 1946 to 1947 is approximately 13,000 for each year. It is widely believed that the 1938 figures could be trebled. 20 . Commerce . Though the Lebanon is principally agricultural its prosperity is undoubtedly due in a largo measure to its commerce. The development of the port of Beirut and of its communications with the interior during the nineteenth and early part of the twentieth century was a decisive factor and with the exception of the of Haifa t ( developed during the mandatory period) Beirut is the only port on the Levant coast capable of handling trade in an efficient manner and on an adequate scale throughout the year. It should be noted that Syria is the most important market for Beirut 1 s commercial activities. Transit trade is not very great. Trade with Iraq is handicapped by poor communications. Improved communications and a greater economic unity in the Fertile Crescent area (particularly if the established boycott of Israel and of the port*'of Haifa is maintained) might greatly increase the Lebanese commercial activities. There is no doubt that a great deal of business is done in Beirut without the merchandise ever passing through the Lebanon - Lebanese business houses have contacts throughout the Middle East and in many other parts of the world. Tho importance of Beirut as a financial centre has uiw doubtedly increased. Before the war the Lebanon’s principle-Supi-TLier was France, In 1945-6-7 the first place was taken by the United States of America. The United Kingdom has maintained its position as the second most important supplier until 1948 when it took the lead from the U.S.A. Imports are dominated by manufactured articles and food, while raw materials are relatively insignificant. Before/Before the war t &amp; iestine and Prance were the tv/o main markets for Lebanese and Syrian products. Since the volume of exports to these two countries fell c.nsider.ably, 21 , C ommunicatlons. (a) Roads • The e xisting system is sufficient for the general economic needs of the country. In fact recent annual expenditure on the roads is probably greater than can be justified A part of the roads budget could with advantage be allocated to more productive development such as irrigation, , (t) Railwny s, There ai‘e two lines, Beirut-Damascu 3 (narrow gauge, 147 kilometres). Ras Naqura-Beirut-Tripoli (standard gauge 192 kilometres;. Railways of the Lebanon (and of Syria; are operated by a French concessionary company* the D.H*P, There are few years When they are operated without loss, which the Government, according to the terms of the concessions has to moot. This deficit has been due in great part to growing competition to motor transport which has been indirectly subsidised by the Government’s extravagant road building policy. With the exception of the extension of the broad gauge line of the Beirut area railway development is unnecessary but the reorganisation of the present system, including the study of the possibility of the elimination (by the construction of a tunnel) of the rack and the introduction of the broad gauge on the Beirut- Damascus line, seems necessary, ( c ) Do^ts. The two main ports are Beirut and Tripoli# The former has an annual handling capacity of 500,000 tons of foreign trade and 100,000 tons of local trade, Tho turn-round of ships is however slow owing to poor administration particularly in the customs. Certain minor* improvements under consid.eration to reduce wave-action inside the harbour are estimated to cost between £L 6 c to 8 million# Further schemes to expand the port by a third basin at the estimated cost of £L 25,000,000 (Stage l) and £L45,000,000 (Stage 2) are likely to be necessary in the near future# Tripoli is liotle more than an open roadstand v7hieh would bo difficult and costly to improve. The average annual tonnage handled in the eight pre-war years v/as about 160,000 tons of which 3&amp;% was represented by exports# Foreign tonnage handled in 1945 and. 1946 v/as 315,000 and 218,000 tons respectively. Gome development of the port may however take place as a result of the extension of the oil terminal and refinery. Chekka/Ghokka, oaida anri Tyre are suitable only for coastal craft and owing to competition from road transport, their traffic is decreasing# t ( d ) Ci vil aviation. Internal Air Lines are not necessary in view of the siTiall size of the country ana the excellence of its road system# The two Lebanes Middle East Air Lino Transports and lack of successful• countries# Givil Aviation Companies, the and La Compagnie Generale des are handicapped by inefficient administration funds and have as a result been only moderately Their trailic is mostly with neighbouring Xt ^ number of landing grounds were built during the war but are not now in use. The three existing airfields are Beirut, Tripoli and .Rayak.# Beirut airport is used by several foreign air lines# The runways are however too short (four engined planes are e &lt;U ' 3(3 and owing to its oroximity to the town the approach is difficult. A now and larger airfield is now being constructed at Khalde three miles south of Beirut at an estimate of £3,000,00 sterling. he present aerodrome wi3.l be used as a building site. Whether khalde will become an airvort of international importance depends .largely on competition from Lib^a. was planned by British and ^.merican engineers and the Lebanese Government are alive to the importance of efficient management and control. Though operation will probaoly be a permanent charge on the Oomoany T s budget, the airport should prove a valuable asset to the country. Improved air communications are clearly os -ential for a development of th tourist industry which depends on visitors not only from the Mic elle Last countries but also from further afield particularly Lebanese emigrants from the Americas. (e) TaleBhon_a. The installation of an automatio - ? iru ^ l 1 ? 3 pi anno d. Teleplione communicant or between Beirut and the provinces and also external lines are also in need of improvement. 22. Health. By Middle Last standards the Lebanon is a healthy/- ^ healthy countryt There is however a considerable amount of malaria, particularly in the Beqaa Valley# A sufficient number of doctors is turned out by the ivmerican and French universities at Beirut# In fact there is an export of doctors to other Middle East countries. The doctor’s fees are nevertheless extremely high and this inevitably causes a great hardship# A scheme of Social Insurance is at present being worked out by the Government and improved States medical services, e#g# hospitals in provincial capitals are gradually being provided by the Ministry of Public Health. The hospitals of the American and French univerities and also the Lebanon hospital for Mental Diseases (an international institution having its main committee in London) attracts patients from many parts of the Middle East. 23• Edu cation and Technic sal Training There is probably a higher rate of literacy in Lebanon than in any other Middle East country# The focus of higher education is to be found in the American and French universities which in addition to providing general education also train doctors and engineers# A considerable number of Lebanese, particularly the wealthier classes are educated abroad# There is a state technical school which trains some 250 pupils# The standard is reasonably good and instruction is given in foundry work, precision engine©rim textiles and motor engineering# There are also smaller technical schools in Tripoli, Saida and Zahle# British education (apart from the British Council) is however represented only by a few small missionary schools# Though the training they provide is good, the schools are far from meeting the increasing demands for education on British lines# The need for a British secondary school and improved technical training (particularly in connexion with the oil industry) has long been felt and the problem is now receiving attention from the British Council. It is noteworthy that the u diaspora” of Palestinian Arabs has served to increase the desire for British education and British methods# 24# Labour Workers’ interests are protected by comprehensive labour law introduced in 1946# It covered such questions as hours of work, minimum wages, leaving indemnities, family allowances, workmen’s compensation, employment of women and juveniles, trade unions, etc# Present labour difficulties arise from the increase in the number of industrial workers, the very high cost of living, and the unemployment and under employment v/hich followed tlie withdrawal of the allied forces after the war# The Government is aware of the urgency of the problem# A Social Security Plan has been prepared by a British expert# The scheme is based on tripartite contributions (by the workers, employers and the State), and is planned to be executed in three stages# /Stage 1 • • •^ Stage 1 covers old. age pensions, family allowances, employment injuries, sickness and invalidity benefit, and maternity benefit. Stage 2 covers unemployment benefit. Stage 3 covers benefit for widows and other dependents. Three distinctive factions exist in the Trade Union movement a Communist controlled group of syndicates led by Mustafa el Ariss and two anti-Communist groups which enjoy Government support in varying degree. Needs in the immediate future include, (a) Continued close co-operation between the Government and British Middle East experts, in particular the Labour expert. (b) The expansion of technical training facilities. (c) Visits to the United Kingdom of representatives of the anti-Communist Trade Unions. (d) The training of Government officials dealing;'- with social and labour affairs, for example at the Ministry of Labour in the United Kingdom. 25. Foreign Exp- rts . No British experts are at present employed on a permanent basis under the Lebanese Government. There are similarly no French or American permanent experts (though a Frenchman is employed in a minor position at the airport). There is a marked tendency to recruit experts from the nationals of the smaller states. A Belgian is at present employed to advise on Customs- problems and a Swiss has been engaged to draw up plans in connexion with the development of the tourist trade. British consultants have however been engaged from time to time to advise on specific problems. Referencetes already been made to the employment of the firm of Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners for the economic survey and in 1947 Professor Robson of London University was appointed to report on social insurance in the Lebanon. The services of B.M.E.O. experts have also been made use of though owing to other calls on their time they have not been able to meet all the requirements of the Lebanese Government for example in connexion with the creation of a Central Statistical Bureau. In 1948 the Government invited Monsieur Van Zeeland the Belgian economist and statesman to advise them on problems arising from the Franco-Lebonese Financial Agreement and the Customs Union with Syria. 26. Development Plans (a) The Gibb Report . Owing to the mountainous nature of /the..•the country the Gihb Report emphcisises that agricultural ^ development must take the form of, (1) a more intensive cultivation (involving in particular the expansion of irrigation), (2) cultivation of more valuable crops, (fruit and vegetables at the expense of cereals). Reconstruction of grain silos is recommended. The need for improved rural education, marketing and distribution, agricultural co-operatives, research and experimental stations, greater use of fertilisers, the introduction of modern methods and equipment and the control of pests and diseases is emphasised. Development of industry is necessary to provide stimulus for agriculture, to ensure a market for agricultural products and to give employment to labour not absorbed in agriculture. Greater tariff protection and official encouragement are necessary, in addition to improved methods and bettor publicity for locally manufactured articles. The encouragement which industry would derive from the availability of cheap power is emphasised. Both in the interests of agriculture and industry the full use of the water resources of the country is recommended. The importance of the administrative organisation to be entrusted with this development is stressed. It is pointed out that private concessionary companies do not provide the best approach (particularly in view of the danger that irrigation might be sacrificed to hydro-electric power;, ana the establishment of a Public Utility Corporation to develop water resources is recommended. Failing that a Water Resources Board should be set up to co-ordinate and control the activities of concessionary companies. The following table covers the works of a capital nature which Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners believe are desirable for the economic progress of the country. TABLE A .

In 1948 the Lebanese Government applied to the International Bank' for a loan of 18,600,000 dollars. 7 , 500,000 dollars were for non-capital goods and 6.000. 000 dollars for expenditure in local currency, ^neither of which the Bank can consider. The remaining 5.000. 000 dollars was intended to cover eleven projects, including two small hydro-electric schemes, some irrigation schemes, the construction of grain silos, and the purchase of agricultural machinery. The Bank Mission was undoubtedly somewhat perplexed by the enigma presented by the Lebanese economy and entertained some doubts as to the economic and political soundness of the country. It appeared at first as if the Bank had decided to refuse tho loan. It is known, however, that they would like, if possible, to make a small loan for some specific projects as a pilot scheme before embarking on more extensive programmes in other Middle East countries. In April, 1949, the economist of the Mission was sent to Beirut to make further enquiries end it now seems possible that a small loan may be given. 27. docohimonuati uiis _ , . It is recommended that:- (1) The special position and influence of the Lebanon in the Middle East should be recognised by His Majesty’s Government. (2) That the maintenance of the Lebanon’s territorial integrity which is tho ardent desire of tho great majority of the Lebanese people (and is also an important point in Pronch policy) should continue to receive the support of His Majesty’s Government. (3) That while France has important cultural and economic interests in the Lebanon which should bo recognised and the French Government have indicated that French financial and commercial interests should participate in the economic developments of the country. His Majesty’s Government should also contribute to that development. While British interests in the Lebanon are mainly political, participation by His Majesty’s Government in the economic and social development of the Lebanon (as in the development of other Middle East countries) is important. (4) That His Majesty’s Government should encourage the Lebanese Government to give a high priority to economic and social development and make every effort to implement tho recommendations of the Gibb Report. They should encourage the Lebanese Government to set up a Development Board for this purpose and as a first step to put into execution as soon as possible (subject to any further investigation which may be necessary) the projects listed in Annex I and to undertake without delay the survey of further projects (Annex II) which preliminary investigation has indicated to be economically sound. The aim should bo a balanced economy (in which commerce, agriculture one. industry play uheir due part) , as a basis for a sound social order. In particular full and co-ordinated plans should be made of the water resources of the country for irrigation, domestic supplies and hydro-electric development. /(5)His Majesty* 3 Government should, as far as the other .alls on the resources of the United Kingdom available for overseas investments permit, give financial, material and technical assistance for the execution of the development programme. In particular British firms already showing interest in development projects in the Lebanon should be given all possible encouragement. British interests in the Banque du Syrie et du Liban should also be encouraged to use their influence to ensure the early development of the country^ economic resources and to facilitate British participation in the programme. (6) His Majesty's Government should encourage the Lebanese Government to make full use of the very considerable capital in the hands of Lebanese emigrants abroad and advise them on the best means of doing so. (7) In vi ew of the importance of commerce to the Lebanon His Majesty's Government should assist the Lebanese Government in strengthening the country's position as a commercial and financial centre. Apart from Syria the natural market for the Lebanon's commerce is Iraq, Transjordan and Palestine. Improved and closer relations with Iraq appear essential for any extension of the Lebanon’s commercial activities and should be encouraged. As regards Israel the pace can clearly not be forced for obvious political reasons and from the economic point of view the issue is more complicated. Israel is potentially a great market for the Lebanon's agricultural products but in commerce and industry Israel may prove to be a serious rival. (8) His Majesty's Government should encourage and assist the Lebanese Government to prepare a sound basis for its currency. (9) His Majesty's Government should encourage the import to the United Kingdom of Lebanese products, for example citrus fruit. (10) His Majesty's Government should when suitable opportunities occur encourage the Dominion and Colonial Governments to accept suitable Lebanese immigrants as it is believed that not only are they capable as in the past of rendering valuable services to the territories concerned but that the association with the British territories will indirectly increase British influence in the Middle East countries. (11) His Majesty's Government should continue to urge and assist the British Council to establish a British secondary school and a British technical college in the Lebanon. (12) It should be recognised that the possibilities of resettlement of Palestine refugees in the Lebanon are limited. The full development of the economic resources of the Lebanon (and of its hinterland, Syria) might result in employment being available for a small number of urban Palestiniansp(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^S GOVERNMENT) CONFIDENTIAL 21aA0ctober. 194a«.

Waterlow Secretary CABINET OFFICE, S.W.l. 21st October. 1949.THE COLONY OF ADEN AND THE ADEN PROTECTORATE Economic and Social Development 4 In January, 1946, the Governor of Aden appointed a Development Committee to examine all proposals received, to prepare a schedule of all practicable schemes, and to make recommendations for a Ten Year Plan having regard to the funds available* The Committee submitted its First Report in January, 1947* in which it made proposals both for the Colony of Aden and the Aden Protectorate, the former at a total estimated capital cost of £ 1 , 614 , 500 , and the latter at a total capital cost of £ 480 , 000 * 2. The funds available for these purposes were:- COLONY Surplus Balances £1,200,000 Colonial Development Fund £300,000 PROTECTORATE Colonial Development Fund £500,000 3*. These schemes received general approval, but, since the adoption by the Aden Legislative Council of the First Report of the Development Committee, the Government of Aden found itself from time to time faced with major difficulties in carrying out the schemes recommended for the Colony, either because the details of the individual schemes bad been revised or the cost of buildings and materials had proved far higher than was anticipated# It became apparent that the recommendations of the First Report could not be fully carried out, and the Governor accordingly decided to re-appoint the Devatopment Committee to reconsider the line to be taken as the result of a survey by the Financial Secretary of the Colony*s financial resources. The result is that a revised development programme for the Colony has now been submitted for the approval of the Secretary of State. It is divided into three categories, namely A. Unassisted Schemes, to be financed entirely by the Colony of Aden; B* Assisted Schemes, to be financed partly by the Colony and partly from the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund; and C* Schemes to be financed by loans A list of the schemes under these three headings is attached (Appendix I)• 4# The three loan schemes are expected to be self supporting, and they represent important factors in the Colony^ progress. The telephone development plan provides for the installation of a new exchange which would /commence#.#commence with about 2,000 direct exchange lines and would be capable of enlargement in due course* It also provides for an extension of the urban distribution system of cables and overhead wires^according to a ten-year plan# This scheme is regarded as being entirely satisfactory from a commercial point of view, and the estimatedannial revenue of £ 30,000 from 1,000 telephones would be adequate to defray interest, maintenance and operating charges. 5# The electricity scheme is based upon the importance of providing sufficient power to meet present demand and the possible industrial development in the future. It is proTJor 0 ^ to construct a new power station with two new 5,000 kilov/att generating sets. This, and the construction of a new hospital are the two most costly items in the Colony^ development programme. 6. The Colony of Aden obtains its water supply from a number of semi-artesian wells situated near the suburb of Sheikh Othmon, about eight miles from the main town of Aden. Water is piped in from these wells and provides a supply not only for the needs of the town but also for sale to ships calling at the port of Aden. It is now proposed to make five additional bore-holes at Sheikh Othman, and this plan would bring the maximum amount of water which it would be possible to raise to about 4,000,000 gallons per day* The scheme also provides for a new reservoir in the town of Aden and the laying of new pipe lines, 7* It will be seen that a large sum has been allocated to the construction of roads, and another important development is the creation of a Civil Airport. 8. New educational plans v/hich will be of importance to the Aden Protectorate as v/ell as to the Colony of Aden are the establishing of an Aden College and a Trade School, and additional schools for both boys and girls are contemplated to meet the growing demand for education in the Colony, 9. The prosperity of Aden is bound up with the fortunes of its port- and these are in turn largely dependent upon the fact that it is an oil fuelling port of call of the first importance on the main shipping route from Europe to the East. (The Aden Port Trust is a statutory and semi-autonomous body controlled, under the supervision of the Governor of Aden, by a Board of Trustees). The Anglo-Iranion Oil Company (Aden) Limited have now seven submarine pipe lines serving bunkering berths on the South side of the harbour, while Caltex Oil (Aden) Limited, whose installation was erected in 1946, have three submarine pipe lines serving bunkering berths on the North side of the harbour. In the first full year of bunker:’ng operations, which was in 1920 , deliveries were made to only 98 vessels, but in 1947 the'vessels bunkered by the A,I.O. (Aden) Limited amounted to 1,453 merchant vessels, and 87 tankers were discharged, while Caltex Oil (Aden) Limited bunkered 205 vessels and discharged 15 tankers. 10. Stocks of furnace, diesel and gas oil are maintained and the storage capacity has increased by over fourfold since 1918, when the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited first decided to instal facilities at Aden. To maintain the high efficiency of their bunkering installation the A.I.O, (Aden) Limited are /understood...3 understood to be installing additional pumping plant and replacing pipe-lines as well as providing additional small craft for the work of their organisation; while Caltex Oil (Aden) Limited are bringing a fourth oil terminal into operation. 11. The port of Aden handles 1,000,000 tons of shipping a month, and the continued expansion of its business has led the Trustees of the Port to consider plans for expansion in conjunction v/ith the Government of the Colony. A scheme for a reclamation to provide sites for new wharves and accommodation for coolies on the North side of the harbour is now under consideration. It is designed to relieve congestion on the South side of the harbour and to provide improved facilities for ships and better housing for the workers. 12. The Aden Protectorate presents a striking contrast to the Colony of Aden. Whereas the Colony has a population of over 80,000 concentrated within an area of 75 square miles, the Protectorate has a population of about 600,000 spread over an area of about 112,000 square miles. Aden itself has a normal Colonial administration, but the Protectorate is not directly administered by His Majesty’s Government, but is under the rule of its own Treaty Chiefsj subject to general supervision by the Governor of Aden through Political Officers* 13* The Aden Protectorate is divided into the Western and Eastern Protectorates. The Western Protectorate falls naturally into three topograpgical divisions: A coastal belt, behind which are the maritime ranges rising to a height of from 2,000 to 3*000 feet, and further back still is a high plateau which in some parts reaches a height of 8,000 feet. The result of this variation in height is climatic variation which mokes possible the cultivation of a wide range of grains throughout the year. The Eastern Protectorate comprises the Qu’aiti and Kathiri States of the Hadhramaut, and is largely composed of.desert and barren ground intercepted by fertile wadis or valleys, in which are important and well constructed towns. 14* Until comparatively recent times the Protecting Power intervened hardly at all in the affairs of the Protectorate, with the result that large parts of it were in a very backward and disturbed condition. The work of pacification was eventually undertaken, and this has prepared the way for a certain amount of economic development. The total sum allotted jointly to the Colony of Aden and the Protectorate from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds amounts to £800,U00, of which the Aden Development Committee advised that £500,000 should be allotted to the Protectorate. A list of the schemes which they advised to be undertaken in the Protectorate is attached. (Appendix II)• These proposals have been approved with modifications in certain cases. 15. One of the great difficulties which must be faced before any attempt at development in the Protectorate on a large scale can be successful, is that of transport. At present there are no roads which would be so designated in any up-to-date country. It will be seen that it is therefore proposed to spend a sum of up to £100,000 for the construction of roads.'‘**35 - 4 - 16# Minerals have not so far been discovered in the Protectorate, and the most important activity to be encouraged in it is that of agriculture* For this purpose increased water supplies and improved irrigation schemes are prime necessities, and it will be seen that the development programme devotes the sum of £ 300,000 to this object. The most important project of this nature is the Abyan Irrigation Scheme* !?• Abyan is a district about 30 to i40 miles to the North-East of Aden, through which two river beds pass from the mountains of the interior to the sea coast# In the past local Arab irrigation dams and channels have not been sufficient to prevent a large proportion of the water that passes at certain sessions dov/n these river beds escaping to the sea# In recent years an Abyan Board has been set up for the improvement and conservation of existing irrigation works in this area, and a grant of £20,000 was made to this Board in 1946. Now a further interest-free loan from the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund of £250,000 has boen approved, and with this assistance it is hoped to accomplish two principal purposes. The first and main objective is to determine how much of the Abyan area can be brought under cultivation by controlled irrigation. To do this it is necessary to collect as much data as possible regarding water resources, run off# survey levels, operating costs, etc 0 , during a period of at least three years 0 The second objective is to bring land which is known to be suitable under irrigation and cultivation as quickly as possible. It is hoped that a total of 120,000 acres may be irrigable. At the same time it is reliably estimated that a minimum of 30,000 to 40,000 acres can be watered without difficulty each year and the scheme provides for bringing 28,000 acres of this area under irrigation control during this three-year period# The development of these 28,000 acres will in itself provide valuable data for further development of the irrigation system. 18. The effect of such an irrigation scheme, the first of its kind and scale in Southern Arabia, is bound to be felt in other parts of the Protectorate and is likely to be the forerunner of similar if smaller schemes. The prosperity of Abyan and its inhabitants should be greatly enhanced by the increased production which should result from the scheme, and the people of neighbouring areas of the Protectorate and in the Colony of Aden should benefit by the increased production of cheaper food# It is hoped that the agricultural development of this area will obviate the danger of famine which is a recurrent evil in the Eastern Aden Protectorate and to a lesser degree a frequent threat in the Western Aden Protectorate. 19. It will be seen from Appendix II that educational, medical and public health schemes are also being undertaken in the Protectorate. Among the latter the anti-malarial measures are particularly important in connexion with the irrigation scheme for Abyan, a district in which malaria is rife if it is not checked.( tots DOCUMENT is the property of H IS KRJTAroilC ) CONFIDENTIAL M.E.(Q)w t ll 21st October* 1949, COPY NO.

INTRODUCTION m information available regarding these Territories, certain common features emerge* The Territories are all x^oor in natural resources and this, combined with the events of history, have held the indigenous population to a largely subsistence economy, only marginal production finding its way into the market. The means, therefore, to self-help in social improvement have been lacking, v/hile the inclination, if it ever existed, seems to have been submerged. The result is that the resurgent political and social awareness which has affected these Territories, in common with all other backward territories, since the war, leads to an undue reliance upon the government for any improvement, and there is little sign of any realisation that social improvements can, in the long run with, a nation as with an individual, only be sustained if enough is earned to pay for them. 2. V/hile economic development, therefore, is in no sense an end in itself, it must at least be made to keep pace with social development. The poverty of these countries is such that there is no prospect of capital investment to the extent necessary to found national economies sufficient to support a reasonable social structure being available from internal savings. Each of these countries, therefore, will need a substantial measure of investment of foreign capital which can only be made either by private adventurers or through the governments of the countries. The economic x&gt;ossibilities, so far as they are known at present, are, however, not of a kind which are calculated to attract the investment of private capital on any substantial scale*. Moreover, a considerable part of the capital investment needed would be for only indirectly remunerative projects, e.g. irrigation and soil conservation. 3* For the foreseeable future the mainstay of all four Territories must be an agrarian economy. If it is to survive beyond a mere subsistence level, it must be conditioned by greater productivity. For this purpose, and^part from major capital works, adequate loan and credit mechanism is required in all four Territories, which would necessarily be associated with the dissemination by the Agricultural Departments of more modern methods and practices.. It is, at the some time, necessary to stimulate to the maximum extent practicable a lino of secondary industry in each Territory, processing local primary products in order to render their economies,, as producers, of a limited range of primary products, less vulnerable* For these purposes also capital facilities would be necessary.CYRENAICA V-. 1. Cyrenaica has an area of 330# 259 square miles hut the inhabited area is about 430 square miles only. The population is estimated to be a little over 300 , 000 , all but a small number being Moslem Arabs. 2* As in other ex-Italian Colonies, developments inaugurated by the Italians had as their objective Italian colonisation and mass Italian settlement, with the result that most of the best land was alienated to Italian settlers. 3. During the second world war the country was fought over five times until the Italians were finally expelled and suffered a very considerable measure of devastation. A great deal has had to be done and much still remains to be done by way of rehabilitation, 4* The country is poor in natural resources. Agricultural and pastoral pursuits are the basic and traditional occupations of the country and economic improvement must depend mainly on the successful development of greater efficiency in these pursuits and their extension. At present, with the exception of a small amount of static farming on the coastal plain, where some irrigation is available, Cyrenaican agricuDfcure consists largely of a system of shifting cultivation combined with semi-nomadic pastoralism. The princpal crop is barley, although some wheat is grown on the Barce Plain and in some of the smaller areas. Rainfall is uncertain and harvests, therefore, tend to fluctuate more or less violently--so that in some years there may be a surplus of grain (barley) over local needs of ten or tv/enty thousand tons, while in bad years the crop is insufficient for local requirements, 5, Apart from barley, and excepting sponges, (for the reason stated below), livestock and livestock products contribute the principal exports. There are at present no refrigeration facilities and sheep, by far the largest item, and cattle have to be exported on the hoof, the former mainly to Egypt, though latterly exports have tended to deviate towards Greece, and the latter mainly to Malta. Sponge fishing off the coast of Cyrenaica should become a more important factor in the economic life of the country. This has, however, hitherto always been in the hands of Greeks. The Cyrenaicans themselves have never acquired, nor have they ever been inclined to acquire, any skill in this business and, during the Italian regime when the Dodecanese Islands were also under Italian Administration, there was no particular incentive as far as the Italians were concerned to encourage Gyrenaican participation''in the industry in competition with Greek fishers from the Dodecanese. As a result, Gyrenaica only benefits by the imposition of Licence Pees and a duty on the sponges 'exported'. In 1947, the value of sponges taken in this v/ay by Greek fishers was over £1,000,000, of which approx. £20,000 only accrued to the Territory. This matter is-v^ry mueh in the minds of the Administration, but effortq. to^a&amp;tablish aSUmal industry have so far been unavailing. ~ ' ■ 6. Trading activities tend to fluctuate with the success or failure of the crops. Secondary industries of any importance are almost non-existent though there have been some developments in this respect recently, encouraged and assisted by the Administration.-3- (II) Present Financial Position, 7* During the British Occupation there has been an average annual deficit on external trade of approximately £ 450 , 000 , and although the total volume of trade has been increased considerably, the deficit for the year 1948, excluding the value of sponges on which export duty v/as paid but which were not, in fact, true exports, was still in the region of £ 400 , 000 . 8, Prom the beginning of the British Occupation up to 30th June,*. 1947, during which period the Administration was confined within a policy of care and maintenance, the average annual Budgetary Deficit was approximately £300,000, Since then the deficit has gradually increased as a result of a more expansive policy and it is probable that it may reach an amount of £1,250,000 for 1950/51. (m) Possibilities of Economic Development. 9# During 1946/47 a YJorking Party was sent to the Territory by His Majesty f s Government to examine the position and to make recommendations with a view to a more progressive policy for rehabilitation and development. Measures recommended included the establishment of agricultural and hill farms research stations, a survey of water resources, irrigation schemes, importation of seeds and implements, recovery of neglected vineyards, the progressive settlement of Arab farmers with technical guidance and loan assistance, limited re-afforestation, the extension of veterinary services, the organisation of exports, the creation of a fund £&gt;r loans to local industry and the relief of the destitute and war distressed. Recommendations were also made for the expansion of Education and Medical Services, The greater part of these recommendations has already been put into effect and the cost is reflected in the increasing Budgetary Deficit to which reference is made above. 10, Although the measures already initiated are for the most part preliminary to or in themselves long-term measures which may be expected to gather impetus as they are developed, the stage of survey has not yet been passed and more comprehensive planning must await the result of further surveys which are now being made. Activities undertaken thereafter will be economic possibilities condition by potential local resources and the characteristics of the peoijle. It is likely that any major development in the early stages will be in the agricultural and pastoral fields but an essential early activity v/ill be the education and training of the local inhabitants•to play a proper part in the economic life of the country, including the training of skilled craftsmen and executives for commerce and industry. The provision of adequate primary services, is, however, an essential condition of development. Therefor plans have already been formulated, or are in the process of being formulated, for the rehabilitation and expansion of communications, water supplies (depending to some extent on the result of the Water Survey), sewage in urban districts, and power. (IV). Conclusions, 11. It is clear that the economy of the country must continue to rest mainly on agriculture and pastoral pursuits, as in other North African Territories. The first requirement is to ensure &amp;n adequate supply of water and an extensive survey / directed-4- directed to the discovery of underground resources Which will he available for irrigation should be undertaken. 12. The productive efficiency of agriculture and animal husbandry should be stimulated by the introduction of higher yeilding strains and an improved quality of stock, the diversifica tion of production by the introduction of new products suitable to the Territory. 13. The esparto industry in both Cyrenaica and Tripolitania should be brought under control and conducted on a sustained yield basis; a limited measure of reafforestation by herbage yielding fire-wood and with soil holding qualities should be put in hand. 14. The shifting native agriculture should, as quickly as practicable, be replaced by static agriculture and rotational cropping. 15. There are indications of limited deposits of mineral products which should be exploited where economically practicable. 16. There is also scope for a limited extension of secondary industry in processing local products. The country is poor and a considerable investment of capital which is unlikely to be forthcoming locally would be necessary, as well as provision of credit facilities for development purposes.IX. TRIPOLITANIA (I) GENERAL &lt; ..^^ e Population of Tripolitania numbers aLout o06,000 including some 44*000 Italians, of whom about one half are domiciled in the city of Tripoli* the other half 'being engaged for the most part in farming on Italian Colonisation Settlements. The capital, Tripoli, has a population of about 136,000, including 20,000 Italians. The economy of the country rests on its agricultural and pastoral industries and by far the greater part of the inhabitants is engaged in one or other of these, from the Italian Concessionaire on an irrigated static farm to the nomadic Arab raising sheep and goats in the rough grazing areas. Yet three quarters of the total area of the country are always unproductive on account of the absence or inadequacy of the rainfall in normal years and of the predominance of desert or semi-desert conditions. Of the 22 million acres suitable for agricultural purposes four-fifths are rough grazing and less than five million acres are available for cultivation. Of this over four millions are under shifting cereal cultivation in scattered patches (native farming) and only about 800*000 acres are devoted to static farming in which Italian Colonists play a major part. In fact, development in the economic field, which in the case of Tripolitania has meant development of the agricultural industry, during the Italian regime has had as its primary objective, Italian Colonisation. . t Nevertheless, the Italian Colonising farmers brought in their train traders, small scale industrialists* soldiers, civil servants and tourists, whose activities provided employment and brought some degree of prosperity of the country. The Spending power created by this influx* stimulated by the large subsidies poured in by the Italian state, found its outlet in large importations of consumer goods from Italy and, though I-taly absorbed the greater part of the production of the Colony in so far as anything was produced beyond lex al requirements* a very large trade balance resulted in favour of Italy. This period of artificial prosperity continued with lessening degree for some time after the war, and even for a time after the final occupation of the Territory by British Forces early in 1943, us a result of the considerable spending of occupational forces. The cessation or, at least, very considerable lessening in this expenditure has, however, since then had a depressing effect on the Territory and two successive harvest failures in 1947 and 1948 made matters still worse. It is important, in considering any possible means of developing the economy of the country, to have in mind that by far the greater part of the cultivation is dependent on rainfall and that in one year in every three or four on an average this is inadequate and the crops fail. (XI) PRESENT FI NANCIAL POSIT ION 4* By reason of the fluctuations in the fortunes of the Territory resulting from the fact that the crops one year may be plentiful and another almost non-existent, a comparison of Trade Deficits or of Budgetary Deficits of the Administration* year by year, may be rather misleading. The average annual Budgetary Deficit from the occupation to 30th June, 1949, has been in the region of £400,000. On the other hand, as a result of a complete- 6 - crop failure in 1947 and a considerable failure in 1948* the deficit in 1947/48 was approximately £1,100,000 and in 1948/49 approximately £800,000. In the same way, while the average deficit on Trade Account has been approximately £330,000 per year, the deficit for 1947 was £1,218,000 and in 1948 £417,000, as a result of the necessity to import grain to feed the population. Exports,have, however, been gradually increased. The value of these in 1944 was £653,000. The corresponding figure for 1948 is £1,533,000 and, as a result of a good harvest this year, from which some 15,000 tons of barley may be available for export, together with the development of the export of esparto grass to the United Kingdom, the value of exports this year, 1949 , is likely to show a further increase. (HI.) THE POSSIBILITIES OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 5 . Although some minor developments have been achieved in both the economic and the social field, it has not been practicable with a 1 caretaker* Administration and in the absence of any decision as to the future of the Territory to initiate or even to plan schemes for major development. Recently, however, a Working Party appointed by His Majesty s Government for the purpose has visited Tripolitania with a view to making recommendations for immediate improvements and for longer term plans for economic and social development. It is clear that any major development in the early stages would be in the aricultural and pastoral fields. An essential condition of any development is provision of adequate primary services, i.e. communications, water, sewage in urban areas and power as a basis on which to build. Initial development would be in these directions. Other activities would certainly be concerned with irrigation, the restoration and improvement of wells and cisterns and agricultural and animal husbandry research. The possibility of developing any mineral resources would be investigated. Development in the agricultural and pastoral fields would, in turn, give rise to increased commercial activity and the development of industrial activities already existing. Other industries_to which early attention would be turned would be sponge fishing and refrigeration. The erection of a refrigeration station may well be desirable to facilitate the exportation of perishable foodstuffs - including meat. A summary of Expenditure proposed by the Working Party on immediate slow-term development is shown in an appendix. CONCLUSION It seems clear that agriculture and pastoralism must continue to be the'mainstay of the economy of Tripolitania. This should be encouraged and developed by replacing as rapidly as possible the shifting native cultivation by static agriculture on a rotational crop basis and by the introduction of higher yielding strains, and the improvement of the sheep and cattle stock. For these purposes, the uncertainty of the rainfall would point to an exhaustive survey of underground water resrouces with a view to irrigation. There is scope for further development of industry concerned with processing of domestic products, such as the canning of animal products, fish, vegetables and fruit. It is unlikely that the exports of beef and mutton from this Territory would justify a separate refrigerator plant, though it might be /economically-7- eoonomically practica'ble to undertake a joint venture in such a plant for the two Territories of Tripolitania and Cyrenaica. Other secondary industry which might flow from the export of meat, instead of the export of cattle on the hoof, might he tanning, leather working and processing of hoofs and horns*- 8 - APPBNDIX Summary of Ex-pendituz^o rro.pu.a e d l).y tho Working Party for immediate short-term s developmerit in Tri p olitanicu ^ ( additional to existing rrovisiori ). ^/Page 55 of Report as amended/ The expenditure is intended to cover (a) the establishment of Department of Land Use (which will include experts on Forestry, Pasture, water use, horticulture agronomy, livestock and marketing); (b) provision of capital for Land Bank loans and for development of the port oi Tripoli; (c) provision of Leper Hospital, a T,B.

Eritrea has an area of approximately 48,000 square miles varying from sea level to over 8,000 feet. About 1 million acres only can be classed as agricultural land, the remaining 29 -g- million acres consisting of rocky, mountainous areas quite useless for cultivation. The population is estimated at a little over 1,000,000 inhabitants, including about 26,000 Europeans, mostly Italians. 2. This country possesses, in even greater degree than Libya, the characteristic features of over urbanisation, with its large capital at Asmara, a town of about 110,000 inhabitants, 7,600 feet above sea level. The standard of amenities and of utilities such as electric lighting and power is unusually high, roads are good and there is a remarkable railway constructed by the Italians in very difficult mountainous country. In present circumstances, the structure is top heavy; the foundations are quite unsubstantial. 3. Agriculture is generally poor and backward. For the most part productive land in areas of adequate rainfall is already overcropped. Some room for immediate expansion exists in the Western Highlands, where fairly extensive stretches of virgin soil still exist. Here the proximity of the Ethiopian border, with consequent danger from raiding parties from Ethiopia and the prevalence of malaria, have deterred settlers. The introduction of machinery and modern methods and irrigation schemes mainly of a long-term character would be expected to achieve some permanent improvement, but the nature of the country is such that the prospects of any large scale development in the agricultural field are not very encouraging. Up to the period of the British Administration, no serious effort appears to have been made to impart any agricultural education to the natives and agricultural practice is of an extremely low standard. As a result of the inadequacy of its agricultural resources the country is dependent for a very great part of its foodstuffs on importcfion, much of which is from the Tigre District of Ethiopia. 4. Livestock breeding forms one of the principal occupations in Eritrea. Cattle, sheep and goats are all kept in considerable numbers. In this field, as in Agriculture, however, the backwardness of the natives and the inadequacy of their lands limit and detract from the value of their activities. Since the number of animals possessed rather than their quality is the accepted criterion of wealth, overstocking has resulted, particularly of goats which cause devastation of afforestation and herbage with resulting acceleration of soil erosion. 5. Again, as a result of ignorance and profligacy, the forestry resources of Eritrea have been severely depleted over generations. The present British Administration has been fully alive to the importance of conserving trees and shrubs primarily to protect the soil, but no major schemes for re-afforestation could be contemplated during a 'Care and Maintenance ' Administration. At the present time, therefore, although the economic life of the country depends very largely on activities in the agricultural and pastoral fields, since there is little else on which it can depend, the fruits of these activities are meagre, and even the implementation of carefully considered plans for irrigation, ro-afforestation, agricultural /educationt 2. - 10 - oduoation and ro-doploymant of population is unlikely alono to onable the Eritreans to achieve any really appreciable increase in their standard of living. 6. In the industrial field the prospects are no more encouraging. During the Italian Regime the major industry was the preparation for Italy*s war with Ethiopia, In that period the Italian population, engaged ux^on mounting operations against the Ethiopians and maintaining road + , a formidable task, multiplied from 6,000 Capital works on a lavish scale were undertaken ut of industry of a lasting kind there was little or none# The country depended upon Italy for practically all supplies of manufactured goods and for considerable quantities of food-stuffs. When the British arrived in 1941, therefore, they found themselves confronted, on the one hand, by wartime shortages and restrictions upon imports and, upon the other, by considerable potentialities in the form of skilled European labour and workshop facilities. Their immediate °Si 0C ^ :L y2 , t ^ oraforo p was to utilise the available skill to offset the shortages as far as possible, with the result that many new minor industries were established. The principal of these were the Malotti Brewery and Distillery, glass and match factories and factories producing buttons from Dum palm nuts. A variety of other industries wore also established but, with one or two exceptions, they are rather of a mushroom character and few are likely to survive as conditions of normal production in other countries return. For the time being, however, the export of goods produced by these industries forms an important factor in the country f s economy, though the value of these exports added to the more natural exports of hides and skins and salt, etc., is still insufficient to pay for the large imports which the country requires 0 Z* -^be mineral resources of the country have not yet been fully explored -and, while such superficial surveys as have boon made indicate that prospects are not altogether lacking, it isnotyet possible to foresee what, if any, part the exploitation of any mineral deposits might play in the future of the economic life of the country. C 11 ) Present Finan cial Position 1* indicated in the previous paragraph, exports from Eritrea have been stimulated since the British Occupation by the establishment of a number of new industries, it has not been possible oven with the assistance ot these to reduce the gap between visible imports and exports to any appreciable extent.

Confined within a policy of Care and Maintenance, the present British Administration has been in no position to plan, let alone implement any plans for economic development. Nor, of course, could any plans be made ofore fairly extensive surveys had been undertaken and completed. it may well be doubted, however, whether alone the territory could become a viable economic unit, unless geophysical survey disclosed evidences of natural mineral resources so far unsuspccted 0 2. In the event of His Majesty’s Government continuing to have responsibi].ity for the administration of the territory surveys and planning would initially be directed towards the development of such potential local resources as were considered to be economic possibilities. Early attention would be given to the survey of water resources and consideration of irrigation projects and to the expansion of agricultural education, and the stimulation and improvement of animal husbandry. Gomprehonsivo geological surveys should be undertaken to ascertain mineral rosourcos 0 Study should also be made of the means by which a limited measure of secondary industry engaged in processing locally produced primary products could be maintained on a sound economic basis by the introduction of more efficient production methods for both the domestic market and for exoortoIll SOMALIA (I) General 1. Somalia has a population of about 1,000,000 inhabitants of which 3*000 are Europeans, mainly Italians, domiciled for the most part in the town of Mogadishu, The natural resources of the Territory, the economic life of which is mainly dependent on pastoral and agricultural produce, are very limited and the standard of living of the local inhabitants is poor. In the past, recurring tribal wars, famine and disease limited the rate of increase of the population* 2,^ During the Italian regime, which ended with the occupation of the Territory by British Forces in February, 1941* there was some development both social and economic, but the social services provided for the indigenes was on a very limited scale and the primary object of activities in the economic field was the promotion of Italian colonisation. The indigenes did, of course, derive some benefit from the employment provided on Italian farms in the Genale and Juba aioas, by the S.Ael.S. sugar factory and plantations, by the Dante Salt Works, by Italian tunny fishing concerns snd in other ways directly and Indirectly from Italian activities* 3. War and preparations for war (italian-Sthiopian) brought a degree of spurious prosperity to the country and a widening gap between imports and exports was met from Italian expenditure in the country in preparing for, and during the conduct of, their Ethiopian campaign* In the period of British Occupation, from February, 1941* to the present time, the gap has persisted and has been covered mainly by British Administration and British Military expenditure in the country. (II) Present Fin ancial Position» British Administration has done everything possible, care and maintenance policy and in face of world shortages and the general disorganisation of trade resulting from the war, to improve the economic life of the Territory, and to achieve limited development. The external trade of the country has steadily increased as the following figures show:- ° Imports £ 1942 341,180 1945 770,249 1948 1 ? 113*423 - Sports and Trade Ip-exports* Deficit £ £ 110,474 230,706 230,266 539,983 777,397 336,026 o X oood t £1®000!000! h ' t ^ th ° CnrrJnt y ° ar t0tal 3x P° rts6. -13- 2# During tho Italian rogiiUG tho mast important export was of Bananas, fostorod and, indood, made possible only by the setting up by Italy of a Banana Monopoly, During tho war, however, not only was tho Italian market closed but it was essential to use irrigated land for the production of staple food-stuffs, such as maize, so that, until recently, the production of bananas fell to a negligible quantity. On the other hand, imports of native feeding stuffs, principally maize, which in Italian times were considerable, became and continued to be comparatively small. The principal exports in recent years have been of livestock, hides and skins and animal fats and tho value of those has risen from £70,000 in 1943 to £3QO 0 QOO in 1947» With the re-opening of the Italian market, however, banana production has recommenced and a production of between 6,000 and 7,000 tons this year is anticipated. . _ . 3. The present annual Budgetary Deficit of tho British Administration is in the region of £350,000, (■^T) The P ossibilities of Economic Development , whilG sornG roinor developments in the economic lield have already been achieved and others are contemplated, the possibilities for many years of achieving any major developments so as to render the Territory a viable economic unit are not considered to bo very great. In any case, any such major development projects which might emerge as a result ox more extensive surveys than have as yet been made, could not be undertaken in tho present position of uncertainty as to the future of tho Territory. Should His Majesty s Government be required to continue for some time to be responsible for the Administration of tho Territory, it is probable that any plans for major development would be concerned initially with expansion in the agricultural and pastoral fields. This would, in turn, give rise to increased commercial activity and the development of Industrial activities already undertaken. Meantime, in certain directions, some progress is already being made, 2, Tho Salt Works in the Mijortoin Province, which ^n S +? Production in 1941, will, it is hoped, bo again functioning in tho near future. A stock pile of approximately 500,000 tons of salt is available for export -and, provided that difficulties with regard to essential machinery replacements can be overcome, production can bo restarted so as to continue exports when these stocks are cleared. fishing industry is progressing steadily. Du ring _ the 1948/49 season production was '150 tons but the ca P abl ° of higher production and it is anticipated that the present season will produce increased results* 4« As has been indicated above, banana production has been restarted and is steadily increasing* to Italy In 192+8 SOrnQ 1,000 tons of groundnuts were shippedTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIO MAJESTY * S GOVERNMENT.

These Departments and Ministries which seek to administer the affairs of a Kingdom of perhaps 5*000,000 with an income from oil royalties alone of over ki million gold sovereigns a year, are in fact slightly remodelled versions of. the old Turkish administrative offices of the^Vilayet cf the Hejaz. In any consideration of social, and economic affairs in Saudi Arabia the fact that there is hardly the semblance of a ■ nornal government machinery must be borne in mind. Moreover, there is little written legislation, and the interpretation of the old Sharia law is often arbitrary; except for certain figures on the numbers of persons making the pilgrimage, there is no published statistical information, and it is doubtful whether even in the private archives of the government any reliable figures exist except as regards imports and exports. The machinery of Government therefore is quite inadequate to direct any large-scale plans of development. There is no appreciable educated class, and only a very modest start has been made by foreign companies (notably Ara^co and Bechtel) in training native technicians. The Government’s continual financial difficulties, which spring mainly from widespread inefficiency and corruption prevent the establishment of any real confidence among foreign investors, 2. General Economic Background Saudi Arabia consists of the whole of the Arabian JPeninsula, with the exception of its more lofty and fertile southern fringe, and plus on the north a' considerable area of the Syrian desert. It consists,-in fact, of the greater part of one of the greatest and most inhospitable desert areas in the world, with no dependable rainfall, and, so far as is known, very limited water resources. The few large centres of population are spread over vast distances; while except for the 45 miles stretch between Mecca and Jedda, and a few miles at Riyadh and in the oilfields, there is no metalled road in the country. The population is variously estimated at between 3 and 6 millions, but is probably nearer the latter figure; the majority are nomad Bedouin. B. FINANCE 1. Currency The currency of Saudi Arabia is the Saudi Arabian riyal, a silver coin of the same size, weight and fineness as the old Indian silver rupee. There is no larger piece, and no paper currency. At the present price of free silver, the face value /and...and intrinsic value of this coin are approximately equal, but at the silver price level ruling in the Bombay bullion market it is a potentially profitable transaction to smuggle the coin into India and melt it down* As the currency is on a bullion basis, its backing being its own silver content, it is manifestly liable to violent fluctuations in value, a tendency which is aggravated by the long standing custom of the Hejaz money-changers of n rigging' the local exchange rates in order to flepce foreign pilgrims (and the Government) as they enter and leave the country. These fluctuations have a most adverse affect on the foreign trade of the country, creating as they do a constant uncertainty. Furthermore, the country has suffered and continues to suffer a considerable inflation. The total number of riyals minted has increased nearly fifteen fold since 1939 # while the situation is further complicated by a constant, but incalculable, drain of silver smuggled out as bullion. The local price of the riyal is at present low against the dollar, and the need for dollars for purchases in the United States and elsewhere offsets, to some extent- the tendency to smuggle riyals out of Saudi Arabia as bullion. Whereas in pre-war years the riyal was considered to be worth about one twentieth of a gold pound (riyals 10 to £1 sterling in 1939 ) the present exchange rate against the sovereign is about sixty to the gold pound. The Government have realised the evil effects of these fluctuations, which press hard on the population by encouraging the merchants to cover themselves against possible falls in the exchange value of the riyal by charging still more exorbitant prices than they would normally. It also makes it impossible for the Government to make any accurate estimate of its expenses, as the Government must buy most of its requirements of riyals in the open market at constantly fluctuating rates of exchange. Various schemes have therefore been mooted for the stabilisation of the riyal at a value acceptable to the Government, and the advice of both British and United States experts has been solicited. Up to date, however, the Government has proved unwilling to take the plunge in favour of any of these schemes, being probably deterred principally by the fact that they would all involve the renouncement of arbitrage profits; and their realisation that the necessary machinery and sanctions are lacking, 2, Internal Revenues, As a result, lack of confidence in the Government in financial matters persists in the country and is aggravated by the fact that the Government is well known to be living right up to the limit of its means. The Government’s internal revenues are small in the extreme. The only substantial single source of revenue are the Customs receipts, which in the last budget estimate published (that for the Muslim year 136?, corresponding roughly to 1948 ) are shown as producing 25 , 000,000 riyals (a little over £2,000,000), All other sources of internal revenue shown in that budget, excluding oil royalties and excluding pilgrimage dues (18,000,000 riyals) which are not strictly internal revenues, as the money is imported and collected in foreign exchange, total only about 31 , 000,000 riyals, of which nearly 7 , 000,000 is income of a commercial as distinct from a revenue character, being the takings of the Posts and Telegraphs, of Saudi Arabian Airlines, and the like, 3• Revenues in Foreign Exchange By comparison with its exiguous resources of internal revenue, Saudi Arabia’s annual and fairly regular foreign exchange revenues are considerable. The latest calculations, which take recent wind-falls and changes in oil production into account, show /these,,,these revenues to be as follows: approximate: all figures are necessarily ! a) Oil royalties from ARAMCO b) ARAMCO’s local expenditure c) Government Pilgrimage Dues £ sterling d) Local expenditure by pilgrims £ sterling e) Oil royalties from Pacific Western Oil Company (Koweit Neutral Zones) (f) ARAMCO (off-shore) (g) Tapline £:Gold 4,700,000 # 25 , 000,000 2 , 500,000 7 , 500,000 # 1 , 000,000 minimum # 2 , 000,000 Unknown* Total expenditure in Saudi Arabia is to be #125,000,000 ap proximately* Of this some will be loc^.1 expenditure* Local expenditure will continue after Tapline has been completed. Details of the Tapline agreement are not available - it has not yet been signed with the Saudi Arabian Government - but the Government are said to have been promised not less favourable terms than those Tapline may accord other Governments. In addition the Saudi Arabian Government have recently received a once-only dov/n payment of # 9 , 500,000 and have been guaranteed a minimum annual royalty of #1,000,000 by the Pacific Western Oil Company for the concession to exploit the Saudi Arabian share of the oil in the Neutral Zone between Koweit and .Saudi Arabia. They have also been guaranteed a minimum annual royalty of #2,000,000 by the Arabian American Oil Company in respect of the right to exploit off-shore oil opposite the Saudi Arabian coast in the Persian Gulf. Saudi Arabia is in fact the largest gold and dollar earner in the Middle East. This condition of comparative affluence however has only existed since 1946 , when the output of oil turned sharply upwards. Before that date the Government was constantly overdrawn on its royalties. Despite the con- .siderable income accruing from oil and other revenues, the Government is in constant financial difficulties, largely of its own making, from improvident spending and inadequate (if not non existent) budgetary control. These difficulties are clearly apparent to local business circles, and v/hen combined with the well-known inefficiency and corruption of the Government, and the anticipated falling-off in oil royalties in consequence of the cut-back in production, prevent the establishment of any real confidence* The Government's revenue is now fully absorbed by the-public-works projects at present in hand. Until there is a marked improvement in the Government's financial situation which can probably only be'effected by financial reforms and increased efficiency (since they cannot rely on discovering large fresh sources of revenue), it is not practicable to think in terms of ambitious new projects involving further large capital expenditure. The first essential for the development of Saudi Arabia is manifestly the establishment of a sound internal.financial system, which in its turn will allow of the stabilisation of the riyal, ot of some new medium of exchange. The first impulse toward* such a development must however come from the Government itself Any endeavour to force it on them would irritate their national pride, not to mention the vested interests, and. would certainly meet with an obstinate resistance. It may well be•that'nothing short of a really grave financial crisis will drive them to take any serious measures to put their house in order. /Concurrently...2 * A nimal Husbandry Animal husbandry, tho herding of camels, sheep, goats and horses, and in Hasa province the raising of a particularly fine type of white donkey, was until very few years ago the staplo industry of the bulk of the bedouin population of the interior, but this is rapidly changing with the advent of the motor car as the normal means of desert transport. Camels, sheep and hides are exported to Iraq, Syria and Egypt, but the emphasis is now on the beast of burden and the butcher*s needs, rather than on the costly riding camel of other days# Horse breeding in Arabia is almost dead. These developments have impoverished the tribes so far as their traditional source of income is concerned, but in compensation some few have boon partially settled on the land in recent years by I bn Saud and a certain amount roaches the tribes from the oil developments in Hasa, (in remittances from their relatives or more indirectly) It is also of interest that in tho current financial year approximately £ 1 , 000,000 is being paid to tho tribes in the subsidies which go some way to alleviating their age-old lot of being on the verge of starvation. This represents an increase of over 100 £ on the figures originally budgeted for# 3* Minerals other than oil The only mineral other than oil so far located in commercially workable quantities in Saudi Arabia is gold and the copper, silver and some other metals found in conjunction with it. Gypsum is also quarried. The precious metals are being extracted by modern chemical processes by tho Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate, a nominally British Comp,any having mainly American capital, at Mahad Dahab, roughly half way between Jedda and Medina. The undertaking is, however, not very large and there is so far no guarantee that any alternative site can be found to which activity could be transferred when the existing mine is worked out (probably in 2 or 3 years time). Surveys are, however, continuing in half a dozen areas under the direction of Karl Peters, an American mining consultant employed by the Government, who is confident that minerals are to be found in economically worth-while quantities in some at least of those areas. Apart from this, rock salt is quarried at Jizan near tho Yemen border, and a cement plant is to be constructed at Dammam on the Persian Gulf# There are rumours that a glass factory, for which sands found on the East coast would make excellent raw material, is to be built also# 4. Oil It is on oil that the present prosperity of Saudi Arabia is based#. .(Previously it depended on the pilgrimage revenues)# The Arabian American Oil Company (originally the Californian Standard Oil Company) obtained a concession covering the eastern portion of Nejd in 1933# snd the concession was subsequently progressively extended to cover the greater part of the country. The renunciation of certain areas has begun but this will not involve the Saudi Arabian Government in any loss' of revenue. Oil was discovered in commercial quantitiesquantities in 1938, and since that date both production and proved reserves have steadily increased. Current production is at the rate of* about 450*000 barrels per day. and for a period of three days in late 1948 off-take'-was experimentally stopped up to a maximum of nearly 600.000 barrels a day. If demand warranted it, and if sufficient tanker? or pipeline capacity and stabilisers wore available to transport the oil, this rate could, it is believed, bo maintained indefinitely. Throe fields are at present in operation and four others are under investigation and development. The current rate of production ropresonts a royalty payment of rather over 4 , 700,000 gold pounds a year. Arabian American Oil Company has a wide programme of development and capital expenditure; the construction of ,a pipeline to Sidon, a port in the Lebanon is also proposed. 5« Water supply _ adequate supplies can bo located, the Government is planning for the provision of piped water to Mecca, Yonbo and other towns. 6 . Communications . Gavornment has in progress a number of projects of which the most important are connected with communications. Deep water jetties are under construction at Jedda, and at Dammam on the east coast. The road from Jodda to Medina is to. be graded and metalled, and there is talk of doubling the road from Jedda to Mecca. A railway is under • construction from Dhahran and Dammam to Riyadh, though it is doubtful when or whether it will be taken beyond Abquiq in the oil fields; despite favourable reports by the American engineers who conducted the survey for the lino, it is questionable whether its extension to Riyadh would bo an economic proposition. In addition, the Government-owned. • Saudi Arabian Airlines provide an effective, if irregular, system of trans-peninsular air services. Other projects of lessor economic importance, although of great value in instilling an appreciation of higher standards of living, are the supply of electricity to .Jedda, Mecca and Taif, to shortly by Medina, and the provision of a pure w f tQI \ supply for Jedda. This last, although not complete, is already operative, and is of the greatest benefit to the health and comfort of the town people. of* &amp; 1 1S0 a Go y Qrnmont scheme for the installation of modem telephone systems in the towns of the Hejaz. ?• Education • Except in the religious sphere there are very few organs of higher or technical education in the country- schools are few and even .elementary technical education is ' hardly available outside Mecca and Dhahran. The Arabian • Oil Company have undertaken an .educational scheme at the latter which is mainly intended to benefit their own operations by raising the standard of their intake of labour* 4 labour, but which has rocoivcd some Government encouragement.#r 8 . Health In a country so backward and undeveloped as Saudi -Arabia it is natural that the health problems are innumerable* t There is an urgent need for greater facilities for workers in preventive medicine as well as in pathology. In the fields of preventive medicine not only the general work of hygien^o , .and elimination of insect borne diseases, but also the special question of Quarantine in connexion with the annual influx of thousands of pilgrims from other countries of the Moslem world, present an enormous problem, the solution of which has only begun to be attempted.&gt; « In - the field of preventive medicine there is a special need for ophthalmological work. (Of patients attending for eye treatment in Jedda, a quarter are blind in one or both eyes.) *, Until recently medical work in Saudi Arabia was conducted almost entirely by Syrians. A small group of Syrian doctors was established at.Jedda under a Syrian director for public health. In 1948, however, a British public health expert. Doctor Gorki!!, and an export in pathology. Colonel Manifold have been appointed to advise on the reorganisation of the health system with particular reference to the pilgrim quarantine arrangements, and a British eye •■specialist, Doctor Longinotto has been working for the past 2^ years in .the Jodda Government General Hospital. In addition, a field ambulance, manned by two German doctors, has been travelling round the interior. The British advisors appointed by the-:Government have proposed a large scale plan of reorganisation and development for the country’s health services. Already three million rtyale have been allocated by the Government for this purpose and. it is intended to enlarge the hospital at Jedda and to build a new eye hospital there, ;and also to build a hospital , at Dammam on 'the Persian Gulf. A hospital .with 140 bods has also recently boon opened in Mecca. A -school for training sanitary inspectors, is to be established at Jodda and a Sudanese Public Health Inspector is to be appointed. Recommendations for starting a school for training nurses midwives and health visitors, under British direction, have been made. Doctor Gorki11 has already obtained some .of the essential equipment from this country and a considerable quantity of medical stores have been presented to the Saudi-Arabian Government by His Majesty’s Government. The equipment already installed includes X-ray apparatus and machines for the large-scale disinfestation of the fly-ridden towns. It would thus appear that Dr. Gorki11 has succeeded, by his energy and enthusiasm, in establishing a new approach to medical problems in Saudi Arabia. In a recent letter, he has written that: ”1 believe the biggest difficulties are over, i.e. (a) the Syrian opposition, (b) Islamic.conservative opposition, (c) the starting of the charges.” ‘ DEMPLOYMENT OF AXPaRTS Apart from tho British Military Mission and tho British Civil Air Training Mission (whoso scopo is vary rostrictod) thp only non-d.ommoreial foreign exports as distinct from foreigners employed in subordinate positions in the country, are the two British health experts, and various doctors, including a British Ophthalmologist, With these exceptions and apart from .the advice of financial experts already mentioned^ and from an Egyptian Financial and Fiscal Mission which arrived in the summer of 1949 no request has been made for tho services of any foreign experts in an advisory capacity, ^In any case those already in the country have been able to achieve little beyond tho submission of recommendations E, RECOMMENDATIONS While recognising that tho scope for direct action by His Majesty's Government in Saudi Arabia is at present limited, the Working Party recommend that His Majesty's Government should a) miss no opportunity of tendering advice or making expert consultants available, or of encouraging the Saudi Arabian Government to ask for such advice and for economic surveys. b) to facilitate, even, if essential, to tho extent of subsidising them, tho appointment of any British subordinates whom the Saudi Arabian Government may decide to employ (e.g. medical and public health personnel) c) to seek, (perhaps through tho agency of British Banks established, or to be established in Saudi Arabia) continuously to tender sound financial advice, d) to be ready, should Saudi Arabia seek for any loan, and especially should a major financial crisis develop, to be ready in conjunction with the United States Government to attach such conditions to any loan granted as will promote orthodox financing and proper budgetary control. a) f) g) to encourage as far as opportunities may offer all educational projects, and more particularly technical education, especially by providing facilities for technical training of Saudi Arabs outside Saudi Arabia. to facilitate the prompt completion of such projects as tho Saudi Arabian Government may undertake by making available tho necessary plant and materials.

A similar Paper on the P Lebanon is nearing completion. , ^gency of economic problems - in most oases ° f Gxl ^ting wealth would not be enough to w!«rM dan S e i*ously low standards of the masses*- became innediately apparent. With the work thus far advanced, and particularly as in a number of countries there were indications that a start was likely to be made in the near future with the execution of certain schemes, it was felt that an^Interim Report was called for. The need for proceeding empirically with development impressed itself + ? y^ G ^ 0m !™?+^ e an early sta ge and this was considered to be an additional reason for submitting an Interim Paner in preference to awaiting the completion of an overall P development plan for the whole area. ■ ' ’ 5. Moreover four of the five c ountries ‘already studied are those in which econcimic development offers the best prospect of an early solution of the urgent problem of the Palestinian refugees. In Syria and Iraq there are* vast undeveloped areas the cultivation of which would contribute not only to the economies of the countries conceited but also to the agricultural resources of the Middle East as • a whole and even of the world. The Lebanon and Jordan are comparatively small countries and the possibilities of economic development are in comparison limited. The former is, however, in many respects the most advanced of all Arab countries and if fully developed might serve as an example to its less favourably placed neighbours; the latter is the Arab country where British influence is most directly f®lt and where in consequence the prospect of early progress /in- 2 - in the economic field is likely to be greatest. The.fift^ country, Egypt, is important because of the far-reaching Nile Waters T Project on which a beginning has already been made and also because of its serious population problem. 6 . The attached-paper, together with the supporting ’’country papers”, were considered at the Conference of His Majesty’s..Representatives in the Middle East, which was held in London from July 2lst to July 28th. 7. The Conference of His Majesty’s Representatives in the .Middle East laid particular stress on the-following points:- (a) . The v-ital importance of the Middle East to the U.K. in peace aid war; (b) the fact that side by side with pressure from His Majesty’s Government for better administration and for the spread of education to encourage public spirit, progress in economic aid social development must be an essential factor in ’ improving .conditions in Middle East countries and combating the growth of communism; (c) unless ; the U.K. is able and willing to make a considerable contribution to a programme of economic and social development .her position in the Middle East, which is vital to her oh political, strategic and economic grounds alike, will be gravely and perhaps fatally jeopardised. 8 . • Strategically the Middle East is an area of cardinal importance second only to the U.K. itself. It is a focal point of communications, a source of oil, a shield to Africa and the Indian ocean, and an irreplaceable offensive base. 9# In the-economic sphere the importance of the Middle East to the U.K. ought not;to be underestimated. Without the-‘Middle East our general'balance of payments position would be insoluble.' Apart from the large profits made on oil, the oil itself is necessary to the sterling area and without it we would have to purchase the equivalent elsewhere for dollars. In the supply of Middle East oil to other countries for sterling we are earning a useful inbome and helping to balance'our trade with those countries. * 10.' Furthermore until substitude fibres are found, Egyptian cotton is a vital 'commodity s for the U.K. Without it we should have to buy additional quantities of cotton from the Western Hemisphere for which we would have to pay dollars. The long staple cottcfo we obtain from Egypt is processed into high grade textiles which find a ready market in the dollar area and to this extent cotton we obtain from Egypt contributes to our dollar earnings . 1 • ’ . • 1 ; . . j ./ •.* ' 1' •'.V . » * 11 , Finally, the Middle East provides a large market / for-3 - \GV m fop British exports and one that is yearly becoming larger as oil royalties increase. The denial of the Middle East to 'the U.K. would involve a loss in U.K. export trade of about .£ 150 , millions per annum. 12... The nature of the U.K. *3 contribution to the economic and social development of Middle East countries may be any or all o.f the following (1) allocation of U.K. production to meet Middle East requirements for essential development works. (2) Support for applications for loans submitted by Middle East Governments to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. (3) Larger sterling releases to pay for U.K. goods' and services or for transfer to other countries for goods and services. (4) Direct cash loans. (5) . Provision of technical assistance. 13. .The kind of assistance required will vary from country to country, in all cases, however, the ultimate requirements will be goods (particularly capital goods) end services. .. 14. ^-Disregarding the money equivalent and the manner in Which it is acquired, the matter for early decision is in general the extent to which; U.K. production can and should contribute to the proposed economic projects in the Middle East. 15. The total external expenditure in sterling required for the projects outlined in Annex A(l) of this paper is of the order of £80 million (£90 million less £ 10 'million dollar expenditure) some part of which will be for services while the greater part will be for goods. : The figure represents of course a hypothetical ceiling which may never be attained. It is moreover impossible to estimate the number of years over which realisation of the programme would be spread. Assuming, however, merely for the purpose of illustration that the full programme were carried out and were spread over 10 years, the demand-for production and services would amount to an average of about £8 million per annum. Only a comparatively small portion of this is likely to be required before 1951-52 and the peak will probably be reached in the fifth or sixth year from the commencement of the programme. It may well be that this peak period will coincide with a need in the U.K. for a stimulant to maintain full employment in which event the Middle East market will be even more vital. 16. Some part of the capital works required may be U.K. production direct to the Middle East projects, some part may be third country production direct to the projects but paid for in sterling, and some part may be third country production paid for in currencies other than sterling or dollars. The latter part will not'affect the U.K. while / the- 4 - the first and second parts would constitute direct and Indirect contributions by the U.K. 17. It is appreciated that until tbe Colonial, ^ Commonwealth, and Par East committees have submitted their reports it may be difficult for the official Committee on Economic Development (overseas) to make any firm recommendation regarding the relative claims on U.K. resources available for overseas development. Nevertheless, whatever the strength of other claims may be that of- the vital Middle East area for the- reasons given above, cannot be neglected for long without grave danger to ourselves and it is strongly urged that as and when opportunities for the execution of individual development schemes^occur, we should make the maximum possible contribution.&lt; The interest-free loan to Jordan has already enabled a start to be made with projects which will not only contribute, to the development of the country but also mark the first stage in the transition from relief to resettlement of Palestine refugees. Similarly the authority given to British financial interests to negotiate a loan to the Iraqi Government will, if satisfactory arrangements are concluded, enable the railways development prograrrme to be carried on and. encourage the Iraqi Government to proceed with its far-reaching programme of development in other fields. 18. During the past few years continuous pressure has been exerted on the Middle East Government to press on with economic and social development. His Majesty T s Representatives are agreed that if this pressure wore relaxed we might find great difficulty in regaining the impulse lost, and that if having encouraged the -Governments we refused appeals for assistance the effect on our. position in the Middle East might be serious. Every effort should therefore be made, as an interim measure (pending a decision regarding the relative claims on U.K. resources available for investment overseas) , to meet the calls on our resources which, may be made to us in connexion with development schemes in the Middle East. 19« In the view of the Middle East (Official) Committee, a decision on these lines is .dictated by our vital interests in the Middle East and the; Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs- has, since .1945 * consistently urged the encouragement of a programme of economic and social development in the Middle East. The programme recommended is also within the •framework of President Truman f s Fourth Point. It would represent a substantial contribution to its realisation and might relieve us of further calls in this connexion in the area.THIS DOGUMEj^T IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BHITANNIC MAJESTY* S GOVERNMENT C ONFIDENTIAL COPY NO.

CABINET MIDDLE EAST (OFFICIAL) COMMITTEE WORKING PARTY M 1 7785 . ! 94 &lt; EMPLOYMENT OP BRITISH EXPERTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST The attached paper is circulated to the Working Party for consideration at a future Meeting. C. Waterlow Secretary CABINET OFFICE, S.W.l.II / EMPLOYMENT OF BRITISH EXPERTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST This paper is concerned with experts in the fields of economic and social development^ It includes general administrators (e.g. Secretary to the Iraq Central Development Board, Foreign Minister to the Sultan of Muscat)* University posts, and legal posts'and civilian police* It does not include elementary and secondary school teachers or service missions or'advisers. It i s based upon information supplied by His Majesty’s Missions, in the Middle-East* I. THE PROBLEM The provision of technical assistance is, probably, the field in which His Majesty’s Government can make its greatest contribution to social and economic development in the Middle East* In Egypt, Iraq, the Kingdom of the Jordan, and the Persian Gulf, there is a long-standing political and economic association with Great Britain and a tradition of British technical assistance. In Iraq this tradition is cemented by a treaty obligation under which Iraq is bound to give fjj-st ehoooe to British experts. In Egypt there is now a new awareness of the importance of tackling the social and economic problem; His Majesty’s Government's assistance has been specifically invoked and this assistance will certainly involve the provision of a. considerable number of additional technical experts. In Syria ahd Saudi Arabia a demand for British experts is now developing; and in Persia there is likely, for the first time,' to be a considerable demand for British experts to carry out certain aspects of the Seven Year Plan, 2 . Meanwhile the Truman Fourth Point has aroused great interest in the Middle East and stimulated the Governments to consider more seriously than hitherto the possibilities of technical advice. It will he important that we should he able and ready to make our full contribution to 'Fourth Point' assistance to the Middle East, both through United Nations channels and by bilateral arrangements (See M,E,(0)(49 ) 22 , paragraph 12,).11 • PRESENT position in the middle east 3* Annex I shows the total number of (et) British experts at present employed by Middle East Governments..; (b) vacancies for British experts outstanding; and (c) experts of other non-Arab nationalities at present employed. These totals amount to 345^ 148 and 130 respectively. Annexes XI and III show the break-down (&amp;). and (b) respectively by categories. It will be seen that, the • J i , V' • • categorios of engineering and medicine largely predominate, both as regards posts filled and vacancies. The extremely important field t L • . ,* j . .« . *' ' ' / / of agriculture is comparatively poorly served, 4# The detailed position in each country is described in sections A to I below, and in Annexes A to I. The following conclusions emerge:- ‘ :■ . (a) British experts at present predominate in the Middle East, but there is- a growing tendency in countries such as Egypt, Syria and the Lebanon to seek cheaper experts fran Gemany, Austria, -... Italy and even the Balkans. The largo number of French experts in Eg-:'Pt is partly, no - doubt, accounted for by France’s traditional cultural links with Egypt, but may also be partly explained by the fact that France is the only European c ountry which at present subsidizes her experts in the Middle East. - ' * . * - * • * (b) The conditions of life in these countries (high-cost of living, lack of suitable accommodation, political instability, xenophobia) are such that exceptionally attrac^ye terms are required to attract good British candidates to the outstanding posts, : - (c) All these countries offer only short-term contracts, varying from 2 to '5 years, (but normally renewable). This is a major - deterrent, since it may involve the loss not only of promotion prospects but of pension rights at home, (d) In general the salaries offered are considered by'His Majesty’s Missions concerned to be intrinsically reasonable. But in most cases they represent only the bare minimum required to enable the official concerned to live at a reasonable standard, educate his children in England, etc. If - in the present prevailing • ' scarcity /scarcity of experts — good men are to be found quickly for tho posts which are considered to be important, then tt will be — essential that salaries offered should be not merely reasonable but attractive, . . (e) The Middle East Governments are not, however, generally speaking, prepared to raise salaries offered to attractive rates, since (i) they do not wish to widen the gap between salaries paid to British officials and their own nationals; and (ii) in certain' cases, e*g* Iraq, they are anxious to reduce Government expenditure on account of their uhbalanced budgets, and are, in fact, seeking general financial assistance from us, 5# As a result of (d) and (e) above, His Majesty*s Missions in the Middle East, and the British Middle East Office, have recommended subsidization in certain cases. These are as follows;.^ (i) Iraq Secretary of Central Development Board Expert in Agricultural Machinery Agronomist Two police experts, (All these posts are ones which we consider that the Iraqis should create but which they have not yet created). Soil Technologist Labour Adviser Seven Medical Professors and Specialists (These posts already exist). (ii) Transjordan Possibly at a later stage, certain agricultural and medical posts, (ill) Syria Probably ten posts for medical professors and teachers. (tv) /** (iv) Lebanon • • • • ' ’ ' Possibly two medical posts at the American • ! - f University^ Beirut, (v) . Muscat ' ''■H.V Pish expert. ( ’. .-.v . 6 ., A - further-'important difficulty, not referred to in Sections , • A - I. of this paper, is the dilatoriness and sometimes perversity, of the Middle East -iGovernments in making up their minds to engage the experts whose names are put forward. Oftencandidates found after . a,-long search are lost because they are then kept waiting for several • months.-,- ' • • III RECRUITMENT IN THE UNITED KINGDOM a -7. Hitherto recruitment in the United Kingdom has-been carried ou.tvon a. somewhat haphazard basis. Experts for Egypt and Ethiopia ,. 0 fre* recruited by their-respective Embassies, and the assistance of His Majesty’s Government (through the Foreign Office) is only sought sporadically^' The Crown Agents for the Colonies are the Iraq Government’s official recruiting- agents. The British Council has from time to time assisted in finding candidates for academic posts in Bgypt and the Levant States. Dr. Morgan, of the Port of -London Health r Authority, has recruited medical experts for Saudi Arabia. In most other'cases the Foreign Office have themselves undertakenIhe recruitment. It has now been decided to set up a central organisation in the Ministry of Labour for dealing with * ’ i . v requests from foreign-Sburces for British technical assistance. This Organisation will be responsible for tapping every possible source - of technical expert and putting the candidates found in touch with the appropriate Government Departments. ' It will also, it is hoped, be dble«io'work out secondment Arrangements for certain types of specialist, 8 . Meanwhile the question of accelerating the recruitment of doctors has. arisen in an Urgent' form in the case of Iraq (see paragraph below). The Secretary of State 'for Foreign Affairs has accordingly asked the Minister of Health to examine the possibilities of /V of arranging secondment from the National Health Service to medical posts in the Middle East. — IV. RECOMMENDATIONS 9* (a) Subject .to the provisos at_(i) and (ii) below, we should encourage the Middle East Governments to increase the number of foreign experts employed and to draw on Britain for their experts • (i) In Syria and Lebanon we should seek to avoid offending French susceptibilities; (ii) In Saudi Arabia and Ethiopia we should go slow for the time being. (b) We should press, or continue to press, the Middle East Governments, in so far as it may seem politic to do so, to grant attractive terms of service to British experts. (c) We should explore, or continue to explore, the possibilities of arranging secondment to posts in the Middle East from: - (i) the National Health Service. (ii) the National Agriculture Advisory Service (iii) the Universities. (iv) other appropriate authorities or institutions, (d) We should decide in principle to subsidise a certain number of posts in the Middle ^ast. Since it is difficult at this stage to determine an exact list of such posts (see paragraph 3 above) we should determine, in consultation with the British Middle East Office, a sum sufficient to provide for the subsidization of 40 posts for three years. This sum should then be made available to the British Middle East Office to be allocated at their discretion, in consultation with the Foreign Office and with His Majesty’s Missions concerned. (e) /(o) ..q should as soon as possible discuss the whole question of the provision of experts for the Middle East with the United btatcs Government, with a view in particular to determining (i) An agreed scale of salaries suitable to attract British and American experts; (ii) The categories of posts for which it may be easier to find American rather thab. British experts* (lii) Which countries we should jointly encourage to turn in the first instance to ourselves, or the Americans, respectively, for the foreign experts whom they require*A. EGYPT. C .• British Experts employed Apart from Secondary a n d elementary school teachers and school inspectors^ there are at present 110 British experts and professors employed by the Egyptian Government (Seo Annex A(i)). Of those, 67 are University Professors (including 2 visiting Professors) and 28 are matrons and nurses. The remaining 15 are economic experts and technicians. In addition there are 4 British medical research workers employed by His Majesty's Government 'working with the Egyptian authorities. Non-British experts . 59 experts of other nationalities are employed of whom 47 are University Professors (see Annex A(ii)). It should be noted that there are no foreign experts in the Medical field of other than British nationality. Outstanding vacancies Adequate information about vacancies outstanding is not available. 21 vacancies for Professors (of any nationality) and 20 vacancies for British nurses are known to us (seo Annex A(iii)), Pgsirable appointments The Egyptian Government have recently approached His Majesty's Government for advice and assistance in preparing a co-ordinated long-term policy for social and economic' development. They are now preparing an over-all plan of measures, required in various fields and their timing. When thi is ready they propose to discuss with us the provision of assistance, and in particular of British experts.mm - 2 - A consideration not to be overlooked, however, is the xenophobia which may still.be whipped up when any foreigner - and especially an Englishman - is appointed to a post under the Egyptian Government. (Teachers are, however, largely exempt from this feeling - at least in the case of the senior posts)# Terms of Service . • 1 * The adequacy of salaries offered to British experts varies greatly between the different grades. Pre-war scales of salary have been raised by 1L$,. to meet the increased cost of living, for all grades of Egyptian Government officials, whilst the cost of living is generally reckoned to have risen by approximately 28Q&amp;. As most foreign officials are graded with equivalent Egyptian Government officials, the Government has been very reluctant to offer them any allowances for the increased cost of living, which are not to be given to Egyptian officials. They have, however, departed from this in giving ^expatriation allowances” to foreign educationists and experts (see Annex A). At the top, visiting professors - eminent scholars in their own field - are fairly well paid, and the medical faculties seem to have been well favoured by the Council of Ministers: Dr. Pridie, until recently Health Adviser to the was of the opinion that the salaries offered wore adequate and was able to secure candidates for the posts he was asked to fill. In other faculties salaries do not seem to be sufficiently attractive for British experts. Farouk 1st University advertised in England last summer for seven professors, but without response. There are now one German and/- 3 - and one Italian professor in the Engineering Faculty at Parouk 1 st University, and two more Germans have been appointed. This is, however, stated to be due partly to the poor opinion which the Dean of the Faculty holds of British engineers. • Professor nddison, Chairman of the .association of British Officials in Egypt, has listed the following reasons why technically qualified professors are unwilling to come to Egypt:- (i) Financial difficulties. Because of existing exchange control regulations, they would be unable either to transmit money■to Egypt or from Egypt - except perhaps for small amounts. (ii) Personal insecurity. Press reports present a very unattractive picture of living conditions in Egypt. Many disagreeable incidents have in fact occurred. (iii) Cost of travelling. Although the salaries offered have an attractive look, yet the figures lose their attraction when matched with cost of living and expenses of travelling to and fro on leave. (iv) Contracts offered are usually for three years only. This is just long enough to lose touch with conditions at home, and to miss promising chances of promotion. On the other hand, it is quite insufficient to enable satisfaction to be produced in Egypt. Secondment and Subsidization . In the case of teachers, the problem of recruitment will, it is hoped, be largely solved by (a) a system of secondment from British schools; and (b) subsidization of salaries by the/the British Council* As regards the posts with which this ^ paper is concerned, His Majesty 1 s Embassy do not make any specific recommendations regarding subsidization; and the British Middle East Office do not consider that we should embark on a policy of subsidization in Egypt, They suggest, however, that the possibilities of secondment should be examined. Subsidization by other Governments French teachers in the Egyptian Government service are subsidised by their home government* They are paid the difference between their Egyptian salary and the rate at which they would be paid in France, plus allowances for wife and family and an allowance to cover the increased'cost of living abroad. This applies to the teachers in the Universities but no actual figures are available. Recruitment in the United Kingdom Recruitment in the United Kingdom is carried out by the Education Bureau of the Egyptian Embassy, who from time to time seek the assistance of the Foreign Office,B. IRAQ B ritish Experts Employed Iraq is bound by the 1930 Treaty to turn to His Majesty’s Government in the first instance for the foreign officials whom she employs. At present she employs nearly 200 British experts, professors and technicians (excluding 37 teachers and 8 Service instructors) (see Annex B(i)) and has vacancies for an additional 78 posts.(see Annex B(il)). Of the 61 senior posts at present filled, only a small proportion ( 6 ) are University Professors. In contrast to Egypt, Iraq, employs a considerable number of senior British experts in non-academic fields such as agriculture and engineering, and as her development plans progress, this requirement may be expected to increase* Outstanding Vacancies , 3h out of U6 outstanding vacancies for senior posts are in the Medical field. (It is likely that this number will be reduced as a result of a revision whicli the Iraq Government are now undertaking.) These include 11 vacancies for professors at the Royal Medical College, Bagdad, some of which have been outstanding for two years. The Iraqi Government have now urged that these posts shall be filled by the beginning of the coming academic year (i.e. October), Desirable Appointments The following ar.e the important posts for foreign experts which in the view of His Majesty's Embassy at Bagdad, the Iraqi Government ought to establish:- Secretary of the Development Board. Expert in Agricultural Machinery, Agronomist* Two experts, one on administration, and one on C.I,D. work, for the Police. Terms/Terms of Service. 2 At the end of 1947, as a result of considerable pressure from His Majesty’s Embassy, the Iraq Government pproved certain amendments.to their standard contract form for British officials, providing for rent allowances, leave passage allowances and passage allowances for families. We attached particular importance to the provision of rent allowances since rents in Bagdad are extremely high, (£500 to £600 per annum). As amended, the contract terms were considered by His Majesty's Embassy to bo generally satisfactory and the salaries offered reasonable. As a result, however, of their present financial difficulties, the Irag Government have now cancelled these amendments. They have also reduced by half the high cost of living allowance given to British officials (ID24 a month for senior officials), regardless of the fact that the cost of living in Iraq has increased six-fold since the war. In the case of medical professors, however, the Iraqi authorities have now askod us to advise, them on the scale of salaries which should be offered in order to attract suitable men, and after consultation with the Ministry of Health and the Colonial Office we have recommended a basic salary of ID300 per month - i.e. twice the basic salary at present offered. The Minister of Finance has stated that it is now proposed to reduce the number of posts outstanding.over the whole field and to increase the salaries offered for the remainder. Secondment and Subsidization The Iraqi Government have now urged that the possibilities of seconding doctors from.the National Health - Service should be examined, and the Minister of Health has ' been approached by the Foreign Secretary on this. His Majesty’s Embassy have recommended that His Majesty’s Government/Government should consider the possibility of subsidization in a few exceptional cases where it is essential that a post should be filled by a man of §\at§tanding qualifications ? to secure whom the Iraqi Government would not be prepared to offer sufficiently attractive terms. One such c3.se has already occurred — that of labour expert (see Annex B(ii)). The salary offered for this extremely important post is not considered adequate to attract a suitable candidate, and the Foreign Office has asked the Ministry of Labour, if necessary, to approach the Treasury regarding subsidisation Subsidization by other Governments , None of the very few other foreign experts employed in Iraq (see Annex B(iii)) are subsidized by their Governments, Recruitment in the United Kingdom • The Iraqi Government employ The Crown Agents for the Colonies as their agents for recruiting British experts.G. SYRIA British Experts employed Apart from three Service exports, there is only one British expert at present employed in Syria (see Annex C ). Other Foreign Experts The Syrian Government employs a considerable number of experts of other Arab nationalities (Lebanese, Egyptians, Palestinians) and a motley assortment of Turks, Yugoslavs, Albanians and Austrians, etc. Outstanding V acancies (a) Medical The new Syrian Government have recently announced to us their desire to replace French by British influence in their medical Faculty at Damascus. A decision has been taken here that on policy grounds we should consider favourably any practical requests which the Syrian authorities may make for medical 'teachers and staff. Dr. Bosnian, the newly appointed Health Adviser to the British Middle East Office, has now visited Damascus and discussed their requirements in detail with the Syrians. He states that the Syrian authorities are anxious to recruit from this country ''selected youngish men of sufficient experience and character to undertake practical teachirg in English, of physiology, anatomy, pathology, histology, bio-chemistry, bacteriology and parasitology.' They also wish to recruit three British matrons and three sister tutors. Both His Majesty 1 s Minister at Damascus and Dr. Bozman have strongly advised that we should not pursue this matter any further with the Syriand unless we can be reasonably/* reasonably certain of our ability to find candidates for these posts without undue delay. After a preliminary discussion with the Ministry of Health, wo have said that we cannot answer this question without some definite indication, of terms offered. Wo have recommended that the teaching staff should have the status of full professors (heads of Departments) and that they should be offered basic salaries equivalent to £300 per month. Meanwhile a separate request has been received for three British matrons and three Nursing Sisters. ...(b) Others There are also vacancies for junior professors (not necessarily British) for English literature, science, and Engineering at Damascus University, Desir able Appointments ( a ) Agriculture Sir Herbert Stewart, Agricultural, adviser to the British Middle East Office, recommended in July, 1948 , that the Syrian Government should employ the following foreign agricultural experts An Agronomist .A Horticulturalist to take Mr. Pickett*s place (see Annex A) An Economic Botanist • An Agricultural Chemist An Entomologist-cum-plant pathologist ^ r^ &gt;ro; ^ essor Agriculture at the University if it is decided to start a Faculty of agriculture. The/- 3 - •• : r l • . ■, ■ i! n Tb0 are now understood to be considering the possibility of employing Pakistani agricultural experts. (b) Others His Majesty’s Legation suggest that to implement a refugee resettlement scheme the following additional experts will be required in the Ministries of Public Works and National Economy:— (i) on modern methods of road and building construction; (ii) on methods of mechanised farming and maintenance of equipment; (ill) on village and settlement planning and lay-out. Terms of Service His Majesty's Legation at Damascus consider that the salaries which have been or are at present paid to British dvisors are on the main adequate, even generous. On the other hand, at present foreigners can by law only be employed on yearly contracts, (renewable) and be paid only in Syrian currency. The situation appears to be that where the Syrians are definitely anxious to employ British advisors, they will offer adequate salaries. On the other hand, they are at present tending to recruit experts from central and Eastern European countr.es at considerably lower salaries, than would be acceptable to British experts. His Majesty's Legation consider that subsidization by His Majesty’s Government is the only way of circumventing this difficulty.There are no Tritieh experts or advisers employed by the T ebaneee Government. ^'here are no P-ritish professors or teachers employed by the lebanese authorities. v acancies for British Experts There are no existincr vacancies for British experts in the lebanonp although Pis T r a, 1 esty f s legation are trying to create opening for an Air Traffic Control and telecommunications Adviser. The American Fniversity at Beirut has had vacancy for a Pritich Assistant Professor of Hadiolory. The British Council have been trying to find a candidt.te for this post ? and if necessary, were prepared to subsidize it. But owing to their inability to wait, the University has now decided to appoint an Italian. Non-B rit ish exp erts employed A list of the foreign advisers at present employed by the Lebanese Government is attached at Annex C. As far as His i a^estys legation can ascertain, none of these posts are subsidised by foreign governments. Pesirable appoint me nts His Ha jestv’s legation consider that the country would benefit prreatly from the employment of foreign technicians in a variety of fields, e.r. civil aviation, afforestation, soil conservation and social insurance. m h.ii is fairly widely recognised in competent circles. But at the same time there is some opposition in principle to the employment of foreigners on nationalistic grounds and very consi erable suspicion in the case of particular appointments, especially if the candidate is a national of a country having political interestf in the Lebanon, .e. ourselves r the French and the Americans. It is noteworthy that the Lebanese have at present a marked preference for 'neutral ' 1 experts or for balancing an expert fro k one great power with the appointment of a second expert from another country.British Experts Employed. There are at present three British experts and one White ‘ke^ian expert employed in the Kingdom of the Jordan (see Annex E ). There are at present no vacancies for further experts. His Majesty’s e^egation at Amman consider that a British Director of Customs would be desirable but that no useful purpose would be served in raising the issue as long as the present Council -of Ministers remains in office. The Agricultural Adviser to the British Middle East Office has recommended that Jordan shouldemploy the following senior staff in the agricultural field: an agronomist, a horticulturalist, an economic botanist, and a soil chemist. Terms of Service, His Majesty’s Legation at Amman consider that the salaries offered are on the whole inadequate for the cost of living in Jordan. The crucial difficulty is stated to be that when a new officer is appointed he has nowhere to live, and no Jordan Government could be expected to pay a salary sufficient to cover the rent of a house in Amman of the style and type to which a British expert would feel himself entitled. The Government is unwilling to requisition and the hotel is so expensive as to be equally out of the question lor any officer drawing a normal stipend. S ubsidization by His M a jesty ’s G over n ment His Majesty’s Legation at Amman state that a contribution by His Majesty's Government towards the rent of a newly appointed British official would solve a problem which may well result in a total lack of replacements when the present British experts come to retire.P. : r .5 AU x&gt;I 4R A BI A rs Apart from the Military and.Civil Air Mission, British technical advice to Saudi Arabia is confined to the medical field (see Annex P(i) and (ii)) and there is at present no requirement for .advisers in other fields. There are no British school teachers ur technicians employed by the Saudi Arabian Groverrment. T erms of Se r vice . The salaries offered to the British experts are considered by His Majesty’s Embassy to be adequate. The main deterrent to candidates is, however, the almost complete lack of suitable accommodation. Under the draft contract forms for the new posts, which the Grovernment has not yet approved, the Government is bound to provide free accommodation* N on-Briti s h expert s There are few non-British experts other than Arabs in Saudi Arabia (see Annex P(iii)), As far as His Majesty's Embassy have been able to ascertain, no foreign governments subsidize their nationals employed by the Saudi Arabian Government. D esirable Appointments His Majesty's Embassy has stated that 'there is scarcely any field of human activity in which Saudi Arabia would not be immeasurably the better for the advice of foreign experts provided that the Saudi Arabian Government..... would follow their advice,” It is considered that education is the key to all progress in the country. The Embassy therefore recomnends that: x (a) The Saudi Arabian Government should be advised to employ more and better schoolmasters of otner Arab nationalities. (b) That in other fields we should not urge them to appoint experts until they are prepared to guarantee to the experts executive as well as technical and advisory powers, and to give them, within reason, c arte blanch e as regards the use of funds allotted and procurement. There is no sign at present that the Government would be willing to do this. x /(c)!*» *, ' N (c) It would be undesirable to create an effendi clof s such as that in iSgypt or Iraq whose only object in becoming literate would be to go into commerce or profitable clerical employment. The emphasis should therefore be on the development of technical education. This point is fully appreciated by the King. It i^ therefore suggested that the Americans and we, in association, should pay for the setting up, staffing and maintenance-of model technical schools in Saudi Arabia. * These recommendations fall outside the scope of this paper and will be dealt with in separate papers on education and cultural policy, and on technical training.There are at present no British experts employed in Persia. .A list of the non-British experts is at Annex G* Yacanc ies Outstanding r ”'\ xhe only post for which we have definitely heen asxed to recruit experts is that of Inspector of A.I.O.C. Accounts, An informal request lor a census expert was received some months ago, hut no action was taken by the Persian Government to appoint the candidate recommended, who has now withdrawn, .^e sirable Appointm ents The Persian government is expected to decide that a large number of foreign experts should be engaged to assist the implementation of their Seven Year Plan of development. These experts will either be employed direetly by the Persian Government? or oy the American Consortium of Overseas Consultants Inc, who have been engaged to survey projects for the Plan. In the particular iields ol forestry ana Statistics the Persians are seeking the services of the Forestry ana Statistic Advisers to the British kiddle bast office for six months and a year respectively If, as we hope, their offers are formally confirmed, It is lively that these Advisers will be asked to recruit additional experts in these fields for Persia, Teri,.s of Service nis kajesty’s iSmbassy at Tehran consider that if British experts are enga b ed, tneir salaries are lively to be fUed at an adecuate le/el. They see no reason.to recommend subsidization by His Majesty's government.xth the exception of Arabs and one Indian, tfca 14 foreign expert employed i.* Bahrein, Kuwait and Muscat (excluding teachers j are all British (see Annex :i ). Bahrein ana Muscat have a tradition of employment of British experts, but whereas the latter, in the absence ot oil, can onl aiiora to employ tnerc on a limited scale, the former has been forced (by oil exigencies) to build up a complete administration in which the key posts are held by British officials. In xvuwait, t.iere is a great need for British experts, as the administration is failing to meet the situation created by the rapid expansion of oil production. So far, however, the Sheikh has rerused to consider their appointment. There is as yet no requirement for British experts on the Trucial Coast or ''atar. Ter ms Offered . his Majesty's Residency at Bahrein consider tnat in general the salaries paid are auequate, though they naturally tend to lag behind those paid Dy the Oil Companies. S ubsiaization by Bis Majesty^ Government .

This paper is a revision of a study prepared over four years ago (as E 1823/1823/65 Of 28th February, 1945)* During those four years the Middle East has become established as the most important area in the world oil economy, if only because recent discoveries have revealed that over half the world’s proved oil reserves are located there* The spectacular rise in production from this area has not yet however given it a preponderance over the older established fields elsewhere in terms of production. From producing a mere 6 per cent of world supplies in 1939* the Middle East by a three-fold rise in output now supplies 12 per cent and, with an anticipated further tripling of production will [(on present estimates 3 &gt;f the trend in world consumption) represent 27 per cent of the world total by 1956* 2* In these calculations the production of the U#S.S.R* and satellites has not been included: except for insignificant shipments the total production of this area is consumed within the Soviet Union and her satellites, and there is little likelihood that this pattern will alter in the foreseeable future* Apart from this the bulk of Middle East production enters into world trade through the channels of either British or United States Companies. In 1948, out of a total oil production in the Middle East of 56*5 million tons, 31*2 millions represented the share of British controlled conpanies and 24*55 millions that of United States companies. By 1956 the British share should on present estimates rise to 80.4 million tons (out of a total of 154*5 millions) while that of the United States should, on the same basis, increase to 66*55 millions. The only other interested Power is France whose Compagnie Francaise des Petroles holds an interest in Iraq. 3. As a result, the Governments of the United Kingdom and of the United States find themselves intimately interested in /Middle- 2 - Middle East oil development. His Majesty 1 s Government particularly so in view of its controlling shareholding in the Anglo-Iranr^i Oil Company, Both governments have been anxious to ensure an increasing flow of production from the Middle East, the British because such imports represent a dollar saving and the Americans because the increase in the domestic demand of the U.S.A. has changed that country from a net exporter to a net importer. 4« With regard to oil concessions and production, there has been in recent years increasing infiltration of American interests, independently and in co-operation with British companies. Details of these activities will be found in the various chapters dealing with countries separately. Oil development in the tv;o main producing countries, Iran and Saudi Arabia, continues to be undertaken independently, respectively by British and American concessionaires which latter also hold the concession on Bahrein Island. The oilfield in Kuwait State, which has become next in importance as a producer, is being developed by a company, owned in equal shares by British and American concerns. In Iraq, the other major oil producing country in the Middle East, apart from a small area conceded to a British company, the oil concessions are held by an international undertaking comprising British, American, French and Dutch interests. The concession for Qatar, which is still in the early stages of development, is held by the same combine. The oilfields in Egypt are being developed by British and American companies. 5. The development of oil resources by British and United States companies has had a significant effect on the economies of the countries concerned. In most of the states the rentals, royalties and other payments provide the largest item of the governmental revenues. In 1948 no less than £24.9 millions were paid in royalties to these Governments and with negotiations in progress /for-3- for raising royalty rates in Iran and Iraq, it is certain that royalty receipts will rise very rapidly. Even if royalty rates remained the same, Middle Bast governments would be drawing £62,4 millions from the oil companies in 1956# 6, Oil and the Oil Companies have thus become dominating factors in the political and economic lives of Persia, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the Trucial Sheikdoms and are of no mean significance in the other Middle Bast States, In the further expansion, on the scale at present envisaged, the main features are thus likely to be:- ( 1 ) the increasing wealth which will accrue to the Middle Eastern States and the use to which this will be put; (2) the stimulating influence which, by example and direct effect, rapid development of the oilfields will have upon the economic and social progress of the Middle East countries; (3) the economic interest of the United States with and, to a lesser extent, the Western European and Commonwealth countries, in Middle Bast oil developments; (k) the growing awareness of the oil-producing Middle East States of the position which this development of their oil resources is creating for them in World affairs. To fulfil this position adequately to guide the accompany ing internal developments into profitable channels and to maintain satisfactory relations with the oil companies (for which there can be no substitutes at this stage), are bound to impose a considerable strain upon the present inadequate school of local statesmanshipNo. 116 British Embassy, JEEDA, CONFIDENTIAL 16th June, 1949 Paragraph 34 of Cabinet T ^aper E.

S. ) (49) of 14th r.fry aentions your preference for promoting the development of Lliddle Eastern countries by extending encoiT*a; eraent and assistance to tlien directly, in conjunction with the Covermnent of the United Otates of America ratlier than through the medium of international orgaMsations. With this in mind I recently asked the United States Ambassador wiiether he had any indication of the nature of any plans the State Department may have for giving practical expression in Saudi Arabia to President Truman^ Fourth Point. 2. *Mr. Childs said that he had not, although he knew that the matter was being considered in Washington. He did not, moreover, know as yet whether the United States Government would prefer to work through international organisations or to extend direct assistance to the various countries. lie himself had, however, submitted the following recommendations to the State Department as regards the fields in which the United States Government might most usefully give assistance to Saudi Arabia:- (i) An agricultural survey of the whole country. (ii) A survey of the water resources of the country. (iii) Technical education. 3. The United States Embassy^ recommendations have clearly been of a very' preliminary nature, for when I remarked, with regard to (i), that there had already been a United States Agricultural Survey, tir. Childs seemed to think it .ad oeen confined to the Eastern areas of the country. I find, however, on referring again to the Report of tiie United States Agricultural Mission to Saudi Arabia (1943) that it in fact covered most of the country with the exception of the Rub* al iUali and txie region north of Hail. As regards (iii) Uc. Childs observed that tie Arabian jaerican °il Conpany and International Bechtel Inc. 7 /ere already doing good work in tills field, but tnat it vvould be much better if the Saudi Arabian Government could be persuaded to take over technical education themselves as soon as possible. So long as the King is alive, however, Childs regards such a development as improbable. i*, I am sending copies of this despatch to his Majesty’s Ambassador at Washington and to Sir John Troutbeck.

Since they have again advanced their programme y a week and are already in London, I give below a brief summary of the position other than on railways, report on which was sent in my telegram No. 589. -j-he Mission presented to the Prime Minister on last morning of their visit a document which they will show to you. we had been shown it on previous evening when it was in T 0 ™' .^ e P ^ e Minister did not sign and has informed me that he will not be able to comment on it until at least the end of this week. His first reaction was not very favourable and it will probably need continued effort to get the Iraqi Government to complete negotiations with the International Bank. My comments on the details are as follows: (1) We agree that selection of Wadi fharthar Habbaniyah and nilla^canal projects is sound. There are however differences o opinion within the Cabinet on which schemes should be [gp. undec.] selected.

We think it important to allow for the probability that' Iraq will not be able to balance its ordinary budget during the next year of two without some recourse to oil royalties. (h.) The Mission proposes before development of the Board is constituted an inter-departmental committee should sit with advisers from the international Bank to co ordinate the existing development plans and provide foundation for the work of the Board. We should prefer closer initial work to be done by Development Board. We suggest that it is advisable not to stress the employment of the Bank f s advisers, though it could be arranged that they should be in Iraq and work with the Board at the appropriate time* 3.

Very difficult to give Bank's reaction in view of unclear picture and absence your detailed report. 5. With regard to your suggestions concerning railway loan and oil royalties Bank has both heretofore considered loan to railways and would not be in position to make any recommendations before making thorough examination financial and operating position railways and general economic position country. In any case see no possibility of Bark refunding present railway debt. On meagre information available herd Bank would question advisability pledging oil royalties for railway debt. Has anyone considered possibility permanent release of sterling from account number two for purposes meeting immediate requirements railways or possibility thorough going financial reorganisation railways with view to funding a part of debt with stock. While pledging oil royalties would certainly complicate possibility Bank financing, Bank cannot now say without thorough study all material facts whether such pledge would preclude such financing. In any event with possible exception of any already outstanding lien on oil royalties, Bank could not accept anything less than full pari passu standing for any Bank loan. 6. Bank believes Development Board legislation should be postponed until whole situation can be thoroughly examined. If for any reason this cannot be done Bank cannot comment on any part of legislation until we have proposed text.

FOREIGN OFFICE, 27th June, 1949.CABINET MIDDLE EAST (OFFICIAL) COMMITTEE WORKING PARTY PERSIA The attached summary of the Interm Report of Overseas Consultants, Incorporated, on the Persian Seven-Year Plan is circulated for the information of the Working Party and for later discussion* C. WATERLOW Secretar y FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l* 25 th June* 1949.INTERIM REPORT ON THE PERSIAN SEVEN YEAR PLAN Problem The interim report of Overseas Consultants Inc. envisages the expenditure of just over 800,000,000 rials for the Persian year 1328 (21st March 1949 to 20th March 1950)# Of this amount, about Rls. 440 millions represent local expenditure and about Rls.. 360 millions expenditure in foreign currencies. It is stressed that it is impossible at this stage to estimate how much work will actually be done this year, and that it is probable that the final report will recommend that additional projects should be initiated this year. Overseas Consultants Inc. believe that if Rls. 1,000 million (about Rls. 450 millions of which will be in foreign exchange) are appropriated for the plan now, the Organisation should have sufficient funds to finance throughout the year all projects likely to be recommended for priority execution in the final report. The distribution of the proposed expenditure among the main groups of projects and the corresponding amounts to be spent abroad are as follows Total Proportion Expenditure t o be spent ( Millions of rials ) Agriculture 70 41 Transportation 75 . 16 (excluding purchase of railway equipment which it is assumed will be covered by funds outside those available to the Plan Organisation). Industry and Mining Petroleum Exploration 340 170 and development 20 8 Telecommunications 13.5 7 Statistical services 11.5 3 Civil Engineering 187 95 Electric power 1.1 Education 30 8 Public Health 81 27 829.1 375.9 The interim report does not go into the details of the selected projects. It does, however, give some indication of the likely requirements for goods and services should the Persian Government accept O.C.I. T s recommendations, these are summarized below. /I. Plan- 2 - 1* Plan Organ!sation &lt; ^ Personnel. An unspecified number of qualified experts will be required to train Persians in the grades of foremen and semi-skilled artisans at the lower levels of the actual execution of the projects, and on the higher levels in the ranks of technicians and trained executives as members of the Organisation to furnish consultation services to the Plan Organisations. 2* Agriculture Personnel . A number of foreign lecturers in agronomy will be required for the proposed expansion oi the. si an Agricultural College at Karaj. There will also be vacancies for professional farm managers for the proposed Ostan demonstration units. V- Goods (a) There will be demand for tractors and farm implements to fill the programme of importation of farm machinery. (b) The report envisages the establishment of two fruit packing plants of a capacity of 6.000 tons each during the first year and of three packing plants of a capacity of 2,500 tons each during the later stages of the Plan. In addition to this plant lye-dipping tanks, sulphuring houses, drying trays, trucks^and certain other equipment will be required as part of the proposal to improve fruit processing and drying in Persia. 3* Transportation . (a) Railways The report gives no details of the equipment required to rehabilitate the Persian State Railways. His Maj3sty f s Government have offered the Persian Gulf £5*8 million in full settlement of Persian claims for the Allied use of the Persian railways during the war. Directly the Persian Government accept this offer, the larger part of this sum will be available for the purchase of railway equipment, and we have received from Tehran a list drawn up by the Director General of the Persian State Railways of the Persian railways* probable requirements in engines and rolling-stock# No progress can be made in arranging for the delivery of this equipment until the Persian Government has placed firm orders with the manufacturers. • i * (b) Sea Ports The report recommends the preparation and presentation of plans to develop the ports of Khorramshahr, Bandar Shahpur, /BushireBushire and Bandar ABBas and to improve existing port maintenance equipment. No details are given of the plant which will Be required for these purposes. (c) Roads The purchase of an unspecified amount of road Building machinery, details of which are to Be given in O.C.I.’s final report, is recommended. (3) Air Ports •The completion of runways and other installations at Tabriz Airport is proposed. 4. Industry and Mining (a) Cotton Textiles Personnel . Recruitment of a certain number of textile experts to work as members of teams inspecting, installing, purchasing machinery and instructing Persian operatives in the rehabilitation of Government and private mills, is recommended. Goods The report proposes a 50 per cent increase in the present production of 70 million metres of cotton cloth, the rehabilitation of two Government-owned mills and the completion of the Government-owned cotton mill at Tehran. Cement The purchase of machinery for a new cement mill to increase the capacity of the Tehran cement mill from 300 tons daily to 600 tons daily, is recommended. Plant for the mechanization of the quarry for a new crushing plant and raw material storage, will also Be required* The report suggests the erection of a cement mill at a later date to Be situated as near to Abadan as the availability of raw materials will permit, and a possible erection during the later stages of the Plan of the cement mills at Isfahan, Tabriz, Meshed, Shiraz and the Caspian littoral. Sugar The report recommends the purchase of miscellaneous equipment for the existing sugar factories including handling equipment, diesel generators, farm machinery, spares and service equipment. Chemical Industries The purchase of two additional furnaces for the existing nitric acid plant, together with absorbing tower, earthenware pipe fittings, receivers etc., is recommended. It is also /suggested4 - suggested that orders should he placed for the plant to complete and extend the existing Government soap-making ^ factory at Tehran. Mining O.C.I. suggest that the proposed steel mill at Karaj should he converted into a blast furnace with a capacity of 100 tons per day of pig iron and a foundry for making cast-iron pipes and miscellaneous castings. The plant for the proposed steel mill-was ordered from Germany before the war hut was never delivered. It is now stored at Hamburg and its release has been approved by the control authorities. It is probable that much of the plant has seriously deteriorated and much preliminary planning will be required before this proposal can take effect. 5* Petroleum Developmen t Personnel The report recommends the recruitment of specialised j.rrsonnel to carry out the proposed preliminary survey work in Persia. 6. C ommunications The report recommends the laying of new copper wire telephone circuits between Tehran and Qum, Quin and Kashan, Tehran and Sharud and Tehran and Kazvin. In addition the purchase of carrier telephone and telegraph equipment is recommended, to provide twelve voice and eighteen duplex telephone channels for use over the proposed new copper wire telephone circuits. Motor vehicles, testing equipment and 'tools for these operations will also be required. Plant for reconditioning the Telefunken short wave at the Tehran transmitter station, the 7i kilowatt RCA short wave transmitter and kilowatt RCA short wave broadcast transmitter, will be required. Statistics . Personnel The establishment of four new statistical departments is proposed. Foreign experts will be required to supervise these departments. Goods The purchase of office equipment and punch-card machinery for three of the new statistical bureaux is proposed. Civ il Engineering An air survey of 3»200 square kilometers in the Zayandeh Rud Valley and 46,000 square kilometers of the Caspian coast area, is recommended for the first season’s work. To plan water supply schemes photography and topographical mapping of 13 important towns is also proposed. /It5 - I-c is recommended that this work should be undertaken by foreign specialist firmso Meteorology Purchase of equipment for 20 new meteorological stations, is recommendedo Electricit y The recruitment of three diesel engine specialists to undertake a survey of existing diesel generating units and to report on the future use of these engines as a ^ynrcG of electric power is proposed,* 6. Edu cati on Personnel It is suggested that a certain number of foreign advisers should be recruited to assist in the development and execution of the proposed education programme. 7« Public Heal th Person nel Recruitment of an experienced public health administrator a public health engineer and a public health educator, to .q rvise the Public Health programme is proposed. In addition it is recommended that the regional public health offices to be established in the ten Ostans should be each staffed with a foreign public health expert, public health engineer and public health educator. The recruitment of a foreign malariologist and entomologist is also recommended. It is proposed that these foreign experts should be used not only for advisory and administrative purposes, but also for training Persian personnel so that they can eventually take over the complete public health administration. The report also recommends that arrangements should be made to send abroad at least twenty Persians for specialized studies in public health during the first year of the Plan. Goods Contracts for the public health laboratories, which are th bo established in each of the ten Ostans, are likely to be placed in the first year of the Plan. Recommendation (a) The Board of Trade should be asked to consider what action could be usefully taken now to ensure that United Kingdom interests are fully represented if and when orders are placed for the goods and services recommended in O.C.I.*s interim report.— 6 — (■b) The possibility of offering special facilities for post-graduate training in the United Kingdom of Persians particularly in public health duties, should be examined. We should also try to secure, insofar as this may be possible, that the vacancies for foreign experts are filled by British subjects. Discussion The Treasury are concerned at the scale of Persian demands under the Memorandum of Understanding, for the transfer of dollars and other hard currencies to Persian account. Unless British manufacturers can compete with price and delivery dates with United States manufacturers, it is likely that the greater part of the orders for goods required for the first year of the Persian Seven Year Plan will be placed in the United States. This would greatly increase Persia's demands for dollars. It is therefore of the greatest importance that the purchases recommended in this report should be made in the sterling area. The engagement of a high proportion of British experts to advise the Persian Plan Organisation would have an important bearing on our political and cultural relations with the Persians. This is also desirable economically as the foreign advisers, particularly in the consultative and civil engineering fields, are likely to influence the Plan Organisation in its placing for foreign contracts. Conversely Persians who are given post-graduate training facilities in the United Kingdom are likely, on return to Persia, to specify the- purchase of United Kingdom equipment with which they are familiar and on which they have been trained. It would therefore be greatly in our interest to try to ensure that the Persians select British advisers and that the Persians are given special facilities for post-graduate training in this country.■ ■ '.'■-ye- 6 — (b) The possibility of offering special facilities for post-graduate training in the United Kingdom of Persians particularly in public health duties, should be examined* We should also try to secure, insofar as this may be possible, that the vacancies for foreign experts are filled by British subjects.

C. Waterlow, Secretary FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.1. 8th June, 1949*mm*./ Economic Factors in Middle Sast Development 1, General The Working Party has had before it, and will no doubt continue to have, a considerable amount of detailed information on economic, and social conditions in the countries with which it is concerned; in addition, the papers so far circulated have dealt in fair detail with development schemes which have been recommended or suggested by various bodies, such as specially appointed commissions, engineering consultants or the Middle East Governments concerned. So far, the aim has been to provide a largely uncritical survey of all such schemes for each country, of necessity because the Working Party needs the f llest possible information in order to be able to come to an effective .judgement in selecting in the next stage of its work those schemes which it v/ould wish to recommend should be regarded as 'first on the list' for each country. The purpose of this paper is to suggest that before proceeding to this next stage of selection and recommendation, it would be most helpful to agree and lay down for the future guidance of the Working Party a set of basic principles which will govern the selection of projects and ensure a uniform and methodical treatment of each project. It is clear that many of those to be considered have been put forward on grounds of national prestige rather than economic necessity. Others may be technically possible of achievements, but economically unsound, at least for many years, or even decades, to come. It may well be that, when the actual decisions are taken on which projects shall be encouraged and which shall be left over, some concessions may have to be made to purely political considerations. But it will serve to avoid confusion if in the first instance the Working Party's selections and 'orders of priority' are based on purely economic considerations. Only in this v/ay will it be possible later to come to an effective judgement of the true economic cost of such concessions. This does not mean that the pressing need for the resettlement of the Arab refugees should be ignored, but in proceeding as suggested the working party may well find that such schemes can be made conveniently to fit in with projects which they are otherwise able to recommend. Indeed, there is much to be said for the thesis that schemes which are economically the soundest are those best suited to meet the problem and to furnish a permanent and ultimately self-supporting solution independent of further international aid. 2. The need for criteria The Colonial Development Working Party, in its Report, set out what it considered to be the broad objectives of economic policy in the Colonies and the criteria to be applied in selecting projects. Their recommendations were endorsed by Ministers, and should, it is suggested, form a. useful basis, mutatis mutandis, on which the pr sent Working Party can found its future work. Whilst not all the considerations affecting the recommendations of the C.D.W.P. apply in the present context, because of the difference in our relationship with the Middle East countries, the general problem remains the same; the broad objectives may therefore be stated as:- (i)/( p -0 Restore and improve the capital equipment of the Middle East countries so as to provide a firm basis for future development (ii) to promote those types of economic activity, whetfywsr primary or industrial, in which these countries aro best fitted to engage, having regard to the balance of their economies and the advantage of external trade; (iii) to raise living standards as rapidly as levels of productivity permit; (iv) to secure the maximum mutual advantage of the U.K. and the Middle East, having regard to any assistance, both material and technical, which the U.K. may be able to provide. Similarly, the criteria governing the selection of projects should be:- (a) that the proposed development should be a paying proposition, and will continue to be; (b) that in present circumstances those projects which yield an early return are to be proferred' in particular those which assist in providing an early solution to the problem of refugee settlement. 3. Investment Programmes. It is suggested that the first aim should be to draw up an unphased' Investment Programme for each country, i.e. arranging projects selected by reference to the above criteria in order of priority without reference to the time period over v/hich they will have to be spread. The Working' Party should then proceed to make an estimate of the resources available from all sources to each country, and the rate at which their own programmes could be carried into effect. The next step woulr* then be to determine the extent to which it would be desirable to facilitate speedier completion by means of U.K. assistance, having regard to what the U.K. can afford. Obviously, we cannot reasonably e,.pect one Middle East Government to accord priority to the projects of another if it can carry out a particular proposal from its own resources. The most effective way, therefore, of securing 'priority” as between the projects of one Middle East country and another, where this is considered desirable, will be by deploying* those additional resources v/hich. the U,K• can afford to make available so as to further this object. It is particularly important to avoi considering, country by country, what assistance from the U.K. is desirable, and indeed for v/hich a very strong case could be made out if each country were to be dealt with in isolation, only to find that, on adding it all up, the total is far oeyond v/hat the U.K. can provide. 4• What the U.K. can afford . The assistance which the Middle East countries will require can be divided.into three main categories, skill materials, and finance. (a) The term 'skill is here used to cover such things as advice, technical assistance, provision of expo ts, etc./- 3 - otc• This is the type of aid that will resent least difficulty to the TJ,K«, but even hero there are limits. Obviously the extent to which such demands compete v/ith the demands of our own Colonial Territories will have to be kept constantly in mind. Where there is a direct conflict of interests, the case for giving precedence to a Middle Hast projects will have to be a strong one, (b) There will no doubt be some scope for material assistance which takes the form of facilitating the provision of scarce materials and equipment against payment, but here again there will bo the competing claims of other export markets and developments, (c) The Report of the Investment Programmes Commi tee estimates that there will be about 5100 millions net available for overseas in 1932. The bulk of this, if not all, will be required for investment in the Colonies or the rest of the Sterling Area. But the basis on which this figure is computed permits a wide margin of error in which a sum of the order of (say) £20- £25 million net would bo easily swallowed up. Such a sum judiciously deployed may be of very great help to the Middle East. At the same time it is clear that, whilst the Working Party need not take a completely defeatist attitude towards the possibility of U.K. help in this direction, any case for a loan will again have to be particularly strong. It must be remembered that such assistance adds to the bur den of unrequited exports, as does the more rapid running down of sterling balances; materials and equipment provided against such monies are not 'paid for' in the sense intended in (b) above.MTr.nT.ff. y.A 3 'P (OFFICIAL) V.ORKING PARTY .

Its 'boundaries on • the western side have not, of course, yet been agreed, but it raay be estimated that the population of the new State will amount to about 800,000 excluding the 500,000 refugees who are at present established in it. To ensure the stability and prosperity of this new State must be for some time to come a cardinal factor- of our foreign policy in the Middle East. Transjordan itself is, however, still in a state of primitive rural economy and its standard of living is low, particularly . in comparison with the standard of living enjoyed by Arab Palestine under the Mandatory Government. 2. The known economic resources of Greater Transjordan are slight. Her major assets are the extensive phosphate desposits near Amman in the north and Ma’an in the south, which have so far only been developed to an extremely limited degree, owing partly to transport difficulties and partly to lack of markets, and the Potash Works at the north end of the Dead Sea, which it is hoped will remain in Transjordan territory when the peace settlement with Israel is concluded but which .have been totally destroyed by Jewish and Arab action. There are’ limited agricultural development possibilities, involving irrigation works in the Jordan Valley and improvement of crop production in the hill lands of Arab Palestine. A subsidiary of the Iraq Petroleum Company is prospecting for oil but no deposits have so far been found. The broad conclusion has been reached by H.M. Minister at Amman and H.M. Consulate-General at Jerusalem that Greater Transjordan could become an economically viable state, but only at a low standard of living. This means, in fact, that the standard of living of Arab Palestine will have to be reduced to the level of that at present prevailing in Transjordan proper, and such a reduction will, in certain respects at least, be drastic. (It is estimated, for instance, that expenditure on public services such as health and education will have to be reduced by about 80$). This conclusion was reached without taking into account the burden imposed upon Transjordan by the necessity for absorbing at least a large / ‘' proportion of 500,000 refugees. (See II below). Unless, • therefore, some unexpected development occurs, such as the „ discovery of oil otf the sudden opening up of large markets for 1 her phosphates, it is likely to be many years before the new state will be able to earn a revenue sufficient to provide for a substantial rise in the cost of living. Meanwhile, financial assistance from outside sources i$ required for development projects (a) to make possible the resettlement of the Arab refugees, and (b) to enable the new state to become established on a sound economic basis. The political stability of Arab Palestine largely depends upon the progress which the Transjordan government can make in restoring some measure of economic prosperity. II. PRESENT FINANCIAL POSITION 3. Transjordan's present financial position is precarious. Her imports in 1947 were at the rate of million per annum (including £ 3 &gt; 300,000 for'the I.P.C. )»and in 1948 at £ll|r million (including £5V0 9 OQO for the I.P..C.) (The increase in 1948 ifl accounted 1 for by theinoods of Arab Palestine* and actually indicates a decrease in the imports of Transjordan itself). /Recorded Trans j ordan plCisRecorded exports and re-exports amounted in 1947 to £871,000, and in 1948 to £2i million but in add!ti cel there is a large un recorded re-export trade. Further assistance towards closing this between imports and exports is at present provided by:- (a) His Majesty’s Government’s subsidy to the Arab Legion which has been hitherto at the rate of £2 million per annum; (b) The assumption of responsibility for short-term relief for the refugees by the United Nations; • (c) Moreover, imports at this rate would not be possible were it not for releases of blocked sterling balances which are at' present accumlating in the banks at Amman as the result of the redemption of Palestine currency which has been imported into the country. Up to the end of March, 1949, &amp; total of £7i million will have been released, and releases are continuing from April onwards at the rate of £f million per month. There is at the moment about £5 million in hand. Up till the beginning of February redemptions kept pace with releases, but since that date they have begun to fall sharply. It therefore seems possible that not much more money will be available when the £5 million has been exhausted. 4* Meanwhile, in the areas of Arab Palestine which Trans jordan has absorbed the standard of living and of administration, is, inevitably, much lower than that which prevailed under the former Mandatory Government and approximates, in fact, to the standards which have hitherto prevailed in Transjordan. So far the inhabitants of Arab Palestine, have^ accepted the necessity for this and have co-operated reasonably well with the Transjordan authorities. The need which we had anticipated last autumn for urgent short-term financial -assistance to set the administration of this area on its feet - His Majesty’s Minister of Amman estimated that £!•§• million might he required for this purpose - did not materialise. The country is, hov/ever, extremely impoverished and miserable^ and unless the Transjordan Government can restore some raora werk of chmsxi’ prosperity serious political unrest may be expected. 5. As regards (a), however, we are anxious to promote conditions in which it will be possible to discontinue direct subsidies to the Arab Legion. Investment in the economic development of Transjordan should be a means of removing this recurrent burden from His Majesty’s Government. As regards (b) it is now generally agreed that only a small proportion of the refugees in Greater Transjordan are likely to be accepted back at their homes by the Government of Israel. It is, therefore, desirable that re-settlement should begin as soon as possible. The Transjordan Government are under stood to be willing in principle to absorb a largest proportion of these refugees into' Transjordan. The United Nations relief for the maintenance of the refugees in unlikely to last beyond the end of this year. 6, The United Nations Conciliation Commission is responsible for arranging resettlement of the refugees and it is hoped that it will succeed soon in working out plans. These plans will have to include the investigation of all possible sources of external financial assistance — e.g. the International Bank, private investments, direct government loans, etc..7* Meanwhile, in view of the extreme urgency both of stablising the internal economy and promoting refugee resett^ment, His Majesty’s Goyernment have made an interest-free loan of £l million to the Transjordan Government to enable it to undertake immediately certain short-term development and resettlement projects described in paragraph III (i) below:- Membership of International Bank 8* Transjordan is not yet a member of the International Bank, The Transjordan Government were not, in fact, until recently alive to its existence* Were they to apply for membership, His Majesty’s Government would have to make available, against sterling, the small quantity of gold required for their subscription, and to provide dollars to service and repay any dollar loan obtained. Ill THE POSSIBILITIES OF ECONOMIC DSVELOFMENT (I) SHORT-TERM PROJECTS * ' 9. Three short-term projects of a minor nature have already been worked out and are now about to be put in hand* These are: (a) Irrigation projects on 9 of the perennial streams running into the Jordan* One such project (on the Wadi el Arab) had been completed just before the laon referred to in paragraph II above was granted. In addition, there are two small schemes for irrigation by means of pumps, one at Azraq, using the water from springs situated there C1380 acres), the other on the left bank of the Jordan (1150 acres). 10. His Majesty’s Minister at Amman has estimated that all these schemes will cost £P 315,000. This sum includes only the cost of the headworks for the 9 perennial streams projects and of clearing the land at Azraq and on the left bank and generally making it fit for agriculture. It does not take into account resettlement costs. The intention is that, in the earlier stages at least, settlers would live in tents or under some other form of temporary shelter. About 25 dunums (5.75 acres) would be allotted to each family (5 persons). No draft animals would be required. 11. It is not yet possible to give a firm estimateif of the number of settlers for whom these schemes will provide. First estimates of from 20 - 30,000 are likely to prove very over- optimistic* (b) The resettlement of refugees on about 62,000 acres of rain-fed land in the Ma’an area* The intention is to settle the largest possible number of families, and it is thought that a l ot viable ♦f about 57 acres per family will be sufficient. If, as is hoped, 1350 families can thus be provided for, at a cost of’£P 500 per family (to cover the purchase of a house, aa underground cistern, implements, seeds, ploughing animals and a few sheep), the scheme would provide for about 6750 settlers at a total cost of about £P 675*000.12, One of the problems vrtiich is likely to arise is the settlement of claims by certain tribes to the land in question ar^ allowance will have to be made for the purchase of grazing rights. (c) The construction of water-holes for sheep in grazing areas, by means of which it is hoped to double the sheep population of Transjordan. 13# Costs are difficult to estimate since each water-hole must be designed to fit the wadi in which it is built, ‘The average cost of each water-hole might however be £P 550. The construction unit comprising a bull-dozer, etc., would cost about £P 8000 and interest on the capital expenditure on this item,‘plus‘loss on resale, would have to be taken into account. Water-holes could be constructed at the rate of about 20 per year, with a single construction unit. The balance of the £ 1 million loan would cover the construction of 17 or 18 holes. (2) COMMUNICATIONS 14. Transjordan’s only port is Aqaba, some 240 miles from Amman. Port facilities are very undeveloped chiefly because communications with the interior are too difficult to make it worth using. There is a metalled road from Aqaba to the top of the escarpment 40 miles away which was built by the British army during the late war. It needs extensive repairs in place s ^ where sudden torrents have washed it away. 0o-t.n. 3stimateZ^- F that it could be restored for £ 46,000. It is also estimated that the earth track from the top of the escarpment (Naqb Ashtar) to Amman could be made into a good fair-weather track for £ 34,000. 15. Once these road improvements were completed it is believed that Aqaba might become of some economic importance to Transjordan and attract a number of permanent settlers. 16. Dredging at a cost of £10,000 is required at Aqaba Port itself. 17. The Railway from Naqb Ashtar to Amman is now working and improvements are being made gradually by the Transjordan Government. The road will however be necessary to supplement the Railway especially in the event of military operations. • 18. The Railway to Damascus and Beirut is in operation and has been one of the main lines of supply for Transjordan since the railway to Haifa was cut. by Jewish terrorists who blew up the Hammeh Bridge over the Yarmuk River in 1947. 19. Under the Annex to the Anglo-Trans jordan Treaty the Trangjatdan Government can call on His Majesty’s Government to assist in maintaining and developing lines of communication in and across Transjordan which are required for purposes of mutual defence. This covers the section of the Haifa-Bagdad road from Mafraq eastwards to the Iraqi frontier and consideration is being given to the question of financial assistance for the maintenance of this road. • • ■ 20. The cost of maintaining the metalled road in Eastern Palestine in addition to those already existing in Transjordan will be considerable, but no precise estimate is available.(3) JORDAN-YARMUK CANALISATION PROJECT (i) De8criT)tion of Project 21, Mr. M.G. lonidos, formerly Development Officer to the Mandatory Government of Transjordan, prepared a report on the water resources of Transjordan and their development in 193o and recommended that a major irrigation project, involving the canalisation of the waters of the Jordan and the Yarmuk, was practicable. Mr. G. Walpole, the present Director of Surveys in Transjordan, has prepared a rough estimate of the cost of this Scheme and the numbers who might be settled as a result of it. Mr.-Walpole assumes intensive cultivation would be developed as a result of the project and that all the owned land in the Jordan Valley would be purchased from its present owners and redistributed as holdings of 25 dunums (5.75 acres; per family on cultivation leases. Half the mean annual discharge of the Jordan and Yarmuk rivers would be utilised for the full development of the project. On this basis Mr. Walpole estimates that the project could provide for the settlement of 8,000 families (about 40,000 individuals). He estimates the total cost as follows: Cost of expropriation Canalisation of the Jordan and Yarmuk Diversion of the Yarmuk winter floods into Lake Tiberias for * use in the Summer Housing of 8,000 families at £300 per house Purchase of implements and ploughing animals at £100 per family Anti-Malaria work Unforeseen expenditure £ 1 , 891,600 7 , 500,000 500,000 2 , 400,000 800,000 50,000 250,000 Total £13,391,600 22. Mr. Walpole points out that the Jordan Valley is climatically particularly well situatedfor the production of special crops (vegetables and fruit) which can be placed on the market much earlier than similar crops grown elsewhere and therefore bring in higher prices. If such crops are developed in the Jordan Valley it should be possible to charge cultivators there higher mSsS than are paid elsewhere. He recommends that the loan or loans which will be required to finance the project should be raised on the security of the land and repaid from the revenue that will accrue from the cultivators* rents. He estimates that the annual revenue from rent might amount to £ 750,000 while the annual cost of maintenance might be about £250,000, thus leaving &amp;n annual balance for payment of interest and annual payments into a sinking fund of £500,000. On this basis, it would take the Transjordan Government some thirty years to repay the loan. Mr. Walpole recommends that an Authority should be set up to administer the project. The Authority would lay down crop policy and market the produce. The Chancery at Amman have /now..„now have asked to consult Mr* Walpole and comment ont (a) Numbers of ancillary wiitwrft- which could be absorbed in addition to the 8 # 000 cultivators; (b) Numbers of existing cultivators who will be expropriated. (c) Likelihood that the Transjordan Government will be willing to expropriate and to impose the high rents suggested. (d) The constitution and functions of the proposed Authority, (ii) Appointment of an irrigation survey* 23* Meanwhile, the Transjordan Government have decided to appoint the British engineering firm of Sir Murdoch MacDonald and Partners to'prepare a preliminary survey of constructional works for this project. This will take three months and cost about £5,500 to £6,000. The firm could then,be further engaged for the preparation of detailed designs and estimates and subsequently as contractors for the works. Before any action can be taken by Transjordan on this project, however, it will be necessary for her first to reach an agreement in principle with the Government of Israel regarding the use of the waters of these rivers, for since the Israeli frontier runs for some distance down the centres of the rivers the waters belong equally to both States. Agreements with Syria and the Lebanon will probably also be necessary, since the head waters of the Jordan are in both countries and the Yarmuk has its source in Syria. (iii) leraeli irrigation development project 24. The Transjordan Government’s announcement of their intention to carry out a survey of the project has in fact provoked an immediate hostile reaction from Israel, where it is considered that the whole idea is a British plot to forestall Jewish initiative in developing the area in question. The Israeli Government is, moreover, understood to be now considering the implementation of the 'Hays-Savage' Scheme, which provides for the(iv) i ^ r i? atlon som0 600,000 acres in Palestine by the use 0 the waters of the Jordan. It is known that this scheme was drawn up without consultation with either the Palestine or Transjordan Governments. It is not clear, from such ^ information about it as is available here, whether its implementation would necessarily deprive Transjordan of what might be considered her fair share of water - i.e. half the annual discharge of the Jordan and the Yarmuk. Since, moreover, the full development of the scheme involves the construction of a dam in Syria, and the use of the waters 01 the Litani river in the Lebanon for hydro-electric power, tlle v* a w? e0 ? Qr1 ^ Syrian and Lebanese Government will pro ably have to be sought before it can bo implemented, it is understood that no detailed surveys of works for the scheme have yet been made, . “ 0 f Q0VOI, » although tha actual canalization schemas for the two countries will necessarily be separate and distinct, it seems certain that the irrigation development at certain °°“ n * rias 5 111 require joint operational control at certain points. Per example the regulation of the ?ntnS®»t at £ h K ^ tlet £ rom the 3 °a of Galilee will affect the o f ° ountrlas ; and at the point in the upper Hays cana l would take its supply westwards . J oas 'paI Plain are as 1 will have to be made for inter se ? s02 ? al flow of water in accordance with the interest of Transjordan, as well as Israel, The joint interests of the two countries would also be involved if it t0 ™ akea Aversion from the Yarmuk into the sea er Galilt-e for the storage of the rivers flood waters* such a ben^fft 0n i WOl;1 ^ pass through into Israeli territory and the ^?act both countries.

Since the plant has never supplied Transjordan, and since Israel .is now obtaining almost all its electricity by other means, negotiations on this matter are unlikely to present difficulty except from the point of view of the private interests involved. (4) MEAT CANNING PACTORY 28. , Before the disastrous drought of 1947, Transjordan had' a considerable export surplus of sheep, and if the project for constructing water-holes referred to in paragraph III (1) (c) above is undertaken it should be possible to restore this surplus with reasonable speed. The possibilities of improving the quality of the pasturage in Transjordan might also usefully be investigated by the Forestry and soil Conservation Adviser to the B.M.E.O, It is understood that a meat canning factory in the Middle East might be a paying proposition if a through-put of 40,000 animals per annum were attained. This figure is considered to be beyond the capacity of Transjordan alone but the B.M.E.O. have suggested that a meat canning factory might be set up at Damascus which would draw on supplies of sheep from Syria and northern Iraq, as well as from Transjordan.- The output of this factory would almost certainly find a ready market in neighbouring Arab states. 29. This proposal has now been discussed by the Ministry of Food with the Overseas Food Corporation. The latter have suggested that a commercial firm such-as Liebigs might be interested in the scheme, particularly if government assistance in the form of a guarantee could be offered. If no commercial interest can be aroused, the Corporation would be willing to consider the project themselves at a later stage, when more information is available, from the point of view of exports to the United Kingdom. 30. The Head of the Development Division of the B.M.E.O. proposes, on his next visit to. Syria, to examine the question of sheep prices. If these prove not to be exorbitant, the question of arranging for a visit of investigation by a commercial meat canning expert will be examined. 5. AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMEM' 31. A considerable market exists in the Levant States and Israel for cereals, grapes, olives and olive oil and vegetables produced in Transjordan and Arab Palestine. It is likely that there are numerous small ways in which greater Transjordan could be assisted to expand her production of these crops.32# The Agricultural Adviser to the B.M.B.O. is therefore arranging to visit Greater Transjordan shortly to survey the technical measures required to promote the developmont of agricultural production. 6. FISH5RI5S 33. It is considered that the fisheries at Aqaba could be considerably expanded if road communications between Amman and Aqaba could be imx^roved. An expanding market for this fish at present exists in Transjordan itself and in Israel. Certain small capital expenditure on the provision . of a collecting ship and refrigerated lorries might be equired. It is considered likely that Transjordan could provide this herself. I*. PHOSPHATES 34. Transjordan possesses extensive phosphate deposits, reported to be of high grade quality. Hitherto these have beenleai««&amp; on an extremely limited scale by a small Transjordan Company and exported to neighbouring states. Attempts made in 194 z 7 to secure. British participation in the Company proved unsuccessful. Nor have His Majesty f s Government felt able to take any active steps to promote this production in view of the lack at present (according to our information) of- any large scale markets for Transjordan phosphates either in Europe, East Africa or Asia# Certain Italian commercial interests have, however, now decided to undertake this development# The Transjordan Company has been reconstituted with six Italian and five Transjordan directors, a nominal_capital of £ 1 ^ million and a paid up capital of £660,000 in which the Italians have a controlling interest. The Transjordan Government has granted a thirty- year concession 4 to the. Company f or the development of all * the deposits in the country. Under the terms of the concession, the Government will receive royalties but no share in-the Company’s profits. 35* A British engineer who surveyed the mines in 1946 to 1947 estimated that a maximum of 300,000 tons per annum might be produced from thp Roseifa mines near Amman if £700,000 were spent on development, and a maximum of 900,000 tons per annum from the El-Hasa mines near Ma*an if £3#000,000 were spent on development. The natural outlet ' for the former mines would be northwards by the Hojaz railway and for the latter southwards via the gulf of Aqaba. The Company are at present planning to export northwards, mainly to Italy but also to Syria, the Lebanon, and possibly Israel. They estimate that the railway could transport 600,000 tons annually if additional rolling stock were provided. Later on the Company hope to export to the east, to India, Pakistan and Persia, and develop the Port of Aqaba-for this purpose. 36. No definite information is available regarding the Company s specific plans for expanding production; the methods by which this is to be financed and the equipment required. Tbe Comoany’8,legal adviser*, in -a recent'. 6-Oiivereat.ion-wi^ta the Foreign Office stated that the Company hope to procure a considerable proportion42. proportion of their equipment, including railway wagons, in Italy but that some equipment will certainly be required from this country and/or the United States* He promised to furnish a list of this equipment. He also said that the Company are hoping to finance the purchase of equipment from sterling or dollar sources by means of an International Bank loan. 37# The Company are endeavouring to obtain the participation of British interests and have approached the firm Selection Trust Limited. 38 . They are also now negotiating with the Lebanese Government for permission to establish a super phosphate plant at Beirut with an eventual output of 300,000 tons per annum. His Majesty^ Minister at Beirut considers that the realisation of this scheme which would involve an important expansion of trade between Lebanon, Transjordan and Syria might have far-reaching effects both politically and economically. Unfortunately, however, it has not proved possible so far to interest British firms in it. The alternative route through Haifa, while cheaper than the Beirut route, will involve a political agreement between the Transjordan and Israeli Governments and the rebuilding of the demolished Jordan bridge. 8 . POTASH : 39. Before the Palestine war, Transjordan obtained an annual revenue of about £ 75*000 from royalties paid by the Palestine Potash Company Limited (registered in the United Kingdom). 40. The northern Dead Sea works have been completely destroyed but the southern works which remained throughout the recent fighting in Israeli occupation are intact. ffho■ northern works -whi-eh- nocou-n-tod for rather more than half the t-otal -production, may bo-^-xpooted-to r^m-ai-n-4-B-J-fH»ao li territ-ory^, —but we— are nnxioa -3 that Trans-jo rdan should -obtain the fullest.,..possible bo-nof-i-t from the-oouthern: works 1 ; The Company are anxious to resume production at the southern works as soon as possible, but'this depends on fin adequate supply of fresh water which is only obtainable at the moment from Transjordan territory. It seems unlikely that the Transjordan Government will agree to discuss this or the general question of Palestine Potash Limited continuing to have a monopoly of the potash extraction rights in the Dead Sea before a fin^tl settlement has been negotiated with Israel. 41. The Palestine Potash Company Limited, though British registered, acts as a purely Israeli company and is so regarded by .the Transjordan Government. It has already been agreed interdepartmentally that we should not encourage the formation of a rival potash company in Transjordan and that, in due course, wo should advise the Transjordan Government in favour of amendment of the existing concession rather than cancellation. It has consequently been agreed that while we should not press the company to resume operations in Transjordan we should not discourage them. We wish to prevent the company fig quiring a position of economic domination in Transjordan but we hope to secure some financial advantage for Transjordan from cooperation with the Company.IV HEALTH SERVICES 42. An appreciation of the present situation regarding the Health Services in Arab Palestine has recently been received from Dr, Lloyd Williams, medical officer to the Consulate- General at Jerusalem. The picture which Dr. Lloyd Williams paints is grim. He has pointed out that under the Mandate the budget allocation of the Government Health Service was £ 1,100,000 for the year 1947 to 1948. The Jews probably contributed about 68^ of the cost of this service in the form of taxation but since they also maintained their own health service, the Arabs derived the main benefit. All the main government hospitals which existed under the Mandate and most of the voluntary hospitals are now in Jewish hands and for the population of Arab Palestine, estimated at about 625,000, there are at present available only 400 beds. The main Government laboratories producing vaccines, sera, etc. are also in Israel and there is only one place in Arab Palestine where X-rays can be taken.. 43. It is pointed out that the low incidence of malaria in Palestine was due to the intensive Public Health measures under the Mandate and that if these cannot be maintained there is a danger that malaria will quickly again begin to take an enormous toll of life. 44. Dr, Williams therefore urges that the Transjordan Government should realise their responsibility for this urgent and important problem and should insist in their negotiations ' with the Jews that a fair proportion of medical equipment and certain laboratories and hospitals should be handed over to them. His Majesty^ Minister at Amman has accordingly advised the Transjordan Government to seek the assistance of the World Health Organisation on the improvement of health services in Arab Palestine generally and to take up with the Israeli authorities the question of an equitable allocation of the medical assets of Palestine. The Transjordan Government’s attitude is, however, so defeatist that they are unwilling to take any initiative. V APPOINTMENT OF TECHNICAL EXPERTS 45* The Transjordan Government at present employs the following foreign experts: Director of Land Surveys (Mr. G.P. Walpole, British) Exchange Controller (Colonel P.A. Kendrick, British) Chief Curator of Antiquities- (Mr. G.W.L. a Harding, British) Irrigation Exj^ert (Mr. P.N. Simanski - White Russians with Sudanese passport) 46. His Majesty’s Minister at Amman, His Majesty’s Consul- General at Jerusalem and tho B.M.E.O. have been consulted regarding the desirability of urging the Transjordan Government to employ more British experts with particular reference to their new responsibilities in Arab Palestine. 47. His Majesty’s Minister at .-mman considers that the appointment of a British Director of Customs would be desirable but that it would be inadvisable to press this point now. /Apart...Apart from this post, they have unanimously recommended that there is no further requirement at present for fl. whole-time British experts in specialised subjects and that Transjordan*s ne^.s could be met by ad hoc visits of experts in specialised fields from the British Middle East Office and other sources. Terms of Service 48. The gross salaries earned by the experts listed above do not in any case exceed £1,800 per annum. His Majesty*s Legation at Amman consider that these salaries are inadequate to meet the cost of living in Transjordan, particularly in view of the exorbitantly high cost of accommodation. They therefore recommend that, when the time comes to recruit replacements for these officers, consideration should be given to subsidising the posts in the form of rent allowances. VI DEVELOPMENT BOARD 49. We are suggesting to the Transjordan Government that they should set up a small development board which might have a majority of Arab members o# which the Director of Land Surveys, and if possible, also the Exchange Controller would be members, and which would possess an .independent budget. The loan of £ 1 million which we are making to Transjordan and any Development Loans subsequently received from othtr sources would be paid to the Board who would be responsible for supervising the execution of the projects. VII TARGETS FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT 50 In Section II above, the present position regarding development plans and possibilities in Transjordan and the means available to carry them out has been surveyed. As a result of this survey the targets for further development may be summarised as follows:- (i) The establishment of a development board (ii) Implementation of short term projects. (see paragraph III (l) above) (iii) Communications (a) To press ahead with the improvement of the Amman Aqaba road. (b) To dredge the Port of Aqaba (c) To maintain and improve the section of the Haifa Bagdad road from Mafraq to the Iraqi frontier and the roads of Arab Palestine Jordan-Yarmuk Canalisation Project The suggested plan of action to be pursued by the Transjordan Government is as followe:- (1) To carry out the proposed preliminary engineering survey of the construction works for the major canalisation project as rapidly os possible; (2) As soon as the survey is ready, and as the political situation-permits, to take the initiative in inviting the Governments of Israel, Syria and the Lebanon to a conference to prepare a convention for the allocation of the waters of the Jordan and the Yarmuk, Transjordan’s claim being based on /the waters.../(viii).... the waters needed for the works referred to at (l), and supported by the importance of resettling the Arab refugees. At this conference the question of the cancellation of the Rutenberg concession and of an agreement for joint operational control ofV certain works could also be considered. (3) As soon as her entitlement of water is assured, to apply for an International Bank loan for the financing of the canalisation project, (it is hoped that direct assistance will also be forthcoming from the United States Government, and from Israel in the form of compensation paid to the Arab refugees). (4) To embark, as soon as possible, on the carrying out of the works. (3) Meanwhile, to set up .an Authority eir the Jordan Valley to administer the land redistributed and resettled as a result of minor irrigation schemes^ on the perennial streams (see paragraph III above). This Authority would be a national corporation. (Once the Convention referred to in ( 2 ) above is approved it would probably be preferable, at any rate at first, that development of the Jordan valley* should take place on national rather than international lines, # since the proposals which have been some what vaguely put forward by Israel for a Jordan Valley Authority involving the participation of Trans jordan, Israel, Syria, the Lebanon and possible other interested powers, might result in undue Israeli economic penetration into Transjordan.) (iv) Meat Canning Factory at Damascus This project will be further examined by the Head of the Development Division of the B.M.E.O. (v) Agricultural Development Arrangements have been made for the Agricultural Adviser to the B.M.E-O. to carry out a survey as soon as possible of agricultural development possibilities in Greater Transjordan. (vi) Fisheries The Transjordan Government should undertake the development of the Aqaba Fisheries. (vli) Phosphates (a) The Transjordan Government should consider the desirability of revising the terms of the concession granted to the Italian Companyj in order to ensure that it gets a share of the Company*s profits^and that the level of royalties paid is such as to provide the Government with a substantial revenue from the development of v;hat is probably the country’s major economic asset. (b) Every reasonable encouragement and assistance should be given 0 to the newly formed Italian-Transjordan Phosphate Company and in particular the possibility of arranging transport of phosphates via Beirut should be explored, as soon as possible.The Palestine Potash Company should he encouraged, as soon asr^ssihle, to resume operation of the Potash Works at the southern and of the Dead Sea end on terms which will allow the maximum possible income to accrue to the Transjordan Government. (ix) Health Services in Arab Palestine The Transjordan Government should (a) insist in the peace negotiations with the Israeli Authorities on the retention in Arab Palestine of certain medical institutions and equipment belonging to the former Mandatory Government and (b) invoke the assistance of the World Health Organisation to rebuild the shattered health services of Arab Palestine. (x) Appointment of Technical Experts (a) A British Director of Customs should be appointed in due course. VIIT RECOMMENDATIONS 1. As stated in Part I, to ensure the stability and prosperity of Greater Transjordan must be for some time to come~ a cardinal factor of our foreign policy in the Middle East. 2. The conclusion emerges from Part II that the financial assistance which we have so far given to Transjordan (i.e. the annual subsidy of £ 2 million to the Arab Legion plus the recent £ 1 million loan for development) will probably have to be continued, and possibly increased, for the next few years at least, if the objective in (l) above is to be achieved. Meanwhile we should watch the situation very closely and take all possible steps to ensure that the assistance already given is used to the best advantage. We should in particular ensure the establishment of the Development Board described in paragraph 3. Such further assistance as it proves necessary for His Majesty* s Government to give should, as far as possible, . take the.form of loans for development. We should seek thereby to enable Transjordan to increase her revenue-earning capacity so that she can in due course assume financial responsibility herself for the Arab Legion. 4. The outstanding development possibilities are: (a) Communications (see Part III(2)). (b) Jordan-Yarmuk canalisation project (see Part 111(3)). (c) Phosphates (See Part III (4)) (d) Potash (see Part III (8)). Communicaticns . His Majesty* s Government should make a special grant to meet the cost of the projects described in Party* III (2).6. International Bank It is possible that the International Bank might be prepared in due course to grant loans for the carrying out of the Jordan*-^ Yarmuk project and the development of Transjordan phosphates, r We should, therefore, suggest to the Transjordan Government that they might make informal contact with the Bank at this stage to explore the ground and obtain the Bank* s reactions to these projects, Jordan-Yarmuk -project . When the stage is reached for the works on the Jordan- Yarmuk project to be put in hand, we should give a high priority to the provision of the capital equipment required for this project from this country. 8. Phosphates We should watch closely the progress of the Italians in their plans for the development of Transjordan phosphates. As ’soon as we are convinced that these plans are soundwe shouldtake such steps as we can to assist the Company both in the mining project^ qixU in the proposed super phosphate plant at Beirut, s.g* by making available the equipment that they require and permitting British commercial interests to participate, if they wish to do so. 9, Potash We should seek to ensure that the Palestine Potash Company resumes operations in Transjordan on terms advantageous to the Transjordan Government, 10, Health Services Since the Transjordan Government are unwilling to take action themselves to remedy the g3?ave plight into v/hich the health services in Arab Palestine have fallen, we should take the initiative in drawing the attention of the Conciliation Commission and of the V/or Id Health Organisation to this situation. We should urge the World Health Organisation to give material assistance, and the Conciliation Commission to intervene with the Israeli Authorities in order to ensure that a fair proportion of the medical assets of the former mandatory government is allocated to Transjordan. 11. Technical Experts When the four British experts at present employed by the^ Transjordan Government come to be replaced, or when further appointments are made, we should consider the possibility of subsidising their salaries In the form of rent allowances.— x* 6.

Addressed to the Foreign Office telegram No.A 60 of May 20th repeated saving for information to B.M.E.O, My telegram No. 373: Iraq Petroleum Company negotiations. Wheatley has sent a message to Nuri Pasha that the meeting convened for consideration of his proposals hy shareholding groups has been unavoidably postponed until May 26th and that he hopes to give Nuri Pasha a definite reply soon after that date or, failing that, proposes a date for Nuri Pasha's visit to London, if such a visit is practicable to him. 2. According to the Company's representative Nuri Pasha was clearly disappointed by this message, but he seemed to derive some comfort from the use of the word definite. He said he would now join the Regent in northern Iraq and expects the reply towards the end of this month. 3. I told Mr. Wheatley before he left Bagdad that I thought it would be a mistake for Nuri Pasha to go to London unless details of agreement were practically settled beforehand. I still think so. Moreover, al though Wheatley told me he had made it absolutely clear to Muri Pasha that no money would be forthcoming until oil was flowing again to Haifa, I have no doubt Nuri Pasha does not take this as the last word and that he expects to conclude an agreement v/hich will not only fix new rates of royalty operative at once but also provide some immediate benefit to Iraq either in the form of an advance of royalties payable immediately at increased rates or a loan. I cannot, believe that Nuri Pasha, in view of his public statements, will be able to execute a complete Volte Face on Haifa at this stage when little progress is being made towards a final settlement in Palestine. He re-stated his views on Haifa to me as late as May 16th. 4.

MIDDLE EAST (OFFICIAL) COMMITTEE WORKING PARTY ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST MIDDLE EAST OIL INDEXES The Middle East is an increasingly important source of* supply of crude petroleum and refined products to the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth and the countries participating in the European Recovery Programme. In addition, sales for hard currencies are a most valuable contribution to the economy of the United Kingdom. 2, There are three outstanding features in the Middle East oil situation: (A) The vastly expanded importance to the world economy of the Middle East where over half the world* s' proved oil reserve are located, which supplies 12$ of world production and which is expected to supply 25$ by 1956. (B) The ^ anticipated three-fold rise by 1956 in Middle East oil production which has already risen three-fold in the past decade. (C) The large interest of British companies (and His Majesty’s Government which has a controlling interest in the Angjo- Iranian Oil Company) producing over two-thirds.of total Middle East output, 3. The^following table (illustrated in Diagram A) shows how the Middle East is.expected to provide a greater proportion of the total world increase of production than any other oil-bearing region: Estimated World Production of Crude Oil (million tons) . 19U8 1251 1956 Middle East 56.5 100.7 154.5 U.S.S.R. 29.0 36.5 47.0 Central and South America 92.0 108.6 110.4 U.S.A. 292.8 284.0 280.0 Others 17.2 25.1 Total 487.5 549.3 617.0 /4. • *i* ■ ‘. rf * wsgim ' .

(b) Iraq reserves are to be opened up by new pipelines and will be nearly 10 times greater in the next decade. (c) Iran, hitherto the leading producer, is overshadowed by the expansion in the Arabian fields. (d) The phenomenal rise in Kuwait output which by 1951 shares second place among producing countries. Estimated Oil Production (million tons )• 1948 1251 1256 Iran 24.5 32.0 42.0 Iraq 3.5 13.5 30.0 Saudi Arabia 19.0 25.0 38.0 Bahrein 1.5 1.5 1.5 Kuwait 6.2 24.0 36.0 Egypt 1.8 2.7 3.0 Qatar - 2.0 4.0 Total 56.5 100.7 154.5 6 . A direct result of this spectacular rise in production will be greatly increased royalty payments to Middle Eastern governments. The estimates which follow are calculated on the present rates of royalties plus all other payments. As a result of current negotiations royalty payments in a number of countries may be considerably increased, a lOOyb increase for Iran being not'improbable. Diagram D illustrates these estimates:— /Estimated... iEstimated Royalty Receipts (£ million sterling) 12 kz 12M .1951 1256 Iran 7.1 9.0 11.4 14.5' Iraq 1.9 1.5 5.7 12.8 Saudi Arabia 7.0 11.4 15.0 22.8 Kuwait 0.5 1.5 5.9 8.8 Egypt 0.6 1.1 1.6 1.8 Qatar - — 0.5 0.9 Bahrein 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.4 7* British interests have until recently been far larger than those of other countries but the exploitation of the rich Arabian deposits by American companies and the expansion of Iraq, output in which two American companies share with British and French interests, is bringing non-British (predominantly United States) interests into an almost equal proportion# Estimated Middle East Production by Controlling Interests #. 12M 12U (Million tons) 1256 Btitish 31.2 54.5 80.4 United States 24.55 42.7 66.55 Other 0.75 3.5 7.55 56.5 100.7 154.5 8.

Within three years, Middle Eastern oil is expected to supply over four-fifths of Western Europe’s oil needs, leaving Western Hemisphere oil to be consumed within that hemisphere# ? The^remainder of Middle East production will be used locally in Africa and the Far East where its importance for Commonwealth countries will be increasingly substantial. Any deficiency in production in the Western Hemisphere will undoubtedly be made good by imports from the Middle East.Capital Development 10. The Table at Annex P sets out the approved projects by British Oil Companies in the Middle East, together with estimated costs based on the latest information available. The sterling expenditure includes erection and other local costs some of which will be in local currencies. The dollar costs are for equipment from the United States, consisting mainly of large-diameter line pipe and specialised refinery and drilling equipment, including technical services and design fees.

As railways will he a most important aspect of development it appears undesirable that railway development should be completely divorced from the Board. It seems to us that while the railways should continue to administer their own running and maintenance budget, money for extensions and capital works should be allotted to them by the Board. We can find nothing in the Railway Agreement which precludes this. 2. Such an arrangement should ensure that any expensive railway extensions are not made in areas v/hich might be efficiently served by cheaper roads and in general that railway expansion keeps pace with other development. 3* We also suggest that the same procedure mirht apply to Basra port. 4. One of the Beard s first actions might well be to invite a foreign ([.referrably British) Communications Commission to examine the various projects for airfields roads, railways, I.W.T. and port development and to recommend a co-ordinated programme of priorities for say a three year and a ten year period.

Copies of the record of the discussion with McCloy and Ilii'f referred to in my telegram under reference have now been forwarded by bag. 2. Neither McCloy nor Iliff had had the opportunity to give much thought to the Iraqi position, They^felt that the Bank would want to examine the various projects in more detail and to consider the recommendations among themselves before going into the question more fully with His Majesty's Government. We made it clear that we regarded the Haigh Commission projects as taking precedence over other schemes such as railway development, 3. Iliff emphasised that the Bank would as a sine qua non insist that the Iraqis should balance their budget. This point would be studied by the Mission which he hoped would be able to set out even earlier than June (assuming that the Bank first had the opportunity of examining^the Haigh Reports).

On point (1) Iliff, who negotiated the Iraqi sterling balance agreement in 1947, is of course well aware that sterling releases were provided on a generous scale in order to enable the Iraqis to undertake /their development' CONFIDEI'fnAL FOREIGN OFFICE TELE GPu-Jvl WO. i,2^ I'O B^GDiJ) - 2 - W their development programme and he v.lll require to he convinced that they are unable to put up the £3 million for the sterling portion’of the'.estimated external expenditure. In general we ourselves dislike the idea oi the Bank lending sterling to countries holdin-g substantial sterling^balances but we-would be prepared to look at the Iraqi position again in the event of the Bank experts coming to the conclusion that a sterling loan would be justified. 5. Point (2) raises a very important question but'it appeared that Iliff did not have in mind any such formal arrangements as Bayne contemplated with regard to the provision of dollars for -servicing and capital repayment' of any dollar loan. Iliff wished to consider this point further before discussing it more fully with us. 6. as regards point (3) while he did not entirely rule out the possibility of a limited loan for internal expenditure, Iliff said that the Bank would do all they could to induce the Iraqis to find their own resources all the finance required for local expenditure. He hoped that in the^event of the Bank agreeing to a loan to cover external expenditure sufficient confidence would be engendered locally to enable an internal loan to be raised. We of’course fully support the Bank*s view that an external loan for internal purposes is to be avoided if at all possible since it. cannot fail to have inflationary effects and that everything possible must be done to persuade the.Iraqis to find the dinars (amounting only to £6.8 million worth over a period of 3 years) required for the projects in question. 7. -as regards the draft Bill for the constitution of the Central Development Board, we have just seen Sir H. Mack’s letter to Mr, Wright of .npril 11th, a copy of which has been forwarded to Washington together with a paper containing Crawford's comments thereon. A copy of the latter has also been despatched to Bagdad.

There are many difficulties of ocurse to overcome, e.g. ooaojotiag rates in the basaar. Jobs at high wages in other parts of the gulf but requiring only little practical experience or eduoatio i. The oil co&amp;oeny have given some assistance to this Technical School In tho past but 1 suggest that at some convenient opportunity they should examine tho matter afresh and aee whether they can place funds, equipment and technical advice at tho disposal of the Qovomuent to enable a considerable expansion of the school's activities to bo effected for tho benefit of Bahrain as a whole.

Recommendations of salary reoi&amp;asification of Monthly rate and Daily Rate workers from one group to another require tho completion of a detailed report by a senior supervisor. There are also most detailed regular 'rating reports' on Rorsmen and Supervisors and others covering ten headings (initiative, leadership, etc.) with five subheadings', I gathered that these reports are prepared independently by fteur senior staff closely associated with each man^ e&gt; work.

It was unavoidable in the circumstances with which, they were faced. Recruiting through the Agents hod ceased.

Mr. Jordan realised the cost and risks of abuse of this method of obtaining daily labour but referred again to his difficul ties caused by shortage of staff. The matter was being Investigated as pert of the expansion and reorganisation of the administration and he had no doubt a suitable solution would be foundo I had to leave the matter there. PER SONNEL DEPARTMENT. 30 ft X was in close contact with the employees in this^ Department during my visit. With the exception of one (I£r. Corbett) all had less than 1 yeor*s service with the Company and none of them had had any previous practical experience of personnel work or industrial relations* The latter applied also to the Labour Officers at the various field centres* Nevertheless, I was impressed by their eagerness and general approach to their activities« But their newness is a severe handicap to the Company when labour problems of much complexity are arising. There were two strikes during my visit and I was able to give seme guidance regarding them. I spoke to Mr. Campbell (Asst. General Manager) and Mr. Jordan on the matter and they realised fully the position but referred again to the rapidity with which they had had to build up their st^ff and the difficulties of recruiting more experienced administrators and employees with long experience of industrial and human relationSo It is certainly a serious problem for the Company and it is to be hoped that no serious labour uoheaval will occur while the new employees are gaining knowledge of the work. X know Mr, Chisholm the Chief Personnel Manager of the Company in London and will have a talk with him during my forthcoming visit. It is easy to criticise but it Is not so easy to find solutions to the problems X have described in this reporto 31o Several less important features into which X enquired have not been mentioned but X hope X have described adequately the essential background of the position of Kuweit generally and the Oil Company’'s activities in particular (SGD) M.T, AUDSLKYOener Q^TAH Mte_e of ylslt - g7,l,49 to 3 Q. 1.49 Qatar le an ungainly peninsula on the Arabian ^luiand about 100 aiilea long and averaging 30 mile* In . alaoet vaterleag, vithoufc cultivation oi ^inu except i or a cioail area oT date trees near Dohnh and concieta largely of lav barren hills.

The only roads are those constructed or being constructed by the Oil Company The Oil Company - Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd!, a,subsidiary of the Iraq Petroleum Co, - hae its headquarter* at Dukhan on the west coast near which they have constructed a landing strip for their airoraft. Ihe Company have &amp; jetty at Z&amp;krit and are conirtruetinr oil-loading facilities at Unw Said on the East Ooagt south of Doheh. The present cll-oroducing wells are situated in the Dukhan area. There are no amenities Other than those provided by the Oil Company, There are no postal or telegraph facilities. The Sheikh rules personally and there ie no official administration, 1 do not know the sums., if any, the Sheikh has received by way of cash payments, nor the rat© of Royalty laid down in the Conceeeion agreement but ae no oil hao yet been exported,the total amount cannot be large. Export of crude oil in quantity is expected to start in 19S0. X gathered that nothing hae been done by the Sheikh regarding develops mente affecting the social life of his*small comounity Slavery exiet* and I was* told that there might be as many ae 250 local slave© employed by the Oil Company, and that they have to hand their earnings to their 'masters' who return such amounte as they decide usually about one third. It will be necessary to do something about this later on but it is a complex problem affecting Arabia generally and I am not competent to express any view® regarding it. *3' Pearl diving w&amp;a the main occupation of the Qataris before the Oil Company started. It is a pre carious weans of obtaining &amp; living. Most of tnem are always in debt to the owners of the pearl dhow^ and under an obligation to return to these oynei’e each naason, Some of the men employed by the Company leave temporarily for this reason, although t earning*© tt' e v X t efi ; ilan th ® Company* e wages, Sta cs shoved that the 1 turnover M of 'Qatari® wan very high in the months Ox July and Augunt 1948 compared with the other months of the year. OIL COMPANY covenanted ea mlayeea axsludlng O V £2 &amp; contractors • pmi Ae .at let January 1949, the staff consisted of Ov /,.« 145- 2 - 145 British; 16 American {all Drillers) anci 1 Swisft employees. In addition* thei'e were 3 British temporarily ati&amp;ohed; a total of 165♦ This compared with a total of 66 on the let January 1948, Further recruitment ie not contemplated during 1949. During the year 194a, 28 employees resigned or were termina ted and I was told that a high percentage of these elected to break their contracts before the eouipletio. of-the 11th month 1 e employment although thifi iTYvolved their paying the repatriation expenses. (Employees^who complete eleven months of employment are entitled to break their three years contracta (two years in the ease of the Amierlcane) at their option and to be re imbursed their repatriation expanses). One of the reasons given to me for this socsewhat surprising feature was that many of those recruited during the last 18 months - and very few have been employed in Qatar for longer than this period - had decided to secure employment overseas because of doaestic differ ence a and that &amp;$ these difference;,? had bean resolved, they had elected to return to the U 0 K. at whatever cost ,to themeelvef. 4 i was also interested in the statement that ?£# of ths new employees wsre married. In other areas of the Middle East, the percentage has been much lower. Only * , or.e or two' 5 were discharged during 1948 for personal ml ©behaviour. t&gt; 4 Having regard to the nature of the country and general'conditions In which the Company*8 opera tions are carried out, it ie reta&amp;rk&amp;ble that, such a very high standard of living baa been sa&amp;de available to the employees. Each has a fully-furnished room - some have bathrooms attached - in well constructed buildings; these rooms have separate air-cooling unite or a block is air-conditioned from &amp; single plant; the ©sals are varied, of high standard in substantial quantities - during say stay one dinner consisted of soup, fish; roast turkey, rice croquettes, peas,peach * aelba, coffee; there are facilities for laundry,read- ing, billiards; a fully equipped hospital and medical services are available and the staff includes 2 British doctors; cards, cricket, football, tennis,etc; electricity i« available everywhere. All these servicea are provided free by the Company. 6. It Is the normal practice of the Company to allow Home leave to accumulate at the rate of one week, for every 2 months of service to be taken after 2 years', employment in Qatar, but ae it is unlikely that the Company will be able to provide.for some time to come sufficient accommodation for their married employees, and In view of the unavoidable lack of amenitlee other than those mentioned above, the Company have given discretion to the Fields Manager to grant one month*» special leave to married sen after one yearns service who desire to visit their home©. The Company pay the expenses involved. This la a very commendable policy and goes a long way towards relieving the monotony of life '’em Qatar. ~ •7 1 The salaries and alio vs aces of the employees are based on the following conditions:-- ALLO WA NCES.

Tn consequence the Sheikh of Qatar refuses to permit Bahreini« to work on the renineula. This ban had two interesting results. The Bahreinis included in the above statement are confined entirely to the Ccmpfiny^ marine Department and work either on their bargee and launches or on the Jetty 4; Zak 2 ’it,an&amp; as such are not technically* employed* on the Peninsula* Also if a man arrives at an Eaploysent Office with a * foreign* pneaport or nationality papers e k .g, Muac&amp;tie, the Company can engage but If not, .and Bahreini© coiac within this category, he la asnt to the Sheikh's 'Government* Office for a *work permit* which Is in effect a Qatar Nationality document. &amp; good number of Bahreinis have secured these permits; how ia not known exactly t Iranian# are Gimilarly dealt with as most of them arrive without papers.

The question of the International Bank Loan for Iraq was discussed at a recent meeting here with Mr.MCl#y, the President of the International Bank, and Mr. IIiff-. 2. Mr. Iliff stated that the Bank had not yet received a formal application from the Iraq Government for a loan. The Bank could obviously not ta-ce any definite action until such an application was received. He said that he would look into this matter further nn his return to Washington and let us know what the next move should be. 3. With regard to the informal application so far made for a loan for the Haigh projects, Mr. Iliff said that the Bank’s engineers would want ft study the Haigh proposals in Washington and would probably be able to formulate definite views on them. This study would enable them to brief the technical mission which he hoped would then go out to Iraq in June. Mr. Iliff is, therefore, anxious to have copies of the Haigh reports so that the engineers can get to \ ork without delay. We have explained to him that we have ourselves only seen the reports confidentially and are not ina.position to transmit them officially to the Bank. I should therefore be grateful if you would advise the Iraqi Authorities to forward urgently to the Bank at Washington (if they have not already done so) copies of enclosures (a), (b) and (c) to your letter 194/7/4-9 of February 16th to Eastern Depart ment and of the enclosures to your letters No. 194-/12/4-9 of March 11th to Middle East Secretariat. 4. It is obviously most important that Mr. Haigh and the nucleus of his Commission should still be in Iraq when the Bank Mission visits the country. I hope that the Iraq Government in fact will now be prepared to prolong their contracts until February 1950. (See your letter No.101/1/49 9 ! . anuary 10 th and your telegram No. 74.)

We shall try to get this permission. Mr. Williams told us that working almost single- handed over a wide area, he had discovered copper ore of good quality in the Iraqi section of the mountain formation which runs from Turkey south-eastwards along Iraq’s north eastern frontier. The location of the deposits is roughly along a line from Penjwin, in the south-east of the range north-westwards to Choarta, Qal*eh Dizeh Rowanduz. Some of the deposits contain as much as 40^ of copper. Williams thinks that it would he a paying proposition to work it, hut that it would have to he done scientifically and v/ith heavy financial hacking for building a railway line and so on. He thinks that London mining interests would he charry of investing at present in mines so near the Russian hord.er. He has written to friends in London about the discovery. Other minerals he found were chrome iron, nickel and manganese. He also mentioned indications of possible uranium deposits. He is going north again this summer to explore further. We had already given him catalogues of geophysical equipment for detecting radio active minerals. The Iraqi Treasury has voted his section ID.20,000 only of which ID.10,000 has already been spent in two diamond drills from America. We will keep in touch with him and let you know any developments.

F. Crawford, head of the Development Division of the B.M.E.O. , commenting on those papers. C. WATERLOW, Secretary.IRAQ CENTRAL DEVELOPMENT BOARD Paragraph 2 (1) , The limiting of the Boards finance to loans from the T^ternatiohal Bank is a serious defect. I agree with the Embassy's proposal for widening its field of revenue. Paragraph 2 (2 ) There is no reason why the Board should not be enabled to entrust Ministries or departments with the execution of certain minor projects* In these, it should have power to assign money for the Ministry or Department concerned* This seems to follow from the proposed inclusion in the Board of the 'Capital Works Budget'. Recruitment of exports should be channelled through the Board. Paragraph 5 I agree. Paragraph 3 (4) . If it is inevitable that, during the life of the Railway Agreement, it is not possible to include railway development in the Board, some means must be found of co-ordinating general and K railway development, e.g. a scheme such as the building of the new Bagdad railway station might not be a high priority. Paragraph 3 (5) . The Finance Minister must be a member of the Board. The difficulty of having ’the Minister concerned as an ex-officio member of the Board’, appears to be that in some projects this may entail having more than one Minister on the Board, and so over-weighting the Board with political members. I would sooner see the Ministers concerned called in as Consultants only. I dislike the idea of having the Prime Minister as Chairman of the Board. He is powerful and ephemeral, and a new Prime Minister might conceivably reverse some or many of the Boards previous decisions. Anything, however, is better than detailed control by the Council of Ministers and if this can be avoided by including the Prime Minister and the Minister concerned, then it is better to do so. Paragraph 2 (6) . I agree. I think that, for the sake of continuity, some system of retirement by rotation of independent members should be devised. Paragraph 2 (7) . Murray and I merely mentioned that in the Persian Seven-Year Plan there was a technical board. I hold no special brief for it. The Bagdad suggestion of Technical Committees seems Just as good. The main points which should be settled are:- (a) Increasing the revenue sources of the Board; (b) To get the reaction of the International Bank to the proposed draft. (For this, it seems necessary to ensure that Ali Mumtaz contacts the Bank at Washington);— CONFIDENTIAL British Embassy, Bagdad* 11th April, 1949. My dear Michael, I enclose a copy of the first draft, produced hy the Iraqi G-overnment, of a Bill for the constitution of the Development Board. I have urged the Prime Minister and everyone else concerned to delay consideration of the draft hy the Council of Ministers and the presentation of the Bill to Parliament until' it has been examined by all who are interested, including the International Bank* Judge Prichard has been asked by the Deputy Prime Minister to give the Iraqi Government his opinion after consultation with the British and American Embassies. I am sending Prichard a copy of this letter privately as 'giving our provisional opinion; but I am emphasising that we should like to give a further opinion after consulting the Foreign Office. I have also advised that Ali Mumtaz should discuss the Bill with the International Bank in Washington. You may like to let Iliffe see confidentially a copy of this letter with your comments. It is important that I should have your comments urgently, as the Bill should be passed by Parliament during this session which is not likely to end much later than June, and I do not think we shall be able to hold Nuri very long from pushing it through in the form which he favours* 2, The Bill is obviously most unsatisfactory and entirely inadequate* You will see from Article 4(a) of the draft that the Board is to have at its disposal only money lent by the International Bank. I can only assume that Nuri regards it chiefly as paper legislation designed to induce the International Bank to give Iraq the loans for which she is asking. Our ideas on the subject are as follows. (l) Provision of Revenues. Iraq now has five budgets; the normal State Budget, with revenue derived from taxation, the Railway Budget, financed by Railway Revenues, the Port and Dredging Budgets financed by their own revenues, and the Capital Works Budget financed by oil royalties, profits of the Currency Board and Iraqi Loans. The Development Board should take over the present Capital Works Budget with the same revenues. Provision should also be made in the Bill for a portion of the ordinary revenues of the State to be loaned or granted by the State Budget to the Development Budget. Minor Capital Works should be met from the ordinary State revenues by appropriations to the various departments concerned. The Board should also have st iYitory power to raise internal and external loans for Development and executive with the lenders the requisite agreements which could include assignments of specific future revenue normally accruing to the Board, such as oil royalties* The Board should be permitted to spend its revenues on development projects, development surveys and its own administrative expenditure. It should employ an outside firm of auditors. M.R. Wright, Esq.., C.M.G,, Foreign Office, London, S.W.l. /(2)...( 2 ) Relationas with the departments and emp loyment of experts _ Although much of the work on the major projects will be executed by contractors under the superintendence of consulting engineers, it is important that the Board should be able to call on departments of Government to undertake work on their behalf, A system of accounting may be devised by mich the departments are paid for such work from the Development Budget. Specialists permanently employed by the Iraqi Government would normally be employed by the departments; but might be called upon to work on behalf of the Board from time to time. Recruitment of experts by the departments might well be channelled through the Board. The Board would also be empowered to employ itself for limited periods for specific purposes, such as industrial consultants carrying out an industrial survey, (3) Executive Functions ^ The Board should be required to survey the general resources of the State, to produce plans for the co-ordinated development of thosd resources, to draw up detailed plans for projects, to decide priority between projects and-to arrange the execution of the projects in such a manner as may seem suitable to them. It should have the power to propose legislation to be introduced by a Minister, to provide for the administration of projects such as the distribution of newly irrigated land and the recovery of ..taxes or special charges from those benefiting from the projects. It should also have power to propose to the Council of Ministers legislation, including fiscal legislation, generally designed to promote development. It should have executive powers required for the completion of each project until the stage when it becomes a matter for normal administration, v/hich must be done by the Government departments. It should have power to arrange for the flotation of companies to develop the resources of the State under which the State would contribute part of the capital and take part in the management. (4) Relations with the Railways and the Port * A saving clause must provide that the Development Board shall not be concerned with Railway Development during the period of the -Railway Agreement; but should consult the Railway Board on all matters under their consideration, in v/hich Railway Development and Railway interests are concerned. It should also have power to lend money to the Railways for Railway Development schemes. I consider . that it would be desirable for the present to exclude Port Development also from the scope of the Board; but to have a similar clause providing for consultation with the Port Administration on matters concerning it, ( 5 ) R elations with the Government,, Under the constitution the budget of the Development Board will have to be approved by the Council of Ministers and presented by one of the Ministers to Parliament, since it will be disposing of revenues of the State. It appears necessary therefore that the Finance Minister should be a /member..«/(c)... member of the Board. If the relations with the departments and the functions of the Board are to be anything approaching •what is described in Clauses 2 and 3 above, it will be ^necessary for its work to be closely integrated with the work of the departments and it will therefore also be desirable that,’ as proposed in the draft Bill, the Minister of the Department for the subject being discussed, should be an ex officio member of the Board. The draft Bill provides • for the Prime Minister to be a member. On principle we ' want as few Ministers as possible on the Board; but in the conditions of Iraq, and in this we are confirmed by Judge Prichard who has as long experience of the country as onyone, we shall have to agree tomsome form of Government control over the Board. The fomal control of the Council of Ministers is required by the constitution* We can choose between either an insistence by the Council of Ministers on detailed control which will hold up the work of the Board or the presence of sufficient Ministers on the Board to make any approval required by the Council of Ministers subsequently a formality* I think that the latter is the least objectionable alternative and I have, therefore, been forced to the conclusion that we should not object to the presence of the Prime Minister on the Board* There should then be no difficulty in getting the sanction of the Council of Ministers to any proposal of the Board which require it. We shall have to try and limit the sanction of the Council of Ministers to the sanction of the Budget and therefore to the annual agreement by the Council to the', plans proposed by the Board. We are much more likely to avoid detailed control by the Council, if the Prime Minister is on the Board, and where the Board’s proposals do require the sanction of the Council, they should in that case go through the Council without any difficulty. Under the recent interpretation of the constitution v/hich we described in o r Chancery letter No. 27/16/49 dated 21st February, it is doubtful whether it is at the moment legal for any Minister to sit on the Development Board. The Iraqi Government have made this difficulty for themsevles and they will have to get over it, even if they have to change the constitution, if they want Ministers to sit on the Board. (6) Composition of the Board. The numbers must be as small as; possible; but the Board must be balanced. It will not be easy to find good men prepared to sit on the Board who will agree not to go back into politics while they are members. It is desirable to try and get foreign experts on the Board, in order that it shall contain some people who understand who is being discussed, and shall be restrained from being too political or partial in its decisions. I think that we should try for the following composition as being the best in the circumstances. (a) Prime Minister, Finance Minister, and Minister of the Department concerned. (*) Three independent members.■■ ' (c) Three experts. One of the experts should also be a Secretary-General of the Board and in charge of its administrative and executive functions* Specific limitation to foreign experts, even if only for an initial period, would be desirable, but possibly no^ ; practicable. One expert, might in fact be for a period.a representative of the International Bank, if they we: e prepared to co-operate to this extent. We want of course to get an Englishman as Secretary-* General. (7) Technical Organisation * • Crav/ford and Murray have suggested a Technical Board under the Planning Board. I think, however, that it will be better to have experts on the Planning Board and make provision to enable the Board to set up Technical Committees for specific purposes. 3. The Bill will clearly require complete redrafting and it is not necessary to comment further on its provisions. We cannot of course hope to secure the adoption of all the suggestions mentioned, above but we shall' : of course do our best to secure the essentials, r ‘- ; ; I am sending a copy of this letter to the British Middle East Office; but you will, no doubt, show it to Troutbeck and Crawford in London.DRAFT LAW FOR THF BOARD OF ADMINISTRATION OF CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT WORKS.

The Prime Minister called on ^pril 21st at his own request and said he vaulted to talk about oil. 2. He nov understood (possibly for the first time) that any loan from the International Bank would be confined to external expenditure. This being so, money for internal cost of projects could only be found from oij royalties. 3. He then gave me special account of his discussions with Vheatley. It does not tally with the account I have since had from hheatley himself out this may well be due merely to Purl pasha's imperfect grasp of details wid figures and is anyway beside the point. Nuri pasha ooserved that the Iraqi petroleum Company were still disinclined to develop Mosul and that further compensation was therefore indicated, say 3 million pounds, which the Iraqi Government would use to finance this internal cost of the development projects. He was evidently thinking-of loc-ns which the Iraqi Petroleum Company nave made in the past in return for extensions of periods within which under various conventions any export of oil should commence. 4.

(This is Noonan's calculation). . How could he defend that position before public opinion. 5. At this point he became evasive but the remarks drew from him a re-statement of his attitude on Haifa. This was briefly:- (a) That if the port, including the refinery, were internationalised pumping could-start within half an hour. A free port would not do: that meant Jewish sovereignty; (b) Jews should show they really meant to be friendly by agreeing either to the Assembly plan or the Bernadotte plan and not try to grab the best of both plans. 6. In case of (b), he said the pipe line could be moved to Arab Acre. I said, what about the refinery. He replied that he was not concerned with it; he was concerned with getting crude away. 7. Absent-mindedly, perhaps, he ignores that under the Bernadotte plan Acre would be no longer Arab, whilst only under the Bernadotte plan v/as there to be any special dispensation for Haifa and that merely a free port. 8. I have discussed the above fully with Noonan and Wheatley. Wheatley says that the rocky sea-floor, rules Acre out anyway; otherwise, he added, the Iraqi Petroleum Company would have sited their terminal there in the beginning. 9. Wheatley thinks the frame of mind disclosed by the Prime Minister in paragraph 6 gives him an opening which he should make the most of, and he proposes to sound the Prime Minister to see whether he would be prepared to acquiesce in the feeding of the refinery exclusively by crude from the Persian Gulf whilst Iraqi crude is devoted exclusively to export. . ■ /10.

(Miss C. Waterlow) 27th April. 1949*ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST For the purposes of this Paper, the Middle East is broadly speaking considered to compriso the Arab countries , Persia and the Nile Basin (excluding Uganda). The problem of economic and social development in the Middle East is at once an opportunity, a responsibility and a challenge. 2. Danger o f Communism Communist influence has recently been extended over a large part of China. There is a grave risk of its further extension into South East Asia. If the Middle East were also to fall under Communist control the cause of the democratic countries would suffer a cripp ling blow. The economic recovery of the United Kingdom and Western Europe would be gravely affected. The way would be opened for the spread of Communism into the rest of Africa. The position of Turkey ? Greece and Italy would be largely undermined. The ability of Russia to wage successful war against the West would be greatly increased. The defence of the United Kingdom in the event of war would be compromised. 3. But we must face the fact that many of the conditions which favoured the extension of Communism in China exist in the Middle East. H.M. Government were largely responsible for the emergence of most of the Middle East count ries as independent and self-governing peoples. But the transition from centuries of Turkish /misruleIpippp misrule to self-government under modern world conditions is a difficult one* Corruption, inefficiency and poverty are still endemic. The standard of living of the mass of the people is appallingly low, and the contrast with the is glaring. In spite of the contradiction be tween the principles of the Moslem religion and of Communism, there are almost classic opportunities for Communist agitation by the exploitation of hardship, chaos and discontent. The failure of their efforts in Palestine has kept the Arab countries in a state of demoralisation offering a field for dictatorial adventures , whether of the Right or of the Left. U* To prevent the Middle East falling behind the Iron Curtain must be a ma^or objective of our policy and therefore merits a high priority in effort and contribution. The Communist danger cannot be met by a negative or passive approach, but by grasping the positive opportunities which exist. Middle East Governments are alive to the wealth of the small and selfish ruling classes Pos it ive Opportunities-3- 6. Large areas of the Middle Bast were in the past prosperous, fertile and highly civil ised. Major opportunities exist for irrigation, flood control and increased food production in Egypt, the Sudan, Syria and Iraq, which in addition to raising local consumption, may in due course provide export surpluses for other areas. The raising of the general standard of living will increase the importance of the Middle East as a market for imported goods. The continued and expanded development of oil r- sources ought in the coming years to afford considerable wealth to Persia, Saudi Arabia, the Arab Sheikhdoms and Iraq. Other development possibilities exist. ?• United Kingdom investments in the Area are in the neighbourhood of . The Middle East is the source of supply of certain essential commodities. For example, Egypt and the Sudan are the only source of strong long-stable cotton for the production of high-grade textiles on which Lancashire’s future depends. It is probable that in the course of the next season, we will be spending as much as £50 million at present prices on Egyptian cotton, and about £1 CH*12 million on cotton from the Sudan. The Sudan, too, supplies about 30% of the world’s requirement of gum arabio and the Middle East as a whole is one of the most important sources of the supply of hides and skins.

In September 1945 the Foreign Secretary called a Conference of British representatives in the Middle East, to survey the whole field of our policy in the area and to make recom mendations on future, lines of action. The recommendations which he then submitted to the Cabinet (C.P.(45)174 of September 17th, 1945), and which received their approval, called •amongst other things for the following:- (a) the establishment of the British Middle East Office in Cairo, one of whose responsibilities would be the co ordination and development of British /poliaypolicy in its economic aspects in the Middle East region; (h) the setting up of machinery for the coordination of Middle East policy in London. 9* At the same time it was agreed (c) that economic development and social betterment mast go forward hand in hand; (d) that His Majesty’s Government should encourage Middle East Governments to draw up their own' plans for economic development and should offer to place at their disposal technical and specialist assistance to help them in formulating their schemes; (e) that we should steer local develop ment plans along lines in conformity with the limitations imposed on ourselves by our own financial and supply situation and with the needs of the region as a whole. 10. As a result of the first recommendation the British Middle East Office .was duly established with a Development Dividon to which were appointed advisers in agriculture, forestry and soil con servation, animal husbandry, health, labour, statistics and entomology. A description of their activities is given in paragraph 19* 11, The second recommendation led to the sotting up of a Ministerial Committee under the /chairmanship-6 chairmanship of the Foreign Secretary and a Middle East (Official) Committee under the chairmanship of the Minister of State, In fact, the Middle East Committee of Ministers has never met, while the Middle East (Official) Committee has met-on only eight occasions. The inactivity of these Committees has heen mainly due to the fact that the preoccupation of Middle East countries with Palestine has made it impossible to achieve much progress with schemes of development. For the same reason, plans which were discussed in 1947 in Wash ington for Anglo-American economic cooperation in the Middle East (see paragraph 15) have not yet been fully implemented, 12, There is now however some reason to hope that a settlement in Palestine may soon be reached. Moreover, the attitude to us of most of the Middle East countries has taken a turn for the better and there is reason to hope that, in view of the possibilities opened up by President Truman’s Fourth Point, Middle East Governments may be prepared to pay more attention to economic development and social reform. The whole problem has taken on a new urgency as a result of the emergence of Israel and the expulsion from their homes of over 800,000 Palestinian Arabs, while the economic future of Greater Transjordan and the financial stability of Iraq are matters of increasingly grave concern, 13* The time is now ripe therefore for taking stock of the situation, for reviewing our machinery both at home and in the field, /and-7- and for considering how farther progress can best be achieved. 14. As a first step, the Middle East (Official) Oommittee has been reconstituted, under the chair manship of an Assistant Under-Secretary in the Foreign Office,, The Middle East (Offield) Committee has in turn set up a Working Party, under Foreign Office chairmanship, consisting of representatives of the Foreign Office, the Troasui^ the Board of Trade and the Central Economic and Planning Staff -, together with representatives of other Departments concerned with particular sub jects under discussion. The terms of reference of the Working Party are set out in Annex A. 15. Attit ude of the U,S. Government . The United States Government has reached parallel and similar conclusions about the import ance of economic and social development in the Middle Easts Annex B to this Paper contains the agreed results of discussions between the United States and H,M„ Government held in Washington in October 1947 (ME(0)(47)28 of November 11th, 1947)). 16. Act ion - T hree Phases Measures for economic and social develop ment may be regarded as falling into three phases - Survey, Planning and Implementation. 17. The initial phase of Survey has now been virtually completed, and the time has come when we should pass into the phases of Planning and Implementation, which to some extent overlap# 18. Phase I - Su rve y . A brief resume may be useful of what has been accomplished over the past few years in respect of economic and social development in the Middle Eastc /19- 8 ~ 19 . To start with r certain economic fields were surveyed by the Middle East Supply Oen^e and form the subject of a number of basic reports. Since the establishment of the British Middle East Office in 1945 the members of its Development Division have toured the area and submitted reports to the Governments concerned, with recommendations covering their various fields,, These fields include general agriculture, forestry and soil conservation, animal husbandry, health, labour and industrial conditions, locust control and statistical organ isation. The oil companies have been at work prospecting and developing the oil resources of the area, and building up welfare services on a scale unprecedented in the Middle Ba,-t # Country-wide surveys hove been made by the British firm of Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners in Syria and the Lebanon, and by the American consortium. Overseas Consultants, Inc. , in Persia. Detailed surveys have been made by British consultants of flood control and irr- gation in Iraq, where plans have also beea formulated in such fields as railway and road development, construction of bridges and the establishment of a University. Transjordan has employed a British Director of Lands and Surveys who has surveyed the country and maintained close touch with the British Middle East Office. Even the feudal Government of Saudi Arabia has now accepted British advice in the medical fie Id e The Egyptians have indicated their agreement to participate with us in /the-'9&lt; the execution of the comprehensive schemes for the utilisation of the Nile Waters and the Egyptian Parliament has voted £Eki million as a contribution to the combined hydro-electric station and dam at Owen Palls. Apart from that, Egypt, in addition to being more advanced than the remainder in technic 1 knowledge, prefers to make its own arrangements for employing foreign advisers and consults the British Middle East Office little except on questions of health, locust control and labour relations. But broadly speaking it may be said that the whole area has been well surveyed and there is now sufficient knowledge of what can and should be done. 20. The ideas are set out in numerous reports. The problem today is not so much to search for further ideas as to put into effect those ideas which have been patiently accumulated. 21. Phase 2: Planning Phase 2 is in many ways the most dif ficult phase of the whole operation. It comprises all the stages between the general survey (Phase I) and the request for tenders for specific projects (which is the beginning of Phase 3). It may perhaps be divided into three main parts: (a) the establishment by the Govern ments concerned of the appropriate machinery for the proper planning of development. (b) the selection of 1be most suitable prt&gt;j o c tr out c:? t hos : s urvoyed in relation to tlvo financial and economic res cures s -of the /country- 10 ' country concerned; and the estab- lishment of priorities 0 (c) decisions by the Governments con- cerned with regard to the extent and method of utilising internal resources and outside financial assistance a 22. Annex C to this Paper contains a short list of (a) the surveys which have been carried out in the various fields of economic and social, development and (b) of specific major projects which have been recommended. The list is illustrative rather than exhaustive. The main problem which faces us now is the transition from Phase I to Phase 2 and it is on this that our diplomatic and technical effort will have to be concentrated in the immediate future. 23# Phase 3 - Imp lementation . The obstacles in the path of implent- ation of these schemes are formidable. Inertia, inefficiency and corruption have to be overcome. Lack of trained personnel will be a serious difficulty. Encouragement and assistance will be required from without, 2h* It is for consideration how far most of the Middle East countries are in fact capable of undertaking the requisite work themselves. None the less, there are strong arguments in favour of their being encouraged and assisted to assume the responsibility of doing so and thus acquiring the practice and the pride of tackling their own problems themselves, rather than having them carried out entirely by /foreigrersforeigners or by internatijnal organisations. 25. Effective progress will probably involve in many cases: (a) the reorganisation of the admin istrative machine and tax system; (b) social reforms, including reform of land tenure systems; (c) a settled policy of land use; (d) the establishment of Central and probably Area Development Boards, with independent finance, to deter mine priorities and push ahead with individual projects; (e) in cases where large schemes are not immediately possible, the early establishment of u sample' projects, 26. A combination of two methods will be required to bring the necessary pressure to bear on the local Governments:- (a) measures of persuasion, e.g. diplomatic pressure, rnd education and publicity to build up a body of public opinion which Governments cannot ignore, and (b) offers of assistance which can be with held if Governments are obstructive. Such offers can take the form of financial assistance, material supplies, technical expertise and train ing facilities. 27. Though most of the Governments concerned should be able by a reform of the taxation system to meet their needs in local currency and should in some cases find no difficulty in a few years* time in meeting their needs for foreign currency, nevertheless they are likely to /require- 12 - require considerable foreign financial assistance in the immediate future to prime tbe pump. Some of the materials required too are world sc^g'c- ities, and it will be necessary to ensure that the Middle East countries get their share. Finally, these countries will need foreign advisers to help in such matters as reforming their administrations, carrying out- research and training, improving social conditions and exeucuting such projects as may be determined* 28. International Org anisations Particular importance attaches to the question whether encouragement and assistance to Middle East countries should be afforded principally (a) by H.M. Government and by the U.3. Government or (b) through the medium of the United Nations and its associated organis ations. Some of these, e.g. the International Bank, the World Health Organisation, UNE .00 and the Food and Agriculture Organisation are already at work in the Middle East. 29. The Foreign Secretary has expressed a very strong preference for course (a). The State Department have indicated to us that they also incline to this view. If this policy is adopted it will not, of course, mean that there is no role for the U.N„ organisations to PlAy, The International Bank in particular may be able to render the most desirable assistance. But it would definitely mean that their role, with the possible exception of the Bank, would be subsidiaryo Their activities would as far as possible, be confined to the advisory field and in this field steps would be taken to /ensureensure that they did not duplicate the work of the British Middle East Office. We should in any case strongly discourage any tendency for these organisations to undertake executive functions, e.g. in connection with the Nile waters and the Iraqi Irrigation and Flood Control projects. We do not wish to see these undertaken under United Nations auspices, 30, Coonoratijn with the U.S. Government It will probably be desirable to discuss our ideas with the State Department as soon as we succeed in clarifying them. Such a discussion would be a logical sequel to the Washington Talks of October 1947 and to subsequent contacts with the State Department. 31, Re c omm end a tions (a) the principle should be endorsed that economic development and social reform in the Middle East is an essential interest of H.M. Government. (t&gt;) H.M. Government should use all its influence with the Middle East Govern ments towards the implementation of plans for economic development. (c) Requests from the Middle East countries for British financial industrial and technical assistance in the implementation of these plans should be accorded a high priority, subject of course to suitable safeguards. In this connection it should be borne in mind that the oil- producing countries may require part payment of royalties in hard currencies if we cannot meet their capital /equipment-tv- equipment requirements from the sterling area-, (d) The Middle East (Official) Com- ^ mittee and its Working Party and other appropriate ‘Committees should urgently study the means hy which the above recommendations can be put into effect* (e) As soon as we have formed a clearer view of what should be done and of the nature of the contribution which H.M. Government can make to its fulfilment we should renew discussion of the whole problem with'the U.S* Government with a view to seeing how far they are prepared to participate* (f) We should encourage application to the International Bankfor financial assistance provided that (a) the loans could be serviced without serious difficulty and (b) that if made in hard currencies, they would not prejudice the import of equipment which the U*K. could provide and for which payment could be made in sterling by the country concerned. (g) While the policy of cooperation between the British Middle East Office and the United Nations specialised Agencies /(e.g„■ (e,g. the FAO and the WHO) should not He discontinued, assistance to Middle Bast countries should be furnished by H.M. Government and the U.S. Government# The direct intervention of the United Nations in economic and social development in the Middle East would afford apportunitioo for Russia, and the satellite countries to enter the area.

IRA Q.. 1. With a population of about 44- millions, Iraq is at present a backward, poor and undeveloped country. Her infant mortality rate is estimated to be as high as 6C$ and the population is said to be at present barely increasing. Immense possibilities of economic development nevertheless exist, which, if exploited, could transform Iraq into a rich and prosperous state. These lie in (a) her oil resources and (b) her river water resources, which if properly developed could result in a tremendous expansion of agricultural production, enabling Iraq to become the granary of the Middle East, The development of the country cannot, however, take place without administrative and social reform and assistance from outside sources in the form of technical advice and capital investment, 2, Anglo-Iraai Treaty; An outstanding factor affecting British economic policy towards Iraq is the existence of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance and the tradition of British technical assistance which has •resulted from it. The Iraqis are entitled to expect substantial benefits from the alliance and its existence must, at all times, colour our attitude towards all requests for help in whatever form they are received. The number of British officials in ' Iraq was 276 in 1929, 236 in 1939 and 233 in 1948 / At present2 At present, partly for financial reasons 'but partly also to propitiate internal xenophobia, the Iraq Government is deliberately reducing the number of foreign experts employed and making virtually no new appointments. 3• P lans for Economic and Social Development: P resent Position. A beginning has been made in drawing up plans for economic and social development and in starting work on certain specific projects. The present position may be summarised as follows:- (a) F lood Cont rol and Irrigation A British Irrigation Development Commission was appointed early in 1946 to draw up plans for the irrigation development of the country. The results of the Commission^ work (which is now almost completed) are described in greater detail in M.Eo(0)(49)5 of the 1st April. Detailed plans for tlood control and water storage works have been prepared and a tentative scheme for distribution works, lands drainage, electricity works and improved river navigation has been outlined. These plans will.enable the area under irrigation in Iraq to be expanded from the present figure of less than 7 million acres to about 16 million acres. The total cost involved is estimated at £113 millions divided as follows Flood control and storage £25.4 million Irrigation development £36.5 » Drainage £40.2 « / Power3 Power £7.8 million Navigation £3.0 it Development on this immense scale must necessarily take place gradually and in step with the growth of the population and the mechanisation of agriculture. The Irrigation Commission consider that the full development outlined above is unlikely to be required before the end of the century. Spread out over this period, the cost would involve an average annual expenditure of about £3 million only. Meanwhile, the immediate needs are flood control, limited irrigation development and drainage in the old irrigated areas. On this basis the Commission has recommended a programme of works for the next ten years involving an expenditure of £24,200,000, or £2,420,000 per annum. Work has now already begun on the first stage of the water storage works which the Commission has prepared for the Euphrates. The Commission's recommendations for the Tigris have been studied by the Iraq Governments Consulting Engineers who have recoLmended an alternative combination of works which would be rather more expensive. When the Iraq Government has taken a decision as between these recommendations and those of the Commission, it is hoped that the first stage of the works will be put in hand without further delay. A tentative list of equipment required for the first stage of the Wadi Tharthar scheme has been prepared by the Commission. The total estimated / costNINHMM! - 4 - cost is nearly £3 millions, of which nearly £2 millions worth will probably have to be procure.: in the United States of America* Information about the equipment required for the completion of the Habbaniyah scheme is being sought. The Commission anticipates that a large proportion of the capital expenditure will be recovered from the increase in land values resulting fr m the works, and that revenue sufficient to make the various projects productive will be obtained. They have submitted detailed proposals to the Iraq Government for a taxation system to cover the cost of the works, involving the levying of taxes on urban property, irrigated land and the crops produced, (b) Railways : The Iraqi State Railways Administration (which is directed by British officials and has an independent budget) has drawn up a programme of development works, estimated to cost about £10 millions. These works include three bridges over the Euphrates, Tigris and Lesser Zab rivers, a new railway station and layout at Bagdad, a seventy mile rail extension from Kirkuk to Erbil in Northern Iraq and the purchase of rolling stock in the United Kingdom, Work on them has now been put in hand and £4 i million has already been' expended. In order, however, to enable the works to be completed it will be essential for the Railway Administration to receive a loan from outside sources of at least £5 millions. Tentative plans have also been prepared for the considerable expansion of the Iraqi railway system both internally and by construction of new lines / linkinglinking Iraq with Turkey and Syria. The estimated cost of these long-term projects is about £34 million of which £15) millions would he spent in the purchase of equipment abroad* In September 1947 the Iraq Government asked His Majesty* s Government to seleet for them a railway commission composed of three senior British experts to advise on the railway Administration long term plans and also on the co-ordinated development of railway, road and water transport. Unfortunately, however, before the team had been found the request was withdrawn owing to the change of government after the failure of the Portsmouth Treaty, and has not since been renewed. (c) Ro ad s. In 1947, the Iraq Government requested His Majesty’s Government to recruit for them six senior British road engineers to carry out the road development of the country. Although candidates were found for all these posts, the Iraqis eventually only decided to appoint a Chief Road Engineer (Mr. J 0 B.. Skinner of the Ministry of Transport) and to fill one other post for one year. Mr. Skinner has prepared a ten year road development plan for new first class r'oads linking the main towns of Iraq. The estimated cost of this programme is £14, 500,000. Mr. Skinner is insisting that this work should be put out to internationally reputed contractors and that competent British staff should be engaged to supervise it. At present, funds to embark on this programme / are not6 are not yet in sight* (&amp;) Agriculture: In audition to the possibilities of expanding irrigated cultivation, described in paragraph (a) above, there are great possibilities of agricultural development in the rainfall zone in Northern Iraq. In this area it is estimated that the total cultivable land is about 10 million acres, while the total land at present cultivated annually is only about l-§- million acres. There are also considerable possibilities of livestock and fishery development, while agricultural pest control is an outstanding need in Iraq. Development of Iraq’s agriculture cannot take place on a short-term basis, since the first requirements are (a) research into agronomic factors, pest control, livestock improvement, soil chemistry, plant breeding and plant physiology; (b) a great expansion of agricultural extension work; (c) a gradual expansion of mechanisation; (d) land tenure reform, to break down the power of the Sheikhs, improve the position of the small cultivator, and make possible the development of State land; and., as a corollary to such reform, legislation to forestall speculation in land made cultivable by development. Recruitment of Experts : In recognition of the importance of the first two requirements, however, the Iraq Government have during the past three years asked His Majesty’s Government to recruit for them some 25 senior British agricultural experts to serve in their Ministry of Economics. After an extensive and difficult search, candidates were / were found7 - were found for the majority of these posts. In the event, however, the Iraqis only made six appointments. Of these, two botanists are now in Bagdad. An animal husbandry expert and an agricultural machinery expert were appointed but their contracts have already been terminated prematurely, and an entomologist and a soil technologist have been offered- posts but have not yet accepted. All the other posts - including the most important of all, that of agronomist - have been either cancelled or held in abeyance* Sir Herbert Stewart, Agricultural Adviser to the British Middle East Office, has now recommended that the appointment of the following foreign experts is essential to the agricultural development of Iraq: (i) an agronomist (ii) a soil technologist (iii) a director of agricultural machinery (iv) an entomologist (v) a soil conservation officer for the North (vi) an agricultural education adviser (vii) a forest officer (but see (e) below) (viii) an extension services officer (ix) a director of agricultural research (x) an economic botanist (xi) an animal husbandry officer (xii) a sheep-breeding officer and wool expert (xiii) an expert In co-operative organisations (but see (i) below) / Mechanisation8 Mechanisation o f Arrrl culture; , Ehe Iraq Government at present owns about 100 tractors, and there are about 400 tractors in private hands in the country. In 1947 the Government planned to increase thenimbers of* tractors in the country to 2,000, but was unable to carry out this programme owing to shortage of funds. A bill has now been submitted to the Majlis to set up an Administrative Council to control the importatijn, sale and distribution of all agricultural machinery, thereby completely eliminating private trade. If the bill goes through, it is possible that American manufacturers may refuse to export agricultural machinery to Iraq. The Government has also submitted a request to the International Bank for a loan of 4 million dinars to enable it to carry out a ten year scheme for the mechanisation of agriculture, involving an area of 460,000 acres, kand tenure refo rm an., land .evelooment legislation ; No Iraqi Government is at present willing to grapple with these measures, in view of the powerful vested interests involved. It is hoped that the Central Development Board, when set up, will be able to secure some action in this field. / ( G ) Forestr y-9- • ( e ) forestr y: In 1946 the Iraqi Government appointed .Mr* G* W. Chapman of the Colonial Forest Service as head of their Forestry Department r and a junior British forestry officer was appointed this year to assist Mr. Chapman* During his three years in Iraq Mr. Chapman has laid the foundations for the sound forestry development of the country* He has set on foot a forestry survey, drafted forest legislation, established •demonstration plantations and experiments, organised the recruitment and training of the Forestry Service and generally laid the basis for a sound policy of long-term development* Mr* Chapman’s contract is, however, due to expire this year and he is not willing to renew it unless the Iraq Government can offer him a higher salary* If Hr* Chapman cannot be retained or replaced the excellent work which he has started will be largely wasted* (f) He alt h Services : During the past three years the Iraq Government has increased the number of Brit ish medical professors and specialists employed at the Royal Medical College, Bagdad, and in provincial hospitals* These now total Of particular imp or t a n cc is t he re ce nt appointment of Dr. J. i.u Watson, a specialist in bilharzia, as professor of biology. Dr. Data on has already written a report for the Iraq Government on bilharzia research and control and it is hoped that as and when the irrigation schemes mature, he will be able to ensure that this vital aspect of public health- 10 - is adequately dealt with# Another* important appointi:icnt just approved is that of Tuberculosis Export and it is hoped that this post will soon bo xilled* aioanwhile * Iraq_’s outstanding no^.s in the medical field are considered to be;- , ( a ) the^ appointment of a senior British public health expert to organise the Public Health Services of the country; (b) improvement of the nursing services; (c) expansion of teaching facilities in t iic bas ic me di cal s c ic nccs. (g) Statistics: Dr. J. hurray, the Statistical Adviser to the B* i:»a* 0, , has spent a considerable proportion of his time during the past two years in Iraq, where he has organised a Central Statistical Office for t ao Iraq Government and re—organised the stc*tistice. 1 sections of all their Government Departments. As a result largely of his work the first census over to be taken in Iraq hc.s just been completed with particular oificicncy. (its results are not yet available). Dr. Murray’s work will prove of outstanding importance as uotailed dcvelopiiient planning proceeds. (h) Labour : Nr. Li.T.Audaley, the Labour Adviser to the B. M.E.O. has paid a number of visits to Iraq during the past three years. The country has no Social Insurance system, no coherent Trade Union policy and no adequate labour Department. The development of a sound labour policy is considered to be urgent since the C ost /V cost of living (which is now about 6^ times what it v/as before the war), is out of all proportion to the wage structure of the country and this in its turn is completely unbalanced as between the various principal industrial undertakings* In these circumstances, there is growing distress and unrest* The Iraq Petroleum Company is, however, setting an outstanding example, not only by the high rates of wages paid, b ut by t he weIf are ame nitie s it provides and the action which it is taking to promote industrial trading, co-operation and trade union development* Mr* Audsley has now persuaded the Iraq Government to appoint a British Social and .Labour Adviser to prepare a comprehensive labour plan for the country and supervise its execution* (i) Co- ope rat i ve Dove 1 0 '^me nt : In 1946, Hr. B. J* 3urridge, at present Co-operative Adviser to the Colonial Office, was appointed by the Iraq Government to draw up a plan for agricultural co-operative development* No action, has, however, yet been taken on Mr* Surridge’s report. ( 3 ) Establishm e nt of a U nive rsity at Bagdad* In l94o, Dc« A. B. Morgan of the British Council and Professor Sir Charles Darwin prepared for the Iraq Government a plan for the establishment of a University at Bagdad* No estimate of the cost was made, but it v/as pointed out thmt capital expenditure running into £ millions v/as likely to be required* It is understood that the Iraq Government propose to begin implementing this plan this year* No decision hus yat been taken as to whether its staff should be drawn from Arab or- 12 - £ (k) listaljlishi.icnt of a Central Dovclopraont Board; In 1947 it was sumacs ted to the Iraa Prime Minister by H. II. Ambassador at Bagdad and the Head of the B. II. B. 0, th t it v/as most important thc.t a Central Development Board, composed of elder statesmen and senior experts v/ho were outside politics, should be set up to plan and co-ordinate the lon.c-term development of the country, and that a British secretory should be attached to this Board v/ho would, we hoped, largely direct its activities* The Prime Minister expressed agreement with these s up pest ions but no action was taken* The present Prime Minister is reported to Iv.ve decided at last to set up a permanent Development Board and to be submitting legislation for this purpose. He has not, howe ve r, c o rani 11 c d hims c If to t he ap point me nt of a British secretary. (1) Mstablishiaent of a National Bank: The Iraqi Government has decided to establish a national Bank to take over the responsibility for currency issue from the Iraqi Currency Board, which operates at present from London* The Prii.ic Minister is aware that there is no Iraqi capable of being an efficient Governor of the Bank* nevertheless, he has decided to appoint an Iraqi Governor, with a strong British Deputy* Me consider the latter post to be of greet importance since the Deputy Governor will be in a key position to steer t he G o ve r nmc n t ’ s financial policy on the right linos*/- 13 - lines* Ho will thus virtually replace the British Financial Adviser, whose contract was terminated in 1947* '7o hope to secure the appointment of Hr* Decks* of the Bank of 3n r land at present Exchange Controller in Iraq, to this post* ( rn ) Oil Production : Oil production in Iraq fell from 4*7 million tons in 1946 to 3*15 million tons in 1946# as a result ox the closure of the Haifa pipeline* jf the oil companies * development plains yo according to schedule, and the pipeline is re-opened soon, production should rise to 13*5 million tons‘in 1951 and 30 million tons in 1956* At the present rate of oil royalties this would mean that hy 1951 , receipts would amount to nearly £6 million, and hy 1956 to over £13 million* As a result of the current, negotiations between the Iraq Government ^nd the Iraq Petroleum Company for the revision of the latter’s concession, the oil royalty rate may well he increased hy as much as 30 %• 4# Financial situc.t ion t The present financial situation of Iraq is imp ort ant curre nt c omnit men t salaries and payr.icnts to British contractors encased on financial/ *; t- 14 - financiul strain of the Palestinian war and (c) the reduction of income from oil royalties and rents frou-^2,3 millions in 1947 to .51 • 7 millions in 194h on account of the closing of the Kirkulc- Haifa pipeline, A further serious factor is the extremely averse balance of payiuents situation* Complete figures are not yet available for 194$ but the deficit for the year is likely t o bo in the region of ,520 millions against imports which may be estimated at d45 million* This deficit has been covered by releases of blocked sterling balances during 194; to the extent of £11. 9 million; and under the 1947 ^:rccmont a further £10 million are due to.be released to Iraq by the end of July, 1949. This will leave only £3 million sterling balances in hand at that date Lifter allowing for the retention of £33*5 as sterling cover for the currency circulation. The Iraq Government have now introduced import licence control, but they have not accepted a suggestion which wc have made that British Customs Collectors should be appointed at Bagdad and Basra* to meet the immediate crises the Iraq Government has had to resort to borrowing from the Banks and from the Iraq Currency Board to the extent of over £7^ million* The Government is hoping to obtain a loan of about £44 million from the IPC as part of the arrangements for a revision of tho Company’s concession* He an while , the Government is making a determined effort to balance the budget for 1949-1930, and to provide a surplus, by means of legislation to increased taxation and reduction of departmental expenditure and the high cost of living allowances* &lt;*3 soon as wo are sait isf iod/-15- satisfled. that ^oasonahla progress towards rofoprii has been made, wo propose to authorise the Iraq Government to raise a railway loan oi* ,03 million on the London market to finance the projects described at (b) above• From a short-term point of view, therefore, there is reasonable hope that the financial position will soon be stabilised# From a lo nr-term point of view, in 5 - 10 years’ time Iraq should have all the funds she needs for development — and more - from oil royalty receipts (see 3( li 0 above)# In the. interim period, however, it will be essential for the Government to obtain a substantial foreign loan to enable the railway, road and irrigation development programmes to be set on foot* The Iraq Government have now applied for a loan of ml9*5 millions from the International Bank of which 03*3 millions is for road development; .Sll.2 millions for irrigation development and £5 millions for the railways# (An unspecified proportion of this sum covers internal expenditure, however, which the Bank is net qualified to finance). a loan on this scale is considered to be out of the question for the present but it is understood that the Bank might bo prepared to consider making a loan of about 10 million dollars within the next few months for external expenditure on specified projects# Tha Banx proposed to send a technical mission to Iraq this month to study the matter# 5« T ar gets f 1 r f up t he r do ye 1 opme n t ; It will be seen from the above that during the past three years, plans for development and progress have been drawn up in many fields. The next stop - and a far more difficult one - is to implement /-16- implenicnt thcso plans#- To onalDlc this to he done it is essential (a) That a aieasure of administrative reform should he carried out. The Iraq Government has put through some tax reforms on paper and these^ iiiust he implemented. . jt must he ensured that taxes aro P a; i-3 and tae proceeds p*o to the Treasury. The Iraqi civil service is certainly under-paid and proouhly over-staffed# It must he made into an efficient machine; (h) That the proposed Central Development hoard should he set up without delay# This Board must he independent of the political machine and have wide pov/ers to plan and co-ordinate development policy in all fields. As these , plans mature it may prove desirable to entrust their execution in certain fields to regional, or functional development authorities with independent hud pets of their own# Meanwhile, the essential requirement is that the plans already prepared should he co-ordinated at every stare and that a programme of priorities should he war hod out on a lon;;-tcrm basis and in relation to the estimated availability of funds for development. The success of the Development Board will probably depend largely upon the appointment of the British secretary who must he a man of outstanding calibre; (c) ^.n essential corollary to (b) is that highly qualified foreign experts should be appointed to advise the main government departments on development policy’and supervise its execution. Meanwhile, the targets for development to be considered by the Central Development Board in the light of the situation described in para. 3 above may be 3 umm; risod as foil ows : - (a-)/(a) to embark on the energetic execution of the plans prepared for capital development works in irrigation, roads and railways; (?j) to embark on a co-ordinated long-term policy of agricultural development involving largo scale research work, agricultural extension work and the introduction of mechanisation and for this purpose to appoint 11 foreign (c) * (d) experts; to introduce land tenure reforms for existing cultivated land and to draw up plans for the tenure and colonisation of newly developed land - e.g., to consider development by means of public utility corporations or regional boards; to foilow up the plans for forestry development «, worked out by Mr* Chapman and to appoint a British successor to him; to i. /ip lo me n t t he S urr id go re p or t on co-operative development and to appoint a f oreign co-opcrativc expert; to prepare plans for the development of adequate Public Health Cervices and to appoint a British expert to carry them out; to press ahead with the establishment of a university ^t Bagdad; to promote technical training at the foreman level on a wider scale; and0)/ (i) to embark on a progressive labour policy and, for this purpose to appoint a British labour adviser. 6. Recommendations: ^ It is suypestocl that this paper in its final f orm s hould submi t re coiTL ie nd ati ons c ove ring: (a) the extent to which H. M. G. should be prepared to make sterling loans to Iraq during the interim period until revenue from oil royalties begins to assume significant proportions; (b) the conditions which we should attach to any such loc.ns, e.g. , the satisfactory constitution of the Central Development Board, the appointment of British experts to certain key posts, and (in the case of a railway loan) the carrying out of a survey by a British railway and transport commission (see paragraph 3(b) above); (c) the extent to which we should at ten pt to moot Iraq’s capitc.l equipment rcquiro.ients from U« Iv. sources, bearing in mind that, in so far as we cannot do this, wo may bo obliged at a later stage to make available a largo proportion of the oil roye.lty payments in dollars; (d) in the light of ( c ) whether we should c ncourage: (i) the International Bank to make large scale dollar loans to Iraq, and (ii) the U. 3. Government to make loans to Iraq through the Import-I)Xpert Bank or other agoncy;- 19 - (g) if the rocorm.iendation on (h) is in the affini tive, the desirahility of urgent ly consult ing tho U. 3. Government and the International Bank regarding (b) above, in order that we might prepare with them an agreed list of conditions which both they and we should attach to any loans made; (f) the desirability of consulting the U. S* Government on the question of the provision of experts under all the headings (a) to (i) above, with a view to determining which could most appropriately be provided from British and which from. U. S. sources - bearing in mind our special commitment under the ./.nglo-lraqi Treaty. It is for consideration whether wo should suggest to the Americans that they should provide advice in the agricultural field, leaving to us the fields of engineering, transport, labour and university education; (g) steps to be taken to improve the conditions of service of British experts in Iraq which might e.g. involve? (i) the working out of secondment arrangements from the United Kin ;dom,and (ii) subsidisation of certain posts; (h) since u» 3. experts are most unlikely to be attracted by the terms at present offered, the desirability in the light of/(i) ■■I , - 20 - of the roconiraDelation made unde 3 ?
