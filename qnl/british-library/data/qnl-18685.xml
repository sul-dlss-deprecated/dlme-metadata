The following extracts, paragraphs 26 and 27, of a Desp atch from the Hon'ble Court, bearing date the 23rd June 1852, No. 19, are forwarded for vour information and for communication to all the subordinate Officers in your Department, to whom it should be clearly intimated that Government will rigidly act up to the spirit of the instructions they contain :— ' Para. 26.—The malpractices which it has been our painful duty to notice amons; the subordinate functionaries in the Government Offices at your Presidency, have been continued through so many years, and are of a character so injurious, both to the public interests, and to the reputation of the British Government, that you ought not to shrink from the exercise of any severity which may be necessary for their entire sup pression. Prosecution in a Criminal Court should be had recourse to when legal evidence can be obtained ; in any case, all persons either direct- l} 7 ^or indirectly concerned in the corrupt receipt of money, or in divulging the secrets of Government, or in the clandestine communication of official documents, or being even cognizant of such practices without bringing them to the notice of their superiors, should be dismissed from office, and their re-employment in any Department of the public service strictly interdicted. ' 27.—In cases where 'it may not be possible to fix the breach ot trust upon a particular individual, but where it may be ascertained that it has been committed in some branch of a Department, reluctant as we should I— i *• be to inflict injury on any who may be innocent, we should feel it our duty to dispense with the services of the whole body, rather than fail to reach the treacherous and corrupt members of it. \ i have the honor to be. Sir. Your most obedient servant, A. MALET, Chief Secretary.
