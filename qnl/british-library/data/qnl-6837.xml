Report of Sub-Coimnittoo a|)|&gt;oiiite(l under paragraph 17 of the Minutes of ^Ist March 1917. 1. W o have been directed to investigate the details of the division of work between the Indian and Mesopotamian services, and the ponrces ol recruitment for the latter. In order to carry ont these directions, we have found it necessary to consider senalnn the ' provisional recommendations embodied in the Alinntes of the 21st March 1917. ^ c submit the lollowing remarks Recommendations Xos. 1. and ■'&gt;. —Xo observations. X os. 4 and 6 — Umil* of liar/dad V dayet: question of the 11 ohf I'I aces.— AVo desire to lay stress on tin 1 importance of including in the intnre adminis trative area of the State or Province ol Hagdad all the land irrigated, or to bo irrigated, by the existing or future canal system of Mesopotamia. r l he Hindia barrage and the canals fed from it are in the neighbourhood of the Shia shrines, which it is proposed to treat as separate enclaves to bo excluded from British direct control. In delimiting the^e enclaves the objection to including in them any land fall'.ng within the limits of the canal system should be carefully borne in mind. We also consider that, whatever lorm oi separate administration is set up in the Bagdad \ ilayet, the control of irrigation in the two Vilayets (Bagdad and Basra) should be in the hands of a single authority. Xo. ').- Form of Arab Administration in Bagdad Vdaijet. — We Tinder- stand the present position to be that the '* Irak Code, which contains the law in force in the Basra Vilayet, extends automatically to all additional territory occupied since the code was introduced. W e consider that this code will not be found appropriate to the conditions oi tiie Bagdad \ ilayet if, as is contemplated, this territory is to be administered as far as possible on Arab lines. The right course, in our opinion, would be to maintain the local judicial system as far as possible, both in civil and criminal matters, and both as regards the substance of the law and the otlicial personnel, subject to such modifications in substance and in nomenclature as may bo found necessary {e.g., the Bubstitution of Arabic for Turkish otlicial titles, wherever the latter are in use). The same principle should be followed in constituting the executive Government and the machinery of administration. The existing land-revenue system should be left as far as possible undisturbed, while the tribal system of government, the provincial and local councils, and the old official organisation (Turks being replaced by Arabs) should be maintained. The policy of His Majesty's &lt; lovernment should be to administer the \ ilayet as an Arab province, so far as possible by indigenous agency and in accordance with existing laws and institutions, fn this way no insuper able obstacles would be created to its ultimate inclusion, under British control, in an Arab State or Confederacy; and the promises given in Sir Stanley Maude's proclamation would thus be made good. The employment of Indians in any branch of the administration of the \ ilayet is inconsistent with this policy, and should therefore be strictly discountenanced. No Asiatics from outside the Vilayet should be employed in the administration unless ol' Persian or Arab descent or domicile. In pursuance of the above policy, it would seem desirable to resuscitate, under British auspices, whatever may remain of the provincial and municipal councils that existed in the Vilayet under the Turkish regime. No. G.— See under No. I. No. 7.—No observations. No. 8. Headquarters of Government. —We consider that the title and place of residence of the Head of the Mesopotamian Administration must S :i5r. 25 a 17nanm _ depend to some extent on the future status of the Basra Vilayet. If that V ilayet does not become British territory, the importance of Bagdad as a capital city, and the probability that the affairs of the Bagdad Vilayet will Occupy the greater part of the time and attention of the Head of the Administration, point to locating him at Bagdad. A solution might be to place the Administration of the Basra Vila\et under a 'Governor' or 44 Deputy-Governor of Basra, subordinate to a ' High Commissioner,' with headquarters at Bagdad, whose authority would extend to the whole of Mesopotamia. But in the more likely event of the Basra Vilayet becoming British territory, there appear strong objections to such a solution. Apart from the anomaly of governing a British province (Basra) from headquarters situated in territory with a Jess clearly defined status, it could not but seriously impair the Arab 44 facade,' which is to be the basis of our policy as regards Bagdad. For if Basra is annexed and the Head of the Administration lor Basra and Bagdad enjoys the single title of 'High Commissioner for Mesopotamia, and has his oflicial headquarters at Bagdad, it is difficult to imagine that any such 'facade' can continue to exist or that the Arab mind will not consider the whole of Mesopotamia to have been annexed to Great i Britain. The solution proposed would be for the Chief of the Administration to he termed 'Governor of Basra and High Commissioner for Mesopotamia,' with his titular headquarters at Basra; although it would be understood that he would usually reside at Bagdad, where his most important duties 'would lie. It would be necessary for two oflicials to be available, one at i nisi a &lt;in(l one at Bagdad, to assist him and to replace him during absence. 1 hese officials might be called ' Deputy Governor of Basra ' and ' Deputv High Commissioner for Mesopotamia,' respectively. Ao. 1). Civil Serncr.—We see objection to the creation of a special Civil Service for Mesopotamia, on the ground that the cadre would be too small to be self-supporting, and that the number of prize appointments would be insufficient to attract candidates of the best stamp, \\ e would recommend the amalgamation of the Service with that of the Sudan, recruitment to both services being by the same method and the personnel interchangeable. Amalgamation with the Egyptian Civil Service might follow later. In the early stages it will probably be necessary to employ a number of militarv olhcers in various civil capacities. Officers from the Indian Services are also likely to be required, though it is difficult to estimate, even approximately, in what numbers. Such officers can be lent temporarilj-under the ' Foreign Service ' rules already in force Opportunity should also be given lo Indian olhcers, civil and military, now employed in Mesopotamia to volunteer for permanent transfer to the new Service. A os. 10-13.—Xo observations. Ao. 11. 11 est and South, (Joast of Persian (Inlf. —Certain aspects of the question appear to us to point to the desirability of placing the Arabian littoral of the rersian Gull under the political control of the Mesopotamian authorit ies rather than of the Government of India. The acquisition by Bin v and ol M llasa will necessarily bring under the control of the former the Arabian coast as far south as Bahrein. We understand, moreover, that the .overnment of India already experience considerable difficulty in staffing ilie posts in this region, owing to the limited number and value of the appointments available, which oiler little inducement to officers of the m mn I olitical Department to qualify themselves for service in Arabic- spea -mg districts. I his difficulty will be greatly increased by the removal V ;, ^ (la d i j'om the Indian sphere. A\ e recommend that the Government of I in I la should be consulted on this point with as little delay as possible, ai*i at, the absence of strong objection on their part, the question should be ieconsidered in the light of the above remarks. A o. 15. Aden and South ('oast of Arabia—We consider that the present opportunity should be taken to gratify the long -expressed desire of the Oovernmeni of India to be relieved of the charge of Aden and its depen- lencies. he political control of the Hadramaut and the South Arabian oMden 1(1 0f So( ' 0tra ^ sll0n H in our opinion, go with that A7o. 16.—No observations.bpeak .no- generally are of opinion that the administrative arranoe- ments introduced during tlie present military occupation into Mesopotamia as a whole should be consistent with the future policy of His Majesty 's / m :; ,nin 7 t - lie l ' ,asra ^ lla yet, il it is decided to administer it as British territory through the direct agency of British officials, will cause no special dittK nit}. I lie international position to be assigned to the Bagdad Vilayet will require careful consideration, and we have not examined in detail the possible alternatiye solutions of the problem; nor are we acquainted with ol Mis Majesty s Government on this point. But rou^hlv speaking, three alternative courses api)ear to be open, viz. ; ' ^ ' (1) I'o lease the province, if it is formally included in an Arab State or con literacy (.1 States, from the latter on the hasis of a lixed annual payment, in which case, from the point of view of mteniational aw the external eovereisnty would presumably be I.ritish, though the territory would not form part of (he Hritish I dominions. (2) To recognise the existence of the Bagdad State under a local ruler or local government, and to declare a British protectorate over it • and thereby, by the exclusion of external relations with foreign' owers, to assume, according to international law, the extenml sovereignty of the protected territory. The manner in which the internal sovereignty would be shared would be a matter of municipal arrangement, (3) To leave the full sovereignty, external and internal, with the contemplated Arab State, and to conclude with the latter a convention by which it should agree to follow the advice which His Majesty s (.overnment may tender as regards the form and the personnel of the internal administration. The distinction between j.S). and (1) and would be that under (1) ami i-i the conduct of foreign relations would exclusivelv vest in His Majesty s Government, whereas under (3) they would vest in the Arab State. I k undesnalulit} ol I Ins latter arrangement is obvious \Ve are disposed to think that it would be possible to provide a satisfactory administration, suitable to the requirements of the people on the general lines ol the system prevailing in Egypt, under which local aummistratiye work is carried on by native Mudirs under the miidance of iMiropean Inspectors. 'he various reform schemes proposed in the past for be administration of furkish provinces such as .Macedonia and Armenia might also serve as a convenient model. 3. 'We have not considered the question of the rnilitarv defence of Mesopotamia, or of the quarter from which the troops for this purpose are to be provided. 4 We would emphasise the importance of an early decision on the points raised above Any necessary reference to the Government of India or elsewhere should, in our opinion, be made bv telegraph with the least possdde delay.

From Viceroy, Foreign Department^ 20/7* March 1917. (liepeatcd to Sir I'. Cox.) Secret. Your telegram of the ITtli March. Civil Adiniiiistration of Bagdad. Although paramount direct British administration may not be contemplated it seems essential that apart from martial law which can merely maintain order steps should be taken to overhaul and replace defunct Turkish administration and to carry ou work of civil Departments. For this purpose we understand suitable Arab personnel is not immediately available, and that onus must fall for the time being at any rate on British Officers. The immediate requirements appear to be — (1) To secure submission by political means of tribes between Kut-el- Amara and our front line and later between Kut-el-Amara and Nasiriyah and settle them on accustomed lands on revenue paying basis. Latter is of course mostly in Basra \ ilayet, but we mention it to show full requirements. (2) To overhaul and replace civil Departments of Vilayet of Bagdad. Ford) a few military Assistant Political Ofiicers will be required and we propose to send such suitable Officers as are available from India. We have already sent Major Bailey of Political Department. May we use our discretion up to, say, eight more Ollicers ? For (2) an experienced Revenue Officer with a staff of two or three Ollicers acquainted with Arabic and if possible Turkish are required. If Dobbs is willing to return to Mesopotamia, and his health admits, we propose to send him. If not we propose Holme of Political Department. One or two Officers from Egypt or London would be useful in this capacity. Further we propose to send Holland on completion of Trade Report to Basra as Cox's deputy, Wilson moving up to Bagdad in similar, capacity.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000292_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/B254</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000292</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/B254</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'MESOPOTAMIAN ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE.
