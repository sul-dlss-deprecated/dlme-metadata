Since the English have consolidated their rule in Hindustan, they have taken good care that the Rajas and people of India should have no relations with any other country than England. Germany in accordance with the practice of the art of government made on its part no effort to establish relations with the Indian states. England, France and Russia - these three enemies - by the mercy of God have suffered great loss from the war which they started without consideration of right and wrong; and His Highness’s righteous friends Germany, Austria- Hungary and Turkey have gained incalculable victory. And by reason of this war Germany has now obtained an opportunity to display its goodwill towards His Highness. For even here we have heard the renown of His Highness* pcitriotism and wisdom, and it is for that reason that I venture to write to His Highness this letter. I am epnfidert that His Highness will make every effort in his power for the welfare of India. The English (Imperial) Government at thi s© this time has had to collect its whole strength outside India in Europe, Asia and Africa to meet its painful straits, and ^byP'k anc ^ -Persia, are on the point of deliverance from the bondage of England and Russia.. I have full confidence that His Highness will drive with body, mind, and wealth to obtain the independence of India and establish it in its proper status in the world. In that the German (Imperial) Govern ment and our friends will in all ways give satisfactory and affectionate assistance. Germany, Austria-Hungary and Turkey by reason of their might in arms and resources are able certain^ to win this war in the end and to secure victory also for all their comrade friends. This war must not end till England has been rendered incapable of maintain ing its own economic polity by means of the loot of conquered nations. As for the lies about us that our enemies for a long while have been spreading, contrary to them the truth is this that Germany has never made any effort to establish its rule in Asia. Germany is delighted at every endeavour that is made for the independence of all the nations of Asia. This attitude is in accordance with our traditions, our usage, our foreign policy, and the national arrangements of our country. Germany always does and will work honestly in accordance with these practices. It is not the desire of Germany and our friends to interfere in any way in the internal arrangements of Indian independence. Germany, Austria-Hungary and Turkey will recognize the future Indian ImperialImperial Government as a kingdom on an equality with themselves and will maintain political and economic relations with it. -*r Since His Highness’s interest and ours are one, v/e regard His Highness as our fellow combatant in war against the imperial might of England and we offer our congratula tions.7ERY SECRET. EXTRACT FROM STATEMENT MADE BY A BRITISH AGENT. I was with Baron Wesendonk from 9 o’clock at night until 2 the next morning. He gave me a good deal of general information. He spoke about the prisoners in Turkey and Germany. He said that the Germans were treating the prisoners well, but those in Turkey were suffering a good deal; that of the 13,000 prisoners taken at Kut-el-Amara, quite a number of the English had died. Three thousand of the British troops were employed in making a railway near Mount Taurus, .and seven thousand Mohammedans and three thousand Hindoos were working between Aleppo and Konia on the new railway to Egypt. He said that the Mohammedams were well treated by the Turks, but that they did not treat the Hindoos very well. He suggested that the Indians should form a relief committee to send something to the prisoners in Turkey. I promised to do what I could in this matter. Then he told me:- Aghaieff, a great Russian Tartar is working on a pan- Tartar movement in Turkey, the object of which is to eliminate as far as possible all Arabia and Persian influences from their national literature. Through his influence the Turkish Government have greatly developed the education of women. The scope of his endeavour extends from Turkey, through the northern parts of Persia, Russian Turkestan, Chinese Turkestan, Mongolia, and right up to Japan. The idea being to persuade the Japanese that they belong to the same Tartar race as the Turks. A^iaieff is in Constantinople, there he is publishing a vast amount of Turkish literature on the subjectsubject which is being distributed throughout these countries. Arbab Jemshed, a Zoroastrian,, and a member of the Bahai Sect is a very prominent member of the Persian Parliament, and is using his influence as a co-religionist with the Iranis in Bombay. He is one of the chief merchants in the province of Yezd, Persia, and is completely under German influence. His commercial connection brings him into touch with Bombay, and it may be in this way that he is using his influence on behalf of the German Government. Farid Bey is a well known Egyptian Nationalist leader, and has gone back to Berlin. There is a certain amount of bitterness between the various Egyptian parties in Switzerland Baron Wesendonk told me that the Egyptians would never accomplish anything as their leaders were so much at variance. Farid Bey is an out and out nationalist who says, 'Egypt for the Egyptians”, whereas the ex-Khedive is playing more for his own hand. The young Turks support the claims of the Grand. Vizier in the event of the Turks taking Egypt. The ex-Khedive who is in Switzerland at the moment goes under the name of Negropontis. Baron Yesendonk also spoke to me about various Turkish Officers, and mentioned the following names:- JAMAL PASHA, TALAAT BEY and ENVER PASHA. He said that the Turkish leaders had lost the respect they formerly had for the Germans* This change of attitude was due to the high opinion expressed in the English papers regarding the chivalry and fair fighting of the Turks, which they threw in thefaces of the (German Officers when they met them in the streets of Constantinople. Since the recent military successes of the Turks, they havehave been puffed up with the idea of a pan-Islamic conquest of the world, from Spain to China, and from Constantinople to Java, This idea has been started by the Indian Mohammedans in Turkey, who were however considered by the Germans to be of little consequence. The Turks are anxious to enlist the sympathy of Mohammedans in India, and are even willing to make grants of land in Mesopotamia to the extent of fifty acres per man and monetary assistance. % Baron Wesendonk further told me that the Germans thought nothing of the Arab revolt, as the present Sheikh-ul-Islam is pro-German, and has issued a fatwa. creating a new Sheriff of Mecca, also that, - Owing to the threatened rupture of relations between Germany and Turkey, and in order to counteract the anti-German influences at Constantinople, especially the headstrong policy of ENVER PASHA, it was very necessary to have a really influential Mohammedan from India. He then asked me if I knew such a person, to whom they were very willing to give a subsidy, or even landed property in Turkey if they could get the right class of man, so that he could influence the Turkish high officials in favour of Germany. I said that I would try. Baron Wesendonk said that he must be a man of a prominent family, who had already taken some part in the national political life. He asked me if I thought the Hon. Mr.JINNAH would be of any use. I replied that he would not be of very much use, because he was a follower of the Aga Khan. Jinnah’s brother is now in Zurich, and they are very keen to smuggle him into Germany. They told me that if I could get such a man I was to bring him back to London first in order to disarm suspicion, and then smuggle him through France into Switzerland andand, thence into Germany. They promised to pay all his expenses. The Indian Committee stationed at Berlin looks after all Indian Prison Camps in Turkey, and arranges for their food and other requirements. A large number of Mohammedan prisoners of war asked the Turkish Authorities to be allowed to see the Sultan. This request was conveyed to ENVER PASHA, and he arranged that the prisoners should line up in the streets of Constantinople, to see the Sultan on a Friday as he was on his way to the Mosqu§. The Sultan noticed these prisoners, and asked the officials attached to his Suite to give them some food at the palace. Von V/esendonk told me that these Indian prisoners after having accepted the hospitality of the Sultan, expressed their sorrow at having to fight the Caliph of Islam. Then they evidently regretted having taken food from the palace and thought they would be punished on their return to India. Von Wesendonk said he was astonished that they should change their opinions so soon. He expressed the opinion that if Von der Goltz had lived they would surely have knocked at the gates of India. ******** Von Wesendonk also told me that the Persian Government was now at Kermanshah under the protection of the German Flag. The Governor of Luristhan appears to have issued a proclamation to the inhabitants of his provime ordering them to protect the country against the English and the Russians. He said the Germans had made preparations for the winter campaign in the East, the Turks and the Germans against Eg/pt, which was to be attacked from three sides; the 4th Turkish . ArmyITArray Corps with Gsrraans to attack from th© northj the Senussi Irioe j. rora the Test, and the Sudanese and other Arab Tribes from the South. I may mention that I received information, though not from Von Wesendonk, that two Emissaries who had been sent to Abyssinia, via Yemen had been captured and murdered by the British troops. In addition to the attacks on Egypt, the Turks and Germans intend to attack simultaneously the British forces in Liesopotamia, and the Turks and Persians the Russians forces in the Caucasus. For the expedition to Egypt, I understand that guns and munitions have been buried at various points in the sand on the route to the Canal. As regards the proposed Caucasian campaign, the railway is now nearing completion. Von Wesendonk went on to tell me that a mission had gone to Kabul. It was composed of the following members , T The head of the mission was Lieutenant Von HENJJGr, whose father holds a prominent official position in Berlin. . KUMAR MAHENDRA PARTAB SINGH and MAULVI BARKATULLAH accompanied him together with six Turkish officers, and some Pathan prisoners. They took an autographed letter from the Kaiser to the AMIR of KABUL asking the Afghans to join the Germans against the English. Von Hentig was a personal friend of Von Wesendonks, and so anxious was he that he should return safely, that he even asked me if I would go to Kashgar, to get news of him. I asked him why his friend was in Kashgar, when he had gone to Kabul, and he replied that the Amir has said that he could not join in until the Germans and the Turks had kicked the Russians out\ out of Persia, so that Von Hendig had to await events in a neutral country* Von Wesendonk told me that there were six Austrian officers disguised as Turks in the Artillery of the Amir’s Amy, and a large number of Turkish officers in the same branch of his army. A Russian paper had already made a remark to this effect, but it was not known how they had got the info mat ion. Von Wesendonk said that the mission had really gone to NAS&amp;RULLAH KHAN, but in case the heir apparent was not able \ to do all that was necessary, they were keeping in with the Amir. The conrnunication with Kabul and India appears to be done through RAFIK MUHAIILAD KHAN of Nabha whose uncle seems to be a high official at Kabul. I was told to communicate with the above man who would help me to get into touch with Kabul. They seem to have little or no communication now with Kabul, therefore they asked me, if I could possibly see the German Officer Von Hendig on my return journey, to report to 7 them what the mission had accomplished. ******** Dutt said that they were anxious to remove the present Prime Minister of Nepal, - CHANDRA SHAMSHER JUNG on account of his pro-British sympathies, and to replace him by his brother, the late Prime Minister and Commander in Chief, - DEB SHAMSHER JUNG. Dutt suggested that I should see other members of the family, BIR SHAMSHER JUNG and JAUR JUNG with a view to enlisting their sympathies against the Prime I inister. *-* * * * * ** Dutt mentioned that a fatwa had been issued conjointly by the Sheikh - ul - Islam and the Chiefof the Senussi Tribe addressedaddressed to the NIZAM of HYDERABAD and his Mohammedan subjects. This proclamation was transmitted to the Nizam through the Sultan of Muscat, who himself is a feudatory of the Court of Hyderabad. ******** With Hyder v/hom I only saw on one occasion was PRINCE MENON, the son of the Maharajah of Cochin. This man kept entirely silent throughout the evening, and I was totally unable to ascertain what views he held, though I made several attempts in this direction. Menon was released from Germany through the intervention of the Pope, who had been requested to use his influence, by one of the Archbishops in Southern India who had been approached by the Maharajah of Cochin. Baron Wesendonk released Prince henon, but was very disgusted that Menon instead of gDing back to India to carry some messages which hedhad given him to take there, vas lounging about Switzerland. . . ********(COPY), io - - The Secretary to the Government of India in one Foreign &amp; Political Department,Simla. ho.44-F.

Time is approaching when Sistan harvest will be reaped and it is necessary to make fresh contracts for supplies soon. Arrangements made last year failed utterly in that when I called upon troops to move from Sistan delay entailed in moving owing to shortage of supplies and transport was to say the least of it dangerous.

Of course your co-operation would be necessary, but under proposed arrangement you would doubtless be relieved of a considerable burden. (3) Telegram No. 5298-3 (Q. M. G.), dated the 18th April 1916. From—The General Officer Commanding, 4th (Quetta) Division, Quetta, To The Quartermaster-General, Simla. General Officer Commanding Troops, Sistan, has been telegraphing recently regarding difficulties concerning local contracts out there for providing bAoosa and barley for horses and camels and he complains that shortages of stocks of these articles of supply have been hampering his mobility and his plans. Supplies for men have been sent periodically from Quetta and no difficulties have arisen regard ing rations for men. In his last telegram he states as follows. Begins. Present ciwinn regarding grain has arisen from fact that gram has not been obtainable in sufficient quantities to enable stocks to be collected for the movement of troops. The Consul Sistan insisted that the matter of contracts should be pub unreservedly ^ his bonds and be permitted no interference whatever, otherwise he refused to deal w th the mat J at all. The position therefore should be clearly defined before the next contracts are entered upon. Consul refuses to permit rates to be raised bevond a certain point. Ends. Gram and forage in considerable amounts have been despatched from Quetta to Robat to meet urgent demands and to make un shortages in these items due to partial failure of contracts made last year by aL qn This has added greatly to our camel difficulties and approximate- Consu , , five haye t0 p e a aded on to the cost of every maund carried ly rupee Hobat The new harvest in Sistan is due to be reaped from first f C Q rhave recently Jormed General Dyer that it is quite impossible to con- ! v* ^ qiitvoIv further consignments of bhoosa or barley from Quetta and it tmue to a most wasteful arrangement and the thousands of camels appears o forthcoming.

Such contracts should enable him to collect stocks at any points required by General Dyer to ensure him some mobility and freedom of action. At this distance I am unable to judge of the relative importance of rates nor to estimate any other local political factors which may be involved but the frequent complaints received latterly led me to believe that a lack of sufficient stocks of forage and grain for animals is having a detrimental effect on the operations out there. I understand that the difficulties of Consul, Sistan are connected with Persian revenue officials in estimations of Persian Govern ment shares of crops. I recognise that the intervention of C onsul, Sistan, in the matter of drawing up local contracts and his help in seeing these aie carried out appears to be essential for a successful outcome and I ha\ e insisted on this in my telegrams to General Officer Commanding troops, Sistan.

If our advice is listened to it will continue doing so. Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan has just been informed that a proposal to send grain here from Kharan is gladly welcomed by me.

Has your 193-X been written alter perusal of my 142-C ? \ou are 1 think unaware that in years prior to entry of column into Persia our Indian contractors hardly ever succeeded in delivering the small quantity of supplies for Kacha without invoking frequent assistance and intervention of this Consulate.^ How can you expect either Indian firm to collect three-fifteenths of total produce of Sistan for your troops without assistance of British Civil and Persian authorities ? You must remember that in any case I have to acquire about another qgfv^-fifteenths for levies and Consulate. Arrangements failed this year for simple reasons :— ( 1 ) that both Indian contractors swore that they had large supplies in hand for the respective contracts for which they tendered, and when they after wards said that they had no more grain we for a long time would not believe them, ( 2 ) that Persian authorities and our own military report stated that there wa£ sufficient grain in country, and we consequently did not realize seriousness of situation, ( 3 ) that much grain was exported to Afghanistan which we might have prevented if we had moved Persian authorities to action quicker. Now we know that the Indian contractors hold no stocks of grain and without Consulate assistance they will be utterly unable to collect one-quatter of your requirements. At present Mahan Singh is working for Consulate on exactly same terms as for troops, namely he takes over, cleans and delivers all grain supplied through Persian authorities and Consulate.

I consider that Mahan Singh has done very well upto now. If you think that he will do better if his remuneration is slightly increased, I shall not object, though in such circum stances the additional charge will equally fall on my men. If you are not content to rely on my judgment alone I suggest that you appoint a committee of two officers who will consult Major Heron and myself and so dispose of the business. 1 do not think that you should leave so large a question to the decision of a sub conductor. I also deprecate putting an officer on the committee who thinks that m time of war it does not matter one jot what rates are paid to contractors In conclusion I must say that no steps re contract can be taken until we hear from Tehran what the Revenue Department’s rates are. In past years we have always settled the Racha contract m June, July or even August owing to the dilatoriness of the Persian Government. I have arranged this year with Revenue Director simply to take over his grain of the new crop on a receipt, leaving price to be paid after settlement of the rates in Tehran. ^ Enclosure No. 3.

June, supplies would be brought by con tractors on their own transport to various supply depots. If this is carried out, the arrangement will be very satisfactory, but last year it was found necessary to collect supplies from district with Government camels, and this led to shortage of transport. I hope this will not be necessary this year. I think in any case if motor road is made and Quetta helps largely with motor lorries, all will be well; otherwise I am still of opinion that many more camels will be required. Troops at Khwash are now on reduced rations, and horses on half rations, but new contracts may remedy this.

I have the honour to forward herewith certain information which I was able to obtain from Dr. Rudolf Biach, Austrian prisoner of war, whilst accompanying him from Bandar Abbas to Karachi. 2 Dr. RUDOLF BIACH, AUSTRIAN. Personal details. (A&gt; V l A Height about 5 '- 9 ', thin, sharp-featured, dark hair, pointed beard and wears strong glasses. Eyes blue-grey, much sunburnt and has rather prominent ears. Walks with slight stoop ; teeth extensively stopped with gold. Age from 30 to 35. Doctor of Arts and Political Science, graduate of Vienna University, spent some months at Oxford and in London. Good family and rich, personal friend of Counts Mensdorff and Berchtold. Has not served in Austrian Army. Has mother and sister living in Vienna, latter married to Captain in Austrian Army who was wounded during the war, recovered and returned to the front. No brotners. Had letters of introduction to Sir P. Sykes from Dr. Dietz of \ ienna, also intro duction to Sir Walter Townley. Has travelled in the Cameroons and Sudan and extensively in Europe. Has received no letters from Austria for over 8 months. Movements immediately before and after the outbreak of war. In May 1914, acting on the advice of the Austrian Foreign Office, proceeded to London to endeavour to obtain information regarding a projected journey to Afghanistan for scientific purposes on behalf of the Vienna University and Museum. Arrived in Tehran about the end of June or beginning of July 1914, and was there on the outbreak of war. Asked by German authorities to join movement, but declined, wished to return with his Secretary to Austria but was prevented by the Austrian Minister. (Secretary was eventually sent back from Kerman.) Travelled down to Ispahan carrying on his scientific work, wdiich consisted of taking cinema pictures of tribal dances and phonograph records of tribal dialects. Came in contact with Dr. Pugin in Ispahan. From Ispahan proceeded to Yazd, where ^he finally joined the Germans in the hope of getting through to Afghanistan. From Yazd to Kerman, where he joined Zugmeyer. Sent down to Persian Baluchistan to endeavour to negotiate with the Chiefs in British and Persian territory. Arrived in Bampur last February with Wedig (a sergeant in the German Arm}, orderly to Prince Henry of Reuss). Was refused camels for hire by Bahram Khan, vffio forced to buy at the rate of 200 tumans (£40) each, and bad animals at that. Practically forced to leave Bampur and looted en route, losing nearly everything. Rejoined Zugmeyer north of Bam and while the party was trying to get through to Shiraz it was attacked near Baft by Bakhtiaris.

Expenses whilst in Baluchistan amounted to about £250 a week. Party realised that their position was hopeless when they heard that Kerman- shah had been captured, which news did not reach them until about a month after it occurred. Stated that majority of Germans were working like gentlemen,” but others including Wassmuss, Kardorff and Pugin were regarded by the majority as un civilised ” and not possessing “ culture.” Did not like the work and disagreed with German methods as employed by some members of the parties. Glad to have been made prisoner by the British as he had experienced three weeks in the hands of the Bakhtiaris. Party had not received any news of the war or of what was happening elsewhere in Persia for two months. Information obtained from Rudolf Biach. 1 .—German Parties. &amp; (а) Under Captain Neidermayer, who was in command of the whole move ment towards Afghanistan. This party consisted of:— Neidermayer, / Dr. Becker, Voigt, and three or four others. A total of five Germans reached Afghanistan. Dr. Becker did not get through, (б) Under Seiler, and consisting of:— Zugmeyer. Bohnstorfi. Griesinger. Biach. Wedig. This party seems to have split into two sections at Kerman ; one headed by Zugmeyer with Biach and Wedig proceeded towards Baluchistan; the other, led by Seiler with Bohnstorfi and Greisinger, endeavoured to get to Afghanistan. (c) Under Paschen, working towards Afghanistan via Khabis. Only name obtained was that of Fasting in this party. (d) Under Major Klein. Composition not known. Working from the north towards Ahwaz, Captain Neidermayer .—In command of all parties operating in Persia towards- Afghanistan. Cruel and unscrupulous, admired for his courage but cordially hated. Said to have forced most of his party to become circumcised and had no qualms about sacrificing lives for the benefit of his endeavours. Held views untenable* by the others. When captured in Afghanistan, managed to communicate twice with the others in Persia, but nothing has been heard of those in Kabul for many months. This has caused disagreement amongst the leaders and disorganisation has resulted. Zugmeyer .—Professor of Arts. Anglophile. Was in charge of mission to. Baluchistan. Did not proceed further than three stages north of Bam. Sent Biach on to Bampur to prepare the way. Sufiers from heart disease..3 Had 200,000 tumans (£40,000) in cash when he left Kerman. Was much astonished and rather upset at departure of British colony from Kerman. Offered assistance to colony. Dr. Becker. —Wounded in France, captured by French, exchanged and ultimately sent to Persia where he was captured by Russians near Tabriz, escaped, captured twice by robbers and severely wounded once. Proceeded to Darab to bribe Baharlus. Accompained Neidermayer towards Afghanistan and was left in charge of caravan with baggage and presents while others pushed on. Attacked and escaped back to Kerman. Present whereabouts not known. Kardorff. —Turkish Ambassador’s took A coward and hated by the re mainder of the Germans in Persia. A man of low breeding and principles. | Bohnstorff. —Had a large quantity of money when he left Kerman. Wassmuss. —Regarded as mad. Has turned Mussalman. Cannot return to Germany owing to having directly disobeyed orders in — (l) proceeding to Shiraz via Bandar Rig, and (2) attacking Bushire. None of the other Germans will have anything to do with him as he is not considered normal either as to sanity or morality. Disgusting acts took place in the Shiraz Consulate whislt he was there and all the others refused to accompany him to Tangistan. Yoigt. —Reached Afghanistan wih Neidermayer. A Hamburg-American Line officer. Much tattooed. Dr. Biach considered that the man sent in to Chahbar by Islam Khan was very likely Yoigt. He was of opinion that every endeavour would be made by Neidermayer to communicate with the remainder and expressed surprise that not one of them had escaped from Afghanistan to bring them orders. Fasting.—X young man of about 21 years of age and clever wireless operator. Acted as wireless expert. Indians and others connected with the Germans. 4/ndis—Had a number of Afridis attached to the various parties who were deserters from the British and had come from Baghdad. Baud Khan. —Considered unreliable. Ajit Singh. —Not known under that name- Isphiandari. —A Parsi of Kerman who bought provisions for the party in Kerman. Fateh Muhammad.— as far as Bam by Biach but discharged there as bemg suspicious. His family was allowed 30 tumans (£6) a month. An Indian. —Name not known. Proceeded to India via Bushire and wrote letters from Bombay to party in Shiraz. Indians and others from America—Fourteen hundred Indians and others including Americans proceeded to India from America on the outbreak of war to enhance sedition. Turks.—No Turks were working with the Baluchistan party. Germans very angry with the Turks because the latter stopped all their machine guns from enter ing Persia, also a large sum of money which they seized. Sardar Zafar.—RM entirely responsible by the Germans for the evacuation of Kerman by the British colony. Distrusted by the Germans and considered an ordinary robber. Zargham-us-Sultaneh. —When visited by Biach he volunteered to attack Bandar j Abbas forthwitth, and do anything for the German cause. ( Bahram /Oun.—Apparently tried to make Biach responsible in the eyes of the Baluch Sardars for the capture of Bampur fort. Has camels marked D Com-4 pany ” and several British Indian deserters who are still wearing their uniforms. Refused to forward a letter from Biach to Khalifah Khair Muhammad. Islam A7«m.—Approached Biach by letter and opened up negotiations with him. Said he was unable to cut the telegraph line himself but would get Khalifab Khair Muhammad to do it, and it was done. Nusrat-ul-MM. —German agent at Bam. Acted as forwarding agent for telegrams and letters. Nawab Khan Bahmari. —Showed friendship towards Biach but offered little assistance. Persian Balueh Sardars. —Islam Khan was the only Chief who would enter into ; any negotiations with Biach. Machine guns, rifles and ammunition. Machine guns. —None with the Southern Persian parties. Biach’s instru ments were taken by the Persians as machine guns and bombs. All machine guns * destined for these parties were seized by the Turks at Kermanshah. Rifles and ammunition. —Mostly German. Ammunition very poor. Wass- muss took a very large share of ammunition, about a million and a half rounds. The Baluchis have come to an end of all their ammunition and it was noticed that Bahrain Khan’s men were armed with Lee-Metfords. Money and Miscellaneous .—Germans have probably spent a million and a half sterling including that brought in by Marshal von der Goltz in Persia. Wireless .—The whole installation is believed to be in Kerman. * Biach only knew of one set which was intended for Afghanistan. Received daily war news, heard our wireless working, but did not attempt to decipher it. Wireless has not been working for the last two or more months. Cost of attacks on Bushire. —Each attack cost about £6,000. Expected result of Afghanistan expedition. —It was confidently hoped that the Germans would be able to buy the Amir with gifts of large sums of money and a huge display of various kinds of presents. Afghanistan was to declare war on the Allies, with the hoped-for result that India would rise and the Afghans would occupy Turkistan while we were quelling the trouble in India. Our troops in Eastern Persia .—Very little was known of our dispositions and numbers, in fact Biach remarked that they could never trust their information and were working in the dark. Karachi, ^ E.

He said that all the Germans had been dismissed from Afghanistan by the Amir with a very clear answer that he would not assist onem. Before dismissing them he had sent for his brother and eldest son am asked them if they meant really to ooey him., pointing out that they were doing just the reverse and were under mining the foundations of their own kingiorn, and give them a warning. Then in their presence he announced to the Germans their order of dismissal.■» It is said that some of them have left in the direction of Maimana (Turkestan), others towards Kaniahar. As regards the Austrian prisoners who had escaped from the hands of the Russians, and also the seven Afridi deserters who came with the party to Kabul the Amir is detaining them, in Kabul. This information is corroborated in its main details from another source. The difference in treatment of the German party on one side and the Austrians and Afridis on the other is said to be because the former came to Afghanistan as ambassadors, while the latter, being deserters, had to be detained by the Amir in accordance with his promises to the British Government. They are now beingbeing treated far more like prisoners than guests ana are looked down on and are no longer called 'mehman'. The German party left Kabul on Monday, May 22nd. There were about 15 real Germans, the rest of the party, to the number of about 60 or 70, being Turks or Persians. The Austrians, Afridis, etc., who are being detained, also number about 60 or 70.

Grant, 0.1.1., O.I.E., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla. Sir, I have the honour to attach a report on Dr. Bfiach by Major Howell. 2. He was apparently in Persia before the War broke out and % told me thct Dr. Dietz of Vienna (who with Lieutenant 0. Niedermeyer had stayed with me at Meshed in the summer of 1913,) had recommended him to visit me. He was swept into the German service while at Teheran and promised an Iron Gross. 3. His only important Mission was to Bahrain Khan. He met the Sirdar at Fahraj and soon realised that he was in danger. Bahrain Khan would not hire him camels, but sold hii a few bad ones at a very high price. He also, for a high price, gave him an escort for a few miles. Near Sardagha some fifteen miles North-West of Fahraj his Escort left and he was attacked by some of Bahrain Khan f s men on riding camels. He and his German Sergeant escaped through being mounted on horses. They finally reached Dalghun near Kalanzahu (to the West of Bampur) via Chah Shur and were helpedhelped by llawab Khan Baniari. They then returned to Ban by a direct road. 4. Dr. Biach is a student, the author of a book on the East India Company, and he hopes to be allowed to pursue his studies while a prisoner. From our point of view I can hardly conceive a better man to deal with Bahram Khan, than this Austrian scholar. I have, etc., Sd. P. L. Sykes, Brigadier-General, Inspector General, South Persia Military Police, Bunder Abbas. aRecord of an Interview with Dr. Rudolf B/iach on the 1st Lay 1916. Rudolf B/iach was brought in to KMMK&amp; G-eneral Sykes by Bakhtiari sowars in the employ of the Sirdar Zafar from Baft where he had remained on the break-up of his party. He reached Bandar Abbas about 6 p.m. on the first of Lay. E^iacd is a tall thin man, aged perhaps thirty, with dark hair, a short brown beard, and sharp keen features. He has bad sight and wears pince-nez glasses and his teeth, though regular and even, have been stopped with gold in many places. He bore traces of hardship, complained of the indignities to which he had been subjected, especially by Bahrain Khan, and later by the Bakhtiaris, and seemed very tired and glad to be out of the hands of orientals. B/iach is a well-educated man and speaks English very well. He is a graduate of Vienna University and has the degree of Doctor of Civil Law, and, appropriately enough. Political Science. He describes himself as rich and never went through his period of military service with the Austrian Army. Under instructions from G-eneral Sykes Byiach was admitted to parole, which was made temporary, to endure only until his arrival in British India. He appeared very ready to give his parole and disposed to talk with seeming frankness. In these circumstances it seemed better to refrain from any set and formal interrogation, as more could be got out of him by casual conversation. His position, as repFesented by himself, was singularly ill defined. He claimed to have military rank as an officer in the (reman Army, though an Austrian subject, and his pay was fixed at a thousand marks a month, out he could not say exactly what rank he had received. He seems to be one of those persons picked up by Zugmeyer on terms arranged locally. As Biach had a long talk with General Sykes on the ^nd Lay, it is not necessary for me to go into detail about nis account of his movements. It need only be set down that he complained •4.complained of the lack of discipline and co-ordination in these German missions, that he v?as very bitter against the Turks, who, he said, stopped en route all the money and machine guns intended for use in Persia; he also stated that his companions had been working with far smaller resources in the shape of money than they were generally supposed to possess. Gince the rfussian capture of Kennanshah they had all recognised that their position was hopeless, and none of them expected to get out of the country alive. Dr. Biach attributed his own preservation to the fact that he had pretended to be a doctor of medicine and had administered pills and potions freely to the Bakhtiaris, from which, he trusted, that they would never recover. He also said that some of his companions had 'gone too far' but could not or would not explain what he meant by that. I took it that the phrase referred to the murder of British officers by hired assassins. Sd. K. JJ. Howell, l.C.S. Hnd Kay 1916.

He had enlisted 300 men within the firtt month, and the new force appeared to be popular. He is accompanied to Kerman by an escort of half a battalion, a squadron and a section of mountain artillery. Aa soon as possible after his arrival at Kerman it is expected that Sir Percy Sykes will either go himself or arrange for a detachment at Shiraz in order to support barman Parma. The Jar Office has been able to provide 11 junior officers with Persian experience for the S.P.M.P. Senior officers will also be needed as the force will presumably expand to approximately lu,ooo f the figure fixed for the Persian Cossack Brigade in the North. The position on the Southern Baluchistan and Mekran border, which during the intrigues of the German parties operating eastwards from Bam, was one of anxiety, has now been improved by an agreement arrived at with the powerful Chief Bahrain Khan of Persian Baluchistan and other trans-frontier chieftains. Haids on any large scale are considered unlikely for some time. An escort of 200 rifles is being despatched to strengthen the Political Agent's escort in Mekran. The British forces in eastern Persia under General Dyer consist of 1 Regt.,. Cavalry. 1 Section Mountain artillery. 700 rifles. 6 machine guns. 200 Hazara levies (inhabitants of central Afghanistan). 630 Sistani levies (plus as many levies as Gen. Dyer is able to raise in Barhad). The above force is distributed as shown on the accompanying map, from Birjand to Muchki Chah, From Birjand northward through Meshed to Askhabad, there are Russian detachments which according to the latest news in our possession total some 1200 sabres only.only, General Dyer, Commanding in Seistan # moved south to Vasht at the beginning of April to punish the Damanis and other iiarhaddi tribes under Jahind and Juma Khan *ho had not only raided our communioations with India on the Nushki road* but were suspected of assisting German movements* and especially of facilitating the * entry of German officers into Afghanistan. The two chiefs submitted after a small action on the 13th April. No more trouble is to be anticipated at present on this border. On the 13th and 14th April detachments of a few regular troops and levies had engagements with tribal forces in the direction of Nasratabad 3ipi which though successful on the whole, demonstrated the unreliability of levies of this description without a sufficiency of training and British officers. The Amir has succeeded in getting rid of the Gerraan-Turkish liission in Kabul, the members of which are reported to have left in two parties, one for .asar-i- Sherif on the Hubs lan frontier, and the other for Kandahar. It is difficult to soo how they expect to reach home. This event tends to confirm the /iceroy*s opinion that in spite of the exhilaration caused in ^abul by what is deemed an Islamic victory at Kut el Amara, no real adverse effect has been produced on the situation in Afghanistan, where the Amir 1 s decision to maintain neutrality has apparently been accepted.t&gt;. Conclusion. To sum up, the situation in Persia, a country which should he the fire-proof screen between the Uerroan-Turkish blaze and the Afghan powder-magazine, has improved very greatly within the past three months. It may now safely be said that with the Russian advance to Kasr-i-ohirin and Isfahan, and the consequent severance of the communications of the German-Turkish parties in Persia and Afghanistan, the fire-proof screen has been restored to efficiency. Assuming that the Russians and ourselves are able roughly to maintain our present positions between Lake Urmieh and the head of the Persian Gulf, it should merely be a matter of time before the smouldering embers of fanatical pro Turkish sentiment in Afghanistan and political unrest in Persia die out in the first case, and are stamped out, it is hoped by energetic British action in the latter. The improvement in the general situation and in northern, western and central Persia has been brought about by the vigorous Russian military action and by that alone. Vhere there has been improvement in the British sphere it is directly traceable to the effects of that action, and has only manifested itself where energetic and decided military measures (such as the landing of Sir P.Syke’s mission, and General Dyer’s expedition) as opposed to political bargaining have been employed. This will invariably be found to be the case in Persia where very small forces if well armed md boldly handled are able to subdue large tracts of country, but where political engagements are of no value (Ggd.)

Had letters of introduction to Sir P. Sykes from Dr. Dietz of Vienna, also introduction to Sir 'Walter Townley. Has travelled in the Cameroons and Sudan and extensively in Europe. Has received no lett s from Austria for over 8 months. Movements immediately before and after the outbreak of war. In May, 1914, acting on the advice of the Austrian Foreign Office, proceed ed to London to endeavour to obtain information regarding a projected journey to Afghanistan for scientific purposes on behalf of the Vienna University and M useum. Arrived in Tehran about the end of June or beginning of July, 1914, and was there on the outbreak of war. Asked by German authorities to join movement, but declined, wished to return with* his Secretary to Austria but was prevented by the Austrian Minister. (Secretary was eventually sent back from Kirman.) Travelled down to Isfahan carrying on his scientific work, which consisted of taking cinema pictures of tribal dances and phonograph records of tribal dialects. Came in contact with Dr. Pugin in Isfahan. From Isfahan proceeded to Yazd, where he finally joined the Germans in the hope of getting through to Afghanistan. From Yazd to Kirman, where he joined Zugmeyer. Sent down to Persian Baluchistan to endeavour to negotiate with the Chiefs in British and Persian territory. Arrived in Bampur last February with Wedig (a sergeant in the German Army, orderly to Prince Henry of Beuss). Was refused camels for hire by Bahram Khan, who forced him to buy at the rate of 200 tumans (£40) each, and bad animals at that. Practically forced to leave Bampur and looted en route, losing nearly everything. Rejoined Zugmeyer north of Bam and while the whole party was trying to get through to Shiraz it was attacked near Baft by Bakhtians. Zugmeyer, Wedig and Griesinger escaped. Expenses whilst in Baluchistan amounted to about £250 a week. 493GSB 1Party realised that their position was hopeless when they heard that Kirman- shah had been captured, which news did not reach them until about a month after it occurred. Stated that maiority ot Germans were working like “ gentlemen ”, hut others including Wasstnus's, Kardorll and Pugin were regarded by the majority as ' unciyilised ” and not possessing 11 culture • Did not like the work and disagreed with German methods as employed by some members of tbe parties. Glad to have been made prisoner by tbe British as be had experienced 3 weeks in the bands of the Bakhtiaris. Party bad not received any news of the war or of what was happening else where in Persia for two months. Information obtained from Rudolf Biach. 1 .— German Parties. (a) Under Captain Neidermayer, who was in command of the whole movement towards Afghanistan. This party consisted of :— Neidermayer, Ur. Becker, Voigt, and three or four others. A total of five Germans reached Afghanistan. Ur. Becker did not get through. (b) Under Seiler, and consisting of :— Zugmeyer. Bohnstorff. Griesinger. Biach. Wedig. This party seems to have split into two sections at Kirman ; one headed by Zugmeyer with Biach and Wedig proceeded towards Baluchistan ; the other, led by Seiler with Bohnstorff and Greisinger endeavoured to get to Afghanistan. (c) Under Paschen, working towards Afghanistan via Khabis. Only name obtained was that of Pasting in this party. (d) Under Major Klein. Composition not known. Working from the north towards Ahwaz. Captain Neidermayer. —In command of all parties operating in Persia towards Afghanistan. Cruel and unscrupulous, admired for his courage but cordially hated. Said to have forced most of his party to become circumcised and had no qualms about sacrificing lives for the benefit of his endeavours. Held views untenable by the others. When captured in Afghanistan, managed to communicate twice with the others in Persia, but nothing has been heard of those in Kabul for many months. This has caused disagreement amongst the leaders and disorganisation has resulted. Zugmeyer. —Professor of Arts. Anglophile. Was in charge of mission to Baluchistan. Uid not proceed furthe*? than three stages north of Bam. Sent Biach on to Bampur to prepare the way. Suffers from heart disease. Had 200,000 tumans (£40,000) in cash when he left Kirman.

A coward and hated by the remainder ot the Germans in Persia. A man of low breeding and principles. SaAnsfor/.—Had a large quantity of money when be left Kirman. Wasamustt. —Regarded as mad. Has turned Mussalman. Cannot return to Germany owing to having directly disobeyed orders in— (1) proceeding to Shiraz via Bandar Rig, and (2) Attacking Bushira. None of the other Germans will have anything to do with him as he is not considered normal either as to sanity or morality. Disgusting acts took place in the Shiraz Consulate whilst he was there, and all the others refused to accompany him to Tangistan. Voigt, —Reached Afghanistan with Neidermayer. A Ilamburg-AmerB can Line officer. Much tattooed. Dr. Biach considered that the man sent in to Chahbar by Islam Khan was very likely Voigt. He was of opinion that every endeavour would be ma le by Neidermayer to communioate with the remainder and expressed surprise that not one of them had escaped from Afghanistan to bring them orders. Fasting. —A young man of about 21 years of age and clover wireless operator. Acted as wireless expert. Indio ns and others connected with the Germans. Afridis. —Had a number of Afridis attached to the various parties who were deserters from the British and had come from Baghdad. Daud Considered unreliable. A jit Singh.—Rot known under that name. Isphia?idari.—A Parsi of Kirman who bought provisions for the party in Kirman. Fateh Muhammad.— as far as Bam by Biach but discharged there as being suspicious. His family was allowed 30 tumans (£G) a month. An Indian. —Name not known. Proceeded to India via Bushire and wrote letters from Bombay to party in Shiraz. Indians and others from America —Fourteen hundred ludians^antl others including Americans proceeded to India from America on e war to enhance sedition. , ^ , i • , _ rjnrmnnQ Turks— Ao Turks were working with the Baluchistan j) 7- very angry with the Turks because the latter stopped all their maehme gu from entering Persia, also a large sum of money which they seized. bardar Zafar.-UeU entirely responsible by the Germans for the evacuation. of Kirman by the British colony.

Said be was unable to cut the telegraph line himselt but would get Kbalifah Khair Muhammad to do it, and it was done. Nnsrat-ul-Mulk.—German agent at Bam. Acted as forwarding agent for telegrams and letters. Ncewab Khan Showed friendship towards Biach but offered little assistance. Persian BaUch Sardar^.-l^m Khan was the only Chief who would enter into any negotiations with Biach. Machine guns, rifles and ammunition. Machine guns. —None with the southern Persian parties. Biach's instru ments were taken by the Persians as machine guns and bombs. All machine guns destined for these parties were seized by the Turks at Kirmanshah. Hifles and ammunition. —Mostly German. Ammunition very poor. Wass- muss took a very large share of ammunition, about a million and a hall rounds. The Baluchis have come to an end of all them ammunition and it was noticed that Bahram Khan’s men were armed with Lee-Metfords. Money and Miscellaneous.—Germans have probably spent a million and a half sterling including that brought in by Marshal von der Goltz in 1 ersia. mreless.—Vhe whole installation is believed to he in Kirman. Biach only knew of one set which was intended for Afghanistan. Beceived daily war news, heard our wireless working but did not attempt to decipher it. Wireless has not been working for the last two or more months. Cost of attacks on Bushire. —Each attack cost about £6,000. Expected result of Afghanistan expedition.—It was confidently hoped ' that the Germans would be able to buy the Amir with gifts of large sums of money and a huge display of various kinds of presents. Afghanistan was to declare war on the Allies, with the hoped for result that India would rise and the Afghans would occupy Turkistan while we were quelling the trouble in India. Our troops in Eastern Persia.—Very little was known of our dispositions and numbers, in fact Biach remarked that they could never trust their informa tion and were working in the dark.
