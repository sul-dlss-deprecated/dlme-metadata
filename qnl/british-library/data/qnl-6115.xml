J. J'^acPherson, ^ice President and Resident Administrative Ofticer, The Arabian American Oil Company, Ehahran, ^audi Arabia, to the Hon'ble Lieut.-Col. L.R.Hay, CCI. , CIS., Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain. I regret that the Political Residency’s letter of December 18th, written by Mr. C.J. Felly to Kr. Lloyd Iloore, was misrouted after Lr. Loore transmitted it to us and an answer has been inadvertently delayed. Your letter asked whether the C-47 aircraft that landed at Kuwait on November 10th was not an Aramco plane and whet lie r the party of Americans were not Aramco employees. Inasmuch as this party later landed at Dhahran, we are in a position to inform you that the plane was a Saudi Arab Government plane. \.e had no part in its arrange ments. The party consisted of a group of Standard Oil of New Jersey executives who paid us a visit in the course of a tour of Kiddle Lastern operations. T,he writer happened to be in Basrah when this party arrived there. They had visited Kuwait (Kuwait Oil Company) and Abadan (Anglo Iranian Oil Company) and were enroute to Kirkuk to visit Iraq Petroleum Company. Your letter does call to our attention, however, two problems that have arisen in connection with trips to Kuwait. First, with regard to personnel clearances we have experienced in making occasional business trips to Kuwait to discuss mutual problems with the Kuwait Oil Company, or to pick up officials of the Kuwait Oil Company to visit our operations at their request. V. e have been told that visas for Kuwait cannot be obtained without writing a letter to Kuwait and obtaining a written reply. This procedure is inconsistent with practice elsewhere in the area where cabled approvals are considered satisfactory. We wonder whether we have been misinformed in this regard. On one occasion we attempted from Bahrain and Basrah to. obtain visas for a party of our executives to visit Kuwait, but at both places we were told it would take too long to obtain these visas. It was necessary for this party to return from Basrah over Kuwait to Dhahran, and then later to go to the time and expense of flying to Kuwait about ten days later to clear certain business vith the Kuwait Oil Company. We are wondering whether you would not be able to establish some procedure whereby visas for Kuwait could be obtained more quickly. Secondly, in regard to airplane clearances, the same general situation prevails. Our operations are expanding in the northern part of our concession area, and it is inevitable that, in addition to business trips with our planes, there will be times when we will be forced to make emergency landings at the Kuwait airfield for which plane clearances-have not been arranged in advance. Our present procedure in arranging plane clearances is to cable hr; Patrick of the Kuwait Oil Company to arrange clearance for our planes to land, he realise that this is not proper procedure, and we should like to be able to handle the matter in a more suitable way. We are wondering whether it would not be possible to record all of Aramco's aircraftaircraft v/ith the Kuwait Political Agency and obtain an annual clearance for landings at Kuwait. We are entirely agreeable to paying v/hatever landing charges might be applicable. In applying for this type of blanket clearance, I wish to assure you that we would be making landings at Kuwait only for the purpose of Company business, and not in the course of commercial air transport business or in connection with activitie not in keeping with normal good relations between two major oil companies.No.374-S Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain, the 26th February 1347. r / N u . t Thank you for your letter of February 1 st ih v.Iiich you informed me that the C -47 aircraft wiiich landeo. at Kuwait on November 10 th was a oaudi Arabian Government 'plane. me other points in your letter reouired re 1 erence to the Political Agent Kuv.'ait, hence the oelay in replying to you. . The information given to you that 'visas ior Kuwait cannot be obtained without writing a letter to Kuwait and obtaining a written reply', is not correct. Any British representative (e.g. Consul, Passport Olficer or Political Agent) empowered to grant at the re auept of the applicant to the Political Agent Kuv/ait inquiring v.’hether is any objection. If the Political Agent Kuwait sees no objection he will reply by telegram to that effect. In practice, in the case of travellers sponsored by your mmpany, all that the Political Agent has ordinarily to before signifying that there is no objection to their visit to Kuwait is to ensure that they have arranged lor accommodation there; an assurance in the telegram to him that they have done so should expedite his reply. As regards the blanket clearance you ask for lor Aramco 'planes, I should be glad if you could let me know where your 'planes are registered and the registered numbers of those for which you require the clearance.

Dear Sirs, Please refer to your letter No.C 58/3 dated the 22nd May, 1947.

W SubjectK\mait Air A;-reament ., , v) f \ l y Sir, I have the honour to refer to your telegram No.625 dated the 28th May, 1947 paragraph 3. 2. It seems certain that aircraft of many national ities will wish to land in Kuwait in the future : the Iraqi Airways service appears to be enjoying considerable success; and an Indian service is contemplated. There seems a possibility that Kuwait might become the starting point for pilgrimages by air to Mecca. Sooner or later the countries concerned may designate Kuwait as an airfield required foz’ international traffic. Should they do so the obligation to bring the airfield up to International standards would appear to rest upon hr eat Britain by virt e of her signature of the Chicago Convention on behalf of territories under protection. It does not seem that this obligation could be evaded by allowing our Air Agreement with the Shaikh to lapse. ' 3. Should we not renew the^Air Agreement and should we manage to divest ourselves of all obligations under International Air Conventions regarding Kuwait, cl dangerous vacuum might be left. The Shaikh desires that an airfield should be established, and might well receive favourably a proposal from a foreign state or air-line desiring an airfield under their own control. There is presumably no necessity to dilate dm the dangers inherent in such a possibility - the fact that His Majesty’s Government have concluded in the past exclusive air Agreements with the Shaikh indicates that they are aware of them. 4. The problem of bringing the airfield up to the standard required should not be insuperable if the co operation of the Kuwait Oil Company Is enlisted; and, after maintaining for many years an exclusive right to establish an airfield when no one else wished to do so, it would seem inadvisable to abandon this right at the present time. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, ^y^olitical Agent, MB Major Kuwait1* Application has been received from the A^onican Embassy that arrangements be made for blanket landing peimission at Kuwait, for a period of six months for aircraft owned and operated by the Arabian-American oil Ccntpany, a united states corporation. 2, The aircraft used will be Douglas O-^T’s bearmg the following United states registration numbers; NC 88789 NC 75409 NC 47762 NC 47765 NC 47755 The crews will be American, carrying licences issued by the United states government• The planes are equipped with two-way radio. 3.

Dear Low, Please refer to your letter C.32012/S6 of the l?th September about the renewal of. the Civil Air Agreement at Kuwait and. To the Minutes of the Meeting of the 22nd September at Ariel House to discuss this subject. 2. The establishment of a large scale military air base at Kuwait would presumably in any case have to be the subject of separate negotiations with the Shaikh since the Annexuro to the present Air Agreement merely gives the R.A.F. full rights to use civil aerodromes within the territory without additional payment. Should the establishment of such a base become necessary it would clearly be difficult, if not impossible, to secure the existing airfield for this purpose /-v if the Civil Air Agreement were to have lapsed and the Shaikh were to have granted rights for its operation to the Iraqis or Americans. I do not know however whether you would regard the present airfield (which is close to the town of Kov/eit) as necessarily the best site for an R.A.P. base. 3 3. We cannot, of course, be certain that the Shaikh will agree to a renewal of the existing agreement especially in view of the Political Resident*s report of the 23rd July, a copy of which was sent to you under our Ext. 1625/47, You will appreciate that any reluctance on his part may well be due to a desire to see the management of his airfield placed /in M,Y/.Low, Esq., Air Ministry, s King Charles Street, Whitehall, S.W.l.2 . in the hands of more active agents.

There is no strategic requirement for an air base in Koweit so long as we retain the use of Shaibah. If, however, as a result of the Iraq Treaty revision we are compelled to relinquish Shaibah, then we may wish to build an alternative base in Koweit. Our only requirement in Koweit is, therefore, to ensure that we shall be able, if we wish, to construct a ^ military air base there in the event of our losing Shaibah. However, in view of the inevitable delays which we must expect in reaching agreement with the Iraqis on a revised treaty, we consider that it would be unwise to await the outcome of the negotiations before deciding on the question of renewing the Civil Air Agreement with Koweit. Before expressing the view as to the necessity or otherwise from a strategical point of view of continuing the present agreement with the Sheikh of Koweit after it has lapsed next May, we should be grateful for your views as to whether the continuation of the present agreement is necessary to enable us to retain the option to construct a military air base in Koweit. Dunnett has pointed out that if we do not / continue A.K.Harrison, Esq., Commonwealth Relations Office, King Charles Street, London, 3.W.I.2. • continue the Agreement, Iraqi Airways may secure the right to operate the airfield, and we should like to know whether this would pre&lt;vent us subsequently negotiating an agreement for a military base* I imagine that if we did want a military air base we might in any case have to negotiate a new agreement and be unable to rely on the present Civil Air Agreement. I am sending a oopy of this letter to Dunnatt* Yours &amp;c., (3d) M.W.L0V/.f ^ Reference:- S.W*47 Dear Michael, 5th September, 1947. fl We have been considering, here \he question of whether or not we should press for renewal ~&lt;5r the Civil Air Agreement with Koweit which is due to lapse on 22nd May, 194&amp;. Sir Rupert Hay, political Resident in the Persian Gulf, is, we understand, paying a visit to London in the middle of this month, and the Ooranonwealth Relations Office have asked us for an expression of our views before then. 2. The present position as you probably know is that under the Agreement we are granted rights in Koweit in return for the payment of £500 per annum to the Sheikh* Although we have no fim agreement with them, the Koweit Oil Company now appear to be maintaining the aerodrome in return for the right to use it for their own aircraft. Iraqi Airways have recently applied for permission to operate through Koweit, ■ 3. Prom the purely civil aviation point of view the aerodrome at Koweit might be of some use as a staging post for the smaller charter and private aircraft engaged in local services, but we have no direct Civil trunk route interest in it. We therefore feel that the justification, if any, for continuing the Agreement and maintaining U.K* influence at Koweit must rest on grounds of broad political policy and on strategic considerations. It is perhaps worth noting in this connection that Iraqi Airways wish to operate through Koweit and therefore presumably if we allow our Agreement to lapse they may secure the right to opcxate the airfield. A.L.M#Cary, Esq., Air Ministry (S.6.), Whitehall, S.W.1. A*Vx 2* JW . I see from I/jw* s letter to Harrison of 19th July (0.3201^3.6) that you then felt that any proposal to allow the Agreement to Iqpse should be discouraged until such time as you know the results of the negotiations for the revision of the Iraq Treaty. We should like to .okm whether this is still your view and whether, in tne event of the Agreement being continued after May, 191B, you would feel disposed to meet the cost from your Vote. The Agreement would, under such an arrangement, remain a civil one, but as in the case of Muscat would merely provide a civil facade, preserving H.A.F. strategic interests.^ We should, of course, wish to make it clear on our side that/renewal of the Agreement carried with it no obligation or intention to effect aqr improvements to the aerodrome. 5. If the Agreement is to be renewed, a fur ther poiJ *fc which we will have to consider is whether an aerodrome superintendent is to be posted to Koweit and ii o wtio bears the cost of his salary* The present arrangoman under which the Koweit Oil Company run the airport and keep it in repair appears to have come about quite fortuitously and to rest on no formal agreement. A sxmila- problem has arisen, as you will remember, in the case of the iiuscat airfields (liasirah and Salalah). 6. As soon as you have had an opportunity of oonsidorins this suggestion, we could perhaps discuss the subject furt e with the Cocaaonwealth Relations Office. 7 # I am sending a copy of this letter to Ham son, C.R.O. * Yours &amp;c., (Sd) UJ.JXJNNKTT.

Strand, London, W*C.2. 6th October, 1947 . Lear Harrison, To meet the situation created by the gradual withdrawdl of R.A.l’. staff from various aerodromes over seas this Ministry has been discussing with the Air Ministry a plan.for joint operation of a number of main staging posts along the Entire Trunk routes. In effect this has meant that the civil authorities concerned have undertaken to provide civil control and aeradio staff to take over from the R.A.E. the facilities which they were operating during the war and have continued to oper ate for R.A.E, and civil purposes up to the present. Whereas in some colonies the local government has been able to assume responsibility for the provision of the civil staff, there are certain stations, including those in the Persian Gulf area, where M.C.A. has had to take direct responsibility for the provision of the necessary civil staffThis has been done, in most cases, through the agency of either B.C.A.C. or Internation al Aorad io Ltd. (a Company formed by the three British Airways Corporations to take over, where appropriate, the operation of civil aviation ground services.) The expend iture involved will be a direct charge on M.C.A. Votes and we had therefore to obtain the Treasury's approval to our proposals. Whilst they were prepared to agree that there was no alternative method of providing the necessary technical staff, they have suggested that in the case of the Persian Gulf Stations, we should discuss with you the possibility of recovering some part of the cost from the local Shaikhs, This suggestion is based on the assumption, derived from the Chicago Convention, that each Government should provide the ground facilities required in its territory for international air navigation. This assumption has been accepted in the case of the Colonies and we are now discussing with the Colonial Governments the division of the cost of providing trunk route facilities in their territories between local and U.K. funds. We are not in a position to say how much benefit the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Sharjah obtain from the operation of British trunk route services through their territories nor how much it would be reasonable to ask them to contri bute towards the cost. We must, therefore, see.k- your advice on whether we can expect any contribution from them, before replying to the Hreasury. We do appreciate, how ever, that as we have to pay for the privilege of operating aerodromes in these territories our chances of obtaining any contribut ions from the Shaikhs must be very small even if it can be established that they derive considerable benefit from the operation of the services.

V/TTH THE COMPLIMENTS OP THE UNDER SECRl^TARY OP STATE FOR commonwealth relations. Ext.2168/47. 13th October, 1947. Dear Mi 11s, Would you please refer to your letter No .R. 42104/47/ PG2 of the 6th October to Harrison about the cost of pro viding civil control and radio staff at aerodrowes in the Persian Gulf? As you are aware the position at Bahrain is that in exchange for exclusive civil aviation rights we make the Shaikh a small lump sum payment. Article 9 of the Bahrain Civil Aviation Agreement allows H.M.G. or their agents to retain all landing fees 'in recognition of H.M.G.’s expenditure on the aerodrome and of the consider ation paid to the Shaikh under clause 16'. In our view the Shaikh has already made a reasonable contribution towards the cost of running the aerodromes in his terri tories, by agreeing to forego landing fees# I am unable to see how we could ask him to go further than this, and even to reverse tne understanding on which the Agreement is based (which is that we pay for our privileged position) without negotiating a fresh agreement. This we certainly do not wish to do, especially as the existing Agreement has over a year to run. In the case of Shdrjah, in return for facilities for the operation of services by B.O.A.C., we pay the Shaikh a small personal subsidy together with rent for the air station and rest house, and a landing fee o f Rs 5 for every aircraft landing on the aerodrome. In our view it would be wrong to approach the Shaikh for any change in the working of the present agreement before its expiry merely on the grounds that our own arrangements had undergone a change. The Sharjah agreement is due for renewal in July next year and if any change (such as the retention of landing fees by H.M.G. in recognition of the cost of maintaining and staffing the aerodrome) is con templated we feel that this should await the negotiations ol a fresh agreement. Pending the comments of the Political Resident, Persian Gulf (to whom I am sending a copy of this corres pondence) I reserve my view whether, when the time comes, there will be any scope for recovering any part of the cost from the local Rulers, but, as you yourselves realise, the prospect of doing so is not very hopeful. Yours sincerely, Sd. E.P.DONALDSON. L.S .Mills, Esq., Ministry of Civil Aviation, Ariel House, Strand, w.C.2.COM IDENTJUL PERSIAN GULF RESILEI'ICY D.O.No«1823-S Bahrain, the 21st October, 1947 Dear Donaldson Please refer to the papers forwarded with Conmonwealth Relations Office endorsement No.Ext•2168/47 the 13th October, 1947, about the cost of providing cIvj-x control and radio staf^ at aerodromes in the Persian Gulf . 2* The position in the Gulf is that with considerable diificuity we have succeeded in bribing some of the Rulers ^ allow us to develop and maintain land ing-grounds or flying-boat bases in order to establish control over sir communications in this part of the world. There is a possibility that when we renew existing agreements we may have to pay more than we did before and it is out of the question to ask the States to contribute. incidentally the States concerned derive little or no benefit from the air services which use their landing grounds or flying- boat bases. So far as I am aware there is no service which picks up and sets down passengers at Sharjah while at Bahrain there are two services between the United Kingdom and Bahrain which are reserved for oil personnel and a number of through services to the Far East and Australia which do not cater at all for local traffic. There is at present one shuttle flying-boat service per week between Bahrain and Karachi which is available to the local public but that is being takai off from the 1st November. a ^3. The landing ground at Kuwait is not/designated one for international use. It is maintained by the Oil Company and used chiefly for their purposes. They are providing such facilities as exist and possibly some definite undertaking might be obtained from them that they will provide civil control and radio staff if the air agreement with the Shaikh is renewed, but I do not think we can call upon the Shaikh to meet the cost of this unless he himself presses for the development of the landing ground ss a designated ore and services are arranged which can be utilised by the State and its subjects.

In recant times, the R&gt;yal Air ibrce and the Koweit Oil Company have been virtually the only users of this air field, but permission to use it has recently been granted to Iraqi Airways and to a Company Icnown as Syrian Airways, and it seems not unlikely that in the near future aircraft of other companies may wish to laud at Kb wort, A Briefly, the present position is that under an agreement sirred in 1938 and due for renewal on the 22nd I.5ay, 1948• have tho exclusive right, in return for a payment to the Sheikh, to establish and maintain aerodromes and ancillary services at iSowoit, In addition, have the sole discretion under this agreement to appoint agents whose duties would be, inter aliai- 1, lb manage and maintain the aerodrome or aerodromes, 2, lb exercise the supervision necessary to the carrying out of the Kb welt Air Navigation Rile, (with the exception of air sanitary formalities and passport and customs regulations,) ^5, Tfo collect landing foes, 4* 1b supply fuel and lubricants, 5# 1b operate any wireless station which may be established for communication with aircraft and to collect any charges made for such services.

It had however some slight value as a possible insurance in the event of expectations at other aerodromes in the area not being realised. This value was to some extent dependent on the present characteristics of the airfield and possibilities of development. &lt; 4» Mr. Low (Air Ministry S.6 ) stated that the Air Ministry interest at Kuwait was also slight. The position of the P.A.F. in the area was uncertain pending the final outcomer) H 5 5} of discussions for tiie renewal of the treaty with Iraq* Kuwait had, for the Air MLnistiy,- a certain value as an insurance in the event of other arrangements failing although the cost of development of the airfield to the standard of a H*A*F. base would amount to several million pounds* It was noted that if the present agreement were allowed to lapse and control of the airfield passed to sane other agency, it might be difficult if not impossible for the HAF to negotiate a Defence Agreement for use of the present site* 5* Mr. Hallows (C.H.O#) stated that the retention of civil aviation rights at Kuwait had a political and prestige value* Hie cessation of such rights might leave a dangerous vacuum. Already enquiries had been made by Sudan Airways and Indian Airways in the possibility of operating services to Kuwait. After some discussion 6. £t, was, a&amp;read Conclusion (iii) that while civil aviation interests alone were not such as to warrant a renewal of the agreement, there appeared to be a sufficient case for its renewal for reasons of prestige, political desirability, civil aviation and ibyal Air Force insurance, combined, provided, (a) that the Kuwait Oil Company would continue to act as airport managers, and (b) that there was no additional commitment to E*M«G. beyond a sum of the ' order of the £500 annual rental* now being paid. Ihe incidence of cost as between the Departments concerned would require separate consideration. 7* 'Ihe meeting discussed the present arrangement whereby the Kuwait Oil Company managed the airfield under a completely informal arrangement.

I enclose for your information a copy of letter No.1823-3 dated the 21st October from Sir Rupert Hay, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, from which you will see that he considers it possible that we may have to pay more for the renewal of existing air agreements with the Gulf Rulers and that to asE them to contribute to the cost of aerodrome facilities is out of the question. 3. Hay points out that, as things are at present, the States concerned derive little, or no, benefit - at least so far as passenger facilities are concerned - from the air services which land in their territories. It is true that Bahrain, an d to some extent the Trucial Coast, enjoy the benefit of a regular air-mail and air freight service, but it is open to doubt whether the Rulers concerned would consider this a sufficient reason for accepting reduced payments, especially in view of the introductionof a fast mail steamer service and the greatly improved steamer services generally reported in Bahrain telegram No. 1011 (a copy of which was sent to Major Jones on the 13th October, Ext. 2132/47). 4 5 4. It is perhaps worth mentioning here that, should it be proposed to open negotiations for the renewal of the agreements in the Persian Gulf on the basis of the States concerned contributing towards the cost of aero drome facilities, we should expect the Shaikhs to ask for some assurance that better passenger facilities for their nationals should be provided by British airlines than at present. \ 5.

As soon as the aerodrome at Basra is serviceable and capable of aocoraaodating large aircraft, it ■ay be that we will move the Viking from Kuwait to that aerodrome, but a decision on this matter has not yet been made* Although this aircraft is now ' ased at Kuwait and not at Baghdad as was originally intended, we would be grateful if the British Embassy could be informed of its presence, since it is quite likely to require assistance, particularlyV ■ if it is necessary to obtain v:lsas or clejiranoe for the aircraft at short notice. As you are doubtless aware, there are complications involved in obtaining Iranian, Kuwait and l ahrain visas and the aircraft tiay be required to visit any of these places, amongst others, at abort notice. With effect from the 25 th Octolxar, 1947, we shall have another Viking baaed at Karachi, - emission for this basing has been given by the Director General of Civil Aviation to the Pakistan Government for a period of three months, subject to one week l s notice. This aircraft, like that at Kuwait, will be self-contained with its own maintenance staff, but will return to this country for 200 hour and major inspections. Although it is not anticipated that any assistance will be required in respect of this aircraft, we think you should be informed of its presence since it is being based at Karachi virtually at the invitation of the Pakistan Government.

London letter No Ext. 2519/47, dated the 21st November 1947 to the Political Resident Persian Lull. From time to time v«e receive, from the Ministry of Civil Aviation, requests originated by foreign aviation companies for permission for aircraft on charter flights to land at aerodror es in the Arab States of the Gulf, he usually pass such notifications on to you oi the Political Agent Bahrain by telegram. &gt; 2. We understand that the procedure/is that the foreign comjiany concerned requests permission from tie Ministry of Civil Aviation to make their flight, with landings at certain specified aerodromes. In the case of the Arab States of the Persian Gulf the Ministry o Civil Aviation say that they inform you direct by telegram if the' aircraft is British or Dominion, but ask us to notify you if the aeroplane belongs to a foreign company. They al c o 'state that you are the sole channel of communication between the Ministry ‘of Civil Aviation and the aerodromes concerned. However, they agree tl at it is normal a foreign company making a flight firstly, to ascertain that the aerodrome or aerodromes concerned are capable of receiving the type of machine they are using and, secondly, for the pilot of the aeroplane to request permission to‘land at the next aerodrome before leaving the one from which he started. 3. In the case of commercial charter flights, it is not necessary, I think, for the permission of any ol the Gull Rulers to be obtained for landings at aerodromes in their territories. You may, however, none the less consider o.t desirable that we, or the Ministry of Civil Aviation, should continue, as at present to notity you by telegram in all cases. Would you kindly let us know v/hether you consider the present procedure satisfactory, or whether there is any variation which you would wish to suggest.. .{T CONFIDENTIAL Copied I.C.tf Kuwait kc CONFIDENTIAL S .

(a) Joint user airfields overseas are those on which facilities are provided as of right on, an agreed joint oasis for both military and civil aircraft. Airfields at present in this category are shown in Appendix 'A 1 . The administration and organisation of such airfields will thus be the responsibility of the Air Officer Commanding concerned and of the local Government in whose territory the airfield is situated. It is not yet possible to define in detail the limits of the respective respon sibilities of the R.A.F, and Civil Authorities concerned. It will be necessary at each airfield for Air Officers Commanding to consult with local Governments in order to carry out the general principles which have, been.agreed. (b) At joint user airfields the R.A.F. Commanding Officer will bear complete responsibility for the discipline and administration of service personnel and, within the limits normally applicable on an R.A.F. station, of any Air Ministry civil staff and employees. The administration and discipline of civilian staff employed by or on-behalf of the local Government concerned will be the responsibility of the local Government. An officer of the local Government concerned will bo placed in .charge of such civilian staff on an airfield. (c) Notwithstanding the fact that either the Service or civilian interests on a particular airfield will always predominate, the R.A.F. Commanding Officer and the senior civil officer will each deal with their own subordinates only, so far as disciplinary enquiries and disciplinary action are concerned, except that in any cases where both Service and civilian interests may be affected a general enquiry may be held by mutual agreement. The R.A.F. Commanding Officer and the senior civil officer will each issue any day to day administrative instructions which may be required to their own subordinates. At no joint user airfield will there be any question of the direct subordination of the senior civil officer to the R.A.F. Station Commander or vice versa, but for operational convenience subordinate staff on duty may be placed in the charge of a senior officer, cither civil or R.A.F. (d) His Majesty's Government arc bliged by international agree ments to provide facilities for the lawful passage of civil aircraft, both British and foreign, on the international trunk routes. Certain local air services operated by local airlines will also use joint user airfields. It is not possible for H.M.G. to deny the use of airfields open to inter national air traffic to international and local airlines (except in time of national emergency, when the facilities may be denied, to all operators cither completely or partially on• a-non-discrimino.tory basis; action in emergency would only be taken on instructions from, or with the specific approval of, departments in London.) It will not therefore be open to an R.A.F. Commander at a joint user airfield to issue.orders precluding the use of the airfield by civil operators, British or foreign. It will be the responsibility of the local government to check the entitlement of civil operators. In the same way it will not be open to a local government to prevent the passage of Service aircraft in order to safeguard particular civil requirements. Clearance for the passage of foreign military aircraft will be co-ordinated by the Air Ministry. (o) In peace-time the R.A.F. have certain strategic obligations which can only be met by keeping open a certain defined route capacity v/hich may not be required in full except under threat of emergency, but which must be kept at all times available. It may, therefore, be necessary at joint user airfields to formulate quotas for Service md civil use. The Service quota would take full account of strategic needs, and the civil quota would / bebe ■'vrilcblc for distribution among those civilian operrt.mc ■m. ^ 00n vtntcfi rights to operate to the airfield concerned. The quotas to be aenlicd TeTc *stiion would be a matter for separate oxscussx^n xn each case and would, of c urso, be subject to revision b..th on ..coount oi ^ny alteration by agreement in the balance of e vil and strategic needs .nd any physical alteration to the airfield which affected its total capacity. 2. Adninistrativc and Fi nancial Principle* Ownership (a) At all joint user airfields in Colonial or British xnflucn^c territory there ‘should he separate civil and R -r!/ x^speotivciy contained as possible, where the civil and bervxce c.miat.xnts reopec.xvcxy should be handled. air fi e lds it is expected that the civil site w uld either be owned'by the local government concerned or held on long lease, e.g. fifty years. 3 f Branding Fec_s .

The choice of author! y as between and civil will in each case be settled locally. n general the larger user will predominate, but due weight must also be given to strategic factors. (d) As far a.s possible common user ra.dio and control facilities will employ I.C.A.O. standards and frequencies. (e) At each joint user airfield a joint aeronautical communications traffic office will be required to deal with aeronautical traffic ss classified by I.G.A.0. (f) It is desirable that I.C.A.O. procedures contained in Document Con. 126 , os modified by the Ministry of Civil Aviation for use within the U.K. , should be taught to all R.A.F. and civil operators employed on the integrated aeronautical fixed and mobile telecommunications services at joint user stations. As a long term policy adequate training in I.C.A.O. procedures will be included‘in the syllabuses of R*A. t, bignals iraining Schools for Telegraphists and Signallers. (g) It is hoped eventually that the aeronautical fixed telecommunica tions service will function as a separate organisation from other service and civil administrative and operational circuits at joint user stations. (h) The Air Mini try and Ministry of Civil Aviation will be respon- s ible in consultation v/ith the Colonial Of 1 ice ana i^he civil administrations concerned for arranging for the provision of any additional Signals personnel required to meet any large and sustained increase in air movements that may arise. (j) During the initial period of build-up and development it will do necessary to review the joint plan as a whole at intervals of approximately six months to take account , inter alia, of any major alterati N nt in planned route capacity. The above constitute the main signals principles in the light of wnich a more detailed examination of signals requirements and.procedures on the trunk routes is proceeding. A separate end more comprehensive signals plan will bo issued at a later stage. 7. Air Traffic Control . A detailed plan for Air Traffic Control at all joint user stations is being worked out, and will be issued shortly. 8. Equipment The division of responsibility for the provision, installation, replacement and maintenance of technical equipment at joint user airfields is still under discussion. Separate proposals will be put forward as soon as possible. 9. Finance. No charge in- existing principles or current instructions is intro duced. fry special instructions about financial adjustment between the civil and military authorities as a result of joint user arrangements will be issued by departments in London as circumstances require.✓ APPENDIX 'A 1 2 3 Joint User Airfields • Category 'A' Trunk Route Stations Luqa Castel Benito El Adem Benina Khartoum Eastleigh Changi Category ’B 1 Not on Trunk Routes Nicosia Khomaksar Kai Tak Cate gory ' C * Stati on s at which certain defined facilities only will be retained in joint use ♦ Sharjah Bahrein 2, In the case of Negombo, negotiations will be carried out between the Air Ministry and the Ceylon Government, and the station cannot therefore be categorised as a joint user^ airfield under the general Air Ministry/Ministry of Civil Aviation/Colonial Office plan* It is hoped, however, that any agreement reached with the Ceylon Government for joint use at Negombo would be on the lines now proposed for other stations. 3.

CONFIDENTIAL Colonial Office p Dov/ni ng Street, nugust, 1947 * Sir, I have the honour to inform you that I have had under consideration, in consultation with the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Civil Aviation, the question of the joint use of airfields in Colonial territory by civil and Royal Air Force aircraft. 2* The varying and sometimes conflicting nature of the requirements of civil and service aircraft has in the past led to the construction of separate airfields to cater for civil and service use. There are, however, certain Colonies which by their small extent are unable to set aside sufficient land to allow of the construction of two airfields sufficiently far apart to cater for both service and civil use. Furthermore, the cost of the construction of airports suitable for international air traffic has risen enormously, and His Majesty's Government are most anxious to avoid any expenditure on what could be considered a wasteful duplication of facilities required for both civil and service aircraft. Investigation has also shown that airfields constructed solely either for service or civil use are not likely to be used to their full capacity within the foreseeable future, and that it should be possible by a careful adjustment of the respective claims of both service and civil aircraft to use one airport to its maximum capacity without seriously hindering the full development of either service or civil aviation. 3* Both during and after the v. ; ar the Royal Air Force continued to provide facilities required by civil aviation at airports in Colonial territory used by both Royal Air Force Transport Command services and Imperial trunk services operated by the three United Kingdom Corporations. You will appreciate that the Royal ^ir Force can not continue to provide these facilities because of the severe reduction in their manpower following upon the rapid demobilisation of the Service. Furthermore, the maintenance by the Royal Air Force of such facilities not only gave rise to political difficulties in that members of the Royal Air Force could and did legitimately complain that their services were being utilised for purely civil purposes, but also represented a diversion of manpower in the Service to ends which were not consonant with the full and proper development of the Royal Air Force in time of peace. As you are aware from the deliberations of the Colonial Civil Aviation Conference (Miscellaneous No. 514)&gt; His Majesty's Government consider_that the primary responsibility for maintaining and operating airfields in the Colonial territories must rest with the Colonial /administrationadministration concerned. Similarly, insofar as any airfield owned by the Royal i-.ir Force is to be used by civil aviation, His Majesty’s Government consider that the facilities required by civil aviation should, as far as possible, also be provided by the civil authority. 4. I enclose a copy of an instruction which the Air Ministry, in consultation with the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Colonial Office, are sending to Air Officers Commanding in Chief, Overseas Commands, as the first draft of the basic principles which it is considered should govern the joint use of airfields in Colonial territory by service and civil aviation* It is hoped that these principles will form the foundation on which it will be- possible to work out the details of integration of both Royal Air Force and civil staffs and facilities at airfields open for joint use. Many problems connected with such joint use have still to be more fully worked out, and I hope to address you further on these problems in the near future. Nevertheless, I consider that in view of the imminent further reductions in the Royal Air Force manpower, you will wish to have this preliminary indication of the lines on which subsequent planning should proceed in order that you may be in a position to proceed at once with such local arrangements as you may find it possible to make with the local Royal Air Force authorities. 5 . I shall be glad to receive your observations upon the Air Ministry instruction as soon as possible. 6 . Copies of this despatch are being sent by the Air Ministry to Overseas Commands.

'.Col.Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.S#, C.S.I#, The Residency, Bahrein.CONFIDENTIAL Ext.2743/47 Notes of a meeting held in the Commonwealth Relations Office on 2nd December, 1947, to disucss future aerodrome arrangements at Kuwait ^ The Chairman said that it was now desirable that the present arrangements at Kuwait should be placed on a more satisfactory footing. The existing Civil Air Agreement with the Shaikh of Kuwait dl was due for renewal in May, 1948 and the question now arose whether His Majesty’s Government should enter into negotiat ions for its extension. , 2. Mr, Southwell stated that the Kuwait Oil Company relied extensively on air transport for the movement of both personnel and equipment to Kuwait. At present their traffic was carried partly by aircraft operating under charter to the Company, partly by their own aircraft, and partly (between Basra and Kuwait) by Iraqi Airways The Shaikh had intimated that the air strip immediately to the South of the town which the Company were using and .maintaining (which had originally been prepared by His Majesty's Government) would have to be abandoned as it was situated close to one of the main gates of the town, and across one of the main routes leading to the town. The Company were accordingly proposing to construct an air strip for their own purposes either a few miles to the west of the town or near the new harbour at Rahaihil about 20 miles to the south. It was thought that the former site would probably be better owing to there being less likelihood of sandstorms. The length of the strip would be 6,000 feet in order to permit the land ing of four-engined aircraft. Natural foundations would apparently be strong enough to bear the weight of aircraft of this size. Mr. Southwell added that he would like to see Kuwait put on the civil air map as a port of call on a main route from this country. The operations of the Oil Company had expanded rapidly and would soon reach a considerable magnitude and he thought that the amount c of traffic offering would be substantial. He mentioned that there would shortly be as many as 1,100 American and British employees of the Company at Kuwait. 3. Mr. Ratcliffe-Cousins stated that the Ministry of Civil Aviat ion did not consider that, in view of the facilities already avail able at Margil, Dhahran and Bahrain, there was at present justificat ion for His Majesty's Government financing the construction of a large international airport at Kuwait. Kuwait was linked with the B.O.A.C. traffic lines by the Iraqi Airways Kuwait/Basra service. Reference was made to the possibility of developing a flying-boat base at Kuwait and to the possibility of B.O.A.C.'arranging a call there by the United Kingdom/Bahrain bi-weekly flying-boat service. This was understood to be at present under investigation by B.O.A.C. but it v/as pointed out that radio navigational aids would be requir ed for any regular service.

Rat c liffe- C ousins added that the B.O.A.C. over-all planr2 for trunk services for the next few years did not include Kuwait*?- The Ministry of Civil Aviation would naturally welcome 'the provision of an emergency landing strip in Kuwait territory, but would not be prepared to pay for its construction and upkeep. 5. Mr. Low explained that the interest of the Air Ministry was solely to secure an option on the use of the airfield for military purposes - i.e. that whatever airfields were constructed in Kuwait, the R.A.F. should have the right to use and develop them if events made this necessary. 6 . The question of renewal of the Ci vi l Air Agreement was next considered. It was thought that the Shaikh might raise his price but would be principally interested in securing an assurance that, if renewed, proper aerodrome facilities would be provided. Unless we could promise tMs, the Shaikh might not be willing to renew the Agreement. His Majesty’s Government would then lose their exclusive rights as regards management of aerodromes in Kuwait territory, and, unless separate arrangements could be made, the R.A.F. would lose their military rights attached to the Agreement by exchange of letterE If we did not renew the Agreement we could scarcely object to the Shaikh according similar rights for management of aerodromes to another coufntry. It was suggested that a possible solution might be for the Air Agreement to be renewed and for the Kuwait Oil Company to act. as His Majesty's Government's agents for the running of the aerodrome which would infact be designed primarily, if not solely, represent- to to meet the Oil Company's requirements. The Oil Company atives pointed out that this function was not strictly germane their business and that the Company would not, be able or willing to provide facilities over and above those required for their own purposes. Before committing themselves to accepting the position of his Majesty's Government's agents they would wish to give the matter further consideration. It was agree d that the first step should be to instruct the Political Resident to approach the Shaikh informally and ascertain his reaction to a proposal for the renewal of,the Agreement, more or less in its present form. Mr. Southwell stated that he would like to know what rights the Kuwait Oil Company enjoyed, under the terms of their Concession Agreement, read with the Civil Air Agreement, as regards the const ruction and operation of aerodromes. The Commonwealth Relations Office representatives undertook to examine the position. COMMONWEALTH RELATIONS OFFICE, Downing Street, 5th December, 1947 oCo» Ext. 2743/47 In May, 1934* under the ’’Civil Air Agreement” the Shaikh granted I to H.M.G. ’’exclusive rights to establish ard maintain as his agents and subject etc an aerodrome or aerodromes and ancillary services ”, and any right or facility which he may subsequent ly have granted to the Kuwait Oil Company or to anyone else- must be read as being, subject 'to the grant of the above exclusive rights. If, therefore, the above wording can properly be construed as a grant of the exclusive right to establish aerodromes, there would seem to be no room for argument, and the K.O.C. could not claim to do anything in contravention of tne rights of H.M.G. I am inclined to think, however, that the words ”as his agents” must be read as qualifying the whole expression ”to establish and maintain”, and that what in fact was granted, whether that was the intention or not, was the sole right to act as the Shaikh's agei ts in the estab lishment anti maintenance of aerodromes, - leaving it open to him to allow other persons to establish aerodromes on their own account The question is, has he in fact done so? The relevant passages the concession seem to me to be contained in articles 5(A) and 9, whereunder the Shaikh allowed the K.O.C. certain facilities 'for th purposes of its operations hereunder”, i.e., the operations speci fied in article 1. These were the rights ( inter alia ): ( £ ) t o construct and to operate various specified works ’’and any other facilities or works (i.e. of a similar nature) which - \the Co. may consider necessary: (b) to utilise all such means of transportation by land, air or water communication or operation as may be necessary in the effective conduct of its operations: (c) to select in consultation with the Shaikh areas of land... with exclusive surface rights upon which to erect..terminal and shipping facilities and any other works required for the Co’s operations. The above rights seem to me t rims f aci e to be wide enough to justify the construction of an aerodrome - subject, no doubt, in regard to the selection of a site, to the provisions of articles 5 and S of the Political agreement of 5. 3. 34, but subject also, it must be noted, to article C of that agreement, which runs as .follows: - 'The right given to the Coy. by its agreement with the Shaikh to utilise means of transportation by air shall be subject to ' any general regulations for civil aircraft by the Shaikh on the advice of H.M.G.” If, as I assume, the regulations referred to are those printed as Part I to tne 'Civil Air Agreement” of 23. 5. 34, there would seem to be some difficulty - which cannot be got over by mere reliance on the words 'without hindrance”. Under these regulations, aircraft are not to use as a place of landing or departure any place other than 'the aerodrome at Kuwait,” and must, further, observe the published conditions governing its use - a provision repeated in the form of special authorisation issued by the Shaikh to fly over his territory. 1 gather from Sir R. Hay’s letter No.C/149 of the 16th November, that, save in.the cases of the airway companies there mentioned, the above regulations are to some extent a dead letter, owing to the difficulty of enforcement. But the establishment of a new aerodrome at which to land would be a different matter. (Ith.) K.M. K(emp) 11.12.1947 ’LB’ /co:iFii)K;ri , U L.

(ii) The absence of any facilities for passengers and others should be remedied* For instance there is no shelter for them from the sun and wind and no latrine or means for disposal of rubbish such as used cartons, empty tins, and scraps of food from the aircraft. 2.

V Dear Donaldsan. Would you please refer to your letter No.Ext.2743/47 of 29 th December on the rights of His Majesty’s Goveraaent and tne Aoweit Oil OOB^jary in the matter of the establishaent and maintenance of airfields in Koweit. Our views, after consultation with our legal adviser, are as follows. 2. fce oteerve that in the original copy of the Koweit Civil Air agreement the English and Arabic versions are printed side by side and the signature of the Sheikh end the Political /»gent are in the centre of the page beneath tiie two versions. Both versions would therefore appear to be equally authentic and we can refer to the Arabic version to assist us in interpreting the English. In the Arabic version of Article 1 there is a dash after 'maintain* and another after * issued by him*. This to our minds, makes it qu^te clear that the Agreement granted to His Majesty's Government exclusive rights to establish and maintain an aerodrome or aerodromes and that the words 'as his agents* simply define the capacity in which His Majesty’s Government shall exercise these exclusive rights. 3 . It is true that Articles 3(e) and 9 of the Coraixercial Agreement of December, 1934- between the Eheikh and Kowsit Oil Company might be interpreted as granting to the Kowsit &lt;Jil Company the right to construct and operate aerodromes, but in our opinion this Agreement must be read subject to the Civil Air Agreement in this respect. It be presumed that this was tiie intention of the Iheikh, and that it was also the intention of the Koweit Oil Compar\y is demonstrated by reference to Article 6 of the Political Agreement of March, 1934- between His Majesty’s Government and the Koweit Oil Company. Article 6 states t.iat: E.P. Donaldson, Esq., Couaenwealth Relations Office. /'theCosy to tl^e Nautical Resident in t he Persian OuJi' C'CBunonwealtk Rel uLth Relations Office, Downing Street, . London, 3. tf. 1 , hb Sxt.30fV'43 5th .IarwiMrs~»i 15W 1/ My dear Soutixwell, fould you please refer to qy letter No.ihct. 2743/4? of the 30 th December last, in which 1 prouised to let yon have our views as to the rights of your Company in regard to the construction and operation of aerodraaoa in noweit. .»e are now in a position tj do this. 2. Article I of the Civil Air .s-greement between his Majesty’s Government in the halted kingdom and &amp;* ighness the Sheikh of k owe it, dated 23^d ay, 1^34 (tise Agreement is still in force) reads as follmvs:- *?he Sheikh agree-a to grant to his majesty’s Government exclusive rlglita t ^ establish and maintain as his agents and sabject to the provisions of tills agreement and of trie Air navigation liegulations for Civil Aircraft issued by him, an aerodrome or aerodraues and 4 ancillary services within the Sheikh's territory, and to charge fees in respect of ths use of the aerodrcsse or aerodromes and such aacillttry services. 1 * It is true that A reticles 5(a) and 9 of the Commercial Agi-eesaent of 23rd December, 1934 between the 3i t eiMi cad your Company might be inter preted as purporting to grant to the Kowett Oil Coapany tlie light to construct and or&gt;erate aerodr&amp;aes, but in our opinion ibis Agrees at must be re&amp;d subject to Hie previous uivil Air Agreement in this respect, fou will further observe in this connection th&amp;t irticle 6 of tne i-oliticai Agreement of $th taroh, 1934 between His Majesty’s Government and your Corapany ctates that *the right given tohia Gomphry by its Agreement with the Sheikh to utilise means uf transportation by air sirJuL be subject to ary general regulations for civil aircraft made by the dlieiich on the tidvice of ilia Majesty’s Government*. The regulations referred to must clearly be the Air Navigation Regulations for Civil Aircraft made ty trie ' 3heikii, which fora.i part of the Koweit Air gree-uent, and of which /regulation 4 C.A.P. dputnwell, ;usq., Kuweit Gil Go., Ltd., 1, Great Cumberland ihLace London, 1.Regulation 2*. reads ds follows:- •The aircraft shall not use as a place of landing or departure any place otlier than the aerodrome at Kov/eit*. 2^ Any rights of your Couipar^r in regard to the construction of an aerodraae contained in articles 5(&amp;) and 9 of the Commercial Agreaaent must of course also be read as subject to Articles 5 and (as regards the selection of site) to Article 8 of the Political agreement of 5th March, 1934. 5 . The general effect of all this seems to be that the Koweit Oil Comparer cannot claim any rUlvt to establish or maintain an aerodrome under the provisions of their Commercial Agreement at least so long as the grant of exclusive rights to His Majesty’s Government under Article I of the Civil Air agreement with the Sheikh remain operative. It will, therefore, be necessary for your Coaipahy to obtain the consent of His Majesty* s Government (and through theta, of the Sheikh of Koweit) before undertaking the construction of a new aerodrome in Koweit territory to serve the needs of your Comi^any. We should hope, however, that by joint consultation it will be possible to reach an agreement for the construction of a new aerodrome or landing ground to take the place of the present one, which will be agceptable to all parties. 6 . In the light of the above we shall be glad to know whether your Company now have any definite proposals to pur forward. Yours sincerely. (Sgd.) S.je.

The ruxnrsy, wtiioh will be paved, is orientated within close li&amp;dts into the prevailing wind and will be constructed to give the following strength requirements * wheel load 54*000 lb,, wheel ^peeiwg 30 ft,* tyre praasure 30 lb, per square inch. These strength requirements are 20 ', lees than the t, 0,4*0. ropiiresoents for a Glass 0 aerodrome ami are considered adequate for the t^pe of aircraft which this conpany will require to operate at Kuwait, Provision is made for the levelling and consolidation of landing strips on either side* at the ends of the runway, to allow the marinwre safety for* any aircraft aeoidentally leaving the runway during take-off or landing. As shown in the plan, the length of these landing strips is 7*900 ft.^ n, O b ? 71m tiraliiago of otona water tnm the rtearay «nd landing atrip* 1* also provided for. 3* Taxiway a are a'ranged to allow the laain v\mmr*$ to b* «ito.*od or l«ft at throe points.

Huildinga inelurte one to house the usual aerodrome •ervloea and administrative offices, an annate for the hangar, aerodrome maintenance buildings, a garage for vetiicle* and a store for i wf^ material*. km Oarafisl oonsideration ha* been given to the question of siting the airstrip and the position indicated cm the asp was selected after dose examination of a wide area. The reasons for the selection of this site are as follows*- (a) Xt is reasonably level and oorapar&amp;tively little grading is required. a main run^y of adequate length can be set out in the prevailing wind and, if it is considered desirable at a later stage, a subsidiary strip roughly at ^ight angles to the main runway is practicable. (b) Inspect ion indioatud that the bearing value of tiie sub-grade would be adequate. (e) As far as could be asoertained the arse 1* relatively free from sandstoms.- fj. i % * * W (d) The air approaches are free of obstruction (it Is not considered that the eoall hill ioaoim as ^rt Mushirif will be a danger to aircraft In any way) • (e) Ho Sag&gt;ertant roads or tracks cross the area* (f) Generally speaking, the site is free frout water oourses (there are indlcaticios that stans water floes aaross the area and p “©vision for drainage is therefore necessary). (g) The appi'oaoti areas art generally suitable for the installation of ^i&gt;roach lighting;. (h) The natural surface has a reasonably good bearing value and would probably be adequate for light aircraft, 5.

The matter has been discussed with the Treasury, and it has been decided that full United Kingdom rate for grass surface airfields is inappropriate. But as a token of the position of His Majesty’s Government as the authority empowered by the Sheikh to operate an aerodrome at Kuwait, and in recognition of past expenditure there, it has been decided that a nominal fee should be charged# This will be:- For aircraft not exceeding 20,000 weight 5/- a landing, For twin aircraft exceeding 20,000 weight 10/- a landing. For 4 engined aircraft - £l a landing# It is hoped that the Political Agent will be able to collect these fees without any more than nominal expenditure. Iraqi airways should be asked to pay fees on this scale, which will remain in force till an agreement is reached with the Oil Company for future operation of this airfield# There is some difficulty about credit of the fees already collected letters 258-42/15 of 19th February and 299-42/15 of 28th February from the Political Agent Kuwait to the Commonwealth Relations Office state that they have been credited to the Ministry of Civil Aviation.

Southwell told me, if I remember rightly that approval for its construction* was on the point of issuing from his office; but that it was for the people on the spot to decide when the work should actually start, bearing in mind the rest of their construction programme. I am accordingly asking Galloway to take up the matter with the local manager. 3. I enclose a copy of Andrew*s letter No.B/84(6/2) of the 7th October, which emphasises the desirability of our taking ewe* action at once if we wish to retain our control over Kuwait airfields, though he appears to be under some misapprehension about the possibility of our preventing other air lines from using them for through services in competition with the B.O.A.C. \ B.A.B. Burrows, Esquire, Foreign Office, LONDONSECRET. The Political Agency, ggt ie No.R/95(6/lO). Ky dear Jir Rupert, Please refer to your Secret letter No.(30/15/48) of the 23rd October, 1948 regarding the new aerodrome at Kuwait. 2. The Kuwait Oil Company have agreed amongst themselves to construct an air strip on the new site already selected. The basis of their plan will be their minimum requirements so far as dimensions of the run-way, its bearing strength and the technical services to be installed are concerned. 3. In order to begin negotiations for an Agency Agreement with the interested Departments of His Majesty’s Government, the Kuwait Oil Company are working out their own requirements which will represent the limit to which they are prepared to finance the construction. Plans will be ready shortly and provided that His Majesty’s Government require no major modifications it is assumed that construction will soon commence. It seems unlikely, however, that the case will be sufficiently far advanced to permit of starting work this year. Yours sincerely, Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I.

You may now, t your discreti n, negoti.^te with the Sheikh a new Agreement of ten ye rs* aurution. A rear it of the old agreement is enclosed, which, if you see no objection, you sh /id present to the Sheikh. 3. The redraft is substantially the same as the old Agreement, the changes being mainly for the urpose of bringing the old Agreement into line with modern requirements* The following are comments on joints of detail:- article 1 . article A . article Ik. The phrase r 'as his agents 1 ' has been omitted, inclusion led to ambiguity in the past. Its This provision was not in the old Agreement. I c isider it desirable, but if the Sheikh is reluctant to accept it, it may, your discretion, be omitted. This weald mean, of course, renumbering the subsequent Articles in the Agreement, and amending the cross-references in the present Articles 6, 8 and 9. The phrase 'except in the case of aircraft exempt from payment of such duties' has been added to the wording of the corresponding article in the old Agreement. It is now bee ming international practice for countries to exempt e ch others 1 airlines from customs duties on fuel taken on board aircraft engaged in scheduled air services, and a provision to this effect is likely to be included in four bil teral civil a viation agreements. Since we maintain that for the purposes of international civil aviation, Kuwait is to be regarded as United Kingdom territory, those countries with whom we have civil aviation agreements will expect their airlines to be granted exemption in Kuwait. I am not clear, however, what the current practice is in Kuwait, and if the Sheikh raises the questi a of which aircraft shall be exempt, you should say that this will be a matter for subsequent arrangement.

Sir, I should be glad if you would refer to your telegram No. 280 of 9th December in which you asked for instructions for a new Kuwait Civil Air Agreement. 2. You may now, at your discretion, negotiate with the Shaikh a new Agreement of ten years’ duration. A redraft of the old Agreemtent is enclosed, which, if you see no objection, you should present to the Shaikh. 3. The redraft is substantially the same as the old Agreement, the changes being mainly for the purpose of bringing the old Agreement into line with modern requirements. The following are comments on points of detail:- Article 1. The pharse ”as his agents' has been omitted. Its inclusion led to ambiguity in the past. Article 4. This provision was not in the old Agreement. I consider it desirable, but if the Shaikh is re reluctant to accept it, it may at your discretion, be omitted. Tnis would mean, of course, renumbering the subsequent Articles in the Agreement, and amending the cross-references in the present articles 6, 8 and 9. A rticle 14 . The phrase 'except in the case of aircraft exempt from payment of such duties' has been auded to the wording of the corresponuing Article in the old Agreement, It is new becoming international, practice for countries to exempt each others' airlines from customs duties on fuel taken on board aircraft engaged in scheduled air services, and a provision to this effect is likely to be included in our bilateral civil aviation agreements. Since we maintain that for the purpose of international civil aviation, Kuwait is to be ' regarded as United Kingdom territory, those ‘'countries with whom we have civil avaltion agreements will expect their airlines to be granted exemption in Kuwait. I am not clear, however, what the current practice is in Kuwait, and if the Shaikh raises the question oi which aircraft shall be exempt, you should say that this will be a matter for subsequent arrangement.

Paragraph 14(iii) of Part I of the old Agreement merely laid down that offenders against against the Regulations would 'be dealt with according to the law'.

We wish to assure you that we were and still are, sincere towards whatever iiMO propose. At the same time it is our desire to maintain a spirit of national supre macy in Keeping with mod rn developments so as to leave no room for local criticism. In accordance, therefore, we shall explain the following points which may not be in consistence with this preface. a) For example, it is our opinion that the text of article 1 should'be amended and read ss follows:- 'H.R. the Jheikh of Kuwait agrees to grant HMO all rights etc on behalf'of H.H. n If there is any ambiguity, as referred to in your letter, this can be settled in the spirit of mutual confidence between us. b) as the contents of pcras 2 and 3 of Article 1 are mere technical points we have no objection to them. c) As to Article 2, there is no objection to HMO- appointing employees on their behalf to manage the aero drome or aerodromes as is thought necessary, provided that they conform to local regulations and that th?ir work is technical, and not connected with the administration, If possible, v/e desire our health officials to assist the’ ^.A.O and participate in his work for the purpose 'of acquiring experience and^ptfrticlcation in future. ^ ith regard to passport and cu toms work, as you have stated, this will naturally be the responsibility of our officials. d) We, also, agree wholly to the contents of article 3 which is almost technical: but we desire that some of our people should be trained to perforin such work in the future. e) The contents of Article 4 are quite sound and there is no dust on it, but it would be preferable to insert the following: x,o train the nationals in work connected with telegraph and wireless communications if it becomes necessary. f) article 5 - have no, obj*Cwion to HtiG granting such rights on our beiialf, provided thr)t all applications for jhe^use of the aerodrome or aerodromes in the co mtry be submitted to us. No rights for the use of the eerodrome or aerodromes may be granted to any organization except with our permission acting conjointly with f.10. &amp;) Applications and requests may be submitted to the British Boll.ioal authorities as in Article 6, provided that we see these applications immediately after they have been submitted. h) No objection to the contents of Article 7 * 8. i) It will be better If article 9 were more clearly/.•- 2 - clearly expressed especially that part of it relating to payments to us and to our acknowledged rights from fees end sir charf.es collected from eir transport companies. We agree to the contents of Articles 10, 11 and 12. J) as to Article Id, we do not object to the conu,:nts provided that such authority shall not be exploited for commercial or trade purposes which might be contrary to it (i.e.) for the supp rting of the agents appointed for the purpose of operating the aero drome or aerodromes. k) .rtiole 14 - The expansion of modern aviation, rapidly changing conditions embracing the c rri.ige of passen :ers end goods, and the economic importance thereof should be taicen into consideration, as fur as we are concerned, there are no planes exempt from paymentx of dues except the HA? and, if necessary, military ’planes of governments allied to HKG. ^ We request to see the Chicago Convention of the International Civil Aviation.

He agrees tl on of exemption of other air-craft (i.e. non-rrvWitary) shall be one for subsequent arrangement (vide last sentence Article 14 - Foreign Office Despatch No. SQ^of 17th December, 1948). May I confirm in writing? k) First sentence: this nebuluous phrasing covers a desire for increase in 'royalty 1 payment of £.500 which Shaikh hopes will be considered sympathetically. Beyond promising to represent the point I have not discussed it. I think that a higher payment of say £.1000/- would create favourable irr^ression out of all proportion to small sum involved which might be justifiable in view of depreciation of money value in Kuwait.

We should certainly obtain ARAMCO assurance owing to state of Kuwait airfield* they will not use it for large scale movement of personnel. 2. My misgivings concerning other air operations arise from repeated complaints by BOAC at Basra that they are losing considerable traffic to airline making unauthorized scheduled stops at Kuwait which they advertised only to Oil Companies. I am fairly certain x that TWA operate a weekly schedule into Kuwait on their round the world flight through Damascus and Basra and that SWI3AIR flights have made with a degree of regularity. x . . TWA air craft making scheduled stops at Basra are sometimes sent to Kuwait ahead of BOAC Skymaster if there is traffic offering. Apart from instances of which BOAC complained I am making an independent investigation of air traffic using Kuwait and shall appreciate your advice regarding H.M.C’s attitude towards such operations and towards use of Kuwait with traffic rights thenceforward International Air Lines. 3.

Your despatches 68 of Lecember 17th and 70 of December 24th. The Shaikh has accepted terms of Civil Air agreement and exchange of letters regarding Eoyal Air Force facilities subject to what follows* Article 1. Shaikh originally asked for Insertion of words 'on behalf of His Highness' at the end. He has now dropped this but has asked that the point should be covered by a letter confirming that His Majesty*s Government is acting on his ^ behalf. Is there any objection to this being done? • Shaikh originally wanted provision inserted in all these articles that His majesty** Government would train some of his subjects in technical matters covered by the Articles. He has dropped this but has expressed a hope that the participation and training of Kuwaitis in the matters concerned will t where possible acceptable to His Majesty*s Govern ment. May he be given a general assurance to this effect? Articles &amp; and 6. f Shaikh has asked that he may be kept Informed f of privileges granted. May he be given an I assurance to this effect? Article 14. (a) The Shaikh has made a request for the increase in the annual payment and hopes that it will be considered sympathetically. Galloway is of the opinion that Increase of the payment to say £l y 000 annually would create a favourable impression cut of all proportion to the small sum involved. Further argument is that the present sum is worth much less than it was when it was fixed in 1934. I agree with Galloway's views. May £l t 000 a: nually be offered? (b) The Shaikh insists that no aircraft shall be exempt from payment of duty except Royal Air Force planes and allied military planes and that if exemption from duty of any non-military aircraft is desired the matter will be one for arrangement with him.

It has not yet been decided who will be appointed as agents of H.M.G. for provision of tele communication and we cannot therefore enter into any firm commitment. It is how ever reasonably certain to be either International Aeradio or Cable and Vvireless Ltd. The former employ local labour wherever possible and the latter would presumably do the same.

Article 14. You may for the moment offer £75C annually. While generally in favour of a further increase to £1000 we feel that this cannot be considered apart from the question of exemption of aircraft from payment of duty on fuel. We should be grateful to know whether in view of his statement that 'there are no planes exempted from payment of dues except RaF and military planes of Governments allied to HMG' the Sheikh is prepared to accept the wording of our draft under which not merely BOAC but all British civil aircraft would be exempted; or whether despite the exemption granted to Imperial Airways in the old agreement he is unwilling to exempt / BCAC. However if he is prepared to exempt BCAC we are most reluctant to be faced with a siutation whereby BCAC have a privilege not shared by foreign airlines. In addition to the difficulties under our Civil Aviation Agreements foreign operators concerned ' ^inly allege discri mina tion.

Procedure des- cribed in Tehran Chancery letter No. 26/6/3/4 of Sept., 14th, 1948 is cumbersome, but I do not thinx we should allow the Iranians to escape the consequences of their attitude to us in Kuwait for the slight advantage now offer- S.cfg i (eo oil Company personnel are at present using Cyprus and vw v. the Lebanon as summer resorts.

Puller for your information and comments. With best regards. N. Jackson, Esq. Political Agent Kuwait. AtiwCfc,'/ fyy 4 '- y- ^COPY Head Office 44 George Street London W# 1# OP. i/tac/pgd. H. Puller, Travel Agent, Airport Hotel, Basrah 5th June, 1949. Abdulla Mull a Saleh Esq. , Kuwait. Dear Sir, PROPOSED KUWAIT NA TTn ^A T ‘ ATPLINE* Following our conversation regarding the above, and in accordance with your request, I have pleasure in submitting for your consideration, the outline of a plan for establishing a Kuwait National Airline. Introduction. We have been established as travel agents for about 30 years and specialise in making arrangements for the trans port of personnel and freight on behalf of the Oil Companies and their Contractors. We are the official travel agents for the Kuwait Oil ComDanv in London, we handle the whole of the Anglo Iranian Oi^Corapany’s European passenger traffic, and a S^od proportion of their passenger traffic to the Gulf. We also handle the whole of the Anglo Iranian Oil Company^ airfreight to all parts of the world, and we are the travel agents for the Crown Agents in London. The writer is Manager for A. H. in the Persian Gulf and has a good knowledge of the Middle East and the Persian Gulf in particular as, during the war, he was D.A.D.Tn. for Iraq and Persia. The s oheme has not heen submitted hurriedly, but has been given careful thought an investigation. The whole project is based upon the two following striking factors: (a) the favourable geographical position of Kuwait in relation to the main air routes of the world (b) a tremendous development which will take place in the Persian Gulf in general, and Kuwait in particular on account of the tapping of the tremendous Oil reserves. London Square, Our London address is: A.H. Puller, 44 George Street if. 1. , and our bankers are the Midland Bank, Port man London. Proposed Organisation. Fuller^ would consider providing aircraft, crews, administrative ground staff, and the maintenance repair organisations. Pullers would also provide trained travel personnel to handle the bookings. P. T. 0.Kuwait personnel would *be trained to take over as many posts as possible. Basis for Negotiation. Whilst it is difficult at this time to put forward a definite offer without further investigation and discussion on both sides it may be that we could have as a basis for negotiation a proposal whereby pullers would provide all the facilities, aircraft, plant, etc., as set out under ’‘Proposed O^ganisation ,, in return for a sole concession to operate the Company, which would be named The Kuwait National Airline. You would, of course, have the usual powers of general direction so far as the policy of the Airline was concerned. Routes. Before services could be scheduled, it would be necessa ry to investigate various routes in regard to traffic potential, but the following routes might prove interesting i i) Kuwait/Bahrein/Dhahran. ii) Kuwait/Basrah/feaghdad. iii) Kuwait/India, iv) Kuwait/Aden. v) Kuwait/Damascus/Beirut/Cyprus. Extensions of existing routes for new routes could be operated wherever the traffic offered, as the Kuwait National Airline would have reciprocal rights with all countries whose airlines picked-up, or set-dov/n passengers in Kuwait. Further Advantages. 1 # it is usual for other airlines to entrust their General Agency with the National Airline of the country in which they pick-up or set-down, and any passengers booked An their behalf then carry discount of 10 insxead or per cent. 2. Various ‘’Skyways** aircraft are, at present, on permanent charter to the Kuwait Oil Company, and there is an excellent chance that, if the Kuwait National Airline existed, the Kuwait &lt;ii Oil Company would charter from them. 3 # The various Oil Companies have a considerable amount of special cherter work, and there is no doubt that a good deal of this work would be passed to the Kuwait National Airline as it is ’*one the job* 1 . 4 # The various Oil Companies, including the AIOC, Kuwait Oil Co., etc., also arrange for regular charter aircraft during times of heavy leave traffic, and Kuwait National Airline will have an excellent chance of securing this business. The operation of such an airline would enable its backers, such as your goodself, to secure all the regular vegetable, fruit and perishable traffic contracts with the various Oil Companies in the Gulf. P. T. 0,GENERAL REMARKS* - 3 - You will appreciate, I am sure, tkat the at&gt;ove notes cJi only serve as a Dias Is for our discussion, as it is obvious that, 'before any firm offer could Le made on either side, a considerable amount of investigation mast take place. Another factor which I have not touched on, is •f*o^+nr» of orestige. and there is no doubt that an efficient airline would increase the prestige of Kuwait.

C/255(6/10) Dear 3ir Hupert, S'.q; K'U ^ Nov; that the new CJivil Air Agreement has been signed it will be necessary to apply the revised Air Navigation Regulations to persons subject to our jurisdiction by a Ring’s Regulation issued under Article 85 of the Kuwait Order in Council. The former King’s Regulation - No. 1 of 1936 - applied ^ir Navigation Rules made by the SheiKh. According to our new agreement Kuwait is to be regarded for the purposes of international civil aviation as United Kingdom territory; and this changeis reflected in the draft ling’s Regulation which I enclose for your consideration. It is self-contained in that the Regulations and Conditions cantained in the two Annexes attached to the Heads of .agreement: have been incorporated in the body of the King’s Regulation. These two annexes were sent out by the foreign Office with their letter Np. 68(W 7389/3/802) dated 17th December, 1948 to you and it appears from paragraph 3 of that letter that they have been examined in London and brought into line with modern requirements. 2. The definition of ’’authorised person*’ contained in Article 15(a) of Annex 1 read with Articles 1(1) and 2 of the Heads of Agreement appears to me to mean that the Quarantine Helical Officer should carry out the Air Sanitary formalities, that the Sheixh’s customs and passports officials are to implement the customs and passports/ H.E. Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE., CSI., Political Resident, Persian OiiLf Residency, Bahrain.passports regulations, and that the supervision necessary to give effect to the Air Navigation Regulations is intended to be carried out by His Majesty’s Governments agents and their employees. Section 16 of the King’s Regulation is intended to mak:e this clear. 3. A penalty clause (section 17) for unauthorised landings has also been included to be collected as an extraordinary landing fee without the necessity for legal proceedings, unless the pilots of the offending aircraft or the local agents of the airlines refuse to pay it. You might lixe to consider whether a penal landing fee of Rs. 100/- is reasonable or excessive. Paragraph 3 of your letter No. 26/123/49 of the 9th July to the Foreign Office 4. It will be necessary to asx His Highness to pass parallel legislation applying these rules to Kuwait subjects and to corporations that I thintc will have to be regarded as Kuwait subjects when in Kuwait - my letter No. C/231 of the 17th September, 1949, refers. Middle Hast Airlines, Iranian Airways, Iraqi Airways, Saudi Arabian Airlines and Misr Airways and la Gampagnie General de Transport, for instance, come into this category; and, should it be necessary for His Majesty’s Government’s agents in charge of the aerodrome to prosecute them for breaches of the Air Navigation Regulat ions they would, I thinx, have to do so in accordance with « Part VI of the Kuwait Order in Council unless of course they prosecuted the companies’ pilots - most of whom are British subjects or Foreigners - in their personal capacity. I have spoken to His Highness and he would have no objection to passing parallel legislation. refers Yours ever Sgd. G.N. Jacxson.Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain.

I also asked that I should be burnished with draft Class II Notars in respect of all aerodrores. I was told while I was at horre that ry letter was under consideration with the ’Ministry of Civil ' Aviations. enclosure to Nurrajr of the General Department of the Foreign Office in the hope that the ministry of Civil Aviation ray find your draft Regulation of use fnd that the paper will serve to remind them that a reply to ry I referred the whole question of the control I ar forwarding a copy of your letter and its letter of July is awaited'.
