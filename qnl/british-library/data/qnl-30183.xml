Yhe retail price of 10a wheat bread to be sold by bakers was fixed by the Municipality at r?ials 3 per kilo. This price was at the end of last week reduced to Hiala 1.80 per kilo.

Strenuous efforts are new being made to get landlords and peasants to declare their true surpluses of wheat and barley, ’''he monopolisation of barley is generally condemned by landlords, peasants, and officials alike. 2O 0 Fresh eouixma for sugar have now been issued in Shlras, and one or two of the provincial towns.

A reliable and first hand report received from tarhang (see para. 11 above) is to the effect that the food position in Laris tan la very bad. He gave an illustration of what was happening there:— Borne time sgo he had come to hhiras and dis cussions were held about the taeans of bringing food to Lnr. The requirement© of the area are 12, 00 tons of grain, on a basis of 100 kilos per head for the year. 24. as a result of discussions with the Governor General and the Director of the Vinance Department it was agreed that thv wheat of the SAB’ivH district ( should be left to him to collect for the requirement of bar. He formed c Conpany with a capital of Rials 500,000 for the xurchaaw of wheat and barley.

The price of bread had been further reduced. It was thought that the Province would need to import at least 4,000 tons of wheat to meet the whole year’s requirements.

INTERNAL SECURITY. 2. During the fortnight under review attacks by robber bands seem more or less to have been confined to one particular point viz at Chihil Cheshme (Km.216) (See preceding diaty paragraph b). 3. On August 2nd a United Kingdom Co snercial Corporation contracted truck travelling to Shiraz was waylaid at .30 a.- . at thdabove spot. The driver tried to get away but was fired on and his mate, an Armenian, killed instantly. The driver was tnep blindfolded, beaten and robbed. 'Che load was not touched. 4. On August 10th the drivers of two Uni ted Kingdom Co- erci al Corporation truck and one other lorry reported having been sto &gt;ped by about 40 bandits at between 12.00 hour® and 13. u nours at the same place and to have been robbed of their cash and belongings. Road guards subsequently appeared from asht-i- ^r.jan ^ ,0:; and Khan-i-2inian but by then the robbers had decamped and no attempt was made to follow them up. 5 It is to be feared thaispnly half hearted atte ps are made by the amnieh officers and men to cope with the robber bands on the road 6. On the 13th August at Chihil Cheshme a truck war ing on a sub contract with &gt;. essrs. Saab &amp; Co., contractors to : essrs. Kampsax i on road work was stopped and two new tyres ere looted# Motor tyres are now worth over £100 apiece. The driver was also looted. 7. On the same date at 23.00 hours the amnieh po&amp;t at Km.234, Bhah Saltaneh was attacked by ba dits in force ard it is believed that the five amnieh and five chiriks in the post surrendered and were stripped of their uniforms, rifles and ammunitions. 8. On the 14th August at Tul-i-Duzd (Km*240) 2 amnieh and 8 chiriks were held up by robbers and deprived of their rifles and a munition, and the uniforms of the two amnieh were also taken. 9. Sundry instances have been reported of depredations by marauding Qashqai and Mamassani and Boir Ahmadl robbers in the surrounding county districts. X n one case the ev. dharp, of the C*M.S*Shiraz was asleep on the roof of a house in the village of Husseinabad, about a mile from Kaqsh-i-iustam, when he was awakened to see three flocks of sheep each of about 200 a amals being driven off by a number of mounted men with rifles. The flocks belonged to the neighbouring village of Shul. 10 ...Ji page 2. 10. In the course of a recent conversation the iover iOr-Oeneral informed His Majesty’s Consul that the Shiraz prison was *^11 of highway rohhers many of whom had 'been captured flagrante delicto with ar is in their hands. In certain cases the lo c ®l court had imposed the death penalty but as such verdicts required confirmation and approval by the Military Tribuna! in Tehran no . 1 executions had been carried out simply because he could never o' ' ( ^ replies from Tehran to his references to higher authori-ty. lh t^ ib most prejudicial to the maintenance of good oruer and seci rity. 4 TRIBAL. 11. Nasir Qashqai has retimed to the Firuzabad area and was t last located at Baba Ruh near Xhajei anc not far froi^ Kavar. i-ere on August 1st he received ;'r. Ra matulla Ghavami, Ao iristrative Manager of the Anglo—Iranian Oil Co. , it*, at as jid—i—Suleiman. He reiterated his ref^isal to trust himself to the Persian Govern ment but expressed his readiness to allow any responsible British Official to visit any of his territory in order to disprove stories of his harbouring Germans or constructing landing grounds etc., He also declared himself ready to submit to the British Government provided he received a written guarantee ol his safety. 12. His Majesty’s Consul has received visits from the following Iviamassani tribal khans: 1; ^ehangir JOhan Dushmanziari 2) Khalil Khan Javid N 3 ) uha mad Khan Bakish. All three desired to affirm their obedience to the Persian Government and to the British and to offer their services to the British Authorities whenever required. 13. The Governor-Ge leral has, he stated to His Majesty’s Consul/ proposed to the Prime Minister the appointment of Colonel Akhagar as Military Governor of the Qashqai, and that the gashqai have agreed to this a pointment. In view of the fact that the Persian Government are not actually in control of the Piruzabad area, and to obtain such control would have to occupy Firuzabad, a step which the General Officer Commanding feels himself not quite strong enough to do yet, the appointment of a military Governor and the consent of the tribes thereto seems unreal. SCGNOMIC SITUATION. 14. Mr. J.F.P.Vaughan Russell, Consular Liaison Officer ad interim, attached to this Consulate, has paid a flying visit to Fasa, Jahrum and Darab, in oreer to investigate the position in regard to the collection of surplus wheat for Cover imen-t. r. Russell reports a very unsatisfactory state of affairs and shows that very little effort is being made by the finance department Officials to enforce the handing over of surplus totals or the anti-hoarding regulations. lb. Hr. Russell received authority to distribute some five hundred tomans worth of food and clothing material to the destitute poor of Fasa. As previously reported the state of these miserable people is deplorable, and the first attempt by I r. Russell and the local authorities to cii&amp;ribute bread resulted in a inad uncontrollable rush of starving 4Lople. 16. The most profitable (to the allied cause) fori of propaganda that could be carried in the Southern regions of Tars would be themmm i3age 3. early despatch of British Officers with van loads of.food sugar, tea) and clothing materials and medicines to these areas, 'RSIAH ATHLETICS ■ ' ' ' 17. On August 10th (19th Murdad) a sports gathering was held in Shiraz under the patronage of Prince ’iruz at the sports ground opposite the Hafizieh. Invitations were issued by the ‘y^irector of education to His Majesty’s Consul and staff, his \ / jesty’s Consul could not attend owing to indisposition but His Majesty’s Vice Consul reported a very pleasing display of various forms of sport including wrestling and ancient hand to hand fighting, the participants being dressed in ancient costumes.

Unfortunately owing to the transference of responsibility from the Department of Finance to the newly created and staffed Department of Food there has been regrettable and serious interference with the machinery for acquiring wheat # rice and other foodstuffs with the result that much of the grain that would have been obtained for Shiraz has been smuggled out of the district to Isfahan and Yezd WEATHER 15 # From November 16th to December 13th the total recorded rainfall In Shiraz measures .72 inches.

His Majesty's Consul accompanied by His Majesty's ^*W»€onsul and the Area Liaison Officer and his Munehi, and ^ o—CoiiBul and the Consulate Munshi, called by appointment on Sipahbod Shahbakhti on February 17th. The Sipahbod returned the call on His Majesty’s Consul on February 20th. 2. Sartip Muhammad Nakhjawan aeneral O^leer Commanding Isfahan has returned to Isfahan. He was accompanied by the White Russian Captain de Werba who had come down to Shiraz in the Sipahbod's party. 3. It appears that the Sipahbod has g'ven orders to his staff that Persian military officers are to abstain contacts with British officials. 4. Sartip Firouz. ex: TTstandar o-^ the 7th Ustan. and General Officer Commanding 6th (Southern) Lashkar. left Shiraz for Tehran on February 25th, o ^icially on fifteen days leave of absence. He was accompanied by Princess T, irouz, and clearly had no intention of returning to Shiraz to con^tyiue his military command. 5. Sarhang II Azizulla Razmju recently arrived in Shiraz to join the 6th (Southern) Division. Tie is reported as having taken over charge of the Military Police. He was at one time a personal follower of the late Farman Farina and was a leader of a body of sowars. TRIBAL• —on February 25th the Sipahbod issued a proclamation which it was his intention, (so he informed His Majesty s Consul to distribute over tribal territory by means of aeroplanes. According to information furnished by Salar Afkham Qashgai the latter, on orders from the Sipahbod, has sent o^f couriers to the leading Khans of the Qashquli, Darashuri, Shishbuluki and Farsimadan sections of the iashgai, with a letter from himself covering copies of the proclamation, and calling upon these Khans to take note of the Sipahbod's manifesto, and to withdraw from association with the rebels, and to submit to the Government, and that if they comply at once their past misdeeds will be “orgotten. • : 7. The Sipahbod's proclamation contains a warning to -U^idwaatoiious and X profit seeking persons’' and calls on the Blflo. POL DEPf.! ^ x q MAY’S^3the * *.« Khedkhudas and Falantara to let it be known that anyone with a grievance can, 'with full hope of receiving justice” make their petitions to 'Commanders of the Headquarters of Detachments' or to him direct. n he proclamation warns that any disturbers o*’ the p~ace by obtaining arms etc. , will be severely dealt with and their assets shall be confiscated to recompense farmers who have suffered at their hands. 8. r ^he Sipahbod has expressed the Indention sending to Nasir a deputation to consist of one orjriore army officers (perhapc Sardar Bahadur) and Aeht^ii and Amir Hussein Khan Qashgai (eldest son the late Sardar Thteshaa and consequently first cousin of Muhammad Nasir Qashgai' to give Nasir and Khosrow a ^ast cbance of submitting peacefully to Government. Up to { he 28th February this deputation had not left Shiraz for Hruzabad. 9. On the Kawar - Firuzabad road seven stretches of the road in the vicinity of the Shah Hahrami pass, each otretch'measuring from 1? to 21 metres, have been torn up by the Qashgai. In addition the road has been much damaged by the recent heavy rain. SECURITY. 10* No robberies or attempts at interference with traffic or labour on the main road have been reported. According to a report furnished by Sarhang Salar Khosrowdad, Chief of the Gendarmerie of fare, a band of fourteen robbers robbed a caravan last week (16th to 23rd February N at Poozeh- i—Kamarzard near Ramjird (some 40 miles North of Shiraz . The gendarmerie post at Pul-i-Khan was informed and a detachment went out and engaged the robbers killing one, wounding one, and cauturing eight. The robbers were *ashgai, 11 . Again on February 24th some 30 armed and unanted robbers attacked a caravan at Abambar-Surkeh near Dashti- Arjin (on the Shiraz- azerun road). The gendarmerie H»6«0* at Galu-Khwajeh took out a party of his men, made contact and captured two of the robbers and their rifles and recovered all the robbed goods. These robbers were ’arsima- dan. , , . 12* During Dahman 1321 (21/1/43 - 19/2/43' 31 robberiei took place in the province of ^ars. In ’b cases 'be robbers were pursued and most of the .^oods recovered. 6 cases only was it not possible to make contact with the r &lt;yboys. 13. On February 25th a circular notice was issued bym I'i t - 3 - »lr&gt;M the Chief of Staff of the 6th (Southern^i^ision to landlords and village owners strictly enjoining them to issue urgent instructions to all their Kedkhudas or agents to report to them at once in the interests of military security, without Joss of tine, any event contra/ry to security, e.g. in^ormaticn the presence of* movement of rohhers, he landlords and village owners are to pass on the information without loss of time to Divisional Headquarters or to the nearest military or gendarmerie post. Full cooperation in this respect is demanded, ECONOMIC SITUATION, 14. ,r, here is little change to report. Crop prospects are good. The general 'bread situation in Shiraz continues reasonably fair. According to latest information available, a deficit of 3,000 tons of grain is probable before next harvest. The idea of a central bakery and rationing by coupons for bread seems dead, and perhaps it Is better so. 15. On February 03rd the Sipahbod summoned all the bakers of the town, and in the presence of the Shahrdar (Matfor. and the Head of the Food Department, threatened them with condign punishment if the baking of the bread and its supply to the populace was not radically Improved. ^ 16. There has been a s^o^tage in the food Department s supply of sugar for Rahman (21/1/43 H to 19/2/43, owing, allegedly .to short delivery frnm the sugar factory at ?;ervdash Consequent on orders from the Sipahbod the Factory has now delivered the goods, and coupon holder* are getting -heir mite For Bahman.

Captain J.B. Howes, Secretary to the political Resident in the Persian (Vulf and His M$esty s Consul, Bush ire, visited Shiraz from February 25th to February 28th, BRITISH MILITARY MOVFMFNTS^ 2U A party of three British Officers and fourteen othei ranks are believed to have passed through Shiraz on the 19th February. The identity of this party is not itnown but there is a vague report that they went to Bushire in connexion with defence measures against locusts. 22. Brigadier Douglas, Rifle Brigade, Persia Area Commander, accompanied by Captain Chapman, guides Cavalry and twelve other ranks arrived*** Shiraz on February 2^th and left the following day for Bushire. RUSSIAN INTERESTS. 23, Mr. Tvan Salpin, announcing himself as Russian ice- Consul at Isfahan, called on His Majesty’s Consul on February 13th. He stated he was visiting Bushire and promised to inform Hie Majesty’s Consul of his return so that some hospi tality could be arranged. He again passed through Shiraz on February 20th but without telling His Majesty’s Consul, on his way to Isfahan. On both trips he apparently refused to give....5 1943, I give his name or parti cnlars of his party at the Police harrier 24. A number of Russian lorry drivers were seen in the town and caused some trouble for the Police who complained of tlf^ir brawling and drunkness, and asked His Majesty’s Consul ^at they should do with them. The Police were advised to hand ^ men over to. their officer i^ there was one, if not to keep them in the Police Station until they had cooled down, hut not to delay any convoy movement. The Police also complained that these Russians refused to stop at the town barrier and drove through the barrier chain. PUBLIC WORKS. 25.

See below under 'Tribal”. - ) TRIBAL. 2. On May 22nd, at dawn, General S^ahbakhti's columns at Lar and Jahrum, Kavar and Kazerun began a concerted move in the direction of Firuzabad, the declared object being to re establish Persian Government control over Firuzabad, the centre of the ^ashgai tribal territory, and to effect, by degrees, the disarming of the tribal gunmen. Another column under Sarhang Barkhodar was started off from Shiraz two days later to move up the Siakh-Kumareh valley, from Khan-i-Zinian (about 30 miles along the Bushire road from Shiraz. This column has since, for some as yet unfathomed reason, been brought back to Shiraz. 3. Practically no reliable information is available from any source, official or otherwise, as to the real progress of the operations, but there is reason to believe that whereas the Lar and Jahrum and Kazerun columns have made reasonable progress, the main column under Sarhang Sardar Bahadur, Bakhtiari operating from Kavar has met wih some resistance and has not got beyond Muk to date. The mere fact that Firuzabad has not yet been occupied - after ten days — by the Government troops, seems to indicate that all is not entirely well. 4. Since the meeting mentioned in paragraph 8 of Shiraz diary No.9, a further meeting has occurred on 24th May at Kaleh Zanganeh (map reference 1940 i' sheet H-39-P 7485) between Colonel V.G.Robert, Senior Liaison Officer, Shiraz, accompanied by Major R. Jackson, Area Liaison Officer, Shiraz and Elyas and Jehangir Quli Kashkuli. Both Khans seemed uncertain « of their future attitude but said that the tribes would resist attempts at disarmamentj they disclaimed any threat to convoys but warned that operations might inevitably lead to cutting of the road. ; They said they would however go to Firuzabad and unaer themselves would come in and submit* 1 hey also promised that 4^ o£&lt;£«« B , tep8 • * ‘' f oJ, o_Jn) steps would 'be taken to send the Germans out of Qashgai tribal territory when they could he ’’picked up” by the British* Resulti.are unlikely. # ^ x ^ 5* Qawam-ul-Mulk, (see paragraph one above) has come to Shiraz to see whether by his tribal influence he can assist r^eral Shahbakhti to bring about a solution of the increasing ly dangerous situation in Pars* He is now taking his bearings. INTERNAL SECURITY. 6. So far no untoward incidents have occurred on the main Isfahan - Shiraz - Bushire road which can be attributed to the commencement of tribal operations. The usual passage of the tribes with their flocks and families and escorts has however inevitably resulted in a certain amount of pillagln^, on their line of march* 0^ May 25th a village - proper y called Kundazi about 106 kirns, north north west of ohiraz was looted of its flocks. Other villages and properties damaged and robbed are Khollar, where the best wine comes from, Polak and Habashabad in the Baiza area, Rezabad and Chemeh KuehiK all north-west of Shiraz. ™ 7* No reports of damage as a result of the migration of the Khamseh have come in but on May 22nd three Russian lease—lend lorries were held up near Saadetabad by robbers a* believed to be Arabs.

A report received from the Garrison Eggmeer too late for inclusion in the preceeding diary is to the effect that on May 12th a gang of robbers attacked and robbea tne s ..ore keeper in charge of labourers tools in camp near rharagaj.

From information which has subsequently corn*- -- it seems clear that on their first attempt at an advance from LAVaR on J ay 22nd or 25rd this column was pretty severely handled by the iashqai who under Kasir and Khosrow haa ^ concentrated more or less their main strength consisting of not more than 600 to 900 well armed men - horse an- iool. The troops were defeated am&gt; retired in considerable dxoorae., losing at least eighty rifles. 1 ad the ipashqai &amp;een a disciplined force they could have kept the troops on t.ie run to Kavar if not to ohiraz. They however stopped to -cot the socils and in the meantime word came of the military advance in the *IR ana lARZIU area, so Lhosrow ^ashqai went Oxf with 300 to 400 men to deal with that threat* 5. It was the bringing up of reinforcements and che four 105 mm. guns which, it is reported, did much damage to the ashqai sangars that eventually on t;une 9th and 10th •nut the tribesmen, including i asir, to flight. 6* From June 11th until about June 26th uhe . ersian troops have shown little activity though reports Ox a certain amount of disarming in th- various centres hare come in.

He remains in Shiraz as Finance Director, TRIBAL. r J ^ ie p as .k fortnight has been an eventful one.^ Contacts made between Khosrow Qashqai and the Governor of Bakhtiari resu - ted in Murteza t^juli Khan’s son Jehanshah seeing Khosrow and Nasir ashqai at a Qashqai camp near Abadeh on August 5 th. Jehanshah i accompanied by MAJID KHAN BAKHTIAR son of Saraar M0AK2AM) Came to Shiraz, at the request of Sarlashkar ehanbani, on August oth and reported the purport of his interview with Khosrow an Nasir. 5. This report was made sufficiently encouraging to warrant a meeting between the principal Qashqai^ bandits and Morteza Quli Khan and Sarlashkar Jehanbani and one was accor dincly approved to take place at KALEVAR on Augus t Hth • Colonel V.G.Robert,Senior Liaison Officer, whose presence had, it appears, been asked for by Nasir, also attended the meeting. The outcome of this meeting was that Khosrow, on signed assurances of immunity from arrest, given by both General Jeharibani and Colonel Robert, agreed to accompany General Jehanbani to ohiraz on August 12th and on the following day to Tehran to discuss the possibilities of a settlement on the basis of terms provisionally agreed at Kalevar by General Jehanbani in a document, signed, by him and the Qashqai, viz: (l) a surrender of the automatic wea pons, guns and other equipment (rifles were WOT mentioned) a, SEMIRUM (2) Khosrow to be recognised as Head oi the Qashqai tribe (3) Nasir to be allowed to live freely where he liked. There was also a verbal understanding that no obstacle would be put in the ? / a v&amp;x ucijl. -o o/ A)** wa yI way of Nasir seeking election as a deputy in the Majlis for Piri^ahad. Colonel Robert accompanied the party to Tehran. 5* These provisional terms if they are slightly amplified co include the surrender of a substantial number of rifles robbed, at various times from G-overnment forces,do provide a possible foundation for a settlement, (though it be only of a provisional nature) especially if it be clearly realised that, as matters are at present, the Persian military forces are in no shape to quell the Qashqai and the Boir Ahmedi solely by punitive measures. The question of the surrender of the Germans at present known or believed to be with the Qashqai is one to be handled with care and cannot be adamantly pressed, if an issue is desired. 7. A provisional settlement on the above basis will at least provide Qawar, ul Mulk and Jehanbani with a breathing space to develop their plans (if they can make any) for further action later* But there will be few illusions as to the honesty of purpose of these Qashqai whose capacity and reputation for falsehood and deceit seems rivalled only by that of the average Persian military officer* INTERNAL SECURITY. ~1T* In general this may now be said lo be non existent in most parts of Pars west ana south of the main road from Abadeh to Kazerun. Plundering of villages,crops, and animals continues indiscriminately. On August 14th a big village in Baiza named BANESH is reported to have been robbed by Kashkuli tribesmen. Pour villagers were killed. 9. The town of ARDEKAN situated on the borders of the Kuhgulu country was attacked on or about August 5th by bands of Boir Ahmedi tribesmen under Ali and Vali Qaed Qivi (see Shiraz diary No*13 para ll) and (it is said) Muhammad Hussein son of Sartip Khan* Through the treachery of Seyed Agha Hashemi a notoriously disloyal local Kalantar who had enlisted a band of 30 (thirty; chirik s who had been issued with arms by the mili tary authorities of Shiraz, the Boir Ahmedi were allowed into one end of the town which they completely sacked. 10. The garrison however stood fast and the young lieutenant in command refused to surrender when called upon to do so. On the night of the 5th August a battalion was sent off from Shiraz to assist the beleaguered garrison and in due course the attackers cleared off* The treacherous Seyed Agha Hashemi has since been arrested and his 30 gunmen disbanded and their rifles recovered.

(12) On 28th 0 Nov. the G.OX. made his first visit to the Mamassani Khans, Just before he left he informed HJI. Consul that he had three objects in view; (a) to show friendship to the Mamassani and dissident (i.e* from Abdullah Khan Zargampur) Khans of the Boir Ahmedi; (b) to investigate the Mcamassan:’ land claims: and (c) to examine the prospect of forming an anti-tashgai bloc after explaining to them that Nasir Khan was not the if Oreat Protector' of Pars. (13) His visit certainly did good, and, up to the moment, there is no accusation that he collected any cash. As regards the Mamassani land claims. General Jehanbani read to the assembled ^hans the judgement brought down from rn ehran by Tbtahaj es Swltaneh which was to the effect#' that certain lands were to be banded over to the heirs of Haji Muin ut Tujjar. This, news provoked a great uproar, and the Khans vowed they would never agree to such a course. On his return the General lamented the weakness and stupidity of previous Govern ments who had not arrived at an equitable solution of this problem which had troubled relations between the Mamassani and the Government for the last forty-five years* He said that the dossier contained no pleadings or explanations on behalf of the Mamassani, and in his view Haji’ Muin’s claim was entirly unjustified. He added that he would propose that the Government adopt one or other of the following solutions; (a) That Government should buy out Bushiri’s claim at the price declared for registration purposes of 500,000 Tomans, and either sell or lease the lands to the Khans. (b) That the heirs of Bushiri should be brought here, and forced to sell out their claims at an equitable price to the Khans. It seems certain that the adoption of either would enable the Mamassani to cultivate more put them mere in the hands of the Government the Qashgai, of these suggestions 1 and, and th e r e f o re against the Bo.At and (14) As regards the political value of Mae Mamassani bloc, the G.O.C. expressed satisfaction. He net all the Mamassani chiefs and considered Hussain luli Kustami the most important and interest ing from his point view. He claims that he fully explained td) him that Nasir Khan was -ot the Protector of Pars, and on that basis Concluded an agreement that he would protect the Hanassani against the B 0 A1 in the event of a threatened attack, by despatching soldiers and additional rifles to arm tribesmen. This statement is partly confirmed by a reasonably trustworthy Persian source. Other Tr hans. in a letter written before this interview, deny that the g.o.CM even mentioned the name of Nasir. Further infermatimn is being sought* (15) General Jehanbani also met M'd Hussain, son of Sartip Khan B.A. whom he considered as a young and impulsive man but of interest against Abdullah Khan, He also met .ill Kaidgiveh. who put himself at the G.O.C, T s disposal. By chance the 0.0,C. was able to put his offer to test by asking him to kidnap the Germans sheltered bKantiy a.K.Z, , and the General wearied of broken gashgai promises, ztwtf'.por decided to put the plan into execution,. Details of this plan were given to the interested parties* As there was some danger cf A.K.Z. seeking his revenge for the kidnapping, the 0, r ' C C, i a sending 200 soldiers and additional rifi.es to Fehlian to protect any region .menaced by A.K.Z, But the G.O.C*’s plan has another aspect. If the F.aidgiveh do kidnap the Germans y there will be more bad blood between them and A.K.Z., and the latter 1 will be unable to send tribesmen to help the Bahm^i when they are attacked by the Persian Armyo (16) in general there are signs that General Jehanbani may now think that it^is possible to isolate the gashgai and so weaken / f V O • l ‘them that the Amy is capable of disarming them, perhaps, in the Spring.

He claimed that he had sent a message^ to Nasir T,r han asking him to surrender Ali tJid expressing surprise that Nasir shOb Id shelter still another enemy of the Government. He confessed that Nasir had taken no action* ( 7 ^ ppo G o 0-C a also said that he had asked Salar Hishmat Ali Khan Qashgai (titular head of tne Shishbuluki and a traditional, enemy of Nasir’s father and of Nasir himse f) to fetch Ali Ismail in. but that Ali Khan had stipulated that he required two or three^ hundred tufangehis to do so 0 H.M,Consul pointed out that Ali Khan request was probably based on two considerations:(a; desire to nrotect his life from Nasir who would certainly murder him, and (*) to accomplish his mission he would need to show that instead of being a disgraced man he was honoured by the Persian Government so that ''his tribe wo^ld not fear they would lose ^materially by deserting Nasir and rallying to the'i r traditional chief.

During the ^ tr/n a tribes in Tehran there were indications that the Khans ^he two tri had no faith in the General or his promises to settle lan claims. The first indication was furnished by ^ given to the two British Liaison officers and a British military doctor who went into Mamassani country on 11th. December. Most the Khans, notably Hassain Quli Rustumi (see Diary No. ^ para. 14) went out of their way to avoid meeting the British officers, and refused to give or hire them horses to continu their journey. Furthermore one Liaison officer on his return reported that there was considerable traffic betweenRustuni, Abdullah Zargampur, and certain Darashuri Khans and that Rustu^ had received a small present of arms from Zargampur. This extra ordinary behaviour to visitors, and especially to a d^tor come ,o work among them, is in marked contradiction to the tribal trad ition of hospitality,, The only explanation the writer can advanc. is that the Khans in question, seeing that the General has alwa^ been so friendly to the Qashgai, and having no fa ith in Persian promises anyway, believe that the General will settle their land claim in favour of the heirs of Hajji Muin ut Tuojar, who was always a friend of Soulat ed Douleh, the father of Uasir and Khosrow. They further believe that the.G.O.C. will send troops (as has been done on several occasions in the past forty years) to enforce the Bushiris claims. On this hypothesis, the Mamassani,feeling obliged to resist the Persian army and the possible infiltration qashgai influenceneed all the friends they can find. Their natural and racial friends are the^oir Ahmedis, and so they are unwilling to risk a Blood feud with A.K.Z. by helping to kidnap the Germans from his territoryas Rustumi and All Kaidgiveh had agreed to do). Following this armment, the Khans wished to avoid seeing British officers whose mission might well be to ask them to activate the plans ^or kidnapping the Germans. (9) On or about 25th. Dec, Khosrow Khan qashgai, pro fessing shame and anger that his emissaries to A.K.Z. had failed dismally even to see that chief, expressed the desire to^go and see him himself, and expressed every confidence that he would succeed. It was obviously essential not to refuse any^promising chance to capture the Germans c If KHcsrow Khan qashgai were to succeed, well and good? if not he could be taunted into taking further and probably more vigorous action to secure our enemies. On the other*hand, if his offer were refused, K.K.q. could always ar°-ue that v/e had refused to allow him to act as he thought best, and the responsibility for the capture of the Germans was now on the British and not on the Qashgai. Therefore, before k.L.,). could change his mind, he was allowed to go to see A.K.Z. via the Mamassani, but he was warned, and promised not to indulge in any talk about land with the Khans. So far, the result of his mission to A.K.Z. is not known, but, as feared, he seems to have talked about the Mamassani lands, (10) On 26th u Dec 0 reports reached Shiraz that K.K.U. had told the Mamassani Khans that he was taking over from tin* heirs of Haji Muin two thirds of the lands awarded them by the Court. The reaction of the Khans was very marked, and runners sped to Shiraz to discover the truth and to tell the world they would fight for their j.anut&gt; 0 (11) On 30the Dec. a further messenger arrived to say that K.K.Q, was saying that he had received a telegram from the G.O.Co instructing him to take over Bushiris land in the name of the qashgai. The report also said that Khfcsrow was threatening a union of the Boir Ahmedis and the Rashguli and Darashurris (fractions of the Qashgal) to enforce his !, rights. ,, (12) On 30th. Deo 0 H.M.Consul discussed the general situation with the G.O.C. The latter first said that he had given orders to 0ol o Humayuni to send his troops from Behbehan to Khairabad to prevent any attack by the B.A. on ARU. The General added that he would welcome the chance to attack the B,A./f (A*) rri^g q. Q Co was very angry v/ith what he felt was the treachery of Rnstumt and the Mamassani, and denied ^ig^ously thl reports^that Khosrow Khan would ac^ire rights in the Mamass-. that Government could not give the Bnshiri claimants ^alue elsewhere (even the reduced value M^fonsul’s hints, ^or registration purposes) I^^^fgn^an'Uhe expert SASS-rKtrj.S.iS*'™! ssrpScd rs' p™ ss to Mamassani might precipitate armed hostility, agreed with this view, (14'» The G.O.C, also said that he had received a telegraam from A.K.Z. claiming that he had preserved °ger in the B.A. t ltor ,„ an(3 asicing that the operations against the TAIBI he called°off In reply the General said that as Tehran had called the operation off anyhow, he was sending a reply ask ng .e. to surrender the Germans as a proof of his good intentions. /At * &amp; 1 on V*t&gt; ? - ELECTIONS. (15&gt; One of the G.O.C.’s declared intentions in going tn^phran was to get definite instructions as to the list ol Government candidates c He said that elections ^ e b C ^Q ne begin. Prom Tehran he telegraphed asking t about elections until his return. Since. in .^J^elv in nothing can be done without him. as all power is ^ his hand, official electioneering was suspended. The Qashg however, were busy forwarding their claims, (16) in Abadeh, difficulties soon began. The Governor had received instructions to forward the candidature of Rezavi, Government ticket holder.

Perhaps the greatest opposition centres around a divine called Seyid Nur-ed-Din, who has twice been expelled ircm Shiraz for his revolutionary tendencies.

Furthermore, the tc.fi is not yet consuming 25$ barley, and probably cannot be induced to do so until after the elections. (13) , In these circumstances, the authorities declared themselves unable to deliver wheat for the moment. It seems certain, however, that there is still wheat to be collected here given energy, flexibility of methods, and transport. IRANIAN MILI TARY . (14) 0 During the period under review, Col.

There seems no doubt that these men are in contact with the Tudeh party a Closely allied to them, biit not quite one of them, is Pazorgad, a Tehran editor, who is appealing rather successfully to the youth and ”intelligentia” of Shiran* ( 8 ) . The Seyyid T s own operations in town were to frighten the ignorant, and especially the alleged converted Jews, into surren dering their identity cards preparatory to voting for the Seyyid’s list* Armed with this weapon, he obtained mon y from merchants who, as a result of profiteering, had acquired wealth and now wished to acquire social position, to broaden his field* Similarly, he ob tained money from Nasir Qashgai to obtain votes for him in Shiraz town where Nasir - 7 s wr as much as Ts 0 40,000, and started to bleed another merchant* Towards the end of the month the Seyyid openly said that if he is elected, he will resign if the candidate who is sixth on the list (and who automatically fills any vacancy) makes it worth his while* (9) „ This powerful threat to the Govt* candidates naturally dismayed the Acting G.G a and Zul Qadr. the QawarrJs electoral rep it does not run* From one merchant he obtained and then informed him that he could not stand, resentative* They telegraphed to Qawam and the expulsion of the three Govt, servants* to the P.Mo , vino ordered Two were expelled, but Riahi remained, although there were stories current to the effect that he had robbed the sugar factory to the extent of Ts 0 200,000 for electoral expenses* It appears he has resigned (bn order to carry on his political activities, but expects to be re-employed if he is not elected* There is also some evidence to shov/ that the Govt, ordered the expulsion of Seyyid Nur ed Din, hut, if so, the G.O.C. has not seen fit to do so; (10)* But the most powerful threat to the election of Govt* candidates and to the peace of the province - ice, Nasir Fhan - remains uncurbed. On 29th, Jan. the G.o.C, informed NJTGonsul that the P e K, telegraphed to him the previous day stating that the Shah and the Govt, totally disapprove of the candidature of Nasir for Shiraz, despite the offer to surrender some rifles etc (see para. 5). When H.M,Consul called on the o.n.C, the latter was dis inclined to obey this order, but eventually the G.r.C. agreed to eliminate Nasir* Later that evening he asked if the A.L.O. could be sent to see Nasir and confirm that the Iranian Govt* had rejec ted his candidature. This request was refused. (ll\ That same day - Jan, 29th,- the G.O.,C» informed H.M. Consul that the Govt, (he admitted after pressure that it was the Shah) had instructed him to secure the election of ANWAR and N TT HAZZA.B for Shiraz in place of DEHRAN and IMAM JUMAA. Another source cf reasonable reliability Informed H.M.Consul that the Shah had also ordered the G.0 c C o to secure the election of ABBAS KHALILI, editor of the Tehran paper IQDAM for Jahrum. (12^. H.M,Consul persuaded the GcO.G, and subsequently the Acting G.G. to telegrcBph to Tehran that, as elections had begun, it was too late to secure the election of new candidates* (Id). When H.M.Consul called on the A.G.G, and Zul Qadr on 31st. Jan. to ascertain the position, they stated that the G.O.C. had given Nasir notice that he could not be elected for Shiraz, and that he had given Col, Khosrowdad (head of the gendarmerie) orders to prevent votes from being cast for Nasir. They said they saw that provided the G.O.C, would 'arrange” the voting boxes, they thought that the Govt, candidates would be successful, (14). Confirmation of the fact that the G.O.C. had warned (Nasir off, was y ^0' T f *off was obtained that s5sae day In a message which Nasir's mother addressed to H,M,Consul 0 She^asked why ^er son, who w a true patriot and who was such a friend oi the British* hed veen rej-cted, and asked for our intervention. She was told verbally that the British saw no reason to intervene with the I.Ct. in the matter of elections. H«M.Consul further asked w y, if Nasir was such a friend of the British, he had sheltered the enemies of Britain and of Iran 0 (id'UThe a e o 0 C’s attitude in regard to Nasir’s election for Shiraz gives rise to some speculation* He argued that conditjons were imposed which led to a lessening of ^asir Vestige”Vis election for Shiraz wo^ld (O increaeo the chances p nv t candidates* (h &gt;l lessen chances of disturbances;, ^uch a line of appeasement would agree with the n^o.c’s policy^here to date c Some people say he had accepted bribes from N^s^r to secure his election.

(3)o Elections in Shiraz town ended quietly on Feb, 9th. but voting in some of the country districts of Shiraz has not yet ended# It is stated that the result will be known in a month's time. ( 4 )* On Feb. 6th, some excitement was cuased by the action of the candidates hostile to the Government nominees. One of thetn, PAZARGAD, with the backing of SEYYID NUR ED DIN and probably that of Nasir Qashgai, complained to the Public Prosecutor that the authorities had committed electoral irregularities. Although it is claimed that the Public Prosecutor has nothin^ to do with such matters, the acting P„P. without consulting the Supervisory Committee or the Acting Governor General, ordered a search of the Shiraz town election centre in order to find an alleged second box destined to be substitued for the reaJU-one for counting purposes.- No such box was found 0 SimiJLarlyTatZarghun • the box was illegally opened by the acting Public Prosecutor himself and the votes brought to Shiraz on the grounds that voting had started before due date, in order to favour the Govt, candidates, Voting had indeed, apparently started prematurely, but when the votes were examined none of them were in favour of the Govt., candidates,. On the same day, another voting box was opened by the same party in a village near Shiraz belonging to Muaddil, a Govt., candidate, on the ground that the voters had been obliged by force to vote for Govt, candidates# This charge was also unproven. (b^.Pasargad appears to be closely associated with the Tudeh party which, in Shiraz however, is of no real importance. Its chief towy, membership locally is officials (especially in the Judicial and Education Dept$, schoolboys, and the so-called intelligentia. The action of the Public Prosecutor appears to have been unconstitut ional and calls for investigation. The other anti-Govt. candidates saw in his plans a chance of furthering their own ends. Seyyid Nur ed Did and C~j, have now v/ritten a letter to the A.G.G. in which they declare that never have elections been carried out with greater freedom of vote and freedom from irregularities. It is possible that this testimonialintroducing two more ,, Freedoms ,, may be of use locally if the local authorities decide to carry out their previously declared intention of securing at all costs the election &lt;*f Govt, candidates. On the instructions of H.M.Minister, H.M,Consul has warned both the G.O.C, and the A.G.G, of the dangers of faking the election results, (6), Nasir Khan Qashgai, despite the fact that he was warned a by the G.O.C. that the Iranian Govt,, would not allow him to sit for Shiraz, has not withdrawn. His chief supporter, and perhaps the decisive factor in his decision to continue his candidature, has been his brother Khosrow who, living in Shiraz, is well situated to T! carry on electoral activities. Khosrow has bribed and threatened as much as he was able, and has sent armed horsemen - as a hint at Qashgai power - to all voting centres.2 , Sec p&lt;v (V). But the local authorities do not appear to be perturbed. A-fter all the bo.es are deposited with them for secur.ty ultimately, and the Supervisory Committee, who supervise „he oount- ■ino- la larmelv composed of their nominees. On Feb. 10th, the A. ’-.O. informed nfn,Consul that'of the total number of 2 -^J.n Shiraz tovm. only 98S1 or less than a l^^r. had ^^ered to /ote- although those in the know would have been able ^11 their vote. As far as Shiraz tovm is concerned, the A.O.u. estimatea Seyyid Nur ed Pin had received some 4,500 votes, Rez.i Miknat . Oovt. candidate who enjoys the su PP°Ft of the riashgai and that of Seyyid Nur ed Din) about 4,000 votes this being about eoual to the number cast for Nasir Khan himself, ^he other _ ^ ed Pin cum ^ashjai candidates, namely Urdubadi, Pazargad, Sadvizadeh and Ibn Yusuf are alleged to havepolled between two and three hundred voted each, while the Oovt. candidates are said to have reached about the 8,000 mark. The chief hope ^he Govt, c n- didates is in the country where the peasants- under the influ of the Gendarmerie and of their landlords - are expected (in o - Qashgai areas) to vote for Govt, candidates. (q), por quick v/itted people like the Shirazis, it is sur- prAsinp that the tovm vote was so low. People in general are unbelievably ignorant of electoral procedure; s^me voted because they were told that if they voted in a certain v/ay sales of and tea would be made free and the coupon system abolished, men it is realised that probably only 10&gt; of towndwellers anc ^ country dwellers are literate, such ignorance is understandable. The Value, however, of the present electoral system is open to doubt. Perhaps a two degree electoral system is preferable. (9) As far as the other constituencies are concerned, elections have not yet begun. The G.O.G. has now sent orders to Col.- Himmat, Commander of the Jahrum brigade, to or \, p ' elections: in other words to secure the election of A ,API , the Govt, candidate for Lar. Prom Jahrum there are reports that Hasir Khan is working to secure the election of his brother Malik Mansur. In this area HazaojL, the son of a local doctor, is v/ell entrenched, and without the use of force it would be difficult to secure the election of either of the Govt.’s proposed candidates. ANWAR or ARAB SHAIBANI, or of Malik Mansur. As azaoj. has now sworn allegiance to Qawam, the A.G.G. has £ow tele raphed to his master suggesting that Kazan! he given the Govt, ticket for Jahrum, TRIBAL. (10\ The Mamassani are still showing signs of anxiety lest Govt, forces should be used against them to place the heirs oi Haji Muin ut Tujjar in possession of their l^ds. They also fear attacks eith from the Boir Ahmedi from the North and from the ^ashgai to the South of them, C11 ^ L oh A o ■* v 4 ty among the Qashgai has been Nasir s electoral'campaign^ At the beginning of the Khan sent a message to H.M.Consul through Reza hikmat (,a Govt. A ' , “'candidate) with a view to favouring his chances for election. He made the usual premise to surrender the Germans and to preserve good order. It is obvious that Rasir is not prepared and is probably unable to surrender rifles in any worthwhile quantity - an indispensible term of surrender. In any case, he returned no definite replyto H.M 0 Consul’s request for concrete proposals for transmission to H.M„Embassy 0 (12).On Peb. Sth* G.O.C, informed H.M.Consul that he had received information from the Coastal Column to the effect that QQshn-ai tribesmen were raiding villages in the littoral which had expressed loyalty to Govt, during his recent visit. He claimed that he had o-iven Col* Ladsetan, Commanding the Column, orders to pursue the raiders, and promised him more troops if necessary.3. TRIBAL DISARMAMENT. (13) . On Pet. 8th. the O.C.C., stuns Into action the openly expressed disapproval hy Tehran 0 f. hi s a ppeasement policy towards the Qashgal, and also hy the realisation th »t he was -'“•tting nowhere with it, and indeed that his disapproval ° f t«asir's candidature was being openly flouted, informed ! that he was p;oinP’ to Tehran to discuss with the competent authorities ther? his plans for disarming the turbulent tribe. He have H.M.Consul a brief outline of his plans, and Save the impression that he had given insufficient thought to the problem.. In particular, there seems to have “been no political r ation for his military operations, C.O.C, claimed he w. s gettinp; no support from Tehran, and hinted that if the a ala not support his present plans, he v/ould resign. WHEAT . (14) .On Feb. 5th. Lt.Col. Ataullah paid his long expected visit to Shiraz. After considerable discussions between the G.O.C., the Head of the Food Dept., and H.M,Consul, the follow ing agreement was reached: (a). 500 tons of wheat were to be sent at once Xehran n from stores outside the town. Col. Ataullah promised transport to bring this wheat into Shiraz* as Persian Army Transport could not be sent on to the of -rain If, when the 500 tons had been despatched, the stock of ^rain in Shiraz fell below 2,000 tons. Col. Ataullah would again visit Shiraz to investigate the position. , . . ir . hie , (b).

T . . not to send wheat to Tehran, and not to mix barley with the who t. h m Consul met a deputation from the Union in the Governorate, and‘po?nted out that their attitude Implied a lack in their duty to their country of whose independence and unity jealous, and that the proposed measures were essential to the economy of the country. (It appears that they were frightened of popular uproar if barley bread were introduced, for the public v/ould blame them for their shortcomings., H.M.Consul also inform ed them that he expected them to enter into fresh whe_at contracts with Major Pottomley, otherwise the percentage of barley would have to be increased, and that they would he held responsible for the change. (16) . This attitude rather shook the landlords who, next day, sent a deputation to declare solemnly that they accepted the two measures. SECURITY.

(6&gt;# No important developments have occurred in the incident .*&gt; which Covt. forces suffered a sharp (though minor; reverse iic?a.r Kazerun. Nor is any further reliable information obtain able. There seems no doubt, however, that the Govt, forces were badly led, suffered a sharper check than originally admitted by the G.O,C, . and that the robbers anri their accomplices have not been punished. There is no evidence that Farsimadan Qashgai helped the robbers, but it seems likely that they did. Khosrow Qashgai sent messages to the tribe in question not to aid the robbers but to assist Govt, forces. They are unlikely now to aid cither party* (?'. Meanwhile the news of the incident has spread far and wide in an exaggerated form and Govt, prestige has suffered. The incident took place in mountainous country and it would be difficult, even for good forces, to track down and kill the robbers and thus offset the effects of the incident. (8&gt;, Another disturbing incident occurred on 24th. Feb. v/hen Bulvardi Qashgai robbers are stated by the Head of the Gendarmerie, to have set an ambush between Shahpur and Kazerun to attack the A.G.G. on his return from Mamassani. Fortunately the'A,G,G, did not return until the 25th, and so escaped. The tribesmen, it is stated, drove off a flock of sheep, but when persued by Govt, forces, fled without loss, leaving the sheep, Both the AiG.G. and the Commander of the 6th, Division believe this was an attempt on the A.G,G,$s life. TRIBAL. (9\The outstanding feature is the decision of the Mamassani not to support the O.awam and the Govt, candidates but to vote for Naeir Qashgai and Co. This is a definite break with Manass- ani tradition, and is the result of Govt, neglect to encourage these people to continue their previous policy of friendship to Govt, by (a&gt; settling the land claims, and (b) assuring them of protection against their hereditary enemies the Qashgais and the B.Ajs. The loss of the friendship of, the Mamassani is a great blow to Govt., prestige for it affords proof that this tribe at least consider that the Govt, is so weak that it is more important to placate the enemies of the Govt, than the Govt, itself. Furthermore, the defection renders the task of tribal disarmament still more difficult as it deprives the Govt, of the possibility of forming a pro-Govt, bloc composed of Mamassani, Dushmanziari and other elements which would have helped in the disarmament programme. (10). For some time past, th^ue has been talk of mutual aid pacts between the B.A’s and the Qashgai, and it now seems certain that the Mamaseani have joined the block. The only tribe which remains aloof Is the Khamseh Arab and the nomadic elements of 3his semi-sedentary tribe may soon find it expedient to join the majority. Although these tribes are now banded together, it would seem' improbable that.they would for the moment unite to attack Govt, or do anything much more aggressive than raiding or looting. All tribal alliances are inherently unstable and since the Mamassani are sedentary Lurs and the Qashgai nom adic Turks, the union cannot be very stable. It is possible, however, that unless they can he pacified the Mamassani would assist the other tribes to resist disarmament,.

He arrived too late to do anything more than supervise the counting, ( 4 &gt;, go far the Oashgai have shown no signs of creating a disturbance - possibly due to the absence of the hot-headed Khosrow in Tehran. Both Nasir and his mother now realise that his election is highly improbable, and although they are both angry, it seems unlikely they will create disorder. (5). In the Lar constituency, voting has taken place in all the outlying districts, but has been suspended in Lar town owing to dissensions in the Supervisory Council, A Govt, super visor will be sent to Lar and it is expected that voting will be resumed on his arrival. Meanwhile, the Govt, candidate, Azadi, is stated to be leading with a very small majority, despite the aid given to his Sunni opponent Faramarzi, by the Sunni cornmunit-ics of Bastah and Lingeh, by the ;*ashgai and the Gendarmerie, and by Hishmat ul Mamelik (one of the hard-boiled Hikmats who like £0 play with the Qashgai), TRIBAL . (6),On 8th. March a British Officer visited Nasir Khart at Firuzabad and found him in a dangerously exalted frame of mind. Nasir sees himself as the head of a tribal bloc composed of all the tribes of Pars, and in that capacity considers his strength as greater than that of Govt,. Realising he will probably not be elected, be is now casting himself for the part of Governor General of Ears. ( 7 ^. There seems no doubt but that a tribal bloc has now been formed to resist disarmament, but it seems improbable that the tribes could unite to attack the Govt, although looting and robbing will undoubtedly continue, especially during the migration. (8). Proof of.the existence of agreement between the tribes was forthcoming on 14thnst. when Ahmed Khan Kashguli (a prominent pro-British Kalantar) came to consult F.M’s Consul at the request of Nasir Khan over a telegram received from Abdullah n Zarghaunpur, In this telegram, A.K.Z. stated that the B&amp;hnai ( Taibi and Dushmanziafci « vi rv A TICE!

(g'i jt is possible that H.M.Consul’s advice may be taken, for there is an Increasing desire among the tribes to stand\ve?l with the British. This is based following considerations; (a^ we are winning the war; r ® 3dd sooner or later the Iranian Govt, will seek to disarm them, (o'! they desirt our help to prevent * hedr . tei ! lg oast to the inefficient and corrupt tribal adninistratio t ib ^ At -nresent local Govt, power seems to he inferior to tower! but’relative security is being enforced by ’’asir in the hope of finding a way (other than bloodshed^ out of the present deadlock.

Meanwhile reports have been received of the fail ure of crops in S.E. Pars where crops are dependent on rainfall. In consultation with Colonel Hlmmat, Commander of the Jahrum Brigade, Majqr Bottomley (Cereals Officer) has arranged to send 100 tons of barley to Bar, 30 tons to Jahrum, and Probably 30 tons to Bastah to last for the next 100 days. In that time fuller knowledge of the exact needs for food and seed until the 194b harvest, can be ascertained. (12^. Owing to the drought, the southern sections of the Oashgal are finding difficulty with their pasturage. Iiaslr Khan states that the tribe must migrate earlier this year. (13^Meanwhile, the rain of the 15th. inst has done much to allay fears that the crops in the whole of Pars would be lost. PUBLIC HEALTH. (14), Typhus and typhoid are prevalent. British Consulate,.

During most of the month the ^-.r.C. has been away fVnm Shiraz firstly in the disarmament campaign against the Batoai and Tam and for the last week of the month in Isfahan. ( 2 ) On 26th. March. Colonel Bahrami, Commander of the 6th Shiraz&gt; Division, was recalled to Tehran and Colonel Himmat, formerly commanding the brigade at Jahrum ^ assumed command. This officer envoys a good reputation for /•u r .yipatv and bravery, and v/as formerly in the-S.F.K. it seemb certain that he accepted his present appointment with reluctance firstly because he has had no staff experience; secondly, he fears that his previous British connection may make him llabl trauack for being too pro-British; and finally because he is aware that neither the Persian Government nor the G.C.C.have any plan or pol^oy for dealing with the tribes. (S'. On March 25th. the n.o.c. telegraphed to Tehran effer- ing his resignation. He explained his action to -^sul by saying -as he had done on previous occasions - that he had no directive from Tehran, and that he received no support. He cited two cases in connection with the recent campaign. He had asked that a certain quantity of tea and sugar should be distributed among the tribes in question, but had been refused. Ha had also suggested the formation of a small force of -endam- erie recruited locally among the disarmed tribes, but baa curtly been informed, that no money could be found for the purpose. (4\ But there are probably other reasons. It seems almost aertaln that he has been charged and. reproved by the &amp;h ®b for letting it be known that the Shah personally had refused toja^ow Nasir Khan to be a deputy for Shiraz. Actually it seems P^o®“ able that Khosrow Khan learnt of the Shah s ing Tehran. Another factor for the G.O.C s resignation migh have been the Ohange of Govt, and especially the departure of Rlazi from the post of Chief of Staff, following the appointment ©f Zand instead of Ahmedi as Minister of far. (5\ By the end of the month, Tehran had not decided whether to accept the G.O.G’s resignation or not. (6'. On 27th. inst. a group of Gendarmerie left their barracks and set off to come to this Consulate to take Bast here in protest against the insufficiency of their pay. They were, however, headed off by the Commandant before they had time to ruin tne garden. ELECTIONS.

(B\ 7 /ithout the hackinp; of the Crovt. , which went even- to the extent of changing the I'i amass an i 'box, there is no doubt ^ that most of the (lovt. candidates would have failed to secure j election. On the other hand, Nasir Khan undoubtedly used fo^^e to intimidate voters, and furnished other people with mon^-y to buy v^tes. Similarly, Seyyid Nur ed Kin successfully exploited the ambitions of at least two wealthy merchants to line his own pockets under pretext of securing their election* In general, the election was a very unsavoury affair, though prebably nc worse than elsewhere in Iran, keza Kikmat, Y/ell endowed with the cunning of his family, succeeded in obtaining the support of both the O-ovt. and iashgai. The success of Imam Jumaa is the cause of great resentment, as he is widely disliked. Probably as a proof of public displeasure, his house on the outskirts of Shiraz was recently burgled, and the disappearance of his treasured dinner jacket is taken as a great joke in Shiraz. The Imam Jumaa. (irreverntly referred to as Imam. Yekshambeh'' informed I J .1*.

A British officer who was -with Nasir report ed that on receipt of this message, Nasir Blew into a violent temper and*sent a reply g~omising his collaboration.

It was obvious that Nasir was in a dangerously exalted mood.

NASIR KHAN’S projected visit to Shiraz duly took place on the 1st May. Still sore over being refused permission to stand for Parliament, Nasir Khan had from the beginning refused to call on the Acting Governor-General, whom he held (wrongly) responsible for Government opposition. Accoi dmgly, when he came to Shiraz it was agreed that he should first call on the general omcei commanding and “ accidentally ” find there the Governor. Taking this as a call on him Nasir agreed to “ return ” the call and did so by going to tea at the Governorate that day. 2. After his call on the general officer commanding, Nasir called on Mis Majesty’s consul. During a call which lasted two hours he stressed his leadiness to comply with our wishes and made no demands (even connected with elections) on us. Notably he stated that he was determined to prove his friendship for us by preserving good order in Ears. In addition, he asked that British officers should frequent the tribe. Throughout the interview he expressed complete distrust of the Persian Government. 3. Nasir Khan was entertained to lunch by the general officer commanding, senior Persians and British officials being present. The same people were also invited to the tea party given by the Acting Governor-General. On the morning of the 2nd May Nasir Khan returned to his tribal quarters, having spent the night with the general officer commanding. 4. The local authorities having received on the 3rd May news that the Shah would arrive in Ears on the 7th May, the general officer commanding wished to return Nasir’s call at once. Accordingly the general officer commanding, Acting Governor-General and His Majesty’s consul set out on the 4th May for Nasir’s camp near Baiza. The general officer commanding naturally greatly desired Nasir to call on the Shah at Persepolis, and Nasir, though not admitting it, betrayed his desire to go, but only provided that His Majesty’s Government would guarantee his immunity from arrest. The general officer commanding tried to induce His Majesty’s consul to give the necessary guarantee, offering to give a written guarantee to His Majesty’s consul that no action would be taken against Nasir. But His Majesty’s consul felt unable to accede to this request without prior reference to the embassy—a course which time rendered impossible. 5. Nasir and his fellow khans still entertain the utmost distrust of the Government, and they feared that the Shah’s visit to Ears immediately after Nasir’s own visit to Shiraz indicated some danger for him. At the request of His Majesty’s consul, however, Nasir’s two brothers, Mohammed Hussein and Khosrow. went to Persepolis to greet the Shah there and subsequently entertained him to dinner in Shiraz. 6. It is possible that the Shah, the general officer commanding and others are indignant that Nasir Khan did not come to greet him, and resent the fact that he would have come on a British guarantee which was not forthcoming. 7. During the visit to the Qashqai the general officer commanding discussed with Nasir Khan the question of the elections at the remaining three Shiraz seats, namely, Abadeh, Jahrum and Firuzabad. Nasir took the line with him (and with His Majesty’s consul, who was subsequently dragged in) that he should have three Qashqai candidates—himself. Malik Mansur and Purreza—(to whom he had given his word) as all the other Deputies of Ears (except Reza Hikmat) were Qawam’s men. In conversation with His Majesty’s consul Nasir said that he must have all three seats or none at all, adding that he did not mind being unrepresented. His Majesty’s consul deprecated the proposal that there should be no Qashqai representatives in the Majlis, whereupon Nasir said tentatively that he would agree to two candidates, himself for Abadeh and Purreza for [54—8] F.t. ti{*T. INDIA CFF!GB |Ctar&gt;*' tu 0 fUo / COFiruzabad. If he were elected, Nasir said he would go to Tehran irom time to time, but would spend most of his time with the tribe. It was J His Maiesty’s consul's business to refuse or accept this oner. i K 8. The general political atmosphere in Fars has been greatly \™P\ oved Nasir’s visit to Shiraz and by the voluntary surrender (on the 4th May) ot tne Deputy, Naubakht, who has been harboured by the Qashqai for many i , Some progress has been made towards re-establishing confidence e wee tribe and the Government. Further confidence has been established y e ‘ L that Qashqai tribesmen, for the first time for several years, have la e ) visi the town in numbers to buy and sell, and also by the fact that ^ e spring ‘migration has been remarkably free from incident. Although Nasir s pi onus to comply with our wishes must be heavily discounted, it is certain that he nas a certain respect for our wishes. It therefore seems probable that Britis i interests are less in danger of damage at the hands of the Qashqai than at any time recently. Shah's Visit. 9. On the 3rd May the senior Persian officials here received telegrams announcing the intention of the Shah to leave Tehran for Fars on the 6th May, spending only one night en route. At this news officialdom in Shiraz pamcke . Meetings were held to discuss what was to be done to entertain the Shah and to furbish up the city to provide a fitting spectacle for his august eyes^ I hen it was discovered that the municipality had no funds to repair the pot-holes in the main streets and to sprinkle water on them. The water-men were on strike because they had had no wages for two months and there was no prospect ot getting a loan from the bank as the municipality had already borrowed heavily from it. However, all was eventually arranged after a style (Persian) after lengthy and heated discussions. . 10. On the evening of the 7th May the Shah, accompanied by the Minister of Court, M. Ala, and the Minister of the Interior, M. Hajhir, duly arrived at Persepolis and spent the night there. In the moonlight, His Majesty walked in the ruins of Persepolis for two hours, doubtless drawing inspiration from the illustrious dead. The next morning His Majesty’s consul, at the request of the general officer commanding, went to Persepolis to be presented to the Shah. While waiting, His Majesty’s consul was questioned by M. Hajhir and Shoku ul Mulk as to the remedies for the present tribal situation. His Majesty’s consul replied that he understood that His Majesty’s embassy had already made certain proposals in that regard to the Persian Government. Basically the situation was that the tribes entertained a deep-seated distrust of the Government, which was partly justified by the events of the past. The essential problem was to wean the tribes from their present nomadic life and settle them down as agriculturists, and to do this a new administrative machinery should be devised which would be honest and efficient and which would inspire confidence. 11. That evening the Shah came into Shiraz and appeared to receive an enthusiastic welcome from the population. From observations made during the course of the last week there appears to be no doubt that the enthusiasm was genuine, though it is hard to say whether it is due to the person of the present Shah or to the general idea of monarchy—but it is probably the latter. 12. In the interview given to His Majesty’s consul the next morning the Shah made several platitudinous speeches in which he emphasised the need of Anglo-Persian friendship, and stated that he hoped that our contacts—both commercial and cultural—would be multiplied after the war. He also spoke of the need—if Persia is to be a democratic country—of the law being applied strictly to rich and poor alike. Accordingly, the possession of arms should be restricted to Government forces, who alone are the instrument of the nation (emphasis on this word) to secure internal security and to defend the integrity and honour of the country against aggression. Thus the possession of arms by the tribes was an offence against democracy, as the khans could not be tried by the courts as could a statesman who had abused the nation’s confidence in him. On the other hand, speaking of the tribes, he admitted that they had been treated harshly and unjustly in the past, and said that their lot should be improved. In this connexion both the Shah and members of his suite in conversation with the young Qashqai khans, Mohammed Hussein and Khosrow, expressed sympathy with the tribes and tried to gain their friendship. In particular, he said that as King he had many enemies and therefore needed friends and hoped to find those friends among the tribes.3 13. Sightseeing, parties, shooting, &amp;c., occupied most of the Shah s fi^ie in Shiraz, for which he has evidently formed a liking, for he has pro onged his stay here. In one visit he saw one of the Shiraz slums. Entering people s houses without ceremony he spoke to the people. On a subsequent occasion he revealec his emotion on discovering the wretched living conditions of his subjects. 14. There have been two or three hints that the Shah and his entouiage are considering the present system of appointing officials as Governors oi ‘important centres and of appointing instead persons of family and estate, endowing them with wider powers. Such a step might, of course, lead to increasing the power of the Shah, but if the persons were suitable it should result in the elimination of much of the officialdom which at present clogs the wheels of administration. 15. Until the evening of the 12th May no British officials or officers were invited to any of the functions which took place in honour of the Shah nor were any contacts established between the suite and this consulate. This was stiangel) at variance with the normal state of affairs here and occasioned some comment in British circles. On the 12th May, however, Messrs. Johnson and Quilliam of the Imperial Bank played tennis against the Shah, partnered by Qawami, a Persian employee of the A.I.O.C. That evening the two military officers were asked to the manoeuvres to take place the next morning, and M. Ala sought an interview with His Majesty’s consul. It is possible, therefore, that this seeming neglect was due partly to preoccupation of the Persians with their own affairs ami partly to the idea of the local officials that the presence of foreigners would not be welcome to the Shah. 16. When His Majesty’s consul called on M. Ala the latter was lull oi the press attacks (especially those in Pa’ad) on the Shah. He was clearly hostile to Seyed Zia and described him as an aspiring dictator with reactionary tendencies. The Seycd’s policy, he considered, ran counter to the benevolent intentions of the Shah to lead his country towards democracy. M. Ala also betrayed anxiety over reports he had heard from Cairo and other places to the effect that the Shah had fallen into the power of the Russians over the offer of military material. He assured me that this was not the c&amp;se and that His Majesty had rejected the Russian offer on account of the conditions attached thereto (i.e., the formation of mixed units). 17. At the end of the interview His Majesty’s consul pointed out to M. Ala that since the Shah’s arrival something approaching ostracism of British officials here had been observed. The Minister replied that such an idea w T as far from His Majesty’s intention and apologised. Invitations for the remaining functions were sent on the morning of the 15th and the Minister returned His Majesty s consul’s call. 18. On the evening of the 13th May His Majesty’s consul called on M. Hajhir, Minister of the Interior, at his request. He seemed to have decided that a tribal settlement scheme, as advocated by His Majesty’s embassy, was necessary and feasible. He also said that he thought Nasir should be elected for Abadeh and Malik Mansur for Firuzabad on condition that the latter immediately resigned in favour of, perhaps, Rezavi. J A. J.

It is a p-eat pity that the opportunity was not taken to push him in for Abadeh while he was still amenablec Perhaps however the new Governor General will be able to induce Nasir to stand. 9. The reported renting of the Doshnanziari lands to Nasir Khan has produced a letter of protest addressed to the Consulate by the leading Doshmanziari Khans. Dr Hikmat, who claims to Tp son in law of the absenieee landlord Huhsein DarHerr, stated that he no longer acted as agent for the lands in guestion and that the culprit, if culprit there was, was Dadgerr’s son Kerim who lived in .Tehran and was the lessor of Victory u ouse t^ere. 9A- Opportunity was taken to sound Hishm&amp;t ul Mamalek Hikmat ( Dr Hikmat’ s cousin ) concerning a report that he was about to rent lands to the Kashguli 0 Hishmat ul i'amalek has lands at Khisht, in the Shabankareh area and at Saadabad and stated, that* he had been considering: # &gt;consi’derinj; su'j-lettin., the fortier*.

But the possibility of violent reactions to Nasir’s penetration into other than ^ashpai areas appears to be too real to be ignored,, 11o The future of Uasir Khan seems, at the moment. to be very nncertnin so far as his dreams of autonomy for the south, if he has any, are concerned. Whichever way he turns senna likely to lead to his undoing or at least to debar him from realizing the ai litions with which he is credited* If he plays pretti r and td. es a seat in the Majlis any ideas he may h&gt;ve on his ^ersonal ascendancy in Pars will scarcely resist the pressure to which they will be subjected in’ public 0 If he determines to remain with ohe tribes his position is likely to be und ^mined by :nternal dissensions including a possible, and reported imminent, breach v/ith his two brothers in Tehran.

The leading merchant to whom reference was made in last month's report has gone'over the brink of bankruptcy but many hands are outstretched to stop him from crashing. Ad committee has been formed to examine his affairs and as his books are apparently in very bad order it will taken another fortnight to sort things out. The only solution of the problem appears to be to pay outstanding creditors in ki id and not cash and when this is eventually adopted great care will no doubt be taken to see that goods merely go from one godown to another and are not permitted to appear on the open market.

Daily purchases, from old and new harvest, were averaging fifteen tons of wheat and ten tons of barley a day, Preparations are now in hand for the purchase of the new harvest and contracts are being drawn up and signed ^©r most of the ^ars area, except the Shiraz plain where grain is collected directly from individual landowners. In the Pass and Darah areas purchases are already being made, a beginning has been made at Kazerun and barley from this year’s crop is coaming in from the Marvdasht plain* Purchases are however being hampered by lack of cash due to the failure of the Tehran authorities to remit money to/the Kharbar here. 21. Captain Budden, grain officer, thinks that prospects are good for the coming year.. Only one thing is causing him concerr and that is the regulation for the insertion in contracts of a clause stipulating that if impurities amount to more than five percent they shall be reckoned at double their quantity for the purpose of price reduction P Captain Budden points out that the normal proportion of impurities is eight percent, owing to the way the grain i^ threshed, and that it is Impractical to expect contractors to produce grain with a smaller percentage, all grain is cleand by the silo at the cost of the bakers and it is just as easy to clean grain with eight percent impurity as with five the Government would not lose by raising the minimum to eight percent and he has written to Tehran suggesting this course, Keanwhile the contractors are perturbed and the effect of the clause has been to deter people from taking on contracts.

Chenghiz Khan Qashqai after returning to his father’s house under safe conduct again took to the hills this time east of Shiraz and is stated to have reached Khajieh between Kavar and Firuzabad. Khosrow Qashqai Governor of Firuzabad is reported to have been given 20 rifles and 1,000 rounds of ammunition in order to round up Chenghiz. This report is reliable although unconfirmed. The explanation of the Governor-General’s action in giving Khosrow arms is probably to be found in Naser Qashaqi’s charges that Chenghiz was being supported officially• Notice has been sent to Ali Khan (his father) that if Chenghiz is found outside the town of Shiraz he is liable to be shot or captured. 9. Naser Khan has communicated to the Governor-G e neral the results of the meeting at Kuhruyeh referred to in paragraph 10 of Diary No. 15. The letter, the original of which was sent to the Consulate by the Governor-General, referred very vaguely to maintaining friendly and good relations with the Tehran Government, looked forv/ard to a bright future in Fars under the Gove rnor-Gene ral and expressed th© desire to conform to the views oj. ohe friencl and ally (by which it was presumed Britain was intended) and referred to the protection of their independence (presumably a tilt at the Russians). 10. The letter haughtily referred to the Governor-General s failure to comply with Naser 1 s request that he should be present at the meeting but gave no explanation of their ignoring the Governor Generals suggestion with regard to going to Abadeh and of their meeting without him. 11. It appears that Naser Qashaqi had wanted Abdullah Khan to be present' but the others objected. Firuz Mirza said that if Abdallah Zarghampur went he would merely become swollen headed and that the results obtained from meetings of Persians was in inverse ratio to the numbers assembled. 12. Firuz Mirza was disappointed at not being able to present himself. He obviously wishes to gather all the strings of Fars into his own hands and to strengthen the authority of the Governor—General but whether for his own or for the purposes of the central Government is not yet clear. He clearly has no love for the Shah whom he regards as a schoolboy intriguer and little confidence in the weak Governments that Tekran produces. (SS2^&amp;-C&gt; &amp; '#y*MWtt»fQtrsoO %rtt ♦if»w lb* The other point of interest in connexion with the Kuhruyeh meeting is the presence *ii#fe of ^am ul MuXk; Qavam put in a jriei and very inglorious appearAnc^ *in. Fawc^ as Governor—General before abandoning his post and returning to the capital. Ke has virtually no following in Pars or property in Shiraz although he is intriguing ior lands in the provinde. Capacity for intrigue is apparently one ol his stronger points. He seems to have entirely thrown over any responsibility for the Arab Khamseh tribes and in any case recent reports on these tribes show them to oe of ''negligible importance, neither affluent nor influential but deeply sunk in bestial poverty and more than bestial . ignorance 1 '. ^avam’s only merit, it is perhaps a considerable one in this country, is that he has been and still is a friend of the British. -f situation has arisen in connexion with the Boir Ahmedi who under the present distribution of Governorates fall administratively under both Shiraz and Ahwaz. ’tVhat set the match to the present train of powder is not clear in Shiraz. It has oeen suggested that Khosrow Zarghampur,and Ali and Vali.Izzadpanah soagea an attack on Abdullah Khan Zarghanpur in order to squeeze arms and ammunition out of Humayuni the military commander at Ahwaz. Prom other evidence on hand at the time of compilation of this diary it seems that Humayuni himself - a f ll 5 erately Provoked 'the Khosrow faction to attack Abdullah ^ ias ^ een suggested that the Shah and the Chief of 0 ? afI . are flighted at the prospect of trouble among the Boir /dimedi. The former is reported to be extremely suspicious of the hunruyeh meeting^(see paragraph 9 above) and consequently to welcome the possibility of the tribes weakening themselves bv killing off each other. * lo. Unfortunately the presence of the Qashqai in the background as supporters oi Abdullah Zarghampur adds a more sinister note to the proceedings. At the time of writing Abdullah Zarghampur has appealed to Naser Qashqai for assistance and Malek Mansur 's t &gt;ashqai is collecting horsemen to help him. On the other side Humayuni is apparently supplying the Khosrow faction with arms and ammunition. 16. Opinion in Ghiraz is agreed that if the Qashqai join in ohe iesult will oe. serious so all sorts of persons including aaba Khan Dushmanziari, Ahmad Khan Kashkuli and Khosrow Qashqai are being pressed in to service by the Governor-General as peacemakers. 17. The attitude of the Governor-General is that Humayuni.is stirring up the hornets’ nest but it is the province of Pars that will be stung. 18. ^ Firuz Mirza argues that if it was decided to risk a clash with the Qashqai he should have been consulted beforehand and a concerted policy formed and adequate troops assembled. The present troops in Fars are quite incapable of dealing with the ^asi-qais • According to the Governor—General only one person stands to gain out of the whole proceeding and that is Naser Khan. Whatever support the Government may give to the Khosrow ^arghampur faction the latter can scarcely hope to resist the -5^1. Therefore the prestige of Naser will be enhanced either as the victorious ally or the successful mediator. Khosrow Khaan ^ashqai passing cock-a-whoop through Shiraz on his way from Firuzabad to see Naser said on August 30 that the chances of peace were 9Qm 19. j?iruz Mirza would like to see Behbehan restored to the province of Pars so that Abdullah Zarghampur could no longer enjoy the position, dear to the oriental mind, of his being able to play one authority off against another - in the present^case Shiraz against Ahwaz for v/hile Abdullah Zarghampur is in Tal-e Khosrovi he is nominally under Pars but all contact with him is through Behbehan which is under Ahwaz. Behbehan is nearer Ahwaz out its reincorporation in Pars would mean bringing the Shiraz- -Fehlian// 27 . - Fehlian - Behbehan road in to use y/hich would be of immense interest from the point of view of control of the tribes and future pacification and disarmament. 20— The proposal has however apparently been turned down in To.^ran. Firuz Mirza of course works under the constant disadvan tage, of which he is fully aware, of being a descendant of the former dynasty and therefore subject in all his acts to intense suspicion on the part of the Shah. He goes so far as to say that so far as the Shah is concerned he might be better advised to recommend the exact opposite of any proposal he wishes to see adopted. 21. Khosrow Qashqai announced on August 30 that Naser was being given charge of security among the Qashqai, that is made Rais-e Intezamat, with pay from Government funds for one hundred and twenty men. This has not yet been confirmed from the Governor- General but is consistent with what is known of his intentions. Firuz Mirza thinks that as Abdullah Zarghampur is a strong man a settlement of his problem should be made on lines of official recognition. Meanwhile Khosrow Qashqai was cool enough toyarn the Consulate that we should probably receive complaints of victimization by the Qashqai. ELECTIONS 22. Pur Reza, formerly Qashqai agent in Tehran and a supporter of Seyyid Zia ud Din Tabatabai has been elected for the Majles from Firuzabad. 23. Agha Arifi who for a short time was Governor of Abadeh volunteered the information that the people there would, if they could, elect Omid Salar the local candidate Col. Amanpur who was sent to Abadeh to quell the anti-Bahai demonstrations there, says on the other hand that Mohammed Hussein Qashqui will be elected. Khosrow Qashqai left no doubt that the Qashqai were determined to secure the election of their man. Meanwhile it has been reported that Naser Khan has sold 900 Kilos of seed wheat supplied to him from the Kharbar for the tribes to pay for the election expenses at Abadeh. 24. The prospect of another local election arises from the death in Tehran of Javad Azadi the member for Laristan. SHIRAZ TOWN 25. Shiraz in common with other towns in Persia is suffering from a shortage of water* Residents claim that the winters in Pars are getting progressively milder with less snow and rain fall. Last winter was in any case a particularly dry one and Shiraz, again in common with other Persian towns, has spread considerably particularly in gardens and villas at the top end of the town which is the end at which the present water supply enters. The position is therefore that the demand for water has increased while the supply has if anything diminished. 26. The valley in which Shiraz lies slopes away from the town; it is not without water but existing springs and wells are in the lower part of the valley and therefore call for pumps and piping before they can be utilised for the town. Imported pumps and piping may take years to arrive in Shiraz while the need for water is immediate./ 34 . 27. The Governor-General is therefore considering a scheme proposed by Professor Windsor, Irrigation Adviser to the Persian Government, to bring water from the neighbourhood of Ardekan eighty kilometres to Shiraz. The P lai J 18 ' to ® rect at Shesh Pir and Tang Khalar and store the winter and 8 P r f n S floods water for use in Shiraz in summer. It is not P r ° p °® ed /^ fere with the present flow of the spring at Shesh Fir (estimated at 150 sangs), that will remain for the local villagers and for local cultivation, but to use only the.water stored in the reservoirs behind the dams. It is estimated that these^ reservoirs will produce a constant flow of three hundred sangs (Tehran measure) a sang being the cubic capacity of a brick. 28. The advantage of this project is tbfit it can be completed with out using any imported materials whatsoever, that the total construction will only occupy twenty months, Wt it emable the whole Shiraz valley to be cultivated should this be a paying proposition. Minor advantages would be the creation of local employment, the moral effect on the population and the possibility of growing sufficient cotton for the needs of local mills instead of as at present importing cotton from Tehran *nd Egypt. 29. The snag is the cost which is estimated at seven million tomans. Of this sum one million is available from a former gift of the Shah which Dr. Millspaugh has apparently agreed to release. Professor Windsor has promised two and a half million tomans from his irrigation credits, two million four hundred thousand tomans are to be subscribed by sixty of the leading local residents and the balance of one million one hundred thousand tomans is to be offered for public subscription. 30. A company is to be formed with the support, among otheis, of Muaddle, one of the local deputies and another deputy. Ali Mohammed Dehqan is apparently to canvas for shareholders in Tehran. If the company is registered and succeeas in raising the necessary cash it will extend its activities to the rest of Pars starting with the Persepolis valley where water formerly dammed now runs to waste. PARS PROVINCE 31. On August 14 last an A.I.O.C. tanker on the Pir-e ^an pass of the Bushire road was shot up and the driver s mate killed. The aggressors have not been identified and it is suggested that the real object of attack was a lorry containing sugar which had dropped back a *place in the convoy. The connivance of the Gendarmerie is suggested. GRAIN 32. On September silo stocks amounted to 4,4Cu tons of wheat and 5,150 tons of barley. In addition there are 1,800 tons of wheat and 850 tons of barley in outlying anbars awaiting trans port. Purchases are generally satisfactory and have now risen to 150-200 tons daily, the Kharbar Mervdasht doing particularly well with an average of seventy tons daily and a total of ^,,000 tons purchased to date. The bulk of the cereals is now being collected from the Khaarak and Mervdasht areas. It is anticipated that Shahrivar will produce about 5,000 tons in purchases. 33. Tribal dissension in the Ardekan district is hindering transport of cereals and robber bands are a great menace to animal transport in the Beiza and Abaj area.WPfli 34. There are at present only 65 I.G. Pool trucks ^gjigap;ed in cereals collection, requirements being one ondred. As a result grain is accumulating in temporary stores which must be emptied before winter sets in. British Consulate, Shiraz. 2 September 1944. h.G. Jakins. jWgEfougoiForeign Office, 4 copies; H.M.

The sensation ment of the Governor first heard the news his wife’s relatives mourning, and his plane was sent to it bock to Tehran owing to the tribal the mullahs in town, and the only political been instigated by the Governor-General himselfc 2. One is therefore left to deduce that General Firuz post poned his departure for Tehran in order to i) give himself time to consider all the implications of his accepting the Ministry Of War and ii) to see wheth/er the Government lasted the week out* The aeroplane returned on. September 11 when the Governor General left for Tehran* 3. General Firuz is a survivor of the former Qajar dynasty and is accejjted as possibly the most capable remaining member of the family 0 He was brought up at the Imperial Court of St. Peters burg, saw his crack Russian regiment go red and toured Europe with Ahmed Shah. He speaks fluent Russian and French and reads Harold Nicholson on Curzcn and Algernon Cecil on Metternich. T n short he has a background* Hu is honest, intelligent, energetic and has ideas. G. He is fully aware of the complete incapacity of the Persf'an Arn# in the provinces - or at least in this province- and anxious to rt*forn a system which allows soldiers in Pars to go barefoot and bareseflted while thu number of high-ranking officers mounts in Tehran where they chiefly occupy themselves xh with intrigue. He alttO sees no hope in the present type of younger officer. 5. As the Shah's idea of a Minister of War is that he should be a r&amp;yixtK complete nonentity who wial leave the Shah to do exactly as he pleases with the Army it is clear that if General Firuz accepts the.Ministry of War the stage is set for a clash of personalities * 6 . General Firuz’s opinion of the Shah is even lower tfehn that now generally current and he would not to human if he did not recalx-his own origins. The Shah on the other hand can scarce ly forget that Firuz is a Qajar or that his own father started his political career precisely as Minister cf ^ar. 7. General Firuz said before he left that unless he could serve the country as a whole more usefully by accepting the post pf Minister of War he would prefer to stay in Fars. He has a per sonal interest in this province, is very well liked here and in the two months of his stay had begun to make good progress. He has no confidence in +be present Frime Minister and would not be unwilling to fill the office of Premier himself. If therefore Firuz accepts the Ministry of War it will probably be because by becoming a Minister he will be better placer, to form in cue course a Ministry of his own. 8 , Whi n e General Firuz was still in fhiraz Nemazi and the in the Majles wired*to him urging him not other Shiraz deputies to become Minister of War* After his departure for Tehran the local leading merchants, landowners, newspaper editors and repres entatives of other .classes wireri the Prime Minister, the President of the Majles, the fractions'in the Majles and the newspaper ed itors of Tehran urging that Firuz should return to Rars/ The local press is very favourable to th Governor General and critical of ftfifia. #Ui- E-3*.

Ali Khan (Chenghiz’s father) had called at the Consulate and asked what he should do about his son 0 He/advised to bring /./as/ Chenghiz Jack to Shiraz and keep him there. Ali Khan also appealed for aexistence as an old friend of the British who had fallen on evil days throug 1 the non-payment of his monthly allowance. It is well! known in Shiraz thatthis family is reduced to serious sraits and has been settling its carpets c Appeals to Ml/ Murray, on behalf of Ali Khan, have produced the reply zhat nothing can be done without instructions from Tehran while enquiries of the Governor General disclosed that the case was on the list of matters to be discussed in the capital. 21. Fighting among the Boir nhmedi seems to have halted c Sult- ani, the de^puty for Behb^han, came down from Tehran at the Governor General’s rquest but &amp;hile ostensibly working for peace he is re ported. to have secretly hajtK encouraged the ' party' opposed to Ab dullah Khan Zarghampur. As the Governor-General v/as himself guilty of a similar indiscretion and no secret of that sort is ever likely to be kept Abdullah Khan Zargharapur and the Qashqai nay no.t ineycur - ably^regard the situation with misgiving. 22. Brigadier Humayuni of Ahwaz came to Shiraz with SultaM the deputy and saw the Governor-General for an hour before the latt a flew to Humayuni also saw ..nd im discussdd the situation with mciTibera of th^s consulate. He gaoe the impression ofbeing a man of rare force of character* and was compltetly unrepentant for his provoking trouble for Fars, as well he might be if the Shah and the Chief of Staff were behind him 0 Humayuni has had success with the Arabs of Khuzestan lately ana seems to be thirsting for more blood. He wao uuite unshakeable in his conviction thei t on no account wAuld the Qasgqai take the field in order to help Abdullah Zarghampur. Humayuni clearly indicated that he intended to resume supplying the opposition with ammunition,, 23. The eventual solution of the Boir Ahmedi trouble will pre sumably have to be some sort of arbitration which will unite all the interested parties and dispose of cl ims and counterclaims* oc.But on the/N 3 0 But on the present showing it looks as if before any peaceful settlement can stand a chance of success Humayuni will have to he suppressed or, as he seems unsupi^ressahle, removed- 24. Meanwhile according to Pur Reza the new deputy for Firuz- abad who came to Shiraz straight from visiting Naser Khan Qashqei the latter received appeals for peace from the Prime Minister, thd^Chief of Staff, the Minsiter of V/ar and Morteza o u li Khan. The Governor-General denied that all these had written to laser but in the circumstances it is perhaps just as well that we also rid not bow down in the house of Naser as was at one moment proposed and thus still further enhance his pre/sti^e. Actually however Providence seems to smile on the undesserving anil the heady effect On Naser of all the attention he has been receiving lately was pos sibly mitigatedjby an exceptionally severe attack of sciatica which laid him so low that he had to be parried abou;^ in a chair .1 . 25. Information was received that Brigadier Humayuni, during his stay in Shiraz, planned to arrange for the return of Mohammed Ali Khan Liravi to Qaleh Hissar (see Bushire Diary No 11, para graph vL Steps were therefore taken to, persuade the local Army authorities to take no action in the matter pending the return of the Governor-General. Humayuni, whp happened to be with Cel. Himmat when the subject was broached, admitted hat Mohammed Ali Khan was responsible for the smuggling '''oxxkhi? of arm? and ammun ition in Liravi ports and for trafficking with the tribes. The services of Humayuni in arranging his ret/urn are reported to have bden bought by Mohammed Ali Khan,. ELECTIONS 26. There has been some criticism of the election of Pur Reza for Firuzabad in trhe press where it has been pointed out that in the days of the Pahlevi dictatorship it was the Shah who imposed deputies on' the constituencies. In these democratic days it is Naser Khan Qashoai who distributes the seats. Pur Reza has not even visitdd FiruzaPad and he is so completely unknown there that his constituents are reported to have been asking whether Pur Reza is the name if a fruit or an animal. 27. The Abadeh elections have not yet started but both Khosrcw and Mohammed xiusso in Qashqai have been electioneering in Abadeh. SHI RAZ TOWN 28. The Governor General said befCre he left f ( r Tehran that although he had b-en in his post for two months he had received no money during that period not even his own pay. He had had tC stand personal security for such expenditure as had been incurred for the town and the province, 29. The municipal authorities are seeking approval for borrow ing 20&gt;000 tomans to finish the municipal offices. These offices are one of the three: mejor buildings left unfinished in Shiraz the other tv/c being the hospital and £Le technical school. All were left in an advanced stage of construction and require little beyond window frames, doors and plastering to enable them to be used. 30. The municipality is instituting &amp; tax on bouse property in order to obtain funds. 31. The A.T.O.C, have undertaker to supply bituipan for asphalt ing the main street of Shiraz and wiring for street lighting. The xjos t of the bitumen is 250 tomans xs a ton.' 32. The local electric company has recently received machinery from the United Kingdom which will enable them to light the whole of the frerw town and place them in a strong position for post-war developements 0 33. The Kharbar authorities have suddenly realised that ha^f the year’s production of the sugar factory at Mervdasht, some 3,500 tons, is still lying uncleared at the factory which in consequence is unable to receive the new crop thlat is now ready ..for carting4. for cartings On the personal instructions of Dr• Millspaugh all available transport has therefore been diverted to remove the sugar* One wonders why this matter called for the personal intervention of Dr* Millspaugh and why in a province that has been starved or sugar six month’s stocks were hoarded at the factory* One happy result of Dro Rip van Millspaugh's action has been to bring down the bazaar price of one bag of loose sugar ffom 12,000 riaSis to 6,200 rials and the price of loaf sugar from 500 to S00 rials a 34* The teachers summer vacation course arranged at the British Institute has proved so great a success that at the request of the students themselves it is being continued indefinitely * Seven teen persons took the course. This is admirably, work for, by raising the standard of the teachers, the general standard of English is raised in schools throughout the t^wn and the institute can indirectly influence a very large number of pupils it could not hope to assist directly 0 The work of the Institute has receiv ed favourable notice in the press wherer stress has been laid on £he fact that a foreign language is now being taught in Shiraz with method„ . , , 35. Meanwhile 335 students, including 86 women, habe been enrolled for the regular winter session in addition to 18&gt;5 officers* The latter will form seperate classes and will probably bettught in their own military establishments* One ofc two classes are also being arranged at the Bank Mellie, _ ^ t 36. A number of the elementary classes are b ing taken by local Persians of whom thae are a number, including former students of the C.M.S. college in Isfahan* with an excellent knowledge of English, This is a wise measure because the early stages, includ ing the teaching of the alphabet, can perhaps be taught.better Uy Persians and the precious services of the two full-time English members of the staff will not be waste d on pupils who may drop eut after a few lessons* The employment of some Persian teachers in the Institute will allow the English masters to concentrate on ghe Officers f slasses, the Bank classes and to t/achle the Tech nical School where the foreign language in use has hitherto been German* . 37. It? has now been suggested to Mr* Sanderson, Director of the Institute, th&amp;t he should consider extending the Council s activities in sOme firm or other to Important centres in the pro vince such as Abadeh, Kazerun etc. and arrangements are being made for him to visit these places with suitable instructions ahd ass- istsnce so as t^ study local heeds and possibilities on the spot, PARS PROVINCE 38, There has been a recrudescence of incidents on the road* Capt.

Previous to this four trucks were held up on September 11, 12 and 13 but not shot at. These trucks were empty* On September 15 two mote trucks, one with a load of coke and the other wmpty, were shot at and the drivers robbed in the vicinity of Sa’adetahad* On September 11 an attempt was made to heir 1 up Sit Geoffrey Prior, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, six miles outside Shiraz on the main Isfahan road* In the latter case the road was barricaded but the chauffeur was able to turn the car quickly and get away while a couple of shots passed harm lessly overhead, Liuut, Lemon, tT,D.F. . passing the spot three quarters of an hour later found an abandoned and rifled E.B.R* truck at the barricade, 39, Arrests have Veen made among tl 3 Khamseh tribe for raiding canf %3 so far away as the borders of ^alu chest an.

Grain collection is proceeding satisfactorily, encouraged by uhe distribution of monopoly goods, and the present month is a peak month. Among the tribes the Mamassani and Qashqfci are playing up well but the Khamseh are maintainingntheir low reput ation: they sell their surplus v/heat in the black market of Yezd. 42. stocks of grain in the silo on Septembe r 15 am- unted to 5,330 tons of wheat and 5,300 tons of barley* In addition there were 2,400 tons of v/heat and 1.250 tons of barley lying in stores in the province awaiting transport to the silo. 43. Progress of purchases has been good though t^e recent holidays have h a d an adverse affect on collection. An average of 150 - 200 tons purchased daily is being maintainedWheat purchases are far in excess of those of barley. Collection is now going well in the colder areas where previously there had been a lag - in particuldrSa'adetabad, Qaderabad and Abadeh. 44. The main difficulty encountered lias been the shortage of I.G.Pool trucks to clear out the smaller anbars most of which provide only temporary storage. The sack situation has been itmproved by the receipt of used sacks from Bushire. Foney for purchases is now being received regularly from Tehran. / t British Consulate, Shiraz, 20 September, 1944.

Reports have been received dufcing the period under review from b-sth Army and Mamassani circles that Malek Mansur intended to attack the Mamassani. Naser when questioned on this subject entirely denied anyh such intention an. the story savours of an attempt by the Mamassani to squeeze arms and ammunition out of the Government* 12.

As the Shah and the Prime Minister had assured the Qashqai that the Semirum incident was closed Naser saw in the court judgement a menace that at any moment, in the near or distant future, he might be hauled up for trial. 15. The tribes as^ whole ire moving to winter quarters, Naaer Qashqai for instance has come down from Semirum to just outside Shii&gt;az and AT dull.ah Zarghampur is reported to have left Tal-e Khosrowi which place has been a tone of contention between him and the exposing party.

According tc the latest information from Abadch only 300 people out of an electorate of 10,000 exer cised their right to vote and these were bribed by the local Qashqai agent.

The building taken in the most modern andjthe tallest new building in Shiraz and its aoeuisition is a stroke of good fortune. The accomodation is fully adequate for teaching club and secretarial needs and could provide for- a restaurant.

G It had been ^he Governor-General’s intention t« send laser wiWh Colonel Himmat to the Mamassani. Brigadier Humayuni from Ahwaz however took advantage of his presence in Shiraz to raise objections tr this plan on the score that the presence of Naser woiild utsset the local balance of power. Naser accordingly went off in a huff to Firuzabid and lafcer complained to me that gavam ul Mulk CO' Id interfere in Mamassani and so could the Shiraz deputy Muaddel but not he laser Khan.

He was told to approach^- the Crovern^r'^Oeneral and the latter told him to do nothing about it for th' l resnitt. The fov^nor^Teneral subseauently explained to me that it had been agr .d when he was in Tehran that as the Govecnjoent did not wish (because 0 f the Russians)to hold elections in vacant constituencies in the north no steps should be taken to proceeo with the Lar election. The Governor-'leneral added that if he had be^n in office when the Shiraz electionswere hold he would have ensured the elution of Naser Khan Qoshoal for Shiraz in spite of the Shah s instructions to the '-ontrary. The Governor-General added that in his view Naser /as aiming at parliamentary immunity. 14.

H.G.JAKINS“V The change of the seasons fr^m spring to autumn 1944 has seen, a distinct turn of the wheel in the evolution f Fans. Politically this southern province is largely concerned wioh tribes of v/hich th&lt;e' Qashnai form the largest group and last spring Naser Khan Q.ashqai was still the man vho had defeated the army at Semiruni and was unreconcilec to the central government.. The oppoprtunit.y for enlisting him on the side of organised government was thrown I away when the Shah cfderod the,manipulation of the elections in ' Shiraz, where fTaser headed the .poll, that he should he denied a stfat in the hajles. Fascr did not come in when the Shah paid his first visit tc Shiraz in the early sum, . r and although the Shah statid that bygones weso to he bygones baser, in both fear 1 and resentment, retired tq the mountains and sulked, 2,- Qavam ul Hulk, the Governor-General, was sulking too but he in^Tdhran. General Jehanbani who took over the conduct'of political affairs in the absence, as be had done in the presence, of the. Governd'r-General was mercifully removed to Tehran and after a long wait the-province received General Gobam-ed Hussein Firuz, a ^ajar prince who had dene a previous spell of duty here as Governor-Gen eral.- - 3, General Firuz, who has a strong personal attachment tc Pars having spent some of his youth here when nis father was Governor- General* sedn set about repairing the provincial fabric. Hie plans suffered interruption by his departure to Tehran to consider accepting the post of Minister of War but after an absence of over a month, during which he refused the proferre 1 ministerial post, the Governor-General returned to Shiraz and resumed'his able and . highly popular rule. 4, The Shah was not only responsible for the spell on the mountain tops of Naser Khan but also for ' r he continuance of- disturbed re lations amojiGK the Koir Ahnedi. The policy of the- Shah is apparent ly to eliminate*--tribal..trouble by eliminating the tribes and he has found an-eager\instrument for the execution of this policy in Brigadier Humayuni the forceful co.iimander of troops in Ahw^z who has had a recenlf sifc.ccss in. stringing up some of the ^rahs unfort unate enough-to find themselves under Per-si m rule, 5, 'Aio Shah-has apparently yet to realise that a fr%h v/ind is blowing among the tribal hills. There is a lessening of attach ment td tribal,life and to old tribal loyalties so tl at now v/ith the sfecisl circumstances arising out of- the war. including the distribution of ..monopoly golds, is the time, to wean^the tribes dver tf the government side,, ^he tribes are not likely to discard /dep- their/instincts ov .might but if a ser~'or effort were made now ohy/ dispose of outstanding disputes, including land claims, and to settle tbe tribes on the land very considerable headway could he made' tow the benefit hf the government, of the trihespeople them- aelveg-and of security in general, o* The Govern'r-Gcneral with more inte 1 ligence and experience than his royal master se'ems to 'e w-rkin; Gn bhe right lines but th£re is little real cooperation between the governorates of Shiraz ani Ahwaz sc far as borderline tribes which are the most restive ^dneerned, Naser Khan Qashqai sinco his return from isolation ab the c ' o ' ....beginning of Kjt&gt; ._Q_ ¥oginning ofthe month of October has been m ost profuse in his protestations of devotion to the interests of his Majesty 3 ernment and of his desire to serve, us even tt hie oast nreatn. His repeated enquiry is to ash hc'v he can convibe his i ajesty s Government of his sincerity.. Although His Majesty s Ambassador told Naser’s brothers that ar: far as ? &lt;r i3 Majesty s xevernment v^ras concerned the past was past the Qashqai leaders fear that they have too many enemies with long/imemories for them to make headway^ with His Majesty’s Government-. In view of the . charges . o. infniCc- rity which are made against the cfpshqai it is interesting to u. that they ensured the election of Pur Reza for Firuzabad in ment of v/hat they considered to be a debt of honour knowing that they would incur enmity by doing so und particularly^the enmity erf the Tudeh Party because Pur Reza is nrt only the Qashqai s lawyer but Sc^yid Zia’s lawyer too, 3. The Qashoaiand for that matter the whole ..of Pars, want a solid .firm line of policy to be drawn by His Majesty s ^cvernirup.t behind which the south an rally in order, ff ccurse, to^staye of the Russians, baser who has been cast by the Governor-General fer the unenviable role of maintaining order among the tri es with no- official status shows ne great willingness to accept thu.s p^sitif.n and at the moment of writing this report (he changes his mind frequently in his search for solid ground under his feet) is disposed to take his son Abdullah aged 14 abroad to school. I he cnce left Persia if is possible that baser would s :ay away a leng time. He envies his younger brother? their foreign-education and would gladly spread his own wings in bur, pe and the nited States. His a' sence from the country might, if the Court stayed its hand, timpreve the chances of tribal peace in tne south because hift brother Malek Mansur who appears t' have many solid qualities and is reported to be loved where baser is feared would d'ubtlcrw t&amp;k®'thj load in tribal matters. Meanwhile baser, v/ith technical assistance arranged by the Governor-General, is proposing^ans for the permanent settleiiient of some f tne jsjctksQaehqai in the neighh.lurhood of Firuzahad and’for the inception of various 'works rf irrigation in that district at his own expense. The autumn migration ol the tribes took place with few in cidents although two. British officialSj Sir Geo^J,rey Prior -and Captain Budden, were subject to road- attack, the latter stripped and robbed,. The Qashnai have undertaken to pay compensation for property looted around Beiza. Such ether lapses in security as have occurred are'due to i) lack of arm leadership arising from the -.failure of Qavam ul Mulh and the. long delay before the arrival of General Firuz il^ uncertain!tv, both on the part of his tribes -nnd of himself, in the -position of Far r Khan Qashqai and iii corruption in the Gendarmerie. The Persian Army in Pars has net recovered from the demoralisation that followed its defeat in Semirum nor is it numerically strong enough to stand up tothe tribes. Some of the ben-ficial influence of the South Persia Rifle’s still remains ftnd the Commander pfthe Troops under the Gcv6rnor-Gemeral is a former S.P.R c^icer, 10, As the allies ’ ave advanced in Europe (the local Persian nev^r sparew a git.ice for the war in the Par Sa^ - ^) signs ol in stability have appeared in the bazaar where there have been some bankruptcies. Widows are notoriously prey for the specuzator, 16ut a notable feature of the orgy of speculation which has been the chief factor in the inflation that has been sb marked a feature «f Persian ccmrrmrcial life since the entry of the allies into thecouniry* has been the eagerness of all sections of the popu lation to invest miney in the bazaar. Tribal leaders, goverrme rm officials, mullahs, schoolmasters: none has resisted the temptatw n tc make money quickly.

Has caused a stir by having notices -ut in the local newspapers tnat he is now in charge og the Finance Department. It is not clear^ whether Mr. Phillips made t’nia appointment or whether Feili merely bribed the press to print the announcement. In any case Feili seems to he taking quick cash advantage of the situation. Ur. Phillips, whose critics state that he has not spent fifteen days in Snn raz l 'Ue beginning of Bah man (Feb. 19 last), is now reported to to Tehran from Egypt and Feili is expected to join him in tn-rTBipit- al or in Isfahan in order to get his own word in before that of his critics. 9. Feili called at the consulate because he said that ho had heard we had political objections to him. He was informed that wo load no political objections to him or for that natter to anyone el no. a wanted to see a strong Independent Persia and so on. ''ni.li is now r ■ ported to be meeting his critics by saying that he has the support uv&lt; protection of the British. 10. TWO consideraBldHurnhSeon arresj.ed daring'the period arch ,• review. One was Muhammad Taber Iskandiry. the Head of the Kharbar. Iskandiary has a bad reputation particularly in Connexion, w t!' the ^ distribution of monopoly goods. He was arrested following t-e visit, of a departmental inspector and subsequently released but not^restored k to his office. Tie is a brother of the Tudeh deputy bull actu 21 lv owes his appointment in Chiraz to the forme 1 r British consular liason ofl- icer (cereals) here, jh 11. ’’he second arrest was that of Muhammad Hamxxi who Is in charge of the Ghiraz silo. The Chief of Police,- referring to the arrest of . • - Namju, said that it was possible that one of the British officers employed in Fars on grain collection was also implicated. This revives stories reported in Shiraz Diary No: 3, paragraph 21. The Chief of Police was accordingly told thni the consulate would require to be immediately informed of any evidence implicating a B»rJ.tish officer. Progress •* V \ 5^ m- 2 - 12. Progress hhs been Made with tbe tv/o local .fater r.chcnea which are l) piping the town supply and 2^ irrigating the Shiraz plain by bringing in the waters of Shish Pir, a spring about 70 miles aymy. The town water scheme v/as started by a gift of one million tomans by Haj Muhammad Nomazee. His idea was to inclose all present wateresupplies, piirify them and collect 12 ^ interest on his gift ■ for the benefit of a local school and hospital founded by his father. Hussein Kgar, a successful Btishire merchant who lived for over thirty years in Manchester and has now bought a house in Shiraz, has pointed out that psa present water sullies include ’'v/aqf’' water. He therefore proposes that existing supplies bz should be left undisturbed and that the company should sink wells in the Shiraz X'l a i r * anc ^ tap the sub surface water which appears to be abundant. He also proposes that the Nemazee school and hospital should take as its profit a ^roportionate share of the earnings of the company and not a fixed 12 $£ interest on the capital gift. ^ 14. With regard to the Shish Pir v/ater it seems cl&gt; ar that the ^ res ent flow cannot be tapped and that the only practical solution is build a dam to store winter flood water. A gift from the Shah of one million tomans had been set aside for utilisation on the Shish Pir project. Tt looks however as if the Shah has repented his generosity for he has now stated that the sum is to be regarded as a repayable loan. The promoters of the Shish Pir project have agreed to this but suggest l) that the rate of interest payable on the loan should be that paid by the National Bank on fixed deposits i.e. between 2^ and 3$ which in Persian eyes is an entirely ludicrous of invorcoc d) that nu interest should be r aid the io actually wurjvinti and presumably making a profit and 3) that ru i .ay...ent should be spread •over thirty years. The promoters await the Shah’s reply. TRIBAL 15. (Diary No: 9 paragraph 32). It appears that far from persuading Nasir Qashqai to go to meet the Governor-General at Abadeh Khosru dissuaded him from join 0 -. Na-eir sent the Governor-General a letter to say that he was prevented by family bereavment from attending but Colonel Fariborz of the Gendarmerie who went to Nasir’s camp immed iately after the recent of this letter saw there no signs of mourn ing. General Firuz is reported to be angry at Nasir’s failure to ap pear but to attribute his action to Khosru. Khosru wrote to me from X Tehran to say that he would not have time to return to Shiraz be fore he left for America in a coiaple of months’ time. For a youn^g man Khosru has shewn grSje.t capacity for making mischief and his ab sence from Fars, if prolonged, will be very welcome. But if he gees abroad, particularly to America, under* no sort of control he is soon likely to run through his fortune and saddle his family with heavy debts and a dissipated Khosru returning penniles to Persia from a'i'’oad might well work the financial and political ruin of the Oashqai f vr- . . 11 :, 16, Ahmad Khan Kashkuli reported that fighting with a few casualt ies took place between Husein Gull Rustam and All Oaid Giveh on June ' 21 . 17. Fathullah Khan Hint Baud returned to Chiraz from Rush!re on. June 25, 18. Nasir Qashqai sent telegrams to the Ghirnz press stating that roghan, which is scarce in Shiraz, is abundant in the sarhadd*and suggesting that buyers should go out to the tribes. 19.

Naser did not come In when the shah paid hl^/visit to Shiraz In the early suauner and although the ghafr stated that bygones were to be bjgcnes Naser, In both fear and resentment, retired to the mountains and sulked* 2* Qavam ul Mulk, the Governor-General was sulking too but he in Tehran* General Jehanbanl who took over the conduct of political affairs in the absence, as he had done In the presence of the Governor-General was mercifully removed to Tehran and after a long wait the province received General Mohammed Hussein Firua, &amp; Qajar prince who had done a previous spell of duty here as Governor-General* (p.t.o. ) -a-3* General Firua, who has a strong personal attachment to Fars having spent some of his youth here when hie father was Governor- General, son set about repairing the provincial fabric* Hie plans sobered interruption by his departure to Tehran to consider accepting the post of Minister of War after an absence of over a month, during which kmx he refused the pre ferred ministerial post, the Governor-General returned to Shiran and resumed his able and highly klgfc}: popular rule* 4* The Shah was not only responsible for the spell on the mountain-tops of Naser Khan but also for the continuance of disturbed relations among the Boir Ahmedl* The policy ' of the Shah is apparently to eliminate tribal trouble by eliminating the tribes and he has found an eager instrument for the execution of this policy in Brigadier Hfmayuni the forceful commander of troops in Ahwas who has had a recent success in stringing up some of the Arabs unfor tunate enough to find themselves under Persian rule. 5. The Shah has apparently yet to realise that a fresh wind is blowing among the tribal hills.* There is a loosening of attachment to tribal life and to old tribal loyalties so that now, with the special circumstances arising out of the war, including the distribution of monopoly goods, is the time to wean the tribes over to the government side. The tilbes are not likely to discard their depredatory instincts overnight but if a serious effort were made now to dlspfcM of outstanding disputes, including lend claims, end to settle the g tribes on the lend very considerable headway could be made to the benefit of the government, of the tribes people themselves end of security in general. (P.T.O.)U72 6. The Governor—Gener«l with more intelligence and experience than hie royal wjA* master seems to be working on the right lines but there is little real cooperation between the govemorates of shires end Ahwaz so far as borderline tribes which ore the most restive ere cone era ecu ?• Maser Khan Qashqai since his return from isolation at the beginning of the month of October has been most profuse in his protes tations of devotion to the interests of His Majesty*s Government and of his desire to serve us even to his last breath* MiaxrapntaMxxxoc awialrjnciaxtainiakxhowxittxoaBrxflWrtnriaaaxglsxMa^agtyito taxhln*iaaftxteT—frto His repeated enquiry is to ask how he can convince His Majesty's Government of his sincerity* Although Els Majesty Ambassador told N&amp;ser^s brothers that so far as His Majesty's Government was concerned the past was pest the oashqal leaders fear that they have too many enemies with long memories for them t&gt; make headway with His Majesty's Government* In view of the changes of insincerity which are made against the C&amp;ahqal it is interesting to note that they ensured the election of Pur Beza for Firuz&amp;bad in payment of what they considered to be debt of honour knowing that they would incur enmity by doing so and particularly the en mity of the Tudah Party because pur Reza is not only the Qashqal's lawyer but Sevyio Zia's lawyer too* 3* The Qashqal end for that matter the whole of Fare, went a solid, firm line of policy to be drawn by His Majesty's Government behind which the south can rally in order, of course, to stave off the Russians* Naser who has been cast by the Governor-General for the unenviable tow»4~ to accept this position and at the moment of writing this report (he changes his mind freoufint- ly in his search for solid ground under his feet) is disposed to take his son Abdullah aged 14 abroad to school* If he once left Per si* it xs possible tnat N&amp;ser would stay away a long time* He envies his younger brothers th&amp;Lr foreign education and would gladly spread his own wings in Europe and the united States* Els absence from the country might, if the Court stayed its h*id. improve the ttfcsaspt chances of tribal peace in the south because his brother Malek Mansur who appears to have many solid qualities and is reported to be loved where Faser is feared would doubtless take the lead in tribal matters* Meanwhile Naser, with technical assistance arranged by the Governor-General, in proposing plcos for the pexsaanent settlement of some of the casheai in the neighbourhood of Kb Firusabad and for the inception of various workB of irri gation in that district at his own expense. 9 # The autumn migration of the tribes took piece with few incidents although two British officials. Sir Geoffrey prior and Captain Budden, were subject to road attach^ the latter stripped and robbed. The Qashqal have undertaken to pay compensation for property looted around Balsa* Such other lapses in security us have occurred are due to (1) leek of film leadership arising from the failure of Qavsrn ul Mulk and the long delay before the arrival of General Firuz (11) uncertainity, both on the part of his tribes and of himself, in the position of Naser Khan Qashaai and (iii) corruption in the Gendarmerie. The Persian Army in Far® has hot recovered from the demoralisation that followed its defeat in semlrum nor is it numerically strong enough to stand up to the tribes. Some of the beneficial influence of the South Persia Bifles still remains and the Commander of the troops under the Governor-General is a former S.P.R. officer. . (P.T.O.) -6-I n &lt; '-V 10# As the allies have advanced in surope (the local Persian never spares a glance Tor the war in the Par Bast) signs of instability have appeared in the bazaar where there have been some bankruptcies* Widows are notoriously prey for the speculator, but a notable feature of the orgy of speculation which has been the chief factor in the inflation that has been so marked a feature of Persian commercial life since the entry of the allies into the country, has been the eagerness of all sections of the population to invest money in the bazaar* Tribal leaders, government officials, mullahs, schoolmasters* none has resisted the temptation to make money quickly* prices have thus been forced up and although astonishing rates of interest have been paid on invested capital final losses when the crash eventually does come, and it already has come in several cases, will be severe* 11. Such speculation and the manipulation of a black market did not, it is said, exist in Persia during the last war and the present a existence of these evils is attributed to a loosening of the moral/pf the nation following the Europeanisation or the country by Reza Shah* It is curious to notice how completely Persia has taken to western nations* At a time when other Middle Eastern nations are thinking in terns of IslamAnd Pan*Arab movements Persia has leapt across the intervening countries and plumped atradwgpc straight for Europe* Doubtless her shia attachment prepared Persia for this cultural break with her neighbours but she seems to be completely divorced from the tharpafryefreft political tendencies of the Islamic world of to-day* Persia, at least that portion of fcfc it covered by this reports, is unmoved by the Palestinian question and indifferent to panacea of the Pan-Arab order* The local Persian does Ml l° s no? P in°C«!ro 3 or la Cairo or Damascus. i U' [ : Ifii f f i- 6 - nsj Damascus but somewhere In Burope. This e^lains the contemptuous attitude of the Persian to-* waFda India* , 12* The Europeanisation of the Persian is nowhere more noticeable than in his cloihes. No other Middle Eastern country has discarded its traditional dress more than Persia* it xs true that the local women h«ve gone back to tne chador but this is doubtless for utilitarian reasons* The chador is a very convenient fom of dress* it combines headgear and cloaK in one and is very cheep* But all local Persian women wear stockings cheap and shapeless cotton ones, but stockings. And although the ***- ditional blue dress and round felt hat or the peasant are occasionally seen a much more common sight is of men in the fields wearing European overcoats and European felt hats at their wozk* The population in general looks very doen at heel to western eyes chiefly be cause of the gray charity-school material that is the common suiting but also because of the iSi unshaven appearance of the men* The Persians can scarcely be calked a handsome race and the country has a very low percentage of attractive children.- and the Persian nose dominates tne from the Peacock Throne downwards. 23 * The Persian tribes were never noted for their attachment to the practice of relit ion and in contrast to the Near apd Middle East countries it is very rare to seea a Persian praying in the open, even in country districts. On the other taM hand Mullahs with a gift for oratory still attract large congregations and no person of any standing seems to die without a commemorative cele bration often predominantly of a lay character in the mosque* (P.T.0.) -1L14* Two American advisers have been working in the province during the period under review, one military and one financial* Both have been the object of much criticism* The army man has great personal chaxm but shows few signs of acti vity; he has no stomach at all for the hob* The financial expert has certainly arranged for the efficient distribution of monopoly goods even the tribes who had had no rationed goods for years but his organisation is widely reported to be corrupt which to the Persian moans that he him self le implicated* /i third American, wo has paid a number of visits to Pars in connexion with irrigation projects, seems to have had little more local success than his compatriots* The reasons for the failure of the American, on their side, to make themselves acceptable to the Persians are (i) their insularity and lack of adaptibility and (11) their ignorance of the language* In connexion with the latter handicap it is interesting to recall that a few years ago a body of responsible British opinion was maintaining that it wasrf not necessary for British Consular officers in Persia to have a knowledge of Persian* 15* Pars is fort mate in havix^ a few honest government servants and the Governor-General has been able t# transfer out of the province a number of officers and officials who have been actively working for Russian sponsored activities* These activities include a local branch of the Tudeh Party and two local newspapers* Shiraz has nearly twice as many daily newspapers as London and certainly two md possibly more of them are subsidised by the Russitfis* At the moment of writing the publication of three more newspapers and one medical magazine has been authorised one of the jkkIx newspapers being undoubtedly supported by the Russians* Altogether there* •*,.

There have however been moves to compose differences between Naser’s branch of the Qashqai which is the present ruling, f‘amily and former ruling branches as represented by Ali Khan and Amir Hossein respectivelv, Naser has offerred Amir Hossein 3.0''0 tomans monthly which the latter has so far refused on the ground that a strong Persian Government would accuse him of being a paid servant of Naser and so one of the guilty.

During his 'lying visit to Shiraz after seeing Naser. Mohhamed Hossein said that they were prepared to ask Colonel Himmat to act as intermediary for them in disposing of thm case of Ali K K an and his sons. They would if necessary give Himmat full authority to arrange a permanent settlement. With regard to Amir Hossein Mohhamed Hossein said that he would himself arrange a settlement direct. He did not 4 hink that this would present any difficulty as their relations with/Amir /the Hossein oranch had never been disturbed, 18. Meanwhile Ali Khan is reported to have been seen back in Shiraz, his son Chengiz came in for two or three nights and the mother of Chengiz and Amir Mansur has collected the monthly allowance of 140 tomans each paid to them by the army. 19 Malek Mansur Qashqai is to marry a daughter of Jehangir Khan Kashkuli. As leaser's father is said to have killed Jehangir's father and the loyalty of Jehangir to Naser has been open to question the marriage may serve to consolidate the tribal ranks. The marriage was to have taken place immediately but has now been postponed for two months because (according to Mohammed Hossein) of the death of the mother of Naser’s wife. 20 The20.

The Qashqai called a conference of kalantars at Firuzabad on December 29. An unconfirmed report states that representatives from Tangestan and Dashtestan were invited to attend. Nothing is^v as yet known of the subjects discussed but it is assumed that the meeting was called as a result of happenings in Azerbaijan. The appointment of Parrokh as Governor-General of Pars is also likely to have been mentioned. 9. The Shah has granted a general pardon to the tribes of Pars. The Qashqai are the chief beneficiaries from this act of grace that Mohammad Hossein Khan Qashqai the deputy for Abadeh claims/ &lt;V A claims to have prompted, Naser Qashqai is reported to have tele- gr^hed his thanks to the Shah but the telegram has not been published. Military Headquarters have invited tribesmen to register any rifles in their possession. They are not likely to - respond to this invitation. 10. The general pardon undoubtedly lifts a great weight from the shoulders of the Qashqai. Pear that they would one day be brou^it to book for having routed Government forces and seized their arms at Semirom in 19^3 have lain heavy on them and was one of the reasons for Naser’s being afraid to come in to Shiraz and meet the Shah in May and his avoidance, until July 1945# of Tehran. The Shah’s act benefits both sides. It removes possible opposition to the Government in the south when it is fully occupied with events in the north and gives the tribes an inducement to be loyal. The tribes do not of course trust „ the Shah or any Government in Tehran. __ ^ SHIRAZ TOWN 11. Parrokh, the new Governor-General, has had a difficult start. According to Qavam, Sa’ed the former Prime Minister, who would have been a better choice for Governor-General, had actually been persuaded to come to Shiraz when the Shah, seeing that^Gne^^ people of Pars were sending telegrams of congratualtion to Sa’ed on his appointment, stopped him from coming, Parrokh was appointed in spite of the opposition of Qavara, the Qashqai, the deputies for Pars and, it is understood, the British Embassy. He was announced as bringing a new Assistant Governor-General and a new Mayor for Shiraz with him. The present Mayor is a local ✓ newspaper owner and not a civil servant. Threatened with the loss of his post he started to organize opposition to Parrakh and with the help of Khosru Qashqai composed a telegram for despatch to Parrokh telling him to turn back. Qavam ul Mulk heard of this and, arguing that national outweighed provincial interests and that the position of the central Government must not be weakened by opposition in the south nor the hands of the Russians strengtlengu by their being able to point to unrest in Pars, stopped the despatch of the telegram. He also nipped in the bud a movement to dissuade officials from going out of the town, as is customary, to meet the incoming Governor-General. No local notabilities went out to meet Parrokh but a number of them called on him at the Governorate after he arrived there. Qavam himself, Mohammed Hossein Qashqai the deputy and Khosru Qashqi did not go out to meet or call to greet Parrokh. tf Ur h 12. Immediately after his arrival it was urged, chiefly by the two younger Qashqai, that Parrokh should return at once to Tehran and then be invited by the people of Pars to take up the appointment of Governor-General. They were finally persuaded that it would be better to postpone putting this plan into execution for a few weeks when the position of the Government and the political situation with regard to Azerbaijan would, it was hoped, be clearer. Parrokh who stands to profit by this period of grace (and may be expected to do so) does not want to leave Shiraz. He has the rare reputation of being an honest official. The declared objection to him is that he is excitable. Actually the Qashqai (as represented by the two younger brothers) seem to consider that they should say who is to be Governor-Generals in Pars. Precisely what Naser thinks is not known as h© has not been in to Shiraz. Qavam who has been out to see him claims that he has persuaded him, in the national interest, not to press tfis opposition to Parrokh. Mohammad Hossein Qashqai admits hie respon sibility as a deputy sufficiently to adopt, with some reluctance, a reasonable attitude wlth regard to a -j r- n ;n,p- here_, ££P. the f present/present. Khosru Qashqai is swayed only by his own impetuosity and is no sooner stopped from organising one intrigue against Farrokh than he starts another. Khosru is a dangerous man because he is as blind as he is unrestrained and quite fearless. Farrokh wants to get Khosru out of Shiraz and Khosru’s record gives the Governor-General every justification to anticipate trouble so long as Khosru stays here. 13. Meanwhile Farrokh is taking steps to set up a provincial council for Pars and is borrowing money to asphalt the sir ets of Shiraz and to complete the halfi-f ini shed municipal offices. 14* According to the Governor-General it was the Shah who suggested that he should bring with him a new Shahrdar (Mayor) to Shiraz to replace Gulestan against whom complaints had been sent to Court. Nawab who is Farokh’s choice for the post arrived in Shiraz on December 29 but has not taken over his duties. Farrokh is retaining Gulestan so as to have one less enemy to fight while he settles himself more securely in the saddle. There is also a case against Gulestan in the public courts and Farrokh hopes that the court decision will go against Gulestan and so facilitate his dismissal. Nawab is reported to have served with the British in Bagdad during the last war and to have been formerly Governor of Bushire. 15 . Khaveri, the representative of Seyyed Zia in Shiraz, who recently returned from a visit to the capital left again for Tehran by air on December 27 . The rift between Seyyed Zia and the Qashq.ai seems to be widening and each side is becoming increasingly critical of the other. Khaveri showed himself to be particularly anxious that the Qashqai should not succeed in ousting the new Governor-General. 16. Naubakht, a former Majles deputy and associate of th^ Germans who during the war found refuge among the Qashqai, paja a brief visit to Shiraz returning to Tehran on December 25* He went to Firuzabad and also called at the consulate# It has been suggested that the object of his visit was to dun Naser Qashqai fpr tooney. 17* Sarhang Safavi, Head of the Department for the collection of Grain, paid a short visit to Shiraz from Tehran. Staff changes in the local organisation are expected to follow. Samrod the inspector who temporarily took over charge of the local department returned to Tehran apparently under a cloud. 18# Arrangements have been made to retain the P,R.B. reading room in Shiraz for the month of January. News is broadcast from 6.0 p.m. onwards. It attracts a good audience and by keeping the public abreast of developernents in the north helps to maintain quiet in the south. 19. No further reports of the black market rates for sterling and dollars will be given as it now appears that the local rates are based on the Tehran rates. PRESS 20. ’’Surush” the one remaining Tudeh newspaper in Shiraz was released from suspension and reappeared to'^ards the end of the month.21. The Tehran Tudeh press took advantage of the presence in the capital of Afifi who is the editor of 'Surush' to entertain him and to ask why so much attention was paid to Azerbaijan and so little to Pars. Pars was represented to he a colony of Qavam (himself the tool of foreigners) where not the slightest step was taken without the consent of this consulate. The acts of the consulate in opressing and silencing people were wit out parallel. The people themselves were brave but had no escape fron the 100 f Q00 Bakhtiari spearheads and the 50#000 rifles held at their throats. (it is not clear why the Bakhtiari who are outside the borders of this province should be quoted as menacing Pars nor why the Mamasaani, of ail the tribes within Pars, should be singled out for mention.) 22. The Shiraz press has given the Government loyal support on the question of Azerbaijan. A tendency to criticise the new Governor-General has been suppressed. The newspaper ”Jehan-e Ma” which is friendly to the Qashqai printed one article against Parrokh but when the attention of the Qashqai was drawn to it they siad that they had already asked the proprietor to refrain from criticism. PARS PROVINCE 23. An engineer (Russian with a Lebanese passport and apparently unexceptionable) has gone to Jahrom in connexion with the irrigation scheme referred to in paragraph 27 of diary No. 19* 24« The Shiraz Chamber of Commerce has telegraphed to the Minister of Roads (formerly Governor-General of Pars,) asking that the road between Bushire and Shiraz and Shiraz and Isfahan should be asphalted- The Minister has replied that he plans to do so. This seems to be mutual leg-pull between the parties concerned. In any case the first thing to do with the Bushire road is to change the alignment between Dashtarjen and Kazerun and so eliminate two unnecessary passes. 25 . A number of the tribal khahs have been coming in to Shiraz and have been recommended to visit the Governor-General. Among them were £iad and 2aki Khans Larrehshuri. SKCuRITY 26. The additional battalion of Gendarmerie posted to the Shiraz - Isfahan road (see paragraph 31, diary No. 19) was with drawn when Tehran appeared to be menaced from the north. Security on this road has not deteriorated. 27 . There have been two attacks by M armed robbers’* on the road between Sarvestan and Pasa with the loss of one life. The Governor of Pasa states that the culprit is Ahmad Qohestani (see paragraph 18 diary No. 17) but the Military consider that the culprits are the Parsi sub-tribe of the Arabs and that Ahmad f *ohestani is blamed because the Governor of Pasa is also Supervisor of the Khamseh and does not want to admit the guilt of th&lt;e tribes under his charge.

The Municipal authorities have been trying to force down the cost of living by fixing maximum prises and by doling out j/unishm^jvts of fifty lashes for ove v ^harming. The immediate result has been the disappearance from the i^^rkelj' of various articles of food and the closing of the Ti^otmakers and sweet-sellers shops, another result was ’fc strike'of bootmakers' apprentices.

Meanwhile the British Institute in Shiran has formed a ladies’ section whidh is having great success, 15, Many cases have been reported during ohe last few months of a fever that Is called Malta or recurring fever,' Some soi l of cold - said to have been brought from Isfahan - has affected all the dogs fo Shiraz. TUD'EH I There has been a sudden expansion in Pars of Tudeh activiities that are here conveniently assembled under one heading. The number of adherents to the Tudeh in Pars has l hitherto been derisory but obviously the party is now f making a very big effort to gather strength for the forthcoming elections. IT. On May 1 the Tudeh Club at Mervdasht, where t icre is a sugar factOi.-y, was reope red with some ceremony. The club was burnt down last year at the instigation of two mullahs sent there apparently by the local Democrat Party who &lt;paid 700 tom ms for the completed job.' 18. It is noteworthy that not a single worker left any of the Shiraz factories’ to go to Mervdasht although free transport was provided and a uromise of two tomans and a meal. To provide ostensible d :monstrotors and fill their iorrla# the Tudeh was forced to hire casual labourers for the day, According to Gendarmerie reports three hundred men were collected from Sivand and Zargar, two villages roughly north and south of Marvdasht and three hundred from Shiraz* j Of the three speakers at the reopening one demanded the I restoration of Bahrein to Persia and .he other two urged their hearers to be sure to get their rations. 19. Tudeh agents have been busy throughout the month at Kazerun Dasht--e Arjen and other places on the Bushire road and^have made first visits to villages in the A -clekan valley including Khollar where g^ap for the Shiraz wine supposed to come frvn and Qa .at a fine village now in the possession of Qawam ul Mulk'o sister.

PARS PROVINCE 23 ^ The period under review has been notable for the differences of opinion be tween Qawar ul Uulk and the Qanqai. The former accuses the latter of being responsible for tne removal of the members of the Qawam family anl their proteges as shewn in the list of suspended of-°i&gt; ials ^ V en in para 3, diary No* A . Qawam ul Mull states that Khosru Qas^ iai has made an ar angement -’ith Muzaffir Piruz whereby Firuz will } be elected to the majles for Aladeh (Mohammed Hossein Qashqai s former constituency), Qav/am’ s influence eliminated and he Qashqai rule the ro ri ’t in Pars. 24.

As Kashkuli allegiance to the Qashqai has &gt;een considered generally shaky and Jehangir’s personal loyalty to the ruling family most in doubt the marriage should serve to consolidate tribal ties. 27, Naser Qashqai shrew a surprise by publishing the text of a telegram he had addressed to the Prime Minister condemning the uee of coercive measures against Azerbaijan. 28, It so happened that shortly after the publication of this telegram Fereidun Kashkuli (see diary No. 5, para 8) called at the consulate for advice in face of tie increasing pressure that was being brought to bea 1 on him to gc to see Naser in Semirom, He was advised that at leas.: he night go and see why he was wanted and at the same time get some informatior ab ut Naser’s policy which i' its latest manifestation was far from clear. 29, Following Fereidun’s visit to Semirc i Mohammad Hossein Qashqai came to Shiraz He said that the Qashqai were dogged ‘politically by bad lick. Naser’s intention in publishing the. telegram was not to show sympathy wi i:h the Tudeh or the Russians and that he Mohammad Hossein was prepared to issue a statement in the local press to that effect if ye thought it desirable, Mohammad Hossein was told thai Naser by the telegrams he was repeatedly sending (e.g. the one where he resigned leadership of the Oashaai and changed his mind immediately, a^terwards^ had made himself a laughing-stock in Shiraz and :f an explanation of his latest, telegram were new published Nase would merely look more ridiculous than ever. 30, As it is usually the qashqai who get the consulate in a corner by asking for guidance :n mr tters of policy advantage was taken of this rare opportunity of turning the t bles on them to tell Mohammad Hossein that it was ^ery painful to the consulate to see its friends made into figures of thm. And ao l aser is always complaining that he is left unenlightened, on questions of policy the opportunity was a_so taken to review Naser’s u/n behaviour. After years of enmity and after harbouring German jparach lists and building an aerodrome at Farrashbard the ^ashqai had two years ego become reconciled wit* His Majesty’s Government. Sinse that time they had given His Majesty’s Government no chance to build up confidence wliuv them. Every few months throughout those two years something ha^. ened, e.g. Naser’s telegrams, to shake con:iaen*n; in Qhe Qashqai. i hen their own policy was so obscure how could., they expect His Majesty’s Government to produce enlightenment ?. 31, This is very far from being uhe whole story bu’ tellin_ it made a welcome change in the relations of this consulate with the Qaahqai vwhich/generally consist in warding off avuward questions, in evasive replies and in maintaining what it is hoped v. r ila pass as pop-ten toms silences. Mohammed Hossein Q^shqa i said he was ashamed and even looked it. 32 .A* PERSIAN DFPICI/-LS, MILITARY OPFIGSHS AND CIVILIANS MviX Ol’^iciale 1, Khalil Dashti, f^'mer deputy for Bushire, paid a flying visit o Shiraz towards tae end of the month. 2, Khosru Qa8hq.ai arrived by air from Tehran on July 17. 3, He left v/ith his b ’other Malek'Mansur for Khosru Shirin in the Qashoai summer quarters on July 26 and returned to Shiraz alone on July 29, Military Officers 4.

The strike at the tv/o spinning mills ended after 16 days by the men returning v/ith a reduction of working hours to aighc daily, wages to he fixed subsequently. The local Tudeh who vnme paying the men stiike-pay are reported to have run out of funds and a repros ntativo of the mill-ovmers claims to have t ipped a telegraphic conversation between the Tudeh in Shiraz and the Tudeh in Tehran when Dr. Radmanesh gave instructions that the strike mu it it all costs he brought to an end. This report much encouraged the mill-owners who throughout did not lose their heads. They stated trot the Governor- General behaved very well and went so far as to be helpful when he might have been neutral or weak. One Government official came out of 'he affair badly : Parham the local Director of Art and Industry. ,: le i as a member of the Iran Party and joined up with the Tut eh. He ha sine. 1 left Shiraz for Tehran', ^he collapse of the strike was accelerated by demonstrations of workless claiming the vacated jobs. 9. The announcement of the formation by the Pr*ine Ministf r of a new party was at first well received chiefly perhaps' because of r London wireless broadcast on June 30 that local Persians took to me^n that the party was being backed by Hi's Majesty's Government. Thi '•e already exists in Shiraz an independent, conservative body crl'.^c the Democrat Party but in taking this title for his own party fje . ri ne Minister was doubtless aiming at stealing the thunder of f O e .'-a 2 e *baijan democrats. One newspaper of the local Democrat party e '' ' j y printing the new party’s -programme without comment 4 excentfor a reference to the ’'beloved' Prenter of Persia. The Dehgan farily who are wealthy landlords, own one* of ,the Shiraz s^innin^ factories and the electric li^ht plant and had a deputy in the last yarllament were antions to t tke over the local organisation of the party themselves. A considerable number of tele.granft if congratulation were sent locally to the' Prime Minister but in Shiraz itself no rGS^oHSihle body or person went so far as to align it or nimaelf definitely with the party and this attitude of caution changed towards the end of the month to coldnuss v/hen the memberfe of the central committee of the party v/ere announced and Tudeh supporters were found among them. 10» The Governor-General 6 aid that he had had a personal letter from the Prime Minister about the new party saying that it had been formed to safeguard the interests of the country without leaning to one side or the other. But the Governor- General too had his doubts v/hen he saw the namesof the centre 1 committee. 11. The appointment of Rhosru hashnai as representative in Pare of the new portydrove away many possible supporters. But Naser telegraphed to the Prime Minister announcing the adherence of the Qashqai to the new party and the people of Semirom telegraphed similarly to Khosru. Subsequent information showil that the tritee is by no means behind the brothers iri this move and only Elias Kashkuli and Ahmed Kashkuli have come out ’.n o^en support of it. 12. Khosru Qashqai got su4h a poor reception in Shiraz 'in connexion wl^h the new party that he seems to have decided to take no active steps to get the local branch T&gt;inp -.md to have sent for some-one else from ehran. 13. The Governo.-General stated that he had protested to the Prime Mini* ter on his selection of Khosru as party representative in Tv.rt. The Commander of r 'roops seated that he had taken similar action. 14. The Mullahs of Shiraz attempted to close the bazaar as a protest agajnst the'arrest of Afeul Qasin Kashaai The local Democrat Party -laims to have induced the Governor -General to warn tradespeople against any such demonstration with the result that the bazaar remained open. 15. KhaliL Dashty, who is a director of the Luohire spinning mill persuae id Hussein Agar, chairman and managing director of the company, to retm a to Bufthire and resume charge of the milx. (see para 13, diary No. 6 ). Towards the end of the month Agar was talking confidently of resuming activities in connexion v/ith the piping of the town water supply and various other ecncmes in the province.

They paid the existing tenant 4,000 tomans to suit and their monthly rentals 600 tomans* The garden was used as meeting-place for the mill- strikers, The club has installed a loud-speaker in the street through which it broadcasts Tabriz radio and local talks, Persian love of scurrility explains the presence of the considerable crowds ''“'hat gather to listen to this loud speaker. The listeners are certainly not all Tudeh party members. RUSSIANS INTERESTS 21. Nicolas Denissov, Russian .Vice-Consul from Isfahan and Piotre Koullkof, Secretary of the Shiraz Consulate arrived in Shiraz on July 7 to open a Soviet Consulate in the town. The former Soviet Consulate here closed down about ten years ago. The new arrivals are experiencing considerable difficulty in finding premises large enough for their purposes. 22. The Perso-Soviet fjltural Society held a garden-party to raise funds. Invitations to this consulate arrived too late to be of use* Mariam Piruz came down from Tehran for the occasion. 23. Three Russian writers including a poet from Russian Azerbaijan arrived in Shiraz and addressed a literary meeting held in one of the local schools. Invitations to this nee tin-, issued by the local Director of Education, also arrived in the consulate too late to be of use. 24. The Russian consular staff gave a film show on July 29 in one of the local cinemas. Tickets for this arrived in good tine but as the subject matter was gymnastics (in technicolour N only Mr. Vice-Consul Magee was present from the consulate. He found himself in the company of the goVerhor^General, the Commander of Troops, most of the high officials and Khosru Qashnai. PARS' PROVINCE 25. In the early part of the month Fathullah Haiat Daud cane to Shiraz with the object of joining the recently-formed union of sheikhs on the littoral with other groups and with influential persons in Pars so as to form a block that night be in a position to wrest from the Government provinicial autonomy for Pars similar to that obtained by Azerbaijan, Tackling the biggest difficulty first Haiat Daud went to Naser Qashqai. While he was on his way the announcement was made of Qashqai adherence to the Prime Minister’s party and of the appointment of Khosru Qashqai as leader of the party in Pars. Haiat Daud thought that if he had gone to see Naser a fortnight earlier he night have stopped the Qashqai from committing themselves. 26. It seems that the real attreation of the Prime Minister for the Qashqai is hms apparent willingness to help them regularize their holdings of lands in Pars. A commission is said to have been appointed for this purpose* ‘27. Naser explained to Haiat Daud that he bad fallen in with Khosru’s suggestion that they should join the new party as a drowning man clutches al a straw and in despair on hearing a report brought by Khosru that His Majesty’s Government regarded the Qashqai with unalterable enmity. 28. -In spite of this both Malek Mansur and Khosru in Shir'az towards the end of the month declared that they would never take any ste* that conflicted with the interests of His Majesty’s Govt, 29. According to the Commander of Troops Khosru Qashqai is intriguing to have Fatimi the present Governor-General removed and replaced-4- peplaced by Sadr Pakhr (Reza Hiknat^ forner deputy for Shiraz and recently appointed O-overnor-S-eneral •eor Keman. Hi km at is very friendly with the Oashqai and was a member of the left '‘minority' in the last majles. 30 Kazerun has been changed from a Baksh to a Shahrasaan. ' TRIPP S 3^ There has been some activity in connexion with the Hovernorshil of the Khamseh* Since the removal of the sarparast (supervisor) Amir Arfa the governor Sahebdivani has shewn himself increasingly unable to handle the sitauation. Although Sahebdivani is a member of the Qawami family Qawam ul MuIk wrote to the Governor-General pressing that Mohammad Hussein Arab Sheibani should be made Governor in his stead* Rumours were also circulating that Amir Sadri was to be appointed. among 32. On the one hand there was strong opposition tm the Khamseh to Amir Sadri and on the other it was possible that if Mohammad Hussein Arab were appointed there might be a drift towards Qashqai, The Governo-General when asked his intentions said, that he proposed temporarily to awt as sarparast himself and was on the look-out for seme neutral person to replace Sahebdivani, 33. According to Mr. Vice-Consul Magee the Qashqyi In their summer quarters spend their evenings listening to Radio Tabriz and getting more and more depressed. yRESS 34. The Governor-General’s attention was drawn to a headline in the local Tuueh Press which ran 'Death to the English capitalists of the Oil Company who instead of bread shdV; the shells of the jams of their warships 'to Persian workers'. The Governor-General was reminded that it was the Tudeh itsel p that started a campaign against the exi)ort of foodstuffs to Abadan, (see ^ara 33 diary No. 5). SECURITY 35* The O.ashqai are reported to have stolen 600 sheep from the Arabs on July 3, to have killed one girl, wounded another and two boys. 36. An omnibus v/as held up at Takht-e Ta*us which is the defile on the Isfahan road immediately north of Persepolis and stripped 30 persons'* wounding two. This Is stated to have been the work of Arabs. 37. Arab tribesmen are also held to be responsible for holding up a lorry near Dehbid when some cases of tea were stolen. 38. According to the Govern or--Gene ral a copy of the letter concerning Khosru Qashqai and se4urity in Jahrun and Pasa waswsent to the Shiraz Gendarmerie. Khosru immediately followed this up with the suggestion that security around Shiraz should be assured by Qashqai under Elias Khan Kashkuli. The Commander of Troops objected and said that if Qashqais started moving about armed around Shiraz it would be their own fault if they got shot up. When the Governor-General complained to the Prime Minister the latter said he knew nothing bout the report but eventually traced it to Muzaffer Firuz. British Consulate H.G.JAKINS Shiraz.

Khcsru Qashqai as leader of the Hizb-e Democrat Iran issued a manifesto against reactionaries and then seems to have taken no active share in the party’s activities. The party has taken over the former Saadi Club as its headquarters. On August 6 three persons arrived from Tehran to infuse a- little life into the party* They were Mohammad Wall Mirza Flman Pirmaian (brother of General Plruz^, jTaeer Ferhadpur and Abul Qasim Naraqi, In due course Firman Firmaian returned to Tehran leaving the local organisation in the hands of Ferhadpur a young man formerly member of the Tudeh. The Prime Minister’s party has made no headway at all in Shiraz. 15. The Prime Minister’s orner been generally ignored by leading fe# * &gt; about association v/ith consulates has local Persians and by some officials. Members, not including the Public Prosecutor, of the Dehgan family 1 ! immediately severed contacts with the entire British colony out later resumed them. 16. The Governor-General received ord Zia’s representative -and the able editor The Governor-General told m ehran that he rs to arrest Khavari, Seyyid of the newspaper Iradeh-e Fars dare not arrest Khavari (which waswas a gross exaggeration) and nean vhile gave Khavari the'trip to&gt; get away. Kha^ari has accordingly gone into hiding. 'TUP EH 17* The Chief Tndeh activity has been in connexion with the. loud-^ s^T—^ker they installed outside their new club in the main street. They were told by the police to put the loud-speaker inside. Presumably when a town is under martial law the authorities are justified in taking steps to prevent the assembly of crowds in the streets. The Tudeh demanded a written request and when this was refused con:inued to use the loud-speaker outside. On August 29 a police officer attempted to seize the l.&gt;ud-speaker, there was a scuffle, one or two shots seem to have been fired and the door of the club broken in. There was another similar slight disturbance on the night of August 30* Finally the Tudeh placed the loud-speaker just inside the door so that -pas se ms-by can hear all that is broadcast through it. 18, In connexion with these incidents the Tudeh have twice distributed leaflets attacking the Gove-rnor-General as a reactionary undermining the work of the. Prime Minister. 19, The temper of the town has remained unruffled. . 20, One of the last acts of the suppressed Iradeh-e Pars v/os ,to accuse the Tuden of trying to induce local bakers to go on strike. HUSSIAN 'INTERESTS ' ' 21* One of the two Russians who came to reopen the Soviet Consulate in Shiraz is reported to brave returned to Isfahan. After much difficulty the Russians have obtained a'house opposite the local military headquarters. They are looking for other houses and are said to be bringing a large commercial staff to Shiraz. 22. The Persn-Soviet Cultural Society has given a number of lectures on subjects such as Religion under the Soviets an^ Education in Russia, PARS PROVINCE 23. The set-back in the formation of a block in Pars aiming at provincial autonomy proved only temporary. The Qashqai were at first inclined to p 2 ace their hopes In the Prime Minister’s new party rather than in the proposed block. One of their reasons for this decision was their fear that 'without some guiding hand the various elements in the proposed block would never agree. TheY pointed out that the Tudeh in Shiraz which consisted virtually of four young men was a power because it had the strong support of the Russians. Only Great Britain could supply the stiffening that Pars needed but as she showed no sign of doing so the Qashqai were forted to clutch at any passing straw. Qawam us Sultaneh had been extremely nice to them; there were many people of standing in ’Shiraz anxious to lead the new I party locally so that it w uld be to the advantage of the Qashqai to have the org anisation of the party in their hands; .the party wculd be bound to cook the'next elections and then the Qashqai would be well placed to have several fingers in the pie. So ’they deciced to support the Prime Minister’s pa'rty rather than the union. Khosru went so far as to say that if Tehran crumpled up they might still save Pars f/om within the new party. 24. When they invited consular comment on their decisk n* the suggestion was made to them that it might not be to its advantage for the tribe to be identified with one particular party and that by joining 'a party they gave up their ^reedon to make their own decisions and placed themselves under the orders of party leaders in' Tehran. The names of the colleagues of the Prime Minister had not been announced and they, the Qashqai', might wake up on- morning to find that they had been handed over to the Tudeh. This is almost what happened, When the central committee of the party was formed it included a number of m udeh supporters and this news Khosru 'Qashqai gmokj n ultf , ■ \ tooK very badly. He appeared in public visibly shaken md said t&gt; at the obvious solution for Pars lay in forming the autonomy block as quickly as possible. He thereupon got in touch with the Mamassani- Doshmanziari group and signed an agreement with them. He said he would also accept any settlement of the Badgerr land question provided it entailed no loss of face to himself. He got in touch with the local Democrat Party (a conservative body unconnected with other parties in Persia calling themselves Democrats) and would have sought, and doubtless secured, the collaboration of Qav/am ul Mulk i'^'Oav/am had been in Shiraz and not in forced or voluntary exile in Tedran. /&gt;s it was Khosru, in spite of the seizure, of Zarghmi (see next paragraph'' cane to a working agreentn with the Kharnseh the tribal confederation in Pars that is identified with Qawam ul Mulk. *.5. In order to impress the public with the strength of tho? Qashqai and at the same time to discredit the local administration Khosru had a Raseri kalantar, Mohammad Zarghami, carried off in broad daylight at the point of the revolver in front od the head quarters of the Military S-overnor. In sjjite of the interventir-n of the Gove mor-General Khosru has not given up Zarghami. Phosru subsenuently claimed that when Questioned by Q.awam os Sult'meh about this abduction he replied that he would carry off Hser Khan himself if he opposed the Prime Minister Naser 26, On August 24 typewritten notices of a 'Movement for the Defence of the South” 'were posted in the bazaar and sen 1 , to various addresses in Shiraz. The notices stated that the tribal khans would not put up with the Tudeh much longer. This avas obviously no' the .work of any of the khans and the town was much occupied in tracing the real author. Khavari, Seyyed Zia’s representative was at one moment reported to have admitted authorship but this was subsequently denied. The general conclusion reached is that the notices re the work of the Tudeh who got wind of a movement among the khans and wanted to scotah it. 27, Meanwhile the Qnshqni tribes v/ere nearing Shiraz during the ordinary course of their migration to the winter quarters and the local authorities got nervous that a 'coup' of some sort might be attempted. The Governor-General, the Army Commander and the Chief of Police came to the consulate and all declared their abhorrence of the Tudeh, their approval of British policy and their devotion t..» the true interests of Persia. They were at the same time clearly anxious to find out what the consulate knew. The Governor-General had an honorable record when he came to Shiraz the others ore 1 oest men who have been friendly with us for years. They may all have been sincere In their declarations to the consulate as in the tentative offers of help they made to Khosru' Qashqai but they have, none the less, been falling over one another to report to Tehran any move of Khosru’s and would, if thejr could, add- that British support was being given to the movement for autonomy for Pars* 28, Martial law was proclaimed in Shiraz on August 28 with a ten o’clock curfew and a prohibition on tho carrying o-r arms. 29, On August 27 Khosru Qashqai . r as summoned to Tehran. .After some initial hesitation when he feared he might be arrested he finally &amp;@ 6 ided that the Government would not dare arrest him and that he could reljr on his powers of persua sion to see him through. He s^t off characteristically at 8 p.n. to drive night and day without stopping until he reached the capital. •:0. Early in the month, before possibly he realized the scope the movement for autonomy would give to his talents. Khosru asked who the r His Majesty's Government venuld give various assurances. The chief were in connexion with propaganda and the supply of Arms and ammunition. With regard to propaganda he was told that the assistance of His Majesty’s Government was entirely unnecessary : they -could themselves do anything that was required. As for supplying nrkris and ammunition it was urged on Khosru that the autonomists should \ dismiss entirely the idea of achieving their aims by force of arms. He was also told, as he and others have been reminded repeatedly since, that His Majesty's Goverment would not support the movement for r i ]\it,/ of/ '•A*'' for autonomy and if, as they claimed matter to the United .fations, it was Majesty’s Government should not do 31. This consulate has criticized past and is certainly not ready now, undisclosed, to attempt a fresh reasons ^or his ascendancy over EXT 6749 , they profposed* to take 1 he to thr i, [interest that-His so . ; _ Khosru iashqai while his re-il in the still 1 seve rely aims may assessment of his character* But his three brothers, ten to twenty years older than he is, are beginning to appear: Khosru's brain is ' 7 /earer ^nd works several times faster than theirs and he is none the less a man of action. He is able to reach a decision quickly and it is noticeable that while his brothers talk he says wha- shc!m±d be - done. He falters in his stride occasionally - as when he received, the order to go to Tehran - but seems to make a good recovery. He is very astute in his dealings (he says he can he mad or sane as he ard and his handling of the Gnverno r-G-ene ral who made o Ter of help was very assured. To have convinced bis the union and at the same time, apparently, the Pr me sincerity, however he managed/and even if all are rot persuaded, is no mean feat for a man of 24 and one who chon ses.) him a v Tied associates in Minister of h: entirely has ha l only 'or intr rl are a very superficial education.

September P 546 [ /in ; The month hag seen the ,formati^n from among 'The ^varicnTs / tribal and town elements of the 'Fars National Ivlevement ; ' which September 30 had brought armed tribesmen to take Buehire, t© threaten Kazerun, t# invest Shiraz and to make formal demands of x the Government. 2 . In addition to the agreements they made with the Lors (i^ umassani and Boshmanziari) and the Arabs (Khamseh) (see diary ho. 8 paragraph^!) the Qashqai t^ok into their •onfidence the Bakhtiaris with the apparent |bject of - starting simultaneous action against Isfahan and Shiraz as a means of enforcing their demands* The plan was betrayed on the Bakhtiari side with the result that various arrests were made of Bakhtiari Khans and Ilhosru Qashqai was summoned to Isfahan to meet the Minister ©f Propaganda. Kh©sru, doubtless rightly, feared arrest and took advantage of a fall from a horse to plead indisposition and send his brother Mohammad Hossein Qashqai in his place. Mohammad Hossein had a long and stormy interview with the Minister ©f • Propaganda but as the latter had no documentary proof. &gt;f the com plicity of the Qashqai Mohammad Hossein was allowed to return to Shiraz after sending a telegram of loyalty, which the .Propaganda Department altered ror purposes of publication, to the rime Minister. 3. The betrayal .in Isfahan served to.confirm the Qashqai in their designs for the south and they gradually brought their forces nearer Shiraz until by the middle of the month the t*wn was surrounded. At the same time tribesmen advanced towards Kazerun .and Bushire. The effect of these moves was to deprive the tribal headquarters of its two most resolute members namelt Fathoilah- Haiat Baud and Khosra Qashqai. As events turned Haiat Baud was the only tribal leader to perform his contract o*? the nail by taking Bushire. Mhosru was sent to take Kazerun which had dtill not fallen by the end of the mon' h and the general control of the movement passed into the hands of Naser Qashqai. Naser is twenty /' oro ~/years older than Khosru and the eldest of the four Qashqai/and thers/ W ] ;lc ^] 1Gr f or this reason or because he knows his head would be the first to fall in the event of unsuccess he -adopted a tempo appro- machine is cumbrous and primitive and must take a considerable time to assemble and this may he one explanation of the' deliberate pace adopted by Naser. 4. Meanwhile Reza Hekpiat, Governor-General of Kerman, a for mer Shiraz deputy and a-i^iond of the Qashqai came to Shiraz on September 16 apparently with instructions from the Prime Minister to find a solution. He paid several visits to Naser accompanied by the Governor-General. : ? 5. By this* time the local Tudeh leaders and various T.udeh Government officials had fled from Shiraz and the Tudeh newspapers suspended publication. 6 . Finally Naser Qashqai sent an ultimatum (containing nine demands) to the Government and fixed sunset September 23 as the time limit for Government acceptance. The tribesmen were short of arms and, particularly, ammunition and to the uninformed .obser ver it seems that if they intended to take Shiraz by fore /thus/they threw away their best chance of success when they/abandoned the element of surprise. 7. In any case by the time Naser had got ^own o issuing his ultimatum the Army was not only awake to what was thro •.toning but had t.-ken steps to strengthen their position.

As herd Cramer saih, a people prefer bad rule under their own people to good rule under strangers. And the uarsis have seldom enjoyed good rule from Tehran. On the other hard the Prime Minister’s prestige has been maintained - he has been very astute - but he nerds to beware of the Qashqai, The present unholy alliance is motivated on the Qashqai side by a hatred of the Army 4 .n general and a strong personal dislike of Khorra Qai uqym for General Muini, together with an unfortunate contempt ^or the Shah., The Ple otiera• Faa a Ppiling commenced cm dune 23rd to elect the two deputies tor pasa.

After visiting Tehran Dr ft Afkham bikmat withdrew his candidature and received an appointment under the Minister Healths ./hen polling had finished the ejection was suddenly billed offo Accoraing to Khosru Qashqai, who may perhaps be sa^d to have his fingers on the pulse of the local situation - if a situation can be said to have a pulse — the Array is to blame. General Muini is again the villain of the piece and is accused oy khosru of interfering v/ith the Fasa elections at the instigation of the Shah, who, so the story goes, wished Sahib Divtani, the Queen Mother’s secretary, and Muhazzabl '*■ - 2 - o Muhozzab to be elected. Again, according to Rhosru, the people would h-nve jmt up v;ith electing Sahib Divanx r p«mil v services he is'pcp’ala/ly '^P^'ted to render to .the R - _ ‘. t ^ f but jibbed at Muhazzab. There i3 however much more reason to believe that the Pasa elections did not suit the Qnshqai book and that General Muini, having possibly been somewhat indxscreet is now being made the stalking-horse. Ibn Yusuf, who stood uns jcessfully for Shiraz, is now a candidate the new elections for Pasa and will have the support of the Qashqai. The i^ashqai second-string is Almuzegar. A sidelight on the Pasa elections is a statement Qashqai that until they were completed the Bushire could not take place, as the Prime Minister ”could two fronts at once' 11 .

General Muini id* 0 happened to be in Burazjan, only a few miles to the north, witr a strong military detachment, sent a punitive expedition and captured about a hundred prisoners, some hundred and thirty rifles and a quantity of ammunition. The prisoners were subsequently brought to Shiraz, Sheikh Abul Rasul, it appears, formerly ov/ned the villages in question and was ejected from them by Reza Shah who gave him lands in compensation in Azerbaijan. During the revolt in Azerbaijan he was turned out of his lands by the revolutionaries. With the help of the Qashqai he made his way back to hxs former hunting grounds. It is not uncommonly believed that General Muini has made a largish mountain out of a very insignificant molehill for reasons best known to himself. On or about June 9th three trucks laden with merchandise we*3 reported to have been looted on the road between Lar and Darab. 4) There is a story current locally that the Prime Minister is putting up Tadayyun, recently acquitted by the courts of charges of corruption and improper interference in the last elections, as Mejlis candidate for Bam in the Kerman district where the recently elected deputy has died. The story goes that if elected, Tadayyun’? job in the Mejlis will be to oppose Taqizadeh, the former Iranian Ambassador in London, /hose election for Azerbaijan is said to have displeased the Prime Minister. Whether or no there is anything in this story one thing is certain, and that is that Tadayyun’s acquittal is regarded in Shiraz as a huge joke, 5^ Malek Mansur Qashqai, the second of the four brothers, t/hd has been ij_l for several weeks in Firuzabad with e poisoned foot --'as last persuaded by Khosru to come into Shiraz for medical treatment.

With the end of the elections, reported in the last Diary, local political activity seems to have aied down and the scene has shifted to Tehran. On the fth July Faser Khan Qashqai resigned the seat in the i V h J he had been elected and the sixth candidate on the list, Sadrzadeh, thereupon took his place. This move was no unexpected and occasioned little surprise ana no comment locally. The questioning of Khosru qashqai s creaentials by the Mejlis also evoked little interest, beyond some speculation as to the amount it might have cost him to get them accepted^ ^ t* In Pasa the elections were cancelled and fusa Sarabandi, the Director of the Department of Justice in Shiraz, who had gone on leave to Tehran, was sent dovm to investigate 0 He returned to Tehran at the end and, according to rumour, his report on the conduct Of th Fasa elections runs into some 400 pages, Sarabandi ^-as acquired a Docal reputation for integrity so his report should make interesting, although possibly a little scabrous, readii&gt;tf.^ the very last da5f of the month the G-overnor-G-eneral, Pukn ul Mu Ik S^ri, was summoned to Tehran. It is still a matter for speculation whether this is because o_ toe F • elections, or whether it is connected with tribal affairs which are dealt with below. There is however, a strong rumour in Shiraz that the Dovernor-General is to be replaces. g.

IF General Huini does succeed in persuading the Qashqai to hand in their arms without bloodshed it will he a verv great personal triunph for him. Meanwhile although the rift between the Khans and Naser and Khosru seemn to he a reality, there is doubt that the Khans still fear the brothers, and it would appear unlikely that they will indeed surrender their arms until Faser and Khosru’s supporters have been disarmed. On Sunday, July 13th, at about 11a.m. 5 the Consulate received a telemione cull from uhe airfield — i c U'.s a long way to go yet before it can aspire to the designation of 'Airport' - from a Captain Stirling who said.he had .just landed a U a S 0 Army Dakota on an official mission., und could the Consulate feend out transport to bring' t: em into Suiraz. The truck was seiit to the airfield - some three miloa out of tbwn - and the entire compler ent of eight, which included at least a couple of lads on local leave, were entertained at the Consulate, whilst the senior officer enlightened H.IQConsul regarding the 'Official Mission'. The aircraft had flown from Algiers and came to Shiraz from Basra .The &gt;• object of the trip was to collect the bodies of U. S. service men buried in various parts of the Middle East for • re—interment in a IKS. j/ar Cemetery in Algiers or alternatively /for return- 2 - for return to the UoSo Signals to the capt-in.\o:f ohe aircraft from the U.S. Military Attacne in Tehran siid that pentission to land at Shiraz had been accorded and also that the—lie cess ary permission had been granted to disinter the remains of p. Radtke P an American sailor (who had come to Shiraz from Bushire in 1942 and who had been killed as the result of a fall from a horse) and xo take the remains aWay in ohe aircraft. The Consulate approached the loc/il Health Dept who said that they had no knowledge of the m atter, and coulo. not authorise any dis-internent in che circumstances with authority from Tehran. The Governor-General’s office, likewise, had no instructions. The American officer in charge of the operations had very little d- t- on which to proceed. The location of the body was unknown. The loc .1 Public Health anther it. ..a:, either had no records of the burial, or couldn't be bothered to look then up. The rmn h-d not been buried in the British Cemetery whic^anw -&lt; at the time, in the process of being removed., in accordance with new municipal regulations, to a newly-aequired plot o^ land outside the town limits. There seemed therefore nothing for the .Americana to do but to go to Dahran, their next port of call., and contact t-'e U.S. Einbassy in Tehran by signal. They left Shiraz on Bond y 14-th July. On Saturday 19th July they returned rraed -with a signal from the U.S. military Attache in Tehran saying that everything had been arranged and that they could come back to Shiraz and pick up the body. The Consulate had, during their absence tried to discover the -whereabouts of the body, which it was found s ad been buried in the armeni n cemetery. Identification of the grave was not made easier bv the fact that the stone which h d been erected had been stolen. Anyway, we now seemed to be making progress, but on visiting the Health Dep rtnent the American officer was -.gain info iy: that no instructions h d been received from Tehran. He there upon decided t&gt; remain behind in Shiraz whilst the aircraft nnd the rest of the p&lt; rty went up to Tehran, The following day the Health Dep-r tine at received, their instructions, and by the time the aircraft returned xhe remains mere ready to be put onboard. They left early the next morning. The officers were very grateful for all we had done; the ploy is that ith &amp; lictle warn.ng in advance we could hrve made all the preliminary enquiries -.nd ascertained that the loc .1 authorities had their instructions before the aircraft ./as sent, ..s it was, a job which tookabout 2 hours, wasted some four dayr and the Consulate truck covered. Vbout 40 miles tr nisporting the Americans to and frn xhe airfield and to and from the cemetery» The truck dr-'ver was, however, rewarded, with sin ration biscuitm nnd an old copy of the Saturday Evening post, 4, Sever'.1 ex-member' of the Tu.deh p\rty, namely J .wadi, Jtchtemai and Abdullah Afizi, have returned, to Shiraz.

The telegram stated t t the G vernment had allocated a tot? ; l of 70 million ri'-ls for public works in Pars including the building of dams at Kazerun and Dashti.
