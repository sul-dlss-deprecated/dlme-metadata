Track A! Buwail? Pass. Prominent Headland. resembling Negros head situate on right of road and looking south - as seen from bottom of Pass. Sketch map SHOWING MOTOR ROAD FROM KUWAIT TO RIYADH. Scale 1 : 500,000. KUWAIT-RIYADH MOTOR TRACK (1) Crossing of DA HAN A SANDS is approx: 69 K- M. by motor trash, and crossing is done in 7i hours- Sands are brick red in colour. (2) The two bad sand ridges or“ , ARAIG” are ARIQ SIRRU and ARIQ RUAICHIB. These haue dozens of tracks across them, made by driuers trying to find good ways across. A guide is necessary when crossing the sands for the first time. (3) A single prominent “Talha' Tree (Acacia) shows up on ARIQ IMR to guide the traveller. (4) Very good grazing exists all over DAHANA SANDS - “Arfaj” bushes lying thick predominate in southern half of sands. On northern edge the Arta dwarf tree grows thickly, and “Arfaj’’ grows thinner. (5) Other bushes and grasses appear to grow in profusion in spring, judging from many dry varieties found in October. (6) At RUM AH there are 5 wells, giving good water, at depth of 210. Wells are well revetted with stones. (7) For 10 miles S- W. of RUM AH WELLS surface of roadway is good, being gravelly. A fterwards and until bottom of BUWAIB PASS is reached, road passes through very stony country over which cars must move slowly. (Speed here 25 M- P- H.) (8) From bottom of BUWAIB PASS to RIYADH CITY road crosses a broad fiat plain which evidently gives trouble after rains, the surface being largely of clay- In October track is somewhat bumpy, due to deep old ruts, but improves the nearer one gets to RIYADH- Last 16 miles is very good, and high speeds can be maintained. (9) The motor track to HASS A branches off sharp to the right, immediately one crosses ARIQ HAM RAN I (going north). The KUWAIT track here is fainty marked so care is required otherwise one may miss it. (10) A ford V- S. car requires 9 tins (4 gall) of petrol for journey KUWAIT - RIYADH. (Three tins in tank and 6 tins in reserve). No petrol is available at JARIYA or RUM AH WELLS- Two skins of water (reserve) should be taken per car. (11) Ordinary travellers are held up at JARIYA POST till orders are received from RIYADH. Enquiry is made by wireless. (12) A ford V- 8- car well loaded up. will make RIYADH from KUWAIT in 17h running hours. (13) At RIYADH there are 2 wireless stations, a Post Office, a workable telephone system, a well equipped garrage and workshop capable of holding 160 cars. (14) The Royal Palace is electrically lit, power being obtained by a modern engine housed inside the town. (15) Kh: to denote a headland stands for “Khashm” = Nose - ditto Sh: stands for “Shaib' or water course. CORRECTION- Above diagram of BUWAIB PASS and immediately surrounding ^nt,y differs from Philbys map (sheet 9: War Office 1:5.000.000 1933) which makes ABU RUKHAIN headland extend southwards in a straight line to KHASHM AL AN, 28 miles away. The large re-entrant or bay between the ‘ARMA and BARMA Plateaus is not shown. Similarly no mention is made on same sheet of DHARAIYEH the laiqe and well preserved ancient capital of the WAHABIS, situate 15 miles N. W- of RIYADH. Both mistake and omission are doubtless due to errors in copying. 25 J24 48 49</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100025656284.0x000002_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/361, ff 10-13</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100025656284.0x000002</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/361, ff 10-13</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Sketch map showing Motor Road from Kuwait to Riyadh'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1938/1938</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-06-03T09:44:47</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 map (3 sheets)</extent><extent>Materials: 3 paper folios.Condition: the folios have tears and creases.Foliation: this item has a foliation number in the top right hand corner of each folio; the number is enclosed by a circle.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>'Sketch map showing Motor Road from Kuwait to Riyadh', on three sheets, prepared by Lieutenant Colonel Harold Richard Patrick Dickson, CIE Chief Local Representative of Kuwait Oil Company, Kuwait.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100025656284.0x000002#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
