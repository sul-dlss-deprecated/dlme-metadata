Major iludson, Assistant lolitical Agent, Bahrain* Mr# M*A* Hafiz, Judicial Assistant to the Political, discussed the suggestion that the percentage to be charged as rent should be raised from the existing rate of 4^ on the value of the property* since the Law of Bents and Leases came into force two years ago was far higher than their actual value as fpr sone ten years previously rents had risen progressively, without check* He contended that any question of a further rise in the rent would therefore be inequitable* It would, he'added also, result in a rush for reassessment, which would result in houses being assessed at very much more than theii^ actual value. He was supported by Mr. ialvi. not unreasonable if the repairs were carried out by the Land lord and if the property was reassessed exoJLuetvfc of the value of the site* The other members then stated 4t once that proper repairs by landlords were not and never had in fact been carried out* They agreed that assessment should be exclusive of the value of the site* \ t iat a rise from 4* to 6^ on the rent would in effect be a 60# rise and that a lessee now paying #s*60/- for a house would pay Rs*90/-* This they consider d would be too great a rise and in the present days of high cost of living would only accentuate the tendency to increased inflation and a resultant demand in increased wages. he no increase In the percentage of rent chargeable* They would only be willing to consider a rise if properties were reassessed excluding the v&amp;lue of the site. 3. The romnittee then discussed the addition of the words “with the agreement of the landlord” in clause 10 (a) of the feg ilation. The unanimous opinion was that the words should not be added as they nullify completely the right of the lessee to renew a lease, which was the sole point of this clause* If the words suggested were introd cod there would be noth ng to prevent landlords disagreeing to a lessee renewing the lease after one year and turning him out. T e Committee were of the opinion that the rights of landlords were adequately covered by Section 8 of the Law of i ents and Leases. Agent, Bahrain. A.

This the Committee considered, was not 'sublettinj legislation as it was considered that by major or minor repairs the landlord only maintains tie house. Members further stated that in act al practice it was very seldom that repairs were ever carried out by the landlords and it generally fell on the tenants to carry out necessary repairs themselves. 6. The Committee recommend that th^re should be at leasts two representatives of the tenants in the Assessment Committee as it is not at all repr&gt; sentative of tenants, all the members being either landlords themselves or employees of the Bahrain Government.

Hickinbothami O.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain. To The Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain. Sir 1 have the honour to suggest that the Bahrain Government should consider seriously the introduction of rent control with a view to checking the very considerable and disproportionate increases in the rents of local dwelling houses. I suggest for the consideration of the Bahrain Government that they might assess the rents of houses at the same figure as they have already been assessed for purposes of municipal tax. 2. At the same time as rent control is introduced, it will be necessary, in order to ensure that the orders are not circumvented, to promulgate an order making it Illegal for landlords to evict tenants except for failure to pay their rents or when the landlord himself genuinely desires to occupy his own premises. The Bahrain Government may be interested to know that it was found necessary some months ago to Introduce rent control in4* India and also, so I am informed by the Hon*ble the Political Kesident, in^ty Persia. I have the honour to be, Sir. Your most obedient servant Political Agent, Bahrain.♦ ■'i No. 2 / — ¥ of 1562 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated, Dulqaada 11, 1362 November 9, 1943. C. Dalrymple Belgrave, Jlsquire, C.B.13., Adviser to the Governme nt of Bahrain Bahrain. 1 ^ Kis Britannic Majesty’s Pol it Bahrai n. gent, Sir , y P&gt; I have the honour to refer to your letter No. C/1431 dated 29th October 1943, regarding rent control. I have discussed the matter with His Highness Shaikh Salman as no general action could be taken without his approval. His Highness is averse to making a new assessment of house rents in Manama and Moharraq and he does not consider that the existing municipal house tax would afford a sound basis upon which to assess future rents. I suggested to His Highness that failing a new assessment measures could be taken to prevent sudden demands for higher rents being made by landlords. His Highness was willing to consider some such measure. I submit vbtesfc the following suggestion, which I have not discussed in details with His Highness:- 1. Written leases should be compulsory and should contain all conditions such as responsibility for repairs both major and minor . 2. A lease concluded between a landlord and tenant on a a monthly basis should not be liable a change in the monthly rent for a period of 12 months from the date on which the lease was signed. The tenant should have the option of vacating the premises at any time during the 12 months provided that due notice is given by him to the landlord. The period of notice should be one month or 15 days, whatever period seems reason able. It might be desirable, if this rule were introduced,to make the rule retrospective to one month before publi cation of the order. 3. I suggest that the owner of a house should not be entitled to raise the rent of a house more than a definite percentage of the former rent when leasing to a new tenant unless he can show that he has incurred additional expen diture on the building between the expiration of the original lease and the commencement of the new lease. The percentage of increase might be in the neighbourhood of lO^to 15/o. 4. I have no copies of rent control legislation of other countries, if the rules which are applied in India, Iraq or Iran could be obtained they would be of assistance in draw ing up rules in Balmain. 5. I suggest that for the present any legislation should apply only to premises let as dwelling houses. I have heard no complaints regarding shops or other properties. 6 . Before submitting definite proposals to His Highness I should be obliged if you would comment on my suggestions. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Adviser to the Government.My dear Knight, Me are seriously thinking of intro ducing some form of rent control hare. I believe that rent control is already in existence in Basra and Baghdad. Would it be possible for you to let me have a copy of the Iraqi Order?

It appears that the tenant has been occupying the house without any lease, though it would seem reasonable to suppose that when he accepted an enhanced rent some definite agreement was made for the future. At present there is no legislation to afford tie tenant any redress. I personally consider that if an educated man hires a house without any form of agreement depending possibly on some vague verbal understanding he lays himself open to the type of profiteering which he complains about in his petition.

Trikumdas) is insisting on me for an unreasonably higher rent under threats of getting the place vacated. (2) We are already paying Rs.400/- per annum and any further increase over this amount will be honestly out of proportion with my income as also with the size of the shop which is 20’ x 10’ only. (3) We have continuously occupied the shop for the last 8 years and have always been regular in payments of the rentals. (4) The original rent was fixed © Rs.loO/- per annum which fact alone would be enough to explain the ever-increasing greed of the said Landlord. (5) He now demands Rs.600/- per annum for the same shop and is not willing to make any consideration whatever, thinking that he would be able to extract this amount from us since it would be difficult, if not impossible, for us to vacate the premises where we have 8 years standing and acquaintance with our customers. 7 &gt; 1 * &gt; I humbly pray to your goodself for intervention and protection.

HOUSE RENTS - MANAMA Dear Sir, Enclosed herewith is copy of a letter received from K.I Natarajan as Secretary of The Bapco 'CT M Employees Bepresentative Body, on the above subject and requesting that an adjustment be made in the Living Allowance of Bs.35/- at present being paid by the Com pany, due to the increased cost of house rents in Manama. This pay ment is made by the Company as a Housing Allowance and not as a Living Allowance. Indian employees who have received demands for increased rents or notices to vacate the houses occupied by them. ing notices on their tenants on the grounds that they require the houses for their own use, whereas it is nothing more than a move to obtain greatly increased rents. Under the 'Rules of Rents and Leases” set forth in the Notice of the Bahrein G-ovemment of January 2, 1944, a Landlord is of course entitled to request a tenant to vacate the house if it is required for the Landlord's own occupation, even though the house is probably only occupied for a short period before being re-let to another tenant at a greatly increased rent. This naturally gets over Clause 2 of the Regulations which stipulates that a Landlord cann6t increase the rent of a tenant remaining in a leased house by more than 1($. It is my understanding that the Regulations above referred to were framed to obviate any abnormal rise in rents but it seems that as Landlords are finding loopholes in the existing Regulations, some revision of the Regulations may be necessary to achieve their intent. We are therefore bringing this matter to your attention in the event you may wish to give some consideration to such a revision. consider granting an increased Housing Allowance to compensate employ ees for the increased rents they are being forced to pay and we would appreciate receiving from you an expression of opinion as to what would be an equitable figure for Manama house rents on which to base any con templated action in this respect.

Lear Sir, Bahrein, April 30, 1944. 7/e refer you to correspondence ending with your letter of the 29 th January, 1944. If the housing situation was had when first we wrote you on the subject, it is now worse and beyond control. 7/e therefore feel anxious about its serious conseouences if necessary steps are not taken immediately. No houses are available in Manama - we wish to emphasize that. TJLere as there was difficulty in getting houses before, at the moment it is impossible to get a house. Such houses as are occupied by our people are pathetically overcrowded, and with the advent of summer, the situation becomes all the worse and it can be well imagined rather than explained the precarious plight which will arise during the sweating months ahead. You will agree that the situation is bad; but we regret it is further aggravated by landlords giving notices to present tenants on one pretext or the other, and increasing the rents to incredible figures where houses have been vacated by employees leaving the Island. The following few instances are given to throw some light_on the subject and also the show how the loopholes in the Government Bent Regulations are being exploited House Occupied by &amp; vacated during the last few days Lr.

In these circumstances it is regretted that we must ask you to relieve us immediately of the responsibility placed on us for the sum of 5 .35/- in the way of Living Allowance and that this responsibility be taken over by the Jompany's orgainzation. You will appreciate that we have not troubled you all these years and have been carrying on as best as we could, but we feel the present situation is entirely beyond ^•us • Your early attention in this direction shall be greatly appreciated.

Bear Sir, Since my arrival here from leave, I had Been in look out for a house in Manama. At present I am putting up in a house in the name of Mr. -Abdul Jabber who is on leave and expected at any moment. Sometime in January I had arranged with Mr. Yousuf bin I/.oayed owner of the house occupied by Mr. A. Kamid, of Commissary, who is now proceeding on leave, that the house when vacant be given to me. ^ Under the arrangements made in presence'of Mr. Kamid, owner and myself that I should have the house when vacated, the rent was pointed out^ to be 3.30/ per month as paid by Mr. Hamid. I had also written to Mr. Abdul Jaboar of these arrangements. I had been yesterday to Mr. Yousuf bin Moayed the owner of the house to pay the rent in advance and register the house in my name, but the owner denied the previous arrangements a^f said that the rent of the house would be Is.60/- per month if I wished to Lave. Under these circ'imstances and since I cannot afford to pay the rent of &gt;s.60/- per month, for a house having only two rooms, I request the Company to assist me in getting a house at the rent within my allowances and/or please contect the owner, to rent me the house at same rate, as paid by Mr. Hamid, since I do not find another house available at present. I also confirm that I had been arranging to even shift my quarters to Maharraq Island, in view of the fact that Mr. Hamid’s sailing prior to Mr. Jabbar’s arrival was uncertain and in view of this I had mentioned to my Superior to arrange for my transportation from Ma^arraq to Manama in order to connect me to buss for xlefinery, subsequently, sailing /“V was assured this week. I regret to trouble you in the matter, but sincerely hope that I will get all possible assistance from the Company to house me in someway. Yours faithfully, SGB.

DPTWEILSE ) Dear Sir, I Peg to forward the following few favourable consideration. facts for your kind and Due to the non-availability of houses in Manama, since my return from leave in July 1943, I have been putting up with Mr.Eahmutallah, of Stores Department, who had taken up a house on verbal ’understanding with the landlord, Abdul Wahab by name. However, since the issuance of the Rent Regulations Act by the Government of Bahrein, we approached the landlord for a lease, which he refused to sign. To make matters still worse, he tolc us to vacate the house so that he could shift himself there order to effect repairs to the house which he is now occupying. v To the best of my knowledge, his house does not need any repairs, but the above is merely a pretext to have us vacate the house to lease it on higher rent). He looked everywhere for a house without any success. Meanwhile, since the departure of Mr. Rahmatullah on leave on 22nd of the last month, the owner of'the house has been threatening me to vacate the house, failing which he would take legal actions against me. Pearing this trouble, with greatest difficulty, I have located a house, which has just fallen vacant. It was previously occupied by the Agency headclerk, who was paying s.25/- per month. The owners'of this house are minors and therefore their interest are managed by the G-overnment of Bahrein, w T ho are now demanding rvsSO/- per month and I am compelled to take up this house at least xor a mono! * tor your information, this house consists of barely two rooms and is on the 3rd floor of the building. I am bringing this matter to your attention in an endeavour that you might do something to stop this abnormal rise in rents now ruling in Manama. I am sure that this particular incident could be placed before His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, who, I feel confident, will see that the profiteering landlords do not defy his orders. The landlords are ^in an epidemic craze to-day in their demands in whatever rents oiiey aesiie or in their attitude towards their tenants. enough to take necessary steps in order to lessen our troubles otherwise I do not see any other alternative than to submit the rental bill to tne Company regularly as Company should either provide me with suitable quarters or pay adequate Housing Allowance to meet the monoiiiy house ren baladyia, water, electricity, etc. at the present time, and trust that necessary action will be taken immed iately to redress our troubles.

I enclose for your information an amended regulation which I hope will shortly be published by the Bahrain Government and which should stop the known loop-holes though I have little doubt it will only be a matter of time before the landlords find some other way of escaping from their obligations to their tenants and the general public. There are several cases at present in the court in which landlords have applied for evic tion orders against their tenants. I cannot forecast how the cases will be decided but I feel sure that the Sub-Judge who is dealing with them will be most careful to see that justice is done. If by any chance the cases are given against the land lords thff^ will probably not be very much rent trouble for several months to come. 3. I find it very difficult to answer the question in the last paragraph of your letter. The cost of renting accommo- „ datioh in Manama must depend to a great extent on the class and qwpifrfrty which the employees of your company consider in keeping with their dignity and the magnitude of their families. I am inclined to think that if you do make any increase it should not be more than P^.10/- a month and any further demand for in crease should be most strongly resisted. 4. The tenants themselves can do a great deal towards stabi lising rents by insisting on written agreements and by being sufficiently public spirited to file cases against land-lords who have supervened the regulations. Dr. Siddiq will be willing to advise any of your employees on the legal aspect of their position and should this in any way c*lash with his work as a civil judge I will make arrangements for cases in which he has expressed an opinion to be dealt with by the Assistant Political Agent.

Dear Sir, * I enclose herewith a translated copy of a notice issued to me by my landlord which is self-explanatory. The house in question was rented by me in June 1943 at Rs*35/-» per month which was increased by him to Rs.40/- from February 1944. On April 1st he informed me that he had an offer of Rs.60/- p.m. for his house and if I would vacate, he promised to give me Rs.50/- n Bakshees w which, of course, I flatly refused. Again on the 15th June the landlord verbally Informed me that he wants the house for his personal use as his family is falling sick often due to inadequate ventilation in his present house. I informed him that I will search for a house. During the conversation, in presence of some of my friends he flattered me by saying that I am his best term ant giving no room for any complaint from any of the neighbours with a view to get the house vacated by his flattery. Yesterday evening the attached notice was given to roe personally and at the same time he wrote to the Govt. Electricity Dept, to the effect that I am vacating the house at my own accord and the fuse may be removed at once. The landlord has no right whatsoever to ask the Electricity Dept., to cut off the energy as I am meeting their bill readily as and when presented, besides which I have a deposit of Rs.10/- with them according to the Regulation. When I took over the house last year he promised to effect necessary repairs to the doors and windows and also to whitewash, which he never did. When I approached him on this point several times he told me that I will have to make the necessary repairs if I want to live decent. This house consists of one room on the top and one below which is not fit to live in, on account of dampness. The kitchen is in a dilapidated condition. The foregoing is passed on to you for your information and protection if he files a suit against me on expiry of 15 days as stated in his notice. Thanking you in anticipation, Yours faithfully, K.

Memorandum: - With reference to the ’’Lav; of Rents and Leases” which has been issued by you and by the Bahrain Govern ment, I understand that there is some doubt among the public as to the working of the 10^ increase in rents. It is not understood whether an additional 10$ may be charged at the expiration of every year’s lease or if it can only be charged once. It appears to me that an additional 10$ can be charged after completion of one year’s tenancy and again on completion of a second year’s tenancy. Is this your view of the meaning of the law ? ' Adviser to the Government.Rent increases \ &amp; 1) Under S.2, if the lease is on a monthly basis, rent 'shall not be increased until after 12 months from the date from which the lease takes effect and the increase shall not be more than 10* M This implies that a) Rent may be increased by 10% after 12 months from date of commencement of lease. b) If contractual period is for less than 12 months, a new lease may be increased by 10% on the previous rate. To prevent lessors insisting on a short term contractual period e.g. 3 or 6 months, S.6 enables a lessee to renew the lease when presumably an increase would nbt be justified as a renewed be lease would not/held to be a new lease* 2) Tenants on a yearly basis are liable to an increase at the end of 12 months vide S.8. 3) I suggest an order is required stating that 'it shall not be permissible to increase rents above those extant on - say - the 1st Moharram 1364 except in accordance with an 'Alan issued by the Bahrain Government or unless the lessor can prove to the / court reason for an increase such as additional expenditure etc.' This would be in line with the Iraqi order on P.10 (see * ' portion marked A). &gt; • 4) The present order on P.66 would however require amendment and if you agree I will draft* A.P.ANo. 7$'^ -6/82, Political Agency, Bahrain, 24th February 1945. n To The Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain. e) MKMOR-iNDUM ( ■ V Reference your memorandum No.466-36 dated the 18th i Februar r 1945. 2.

Political Agent, Bahrain. Copy for information to the Indian Assistant, BahrainManama, ^ Bahrain, 26th March 1945. Sir, The Undersigned people have the honour to bring to your notice that according to the order No.35 issued in the year 1363 A.H. by The Government of Bahrain, the lend-lords oan not increase the rent of their Shops or their Houses more than 10$ and they can not send out their tenants unless they really need their houses or their shop for themselves. Some of the proprietors, being unable to R .increase the rent more than the legal limitationi, thought of a tuck by which they claim their shops or houses not for rent, but for themselves. It is quite evident that the shop being once KSKacksd evacuated can be hired by a much higher rent by others. As you already know each and/all the tenants oWe having their shops and houses for a goods ntimber of years during which they have .established their work and trade to earn their living. To evacuate their placets only means that they must throw their goods in the market due to the fact that even a very tiny shop^ in the remotest point of Manama is almost impossible to be got. The persons who have started this affair are Ibrahim and Hussain the sons of *liamadij The former having asked Bin Shfcikh to leave his shop and the la'ffer from Shaikh Mustafabin Abdullatif. They in their turn will be obliged to ask their own tenants to evacuate their shops for their own use. The two above mentioned persons have grocery shops and the main market is not at all a proper place for such trade. This shows quite cleanly that they do not need their shops for themselves as they claim, but they want to play a legal trick supported by the latter part of the order No.33• We are sure that you are very well aware of the. difficulties that such action will create in this Island.

Memorandum: - I have received a petition from a number of leading householders comp fining that tenants ere in the habit of sub-letting the premises which they have hired very often at a considerable higher rent than that agreed upon between the landlord and the tenant. 2. The ’’Rules of Rents and Leases” issued in Blan No. 2 of 1363 concerns the transactions between the owner of the house and his tenant and there is no mention of sub-letting. It has not in the past been customary in Bahrain to include any clause in leases regarding tenants rights to sub-let properties and it has in fact been generally accepted in the past that any tenant may sub-let a property without reference to the landlord. In addition to receiving a petition on this subject I have been consulted by the Awkaf Departments and the Minors Department all of whom administer considerable house property in Manama. I recommended them to insert a clause in all future leases to the effect that the property sho ..Id not be sub-let without the permission of the landlord, but as most of the leases have a long time to run this advice was not considered very helpful. 3. Would you be prepared to consider an additional clause to these rules, which are themselves a war time measure, to the effect that no property may be sub-let without the permission of the landlord ? The position as regards a large proportion of the houses to which this order applies to is that they belong to Bahrain subjects but are let to foreigners. 4. The sub-letting of houses by the tenants at high rents does not actually harm the landlords but because they are restricted themselves from raising the rents they naturally resent seeing their houses sub-let for much higher rents than they are allowed to charge.

I am an employ of the Imperial Bank of Ijran, Bahrain. Vvhen I arrived from India in November T 44, there was much difficulty in finding some accommodation and as our bank was not under obligation to provide me with quarters^ I put up temporarily with a friend. The place was not quite suitable for habitation, and it* became imperative to shift from there in the' middle of June f 45. It is commonly known that there are several single-room tenements in the Hilal Building and as our bank is also housed in the same building I thought it would be a convenient place for me to live while alone. All the rooms (7 each) in thevfasTern and Western v/ings (parallel to the custom wharf) of the building are similar and the rent ranged from Rs. 5/ to Rs. 10// p.m. Even now some are paying Rs. 7 and some others Rs. 10/- When I knew that one of the rooms were falling vacant, I approached the agent Mr. Khaled Sadoon through our office interpreter who deals with our local matters. The agent demanded Rs. 18/ p.m. and I declined as the rent for that room was only Rs.10 until the previous night. But later when I had to shift from my temporary abode I approached the said agent in a similar way and he offered me one of these rooms with the addition a light point for Rs. 35/ p.m. H oping that the agent would relent to reason when he see the absurdity of charging such an abnormal rent for a room worth only Rs. 10 , I occupied it on the 19th June. After friendly talk and argument with the agent in the B ank office, our interpreter informed me that the agent was relentless. In the meantime another room in the same flat washracant and I asked the agent to give me that, instead of the one for wnich he demanded such a high rent. Now this room which became vacant was by three rooms apart from that of mine and was without light fitting. The occupant Mr. Abdul Jalil of M/s. Petrol€um Concessions Ltd., was paying at Rs? &amp; lately at Rs. 10/ p.m. until the last week of J une f 4o. I expected a similar charge or with an appreciation of 10 $ . The agent demanded Rs. 25/- p.m. for this and was quite persistant on it. I paid the amount demanded inorder to have a place to stay and then to represent the position to the authorities so that an assessment may be made according to law. Mr. Abdul Jalil would witness as to what rent he was paying for the same room until the previous week. The agent appropriated the amount I paid towards the rent of the other room I occupied for 12 days at Rs. 35p.m. and the balance for the new room* even though I told him that I would settle the rent of the other separately. He declined to issue a receipt x on the plea that he does not issue receipts for part of the month. I now enclose a receipt marked ! A T issued to me for the current Arabic month at Rs. 25/ p.m. Another receipt marked T B f for the previous month at Rs. 10 for an adjoining room is also enclosed for perusal. n m n. Jl trust the foregoing is sufficient to show the amount of injustice and unfairness in the deal.' The room I occupy is hardly spacious for one man to move about and I am not in a position to pay Rs. 25 for, game. The agent has been taking advantage of the present situation OX aaortage in accommodation and goinging on increasing the rent qui^e unchecked. • For the same reason one o^two Bapco employees had paid as much as Rs. 18 p.m. for rooms in the 5 s2£'flats and was reluctant to make any representation on account of their receiving nearly three times the amount by way of house allowance. 1 do not get any houSH* allowance, and the amount charged to me is quite abnormal and unprecedfented. I shall be willing to pay what the authorities think as a fair assessment for the room. • y»ikJ ^JL JLl’T j. iV*j. J i. XAiC J Awaiting your kind orders. I beg to remain, Sir, Your opediepit servant.

This allows for a 10% increase in rents after each year. I understand that both landlords and tenants are now dissatisfied, landlords because the war has ceased yet this legislation continues and they have not full control of their properties and tenants because of the increasing rent allowed by the annual 10% rise. perhaps you would consider the question of making some change in this regulation or abolishing some clauses of it. I consider that under all conditions written leases should be^ insisted upon. I think only one case has been made in the Bahru n Courts'under this regulation. Adviser to the Government.No.4039-6/82.

My dear Smith, As promised in my conversation this morning with His Highness, yourself, and Shaikh Abdullah, I am writing to you about the formation of a Committee to go into the question of the rents charged for houses and living accommodation in Bahrain and the law relating thereto. 2* I gathered from His Highness that the chief question which concerned him was that in the case of landlords who had leased out their house property for fairly lengthy periods - five years was the period quoted the present Bahrain Law allowed them an increase of only 10 per cent in the rent at the termination of the lease; while those who had let their property on yearly or monthly leases were enabled to get the advantage of the 10 per cent increase at the end of each year. His Highness has made the point several times that he did not want on the one hand complete freedom given to the house owners, but on the other hand, he thought they should in some cases, at any rate, be entitled to raise their rents to a greater extent than is allowed under the existing law. 3. I suggest that the terns of reference of the Committee be something like - 'To examine the rents charged for house property in Bahrain and the law relating thereto and to suggest any modifications that may be required in the latter'. 4. I suggested that cbe Committee should have four members viz. a representative from the Agency, from the Bahrain Government, of the house-owners, and of the tenants. I shall appoint Bird to act for the Agency and shall be glad to hear from you the name of the Bahrain Government representative. ?ith regard to the other two members, since most of the landlords are Bahrain subjects, and very large number of the tenants likely to be affected are British subjects, the most practical arrangement would seem to be that the Bahrain Government should appoint the former and the Agency the latter. I can see no objection to this except the rather academic one that the two Govern mental agencies would seem to be identifying themselves with the parties directly interested in the question at issue. But if you have no objection, I think this arrange ment will do. Kindly Idt me know. I ► Yours sincerely, G.W.R. Smith, Esq., Acting Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain. / /D.O.No. VI Balaam Rece pt &gt; Xt-^i. &amp;* IC&gt; - - J^o^7.^....-D‘i‘'e... ~ Adviserate, October 6, 1945.

I think a sub-committee of about nine merchants sho^ild be formed and asked to give their opinion on the question of rents of shops and amaras before deciding whether the present or a future lav should apply to them. 3. Regarding w muqawila n and house rents, the committee’s recommendations, if accepted, would involve the assessment of house property through out Manama and Muharraq which, though it mi£ht be desirable, would be a considerable undertaking. I do not agree that the Rent Committee should function as a permanent institution through whom applications for the assessing of rents should be passed and in which the final decision should vest.

He regards these regulations as a war time measure which he agreed to during the war but would like to see discontinued now that the w^r has ended. His Highness is not prepared to give his assent to the recommendations of the committee. He considers that some of the members are not representative of the landlords and tenants who they are supposed to represent.

I included one other member, Haj Mansoor al Arayedh, A Shia Bahrani, I thinic it is desirable that a Bahrani should be included in the list, Haj Mansoor is a large land- owner and a man of intelligence. The replies to the questions were briefly as enclosed herewith. Lt. Colonel A.C. Galloway, O.B.E., H. B. M f s Political Agent, Bahrain. Bahrain Receipt1 A REPLIES. Rents should be based on 12-^ years. (This works out at interest on capital at the rate of 8$ which appears to me to be high. I believe in India - 4% is usual interest on house property). Valuation of property should be based on existing values not pre-war values. A committee should be appointed to assess pro perty values. 2. No, this is replied in answer 1. Existing leases which have not expired should not be affected by any new rule till expiration of lease agreement. i5. Yes. 4. It is unnessary to fix the number of occupants of a house but the tenant shall not contract with a sub-tenant or allow additional people to occupy the house for the purpose of his own advantage without permission from the landlord and this pemission shall not be unreasonably withheld. 5. The parties should abide by the terms of the lease but if a tenant knows that he may be transferred suddenly from Bahrain, or sent away, he should add a clause in the lease that in such an event the lease can be terminated without due notice. 6. The increase of 100 per annum should be applicable till clause (1) comes into effect. It is unneces sary for a committee to go into the question of rents every year unless a landlord demands an increase. 7. Arabic year, unless specifically stated in the Agreement. 8. The landlord should retain the right to demand vacation of the house if he needs it for his own occupation or for occupation by a member of his family. The responsibility for finding another residence rests with the tenant. The landlord should have no right to eject one tenant in order to substitute him for another tenant unless there are reasonable grounds for ejecting the original tenant. 9. Yes, but the public should be given full warning and ample time to become acquainted with this regulation. 10. Replyr 6 covers this. j S.Z.No.761-6/82. Political Agency, Bahrain, The 6th March, 1946.

H. B. M T s Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum: - jn V/ith reference to your memorandum No. ldr§7-6/82 dated 14th April 1946, enclosing the draft 'Law of Rents and Leases', I have the following comments Regulation 1 . I suggest that leases should be written upon Government paper as is used for sennads etc. Regulation 2 . Who is responsible for the lease being drawn up, lessor or lessee? His Highness considers that the tenant should be responsible, I think the landlord should be responsible. Regulation 3 . The Bahrain Government is mostly concerned with landlords, as the majority of these are Bahrain subjects, the tenants are mostly foreigners, many of them being Indian clerks employed locally in commercial houses. I consider however that rents based upon the recovery of the capital expenditure on the house in 12^ years, which is 8% interest, is exceedingly high. Presumably the value of the site not only the cost of the building will be taken into consideration. Working upon the system of recovery of capital cost of the house, not including the land, in 12^ years the following would be the increased rentals of certain properties belonging to His Highness or the Bahrain Government whose capital cost is exactly known.

Political Agency, Bahrain, The 27th May, 1946. To The Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain. Memorandum . Reference your letter No.839-36 dated the 24th April, 1946, containing comments on the draft Law of Rents and Leases. 2. Section 1. It is understood that there is already an Alan in existence which stipulates that all documents executed by Bahrain subjects must be written on Bahrain Government paper. In the absence however, of the application of the Indian Stamp Act to Bahrain, it is not possible to make it obligatory for persons subject to the Bahrain Order- in-Council to use this stamped paper, though it is understood that in practice they usually do so. 3. Section 2. It Is agreed that the landlord should be responsible for the lease being drawn up. 4. Section 3. It is agreed that interest at 8# is far too high, and the rent figure has now been based on the recovery of the capital cost, excluding the value of the site, in 20 years, i.e., to a return on the capital of interest at 5$. This figure is still high, but in fixing it allowances have been made for the fact that it is impracticable to include in the capital cost the value of the site. Five per cent is of course, a maximum figure, and there is no reason why landlords should not lease their houses at lower rents should in certain circumstances they consider this to be desirable or necessary. 5* An assessment committee of seven would perhaps be somewhat unwieldy, and find difficulty in meeting together as frequently as it will need to do. Only one member from each Municipality instead of two, has therefore been included. 6. I enclose a fresh draft, embodying the latest amendments, and, would be grateful if it can be published as soon as possible, so that the Rent Assessment Committee can start on their labours without delay. olitical Agent, Bahrain./ THE LAW OF RKNT3 AND LEASES , The Rents and Leases Regulation No. 29/1363 dated the 19th Raj&amp;b, 1363 (9th July, 1944) is hereby repealed and the following Regulation substituted the ref on - 1.

Memorandum:- a lira in Receipt With reference to your letter iTo:l^§8-6/82 of the 27th May,1946. 1 am sorry that there is so much delay over getting the matter settled. On receipt of your memorandum I prepared an Arabic draft of the Law for submission to His Highness. His Highness after examining it carefully decided that it was necessary for him again to discuss the matter with some of the leading landlords. He therefore gave them the AUan to study and summoned a meeting of landlords last week at which he and Sh.Abdullah bin isa and myself were present. The whole matter was again discussed and the following comments were made, which His Highness asked me to forward to you at the same time saying that if you wished to talk over the matter with him again he would be pleased to discuss the matter. Section Ho:l and No:2 . Agreed. Section No:3. Kent should be 6% of capital outlay that is building and site^not 5% of the cost of building only. Rents should be agreed between lessor and lessee and only in the event of a dispute should the rent De calculated at 6% , the 6% should be assessed on the existing market value of the house which should be determined by assessment committee. $ &gt; Section No:4 and No:5. if section No:3 is adopted these sections will not be necessary. J . Section No:6. There shpuld be two members from each municipal council instead of one. m the case of houses in Manamah the Manamah members should be called in and Muharraq members for property in Muharraq. The landlords stated that they could not assess values in the towns in which they do not reside. &lt;?. /s - © * mmSection Mos: 7 and 8. Agreed up to ^d) (.i;, suggest addition to (d) (ii) as follows:- *»' v s* (e) If the lessor wishes to rebuild his house, provided that he does not re-let the house before the building is completed and that he offers the house,on completion of building, to the original lessee • be less than one month”. Add to 9, ’’in case the lessor has received payment in advance he shall refund the balance due to the lessee or allow the lessee to sub-let the house. nouses' the words 'and flats' also add after 'shops' the words 'Khans'. 12. Agreed. suggestion that 6% should be allowed is merely a 'try on', it is fa going to difficult to assess the value of houses built before the war and if it were possible to make no distinction between new and old houses but to rate them all at what they are worth to-day the assessment would be very much easier and i believe it would result in an obligatory lowering of rents. To-day many buildings, some of them new , are producing rents which represent 15% and even more of the capital outlay on the building, i think there is no objection to the suggestion in section 6,7,8,9 and 11. The objection to specified maximum punishments is an old one in Bahrain, the public appears to prefer the court to. have unlimited power rather than a suggestion that the court might impose a maximum sentence.

All the members objected to a specified maximum term of - imprisonment and amount of fine and suggested wording as follows:- l*i „ 'Defaulter liable to pay a fine or to undergo imprisonment as shall be ordered by the court'. / J . 3.

Reference your memorandum No.464/12 dated the 15th June, 1946. the maximum permissible rent must be laid down, for if the amount of rent payable is left entirely to the lessor and lessee to decide privately an unscrupulous landlord will, in these days of housing shortage, find little difficulty rent. For similar reasons it has been thought advisable to retain Sections 4 and 5 as they stand. and not six per cent as suggested by the landlords, but on the other hand you will notice that it is now agreed that all buildings should be assessed on their present day value which is to include the value of the site. These last two concess ions are very much in the landlords* favour, and in the circumstances it is hoped that you will now find it possible to have the Regulation published in its present form without any further alterations. 2 . I enclose herewith duplicate copies of a revised draft which incorporates most of the suggestions made in your letter. 3.

T»L I have the honour to place the following statement for your favour of perusal and necessary assistance in the needful which shall benefit all the concerned in Bahrain. ihe lease of the small store at present occupied by me opposote lias tern Panic Ltd will empire on 31st October 1946. Ihe premises belongs to one Persian by name k• 3 usheri• iiarly this month the landlord served me witn a notice to vacate shop as ne wanted for nis own purpose (as stated in the notice). But he sent me verbal message through Abdul Karim tail or (opposite to Jashanmal* s store) that if X would agree to pay the rent Ls 1500/'•* per year in place of As 500 /- as leased for the year I may remain away in the premises. I sent him the reply tnat his offer was very- unreasonable and that he should reconsider over it. But ^bdul Karim aid not turn up to me again and on enquery replied that i shoulu see^ the landlord personally dc discuss with him. I then sent another w person by name Ohaimrbhuj broker to talk with tne lanaloru but he informed that the landlord would not change his offer • Ihe condition of one shop is such tnat with slight push trie doors will fall out (which any time could be seen) and many a times these have fallen down by hign wind which x had to get refixed &amp; repaireu/ at my own expences as the landlord refused to do from his pocket, lae floor in the shop is broken at certain places which I have noj/ touched so far and the landlord also declined to ao any necessary repairs, -^s I waa. and am on look out for sane other store i did n II kb to spend my money on bhe repairs which is not my property. Unfortunately I have no^ been successful in obtaining any other sh J in business locality anywhere in ^anrain. 1 also enquired from tne office of Advisor to Bahrain Govt as to when the shops would be constructed in the premises of custom shed in the main bazar and I was told that it would still require one year more at least. I have been promised by the -advisor one shop to my requirement as/f my request for this is on his record since three years or more. I also enquired if naif portion of the library in Hilal Buildings could be easily rented but tne reply was disappointing. J tfhile referring to Bahrain Govt, notification recently circulated in connection with rents for residential premises notning nas Lee# clearly mentioned about the rents on shops &amp; business premises. \ -u '-i . £ ■ilios has made tne lanilord of duaiiDasa premises interprelie that control over tne rent on shops is entirely lif ted up and as such took the law in their own haiuS and started harrassing their tenants hy serving tnem with''notices to vacate tne premises hut verbally demanding increase in rent from 2Q0/o to 500# ♦ ihere are several instances in ihe town and as far as I am given to understand that severdl compiaiuts are already placed before . your honour for assistance oc~ oruers. On the occasion of General body meeting of Bahrain General Merchants association held few days back several members explained their grievances on this subject how they are harrassed by tne landlords and enquired of the position of rent on business premises, ^he / / ; 5ovt. notofi cation v/as i^ead before all the members but no tiling/^ was clearly mentioned about shop premises* It is tnerefoi'e requested that thiSrpointT should be clarified so that every tenant may know his position and pace with the circumstances without wasting your time to-, diecide so may matters Drought to your notice from various parties* If at all the rent on business premises ia lifted up as interpreted by the landlords it requires further consideration &amp; orders in the best interests of poor tenants • as decided in case of residential premises tne similiar law should also be applied to shop premises in,which case both parties (landlord &amp; tenant) would get equal justice without any prejudice or partiality whatsoever. fhe question of shop is very whereas house can be obtained ihis difficulty will remain in existance for a short time only until G-ovt* shops are reauy af ter that the rents on the shops will naturally come down. Xne enormous depreciation in trade &amp; prices has already become a problem of disappointment to the importers and as the time goes the trade will further be greatly affected in which case if the tenants are harrassed by being charged exorbitant rents their conditions would be petiable. In conclusion I beg to request your honour to kindly decide once for all the position of rent c on shops as the time of expiry is fast approaening * ^ I shall feel greatly obliged to your early aecisiou. i *4 I beg to remain.

To The Adviser to the Bahrain Government, B a h r a i n Memorandum . I have recently received numerous complaints from shopkeepers that the rents of their shops and business premises.were raised to fantastic heights, sometimes by three or four hundred per cent, as soon as it became known that the recent Law of Rents and (p \'i?\ Leases (Regulation No.42/1365) did not apply to them.” A case in point is that of Fazal Mohammad, an Indian tailor long resident in Manama, who has been occupying a shop belonging to one Abdullah bin Hamad Al Fadhel for the last 15 years. During this period the original rent of Rs.l2/-p.m. has been gradually increased, and for the last one and a half years Fazal Mohammad has been paying Rs.30/-p.m. The agreement with the landlord expired some seven months ago, but although the landlord refused to renew it he continued to accept Rs.30/-p.m. for which he gave proper receipts. On the promulgation of the recent Law of Rents and Leases, however, the landlord immediately demanded Rs.l00/-p.m. Failing pay ment of which he gave notice to the tenant to vacate the shop on 12th October, 1946. Not unnaturally, Fazal Mohammad has refused either to pay the excessive rent demanded or to vacate the shop. 2. As you will remember, at His Highness* personal \ \\' request, vide your demi-official letter No.276-36 dated' the 2nd February, 1946, to Captain Bird, M amaras, shops, khans, business premises and barastis' were specifically excluded from the operation of the new law, but it was never intended that this omission should be made the pre text for landlords to claim the outrageous rents now being demanded for such buildings. 3. I suggest, therefore, that since His Highness is presumably averse to having the new law amended so as to include these types of buildings, a fresh Regulation should be issued immediately, limiting with retrospective effect the rents of all 'amaras, shops, khans, business premises and barastis' to a maximum equivalent to the respective rents charged for them on the 29th July, 1946, i.e., on the first day of the^nonth in which the new Law of Rents and Leases came into force. 4.

It seems to me that when both parties desire an assessment they should be able to apply to the Assessment Authority direct.

I have waited three months, the period during which the landlord is supposed to enter into an agreement and that period being over I am bringing this before you for your kind consideration. The next and the more important thing which I would like to bring to your notice is that the rent of the house is Re.80/- per month which is really exhorbitant for two rooms only. Therefore, I request you to kindly assess this rent and redress me of my grievences. In this connection I would like to put before you the fact that the land lord has done no repairs during my stay for the last six months in spite of my constant requests and that he asks for more rent on the top of that. Vv So, I hope your good offices will take up this matter for your early consideration. Yours fpithfully, copy toj HBM's Political Agent Manama, Bahrein.

Smales, who is a clerk in the Agency, I have myself inspected the house today. It consists only of 3 unfurnished rooms on the ground floor, and an Arab style lavatory upstairs, and I find it impossible to believe that its value can be Rs.25,000 or anything near that sum. The house is just across the road from your own, on the sea front, at the corner of prior Road. So, should you think it worth while inspecting it yourself, it would not take five minutes. 3. in any case, I should be grateful if you would kindly look into the facts of the case, and let me know, what, if any, is the justification for the valuation of the property at Rs.25,000. In the meanwhile would you kindly instruct the landlord to refrain from taking the case to court until the matter has been further investi gated? Yours sincerely, It C.D. Belgrave, Esq., C.B.E., Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain.

The facts about the rent are as follows, according to the statenent of the landlord. The house was let to B.O.A.C. for a year at fo.200/- per month and was vacated by them last Rajab. Mr. Smales hired it through Sadan bin Tulsi, a broker, for Li. 150/- per month. He was given the key and the agreement was sent to him fpr signing. He kept the agreement for some daysand then told the landlord that the rent should be according to Government assessment, which was the right action to take. The landlord says that he has been offered Ls.30,000/- for the house in question, this does not surprise me as His Highness was willing to pay hs.25,000/- for it, this fact however was not known to the committee which assessed its value. The house is well situated and is on land that has been reclaimed. Today it would cost that amount to build a similar house on a similar site in that vicinity. The Munici pality is going to build seven new four roomed houses for letting, their estimate of L).25,QQ0/- each which is for the construction only, not the value of the land. The new houses apposite the R.C. church, tohere there is a rock foundation, are costing about L&gt;.6Q,0Q0, they are being built by the Shia Wakf Department. Six more tyouses are to be built there. The value of property in Manama still abnormally high, recently an offer of one lakh was made to the landlord of Trikamdas’s shop, with the very decrepit first floor rooms. The landlordturned it down, because he did not wish to sell. I think the trouble is partly due to some of the firms, especially B.O.A.C. and Cable and Wireless who have been and still are paying exorbitant rents for houses in the town. The committee has now dealt with over two dozen cases, successfully, and as far as I know this is tbe first one in which their ruling has not been acceptable to the parties. In this case the landlord and tenant are both foreigners, if they were our own people they might be easier to deal with. The regulation does not provide for appeals but if you think it desirable tte case could be referred again to the committee for further consideration, though I think if this were done it would invite many similar requests for re hearing. f cs Captain H.D.H.

My dear Belgrave, \ j Reference correspondence ending with your demi- official letter No.410-36, dated the 20th January, 1247. I have another complaint received from one Mr. Thomas De Souza, a Bapco employee, regarding the assessment of rent for the house occupied by him and owned by Mr. Yousuf Shatar, father of Mr. Mahomed Saleh Shatar, the Secretary of the Manama JJunicipality. 2. De Souza states that the house has been assessed at Rs.25,000/--and the rent increased from Rs.55/- to Rs.34/5/4/- per month. Such enquiry as I have been able to make indicates that the valuation is excessive. I appreciate the pointy you made to Ranee in Sinaies * case that if once cases are heard M on appeai M , so to speak, and referred again to the committee for re-consideration, we shall have no end of appeals. If, however, you agree that the valuation has been excessive in Mr. De Souza’s case, would it be possible to have a closer supervision exercised upon the Assessment Committee in future* Yours sincerely,/ D.O. No. l S I m V V v / viserate, June 14, 1947. ^*1 With reference to your D.O* No.1453-6/82 dated 26th April, 1947, regarding the assessment of a house by the Rent Committee, Mohamed Saleh did not attend and so took no part in the assessment. The house was hired by the present tenant three years ago at a rent of IU;.40/- per month, since then rentals and land values have risen. Two families were occupying the house when the committee visited it. Some two or three years ago the owner wished to sell this house, and the adjacent one, to a foreigner but was dissuaded from doing so, I have reason to believe that he was offered 50,000 rials, which were then on a par with rupees, for the house in question and the adjoining building. In this case though the building is not very imposing the site adds to its value. The whole question is very difficult. I do not think that this house has been assessed at a value that is on a higher scale than other similar houses in the same area. Some of the cases which the committee have dealt with reveal strange situations, in one house which they visited lately one half of the building had been sub-let by the tenant for more than the rent which the tenant paid for the whole building. When landlords find conditions of this kind existing they naturally appeal for an increased rent. I do not suggest that this is the case in the house which you refer to but the building is apparently occupied by two families, not one, without the knowledge of the landlord. ^ c ^ „ .

The landlord is within his rights in asking for an assessment of the rent by the Assessment Committee, who in the present conditions prevailing in Bahrain, are sure to evaluate the rent at a figure considerably higher than Rs.lQ/- per month.

Whenever raining, during the last three or four months, I had not space in the house safe enough even to keep a bedding. Such was the condition when I made my requests to the land-lord. After the first rain of the season he did something to stop the leakage (with materials like coke or something) but had no effect at all. Under these circumstances I would request you to enlighten roe on following:- (1) Since the land-lord has not done the necessary repairs to stop leakages, can I get the repairs done and recover the cost from the land-lord. (2) Every succeeding year rent is increased by 10$ over the preceding year. Is this 10$ increase, as per Government rule, to be on the original amount (when the new regulation came into force) or on the preceding year’s rent? Trust you will excuse me for any inconvenience caused you. I beg to remain, Sir, Your most obedient servant, P.P.K. PILIAI.&gt;n February 6, 1948 Bahrein Mr. Hussain Mohamed Ahmadi, Manama. Dear Sir, I would recall recent conversation on various occasions I had with you to repair the terrace of my house to stop the During the last three months due to 3 er 4 rains the whole house was leaking and caused my household things and personal effects get wet and damaged. On two occasions you personally came and saw the state of affairs. Since last night it is raining. Not only my things got wet but there is no place to sleep or sit even. You have no consideration nor pity at all. me that due to the Palestine troubles your mind is not at rest and as such you cannot attend to anything. This is no excuse at all but it strikes me that you are evading the issue. out your normal business and your other personal affairs? Similarly others are also carrying out their usual life. Here the Palestine affair is not a blockade. Even this cause does not prevent you from increasing the rent by 10% without any repairs being done to the house you are increasing the rent every year and even this year also, when your mind is not at rest (as you say). Since you are increasing the rent every year you are legally bound to carry out any repairs to my house. However, I would request you again to carry out the repairs immediately so as to stop the leakage and thereby saving me from damage to my personal property. house as from 1st Jaimary 1948, Although you assured me that yeu will write out the new agreement and bring to me, you hawe not done so far.

PILLAI Copy to: Political Agent.% Ilo. of Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated, 16th Rajah, 1367 May 23, H. B. M f s Bahrain. Political Age r Memorandum:- i His Highness has received a petition fp^m the leading owners of property in Manama hogging him to cancel the Rent Control proclamation No. 42/1365, which was issued on 21st August 1946. 2. The petitioners argue that this law has had the result in putting a stop to the building of houses by private individuals for letting. They say that a return of 4$ on their capital is too little when profit on most other business transac tions is very much higher. They also refer to the high cost of maintaining buildings in good repair. 3. His Highness is in sympathy with the peti tioners and is of the opinion that if the present housing shortage is to be overcome the restriction on rents should be withdrawn. 4 4. My own view is that the rents of old existing houses should be restricted, to a certain extent, but there should be no restrictions in the case of new houses. This I believe would prove an incentive for building new houses for letting. Most of the building which is now being done in Manama is in houses which are occupied by their owners.

A return of 4 per cent on capital invested as securely as in house property in Bahrain seems about as much as should be expected. Presumably in many cases too the capital has already been re covered at least once over. 3. I am inclined to agree with your view that there should be no restriction on the rent of new houses although if put into practice this will pro bably be a factor additional to the several which have already appeared tending to make for further inflation in Bahrain.

His Highness has, at least once and Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa more than once, brought up to me the question of amending the 'Law of Rents and Leases' sc as to allow landlords to charge higher rents. You and I have also discussed it, I think^not recently. I have just had a reminder from His Highness referring to his last conversation with me about it expressing the view that there should be an amendment in the provision regarding rents. I write to say that I am open to consider any concrete proposal, though I think a representative of the tenants should also be heard. His Highness said that the Rent Restriction Law restrained people from putting their capital into houses,i.e. from building new ones. This may be so. At the same time my own fear is, which I expressed to His Highness, and I think also to you, that the increase in rents will increase the tendency towards inflation being followed immediately by a demand for higher wages. but Yours sincerely C.D.

They requested that the percentage to be charged as rent should be 7% - 8 %, His Highness suggested 6 % would be a reasonable figure. o / o (oJ) . 3. They also discussed clause 10(b) which they considered should have the additional words 'with the agreement of. the landlord'. As this clause is now worded a tenant can, if he wishes, retain the house which he leases in perpetuity provident that he doe snot offend in any of the ways men tioned i n 6 (a). 9 4. They also suggested that in clause 9(c) the following words should be added after the word 'house', 'or any part of the building'. It was stated that tenants claim that f : 1 to sublet* a part of the house is not contrary to the meaning »|f the regulation. 5. The landowners pointed out that old houses in Bahrain require a considerable amount of repai rs^ every year , many are built of stone and juss. The^cost of repairs and upkeep is now very high and there is no provision in the regulation under which the landlord can recover his expenses on upkeep which normally absorbs a Alarge proportion of the 4$ which he is allowed. Section 5 allows for the cost of additions to buildings being taken into consideration but it does not allow for such works as major or minor repairs, re-roofing, plastering, painting etc.S.0* No* Sit Political Agency, Bahrain.

Dear Sir, It is proposed to hold a meeting at the Agency on the 24th November, 1948, at 12.00 noon, to recommend the amendments which the Bahrain Government suggest to introduce to the existing •Law of Rents and Leases* No.42/1365, dated the 21st August, 1946. 2. I have nominated you to represent the views of tenants and shall be glad therefore if you will attend as above.

The Committee first discussed the suggestion that the percentage to be charged as. rent should be raised from the existing rate of on the value of the property. Mr. All fesa stated that the value of houses as assessed s 1 ncc tne i^aw of I ants and Leases came into force two years ago was far higher than their actual value as for some ten years previously rents had risen progressively, without check. He contended that any question of a further rise in the rent would therefore be inequitaole. It would, he added also, result in a rush for reassessment, which would result in houses being assessed at very much more than their actual value. He was supported by ilr. Dalvi. Mr. lindlay said that a return of 6$ on property was not unreasonable if the repairs were carried out by the Land lord and if the property was reassessed exclusive of the value of the aite. The other members then stated At once that oroper repairs by landlords were not and never had in fact been carried out. They agreed that assessment should be exclusive of the value of the site. £. ilie Co.amittee considered thse questions and considered t / 3 t a rise ** r °ro 4$ to on the rent would in effect be a 50f rise and that a lessee now paying Rs.60/- for a house would pay Rs.90/-. This they consider d wo’ Id be too great a rise and in the present days of high cost of living would only accentuate the tendency to increased inflation and a resultant demand in increased wages. The Committee recommends therefore that there should be no increase in the percentage of rent chargeable. They would only be willing to consider a rise if properties were reassessed excluding the vAlue of the site. 3. The Committee then discussed the addition of the words •with the agreement of the landlord” in clause 10 (a) of the Regulation, unanimous opinion was that the words should not be added as they nullify completely the right of the lessee to renew a lease, y/hich was the sole point of this clause. If the words suggested were introduced there would be noth ng to prevent landlords disagreeing to a lessee renewing the lease after one year and turning him out. T ! e Committee were of the opinion that 'e rights of landlords were adequately covered by Section 3 of the Law of bents and Leases.As regards inserting the words 'or any p. rt of the building' in clause 10 (c) of the Rogulation, the eoinalttee discussed this noint at length and considered that as long as the lessor got the proper rent the/e was no necessity of tnat adc3itioh* It was, howoveri reconanended that a oof in it ion o.t the word 'sublet' be asked for* It was observed that in the present acute shortage of accomddation In Bahrain it was sometimes neccss&amp;ry for a lessee to sha?e a large house with others* This the Committee conslde ed* was not 'snblettinj The Conmittee found no reason to amend Article 5 of the leg 5latj.cn as it &gt;;«.s ccrisiciered that by major or minor repairs the^l&amp;ndlord only maintains the house. Members further stated that in act al practice it wes v?ry seldom that repairs v/eie ever carried out by the landlords and it generally fell on the tenants to curry out necessary repairs therselves. Tbe Committee recommend that there should be at least two representatives of the tenants in the Assessment Committee as it is not at all representative of tenants, all the members being either landlords themselves or omplovoes of the Bahrain Government.THE BAHRAIN GENKft a MEK,: Bahrain, august 11,49. His Britanic Majesty* Bahrain. 'R MKKCHANTS' ASSOCIA7 V TON a A H I'ZhUjA ,1 njij'it ie, the undersigned merchants doing retail and wholesale business in Manamah request your honour to bear with us when we tender this petition on the subject of shop rents. Since the last three or four years the rents of residential houses and shops are increasing greatly and now the land lords are demanding enormous increase in 3 nop rents and quite out of proportion so much so that the increase in shop rents are demanded as much as five to six times the original contracted rents. In Bahrain, there is a ruling which checks the increase in house—rents and the landlords cannot increase the rent more than 10/o 01 tne rent every year or at the termination oi contract if any, but in the case of shop rents there is no such law and consequently there is no check on the landlords and they are given a free hand to demand as much as they choose to. we feel that this is rather unfair to the business community. Our selling prices are controlled and we are not allowed to make more than 25 % profit whereas our expenses are increasing enormously in all directions. This would look like one sided control on us and we beg your honour to remedy this and take steps to fix some limit xor the increase in shop rent also. ve pray that your honour will consider our petition sympath etically and iavourably and render us your very valuable assistance in lixing tne minimum increase in shop rents. ue beg to remain Yours faithfully Please reply to:£ The ceor tary, {terchants'Association, The decr.itary Merchants'Assi Bahrain.No.2763-6/82 Political Agency, Bahrain, October 13, 1949. Dear Smith, I have received a petition from the Bahrain General Merchants* Associa tion, which I understand is predominantly composed of foreign merchants, complaining of the exorbitant rise in shop rents. I see that when the question of the control of rents was under considera tion in 1946 it was decided, at a meeting held at the Agency on February 9 of that year when His Highness was present, to exclude shop rents from any contemplated legislation. The Association claims that as prices are controlled rents should also be controlled and 1 should be very glad to learn your views on this subject. Yours sincerely, H.G. Ja l ins G.W.F. Smith, Esq., Acting Adviser to the Bahrain Government. Bahrain.D. 0. No. / * P*- 3 &amp; Adviserate, November 5, 1949* io£&gt;. Reference your No.2763-6/82 dated 13th October 1949, I have discussed the question of rents with His Highness. His Highness is surprised that the petition from the Merchants* Association was not made to him; though doubtless many of the merchants are foreigners yet the organisation is one which was set up with the approval and co-operation of the Government. 2. His Highness considers that rent restrictions should only be applied in the case of living houses and not to shops. His view is that no shop should be let without a written lease, the absence of leases has, in his opinion, been the cause of demands for increased rents. The number of houses and shops in Mahama is steadily increasing and His Highness hopes that soon there will be sufficient premises for the needs of the people in the country. His Highness however does not view with any pleasure the numbers of foreigners who have recently entered Bahrain and who now occupy many of the shops which were previously occupied by Bahrain Arabs. This applies particularly to Indians who, His Highhess believes, in most cases send back to India the money which they earn in Bahrain. J.A.F. Gethin, Esquire, H. B.

If die tenant had a written lease and the lessor went against it the aggrieved party would rather go to the Court than to the Adviser.

In other cases the Banco employees are mostly affected. It is hardly necessary to comment on this case ae the question of increase in rent and the causes therefor will be discussed in oucsequent cases one by one. ^t it must be stated that tile increase is not affecting the Bapco employees alone but operates harshly against everbody who lias to live in a rented house Cases ^o s 2 &amp; 3 ; Mr .

But a verbal talk such as this can hardly be binding upon the landlord and, as it is, we cannot help Mr. Fernandez. Remedy: 2. Still, rented houses continure to fall vacant as the lessees go on leave and, if there is no check on the landlords, it will be impossible for foreigners to find a house. The draft rules of rents and leases (p.23) offer no remedy (they are all overwhelmingly in favour of landlords) and unless the draft is amended it will not be possible co protect the interest of persons subject to His Majesty's Jurisdiction in Bahrain. The Amendment may take the form of an additional rule to the following effect.

The Bahrain Government law has given a great-I TMI 7 lll fc i. ? tf]. impetus to tiie landlords to ^ivo notice to ti:eir tenants to vacate the house. Trie excuses usually put fofcth by them are (1) the house is wanted for repairs; (2) the owner wants to occupy the house himself* j (3) the own erf's son or servant is getting married and the house is wanted for him. « • 4 I had three such cases recently in my court and the land lords wanted to have die house vacated on one of these grounds. I have been telling the foreigners that this law does not apply to them but then we have no law of our own we cannot help them muci. and I have been able to settle these cases only by referring them to arbitration. /2' / 7A JrfL &amp;/? dtpy / /C 7 •*1 Amamm m 1. Please see the noting at paras 107 onwards. The present Law of Rents and Leases is at P.65 and your predecessor f s letter which originated the Kent Committee at P.90. The minutes of the meeting are below the note sheet and have not as yet been cir culated to the members. 2. The gist of the Rent Committee^ recommendations is that a) Provision should be made for the reassessment of muqawila leases. b) Provision should be made for the assessment of house property. c) Shops and amaras should be exempt from the Law of Rents and Leases. 3. Regarding 2 (c) I do not feel the Committee was sufficiently representative of public opinion to give its opinion on this point. There is an appeal I sent up yesterday which cannot really be decided until the general policy regarding shops is decided. I suggest that when sending the minutes of the Rent Committe to the Adviser we recommend this question is put to a sub-committee of merchants (about 9) for their opinion. 4. Regarding the other two points. Municipal taxes are at present Isvied on houses at -/l/6 per rupee of rent. The principle is wrong and municipal taxes are normally levied on the assessed value of the house property. I am a bit sceptical as to whether it is possible to assess all house property in Bahrain (which is what the Committee 1 recommendations amount to). In any. case I do not think it is the Rent Committee’s responsibility to do so - it should be the Bahrain Government Land Department’s work - bu! whether they are competent or able to do so is another matter. I do feel it should be done some time and all house property should be registered assessed and plans approved before building sanctioned. I think our i.. lediate action might be to write to the Adviser on the lines above when sending the minutes of the meeting asking him if the Bahrain Government are prepared to ' ; P.T.C AI 3.2 /JJ enbark on the work of assessing all house property* and if they are prepared to accept the principle that rents should be based on an 8 ^ annual return on the capital cost. If you agree I will put . up a draft. . 5. There were one or two other points whi ch arose after the meeting e.g (l) - clause should be inserted in the Law that oral evidence of any point for decision in any case under the rent law would not be admissible if the point in question should have been included in a written lease. (2) Responsibility for internal and external repairs should be clearly defined in written leases.

If the rent is calculated at 6% and the assessment is made on the existing market value of the property, the rent will go higher than what is at present. As for instance, the house in which I live was bought year before last by the landlord * for Rs. 14,000/-. According to the above rate the rent will be Rs.70/- per month i.e., a few rupees more than what I pay at present. It is obvious that assessment of a property will be made only when a dispute arises between a tenant and a landlord in respect of rent. Para 6. Sec.6. Since the members of the Muni cipalities will assess houses which are in their own area i.e., the members of the Manamah Municipality will assess the houses in Manamah and those of Muharraq the houses of Muharraq, it is plausible to appoint 2 # members from each of the Municipalities. • * ^ v •, Para 8. This will provide an additional ground for eviction. But since rebuilding of a house is desirable for the neatness of the towns', P.A. might accept this. Para 9. This will go to the interest of the tenants and may be accepted. Para 10. May be added as suggested. Para 12. Under the circumstances explained by the Adviser in para 13, the suggestion may be accepted.* ^ 215 216 V ♦. Para 13. There will, of course, be some difficulty in assessing houses at pre-war valuation. The Adviser »thinks that # if ° ld ^ new houses a i-e rated, without making distinction, at what they are worth to-day, the assessment would be easier resulting in an obligatory lowering of rents. If the valuation is made according to the present rate, I consider that the interest should not be allowed more than 4$. Para 14. P.A. might like to discuss with H.H. and settle the question once for all. ltd. M.A.H. . 24/6/46. A.B-*'^. I am in general agreement with I.A.'s noting, and, except as regards Sections 3,4,'and 5 of the Draft Law, -1 have inserted^ the amendments suggested by the'Adviset. ’ » « *&gt; * &lt; * * Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the- Draft Law and para 4 n-p Adviser's letter. * . V. •’ * (a) Section 3 is the most important Section in the Draft, and I consider that we must insist on a V 4 permissible rent. If the amount of rent payable is left entirely to the lessor and lessee to decide privately landlords will certainly find ways of forcing prospective.tenants to agree to pay exhorbitant rates just as they do at present. (b) For the same reasons I consider that Sections 4 &amp; 5 of the Draft Law should remain unaltered. (c) The landlords argue &gt; 1 y ^ ^ that the rent should be based on 6$, NOT 5$, , - -of the ’’capital outlay”, in which they wish to include both the value of the building and the * v value of its site. A (ii) that 'capital outlay” should be taken to mean the present day value of the building and site. (d) In my view, and^in that of the Adviser (vide para 13 of his letter) 5% is a generous return, and should in no circumstances be increased. Further, if we compromiseV to some extent, and accept the suggestion that houses should be assessed on their present day values, and that the site valu.es should be included, I consider the rent return should be • reduced to 4%. I a I do not feel that we shall get any further with this problem by further correspondence, and ‘f suggest that the points at issue as summarised in dr N/para 216, should be discussed and ‘settled at a i joint meeting between yourself, H.H. and the Adviser.
