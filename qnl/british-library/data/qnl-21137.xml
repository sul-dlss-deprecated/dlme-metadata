To the Islamic lorId By the great refuge, the proof of Islam, Shaikh Auhanmad hi sain, Kashif al Ghata, O’ kjslims for the past five months your brothers in Palestine have been suffering every sort of torture in the cause of recovering their lost rights and usurped honour. The people have been so trodden down in this cause that the city clamoured with sacrifices said was swamped with blood and the -British authority is going on with their 'humanitarian 1 act, destroying the towns, killing the people and frightening the women. This is done in such horrid cruelty that the earth and sky began to cry out against these acts. d* in slims, there are many villages at Palestine tnat have been turned into piles of ashes by dynamite and aeroplanes. iv -a n .7 meadows have been turned into dry deserts by the fire which is poured out on them by cannons and machine guns. The women ran away to take refuge but there was no refuge. i took refuge with safety from'one way but there came without it other ways for death. The authority did not desist from these deeds and were not satisfied with the present troops at Palestine , but reimorced them witn new troops. All this is going on in the name of insuring security and preserving peace and the %slims are quiet in the parts of the earth doing rnthiug. Palestine fought the best, defended the best and Stood in the face of injustices in such a way that shook dovai the thrones of the oppressors. Woe to the i^slims if Palestine went out of this tumult of battle thrown down and smashed. 0 Muslims fight with your properties and persons for one holy city and stand by your brothers as lions beforeohe death hovers on then when you repent and the repentance would be of no use and when you weep and the weeping would be useless. It does not suffice volunteering with property after the Ministry of Colonies published what they intended for the destruction of the holy hone. It is necessary to volunteer lives and give freely the blood and God will assist the man when he assists his brother. s d/ Muhammad husain Al Kashif al Ghata.CONFIDENTIAL. No. 838-S of 19iie.

To Political Resident, Bushire Repeated to Political Agent, Bahrain Followin Government’s statement on Palestine. BEGINS. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom by direction of His Majesty have considered the un animous report of Palestine Royal Commission. They find themselves in general agreement with the argu ments and conclusions of Commission. 2. As is fully recognised by Commissioners in their historical survey His Majesty’s Government and their predecessors since the obligations of the Mandate were accepted have taken the view which the tenor of the Mandate itself implies that their obligations to Arabs and Jews respectively were not incompatible on the .assumption that in the process of time the two races would so adjust their national aspirations as to render possible the establishment of a single Commonwealth under a unitary government. 5. In spite of many discouraging experiences during past seventeen years His Majesty’s Government have based their policy on this expectation and have taken every opportunity of encouraging co-operation between Arabs and Jews. In the light of experience and of arguments/*© - 2 - arguments adduced by the Commission they are driven to conclusion that there is an irreconcilable conflict bet ween aspirations of Arabs and Jews in Palestine that these aspirations cannot be satisfied under terms of present Mandate and that a scheme of partition on ge neral line recommended by Commission represents best an d most hopeful solution of deadlock. His Majesty’s Government propose to advise His Majesty accoMingly. 4. His Majesty’s Government therefore propose to take such steps as are necessary and appropriate having regard to their existing Treaty Obligations under Cove nant of League of Nations and other international ins truments to obtain freedom to give effect to a scheme of partition to which they earnestly hope that it may be possible to secure an effective measure of consent on the part of communities concerned. 5. Pending establishment of such a scheme His Majes ty’s Government have no intention of surrendering their responsibility for peace order and good government through out Palestine. They are in general agreement with Com mission’s recommendations in the matter of public security. If serious disorders should again break out of such a na ture as to require military intervention High Commissioner will delegate powers in respect of whole country under Palestine (Defence) Orders-in-Counoil to General Officer Commanding Military Foroues. 6. In the immediate future while form of a scheme of partition is being worked out His Majesty’s Government propose that as an interim measure steps should be taken to prohibit any land transactions which might prejudice such/-I &gt; v » -5- such a scheme. Further since period of curBent labour schedule expires at end of July and some provision mist be made for the ensuing period they propose that a total Jewish immigration in all categories of 8000 persons shall be permitted for eight months period August 1937 to March 1938 provided that economic absorptive capacity of country is not exceeded. 7. In supporting a solution of the Palestine pro blem by means of partition His Majesty’s Government are mich impressed by advantages which it offers both to Arabs and Jews. Arabs would obtain their national Independence and thus be enabled to co-operate on an equal footing with Arabs of neighbouring countries in cause of Arab unity and progress. They would be final ly delivered from all fear of Jewish domination and from anxiety which they have expressed lest their holy places should ever come under Jewish control. Arab State would receive financial assistance on a substantial scale both from His Majesty’s Government and from Jewish State. On the other hand partition would secure estab lishment of Jewish national home and relieve it from any possibility of its being subjected in the future to Arab rule. It would convert Jewish national home into a Jewish State with full control over immigration. Its nationals would acquire a status similar to that en joyed by nationals of other countries. Jews would at last cease to live a '’minority life' and prinery ob jective of 'Zionism would thus be attained. Under pro posed Treatis rights of minorities in both States would be/-Telegram From To Political Resident, Bushire. Political Agent, Bahrain. Political Agent, Kuwait. No. 713.

As His Highness quite aptly, I think, pointed out it is out of the question to expel completely from the country either the Arabs or the Jews and as neither seemed to be able to live peaceably side by side with one another the present proposals to allot separate portions of the country to each nation would appear to be the so}.e solution to the problem.

A memo randum containing relevant extracts from the Statement ol Policy and the resolutions in question, and containing also extracts from Ministerial statements, is enclosed for convenience of reference. 2. I feel that it is necessary to emphasize certain implications of the acceptance in principle by His Majesty’s Government of the recommendations contained in Part III of the Report of the Royal Commission,* and to dispel, if possible, the uncertainty which appears to exist in some quarters with regard to the course of action which His Majesty’s Government have in view. 3. In the Statement of Policy His Majesty’s Government have expressed their general agreement with the arguments and con clusions of the Royal Commission and their opinion that a scheme of tripartite division is the best and most hopeful solution of the problem. In view of the public attention that has been devoted to criticism of certain features of the tentative plan of partition which is outlined in Part III of the Report of the Royal Commission, I wish to make it clear that His Majesty s Government are in no sense committed to approval of that plan, and in particular that they have not accepted the Commission’s proposal for the compulsory transfer in the last resort of Arabs from the Jewish to the Arab area. 4. In the opinion of His Majesty’s Government the discussions at Geneva justify the undertaking of the further investigations required for the drawing up of a more precise scheme expressed in greater detail. The final decision cannot be taken in merely general terms, and the further enquiry will undoubtedly provide the necessary materials on which, when the best possible scheme has been formulated, to judge of its equity and practicability. 5. As you are aware, it has been announced that a further special body will be appointed to visit Palestine, and to submit to His Majesty’s Government, after consultation with the local communities, proposals for a detailed scheme of partition; and that it will be the task of this body to advise in due course as to the provisional boundaries of the proposed Arab and Jewish3 areas and of the new British Mandated area, and also to under take the financial and other enquiries for which the Royal Com mission recommended that a Financial Commission should be appointed. The functions of this new body will be to act as a technical Commission, that is to say, its functions will be con fined to ascertaining facts and to considering in detail the practical possibilities of a scheme of partition. 6. The terms of reference of the technical Commission will be as follows: — “ Taking into account the plan of partition outlined in Part III of the Report of the Royal Commission, but with full liberty to suggest modifications of that plan, including variation of the areas recommended for retention under British Mandate, And taking into account any representations of the com munities in Palestine and Trans-Jordan— (i) to recommend boundaries for the proposed Arab and Jewish areas and the enclaves to be retained per manently or temporarily under British Mandate which will— (а) afford a reasonable prospect of the eventual establishment, with adequate security, of self-sup porting Arab and Jewish States; (б) necessitate the inclusion of the fewest pos sible Arabs and Arab enterprises in the Jewish area and vice versa; and (c) enable His Majesty’s Government to carry out the Mandatory responsibilities the assumption of which is recommended in the Report of the Royal Commission, including the obligations im posed by Article 28 of the Mandate as regards the Holy Places; (ii) to examine and report on the economic and financial questions involved in partition upon which decisions will require to be taken, including— (а) the allocation so far as may be necessary between the various areas of the public assets and public debt of Palestine and other ‘ financial obligations legitimately incurred by the Adminis tration of Palestine during the period of the Mandate ’ referred to in Article 28 thereof; (б) means to ensure that the financial obliga tions referred to above will be fully honoured in accordance with Article 28 of the Mandate; (c) the administration of the railways, ports, postal, telegraph and telephone services;IV ! i 4 {d) currency arrangements; (e) customs administration and tariffs; (/) the budgetary prospects of the various Ad ministrations to be established; (g) the preservation of the rights of civil servants in accordance with the provisions of Article 28 of the Mandate; (h) the treatment of industrial and other con cessions ; (i) the possibility of voluntary exchanges of land and population, and the prospects of providing by works of land development room for further settlement to meet the needs of persons desiring to move from one area to another; (j) the provision of effective safeguards for the rights of religious or lacial minorities in the areas to be allocated to Arab and Jews respectively, including the protection of religious rights and properties.” 7. If, as a result of the investigations of the technical Com mission, which will undoubtedly occupy many months, a scheme of partition is regarded as equitable and practicable by His Majesty's Government, it will be referred to the Council of the League for consideration. If the scheme is approved by the League Council, a further period will be required for the establishment of new systems of government under mandate in the areas concerned and, if the necessary consent is forth coming, for the negotiation of treaties with a view to the eventual establishment of independent States. It may also be necessary, in the light of the Commission's report, for His Majesty’s Government to give further consideration to the suggestion of the Permanent Mandates Commission that the Arab and Jewish areas should be administered temporarily under a system of “ cantonisation ” or under separate mandates. It is obvious, therefore, that, for some time to come, any action taken will be only of an exploratory nature. 8. I will communicate with you further in due course on the subject of the personnel of the Commission and its procedure. I have, &amp;c., 4 W. ORMSBY GORE High Commissioner, General Sir Arthur Wauchope, G.C.M.G., K.C.B., C.I.E., D.S.O., etc., etc., etc.SUMMARY OF RECENT STATEMENTS AND RESOLUTIONS 1. Statement of Policy. In the Statement of Policy of July, 1937 (Cmd. 5513) it was stated that His Majesty’s Government had been driven to the conclusion “ that a scheme of partition on the general lines recommended by the Commission represents the best and most hopeful solution of the deadlock ” “ His Majesty’s Government, therefore, propose to take such steps as are necessary and appropriate .... to obtain freedom to give effect to a scheme of partition, to which they earnestly hope that it may be possible to secure an effective measure of consent on the part of the communities concerned.” 2. Parliament. The House of Commons, on the 21st July, 1937, passed a resolution to the following effect: — “ That the proposals contained in Command Paper No. 5513 relating to Palestine should be brought before the League of Nations with a view to enabling His Majesty’s Government, after adequate enquiry, to present to Parlia ment a definite scheme taking into full account all the recommendations of the Command Paper.” 3. Statements by Mr. Ormsby Gore before Perma?ient Mandates Commission. “ What I ask is that you should advise the Council that, in the light of our experience and our knowledge of Palestine, a solution on the lines of partition should be explored as the best and most hopeful solution of what the mandatory Power is itself convinced is, in fact, a deadlock. I do not ask you to approve a scheme of partition, or to settle these questions of defence, minorities, &amp;c. All I ask you is to recommend that the door should not be closed to a solution by partition. I ask you to open the door and not to close it. I do not ask the Mandates Commission to commit itself finally, but to allow the mandatory Power to explore the solution which it thinks best in the circum stances, and to produce for the League in due course a more definite scheme for your later consideration.” (Minutes of Thirty-Second Session, pp. 37-38.) * * * * “ It was his belief that, in view of the actual wording of the Royal Commission's report, and in view of the mandatory Power’s declaration that a deadlock had arisen and that its hopes of seeing Palestine evolve into a self-governing State, where Jews and Arabs would have reconciled their differences, had not been fulfilled, and in view of the fact that neighbouring6 Arab States had intervened, and in view of all the efforts sincerely made to work the mandate as drafted, he was satisfied that no British Government could administer Palestine on the basis of the existing mandate without considerable alterations.' (Minutes, p. 169.) * * * * ' The idea that it would be open to the United Kingdom or any other Power to carry on the existing mandate was an idea in which he hoped the Mandates Commission would not take refuge. He said frankly, not speaking for himself, but speaking on behalf of the United Kingdom Government, that the prospects of carrying on indefinitely on the terms of the existing mandate seemed to His Majesty’s Government to be a commitment involving repression, involving continual friction and hostility between each of the two races, on the one hand, and the Administration on the other, as well as between the two races themselves, in a manner which could not inure to the advantage of any one of the three parties concerned—or, for that matter, to the credit of the mandate system or of the League itself. ' Mr. Ormsby Gore was satisfied that a new solution—a political solution, as he had described it—of the problem of Palestine must be explored in the interests of the future peace of Palestine, and, further, in the wider interest of the future relations between the Jews and the world of Islam, for the benefit of the suffering Jews in Europe, as well as for the benefit of the peace of the world. It was in the light of these broad political considerations that he came before the Mandates Com mission, not as an administrator, but quite frankly as a politician, to say that, in his opinion, and in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, it was essential that a solution of what they regarded quite definitely as a deadlock should be explored.' (Minutes, pp. 184-185.) * * * * ' [Mr. Ormsby Gore] had certainly had no intention of con veying the impression that the Balfour Declaration was not still a binding obligation on both the League and the United Kingdom. Obviously, like the mandate, it was still a binding obligation, and would remain so until replaced by an in dependent Jewish State. It was only if the suggested plan of partition were accepted, and eventuated in the creation of a Jewish State, that the Balfour Declaration would reach its fruition and cease to be binding. Similarly, the mandate was binding until it was replaced by another regime in Palestine.' (Minutes, p. 182.) * * * * “ The Mandates Commission would see that the solution re commended by the Arab Higher Committee implied: first, the7 retention by the Arabs of the right to complete independence in their own land, which they described as the whole of Palestine; second, the cessation (whatever that meant) of the experiment of the Jewish National Home; third, the cessation of the British mandate and its replacement by a treaty similar to those existing between the United Kingdom and Iraq, the United Kingdom and Egypt, and France and Syria, constitut ing Palestine a sovereign State; and, fourth, the immediate cessation of all Jewish immigration and of land sales to Jews pending the conclusion of the treaty. That solution, Mr. Ormsby Gore wished to say, quite frankly, was unacceptable to the United Kingdom Government if it were for the whole of Palestine.’’ (Minutes, p. 191.) * * * * “ I take it that the basic principle of any partition scheme would be to leave as few Jews as possible in the Arab State; indeed, even under the proposals of the Royal Commission, that seems to be the main basis upon which it has acted, and would, I believe, be the only possible basis on which a frontier could be drawn. But, however you draw that frontier, it is inevitable that there will be a large Arab minority in the Jewish State, and it is therefore politically wise, and indeed necessary, that special provisions should be made for the legitimate safeguard ing of the interests of that minority. And again, on the other side, though an appreciable number of the Christians will be in the proposed British mandatory enclave, there will be, in the proposed Arab State, however you draw that frontier, a con siderable number of Christians.’’ (Minutes, p. 37.) * * * * “ Therefore, I grant that provisions for safeguarding minori ties will have to be made over and above the ordinary pro visions which are made in the ordinary minorities treaties operating under League auspices in many countries in Europe. ... I see no reason why, in the case of Palestine, we should be strictly limited to the kind of procedure which operates in those European States.” (Minutes, p. 37.) 4 . Permanent Mandates Commission. The Report of the Permanent Mandates Commission to the Council of the League on the work of its Thirty-second (Extra ordinary) Session contains the following conclusions: — ” The Commission therefore considers that it is worth con tinuing the examination of the advantages and drawbacks of a new territorial solution. It appears quite natural and legiti mate that the mandatory Power, rightly anxious to give satis faction to the conflicting aspirations of Arabs and Jews in Palestine, and having failed to do so by the institution of a8 common administration for the whole territory, should be em powered to contemplate in some form or other the establish ment of a regime in which these aspirations would each be satisfied in a part of the territory. “ This satisfaction cannot, of course, be complete. For the Arabs, any partition must necessarily involve the abandonment of a fraction of what they consider to be their hereditary patrimony. For the Jews, it could involve, together with a restriction of the scope of their national home, already limited, as they allege, by the exclusion of Trans-Jordan in 1922, a fresh reduction in its capacity of absorbing population. “ Any solution to prove acceptable should therefore deprive the Arabs of as small a number as possible of the places to which they attach particular value, either because they are their present homes or for reasons of religion. And, further, the areas allotted to the Jews should be sufficiently extensive, fertile and well situated from the point of view of communications by sea and land to be capable of intensive economic development, and consequently of dense and rapid settlement. . . . “ The Commission would be failing in its duty if it did not draw the Council’s attention to the delicate problem of the transfer of populations from one territory to the other which might be necessary if there was a partition. In order to guarantee that the advantages of such a transfer should out weigh the disadvantages, particular care would have to be given to ensure that it was carried out with the greatest fairness. “ As regards the proposal to withdraw the Holy Places from the domination of Arabs and Jews and place them under a special regime, the Commission thinks that such a step could not but be of advantage to general peace, provided that this regime was based on Article 28 of the present mandate. . . . ‘ ‘ While declaring itself favourable in principle to an examina tion of a solution involving the partition of Palestine, the Com mission is, nevertheless, opposed to the idea of the immediate creation of two new independent States. . . . “ The Commission therefore considers that a prolongation of the period of political apprenticeship constituted by the man date would be absolutely essential both to the new Arab State and to the new Jewish State. This apprenticeship might be carried on in one of two forms.” “ Provisional cantonization ” and “ Two Mandates ” are then discussed. 5. Extracts from the Speech of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs at the gSth Session of the Council of the League of Nations, on the \\th September, 1937. “ I would remind the Council that the Balfour Declaration itself had a dual character. On the one hand, it provided for9 the Jewish national home, on the other it laid down the con dition that nothing should be done which might prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine or the rights or political status enjoyed by Jews elsewhere. “ It is clear that under these provisions a twofold task was imposed upon the mandatory Power. It was under an obliga tion to further the establishment of the Jewish national home, and at the same time it was bound to do its best to guide the country as a whole along the path towards full nationhood. Indeed, the development of self-governing institutions is one of the objects specifically prescribed in Article 2 of the mandate. “ At the time when the mandate was drawn up by our pre decessors it was clearly not contemplated that these two obliga tions would prove mutually incompatible. . . . No one, least of all the mandatory Power itself, or the Council of the League, who approved the form of the mandate, anticipated that the future would be entirely free from difficulties. But it was hoped that the two races in Palestine would so adjust their national aspirations as to render possible the establishment of a single self-governing commonwealth under a unitary Government. This hope has, unfortunately, not been fulfilled. The reasons for its non-fulfilment are admirably set forth in Chapter 20 of the report of the Royal Commission. . . . Stated briefly, their conclusion is that the attempt has failed, not from any fault on the part of the Administration, or from any hesitation in apply ing the mandate, but because the conflict between Arab and Jewish political aspirations, which was inherent in the situa tion from the first, has tended to be confirmed by certain pro visions of the mandate itself. It has, moreover, been intensified, not only by the estranging forces of conditions inside Palestine, but perhaps even more by external factors beyond the control of the British Administration in Palestine. “ These external factors fall into two main sections. Firstly, there has been a growth of anti-semitism, and the development of new economic and social conditions, in certain European countries, which have resulted in increased desire on the part of the Jews, and increased pressure on His Majesty’s Govern ment to find room in Palestine for largely increased numbers of Jewish refugees. Secondly, there has been the growth of Arab nationalism throughout the Arabic-speaking countries and their increasing concern in the future political destiny of Palestine. “ I am anxious to avoid over-statement, but I do wish to say, with all the emphasis in my power, that these new factors, which no one could have foreseen when the mandate was drawn up and approved by the Council, have transformed the whole situation and have created a new set of conditions underwhich the policy which was contemplated some two decades ago, and which we have done our utmost to carry out ever since, has become definitely unworkable. . . . “ That is the situation in which His Majesty’s Government come to the Council to-day. Palestine is a mandated territory administered by Great Britain on behalf of the League. The Palestine problem is not merely one that concerns Arabs and Jews, or one for which His Majesty’s Government alone is required to find a solution. It is a problem that concerns the League as a whole. The mandatory Power can take no steps towards the modification of the mandatory regime without the authority of the League. His Majesty’s Government clearly can not proceed to work out the details of any scheme of partition, such as has been suggested by the Royal Commission, unless they are assured that they have the general approval of the Council in embarking on this task. It is for that general approval that I ask to-day. “ My colleagues will have seen the statement of policy issued by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom at the time of the publication of the Royal Commission’s report. In that statement the opinion was recorded ‘ that a scheme of parti tion on the general lines recommended by the commission repre sents the best and most hopeful solution of the deadlock.’ To that opinion we adhere All I ask at this stage is that His Majesty’s Government shall be given authority to proceed forthwith to work out the details of such a scheme, if possible in co-operation with representatives of both Jews and Arabs, it being understood that no scheme will be put into effect without further reference to, and approval by, the Council. “ The procedure that His Majesty’s Government have in mind, if the Council give their general approval to the policy which I have outlined, is to appoint a further special body to visit Palestine, to negotiate with Arabs and Jews and to submit to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom proposals for a detailed scheme of partition. It would be the task of this body to advise, in due course, as to the pro visional boundaries of the proposed Arab and Jewish States and of the new British mandated area, and also to undertake the financial and other enquiries for which the Royal Com mission recommended that a financial commission should be appointed. “ At a later stage, a final and detailed boundary demarca tion commission would need to be appointed “ In the view of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, partition is the only ultimate solution. It alone admits of the fulfilment both of Article 22 of the Covenant, which contemplates independence as the goal of all territoriesII in the category of ‘ A ’ mandates, and of the obligation to establish in Palestine a national home for the Jewish people. “ What His Majesty’s Government contemplate is not a dual but a tripartite division of the country, for they take it from the terms of Article 28 of the existing mandate that it is the intention and wish of the League that the Holy Places, including the Christian Holy Places, should remain permanently under League supervision and control. The vast majority of the Christian Holy Places are in the three cities of Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Nazareth. The two latter are almost entirely Christian towns. In the old city of Jerusalem and its imme diate environs are not only many historic religious sites, but the religious settlements of many faiths. We think it will be in accordance with the wishes of the vast majority of States Members of the League that, when contemplating the ultimate establishment of Jewish and Arab States in the Holy Land sacred to all three religions, these religious sites and institutions should be placed permanently in the care of a Power acting on behalf of and responsible to the League as a whole for what must always be a sacred trust ” 6. Council of the League. The Council of the League, on the 16th September, 1937 » adopted the following resolution: — “ In view of the United Kingdom Government’s statement of July, 1937, concerning the conclusions of the Royal Com mission on Palestine; “ In view of the preliminary opinion given to the Council by the Mandates Commission; “ In view of the statement made by the Representative of the United Kingdom at the Council meeting of September 14th, 1937, and the discussion on the status of Palestine which took place at the same meeting; “ Having regard to the intention expressed by the United Kingdom Government of pursuing the study of the problem of the status of Palestine while concentrating on a solution involving partition of the territory; “ Recalling the assurances given in that connection by the Representative of the United Kingdom on the subject of immi gration ; “ The Council: “ Agrees to the United Kingdom Government’s carrying out the aforesaid study and taking such steps as it may entail; “ And, while pointing out that the Mandate of July 24th, jm. 1922, remains in force until such time as it may be otherwise decided, defers consideration of the substance of the question until the Council is in a position to deal with it as a whole and in the meantime entirely reserves its opinion and its decision.’'47121—29) Wt. x866—3979 4040 1/38 P St. G. 335 12 7.

Dated, 4:tn January 1938. Following is a text 01 tne despatch sent by tne Colonial Secretary to H.N.the High Commissioner on tne 23rdcDecember 1937:- Your Excellency, I have tne honour to inform you that His Majesty f s Government in the United Kingdom have considered tne note of policy to be observed m Palestine issued last July (White Book No.DDl3)and tne results which were taken from the decisions arrived at on this subject firstly by the House of Commons and then by the Permanent Committee of Mandates and the Chamber and Committee of tne League of Nations. I am lorwarumg to you extracts from the said note oi policy and tne aforesaid decisions together with extracts from the Ministerial statements for easy reference. 2. I feel it necessary to confirm certain reasons., on which the approval oi His Majesty's Government are based, as a preliminary acceptance, for the recommendations mentione in the third part oi the Royal Commission Report, and to remove, if possible, the doubt which certain bodies seem to be having in regard to the line of action which His Majesty's Government propose to take. 3. In the above note of policy His Majesty’s Government expressed their general approval of the arguments set forth by the Royal Commission, the conclusions which they arrived at and the views which they expressed that a scheme for the partition of Palestine into three parts is the best and most salutary solution for the problem. In view of the interest shown by tue public opinion in criticising certain aspects of the experimental partition scheme, the details of which are shown in Part 3 of the Royal Commissioni Report, I would like to explain clearly tnat His majesty’s Government are not bound, in any way, to accept tdat sciieme ana that they, as a sepcial case, aia not agree to the suggestion made by the Commission to the effect that it is ultimately necessary to have the Arabs removed by force from the Jewish to that of the Arab District. 4. His Majesty T s Government are of the opinion that the discussions which took place in Geneva justify making further necessary investigations in order to bring into existence a better and more detailed scheme. That the final decision cannot be put up in mere common expressions, ana there is no doubt that, when the best possible scheme is finally prepared, this further investigation will provide the necessary essentials for deciding that such a scheme is reasonable and can be made applicable, b. As you are aware, it was previously announced that another special committee will be appointee f.nd sent to Palestine to submit to His majesty’s Government, after consultation with the local communities, proposals for a detailed partition scheme and that tms committee will be instructed to give aavice, whenever convenient, on the preliminiray boundaries separating the proposed Arab ana Jewish Districts ana tne new British Mandatory District ana to make enquiries into financial ana other matters for which the fioyal Commission rebommendea the appointment of a finance ial Committee. The duties of the new committee will be technical, i.e., their duties are restricted to ascertaining the actual state of affairs ana to making enquiries in detail as to whether there is any possibility of making the partition scheme practically applicable. £• The powers of this committee will be as follows After giving due consideration to the partition scheme the details of which are shown in Part 3 of the Royal Commission Report, and granting them full liberty to suggestamendments tor tnat scheme which include a change in the districts recommended to be under mandate ana, after giving due consideration to representations from all the communities in Palestine and Transjoroama,the Committee are requirea:- (1) To recommend boundaries separating tne proposed Arab and Jewish Districts ana the 'Special Areas' which are to be kept, permanently or temporarily, under British Mandate, provided that these boundaries (a) provide a reasonable hope for the ultimate establishment of an Arab State and a Jewish State each being able to bear its own expenditure independently, and provide means for the maintainance of complete tranquility, (b) that it may not be necessary to admit but the smallest possible number of Arabs and Arab schemes into the Jewish District and vice-versa, (c) to put His ^ajesty T s Government in a position to carry out the mandate responsibilities which were recommended by the Royal Commission in their report. This includes the obligations laid down in Article 28 of the Pact of Mandate m respect of the Holy Places. (2) To scrutinize economical and financial matters involved by the partition about which measures are to be taken and a report to be submitted whicn should also include the following matters:- (a) a statement showing the share of each of these districts from the possessions ana debts of Palestine in general and all the financial obligations borne legitimately by the Palestine Adminsitration during the period of Mandate mentioned in Article 28 of the Pact of mandate as far as it is considered essential, (b) the means which ensure the complete respect of the above-mentioned financial obligations inaccordance witn ArJ^cle 28 ol' tne Pact of Mandate, (c) Admimstration of Railway, wharf, Post,Telegrpah .ana Telephone Services, (d) measures concerning the currency, (ej customs administration ana customs tarifis, (f) matters concerning the buaget of each of these Administrations which will be formed in every district, (g) protection of the rights of Government Servants in accordance with the provisions of Article 28 of the Pact of Mandate, (h) looking into industrial and other monopolies, (i) possibility of making optional exchange in lands and population ana the probability of finding other areas for settlement ana immigratior by means of carrying out works for the imprcjfement of the areas so as to meet the requirements of tne people who wish to move from one district to another, (j) finding adequate guarantee for the protection of the religious and racial rights of minorities in both the districts fixed for Arabs ana Jews* This includes the protection of rights ana religious property. V. If His majesty T s Government decided, as a result of tne investigations made by the Technical Committee which will, no doubt, take several months to complete, tnat a scheme for partition is reasonable and practical, this scheme will be submitted to the League of Nations lor consideration. Ii the League of Nations approve of the scheme, it would be necessary to allow some more time for the formation of new rules for the Mandatory Governments in the uistmcts concerned and lor negotiation for making treaties, subject to the requisite approval, as a preliminary step for thefinal formation of two independent Governments* It may also be necessary for His Majesty T s Government, in tne lignt oi tne Committee T s Report,to consider again tne suggestion of tne Permanent Committee of Mandates to tne effect tnat it$ is necessary tnat tne Arab and Jewisn Districts snould be . e administered, as a temporary measure, on tne basis oi 'province regulations” or to be under two separate Mandates. It is, tderefore, clear tnat every step taken will be of an optional nature only until after a lapse of time. 8. I will send you anotner despatch in due course in regard to the members oi tne Committee and tne line of action i that they should adopt. Usual Ending. Sd.

November 9th, 1938. PALESTINE Statement by His Majesty s Government in the United Kingdom. 1 . The JRoyal Commission, presided over by the late Earl Teel, published its report in July, 1937 , and proposed a solution of the Palestine problem by means of a scheme of partition under which independent Arab and Jewish States would be established while other areas would be retained under mandatory administration. In their statement of policy following upon the publication of the report His Majesty’s Government in the I'nited Kingdom an nounced their general agreement with the arguments and con clusions of the Royal Commission, and expressed the view that a scheme of partition on the general lines recommended by the Commission represented the best and most hopeful solution of the deadlock. ■2. The proposal of the Commission was framed in the light of the information available at the time, and it was generally re cognised that further detailed examination would lie necessary before it could be decided whether such a solution would prove practicable. This proposal was subsequently discussed in Par liament and at meetings of the Permanent Mandates Commission and the Council and the Assembly of the League of Nations, when His Majesty’s Government received authority to explore the prac tical application of the principle of partition. A despatch of December 23 rd, 1937 , from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High Commissioner for Palestine, announced the intention of His Majesty’s Government to undertake the further investiga tions required for the drawing up of a more precise and detailed scheme. It was pointed out that the final decision could not be taken in merely general terms and that further enquiry would provide the necessary material on which to judge, when the best— 2 — possible partition scheme had been formulated, its equity and practicability. The despatch also defined the functions and terms of reference of the technical Commission who were appointed to visit Palestine for the purpose of submitting in due course to His Majesty’s Government proposals for such a detailed scheme. 3 . His Majesty’s Government have now received the report of the Palestine Partition Commission who have carried out their investigations with great thoroughness and efficiency, and have collected material which will be very valuable in further consid eration of policy. Their report is now published, together with a summary of their conclusions. It will be noted that the four members of the Commission advise unanimously against the adoption of the scheme of partition outlined by the Royal Com mission. In addition to the Royal Commission’s scheme, two other schemes described as plans P and C are examined in the report. One member prefers plan B. Two other members, including the Chairman, consider that plan C is the best scheme of partition which, under the terms of reference, can he devised. A fourth member, while agreeing that plan ,C is the best that can be devised under the terms of reference, regards both plans as impracticable. The report points out that under either plan, while the budget of the Jewish State is likely to show a substantial surplus, the budgets of the Arab State (including Trans-Jordan) and of the Mandated Territories are likely to show substantial deficits. The Commission reject as impracticable the Royal Commission’s recommendation for a direct subvention from the Jewish State to the Arab State. They think that on economic grounds a customs union between States and Mandated Territories is essential and they examine the possibility of finding the solution for the financial and economic problems of partition by means of a scheme based upon such a union. They consider that any such scheme would be inconsistent with the grant of fiscal independence to the Arab and Jewish States. Their conclusion is that, on a strict interpretation of their terms of reference, they have no alternative hut to report that they are unable to recommend boundaries for the proposed areas which will afford a reasonable prospect of the eventual establishment of self-supporting Arab and Jewish States. 4 . His Majesty’s Government, after careful study of the Partition Commission’s report, have reached the conclusion that this further examination has shown that the political, adminis trative and financial difficulties involved in the proposal to create independent Arab and Jewish States inside Palestine are so great that this solution of Ihe problem is impracticable.0 ® — 3 — 5 . His Majesty’s Government will therefore continue their responsibility for the government of the whole of Palestine. They are now faced with the problem of finding alternative means of meeting the needs of the difficult situation described by the 'Royal Commission which will be consistent with their obligations to Arabs and Jews. His Majesty’s Government believe that it is possible to find these alternative means. They have already given much thought to the problem in the light of the reports of the Royal Commission and of the Partition Commission. It is clear that the surest foundation for peace and progress in Palestine would be an understanding between Arabs and Jews, and His Majesty’s Government are prepared in the first instance to make a determined effort to promote such an understanding. With this end in view, they propose immediately to invite represent atives of the Palestinian Arabs and of neighbouring states on the one hand and of the Jewish Agency on the other, to confer with them as soon as possible in London regarding the future policy, including the question of immigration into Palestine. As regards the representation of the Palestinian Arabs His Majestv’s Govern ment must reserve the right to refuse to receive those leaders whom they regard as responsible for the campaign of assassination and violence. 0 . His Majesty s Government hope that these discussions in London may help to promote agreement as to future policy re garding Palestine. They attach great importance, however, to a decision being reached at an early date. Therefore, if the London discussions should not produce agreement within a reasonable period of time, they will take their own decision in the light of their examination of the problem and of the discussions in London, and announce the policy which they propose to pursue. 7 . In considering and settling their policy His Majesty’s Government will keep constantly in mind the international character of the mandate with which they have been entrusted and their obligations in that respect.■■—ry” Telegram Inter To From High Commissioner, Jesuralem.

PALESTINE The following is the text of a statement made by the Secretary of State for the Colonies in the House of Commons on November 24th. “1 should like to preface my statement today by thanking the Honourable Members in every part of the House for the patience and restraint with which they have watched growing each month the unhappy situation in Palestine. I know how easy it would have been for them to have badgered the Colonial Secretary at question time or to have drawn angry attention to this or that aspect of matters on motions for adjournment. But the Honour able Members have refrained from doing these things. It is not because they are indifferent to what is going on in Palestine. The House is conscious of its responsibilities in Palestine as it is of its responsibilities in any other part of the world. I think the Honour able Members have perhaps refrained from doing these things because they appreciate the special difficulties and delicacy of the situation with which we are faced in that country. I hope I may appeal to the Honourable Members this afternoon, when w r e are about to enter into discussions with representatives of the Arabs and Jews in London, to conduct this debate with such a wise judg ment that no word which is spoken here shall prejudice the chances of these discussions bearing at the last fruits of an Arab-Jewish agreement. Luring the last few T months a constructive political effort to ease the situation in Palestine has not been possible. It was un fortunate but inevitable. We had to wait for the presentation of the Woodhead Commission’s Report and so our attention has been concentrated on merely physical efforts to restore law and order in that country. Luring the idle summer days when there was little work for the labourers to do in the fields a campaign of assassination and violence waged by terrorists grew into some thing like an organised and widespread Arab revolt against British authority. The powerful military and police forces which are now at the disposal of the Government are steadily and surely re establishing the authority of the Government throughout the land. A few weeks ago they cleared the Old City of Jerusalem of rebels. The authority of the administration has been reestablished in Jaffa. Without any blowing of trumpets the Walls of Jericho have been re-occupied by our troops. Gaza is once more a place where the writ of Government runs and this week hostile elements have been driven out of Beersheba. Steadily and painfully the process of restoration is going on throughout the country. We all know that certain interested propagandists have been levelling many foul charges against the conduct of our troops. I see a good many things in the Colonial Office but I have never seen any evidence in support of these charges. On the contrary the whole world knows that the re-occupation of the Old City of Jerusalem a few weeks ago was an example of the way in which British Troops can with perfect humanity as well as perfect suc cess conduct a delicate military operation in the midst of a civilian population. But the real problem in Palestine is not a military problem but a political problem. Our troops can restore order; they cannot restore peace. The Government have to do that; this House has to do that. There is nothing so easy as to state the problem in Palestine. It was done brilliantly in the pages of the Report of the Peel Commission. There is no need to alter a word or a comma in the analysis of the problem as it is made in that remarkable State Document. Palestine is a tiny country; spiritually it is great. In its spiritual quality it has no peer among the countries of the earth; it guards some of the Hoi } 7 Places of the three great world religions. But physically it is tiny. Its soil is very fertile and bears rich fruits but much of the land is rocky or hilly and much of it is desert. That is the nature of the small stage on which a great tragedy is being played today. There are two protagonists in the field. First of all there are the Jews. Nearly 2000 years ago their home was Palestine but since then they have been dispersed, scattered over the face of the earth. They are a countryless people but during the last 20 years many of them have been hastening back to Palestine under the terms of the Mandate, endorsed by more than 50 nations, under which the administration of the country was entrusted to Great Britain. I do not think that anyone can justly say that during these years Great Britain has not been fulfilling her obligations to facilitate the immigration of Jews into Palestine. Since 1922 more than 250,000 Jews have entered Palestine and settled there. Their achievement has been remarkable. They have turned sand dunes into orange groves. They have pushed ever farther into the waste land of the frontier their cultivation and settlements. They have created a new city housing today 140,000 souls where before there was only bare sea-shore. There is no knowing where their achievements might end if Palestine were empty of any other population, and could be handed over to them in full ownership. The Jews are in Palestine not of sufferance but by right and today8 under the lasli of persecution in Central Europe their eagerness to return to their own homeland is multiplied one hundred-fold. The tragedy of a people who have no country has never been so deep as it is this week. The sympathies of our own countrymen, their anxiety to do everything they can to help the persecuted Jews has never been so firm as it is today. But I hope we are not going to allow our horror at the plight into which these people have been thrown to warp our cool and just judgment on the difficult problem of Palestine today. I must utter this word of warning. When we promised to facilitate the establishment of a National Home for the Jews in Palestine we never anticipated this fierce persecution in Europe. We.have made no promise that that country should be the Home for every one who is seeking to escape from such an immense calaniity and even if there were no other population in Palestine its rather meagre soil could not in fact support more than a frac tion of those Jews who may wish to escape from Europe. The problem of refugees in Central Europe cannot be settled in Pal estine. It has to be settled over a far wider field than that. Pal estine, of course, can make its contribution; it is making a con tribution today. At the present time despite the disturbances Jewish emigrants are going to Palestine week after week at the rate of about 1000 a month. The Jewish Agency naturally in the light of recent events are now T anxious that the rate of immigra tion should be greatly increased. I saw two representatives of the Agency on Monday and they spoke to me about it. I asked them to let me have their proposals complete in every detail. Those proposals reached me this morning and they will, of course, re ceive at once my most careful attention and I shall consult about them with the High Commissioner in Jerusalem. But I must in all the circumstances honestly say this; the Government have often been charged with having no policy in Palestine or else they have been charged with having a policy and then wobbling on it, changing their mind. The Government announced a short time ago what the next definite stage in its policy would be. That is a policy of discussion with the Arabs and the Jews in London and we are going to abide by that Conference. We cannot do anything now which might prejudice the chances of those dis cussions ending successfully. It is in the best interests of the Jews themselves that the future policy in Palestine should as far as possible be based on a wide agreement. The second people who are involved in this bitter controversy in Palestine are the Arabs. They have lived in the country for many centuries. They were not consulted when the Balfour Declaration was made nor when the Mandate was framed and during post-war years they have watched with occasional angry protests this peaceful invasion by an alien people. They have watched the buying up of their lands, they have watched the Jewish settle ments spread ever further over the countryside. They have been compelled to recognise the superior energy, skill and wealth of that wonderful people; and the Arabs are afraid. In 1933, 30,000 Jews came into Palestine; in 1934, l^OOO Jews came into Pal estine and in 1935 the number was 61,000. The Arabs wondered when a halt is going to be called to this great migration. They wondered whether a halt is ever going to be called to it and they fear it is going to be their fate in the land of their birth to be dominated by this energetic new people, dominating the econom ical, political and commercial spheres. If I were an Arab I would be alarmed. If we are ever to have an understanding of this problem, if we are ever to play our part in finding a happy solution for it we must be able to put ourselves in the shoes not only of the Jews but of the Arabs. I know a great many people regard this Arab agitation as a mere protest of a group of bandits. Of course it is true those Arabs who have taken part most eagerly in the troubles are cut- threats of the wnrst type. Their massacre of the innocent at Tiberias and on a score of other miserable battlefields has dis graced their cause. It is true also that many of those who are associated with them have been terrorised into that association. But there is much more than that in the Arab movement. I think this House, which is so capable of a generous understanding of other people, ought to recognise that many in the Palestinian Arab movement are moved by a genuine patriotism. However wrong they may be, however misguided they may be, however disastrous their policy may be, many of them have felt compelled to take the risk of laying down their lives for their country. I know T that that is not the whole story. There is a great deal else that has to be said if the description of the situation is to be complete and just. There is one set of facts especially of great importance that I must mention. Those who conceived 20 years ago the possibilities of facilitating the establishment of a Jewish National Home in Palestine were moved by a great idea and al ready in these first 20 years that idea has been translated into a wonderful act of creation. But I do sometimes wonder whether all of the authors of this great creative act were fully informed of the situation even at that time in 1917, 1918 and 1919. I some times wonder whether they knew then that there were already living between the Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea more than— 5 — 600.000 Arabs. Certainly I do not think they could know that as a result of the Jews and because of the coming of the Jews that the Arab population would increase rapidly. The Jews brought with them money and development works provided extra liveli hood. Modern health services, which were extended not only to Jews but to Arabs, gave individuals a further lease and security of life. Since 1922 the Arab population in Palestine lias, scarcely at all by migration from outside and almost entirely by natural increases, gone up from something over 600.000 to 990,000 per sons. Perhaps I should add that it is calculated that the total of 990.000 Arabs in Palestine today will have become 1,500,000 Arabs within 20 years from now. That remarkable and significant set of facts leads to two reflec tions. In the first place I think it must upset at any rate some of the calculations of about how many Jews could be settled in Pal estine without prejudicing the rights and positions of the Arab population. But as I say there are two sides to that state of things. The other side is this : the Arabs cannot say that the Jews are driving them out of the country. If not a single Jew had come to Palestine after 1918 I believe the Arab population of Palestine today would still have been round about the 600,000 figure at which it had been stable under Turkish rule. It is be cause the Jews who come to Palestine bring the modern health services and other advantages that the Arab man and woman, who would have been dead, are alive today, that the Arab children who would never have drawn breath have been born and grown strong. It is not only the Jews who have benefitted from the Balfour Declaration. They can deny it as much as they like but naturally the Arabs in Palestine have gained very greatly from the Balfour Declaration. I know it is useless to press that argument on the Arabs. They are deaf to the argument, they are blind to the spectacle of a gradually improving standard of life for their people because they are thinking of something else. They are thinking of their freedom and they are afraid that if this process goes on then at last they will have to surrender to the political overlordship of the enterprising, hardworking, ever increasing- citizens of the Jewish National Home. I say that we British people ought to be the last people in the world not to understand the feelings of the Arabs in this matter, because we too would sacrifice the material advantages if we thought that our freedom was at stake. We cannot put the Jews under the domination of the Arabs in Palestine, but unless we can remove that Arab fear that they are going to be put under the domination of the Jews, we shall have to face a suspicious and hostile people over a great area of the Near East and we shall find that we have to lock up— (j a great part of our Army in Palestine indefinitely. Therefore we have the most solemn obligations to both peoples in Palestine. On the opposite side we are pledged to facilitate Jewish immigration into Palestine under suitable conditions and to encourage close settlement of the Jews on the land, and on the other hand we are pledged to see that the rights and positions of the Arab population are not prejudiced. How can we reconcile justly and peacefully those two obligations ? That is the problem we have to solve. That is the riddle for which we have to find an answer. The Peel Commission with irresistible logic recommended that the country should be partitioned, that the Jews and the Arabs should be to a certain extent kept apart, that the ambitions of each of them to enjoy self-government should be satisfied in different areas of Palestine, while the Holy Places were kept in an enclave still under Mandatory control. This House never committed itself to that policy. The Government accepted it in principle as the most hopeful solution to the deadlock which had arisen but admittedly the practicability of the principle had to be further investigated and the Woodhead Commission went out for that purpose to Pal estine. For three months they lived dangerously in the City of Jerusalem, they toured the whole country always with their escort of armed men, they went about their business with great courage and they went about it also with great thoroughness. A short while ago they presented their report. That report makes it clear that partition as proposed by the Peel Commission is impractic able. That report makes it clear that if we were to divide Pal estine into a Jewish State and an Arab State and a Mandated area then the Jewish State would have a great surplus in its budget every year, but year after year the budgets of the Arab State and the Mandated territory would show a great deficit. The Commission reported that under the terms of their reference they were unable to recommend boundaries for the proposed areas which would afford a reasonable prospect of the eventual establish ment of self-supporting Arab and Jewish States. 1 think that is itself a remarkable tribute to the achievements of the Jews. It is impossible without the continuous aid of the Jews for the peoples living in Palestine beyond the Jewish settlements to main tain the standard of Government and social services to which they have become accustomed. That state of affairs also kills the pro posal for the dividing up of Palestine into two sovereign States and His Majesty’s Government lost no time in accepting that position. A part of Palestine is not to be handed over to control by the Jews, another part is not to be handed over to control by the Arabs; Government have declared they will continue their responsibilities for the Government of the whole country. We have adopted, if I may say so, a motto, a policy, which my FightHonourable friend the Member for Epping (Mr. Churchill) said he would make a present of to me when I met him in the Lobby shortly after 1 had assumed office as Colonial Secretary. He muttered to me as he passed one afternoon “not partition but perseverance”. We have to find alternative means of meeting the needs of this unhappy situation in Palestine. I receive a great deal of help in my study of the problem from numbers of correspondents. Scores of letters pour in, many of them containing solutions to this problem. I do not remember any two letters which sug gested exactly the same solution. Many of the letters offer no solution at all; their writers merely crying in desperation “Is there any solution to this appalling problem ?. Of course there is a solution but I do not think it ought to rest on the Govern ment alone to find that solution. It ought to rest also on the two other parties who are concerned in this matter, the Arabs and the Jews. They have both got a contribution to make; they have both got to make concessions to the other. If they would only be willing to do that then peace and prosperity would return to both peoples in Palestine. I know it is going to be exceedinglv difficult to break down the hard bitterness which has naturally grown up on each side during the months of violence and blood shed. It may be that one’s idealism is running away with one in supposing that any agreement is possible at the present time. Put the Government attaches so much importance to an under standing between the Jews and the Arabs that they are prepared to make a supreme effort to achieve that understandi-ng. It is not impossible for the ordinary Jewish and Arab people to live con- tentedly side by side in Palestine. Many of them have been doing so in numbers of communities in Palestine right throughout these distressing times. Nor is it impossible for the Jews’ and Arabs’ leaders to reach agreement together. There was a moment 20 years ago when that not only seemed a possibility but seemed to have been actually accomplished. Doctor Weizmann on behalf ol the Zionist Organisation crossed the River Jordan and met the Emir Feisal in his camp in the desert surrounded by his Arab hosts and in due course after some months those two men signed an agreement about Palestine. It is that sort of relationship between Arab and Jew that we want to go back to. So the Gov ernment have proposed that discussions should take place in London. Ihe_y will probably be in the first instance discussions between the Government and the Arab representatives and dis cussions between the Government and the Jewish representatives, but we hope they will develop before long into discussions between all three parties meeting round a common table. The Government will, of course, enter the discussions bound by its obliga tions under the Mandate to the Jews and to the Arabs, bound by its . duty to Parliament and to the other members of the League of Nations and to the United States of America but we shall not seek to prevent either the Arab representatives or the Jewish re presentatives from offering arguments as to why the Mandate should be changed. The discussions will be full and frank and therefore I am sure that the House will not expect me to say more at this stage about the policy which the Government itself will follow in the course of those discussions. I hope it will be pos sible for the discussions to start in London within the next few weeks. If they cannot start before Christmas I hope they will start at very latest at the beginning of January for it is imperat ive that the position of uncertainty shall be brought to an end as soon as possible. It is of the greatest importance that the policy should be formulated and clearly declared. For that reason if the discussions in London do not yield some kind of understand ing between the three parties within a reasonable time, than the Government will itself take full privilege in the light of its examination of the question following the Peel and Woodhead reports, and in the light of the discussions themselves, for for mulating and declaring the future policy. The Honourable Members in the House in these days have to deal with a great variety of political problems. Each day they crowd upon us but I always feel conscious that there is someting about Palestine which distinguishes its problem from any other. The others are essays in the art of Government — the most difficult of all arts. When I attempt to deal with them I natur ally, like other Honourable Members, feel a lively human in terest and even fascination in them. In possession of those qualities this Palestine problem yields nothing to any other. Its complexity makes it the supreme test of our capabilities to govern. But there is more to it than that. When I turn to the Palestine problem 1 feel an awe and reverence. I cannot remember a time when I did not hear about Palestine. I cannot remember a time when I was not told stories about Nazareth, Galilee, Jerusalem and Bethlehem where was born the Prince of Peace. This House in its long history has had placed in its keeping many noble trusts but it has never had a trust so sacred as that of restoring peace and goodwill in the Holy Land.”No C/742-1, a/42 • • The Political Agent, Bahrain, Presents his compliments to: — The Adviser to the Bahrain Govermnentj BAHRAIN, and has the honour to send him t [j e undermentioned document ( s ) for favour of distribution. , The Agency, BAHKAIN, Persian Gulf.

You should explain to His Excellency that as Iraqi and Saudi Arabian delegates are understood now to have left Cairo and as mes sage in your telegram under reference came from them as well as Egyptian Prime Minister steps are being taken by His Majesty’s Representatives to communicate this memorandum si milarly to competent Iraqi and Saudi Arabian authorities. But since Iraqi Prime Minister and Ibn Saud may not be fully informed of course of discussions in Cairo or of previous correspondence referred to it might be well if Egyptian Prime Minister felt able to send to Iraqi and Saudi Arabian Govern ments telegram containing such further e xplanations as he may consider desirable. 2. You should further remind Prime Minister that memoran dum must for the present be regarded as most secret and it is very important that there should be no leakage. 3. Memorandum begins : His Majesty's Government are glad to note that after the representatives of Egypt Iraq and Saudi Arabia had examined the proposals concerning Palestine contained in the last two communications handed by the British Ambassador Cairo/-(2)/- - 2 - Cairo to His Excellency the President of the Council of Ministers of Egypt they were of opinion they could advise Palestinians to co-operate in the establishment of an independent Palestinian State on the basis of the negotiations which took place in Lon don and contents of the two communications referred to. With reference however to the three points to which attention is called in the message from these representatives His Majesty's Government wish to state their understanding of the position as left by the negotiations which took place in London and by the two communications referred to as follows. (1) Position regarding appointment of Palestinians to depart ments of the present administration in Palestine was made c lear in the relevant paragraph of the memorandum which was communi cated by the British Ambassador to His Excellency the President of the Council of Ministers of Egypt on April 7th, and to which representatives of Egypt Iraq and Saudi Arabia informed His Majesty's Ambassador that they agreed on April 9th. As explained in memorandum it is proposed as soon as peace and security have been sufficiently restored in Palestine that a certain numoer of departments would be placed in charge of Palestinians with British Advisers and that this process should be extended during the transitional period until all Heads of departments were Palestinians. Palestinian Heads of departments would exercise administrative and advisory functions which are at present oer- would sit (?) formed by British officials and they control sitting on Executive Council which advises the High Commissioner. When Palestinians were in charge of all departments, consideration would be given to question of converting Executive Council into a Council of Ministers with consequential change in status and functions of Palestinian Heads of departments. It is not proposed there fore that there should be a Ministry of Palestinians immediately after the restoration of peace and security but His Majesty's Government will make as rapid progress as circumstances permit with progressive appointment of Palestinians to be in charge of departments.-3- (2) With regard to immigration figure 75000 Jewish immigrants within next five years was arrived at on basis of best local statistics available as being figure required totring total Jewish population up to approximately one third of total popu lation at the end of period. It has sometimes been suggested that there should be a special census for determining the exact population figures. His Majesty's Government have already considered this suggestion and they would have been inclined to accept it if they had felt it to be practicable; but they have been forced to c onclude that practical difficulties must rule it out. Such a census would probably lose much of its value owint to natural incentive of both Jews and Arabs to secure under-estimate of their numbers. In any case regular decennial census is due in 1941 but even if it were to show that present estimates are to some extent inaccurate with result that Jewish population would in five years time be rather more or rather less than one third of total population His Majesty* s Government feel it would be very unwise to allow it to be supposed in Palestine that therevould be a chance of figure 75000 being altered on that account. Apart from the fact that the first result of allowing Palestinian Arabs and Jews to believe that it might be so altered would be to destroy accuracy of 1941 census there is advantage in leaving no uncertainty as to what the maximum figure of immigrants will be. It will be appreciat ed that 75000 is a maximum figure in sense that if during the five years* period economic absorptive capacity is inadequate that figure may not be reached. His Majesty's Government appreciate the Palestinian Arabs' anxiety about possibility in future of Jewish illegal immigration and in their manifesto of policy His Majesty's Government intend reaffirming their determination to do everything in their power to check this immigration and their intention to deduct the number of such illegal immigrants as may despite the firm measures to b e taken succeed in settling in Palestine from numbers of legal immigrants/--4- immigrants to be admitted. In this connection I am communi cating to Egyptian Iraqi and Saudi Arabian Governments copies of announcements which were made by the Secretary of State for the Colonies in the House of Commons last week. (3) With regard to the sale of land it is intended that the High Commissioner shall consult Palestinian representa tives on the Executive Council on questions conerning sale of lands before decisions are reached.

You may communicate memorandum informally to Ibn Saud with a covering communication on the following lines explaining that both documents should be regarded as most secret at present state since His Majesty’s Government are very anxious that there should be no leakage in the press before they have published forthcoming White Paper stating their future policy in Palestine. The Egyptian Prime Minister handed to the British Ambassador in Cairo an official communication on April 30th being a memorandum regarding Palestine, showing the con clusions reached as a result of the discussions in Cairo between representatives of Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Egypt. His Majesty’s Government have now considered terms of this document, of which His Hoyal Highness the Amir Feisal no doubt possesses a copy. They understand in fact that it represented a message from Saudi Arabian and Iraqi delegates as well as from Egyptian Prime Minister. His Majesty's Government wish to transmit to His Majesty King Abdul Aziz the accompanying reply to the points raised in that memo randum. They would explain that reply is also being commu nicated to the Prime Ministers of Egypt and Iraq. Message begins His/-- ” ' — - 2 - His Majesty* s Government desire to take this opportunity to express to His Majesty their appreciation of assistance which His Royal Highness the Amir Feisal rendered to them during the Palestine Conferences in London. The friendly courtesy and marked ability displayed by His Royal Highness greatly eased difficulties which inevitably occurred in the course of discussions and if as all who participated in the Conferences must hope the way now lies open towards re-esta blishment of peace and order in Palestine a considerable part of the credit will be due to Saudi Arabian delegates. His Majesty* s Government hope to publish shortly their final and complete decisions regarding Palestine in the fbrm of a document to be laid before Parliament. They are not yet able to state the exact date when this document will be pub lished, but they expect the full text to be ready in about a week's time. They would like, if His Majesty's movements permit, to arrange that he should have for his own confidential information the more Important passages in this document in advance of publication. It is their hope andb elief that this document will form the basis for the re-establishment of peace in Palestine, especially if His Majesty King Abdul Aziz and the Governments of Egypt and Iraq feel themselves able to use their great influence with the Palestine Arabs in the interests of peace. His Majesty's Government recognise that under their new decisions Palestine Arabs will not obtain everything which they demanded at the London Conferences. His Majesty will however appreciate that the British proposals will entirely remove the mbst important grievances of the Palestine Arabs. They remove fear of political domination by the Jews by declaring categorically that it is not the intention of His Majesty's Government that Palestine shall become a Jewish State. They remove fear of Jewish immigration continuing indefinitely regardless of the Arabs' feelings by imposing severe limitations on Jewish immigration during the next five years and by providing a'ter those five years that there shall■ be no further Jewish immigration without the acquiescence of the Arabs. And they contain important constitutional provisions by which the people of Palestine will be able in due course to achieve their independence. On the specific points mentioned in the annexed reply to the Cairo memorandum of April 30th His Majesty will no doubt be able to obtain any necessary ocolanations from His Royal Highness the Amir Feisal; and His Majesty's Government need therefore only offer the following brief comments. (1) British Ambassador Cairo was informed on April 9th that representatives of Saudi Arabia Iraq and Egypt agreed to suggestions which His Majesty's Government had made regarding aopointment of Palestinians to charge of departments of the administration in Palestine. His Majesty's Government intend to embody these sug -estions in a White Paper declaring their policy. (2) His Majesty's Government think it best to fix now a final immigration figure of 75000 (subject to economic absorp tive capacity) during next five years. This figure has been worked out on basis of existing estimates of population and clearly it may not bring Jewish population up to exactly one third of total population. It is only possible to work for approximate proportions. Actual proportion in five years time may be rather more or rather less than one third. A census held for the purpose of securing a more exact calcula tion would probably fail to effect this object. r is Majesty's Government feel it would be wrong to allow the population of Palestine to believe that immigration figure might be changed for they are convinced this would only lead to further un certainty and much bitterness and unprofitable controversy. (3) It is intended that there should in future be full consultation between the High Commissioner and Palestinian heads of depa- tments on the Executive Council before deci sions are taken on question of sale of lands. One object of putting/-putting Palestinians on the Executive Council is that they may advise on such matters to this effect. But the ultimate decision in such matters will lie with the High Commissioner. of the Arabs that within the next three years after peace and order have been restored a constituent assembly will be formed for the purpose of drawing up a constitution. His Majesty's Governments proposals on this point are that at the end of of the constitutional arrangements during the transitional period and to consider • nd make recommendations regarding the constitution of the independent Palestine State. Tt may eventually be thought best that the first draft of the new constitution should be drawn up by a special body including experts (as as done in the case of Egypt) and that the docu ments drawn up by them should then be laid before a constituent assembly. British delegates gained the impression during their conversations with delegates of neighbouring states following the London Conferences that latter regarded this time-table and procedure as offering a possible solution. His Majesty's Government trust that the annexed reply together with the foregoing explanations will give His Majesty King Abdul Aziz sufficient explanation of their views. If however there is any point upon which further intormation is required they will be happy to provide it to the best of their ability. They wish to keep His Majesty in future informed of the position and of their views regarding the Palestine problem And they continue as always to attach the greatest importance to the friendly interest and help of His Majesty in this matter.

Begins. His Majesty’s Government have just received by tele graph through Sir Reader Bullard a massage from His Majesty King Abdul Aziz stating that His Royal Highness the Amir « Feisal and Jemal Husseini are with him now in order to dis cuss question of Palestine, but that no progress can be made before His Majesty's Government's reply to the Egyptian Prime Minister is received. Reply of His Majesty's Government to the Egyptian Prime Minister's memorandum of April 30th is being communi cated to His Majesty separately. His Majesty's Government are anxious that this reply should be regarded by His Majesty as a secret document which may of course be shown to His Royal Highness the Amir Feisal but not to other parties. His Majesty's Government note that His Majesty intends to discuss the Palestine problem with Jemal Husseini. They think well therefore to ocplain their own oosition which they have maintained throughout the informal discussions which have taken place with the representatives of the Governments of Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Egypt in London and in Cairo since the London Conference came to and end. Before summoning the/-- 2 - the Conference His Majesty's Government had assured Par liament that if attempt to reach agreement at the Conference failed they would on their own responsibility announce their future policy regarding Palestine. Prior to reaching deci sions on details of that policy His Majesty's Government have however welcomed opportunity of informal discussions with representatives of the three States with a view t o considering certain suggestions which those representatives wished to make. But these discussions have not involved any renewed negotiations which came to an end when the Conference closed. As a result of informal discussions His Majesty's Government are prepared to modify their proposed oolicy in certain respects and they believe the proposals which they now contemplate (beyond which they cannot go) are reasona ble and just. They go a long way to meet Arab case and should in the view of His Majesty's Government form a basis on which peace can be restored in Palestine. As His Koyal Highness the Amir Feisal will appreciate, this position was fully exolained to the Egyptian Prime Minister and representatives of other States in Cairo. His Majesty's Government were not parties to invitation to Palestine leaders to come to Cairo for further discussions. They of course welcome any initiative which His Majesty or any neighbouring States may wish to take on their own res ponsibility with a view to helping in restoration of peace in Palestine. But they feel sure that in any discussions that he may have with Jemal Husseini His Majesty will keep in mind the position of His Majesty's Government as des cribed above.

And they continue, as always, to attach the greatest importance to the friendly interest and help of Your Majesty in this matter* I have the honour to be, Your Majesty, Your Majesty's most obedient servant, Political Agent, Bahrain.THE MEMORANDUM RECORDED BY HIS MAJESTY’S -g Q Ys g Mr His Majesty*s Government are glad to note that after the representatives of Sgypt f Iraq* and Saudi Arabia had examined the proposals concerning Palestine contained in the last two communications handed by the British Ambassador, Cairo, to His the Excellency the President ofCouncil of Ministers of Egypt, they were of opinion they could advise Palestinians to co-operate in the establishment of an independent Palestinian State on the basis of the negotiations which took place in London, and of the contents of the two communications referred to* With reference however to the three points to which attention is called in the message from these representatives, His Majesty*© Government wish to state their understanding of the position as it has been left by the negotiations which took place in London and by the two communications referred to as follows f (1) The position regarding the appointment of Palestinians to departments of the present administration in Palestine was made clear in the relevant paragraph of the memorandum which was communicated by the British Ambassador in Cairo to His Excellency the President of the Council of Ministers of Egypt the on April 7th, and to which&gt;epresentatlves of Egypt, Iraq and Saudi Arabia informed His Majesty*s Ambassador that they agreed on April 9th. As explained in that memorandum it is proposed, as soon as peace and security have been sufficiently restored in Palestine, that a certain number of departments would be placed in charge of Palestinians with British Advisers, and that this process should be extended during the transitional period until all Heads of departments were Palestinians. Palestinian Heads of departments would exercise administrative and advisory functions which are at present performed by British officials/-•* 2 «» officials, and they would sit on the Executive Council which advises the High Commissioner. When Palestinians were in charge of all departments consideration would be given to the question of converting the Executive Council into a Council of Ministers with consequential change in status and functions of Palestinian Heads of departments. It is not proposed therefore that there should be a Ministry of Palestinians immediately after the restoration of peace and security, but His Majesty*s Government will make as rapid progress as circumstances permit, with progressive appointment of Palestinians to he in charge of departments. (2) With regard to immigration the figure of 75,000 Jewish immigrants within the next five years was arrived at on the basis of the best local statistics available as being the figure required to bring the total Jewish population up to approximately one third of the total population at the end of this period. It has sometimes been suggested that there should be a special census for determining the exact population figures. His Majesty*s Government have already considered this suggestion and they would have been inclined to accept it if they had felt it to be practicable; but they have been forced to conclude that practical difficulties must rule it out. Such a census would probably lose much of its value owing to the natural incentive of both Jews and Arabs to secure an under-estimate of their numbers. In any case the regular decennial census is due in 1941, but even if it were to show that the present estimates are to some extent inaccurate , with the result that the Jewish population would in five years* time be rather more or rather less than one third of the total population, His Majesty*s Government feel it would be very unwise to allow it to be supposed in Palestine that there would be a chance of the figure 75,000 being altered /-altered on that account. Apart from the fact that the first result of allowing Palestinian Arabs and Jews to believe that it might be so altered would be to destroy the accuracy of the 1941 census, there is advantage in leaving no uncertainty as to what the maximum figure of immigrants will be# It will be appreciated that 75,000 is a maximum figure in the sense that if during the five years 1 period economic absorptive capacity is inadequate, that figure may not be reached. His Majesty^ Government appreciate the Palestinian Arabs’ anxiety about the possibility in future of Jewish illegal immigration, and in their manifesto of policy His Majesty’s Government intend re affirming their determination to do everything in their power to check this immigration and their intention to deduct the number of such illegal immigrants as may, despite the firm measures to be taken, succeed in settling in Palestine from the numbers of legal immigrants to be admitted. In this connection His Majesty’s Government are communicating to the Egyptian, Iraqi and Saudi Arabian Governments copies of the announcements which were made by the Secretary of State for the Colonies in the House of Commons last week. (3) With regard to the sale of land, it is intended that the High Commissioner shall consult Palestinian representatives on the Executive Council on questions concerning the sale of lands before decisions are reached.*Dated the 6th May 1939. To His Majesty King *bdul Aziz Ibn Saud, King of Saudi Arabia. Your Majesty, I have been instructed by His Majesty's Government to deliver to Your Majesty the following further message in continuation of the communication which I have handed to Your Majesty in regard to Palestine. Ris Majesty's Government have just received by tele graph through Sir Reader Bullard a message from Your Majesty stating that His Royal Highness the Amir Feisal and Shaikh Jemal Husaaini are with you 'now in order to discuss the question of Palestine, but that no progress can be made before His Majesty's Government's reply to the Egyptian Prime Minister is received. The reply of His Majesty's Government to the Egyptian Prime Minister* s memorandum of April 30th has been communi cated to Your Majesty separately. His Majesty's Government are anxious that this reply should be regarded by Your Majesty as a secret document, which may of course be shown to His Royal Highness the Amir Feisal but not to other parties. His Majesty's Government note that Your Majesty had intended to discuss the Palestine problem with Shaikh Jemal Husseini. They think it would be well therefore to explain their own position which they have maintained throughout the informal discussions which have taken place with the rep resentatives of the Governments of Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Kgypt /-- 2 - X @ Egypt both in London and in Cairo since the London Conference came to an end. Before summoning the Conference His Majesty's Government had assured Parliament that if the attempt to reach an agreement at the Conference failed they would on their own responsibility announce their future policy regarding Palestine.

As a result of the informal discussions His Majesty's Government are prepared to modify their proposed policy in certain respects, and they believe that the proposals which they now contemplate (and beyond which they cannot go) are reasonable and just. They go a long way to meet the Arab case and should in the view of His Majesty's Government form a basis on which peace can be restored in Palestine. As His Hoyal Highness the Amir Feisal will appreciate, this position was fully explained to the Egyptian Prime Minis ter and to the representatives of the other States in Cairo. His Majesty's Government were not parties to the invitation to the Palestine leaders to come to Cairo for further dis cussions. They of course welcome any initiative which Your Majesty or any neighbouring States may wish to take on your own responsibility with a view to helping in the restoration of peace in Palestine. But they feel sure that in any dis cussions that you may have with Shaikh Jemal Husseini Your Majesty will keep in mind the position of His Majesty's Government as described above.

The letter reads as follows :- 'I have received your letter dated the 9th May 1939 and the accompanying memorandum* and I request you to inform the British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of my great pleasure at and appreciation of the good spirit he has dis played in regard to the Palestine problem. I hope that this matter will reach a friendly conclusion, and that peace and order will be restored in that quarter. I have received from my son Feisal details of the discussions which took place in Cairo between the representatives of the neighbouring Arab countries. I note that the British Government in their recent communication did not agree to the comments and explanations which were put forward by the representatives on the 30th of April last; and in these circumstances the Palestine leaders may not be ready to accept the British proposals or to co-operate /-co-operate in giving effect to the policy which the British Goverrunent intend to announce in the near future* There is no doubt that there are many good points in the new proposals but they do not fully meet the demands of the people of Palestine in regard to (their points about) the constitution^ immigration and the sale of lands. Nevertheless I do not cease to study these proposals closely and 1 am eagerly await ing the issue of the V^hite Paper so that I may conclude my studies. But at the present juncture I hope that the British Government will show greater generosity in meeting the funda mental desiderata which were put before them at Cairo; and certainly that would lighten my task in influencing the Palestinian leaders to accept my advice.

Instructions are being telegraphed to you separately. Begins. I. Constitution . (i) Objective of His Majesty's Government is establish ment within ten years of an independent Palestine State in such treaty relations with United Kingdom as will provide satisfactorily for commercial and strategical requirements of both countries in future. This proposal for establishment of independent State would involve consultation with the Council of the League of Nations with a view to termination of mandate. (ii) Independent State should be one in which Arabs and Jews share in Government in such a way as to ensure that essential interests of each community are safeguarded. (iii) Establishment of independent State will be preceded by a transitional period throughout v/hich His Majesty's Government will retain responsibility for Government of country. During transitional period the peoole of Palestine will be given an increasing part in Government of their country. Both sections of pooulation will have an opportu nity of participation in machinery of Government and process will be carried on whether or not they both avail themselves of It (iv) As soon as peace and order have been sufficiently restored in Palestine seeps will be taken to carry out this(vii)/- - 2 - policy of giving people of Palestine an increasing part in the Government of their country the objective being to place Palestinians in charge of all departments of Government with assistance of British advisers and subject to Plans of High Commissioner. With this object in view His Hajesty*s Govern ment will be prepared immediately to arrange that Palestinians shall be placed in charge of certain departments with British advisers. Palestinian Heads of Departments will sit on the Executive Council of High Commissioner which advises High Commissioner. Arab and Jewish representatives will be invited to serve as Heads of Departments approximately in proportion to their respective populations. Number of Palestinians in charge of departments will be increased as circumstances permit until all Heads of Departments are Palestinians. Exercising administrative and advisory functions which are at present performed by British officials. When that stage is reached consideration will be given to question of converting Executive Council into a Council of Ministers with a consequential change in status and functions of Palestinian Heads of Departments. (v) His Majesty’s Government make no proposals at this stage regarding the establishment of an elective legislature. Nevertheless they would regard this as a&gt;* should public opinion in Palestine hereafter show itself infavour of such a development, they will institute it provided local conditions permit establishment of necessary machinery. (vi) At the end of five years from the restoration of peace and order anappropriate body of representatives of people of Palestine and of His Majesty's Government willb e set to review working of constitutional arrangements during transitional period and to consider and make recommendations regarding constitution of independent Palestinian Dtate.II/- -3 (vii) His Majesty's Government will require to be satis fied that in treaty contemplated in sub-paragraph (i) or in constitution contemplated in sub-paragraph (vi) adequate provision has been made for: (a) security and freedom of access to holy places and protection of interests and property of various religious bodies; (b) protection of different communities in Palestine in accordance with obligations of His Majesty^ Government to both Arabs and Jews and for special 'osition in Palestine of Jewish National Home; t (c) such requirements to meet strategical situation as may be regarded as necessar*y by His Majesty's Government in the light of the circumstances then existing. His Majesty's Government will also require to be satisfied that interests of certain foreign countries in Palestine for preservation of which they are at present responsible are adequately safeguarded. (viii) His Majesty's Government will do everything in their power to create conditions which will enable inde pendent Palestine State to come into being within ten years; but if circumstances then prevailing require postponement of establishment of independent State they w ? ill consult representatives of people of Palestine the Council of the League and neighbouring Arab States before deciding on such a postponement. If His Majesty's Government come to con clusion postponement is unavoidable they will invite co-opera tion of these parties in framing nlans for future with a view to achieving desired objective at the earliest possible moment. During transitional period steps will be taken to increase powers and responsibilities of municipal corpora tions and local councils.II. Immigration Ci) Jewish immigration during next five years will be at a rate which if economic absorptive capacity permits will bring Jewish population up to approximately one-third of total population of country. Taking into account expected natural increase of Arab and Jewish populations and number of illegal Jewish immigrants now in country this would allow of admission as from beginning of April this year of some 75000 immigrants over next five years. These immigrants would subject to criterion of economic absorptive capacity be admitted as follows: (a) For each of next five years a quota of 10000 Jewish immigrants will be allowed on the understanding a shortage in any one year may be added to quotas of sstibsequent years within five year period if economic absorptive capacity permits. (b) In addition as a contribution towards solution of Jewish refugee problem 25000 refugees will be admitted as soon as High Commissidner is satisfied that adequate pro vision for their maintenance is ensured, special consideration being given to refugee children and dependants. (ii) Existing machinery for ascertaining economic absorp tive capacity will be retained and High Commissioner will have ultimate responsibility of deciding limits of economic capa city. Before each periodic decision is taken Jewish and Arab representatives will be consulted. (iii) After period of five years no further Jewish immigra tion will be permitted unless Arabs of Palestine are prepared to acquiesce in it. (iv) His Majesty's Government are determined to check illegal immigration and further preventive measures are being adopted. Numbers of any Jewish illegal immigrants who despite these measures may succeed in coming into country5- and cannot be deported will be deducted from yearly quotas III. Land . High Commissioner will be given general powers to pro hibit and regulate sales of land. These oowers will date from publication of this statement of policy and High Commissioner will retain them throughout transition. Policy of Government will be directed towards develop ment of land and improvement wh '-ve possible of methods of cultivation. In the light of such development it willfbe open to High Commissioner should he be satisfied that 'rights and interests'of Arab population will be duly preserved, to review and modify any orders passed relating to prohibition or transfer of land. 3nds - Secretary of Seate for Foreign Affairs -Telegram Inter.

His Majesty’s Government have received message from His Majesty King Abdul Aziz regarding their future policy in Palestine. They would explain that they quite realise that their decisions do not meet all demands of 0 ** Palestine Arabs. They have for some time recognised with regret members of Palestine Arab Delegation who took part in London Conference would not regard their present deci sions as entirely satisfactory . His Majesty will apprecia te that in political matters of this kind no party is ever likely/-— £. — — im - 2 - likely to obtain full satisfaction of its demands. Nevertheless His Majesty’s Government have largely as a result of tripartite with representatives of neighbouring States during conference and afterwards made concessions which they believe to be of a very substantial nature to Arab point of view. They had hoped when representatives of neighbouring States in Cairo expressed agreement in principle with His Majesty’s Government’s latest proposals their governments would also be prepared to regard the present solution as reasonable and just. His Majesty's Government intend to issue their White Paper regarding Palestine on the evening of Wednesday May 17th for broadcast that evening and publication in morning newsoapers of May 18th. Decisions which they have reached regarding their future policy in Palestine are c ontained in accompanying ex tracts from forthcoming declaration. White Paper will also contain a lengthy statement of reasons w ich have led His Majesty's Government to reach these decisions. His Majesty's Government are glad to note that His Majes ty King Abdul Aziz, with his customary good will and isdom of statesmanship is anxious in principle to advise leaders of Palestine in direction of moderation and they aooreciate His Majesty's hope that he may be given some further material which v/ould enable him to approach Palestine Leaders with greater prospects of success. It may perhaps be of assistance to His Majesty to know although this should not be divulged until White Paper is published on May 18th that explanatory paragraphs of that document will in fact contain some material which may be helpful to him. For example one passage containsjstatement that His Majesty’s Government declare unequivocally that it is not part of His Majesty's Government’s policy that Palestine should become a Jewish State. Document proceeds to explain that His Majesty's Government would regard it as contrary to theirtheir obligations to Arabs under Mandate as well as to assurances which have been given to Arab people in past that Arab population of Palestine should be made subjects of a Jewish State against their will. Another passage in White Paper contains very important declaration by His Majesty's Government on immigration question and on their obligations towards Jewish National Home. It declares that His Majesty's Government are satisfied that when the immigration programme of five years which is now contemplated has taken place they will not be justified in facilitating nor will they be under any obligation to facilitate establishment of Jewish National Home by further immigration regardless of wishes of Arab population. If His Majesty after studying information now com municated to him in advance regarding contents of fo^th-r coming White Paper should feel able to use his great influence with Arab world to ensure favourable reception of these new decisions it is certain that population of Palestine will benefit all the sooner from the restoration of normal conditions.

CONSTITUTION , (i) The objective of His Majesty’s Government is the establishment within ten years of an independent Palestine State in such treaty relations with the United Kingdom as will provide satisfactorily for the commercial and strategic requirements of both countries in the future* This proposal for the establishment of an independent State would involve consultation with the Council of the League of Nations with a view to the termination of the Mandate* (ii) The independent State should be one in which Arabs and Jews share in the Government in such a way as to ensure that the essential interests of each community are safeguarded* (iii) The establishment of the independent State will be preceded by a transitional period throughout which His Majes ty’s Government will retain responsibility for the Government of the country. During the transitional period the people of Palestine will be given an increasing part in the Government of their country* Both sections of the population will have an opportunity to participate in the machinery of Government and the orocess will be carried on whether or not they both avail themselves of it. (iv) As soon as peace and order have been sufficiently restored in Palestine steps will be taken to carry out tnis policy of giving the people of Palestine an increasing part in the Government of their countryj the objective oeing to place Palestinians in charge of all departments of Government with the assistance of British Advisers, and subject to the control of the High Commissioner. With this object in view His Majesty’s Government will be prepared immediately to arrange /-arrange that Palestinians should be placed in charge of certain departments with British Advisers* Palestinian Heads of Departments will sit on the Executive Council which advises the High Commissioner* Arab and Jewish representatives will be invited to serve as Heads of Departments approximately in proportion to their respective populations* The number of Palestinians in charge of depart ments will be increased as circumstances permit until all Heads of Departments are Palestinians exercising administrative and advisory functions which are at present performed by Bri tish officials. When that stage is reached consideration will be given to the question of converting the Executive Council into a Council of Ministers with a consequential change in the status and functions of the Palestinian Heads of Departments* (v) His Majesty’s Government make no proposals at this stage regarding the establishment of an elective legislature* Nevertheless they will regard this as an appropriate consti tutional development and 9 should public opinion in Ialestine hereafter show itself in favour of such a development! they will institute it provided local conditions permit the establishment of the necessary machinery* (vi) At the end of five years from the restoration of peace and order an appropriate body of representatives of the people of Palestine and of His Majesty’s Government will be set to review' the working of the constitutional arrangements during the transitional period and to consider and make recom mendations regarding the constitution of an independent Pales tine State* (vii) His Majesty’s Government will require to be satisfied that in the Treaty contemplated in sub-paragraph (i) or in the Constitution contemplated in sub-paragraph (vi) adequate pro vision has been made for s(&amp;; security and freedom of access to the holy places and protection of interests and property of the various religious bodies; (b) protection of the different communities in Palestine in accordance with the obligations of His Majesty's Government to both Arabs and Jews, and for the special position in Palestine of the Jewish National Home; (c) such requirements to meet strategical situation as may be regarded as necessary by His Majesty's Government in the light of the circumstances then existing* His Majesty's Government will also require to be satis fied that the interests of certain foreign communities in Palestine for the preservation of which they are at present responsible are adequately safeguarded. (viii) His Majesty's Government will do everything in their power to create conditions which will enable an independent Palestine State to come into being within ten years; but if at the end of ten years it aopears to His Majesty's Government that circumstances then prevailing require the postponement of the establishment of an independent State, they will consult representatives of the people of Palestine, the Council of the League of Nations, and the neighbouring states before deciding on such a postponement. If His Majesty's Government come to the conclusion that postponement is unavoidable they will invite the co-operation of these parties in framing plans for the future with a view to achieving the desired objective at the earliest possible moment. During the transitional period steps will be taken to increase the powers and responsibilities of municipal corporations and local councils.(iv)/- -4- II. I^ I ORATION (i) Jewish iramigration during the next five years will be at a rate which, if economic absorptive capacity permits, will bring the Jewish population up to approximately one - third of the total population of the country. Taking into account the expected natural increase of Arab and Jewish populations and the number of illegal Jewish immigrants now in the country this would allow of the admission, as from the beginning of April this year, of some 75,000 immigrants over the next five years. These immigrants would, subject to the criterion of economic absorptive capacity, be admitted as follows *- (a) For each of the next five years a quota of 10,000 Jewish immigrants will be allowed on the understanding that a shortage in any one year may be added to the quotas of subsequent years within the five year period if economic absorptive capacity permits* (b) In addition, as a contribution towards the solution &lt; i ' ‘iKi • ,&gt;&gt; , of the Jewish refugee problem, 25,000 refugees will be admitted as soon as the High Commissioner is satisfied that adequate provision for their maintenance is ensured, special considera tion being given to refugee children and dependants* (ii) The existing machinery for ascertaining economic absorptive capacity will be retained and the High Commissioner will have the ultimate responsibility of deciding the limits of economic capacity. Before each periodic decision is taken Jewish and Arab representatives will be consulted. (iii) After the period of five years no further Jewish immigration will be permitted unless the Arabs of Palestine are prepared to acquiesce in it.(iv) His fciajeaty^s Government are determined to check illegal immigration and further preventive measures are being adopted. The numbers of any Jewish illegal immigrants who, despite these measures, may succeed in coming into the country and cannot be deported will be deducted from the yearly quotas. III. LAND The High Commissioner will be given general powers or to prohibit and regulate sales of land. These powers will date from the publication of this statement of policy and the High Commissioner will retain them throughout the period of transition. The policy of Government will be directed towards development of land and improvement, where possible, of methods of cultivation. In the light of such development it will be open to the High Commissioner, should he be satisfied that the rights and interests of the Arab population will be duly preserved, to review and modify any orders passed relating to the prohibition or restriction of transfers of land.Telegram R.35 From H.M 1 s Minister, Jedda, To Foreign Office, London, No. 64 Repeated Political Agent, Bahrain, No.4 Dated 13th received 14th May 1939. v'°‘ vi' Your telegrams 80 and 81. / Please see Bahrain telegram of May 7th I assume Bahrain not Jedda is to take action.

It was their sincere hope that, as a result of full, free and frank discussion, some under standing might be reached. Conferences recently took place with Arab and Jewish delegations, lasting for a period of several weeks, and served the purpose of a complete exchange of views between British Ministers and the Arab and Jewish representatives. In the light of the discussions as well as of the situation in Palestine and of the Reports of the Royal Com mission f and the Partition Commission^;, certain proposals were formulated by His Majesty’s Government and were laid before the Arab and Jewish delegations as the basis of an agreed settlement. Neither the Arab nor the Jewish delegations felt able to accept these proposals, and the conferences therefore did not result in an agreement. Accordingly His Majesty’s Government are free to formulate their own policy, and after careful consideration they have decided to adhere generally to the proposals which were finally submitted to, and discussed with, the Arab and Jewish delegations. 2. The Mandate for Palestine, the terms of which were con firmed by the Council of the League of Nations in 1922, has governed the policy of successive British Governments for nearly 20 years. It embodies the Balfour Declaration and im poses on the Mandatory four main obligations. These obliga tions are set out in Articles 2, 6 and 13 of the Mandate. There is no dispute regarding the interpretation of one of these obliga tions, that touching the protection of and access to the Holy Places and religious buildings or sites. The other three main obligations are generally as follows: — (i) To place the country under such political, adminis trative and economic conditions as will secure the estab lishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, to facilitate Jewish immigration under suitable conditions, and to encourage, in co-operation with the Jewish Agency, close settlement by Jews on the land. . (ii) To safeguard the civil and religious rights of all the inhabitants of Palestine irrespective of race and religion, and, whilst facilitating Jewish immigration and settlement! to ensure that the rights and position of other sections of the population are not prejudiced. (in) To place the countiy under such political, adminis trative and economic conditions as will secure the develop- ment of self-governing institutions. * Cmd. 5893. t Cmd. 5479. } r Cmd. 5854.A 2 16379 3- The Royal Commission and previous Commissions of Enquiry have drawn attention to the ambiguity of certain ex pressions in the Mandate, such as the expression “ a national home for the Jewish people ”, and they have found in this ambiguity and the resulting uncertainty as to the objectives of policy a fundamental cause of unrest and hostility between Arabs and Jews. His Majesty’s Government are convinced that in the interests of the peace and well-being of the whole people of Palestine a clear definition of policy and objectives is essential. The proposal of partition recommended by the Royal Commission would have afforded such clarity, but the establishment of self-supporting independent Arab and Jewish States within Palestine has been found to be impracticable. It has therefore been necessary for His Majesty’s Government to devise an alternative policy which will, consistently with their obligations to Arabs and Jews, meet the needs of the situation in Palestine. Their views and proposals are set forth below under the three heads, (I) The Constitution, (II) Immigration, and (III) Land. I.—The Constitution. 4. It has been urged that the expression ' a national home for the Jewish people ” offered a prospect that Palestine might in due course become a Jewish State or Commonwealth. His Majesty’s Government do not wish to contest the view, which was expressed by the Royal Commission, that the Zionist leaders at the time of the issue of the Balfour Declaration recognised that an ultimate Jewish State was not precluded by the terms of the Declaration. But, with the Royal Commission, His Majesty’s Government believe that the framers of the Mandate in which the Balfour Declaration was embodied could not have intended that Palestine should be converted into a Jewish State against the will of the Arab population of the country. That Palestine was not to be converted into a Jewish State might be held to be implied in the passage from the Command Paper of 1922* which reads as follows: — ' Unauthorised statements have been made to the effect that the purpose in view is to create a wholly Jewish Pales tine. Phrases have been used such as that ' Palestine is to become as Jewish as England is English ’. His Majesty’s Government regard any such expectation as impracticable and have no such aim in view. Nor have they at any time contemplated the disappearance or the subordination of the Arabic population, language or culture in Palestine. They would draw attention to the fact that the terms of the (Balfour) Declaration referred to do not contemplate that Palestine as a whole should be converted into a * Cmd. 1700.4 Jewish National Home, but that such a Home should be founded in Palestine ”. But this statement has not removed doubts, and His Majesty’s Government therefore now declare unequivocally that it is not part of their policy that Palestine should become a Jewish State. They would indeed regard it as contrary to their obligations to the Arabs under the Mandate, as well as to the assurances which have been given to the Arab people in the past, that the Arab population of Palestine should be made the subjects of a Jewish State against their will. 5. The nature of the Jewish National Home in Palestine was further described in the Command Paper of 1922 as follows: — “ During the last two or three generations the Jews have recreated in Palestine a community, now numbering 80,000, of whom about one-fourth are farmers or workers upon the land. This community has its own political organs; an elected assembly for the direction of its domestic concerns; elected councils in the towns; and an organisation for the control of its schools. It has its elected Chief Rabbinate and Rabbinical Council for the direction of its religious affairs. Its business is conducted in Hebrew as a ver nacular language, and a Hebrew press serves its needs. It has its distinctive intellectual life and displays considerable economic activity. This community, then, with its town and country population, its political, religious and social organisations, its own language, its own customs, its own life, has in fact ‘ national ’ characteristics. When it is asked what is meant by the development of the Jewish National Home in Palestine, it may be answered that it is not the imposition of a Jewish nationality upon the inhabitants of Palestine as a whole, but the further develop ment of the existing Jewish community, with the assistance of Jews in other parts of the world, in order that it may become a centre in which the Jewish people as a whole may take, on grounds of religion and race, an interest and a pride. But in order that this community should have the best prospect of free development and provide a full opportunity for the Jewish people to display its capacities, it is essential that it should know that it is in Palestine as of right and not on sufferance. That is the reason why it is necessary that the existence of a Jewish National Home in Palestine should be internationally guaranteed, and that it should be formally recognised to rest upon ancient historic connection ”. 6. His Majesty’s Government adhere to this interpretation of the Declaration of 1917 and regard it as an authoritative and comprehensive description of the character of the Jewish National Home in Palestine. It envisaged ^ the further development of the existing Jewish community with the'i' 5 assistance of Jews in other parts of the world. Evidence that His Majesty's Government have been carrying out their obliga tion in this respect is to be found in the facts that, since the statement of 1922 was published, more than 300,000 Jews have immigrated to Palestine, and that the population of the National Home has risen to some 450,000, or approaching a third of the entire population of the country. Nor has the Jewish com munity failed to take full advantage of the opportunities given to it. The growth of the Jewish National Home and its achieve ments in many fields are a remarkable constructive effort which must command the admiration of the world and must be, in particular, a source of pride to the Jewish people. 7. In the recent discussions the Arab delegations have repeated the contention that Palestine was included within the area in which Sir Henry McMahon, on behalf of the British Government, in October, 1915, undertook to recognise and support Arab independence. The validity of this claim, based on the terms of the correspondence which passed between Sir Henry McMahon and the Sharif of Mecca, was thoroughly and carefully investigated by British and Arab representatives during the recent conferences in London. Their Report, which has been published,* states that both the Arab and the British representatives endeavoured to understand the point of view of the other party but that they were unable to reach agreement upon an interpretation of the correspondence. There is no need to summarise here the arguments presented by each side. His Majesty's Government regret the misunderstandings which have arisen as regards some of the phrases used. For their part they can only adhere, for the reasons given by their representatives in the Report, to the view that the whole of Palestine west of Jordan was excluded from Sir Henry McMahon’s pledge, and they therefore cannot agree that the McMahon correspondence forms a just basis for the claim that Palestine should be converted into an Arab State. 8. His Majesty’s Government are charged as the Mandatory authority “ to secure the development of self-governing institu tions ” in Palestine. Apart from this specific obligation, they would regard it as contrary to the whole spirit of the Mandate system that the population of Palestine should remain for ever under Mandatory tutelage. It is proper that the people of the country should as early as possible enjoy the rights of self- government which are exercised by the people of neighbouring countries. His Majesty's Government are unable at present to foresee the exact constitutional forms which government in Palestine will eventually take, but their objective is self-govern ment, and they desire to see established ultimately an indepen dent Palestine State. It should be a State in which the two * Cmd. 5974.6 peoples in Palestine, Arabs and Jews, share authority in government in such a way that the essential interests of each are secured. 9. The establishment of an independent State and the com plete relinquishment of Mandatory control in Palestine would require such relations between the Arabs and the Jews as would make good government possible. Moreover, the growth of self-governing institutions in Palestine, as in other countries, must be an evolutionary process. A transitional period will be required before independence is achieved, throughout which ultimate responsibility for the Government of the country will be retained by His Majesty’s Government as the Mandatory authority, while the people of the country are taking an increasing share in the Government, and understanding and co-operation amongst them are growing. It will be the constant endeavour of His Majesty’s Government to promote good relations between the Arabs and the Jews. 10. In the light of these considerations His Majesty’s Govern ment make the following declaration of their intentions regard ing the future government of Palestine: — (1) The objective of His Majesty’s Government is the establishment within ten years of an independent Palestine State in such treaty relations with the United Kingdom as will provide satisfactorily for the commercial and strategic requirements of both countries in the future. This proposal for the establishment of the independent State would involve consultation with the Council of the League of Nations with a view to the termination of the Mandate. (2) The independent State should be one in which Arabs and Jews share in government in such a way as to ensure that the essential interests of each community are safe guarded. (3) The establishment of the independent State will be preceded by a transitional period throughout which His Majesty’s Government will retain responsibility for the government of the country. During the transitional period the people of Palestine will be given an increasing part in the government of their country. Both sections of the population will have an opportunity to participate in the machinery of government, and the process will be carried on whether or not they both avail themselves of it. (4) As soon as peace and order have been sufficiently restored in Palestine steps will be taken to carry out this policy of giving the people of Palestine an increasing part in the government of their country, the objective being to place Palestinians in charge of all the Departments of Government, with the assistance of British advisers and7 subject to the control of the High Commissioner. With this object in view His Majesty's Government will be prepared immediately to arrange that Palestinians shall be placed in charge of certain Departments, with British advisers. The Palestinian heads of Departments will sit on the Executive Council, which advises the High Commissioner. Arab and Jewish representatives will be invited to serve as heads of Departments approximately in proportion to their respec tive populations. The number of Palestinians in charge of Departments will be increased, as circumstances permit until all heads of Departments are Palestinians, exercising the administrative and advisory functions which are at present performed by British officials. When that stage is reached consideration will be given to the question of converting the Executive Council into a Council of Ministers with a consequential change in the status and functions of the Palestinian heads of Departments. (5) His Majesty's Government make no proposals at this stage regarding the establishment of an elective legislature. Nevertheless they would regard this as an appropriate constitutional development, and, should public opinion in Palestine hereafter show itself in favour of such a develop ment, they will be prepared, provided that local conditions permit, to establish the necessary machinery. (6) At the end of five years from the restoration of peace and order, an appropriate body representative of the people of Palestine and of His Majesty's Government will be set up to review the working of the constitutional arrangements during the transitional period and to consider and make recommendations regarding the constitution of the independent Palestine State. (7) His Majesty’s Government will require to be satisfied that in the treaty contemplated by sub-paragraph (1) or in the constitution contemplated by sub-paragraph (6) adequate provision has been made for: — (а) the security of, and freedom of access to, the Holy Places, and the protection of the interests and property of the various religious bodies. (б) the protection of the different communities in Palestine in accordance with the obligations of His Majesty's Government to both Arabs and Jews and for the special position in Palestine of the Jewish National Home. (c) such requirements to meet the strategic situation as may be regarded as necessary by His Majesty’s Government in the light of the circumstances then existing.8 His Majesty’s Government will also require to be satisfied that the interests of certain foreign countries in Palestine, for the preservation of which they are at present responsible, are adequately safeguarded. (8) His Majesty’s Government will do everything in their power to create conditions which will enable the independent Palestine State to come into being within ten years. If, at the end of ten years, it appears to His Majesty’s Government that, contrary to their hope, circumstances require^ the postponement of the establish ment of the independent State, they will consult with representatives of the people of Palestine, the Council of the League of Nations and the neighbouring Arab States before deciding on such a postponement. If His Majesty's Government come to the conclusion that postponement is unavoidable, they will invite the co-operation of these parties in framing plans for the future with a view to achieving the desired objective at the earliest possible date. n. During the transitional period steps will be taken to increase the powers and responsibilities of municipal corpora tions and local councils. II.—Immigration. 12. Under Article 6 of the Mandate, the Administration of Palestine, “ while ensuring that the rights and position of other sections of the population are not prejudiced ”, is required to ” facilitate Jewish immigration under suitable conditions ”. Beyond this, the extent to which Jewish immigration into Pales tine is to be permitted is nowhere defined in the Mandate. But in the Command Paper of 1922 it was laid down that for the fulfilment of the policy of establishing a Jewish National Home 'it is necessary that the Jewish community in Palestine should be able to increase its numbers by immigration. This immigration cannot be so great in volume as to exceed whatever may be the economic capacity of the country at the time to absorb new arrivals. It is essential to ensure that the immigrants should not be a burden upon the people of Palestine as a whole, and that they should not deprive any section of the present population of their employment.” In practice, from that date onwards until recent times, the economic absorptive capacity of the country has been treated as the sole limiting factor, and in the letter which Mr. Ramsay MacDonald, as Prime Minister, sent to Dr. Weizmann in February 1931* it was laid down as a matter of policy that economic absorptive capacity was the sole criterion. This interpretation has been supported by resolutions of * Hansard, Vol. 248, 13/2/31, Cols. 751-7.9 the Permanent Mandates Commission. But His Majesty’s Government do not read either the Statement of Policy of 1922 or the letter of 1931 as implying that the Mandate requires them, for all time and in all circumstances, to facilitate the immi gration of Jews into Palestine subject only to consideration of the country’s economic absorptive capacity. Nor do they find anything in the Mandate or in subsequent Statements of Policy to support the view that the establishment of a Jewish National Home in Palestine cannot be effected unless immigration is allowed to continue indefinitely. If immigration has an adverse effect on the economic position in the country, it should clearly be restricted; and equally, if it has a seriously damaging effect on the political position in the country, that is a factor that should not be ignored. Although it is not difficult to contend that the large number of Jewish immigrants who have been admitted so far have been absorbed economically, the fear of the Arabs that this influx will continue indefinitely until the Jewish population is in a position to dominate them has pro duced consequences which are extremely grave for Jews and Arabs alike and for the peace and prosperity of Palestine. The lamentable disturbances of the past three years are only the latest and most sustained manifestation of this intense Arab apprehension. The methods employed by Arab terrorists against fellow-Arabs and Jews alike must receive unqualified condemnation. But it cannot be denied that fear of indefinite Jewish immigration is widespread amongst the Arab population and that this fear has made possible disturb ances which have given a serious setback to economic progress, depleted the Palestine exchequer, rendered life and property insecure, and produced a bitterness between the Arab and Jewish populations which is deplorable between citizens of the same country. If in these circumstances immigration is continued up to the economic absorptive capacity of the country, regardless of all other considerations, a fatal enmity between the two peoples will be perpetuated, and the situation in Palestine may become a permanent source of friction amongst all peoples in the Near and Middle East. His Majesty’s Government can not take the view that either their obligations under the Mandate, or considerations of common sense and justice, require that they should ignore these circumstances in framing immigration policy. 13 13. In the view of the Royal Commission, the association of the policy of the Balfour Declaration with the Mandate system implied the belief that Arab hostility to the former would sooner or later be overcome. It has been the hope of British Govern ments ever since the Balfour Declaration was issued that in time the Arab population, recognizing the advantages to be derived from Jewish settlement and development in Palestine, would become reconciled to the further growth of the Jewish10 National Home. This hope has not been fulfilled. The alterna tives before His Majesty’s Government are either (i) to seek to expand the Jewish National Home indefinitely by immigration, against the strongly expressed will of the Arab people of the country; or (ii) to permit further expansion of the Jewish National Home by immigration only if the Arabs are prepared to acquiesce in it. The former policy means rule by force. Apart from other considerations, such a policy seems to His Majesty’s Government to be contrary to the whole spirit of Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, as well as to their specific obligations to the Arabs in the Palestine Mandate. Moreover, the relations between the Arabs and the Jews in Palestine must be based sooner or later on mutual tolerance and goodwill; the peace, security and progress of the Jewish National Home itself require this. Therefore His Majesty's Government, after earnest consideration, and taking into account the extent to which the growth of the Jewish National Home has been facilitated over the last twenty years, have decided that the time has come to adopt in principle the second of the alternatives referred to above. 14. It has been urged that all further Jewish immigration into Palestine should be stopped forthwith. His Majesty’s Govern ment cannot accept such a proposal. It would damage the whole of the financial and economic system of Palestine and thus affect adversely the interests of Arabs and Jews alike. Moreover, in the view of His Majesty’s Government, abruptly to stop further immigration would be unjust to the Jewish National Home. But, above all, His Majesty’s Government are con scious of the present unhappy plight of large numbers of Jews who seek a refuge from certain European countries, and they believe that Palestine can and should make a further con tribution to the solution of this pressing world problem. In all these circumstances, they believe that they will be acting consistently with their Mandatory obligations to both Arabs and Jews, and in the manner best calculated to serve the interests of the whole people of Palestine, by adopting the following proposals regarding immigration: — (1) Jewish immigration during the next five years will be at a rate which, if economic absorptive capacity per mits, will bring the Jewish population up to approximately one-third of the total population of the country. Taking into account the expected natural increase of the Arab and Jewish populations, and the number of illegal Jewish immigrants now in the country, this would allow of the admission, as from the beginning of April this year, of some 75,000 immigrants over the next five years. These immigrants would, subject tothe criterion of economic absorptive capacity, be admitted as follows: — {a) For each of the next five years a quota of 10,000 Jewish immigrants will be allowed, on the under standing that a shortage in any one year may be added to the quotas for subsequent years, within the five- year period, if economic absorptive capacity permits. (6) In addition, as a contribution towards the solution of the Jewish refugee problem, 25,000 refugees will be admitted as soon as the High Commissioner is satisfied that adequate provision for their maintenance is ensured, special consideration being given to refugee children and dependants. (2) The existing machinery for ascertaining economic absorptive capacity will be retained, and the High Com missioner will have the ultimate responsibility for deciding the limits of economic capacity. Before each periodic decision is taken, Jewish and Arab representatives will be consulted. (3) After the period of five years no further Jewish immigration will be permitted unless the Arabs of Palestine are prepared to acquiesce in it. (4) His Majesty’s Government are determined to check illegal immigration, and further preventive measures are being adopted. The numbers of any Jewish illegal immi grants who, despite these measures, may succeed in coming into the country and cannot be deported will be deducted from the yearly quotas. 15. His Majesty’s Government are satisfied that, when the immigration over five years which is now contemplated has taken place, they will not be justified in facilitating, nor will they be under any obligation to facilitate, the further develop ment of the Jewish National Home by immigration regardless of the wishes of the Arab population. III.—Land. 16. The Administration of Palestine is required, under Article 6 of the Mandate, ' while ensuring that the rights and position of other sections of the population are not prejudiced ”, to encourage ” close settlement by Jews on the land ”, and no restriction has been imposed hitherto on the transfer of land from Arabs to Jews. The Reports of several expert Commissions have indicated that, owing to the natural growth of the Arab population and the steady sale in recent years of Arab land to Jews, there is now in certain areas no room for further transfers of Arab land, whilst in some other areas such transfers of land1 1 (16379—11) (Wt. 3635—4*58) 6000 5/39 P. St. G. 33s 12 must be restricted if Arab cultivators are to maintain their existing standard of life and a considerable landless Arab popu lation is not soon to be created. In these circumstances, the High Commissioner will be given general powers to prohibit and regulate transfers of land. These powers will date from the publication of this statement of policy and the High Commis sioner will retain them throughout the transitional period. 17. The policy of the Government will be directed towards the development of the land and the improvement, where possible, of methods of cultivation. In the light of such develop ment it will be open to the High Commissioner, should he be satisfied that the “ rights and position ” of the Arab population will be duly preserved, to review and modify any orders passed relating to the prohibition or restriction of the transfer of land. 18. In framing these proposals His Majesty's Government have sincerely endeavoured to act in strict accordance with their obligations under the Mandate to both the Arabs and the Jews. The vagueness of the phrases employed in some instances to describe these obligations has led to controversy and has made the task of interpretation difficult. His Majesty's Government cannot hope to satisfy the partisans of one party or the other in such controversy as the Mandate has aroused. Their purpose is to be just as between the two peoples in Palestine whose destinies in tnat country have been affected by the great events of recent years, and who, since they live side by side, must learn to practise mutual tolerance, goodwill and co-operation. In looking to the future, His Majesty's Govern ment are not blind to the fact that some events of the past make the task of creating these relations difficult; but they are encouraged by the knowledge that at many times and in many places in Palestine during recent years the Arab and Jewish inhabitants have lived in friendship together. Each community has much to contribute to the welfare of their common land, and each must earnestly desire peace in which to assist in increasing the well-being of the whole people of the country. The respon sibility which falls on them, no less than upon His Majesty’s Government, to co-operate together to ensure peace is all the more solemn because their country is revered by many millions of Moslems, Jews and Christians throughout the world who pray for peace in Palestine and for the happiness of her people.Confidential No, C/347-1.a/42 Political Agency, Bahrain, the 27th May 1939* To The Adviser to the Bahrain Government BAH BAIN Memorandum I enclose for your information a copy of the recently issued White Paper on Palestine. 2.

The most interesting aspect to me in this matter is to know the views of the people of Palestine.

My conversation with Husseini was of general nature about convincing the people of Palestine to be compliant in coming to an agreement with the British Government and x&amp;a stopping hostilities. I believe that the British Government do not harbour any ill intentions towards the Arabs and I realise the difficulties with which they are faced in the present circumstances in coming to a solution of the Palestine problem. I h&lt;bpe that peace will prevail in that country and that an agreement may be reached between the British Government and the Arabs in a manner which will safeguard the interests of both.

I will also urge them to send the money to them, and to discuss the reminder of the contributions. contributions were sent, neither do I know his calling nor the degree of his honesty, but the Committee has unanimously selected him and ± heard them talk about his religeousnes^, his position and his reputation. It never occured to me that such a man will betray his trust by putting the contributions to other purposes than those which were intended by the contributers. If the man is religeous surely he would not do that unless it is permissable for him to snatch the morsel from the mouths of orphans and widows. Moreover I heard them say that most of the contributions made by Arabs in and Muslims, including those from Kuwait, Dubai and India were sent to the Committee of this man and to another Committee in Iraq. With reference to your renarks about the Berlin broadcast, your surely know that this broadcast did not open except for the sole purpose of creating troubles and disturbances in all countries which have connections with Great Britain, therfore there is no wonder about what they broadcast. They may be having a correspondent to their own liking (an ememy of ours) and probably they themselves invent or remodel the information received by them in a manner which suits the purpose of I personally do not know the man to whom thetheir low type of propoganda in their efforts to sow the seeds of dissensions and disunity, by which means, they imagine, that troubles will be caused to Great Britain. When the Presidentship of the Committee was offered to me by its members I accepted it because I knew that Government had no objection. As regards the formation of other Committees in the States of the Gulf, this is purely an invention in which we are not interested. As you are sure of my sincerety and friendship, I request you to be assured, in accordance with my own belief, that it did not occur to any member of the Committee to work for any purpose other than for help to oraphans and widows.

These notes were transferred to IOR/R/15/2/200, and inserted after folio 219.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1 and terminates at the inside back cover with 292; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio. Arabic booklets are numbered in reverse order and these numbers are located in the top left corner. An additional foliation sequence is also present in parallel between ff 4-277; these numbers are also written in pencil, but are not circled. A previous foliation sequence, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file relates to the publication of the report of the Palestine Royal Commission, and British Government White Papers on Palestine, 1937-39; the reaction to them in Bahrain (and elsewhere in the Persian Gulf); the response of the King of Saudi Arabia [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd] (usually referred to in the papers as Ibn Saud) to British policy on Palestine; and fundraising in Bahrain for charitable causes in Palestine.The principal correspondents are the Political Agent, Bahrain; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Residency Agent, Sharjah; the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain (Charles Dalrymple Belgrave); and senior officials of the India Office and the Foreign Office.The papers cover: approaches to the Ruler of Bahrain [Shaikh Ḥamad bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah] by pro-Palestinian groups, and British advice that the Shaikh should ignore them, August-September 1936 (folios 5-13); the publication of the report of the Palestine Royal Commission (which proposed partition), May-August 1937 (folios 21-57), including the reaction of Ibn Saud (folios 31-32), the reaction in Bahrain, where the public was said to be 'not interested' (folio 35), distribution of Arabic copies of the report, (folios 41-44), and the reaction in the Gulf generally (folios 46-57); an appeal at Sharjah to the Muslims of the Trucial Coast to help the Palestinians, November-December 1937 (folios 65-73); publication of the White Paper
